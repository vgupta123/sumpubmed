BACKGROUND
the hox genes are a large family of homeobox-containing transcription factors that control morphologies on the body axis of nearly all metazoans. most of hox genes normally consist of two exons with the conserved 180-bp homeobox located in exon <dig>  in many animal species, hox genes are arranged in genomic clusters with up to  <dig> distinct gene members  <cit>  and, importantly, they are expressed in a "collinear fashion" -- anterior genes are expressed early in development and towards the front part of the embryo, posterior genes later in development and in more distal portions of the embryo  <cit> . due to their important roles involved in patterning the anterior-posterior axis, modifications in hox clusters might manifest in changes in the corresponding body regions; thus serve as a source of genetic innovations in shaping the diversification of metazoan body plans  <cit> .

because hox genes are of particular interest in understanding the genetic basis of morphological evolution of metazoans, they are frequently among the first genes examined in an evolutionary context. also hox clusters have been characterized in a variety of animal species. among chordates, the cephalochordate amphioxus possesses a single intact hox gene cluster with  <dig> members  <cit> ; in urochordate tunicates, the single cluster is secondarily broken and dispersed in the genome  <cit> . in contrast to these invertebrate chordates, primitive jawless vertebrates  possess three to seven hox clusters, most probably through independent cluster duplications in the agnathan lineage  <cit> . jawed vertebrates also have multiple clusters resulting from several rounds of genome-duplication events that occurred early in the evolution of vertebrates and some specific lineages. there are three or four clusters in chondrichthyans  <cit> , four clusters in lobe-finned fishes  <cit>  and tetrapods  <cit> , up to eight in ray-finned fishes  <cit>  and ~ <dig> in tetraploid salmonid species  <cit> . the variations in vertebrate hox clusters reflect a history of duplications and subsequent lineage-specific gene loss and can serve as models for studies of vertebrate genome evolution .

for the sarcopterygian lineage , all of its members investigated to date bear four clusters  but the number of gene members varies among different groups. mammals possess  <dig> hox genes. for birds, a recent report on genomic annotation of hox clusters in chicken  <cit>  deduced that birds may have the same hox gene inventory to mammals but two genes  are still missing due to the incompleteness of the chicken genome. in silico survey of frog   <cit>  and lizard   <cit>  revealed the persistence of hoxc <dig>  in both species, but two genes  are thought to have been lost in anuran amphibians. recent relevant studies have further reported that the absence of hoxb <dig> in frogs also occurs in caecilians, and the loss of hoxd <dig> in frogs also happens in salamanders, caecilians  <cit>  and snakes  <cit> . most recently, the complete hox clusters of the indonesian coelacanth , an early-branching sarcopterygian, have been sequenced  <cit> . compared to the tetrapod lineage, the coelacanth possesses  <dig> hox genes in total, lacking hoxd <dig>  but retaining the four genes  which were secondarily lost in mammals.

however, our knowledge of the hox genes and clusters along the sarcopterygian lineage remains incomplete because data from some major groups are still missing . for example, it is curious to see whether lungfishes possess hox <dig> and lost hoxd <dig> in their genomes  as coelacanths. on the other hand, a "snake-like" morphology  repeatedly occurs in different groups of amphibians and reptiles, such as snakes, caecilians and some legless lizards. there were published reports suggesting the "snake-like" body morphology may be due to altered expression of hox genes  <cit> . comparative analyses on the hox clusters among these special groups should be able to provide further hints on how such expression alterations happen. for sequencing of the hox clusters, a framework investigation of hox gene inventory in these groups  is needed.

pcr surveys have demonstrated their value for preliminary identification of hox genes in various animals  <cit> . however, pcr surveys of hox genes often encounter a bias of the preference of degenerate primers and therefore, the actual number of existing genes is underestimated  <cit> . to circumvent this problem, we designed at least two sets of degenerated primers targeting a given hox gene member, which increased the probability of successful amplification. furthermore, when possible, we selected at least two species that span a broad evolutionary range for each tested groups, for which the primer preference may be different, maximizing the probability of finding all genes for a group. by adopting the two strategies, we carried out a comprehensive pcr survey for hox genes in caecilians, salamanders, snakes, turtles, crocodiles, and lungfishes-the only other group of extant lobe-finned fishes beside coelacanths. we aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of hox cluster evolution within the sarcopterygian lineage and present a general picture of hox gene inventory variation among different sarcopterygian groups.

RESULTS
amplification and identification of hox gene fragments
for each of the six sarcopterygian species examined, we tried different combinations of the degenerate primers, some targeted to several paralogue groups , some to specific groups and others to specific gene members, to amplify the homeobox-encoding region or exon <dig> of hox genes . we did several rounds of pcr first using "general" degenerate primers, and then using more specific primers designed for paralogue groups or gene members that were not found in the initial survey. a total of  <dig> pcr fragments  were cloned and sequenced. detailed information about the library construction and screening efficiency for the six sarcopterygian species and other relevant species is listed in the additional file 1: statistics of the sequenced clones. occasionally, two sequences were found differing in only one to three nucleotides. when the nucleotide variations belong to synonymous substitutions and each of these sequences was present in more than one clone, they were considered as allelic variants. conversely, non-synonymous substitutions of one or two nucleotides in only one clone but not the others of the same fragment were regarded as pcr or sequencing errors and excluded from further analyses.

initial blast searches in genbank indicated that  <dig> - <dig> % sequenced clones belonged to hox fragments, depending on the animal species examined. this result demonstrated the utility and efficiency of our newly designed hox survey primers across most sarcopterygian lineages. based on the phylogenetic analyses at the protein level, we can unambiguously assign 70-75% of the obtained homeobox sequences to exact hox gene members. the phylogenetic signals in protein alignments of hox <dig>  hox6- <dig> were especially weak so that the phylogenetic analyses at the nucleic acid level were performed to putatively distinguish hox members for these paralogue groups. using this strategy, we were able to determine the orthology of all obtained hox fragments.

to test the credibility of our assignment of putative hox fragments based on the nucleic acid phylogenetic analyses, we chose two species  to perform the tail-pcr-based genome walking to get the 3' flanking sequences of their putative hox6- <dig> fragments. the newly obtained sequences were compared with known sarcopterygian hox genes, and all the assignments were verified.

hox gene inventories of different animal groups
lungfishes
protopterus annectens, the african lungfish, was found to have a total of  <dig> hox genes orthologous to genes of the four coelacanth hox clusters. generally the hox inventory of the african lungfish is quite similar to that of the coelacanth   <cit> , for example, they both possess hoxc <dig>  hoxc <dig> and hoxb10; but interestingly the african lungfish lacks hoxd <dig> while the coelacanth has no hoxd <dig>  moreover, because the coelacanth has a hoxa <dig> gene and chondrichthyans have a hoxd <dig> gene  <cit>  but all tetrapod species examined so far lack hox- <dig>  we wonder if hox <dig> member also exist in lungfishes and/or the basal tetrapod lineage, i.e. caecilians. to this end, an 84-bp-fragment conserved only in hox <dig> was tested by pcr in the african lungfish and the banna caecilian and only the african lungfish gave the band with expected size, suggesting that hox <dig> may have been lost in all tetrapods. however, no further assignment could be made for the lungfish hox <dig> fragment because of its short size. we thus performed genome walking towards both ends of this hox <dig> fragment and got full sequence of the exon <dig> of the lungfish hox <dig>  using the lamprey hox <dig> alpha as outgroup, phylogenetic analysis unambiguously assigned the lungfish's hox <dig> member as a hoxa <dig> . among all vertebrates investigated to date, only the coelacanths and the lungfishes which represent the only two groups of the extant lobe-finned fish possess hoxa <dig>  thus, hoxa <dig> seems to be characteristic of the lobe-finned fish hox repertoire.

caecilians
in the banna caecilian   <dig> unique hox gene fragments were found. besides the core set of hox genes , we identified a hoxc <dig> fragment as well as a hoxc <dig> fragment in the banna caecilian. the presence of hoxc <dig> in caecilians was further validated by screening the hox <dig> library  in gymnopis multiplicata, a representative of derived caecilians. because hoxc <dig> was also found in the frog  and the salamander , it seems that all living amphibians retain hoxc <dig>  therefore we did not perform further survey for hoxc <dig> in other caecilian species. in addition, after having tried different combinations of primers, we could not find fragments of hoxd <dig> and hoxb <dig> in the three tested caecilian species  which is consistent with the loss of hoxd <dig> and hoxb <dig> in caecilians previously reported by mannaert et al.  <cit> .

salamanders
compared with other animal groups, surveying the hox gene inventory for salamanders was more difficult. we tried several species but in none of them could we find more than thirty-three hox genes. in order to give a more integrated hox gene inventory of salamanders, we combined the results from two species  to represent the group. initial pcr survey of homeobox fragments in batrachuperus tibetanus, the tibetan mountain salamander, identified  <dig> hox gene fragments after sequencing over  <dig> clones. compared with the frog hox complement, hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxb <dig>  hoxb <dig> and hoxa <dig> were missing. the missing hox genes were further surveyed in another salamander pachytriton brevipes and two more hox members  were detected after sequencing  <dig> clones. to validate the potential presence of the remaining hox members, we turned to detect their respective exon1s and finally fragments of hoxa <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxb <dig> and hoxb <dig> were found. consistent with the previous reports of the presence of hoxb <dig> in salamandrids  <cit>  and ambystomatids , we identified hoxb <dig> in the more basal hynobiid salamander , suggesting the presence of hoxb <dig> is likely a universal feature of all salamanders. likewise, we did not detect hoxd <dig> in all salamanders investigated , in accordance with the previous survey result  <cit> . altogether, salamanders have  <dig> hox genes with the presence of hoxc <dig> and absence of hoxd <dig> and unlike the other two amphibian groups, salamanders possess hoxb <dig> 

frogs
the genomic architecture of hox clusters of the frog  has been previously reported  <cit>  but hoxb <dig> was not detected in its genome due to a sequencing gap. however, hoxb <dig> mrna was cloned in another frog , indicating that frogs possess hoxb <dig> gene. in total, frogs have  <dig> hox genes, lacking hoxb <dig> and hoxd <dig>  but retaining hoxc <dig> 

lizards and snakes
di-poï et al.  <cit>  analyzed the genome data of the green anole lizard  and reported that lizards have  <dig> hox gene with an additional hoxc <dig> gene which is absent in mammals. however, hoxb <dig> and hoxd <dig> were only deduced genes in their study, not directly detected due to some sequencing gaps. we reanalyzed the flanking sequences of these gaps and identified fragments orthologous to hoxb <dig>  and hoxd <dig> , improving the completeness of lizards' hox gene inventory.

for snakes, we found  <dig> unique hox sequences in the chinese cobra . like lizards, snakes also have a hoxc <dig> gene. to see if the presence of hoxc <dig> is a characteristic of all squamates, we further surveyed the hox- <dig> genes in two other squamate species: gecko  and blind skink , belonging to two basal squamate groups gekkonidae and dibamidae, respectively. as a result, fragments of hoxc <dig> were unambiguously identified in the two species , suggesting all squamates should possess hoxc <dig> 

despite hoxd <dig> having been annotated in the green anole lizard, we did not detect hoxd <dig> fragment in the chinese cobra after screening the hox <dig> libraries constructed with different primer pairs. absence of hoxd <dig> has just been reported in the corn snake recently  <cit> . since both the chinese cobra and the corn snake belong to derived snakes, to further test if hoxd <dig> is absent in all snakes, we surveyed hox <dig> in two other snakes: blind snake  and ball python  which occupy more basal positions on the serpentes tree and might be able to circumvent the hox12-specific primer bias if there were any. as a result, only hoxc <dig> fragment could be found in these two snakes as well . therefore, it is likely that snakes have lost hoxd <dig> 

turtles
pelodiscus sinensis, which is also known as the chinese soft-shell turtle, was found to have  <dig> hox genes, lacking hoxc <dig> compared with lizards. since the squamate reptiles investigated so far have retained hoxc <dig>  we wondered if the missing of hoxc <dig> in turtles was due to primer bias. so we surveyed hox <dig> genes in another four turtles: the yellow-spotted amazon river turtle , the pig-nosed turtle , the painted turtle  and the red-eared slider turtle , which were particularly selected to represent a broad evolutionary coverage for turtles. as a result, no fragments of hoxc <dig> could be identified , which is consistent with the loss of hoxc <dig> in turtles.

crocodiles
for the siamese crocodile , most hox genes were found as expected using the chicken hox gene inventory  <cit>  as reference. however, only one homeobox fragment was retrieved for hox <dig> which usually contains two members  though several primer combinations have been tried. because the loss of hoxa <dig> or hoxb <dig> has never been reported in other vertebrates, we used primers targeting exon <dig> for hoxa <dig> and hoxb <dig> and were able to identify specific fragments for both genes in the siamese crocodile. in addition, hoxc <dig> was not detected in the siamese crocodile and its absence in crocodiles was further validated in the chinese alligator , a representative of the other major clade of living crocodiles. thus crocodiles have  <dig> hox genes and their hox gene inventory is the same as that of mammals.

birds
though the genomic annotation of hox clusters has been reported for the chicken , information for hoxc <dig> and hoxc <dig> is still missing due to incomplete genomic assembly  <cit> . and because of the gap at the 3' end of the hoxc cluster in the chicken genome, we do not know whether chicken has hoxc <dig> or not. besides, we found the homeobox of the predicted chicken hoxc <dig>  differs a lot from its orthologs in other vertebrates and may have assembly errors. in our pcr survey we confirmed the presence of chicken hoxc <dig> and hoxc <dig> by finding their respective homeobox fragments. to test whether birds retain hoxc <dig>  we surveyed hox <dig> genes in two birds: the domestic duck  and the ostrich , representing two major bird lineages  respectively. as a result, hoxc <dig> was not detected, suggesting it was lost in birds . the reexamination of hox <dig> in chicken, duck and ostrich confirmed the presence of hoxd <dig> in birds and revealed a fragment appearing well conserved with hoxc12s in other vertebrates, which, we think, represents the true bird hoxc <dig> . hence, with the detection of hoxc <dig>  hoxc <dig>  hoxc <dig> and hoxd <dig> in birds, our data provides a more complete picture of avian hox gene inventory.

mammals
although the hox gene inventory for placental mammals  is clear, the relevant information for the other two major groups of extant mammals: marsupials, monotremes, has not been reported yet. we therefore performed an in silico survey of hox genes for the grey short-tailed opossum monodelphis domestica  and the duck-billed platypus ornithorhynchus anatinus . in both species, the hox a, b, and d clusters are almost identical to those in human . for the hoxc cluster, the platypus lacks genomic sequences covering hoxc <dig>  hoxc <dig> and its 3' flanking region; the opossum lacks almost the entire genomic sequences of the hoxc cluster, except fragments of hoxc <dig> and hoxc <dig>  based on the observation that the architecture of hoxc13-c <dig> is conserved among all tetrapods, it is tempting to infer that marsupials and monotremes possess the same hoxc members as well. however, because the genomic sequences of the 3' flanking region of hoxc <dig> in both the opossum and the platypus are still missing, it would be premature to derive any conclusions about the presence/absence of hoxc <dig> in marsupials and monotremes.

the general scenario
combining our data with other published data, we are now able to provide a more complete scenario of how hox gene inventory variation occurs along major sarcopterygian lineages, from lobe-finned fishes to mammals . on the whole, the four-cluster hox architecture is well conserved; relatively basal lineages tend to retain more hox gene members. the hoxa <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> were consecutively lost during the process of sarcopterygian evolution. hoxd <dig> and hoxb <dig> seem to be two hotspots of gene loss and different animal groups may have lost these hox genes independently.

hox gene variation among sarcopterygian lineages and its evolutionary implications
the loss of hoxd <dig> is not directly related to digit reduction
mannaert et al.  <cit>  have proposed the absence of hoxd <dig> in amphibians be related to the absence of the fifth finger as frogs and salamanders normally have only four fingers and caecilian is limbless. in such a view, hoxd <dig> would be frequently lost in limbless animals . the hypothesis seems reasonable because hoxd <dig> does be lost in the snake  and the african lungfish  according to our hox gene survey. however, besides snakes, there are many other squamates with snake-like, limbless body forms. it is necessary to test the hypothesis more strictly in these limbless animals as well. to this end, we further surveyed hox <dig> genes in other limbless lizards, such as amphisbaena caeca , blanus strauchi , ophisaurus harti , anniella pulchra , typhlosaurus sp.  and dibamus bourreti , representing a broad evolutionary coverage for squamates. to our surprise, both hoxc <dig> and d <dig> could be unambiguously detected in all these limbless animals . this result indicated that the loss of hoxd <dig> is not as directly related to the digit-reduction phenotype as previously proposed.

the significance of hoxd <dig> retention in lungfishes
while the other group of extant lobe-finned fish, the coelacanths, has lost hoxd <dig>  <cit> , a hoxd <dig> fragment was identified from the african lungfish in our pcr survey. previous knock-out experiments in mice have demonstrated that hoxd <dig> is essential in the autopodium formation for tetrapods  <cit> , so it is easy to understand the fact that all tetrapods investigated so far possess the hoxd <dig> gene. therefore, the retention of hoxd <dig> which is shared by tetrapods and lungfishes but not coelacanths, is consistent with lungfishes being the closest living sistergroup of tetrapods, a widely accepted relationship among coelacanths, lungfishes and tetrapods  <cit> .

strictly, small hox gene fragments generated by pcr surveys are not definite evidences for the absence/presence of a gene, for example, the hoxd <dig> fragment in the goldfish carassius auratus auratus is thought to represent a pseudo gene  <cit> . therefore, we wonder whether the african lungfish hoxd <dig> is really a functional gene. to address this issue, genome walking was performed to obtain the 5' region of the homeobox of the lungfish hoxd <dig>  including the intron and the complete exon <dig>  no premature stop codons were observed, indicating the african lungfish hoxd <dig> is not a pseudo gene. sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis show that, the tetrapod hoxd13s are more similar to the african lungfish hoxd <dig> than to that of bony fishes  or cartilaginous fishes  . although the lungfish has no "digits", its hoxd <dig> may represent the intermediate form towards the functions in tetrapod hoxd13s during the fin-to-limb transitional history. in the future it would be interesting to perform "replacement" experiments in mice to see to what extent the lungfish hoxd <dig> could rescue the functions of the tetrapod hoxd <dig> especially in terms of autopodium formation.

the variation of hoxc <dig> shows clues for turtles' position on the amniote tree
the phylogenetic position of turtles is the most controversial issue in the reconstruction of the living amniote tree of life. after many different kinds of investigations from both molecular and morphological data, four main hypotheses concerning the phylogenetic relationships of turtles to the other groups of living amniotes have been proposed  <cit> :  turtles as the only living representatives of anapsid reptiles, and as the sister-group of diapsid reptiles, i.e., the lepidosauria  + archosauria ;  turtles placed within diapsids, and as the sister-group of the lepidosauria;  turtles as diapsids, and as the sister-group of the archosauria;  turtles as diapsids, but placed inside the archosauria, and as the sister-group of crocodiles. most morphological studies favor either hypothesis a  <cit>  or b  <cit>  and hypothesis a is the traditional view of the placement of turtles. in contrast to morphological views, recent molecular phylogenetic studies tend to support either hypotheses c or d and reject hypotheses a and b  <cit> . however, due to a severe slow down of substitution rate in turtles relative to diapsid reptiles  <cit> , we can not rule out the possibility that the molecular turtle-archosaur relationship is caused by analytical artifacts. therefore, besides traditional morphological inferences and sequence-based molecular phylogenetic analyses, a third form of data is needed to explore and test the alternative phylogenetic hypotheses of the turtle's placement.

the presence of hoxc <dig> gene among living amniote lineages seems a good indicator of their interrelationships. since both lobe-finned fishes and amphibians possess hoxc <dig>  the presence of hoxc <dig> is most likely the ancestral state for amniotes. according to our survey, for living amniotes, only squamates  retained hoxc <dig>  and other groups  all lost this gene. following the principle of dollo parsimony - which assumes that losses of genes are much more common and likely than independent evolutionary origins, - we can evaluate the four hypotheses about the position of turtles mentioned above. both hypotheses a and b require  <dig> steps of independent loss of hoxc <dig> in mammals, turtles and archosaurs while hypotheses c and d need only two steps. consequently, our hox gene inventory data is in line with most recent molecular studies favoring a turtle-archosaur relationship but unable to discriminate between hypotheses c and d. considering that archosauria is a well supported clade, we tentatively accept hypothesis c and illustrate turtles' position as shown in figure  <dig> 

the retention of hoxc <dig> in caecilians supports the batrachia hypothesis
because sharks, many teleost fishes, lobe-finned fishes all possess hoxc <dig> but all tetrapod species examined before this study lack this gene, kuraku and meyer  <cit>  deduced that tetrapod ancestors lost their hoxc <dig> gene when they diverged from lobe-finned fishes. however, our finding of hoxc <dig> in caecilians suggested that tetrapod ancestors actually retained hoxc <dig> gene but subsequently lost in different lineages. the presence of hoxc <dig> likely represents a "fish-style" hox gene inventory and only basal tetrapod lineages have the possibility to retain this gene. amphibians definitely branch first from the tetrapod tree and comprise of three distinct living groups: frogs, salamanders and caecilians  <cit> . the retention of hoxc <dig> in caecilians but not in frogs and salamanders implied that among the three living amphibian groups, caecilians are more distantly related to frogs and salamanders, supporting the batrachia hypothesis  advocated by most recent molecular studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we performed a comprehensive pcr survey of hox genes for six major sarcopterygian groups: lungfishes, caecilians, salamanders, snakes, turtles and crocodiles and clarified some uncertainties of birds' hox gene inventory. our study provided a more complete scenario for evolutionary dynamics of hox genes along major sarcopterygian lineages. on the whole, hox gene inventories of sarcopterygians are rather conserved with only little variations occurring in the anterior or posterior hox paralogue groups. the hox gene inventories of limbless caecilians and snakes largely resemble those of animals with less derived body morphology, suggesting changes to their body morphology were likely due to other modifications rather than changes to hox gene numbers. in future, it is interesting to sequence the entire hox clusters for these animals and our work can serve as basis for this purpose.
