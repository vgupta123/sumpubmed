BACKGROUND
h. pylori is a microaerophilic, spiral shaped gram-negative bacterium that chronically infects the gastric mucosa
 <cit> . it is recognised as a human pathogen associated with chronic gastritis
 <cit> , peptic ulcer
 <cit>  and gastric cancer
 <cit> , the development of which are related to the virulence factors cytotoxin associated antigen 
 <cit>  and vacuolating cytotoxin a 
 <cit> . it has been reported that caga and vaca polymorphisms are associated with distinct pathological features in h. pylori infected adults with gastrointestinal diseases
 <cit> .

caga has emerged as a major virulence factor for gastroduodenal disease severity, including an increased cancer risk
 <cit> . caga is injected into epithelial cells mediated by a type iv secretion system
 <cit> . in the host cell, caga localises to the inner surface of the plasma membrane and becomes phosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues within repeating penta amino acid glu-pro-ile-tyr-ala  motifs present at the c-terminus of the protein
 <cit> . this part of the protein is encoded by the variable 3’-region of the caga gene
 <cit>  . four different caga epiya motifs have been defined according to the amino acid sequence that surrounds the epiya residues; epiya-a, -b, -c and -d
 <cit> . caga toxins nearly always possess epiya-a and epiya-b, followed by varying numbers of epiya-c in western-type isolates
 <cit> . in east asian-type of clinical h. pylori isolates, epiya-a and -b are, on the other hand, commonly followed by an epiya-d motif
 <cit> . it has been suggested that the considerable variation in number of repeating epiya-c motifs at the c-terminus of the protein may alter the biological activity of caga in phosphorylation-dependent as well as phosphorylation-independent ways
 <cit> . it was suggested that the number of caga epiya-c motifs and the tyrosine phosphorylation status of caga are important risk factors for gastric cancer among western strains
 <cit> . this is also supported by a higher risk of cancer development in strains with a high degree of phosphorylation
 <cit> .

vaca induces vacuolisation in gastric epithelial cells by attaching to the cell membrane
 <cit> . it also induces apoptosis in these cells via the mitochondrial pathway
 <cit> . initially, dna sequence analysis revealed that the vaca protein has a mosaic structure comprising allelic variations in the signal  and mid region  , each having two different alleles  with different biological activities
 <cit> . the s and m regions have been associated with gastric cancer and the premalignant condition gastric mucosal atrophy
 <cit> . recently, it was proposed that an intermediate  region, located between the s and m regions , is associated with gastric cancer
 <cit> . similarly, a novel vaca gene deletion  region  has been described
 <cit> . the d region is located between the vaca i and m regions, and involves a cleavage site crucial for the protein function and is associated with gastroduodenal diseases
 <cit> . amino-acid alterations in the repeated hydrophilic motif region , largely overlapping the d region of vaca, were previously shown not to be associated with any specific gastroduodenal disease
 <cit> .

h. pylori caga and vaca gene polymorphisms are well studied and it is assumed that these polymorphisms, alone or in concert, are associated in h. pylori associated pathogenesis
 <cit> . however, some studies have reported a lack of association between h. pylori caga and vaca gene polymorphisms and the severity or progression of h. pylori associated diseases
 <cit> .

statistical outcome is dependent on the population studied. we aimed to analyse a randomly selected population in south-eastern sweden with regard to h. pylori caga and vaca genotypes and sequelae using logistic regression analysis. by means of a previously described pcr-based strategy
 <cit>  we assessed variations of caga epiya and vaca s/m/i/d mosaic structure present in h. pylori dna isolated from  <dig> fresh frozen  gastric biopsy specimens.

RESULTS
presence of h. pylori dna in the gastric biopsy specimens
using mda-dna and 16s rdna variables v <dig> region pyrosequencing analysis, the presence of h. pylori-dna in all  <dig> biopsy specimens was confirmed.

analysis of caga epiya motifs
a total of  <dig> gastric biopsy specimens from  <dig> individuals were analysed for caga epiya genotypes. in  <dig> biopsy specimens a single caga amplicon was detected. dna sequencing revealed the presence of different caga epiya genotypes: epiya-ab in two, abc in  <dig>  abcc in  <dig>  and abccc, ac, acc, aabc, aabcc in one biopsy each . in  <dig> biopsy specimens positive for the caga epiya motif, two or more caga amplicons were detected. of these  <dig> specimens, the majority  were mixes between abc and abcc . from  <dig> biopsy dna samples, no caga epiya motif amplicons could be generated.
 <dig>  n = number of strains.

statistical analysis revealed that h. pylori strains with different number of caga epiya motif variants present in the same biopsy was correlated to peptic ulcer development, or =  <dig>  . in the present study, peptic ulcer included four cases of duodenal ulcers, three pre-pyloric ulcers, two gastric ulcers and five cases of previously diagnosed ulcers of undefined origin .

two or more caga epiya-c motifs were associated with development of gastric atrophy, or =  <dig>  . in biopsies with mixed amplicons, the number of epiya-c was determined from the amplicon with the highest number of repeats. gastritis was histologically classified according to the sydney system, and atrophy of the gastric mucosa was graded from 1– <dig> 
 <cit> . for the purpose of the present study, moderate to severe atrophy of the gastric mucosa was classified as atrophic gastritis.

statistical calculations were performed also in subgroups based on the location in the stomach . no differences were observed between the groups regarding their respective disease progression.

analysis of cage and cag-pai empty-site
to detect deletions of caga within cagpai, a region surrounding caga  was amplified, as well as the cage gene . amplification of cage was successful in  <dig> of the biopsies. of the remaining  <dig> biopsies, only  <dig> successfully amplified the cag-pai empty site region, indicating the presence of mutated primer target sites or absence of cage.

analysis of vaca s/i/d/m-region
four regions of the vaca gene  were genotyped. pcr amplification and dna sequence analysis in 155 h. pylori positive biopsy specimens revealed full information from all regions of vaca in  <dig> samples. of the samples genotyped in the s region, the majority were of s1a  or s1b  genotype, while only three samples were s <dig> genotype. in the m region the distribution was more even, with  <dig> samples of m <dig> genotype and  <dig> samples of m <dig> genotype. dna from  <dig> of the biopsies displayed a deletion of the d region , while  <dig> isolates showed wild-type sequence  in this region. the intermediate region is classified according to two different sequences, and may be of i <dig>  i <dig>  i1-i <dig> or i2-i <dig> genotype. in this material,  <dig> isolates were of i <dig> genotype,  <dig> isolates of i <dig> genotype and  <dig> isolates of i2-i <dig> genotype. none were of i1-i <dig> type.

the genotypes of these regions were divided into three groups ; group  <dig> contained  <dig> isolates of s1-d1-m <dig> genotype , group  <dig> contained  <dig> isolates that were of d1-m <dig> genotypes , and group  <dig> contained  <dig> isolates that were of d <dig> genotype . isolates that were indeterminate in one or more regions  were excluded from this compilation.

in group  <dig>  there were two isolates  derived from peptic ulcer patients, while in group  <dig> and  <dig> there were  <dig> isolates  and eight isolates , respectively, originating from ulcer patients. the lower frequency of peptic ulcer observed in vaca s1d1m <dig> genotype compared to other genotypes was not statistically significant. eight biopsies from group  <dig>  and two biopsies from group  <dig>  were derived from patients with atrophic gastritis, while in group three there was no subject with atrophic gastritis .

intraindividual variations of caga epiya and vaca genotypes in corpus, antrum and duodenal bulb
in  <dig> of  <dig> individuals, biopsy specimens from all three locations of the stomach  were available for analysis. in  <dig> of these  <dig> subjects, the caga and vaca genotypes were identical in all locations. considering the remaining  <dig> subjects,  <dig> subjects differed with respect to the caga epiya genotype, two with regard to the vaca  genotype, two considering the vaca  genotype and one with respect to the vaca  genotype, when comparing the locations for each subject .

discussion
the results of several studies have indicated that there is an association between the caga gene and gastric cancer
 <cit> . there are also reports showing an association between the vaca gene and gastroduodenal sequelae  of h. pylori infection
 <cit> .

here we show that of the individuals with biopsies from all locationsns , 49% had different caga epiya genotype between the three locations. there is a possibility that these individuals may have been infected with different strains on different occasions. however, it is perhaps more likely those h. pylori strains acquired genetic alterations in caga after infection. three recombination mechanisms have been detected in the caga gene; homologous recombination between cm sequences, recombination between epiya sequences or between short similar sequences
 <cit> . these recombination mechanisms, as well as mutations in the gene, may serve as a driving force for generating strain diversity in h. pylori, also called microevolution
 <cit> . it is possible that infection with multiple h. pylori ancestral strains or alternatively, a single ancestral strain undergoing microevolution in the caga gene giving rise to h. pylori subclones with different caga epiya motif variants in the same biopsy specimen, may be more aggressive than a single ancestral strains acting alone. in an early study it has been suggested that the majority of swedish clinical isolates of h. pylori from patients of higher age  represent single strain infections. however, in younger ages multiple strain infection may be more common
 <cit> . furthermore, it has been discussed that different subclones of each strain, some of which might be caga-positive or -negative, may coexist, possibly colonising different areas of the stomach during different periods of life-long h pylori infection
 <cit> . in this context, the aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between the presence of h. pylori caga epiya motifs and disease outcome. we found an association between h. pylori dna isolated from the same biopsy specimen and generating two or more caga epiya motif variant amplicons and peptic ulcer or =  <dig>  .

gastric atrophy was associated with two or more epiya-c motifs in the caga gene of the biopsy  h. pylori strains, or =  <dig>  . previous studies have also found this correlation
 <cit>  and it has been suggested that a higher number of epiya-c motifs enables a higher degree of phosphorylation, and, hence, increases the risk of gastric cancer and gastric intestinal metaplasia
 <cit> . one explanatory mechanism in this aspect may be the interaction of caga with the protein aspp <dig>  which normally activates p <dig> to induce apoptosis. caga inhibits aspp <dig>  leading to an increased cell survival and enhanced transformation of the cell
 <cit> .

other studies have shown an association of gastric cancer and atrophy to the s <dig> genotype
 <cit> , the s1m <dig> genotype
 <cit> , or the i <dig> genotype
 <cit> . in the present study, we detected a higher frequency of atrophy among the vaca s1d1m <dig> genotype than among other genotypes. however, none of these results were statistically significant, which could be due to small or unevenly distributed groups of samples .

miernyk and co-workers observed an increased risk of developing peptic ulcer disease in s1m <dig> compared to s1m2/s2m <dig> vaca genotype
 <cit> . our study shows a tendency towards a similar association, although not statistically significant.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, h. pylori strains with variation in the number of caga epiya motif variants present in the same biopsy were associated with the occurrence of peptic ulcer. similarly, two or more epiya-c motifs were associated with atrophy in the gastric mucosa. no statistically significant association between vaca genotypes and gastroduodenal pathogenesis was observed.
