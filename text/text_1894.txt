BACKGROUND
methamphetamine is a highly addictive psychostimulant reported to be the second most highly abused illegal drug in the world  <cit> . intoxication causes euphoria and hyperactivity, as well as depression, anxiety and psychosis  <cit> . extensive gene expression changes following high levels of methamphetamine have been observed in the brain, causing dopaminergic terminal degeneration in many rodent models  <cit> .

pre-clinical research using experimenter-administered  exposure to methamphetamine has shown extensive gene expression changes in various brain regions . acute experimenter-administered methamphetamine increases the expression of a number of immediate early genes, including those encoding transcription factors, c-fos, arc, nfκb, preprodynorphin, fra <dig>  egr1- <dig>  nr4a <dig> and nr4a <dig> in the striatum  <cit> . chronic methamphetamine exposure has been shown to alter genes involved in gtpase signaling, apoptosis, and cell cycle control in the striatum, in addition to the well-established addiction associated genes fos, arc and prodynorphin  <cit> . investigation of methamphetamine self-administration has shown that contingent exposure elicits different neurobiological consequences to non-contingent exposure  <cit>  and is a method with greater face validity compared with experimenter-administered models  <cit> . recently, krasnova et al. performed an extensive transcription survey in the dorsal striatum following methamphetamine self-administration for 15 h/day, in which gene expression changes persisted for up to 1 month of abstinence  <cit> . previously, short access methamphetamine self-administration has been shown to transiently reduce dopamine d <dig> receptor expression in the ventral tegmental area  using in vitro quantitative autoradiography following 24 h abstinence  <cit> , and to elicit a sensitized dopamine and glutamate response in the nucleus accumbens  following a 2 mg/kg challenge injection of methamphetamine  <cit> . this suggests that short-access models can be used to study neuroadaptations in the absence of dopaminergic neurotoxicity.

micro-rna  are ~ <dig> nucleotide rna molecules that act to regulate the expression of mrna, by binding to their 3′ untranslated region ; this leads to translational inhibition or transcriptional repression  <cit> . in the brain, enriched mirna appear to target genes with increased and/or tissue-specific expression, and are thought to act to subtly modulate gene expression networks regulated by many factors including transcriptional activators  <cit> . mirnas have a significant role in modulating the effects of drugs of abuse including cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, and opioids within brain reward circuitry  <cit> . they are involved in the development of synaptic connections and plasticity, direct dendrite formation in neurons  <cit> , and have an important role in the development of addiction-related behaviors  <cit> . the vta contains dopaminergic cell soma and innervates other brain regions, including the nac and prefrontal cortex  <cit> , which are the primary regions of methamphetamine’s pharmacological effects  <cit> . vta neurons have a role in reward and drug reinforcement  <cit>  and drug-seeking  <cit>  and as such this is an important brain region to study for persistent changes following drug administration. therefore, given the importance of the vta in addiction, the potential relevance of the rat drug self-administration model to human drug-taking patterns, the importance of gene expression changes in addiction and the dearth of such rna data for the vta, we sought to study mirna and mrna expression in the vta using a methamphetamine self-administration model followed by 14 days of abstinence.

RESULTS

mrna expression/stability can be regulated by mirnas. therefore we interrogated the 3′utr of differentially-expressed mrna for putative mirna binding sites and investigated whether any of these mirna were differentially expressed in our analyses. this revealed  <dig> transcripts which were up-regulated in comparison to a downregulation of their respective putative target mirna . in addition, we performed mirna enrichment analyses for the  <dig> differentially expressed mrna . of these, two  that were identified as significantly enriched, were also significantly differentially-expressed in the mirna microarray results.table  <dig> significantly enriched mirna using the mrna dataset

discussion
we report the first combined mrna and mirna profiling of the vta following methamphetamine self-administration and abstinence compared with drug naïve rats, using microarrays to identify significant changes in the level of  <dig> mrna transcripts and  <dig> mirnas. methamphetamine is suggested to be either neurotoxic or neuroadaptive to neurons depending on the dose administered  <cit> . our study sought to identify neuroadaptations associated with chronic low-dose methamphetamine by using a 2 h short-access model to identify persistent gene expression changes. the self-administration model is a well-established drug addiction model  <cit> , provides greater face validity to human drug intake and provides a number of benefits for future gene expression studies; notably, gene expression patterns can be studied within the scope of behavioral correlates of human addiction, for example, reinstatement, relapse and escalation of intake. this study aimed to use self-administration to determine it’s suitability for the detection of long lasting gene expression changes in a small brain region. long lasting gene expression changes in the vta have been purported to be important in the addiction process  <cit>  and the effects of methamphetamine has not been studied in as much detail in the vta as in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens, areas of it’s primary pharmacologic effect. our observations of differential mrna expression suggest that the vta plays an important role in response to long-term methamphetamine exposure, identifying many genes with known and potential roles in addiction.

we identified upregulation of mrna expression for dat and ret , two genes with established roles in regulating dopamine levels in the vta  <cit> . dat is the primary substrate of methamphetamine and inhibition or knockout of dat prevents the pharmacological effects of methamphetamine . methamphetamine can induce changes in dat function and expression within the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens  <cit>  and thus affect drug-taking behavior. unfortunately, protein samples were not available to us, but it will be important to determine whether these mrna expression changes relate to differences at the protein level in future studies. in addition, our pathways analysis highlighted important dopaminergic cell markers such as th and nurr <dig> , as well as a specific midbrain microrna, mir-133b  <cit> . further pathways analysis indicated enrichment for targets of two transcription factors, creb and c-myc, which both have identified roles in addiction   <cit> . increased phospho-creb enrichment was reported on promoter regions of addiction-associated genes c-fos, fosb, bdnf and synaptophysin in the striatum following methamphetamine self-administration  <cit> . synaptic activity leads to a prolonged phosphorylation of creb, and multiple drugs of abuse lead to increased pcreb in the dstr and nac, including cocaine  <cit> . our results suggest that creb and c-myc may have a role during abstinence, providing a possible mechanism for long term transcriptional changes following repeated drug exposure.

we observed differential mrna expression of a number of other genes with known or putative roles in brain biology/addiction, but not previously reported for methamphetamine exposure: slc47a <dig> which is a multi-drug and toxin extrusion transporter that removes organic cations and interacts with organic cation transporters  <cit> ; slc9a <dig>  which has a role in neurological disease and axon and dendrite branching  <cit> , and netrin- <dig> which is involved in axon guidance and is important in both brain development and adult brain function. as the netrin- <dig> receptor is upregulated in the vta with repeated amphetamine exposure  <cit>  it is possible that perturbations of netrin- <dig> may regulate vulnerability to relapse.

pathways analysis of the 48/ <dig> differentially expressed transcripts that were annotated revealed that proteins encoded by 18/ <dig> were co-expressed or co-localized , providing strong evidence for the potential relevance of this study to addiction biology. a number of these were cell surface receptors previously shown to be involved in drug addiction. the tachykinin receptor , has a role in reinforcement processes, and cocaine conditioned place preference can decrease methylation in the promoter region of this receptor  <cit> . thus, future work investigating changes of methylation in the tacr <dig> promoter in response to methamphetamine is warranted. single nucleotide polymorphisms in tacr <dig> have been associated with alcohol and cocaine dependence in humans  <cit> , and thus genetic variation may also play a role in methamphetamine addiction. nicotinic cholinergic receptor  is a subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed in the vta and substantia nigra, has a role in both nicotine and alcohol administration  <cit>  and influences dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum and nac  <cit> . thus, our observation of chrna <dig> upregulation may be indicative of changes to dopaminergic systems following repeated methamphetamine exposure. in addition, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein  is expressed in the brain and has a role in mrna maturation and lin7a is a scaffold protein involved in neurite extension and filopodia formation in neurons  <cit> . analyses of the  <dig> differentially expressed and annotated mrna revealed genes with both known and previously unreported roles in addiction . future analysis of the  <dig> unannotated transcripts may provide further biological insights.

the expression of mirna is high in the central nervous system, which may indicate a particular importance for mirna in this area of the body  <cit> . however, the study of mirna within the brain following exposure to drugs of abuse is still a new field, with little known about the effects of drug exposure on global mirna expression. we observed  <dig> mirna with significant differential levels in the vta between methamphetamine self-administration and drug naïve rats using microarray analyses. strikingly, the majority of these  were downregulated on methamphetamine exposure and it is possible that methamphetamine exposure fundamentally alters the dynamics of mirna expression in the vta. although speculation, this could be due to changes in methylation, chromatin remodeling or transcription factors. given that the current model of mirna regulation is transcriptional degradation or translational inhibition, it is possible that downregulation of mirna removes a constitutive repression of genes that are important for conditions in the brain that maintain addiction-type behaviors. the increased expression of such genes may then be the important factor underlying the persistence of drug addiction even after long periods of abstinence. further studies are required to investigate these possibilities and confirm changes in mirna expression.

upregulation of mir-181a following amphetamine exposure has been reported in the ventral midbrain  <cit> , consistent with our observation of increased expression of the precursor transcript on methamphetamine self-administration. in the dorsal striatum, mir- <dig> influences cocaine addiction behaviors  <cit> . we observed a trend towards downregulation of mir- <dig> in the vta on methamphetamine self-administration . we were interested to observe the higher variability of mir- <dig> and mature mir-181a  on methamphetamine self-administration compared to drug naïve controls ; this may be indicative of a dysregulation following methamphetamine exposure and warrants further investigation. in addition, we observed reduced expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expression consistent with that observed on ethanol exposure  <cit> .

mirna bind to target region in the 3′utr of mrna, and regulate mrna expression via translational inhibition or transcriptional repression  <cit> . we identified mrna with target sites in their 3′utr for differentially-expressed mirna and observed that 12/ <dig> significantly upregulated mrna contained such sites for mirna downregulated in our parallel analyses . for example, a significant decrease in mir-125a-5p was seen following methamphetamine administration along with increased ret mrna expression, one of its purported targets. mir-125a-5p has not previously been implicated in addiction. pathways analysis of the  <dig> differentially-expressed and annotated mrna showed enrichment for two mirna which were significantly downregulated in the array analyses . mir- <dig> has been linked to nicotine and ethanol exposure  <cit> ; however, dysregulation of mir- <dig> has not previously been reported after administration of any drug of addiction. validation experiments using qrtpcr showed a trend for mirna-125a-5p and mir- <dig> in a consistent direction to the array data, however, this did not reach statistical significance. we suspect that this is due to the small sample size used for this complex self-administration experiment. future experiments which knock-down specific mirna of interest and investigate subsequent changes of the target mrna and protein level will yield insights into the biological significance of our observations.

a number of the genes identified as part of the protein–protein interaction network  are also potentially regulated by differentially-expressed mirna in this study. for instance, we observed a decrease in the levels of  <dig> mirna with predicted target sites in the foxa <dig> 3′utr  along with increased foxa <dig> mrna expression on methamphetamine exposure. foxa <dig> is a member of the forkhead box family, is a marker for dopaminergic neurons, regulates dopamine neuron development in the midbrain  <cit> , and is linked to the maintenance of the dopaminergic neuron phenotype  <cit> . therefore, foxa <dig> may represent a previously unrecognized mediator of methamphetamine effects, and further study of foxa <dig> regulation of dopaminergic cells within the vta as a modulator of persistent molecular changes in abstinence is warranted. a main feature of drug addiction is relapse months or years after last exposure to drug; therefore, alterations to transcription factors may be an important way for this addiction potential to be maintained.

recent research implicates epigenetics as a mechanism for persistent gene expression changes due to repeated exposure to drugs of abuse  <cit> . we observed differential regulation of multiple transcripts related to epigenetic mechanisms and it is possible that these mechanisms hold the key to persistent changes. it is also possible that the general downregulation of mirna we observed is modulated by these epigenetic mechanisms. dna methylation, histone modification and mirna all play a role in epigenetic regulation. methamphetamine has previously been shown to increase mrna expression of dna methyltransferase  <dig>   <cit> . our study identified significant upregulation of a transcript annotated as “similar to dna methyltransferase 3b ”, which overlaps the dna methyltransferase 3b gene  and appears to contain an identical 3′utr. in addition,  <dig> mirna downregulated in our analyses  are predicted to bind 3′utr of dnmt3b, with mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-29b have demonstrated to directly affect dnmt3b expression  <cit> . we also identified differential expression of a number of mirnas which target histone modification enzymes; mir- <dig> suppresses histone deacetylase  <dig>   <cit> , mir- <dig> is predicted to target hdac <dig> mrna and mir- <dig> targets hdac <dig> mrna  <cit> . long-non-coding rna  are also involved in epigenetic regulation and their relevance to brain biology has recently been recognized  <cit> . on examination of the unannotated transcripts from the mrna array against rat lncrna databases  <cit>  we identified one lncrna  with less expression in methamphetamine self-administration compared to drug-naïve controls .

in human chronic users, methamphetamine administration occurs either in consistent low dose administration or cycles of high dose binges  <cit> . users that are not classed as dependent may still take methamphetamine regularly for the purposes of alertness, concentration, increased energy or as a dieting aid. despite the limitations of applying animal models to the human condition, we hypothesized that the model of self-administration we used would be potentially applicable to the human drug takers outlined above, and could thus be used to provide additional insights into this aspect of addiction biology. we believe that our identification of persistent expression changes in genes with both known and previously unknown roles in addiction and related biological pathways demonstrates the potential relevance and efficacy of this model in the study of addiction, providing a cost efficient model of drug taking. the study provides a preliminary insight into changes in the vta following methamphetamine self-administration, representing drug-taking, rather than drug addiction. a number of key targets identified potentially provide a mechanistic insight into the effects of methamphetamine in the vta and their functions can be further elucidated in experiments to relate them to the pharmacological effect of methamphetamine. future work expanding this model to include longer access, non-contingent exposure, extinction and drug challenge should provide additional understanding reflective of human addiction.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that short-access methamphetamine self-administration is a useful model to elucidate biologically meaningful changes in the brain. we observed a large number of changes in our microarray analyses to mrna and mirna levels with methamphetamine self-administration and found a strong relationship between addiction biology and the genes that were differentially-expressed, as well as clues towards the regulation of mrna by mirna. our data suggests an important role for small rna molecules in the regulation of gene expression changes in the vta and that this may well influence vulnerability to addiction.
