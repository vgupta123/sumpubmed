BACKGROUND
p. aeruginosa, a gram-negative bacterium, is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis   <cit> . in cf, p. aeruginosa is often isolated from sputum samples and exhibits a phenotype called mucoidy, which is due to overproduction of an exopolysaccharide called alginate. it is also an environmental bacterium which normally does not overproduce alginate  <cit> . the emergence of mucoid p. aeruginosa isolates in cf sputum specimens signifies the onset of chronic respiratory infections. mucoidy plays an important role in the pathogenesis of p. aeruginosa infections in cf, which includes, but is not limited to: increased resistance to antibiotics  <cit> , increased resistance to phagocytic killing  <cit>  and assistance in evading the host’s immune response  <cit> .

a major pathway for the conversion to mucoidy in p. aeruginosa is dependent upon algu , an alternative sigma factor that drives transcription of algd encoding the key enzyme for alginate biosynthesis  <cit> . previous studies have shown that several genes take part in the regulation of algu activation and alginate overproduction. muca is a trans-membrane protein that negatively regulates mucoidy by acting as an anti-sigma factor via sequestering algu to the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> ; mucb and intra-membrane proteases algw, mucp and clpxp were reported to affect alginate production by affecting the stability of muca  <cit> . a small envelope protein called muce was found to be a positive regulator for mucoid conversion in p. aeruginosa strains with a wild type muca  <cit> . the mechanism for muce induced mucoidy is due to its c-terminal –wvf signal, which can activate the protease algw possibly by interaction with the pdz domain  <cit> . upon activation, algw initiates the proteolytic degradation of the periplasmic portion of muca, causing the release of algu to drive expression of the alginate biosynthetic operon  <cit> . while the function of muce as an alginate inducer was identified, its physiological role, and its role in the regulation of mucoidy in clinical isolates, remains unknown.

comparative analysis through basic local alignment search tool  using the genomes of pseudomonas species from the public databases reveals that muce orthologues are found only in the strains of p. aeruginosa <cit> . in order to study the role and regulation of muce in p. aeruginosa, we first mapped the muce transcriptional start site. we then examined the effect of five different sigma factors on the expression of muce in vivo. different cell wall stress agents were tested for the induction of muce transcription. expression of muce was also analyzed in non-mucoid cf isolates to determine its ability to induce alginate overproduction.

methods
bacteria strains, plasmids, and growth conditions
bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  e. coli strains were grown at 37°c in luria broth  or lb agar. p. aeruginosa strains were grown at 37°c in lb or on pseudomonas isolation agar  plates . when required, carbenicillin, tetracycline or gentamicin were added to the growth media. the concentration of carbenicillin, tetracycline or gentamycin was added at the following concentrations: for lb broth or plates  <dig> μg ml- <dig>   <dig> μg ml- <dig> or  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  respectively. the concentration of carbenicillin, tetracycline or gentamycin to the pia plates was  <dig> μg ml- <dig>   <dig> μg ml- <dig> or  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  respectively.

the muce primer extension assay
total rna was isolated from p. aeruginosa pao <dig> grown to an od <dig> of  <dig>  in  <dig> ml lb at 37°c as previously described  <cit> . the total rna was isolated using the rneasy kit  per the manufacturer’s instructions. primers for muce , seq  <dig>  and seq  <dig> , were radio-labeled using t <dig> polynucleotide kinase  and γp32-atp. primer extensions were performed using the thermoscript rt-pcr system  with either pa <dig> seq  <dig> or seq  <dig> with 10– <dig> μg of total rna. extensions were performed at 55°c for an hour. primer extension products then were electrophoresed through a 6% acrylamide/8m urea gel along with sequencing reactions  using the same primers used in the extension reactions.

transformation and conjugation
e. coli one shot top <dig> cells  were transformed via standard heat shock method according to the supplier’s instructions. plasmid transfer from e. coli to pseudomonas was performed via triparental conjugations using the helper plasmid prk <dig>  <cit> .

generating pao <dig> minictx-pmuce-lacz reporter strain
pao <dig> genomic dna was used as a template to amply  <dig> bp upstream of the start site  of muce using two primers with built-in restriction sites, hindiii-muce-p-f  and ecori-muce-p-r: . the pmuce amplicon was topo cloned and digested with hindiii and ecori restriction enzymes before ligating into the promoterless pseudomonas integration vector minictx-lacz. the promoter fusion construct minictx-pmuce-lacz was integrated onto the p. aeruginosa chromosome of strain pao <dig> at the ctx phage att site  <cit>  following triparental conjugation with e. coli containing the prk <dig> helper plasmid  <cit> .

screening for a panel of chemical agents that can promote pmuce transcription
membrane disrupters and antibiotics were first tested by serial dilution to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration  for strain pao1::attb::pmuce-lacz. an arbitrary sub-mic concentration for each compound was then tested for the induction effect through the color change of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside ). the final concentration of the compounds used in this study are listed as follows: triclosan  <dig> μg/ml, tween- <dig>  <dig> % , hydrogen peroxide  <dig> %, sodium hypochlorite  <dig> %, sds  <dig> %, ceftazidimine  <dig>  μg/ml, tobramycin  <dig>  μg/ml, gentamicin  <dig>  μg/ml, colisitin  <dig>  μg/ml, and amikacin  <dig>  μg/ml. pao1::attb::pmuce-lacz was cultured overnight in  <dig> ml lb broth,  <dig> μl of overnight culture and  <dig> μl of 4% x-gal was added to each treatment culture tube . the cultures were grown overnight at 37°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm and were used to visually observe the change of the color. lb broth lacking x-gal was used as a negative control.

the β-galactosidase activity assay
pseudomonas strains were cultured at 37°c on three pia plates. after  <dig> hours, bacterial cells were harvested and re-suspended in pbs. the od <dig> was measured and adjusted to approximately  <dig> . cells were then permeabilized using toluene, and β-galactosidase activity was measured at od <dig> and od <dig>  the results in miller units were calculated according to this formula: miller units = 1000 × /  <cit> . the reported values represent an average of three independent experiments with standard error.

alginate assay
p. aeruginosa strains were grown at 37°c on pia plates in triplicate for  <dig> hrs or  <dig> hrs. the bacteria were collected and re-suspended in pbs. the od <dig> was analyzed for the amount of uronic acid in comparison with a standard curve made with d-mannuronic acid lactone , as previously described  <cit> .

itraq® maldi tof/tof proteome analysis
strains pao <dig>  ve <dig> and ve2Δalgu were cultured on pia plates for  <dig> hrs at 37°c. protein preparation and itraq mass spectrometry analysis was performed according to previously described methods  <cit> .

RESULTS
mapping of the muce promoter in pao1
we previously identified muce, a small envelope protein, which induces mucoid conversion in p. aeruginosa when overexpressed  <cit> . induction of muce activates the intramembrane protease algw resulting in activation of the cytoplasmic sigma factor algu and conversion from nonmucoidy to mucoidy in strains with a wild type muca  <cit> . stable production of copious amounts of alginate is characteristic of strain ve <dig> which carries a mariner transposon insertion before muce <cit> . this insertion is likely responsible for the constitutive expression of the muce gene  <cit> . however, it is unclear how muce is naturally expressed in parent pao <dig>  to determine this, primer extension analysis of the muce promoter region was performed. with higher amounts of pao <dig> rna , we observed one prominent transcriptional start site that is initiated  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the muce translational start site . this suggests that, under these conditions, muce has one promoter that is active in pao <dig> 

the alternative sigma factor algu activates transcription of muce in vivo
in order to determine which sigma factor is responsible for driving muce transcription, minictx-pmuce-lacz was integrated onto the pao <dig> chromosome. to identify the sigma factor that activates the expression of pmuce, we expressed p. aeruginosa sigma factors  in trans and measured pmuce-lacz activity in this pao <dig> fusion strain. as seen in figure  <dig>  miller assay results showed that algu significantly increased the promoter activity of pmuce in pao <dig>  however, we did not observe any significant increases in promoter activity of pmuce with other sigma factors tested in this study. as stated earlier, algu is a sigma factor that controls the promoter of the alginate biosynthetic gene algd <cit> . in order to determine whether the activity of pmuce is elevated in mucoid strains, plp170-pmuce was conjugated into mucoid laboratory and clinical p. aeruginosa strains. as seen in figures 3a and 3b, the activity of pmuce increased in mucoid laboratory and cf isolates.

cell wall stress promotes expression of muce from pmuce
since the muce promoter was active in nonmucoid pao <dig> and further increased in mucoid cells , the conditions that induce muce expression were examined. to do this, we used the same pmuce-lacz strain of pao <dig> to measure the activation of muce by some compounds previously shown to cause cell wall perturbations  <cit> . the phenotypes of strains harboring the pmuce-lacz fusion in the presence of various cell wall stress agents are shown in figure 4a. while sodium hypochlorite and colistin didn’t induce a visual change in pmuce activity, three compounds, triclosan, sodium dodecyl sulfate  and ceftazidime induced marked expression of pmuce-lacz in pao <dig>  each resulted in elevated levels of β-galactosidase activity as indicated by the blue color of the growth media. this suggests that the pmuce promoter activity was increased in response to these stimuli . miller assays were performed to measure the changes in pmuce-lacz activity due to these compounds. triclosan increased pmuce-lacz activity by almost 3-fold over lb alone . an increase in pmuce-lacz should increase palgu-lacz activity. as expected, triclosan caused a 5-fold increase in palgu-lacz activity. however, sds and ceftazidime increased the pmuce-lacz activity, but did not promote the palgu-lacz activity .

alginate production is reduced in the muce mutant compared to pao1
expression of muce can cause alginate overproduction  <cit> . however, we wondered if muce would affect transcriptional activity at palgu and palgd promoters. in order to determine this, both plp170-palgu and plp170-palgd with each promoter fused to a promoterless lacz gene were conjugated into pao <dig> and pao1ve <dig>  respectively. as seen in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the activity of palgu  and palgd  was significantly increased in the muce over-expressed strain pao1ve <dig>  although, qiu et al.  <cit>  have reported that algu is required for muce induced mucoidy, we wanted to know whether muce is required for algu induced mucoidy. as seen in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we did not observe that the over-expression of muce induced mucoidy in pao1Δalgu. this result is consistent with what was previously reported by qiu et al. <cit> . however, the alginate production induced by algu was decreased in the muce knockout strain. the alginate production induced by algu in two isogenic strains, pao <dig> and pao1muce::isphoa/hah is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml/od <dig>  respectively . these results indicate that alginate overproduction in pao <dig> does not require muce. however, muce can promote the activity of algu resulting in a higher level of alginate production in pao <dig> compared to the muce knockout. previously, boucher et al. <cit>  and suh et al. <cit>  have reported that sigma factors rpon and rpos were involved in alginate regulation. in order to determine whether muce induced mucoidy was also dependent on other sigma factors besides algu, pherd20t-muce was conjugated and over-expressed in pao1Δrpon, pao1rpos::islacz/hah and pao1rpof::isphoa/hah. the results showed that the muce induction caused mucoid conversion in pao1rpos::islacz/hah and pao1rpof::isphoa/hah when  <dig> % l-arabinose was added to the media. however,  <dig> % l-arabinose was required for mucoid conversion in pao1Δrpon. the alginate production induced by muce in pao1rpos::islacz/hah, pao1rpof::isphoa/hah and pao1Δrpon is  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml/od <dig>  respectively. these results suggested that rpon, rpos and rpof are not required for muce-induced mucoidy in pao <dig>  conversely, over-expression of these sigma factors rpod, rpon, rpos and rpof did not induce mucoid conversion in pao <dig>  when the strains of pao <dig> with sigma factor overexpression were measured for alginate production, the level is as follows:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   μg/ml/od <dig> 

muce-induced mucoidy in clinical cf isolates is based on two factors, size of muca and genotype of algu
although, qiu et al.  <cit>  have reported that over-expression of muce can induce mucoidy in laboratory strains pao <dig> and pa <dig>  its ability to induce mucoidy in clinical cf isolates has not been investigated. particularly, muce’s relationship to muca mutations is unknown since different mutations would result in production of muca with various molecular masses. to test if the length of muca had an effect on muce-mediated mucoid induction, we selected a group of nonmucoid clinical isolates and observed any phenotypic change after overexpression of muce. figure  <dig> summarizes the results. first, strains with wild type algu and muca became mucoid. although, muca of cf <dig> carries a missense mutation, cf <dig> became mucoid. secondly, as seen in figure  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>  muce could induce mucoidy in cf <dig>  and cf <dig>  with wild type algu, but not in strains containing algu carrying a missense mutation . thirdly, overexpression of muce did not induce mucoidy in cf <dig> and cf <dig>  whose muca length was 117aa, despite a wild type algu in cf <dig>  these results suggest that muce-mediated mucoidy is dependent on the combination of two factors, muca length and algu genotype . the effect of muce on mucoid induction is more obvious in strains with muca length up to  <dig> amino acid residues coupled with wild type algu, but missense mutations in algu can significantly reduce the potency of muce.

mutant algus display partial activity resulting in decreased amount of alginate
schurr et al. have reported that second-site suppressor mutations in algu can affect mucoidy  <cit> . devries and ohman  <cit>  also reported that mucoid-to-nonmucoid conversion in alginate-producing p. aeruginosa is often due to spontaneous mutations in algt . recently, damkiaer et al.  <cit>  showed that point mutations can result in a partially active algu. to test whether the activity of algu from different cf isolates is affected due to mutation, the cf <dig> and cf <dig> algu genes were cloned and over-expressed in pao1Δalgu and pao1minictx-palgd-lacz, respectively. as seen in figure  <dig>  these constructs retained the ability to promote the transcription of palgd and alginate production. also, when transposon libraries were screened for mucoid revertants in cf <dig>  <cit>  and frd <dig>  three and five mucoid mutants in cf <dig> and frd <dig>  respectively, were identified due to transposon insertion before algu causing the overexpression of algu . however, the activity of the mutant algu is lower than that of wild type algu . in order to determine whether the mutant algu still has the ability to promote muce transcription, algu genes from cf <dig> and cf <dig> were cloned into pherd20t, respectively, and over-expressed in pao <dig> minictx-pmuce-lacz strain. as seen in figure  <dig>  mutant forms of algu were still able to promote muce transcription, albeit at a reduced level.

characterization of the muce regulon using itraq analysis
in order to determine the effect of muce expression on the proteome change, we performed itraq proteome analysis via maldi tof/tof. total protein lysates of pao <dig>  ve <dig>  and ve2Δalgu  were collected and analyzed. within the three samples,  <dig> unique proteins were identified with  <dig> peptides assayed at/or above 95% confidence. the data set was then filtered to include only proteins that were significantly different between samples and the number of the detected peptides for each protein more than three . by comparing the proteomes of ve <dig> to pao <dig>  the effects of increased muce levels on pao <dig> were examined; while comparing ve2Δalgu to pao <dig> allowed for the determination of algu-independent protein production in ve <dig>  as seen in additional file 1: table s <dig>  compared to pao <dig>   <dig> proteins were differentially expressed due to muce over-expression, and two of them  are algu-independent.

discussion
muce is a small envelope protein whose overexpression can promote alginate overproduction in p. aeruginosa strains with a wild type muca  <cit> . here, we observed that algu can induce the expression from pmuce, and consistent with this result, the pmuce activity is higher in mucoid strains than in non-mucoid strains . algu is a stress-related alternate sigma factor that is auto-regulated from its multiple promoters  <cit> . as a sigma factor, algu drives transcription of the alginate biosynthetic gene algd <cit>  and the alginate regulator gene algr <cit> . as shown in this study, algu can also activate the transcription of muce, and subsequently, depending on the level of induction, muce can increase palgu and palgd activity resulting in mucoid conversion in clinical strains. together, these results suggest a positive feedback mechanism of action in which algu activates muce expression at the pmuce promoter, and in return, the increased level of muce can increase algu activity by activating algw, which further degrades muca . this regulation between muce and algu probably ensures that a cell, upon exposure to stress, can rapidly reach the desired level of algu and alginate production. therefore, it is not surprising to see that a higher level of alginate production requires muce in p. aeruginosa strains with a wild type muca . we also noted that some cell wall stress agents, like triclosan and sds can induce the expression of muce. however, the differential activation at palgu by triclosan but not sds suggests sds may not be an inducer at palgu, and/or the stimulation by sds was not high enough to initiate the positive feedback regulation of muce by algu. nevertheless, this observation is consistent with what was previously reported by wood et al. regarding the absence of induction at palgd by sds  <cit> . furthermore, we found that strain pao <dig> does not become mucoid when cultured on lb or pia plates supplemented with triclosan or sds at the concentration as used in figure  <dig> .

qiu et al. have reported that muce can induce alginate overproduction when over-expressed in vivo <cit> . however, nothing was known about the regulation of muce. recently, the genome-wide transcriptional start sites of many genes were mapped by rna-seq in p. aeruginosa strain pa <dig>  <cit> . however, the transcriptional start site of the muce gene  was not included. in this study, we reported the mapping of the muce transcriptional start site. furthermore, we found the transcription of muce is dependent on algu. analysis of the upstream region of muce reveals an algu promoter-like sequence . previously, firoved et al. identified  <dig> genes in the algu regulon, based on scanning for algu promoter consensus sequence  in the pao <dig> genome  <cit> . in this study, we found that algu can activate the transcription of muce. in order to determine whether algu can bind to pmuce region, algu was purified  and electrophoretic mobility shift assay  was performed. as seen in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  our results showed that algu affected the mobility of pmuce dna, especially in the presence of e. coli rna polymerase core enzyme, suggesting a direct binding of algu to pmuce. however, whether small regulatory rnas or other unknown regulator proteins are also involved in the transcriptional regulation of muce needs further study. lptf is another example of an algu-dependent gene, but doesn’t have the consensus sequence in the promoter region  <cit> . while muce, as a small envelope protein is positively regulated through a feedback mechanism, it’s not clear how many algu-regulated genes follow the same pattern of regulation as muce.

the muca mutation is a major mechanism for the conversion to mucoidy. mutation can occur throughout the muca gene   <cit> . these mutations result in the generation of muca proteins of different sizes. for example, unlike the wild type muca with  <dig> amino acid residues, muca <dig>  which is produced due to a frameshift mutation, results in a protein containing the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of muca, fused with a stretch of  <dig> amino acids without homology to any known protein sequence  <cit> . muca <dig> lacks the trans-membrane domain of wild type muca, predicting a cytoplasmic localization. therefore, different muca mutations could possibly result in different cellular compartment localization. identification of muce’s function as an inducer of alginate in strains with wild type muca and algu strongly suggests muce acts through interaction with algw in the periplasm. on the other hand, the loss of this predicted muca-algw interaction can be seen in two strains, cf <dig> and cf <dig>  which lack the major cleavage site of algw  <cit>  . interestingly, we observed that the missense mutation in algu can reduce, but not completely abolish, the activity of algu as an activator for alginate production. this data may explain why mutant algu alleles have reduced pmuce activity . furthermore, since algu is an auto-regulated protein  <cit> , this may explain why the pmuce activity induced by mutant algu is lower than that of wild type algu. a slightly higher activity of pmuce noted in cf <dig> than in pao1ve <dig>  could be due to a combined effect of dual mutation of algu and muca in cf <dig>  in strains of frd <dig> and cf <dig>  the retention of the algw cleavage site is not sufficient to restore mucoidy. this is because of the partial function of algu, which can be seen with alginate production and algu-dependent palgd promoter activity . altogether, these results suggest that mucoidy in clinical isolates can be modulated by a combination of two factors, the size of the muca protein and the genotype of the algu allele in a particular strain. muca size determines its cellular localization and its ability to sequester algu, and the algu allele determines whether algu is fully or partially active.

the itraq results showed that the expression of two proteins was significantly increased and the expression of nine proteins was decreased in the muce over-expressed strain ve <dig> . of these  <dig> proteins, nine of them are algu dependent, for including flagellin type b. garrett et al. previously reported that algu can negatively regulate flagellin type b and repress flagella expression  <cit> . however, no algu consensus promoter sequences were found within the upstream of the  <dig> regulated genes through bioinformatics analysis, indicating that these may be indirect effect. in addition, two proteins  were significantly decreased when compared to pao <dig> proteome, but remained unchanged when comparison was made between ve <dig> and ve2Δalgu, suggesting the reduction of these two proteins was independent of algu in the muce over-expressed strain. mvat is a global regulator of virulence in p. aeruginosa <cit> , and elongation factor tu is important for growth and translation. elongation factor tu has also been shown to act as a chaperone in e. coli, consistent with induction of proteins involved in responding to heat or other protein damaging stresses  <cit> . recently, elongation factor tu has been shown to have a unique post-translational modification that has roles in colonization of the respiratory tract  <cit> . the differential expression of tu due to muce overexpression suggests there may be signaling networks dependent upon muce that we have not yet been identified. although, previous studies have shown that the growth rate is slower in mucoid strains and the virulence is increased after deleting algu  <cit> , the relationship between muce and growth or virulence need further study. together, itraq analysis suggests that muce signaling affected both algu-dependent and algu-independent protein expression.

CONCLUSIONS
the alternative sigma factor algu was responsible for muce transcription. together, our results suggest there is a positive feedback regulation of muce by algu in p. aeruginosa, and the expression of muce can be induced by exposure to certain cell wall stress agents, suggesting that muce may be part of the signal transduction that senses the cell wall stress to p. aeruginosa.
