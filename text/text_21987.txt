BACKGROUND
hd is a dominant genetic disorder caused by pathologic expansion of a polyglutamine  repeat in exon one of the it <dig> gene encoding htt. the hallmark of hd is neurodegeneration and formation of mutant htt protein aggregates, predominantly in the striatum and cerebral cortex  <cit> . the polyq repeat length influences the age of onset and the overall level of function, and can be correlated with the severity of the disease  <cit> . however, it has been suggested that cag length accounted for 40% of the variability in the age of onset  <cit> , thus there are other factors which contribute to the age of onset. the phenotype of the disease is demonstrated through three categories of abnormalities: cognitive, psychological, and motor. studies have suggested that cognitive deficits often emerge as the first symptom of disease onset, specifically seen in speech delay in juvenile hd patients  <cit> . approximately 44% of hd patients experiencing some general cognitive impairment reportedly struggle with memory retrieval  <cit> . the psychiatric disorders common to hd include aggression, affective disorders, irritability, obsession-like symptoms and behavioral and personality disorders  <cit> .

the average age of onset for hd is 37–38 years  <cit>  and the median life expectancy after disease onset is  <dig>  years , with the median being similar regardless of age of onset  <cit> . many patients have children before discovering they have the disease. although there is a single causal genetic mutation in hd with very high penetrance, effective therapeutics to treat disease symptoms remain elusive. large sequencing or microarray profiling studies of the “transcriptome”  are beginning to facilitate identification of potential new therapeutic targets in hd; however, extensive research is required as humans generate thousands of transcripts.

there are reports of rna analysis from a range of biological tissues types as well as from various model systems with hd, including humans and rodents  <cit>  transcript expression has been assessed from distinct brain regions of hd patients  <cit> , which is refining our understanding of the molecular alterations with disease progression. although the brain is a primary pathogenic target in hd, peripheral tissue damage is also prevalent. studies from peripheral cells which can non-invasively be collected, such as blood, are ideal for longitudinal correlation of transcriptome expression with the stages of disease. identified candidates from blood could function as putative pathogenic biomarkers or therapeutic targets in pre- and post-symptomatic patients. to date, there are limited reports of rna analysis from peripheral blood in hd, however, a few laboratories have profiled mrna alterations from total blood as well as isolated lymphocytes  <cit> . the list of validated targets from the blood cell studies are not expansive and are cross-sectional analyses from only one species, humans.

here, we propose to elucidate the longitudinal transcriptomic patterns in peripheral blood of transgenic hd monkeys, an animal model which has a long lifespan of many years and are amenable to routine blood collection  <cit> . previous reports from our group have shown the hd monkeys uniquely exhibit some symptoms consistent with those exhibited in human patients  <cit> . we developed a group of hd monkeys which express a fragment of the human htt gene with a range of polyq repeats greater than the 10– <dig> polyq repeats that are normally present in wild-type rhesus macaque. as rhesus macaque endogenously express 10-11q, the pathogenic threshold of polyq repeats in monkeys is expected to be lower compared to 35– <dig> polyq repeats in healthy human populations  <cit> . biological samples are collected on a routine and scheduled basis throughout the lifespan of each animal. we profiled the transcriptome of the monkeys from peripheral blood and identified mrnas associated with hd during the first two-years of their development, a timespan which encompasses the onset of hd phenotype. we further monitored a select group of candidates, based on their apparent corresponding dysregulation reported in human hd patient blood, for an additional year. collectively, this study begins to map the molecular dynamics that occur during the course of hd pathogenesis and identify transcriptomic targets with distinct disease trends.

RESULTS
generation of hd transgenic monkeys
transgenic rhesus macaques were created to overexpress exon  <dig>   <cit>  or a larger fragment containing exons 1– <dig> of the human htt gene , under the control of the human polyubiquitin-c  or human htt promoter respectively, with different number of polyq repeats . rhd <dig> expresses a 29q repeat, and rhd <dig>  rhd <dig>  and rhd <dig> express 67q, 70q, and 72q respectively . all hd monkeys carry htt with expanded polyq repeats, based on normal wild-type rhesus macaque carry 10– <dig> polyq repeats , which parallels the genetic anomalies observed in human patients  <cit>  . integrated polyq repeat number varies among the hd monkeys, which may be due to the inherent instability of expanded polyq sequences that has been extensively studied  <cit> . the ubc promoter permits more ubiquitous expression of the transgene  <cit> , whereas the htt promoter enables similar tissue-related expression patterns as the endogenous htt transcript  <cit> . indeed, the endogenous htt is not highly expressed in peripheral blood  <cit> , paralleling the lower levels of the transgene htt mrna levels we observed in rhd <dig>  rhd <dig> and rhd <dig> compared to rhd <dig>  which is regulated by the ubc promoter . based on our preliminary analysis of rhd <dig> in its first 24 months of life, including imaging findings, cognitive behavioral decline symptoms, and several episodes of seizures at a young age , this particular animal may parallel human juvenile onset hd . on the other hand, the other three hd monkeys that carry a larger htt fragment driven by the human htt promoter seem to have a slower rate in progression without the development of seizures; thus, these hd monkeys may more closely resemble adult onset hd. we developed an hd primate model rating scale  <cit> , which is modified from the unified huntington's disease rating scale   <cit>  that is commonly used for monitoring progression of hd in patients. the hdpmrs is primarily focused on monitoring the progression of motor deficit while psychological behaviors such as suicidal thought and speech were excluded. all hd monkeys exhibited progressive scores compared to the control monkeys. at 12 months, there were no apparent differences between the hd and control monkeys by hdpmrs, however, at 24 months  and 37 months , the hd monkeys rated significantly above controls .

microarray profiling reveals transcriptomic dysregulation in hd monkeys
to systematically map the transcript expression patterns with hd progression, we interrogated over  <dig>  mrnas in peripheral blood samples collected from the hd monkeys and age-matched controls at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 23 months of age with rhesus macaque affymetrix arrays. spiking controls present on the arrays showed very minimal differences across all hybridizations . we selected  <dig>  out of  <dig>  rhesus affymetrix probe sets on the microarray for further analysis based on a “present” detection call from the affymetrix mas <dig> algorithm in 10% or more of the samples . two-way anova of log2-transformed probe intensities using a fixed-effect model with disease as a categorical and age as a numeric variable showed  <dig>  and  <dig>  probes with a significant  < <dig> ) disease and age effect, respectively .

significant pathway association with hd dysregulated transcripts
ingenuity analysis of the mrnas with a p disease value <  <dig>  revealed  <dig> canonical pathways significantly associated with the dysregulated hd transcripts. some of those canonical pathways have previously been linked to hd, such as pyruvate metabolism  <cit> , glycolysis/gluconeogenesis  <cit> , ngf signaling  <cit> , and nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response  <cit>  .

parallel disruption of transcript expression in hd monkey and human blood
to identify mrnas with the strongest potential for association with hd, we compared the rhesus macaque array data with array results deposited into the ncbi geo database from human blood of control and hd patients  <cit> . for further stringency in our search for hd-related transcripts, we analyzed two datasets deposited into geo from the same set of human samples which were probed separately with two independent array platforms . between the two human array datasets , we identified  <dig> mrnas with analogous patterns of disrupted transcript expression , and focused on those for further comparison with the rhesus candidates. notably,  <dig> of the  <dig> human hd transcripts were also altered in our hd monkeys .

all of the  <dig> rhesus transcripts with parallel dysregulation in human hd patients were graphed individually to assess the disease-associated trend for each gene and facilitate selection of mrnas for further investigation. we selected a subset of  <dig> genes which displayed a significant change in expression between hd and controls across the timepoints analyzed by microarray of 5–23 months by two-way anova . those same candidates were also chosen based on their corresponding dysregulation in studies from human control, presymptomatic and symptomatic hd patients   <cit> , which included; superoxide dismutase  <dig> , frizzled family receptor  <dig> , runt-related transcription factor  <dig> , nadh dehydrogenase  <dig> alpha subcomplex  <dig> , cell division cycle  <dig> homolog a , arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase , lamin a/c , latexin , axl receptor tyrosine kinase , epsin  <dig> , and tumor protein p <dig>  . among the eleven candidates with significant changes, four candidates  also displayed an age-effect in the array analysis . moreover, the  <dig> selected transcripts collectively encompass a broad range of regulatory and signaling functions, including mitochondrial and immune responses. candidates, including ndufa <dig>  alox <dig>  lxn, epn <dig>  lmna, fzd <dig>  and sod <dig> began to display altered expression with hd early in development, by 5 months of age . notably, those same candidates also exhibited an apparent trend for altered expression in presymptomatic human hd patients, suggesting those transcripts may play a role in the earlier stages of hd pathogenesis . the human study, however, is a cross-sectional analysis, therefore, a full longitudinal study will help further define the progression of molecular changes.

longitudinal transcriptomic analysis in hd monkeys by real time pcr 
to further examine transcriptome changes in the hd monkeys, we measured all  <dig> mrnas at extended timepoints of  <dig>   <dig>  and 39 months to validate the continuous longitudinal changes of the candidates . indeed,  <dig> genes  showed longitudinal statistical dysregulation by two-way anova from 5–39 months . additionally, all  <dig> genes appeared to exhibit a trend of altered expression at an early age, at least by 5 months; furthermore, ndufa <dig> showed a trend of progressive dysregulation with age. statistical comparison of the slopes for the hd and control monkeys for ndufa <dig> from  <dig> to 39 months revealed significantly different trajectories .

discussion
here we report the first longitudinal transcriptomic profiling study from an hd monkey model. hd is a highly progressive disorder  <cit> , therefore, identifying patterns in mrna expression which correspond with disease advancement will likely facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies  <cit> . distinct alterations in the hd transcriptome were discovered during the first two years of examination from peripheral blood. some of the identified genes in this study, such as ndufa <dig>  are part of the canonical hd signaling pathway   <cit> , suggesting that alterations in genes commonly associated with htt-mediated pathogenesis can be evaluated in peripheral blood. moreover, novel hd-associated mrnas, such as lxn or fzd <dig>  were also identified through the correlation of hd monkey and human profiles. interestingly, lxn was previously shown to be an important regulator of hematopoiesis  <cit> , while deficiencies in peripheral blood functions of hd patients have been widely reported, including immune responses  <cit> . furthermore, the wnt signaling cascade, which fzd <dig> is a component of, is increasingly being reported as an important regulator of the cellular responses to mhtt in hd  <cit> . transcriptome changes in human hd patients can be significantly influenced by other co-existing pathology unrelated to hd, which arguably would be a less pervasive influence in hd monkeys. it would be anticipated, however, that the primary molecular targets of mhtt would be altered in both humans and monkeys, in spite of other physiological or genetic factors which might be present and non-specific to hd. overall, our data suggests the hd monkey model may help to uncover primate-associated transcriptomic changes due to mhtt.

all five candidates we validated with disease associated trends up to 39 months of age in the hd monkeys  were dysregulated at a very young age, presumbly in the earlier stages of life based on hdpmrs, while other ongoing clinical evaluations including cognitive behavior and imaging studies will further define their phenotypes. genes with disrupted expression prior to onset of cognitive and behavioral deficits could potentially be well suited as therapeutic targets aimed to prevent development of disease symptoms. furthermore, ndufa <dig> appeared to also show a longitudinal escalation in transcript dysregulation with time and disease, suggesting it may also serve as a blood biomarker for hd progression. interestingly, very recent reports indicate the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which ndufa <dig> is part of, was functionally impaired in platelets from pre-symptomatic and symptomatic hd patients  <cit> . the upregulation of ndufa <dig> mrna expression in the peripheral blood of humans and monkeys with hd may represent a potential compensatory mechanism as pathology develops. although this study focused on samples with a mixed population of wbc in both the monkey and human analysis, a future point of interest could entail examining mrna expression patterns in distinct classes of wbc as well  <cit> . a cross-sectional study which profiled mrnas from lymphocytes has been reported   <cit> , future longitudinal studies in hd primate models focused on specific wbc cell types could help to further define the location of the molecular changes.

collectively, our data indicate that hd monkeys can be a useful resource for uncovering transcriptomic targets with correlation to disease progression. furthermore, longitudinal examination of disease-associated candidates can be monitored from the blood of hd monkeys and correlated with human hd patients for identification of causative pathogenic pathways. our results reporting consistent molecular changes between hd monkeys and human patients suggest the hd monkeys may be a potential model for future pre-clinical trials. additionally, the hd monkeys are not exposed to pharmacological agents, thus preventing a drug-based bias in the longitudinal studies.

as the hd monkeys further develop, future studies will focus on extensive molecular mapping encompassing early to late stages of hd progression and define which candidates may be optimal as biomarkers or as therapeutic targets. upcoming studies will also be able to correlate transcriptomic changes with primate-specific hd behavioral phenotypes, as well as other clinical measurements  <cit> . additionally, although the  <dig> candidates identified in this paper were significantly changed with hd by microarray and extended longitudinal analysis by qpcr, there is a possibility for gender bias due to small sample size. in the current study, there are  <dig> male hd monkeys and for the controls, there are  <dig> females and  <dig> males; thus, studies with future generations of hd monkeys can further examine any influence of gender or other factors on the candidate gene expression. recently, we reported germline transmission of the human htt transgene along with the presence of pathogenic mhtt aggregation in neurons derived from embryonic stem  cells of rhd <dig> fertilized embryo  <cit> , setting the stage for creation of the next generation of hd monkeys and corresponding studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we anticipate that on-going longitudinal studies in the current group of hd monkeys as well as future generations will lead to a defined list of transcripts strongly correlated with the progressive pathogenic stages in hd. future generations of hd monkeys can be engaged in testing of novel pharmacological treatments, offering new approaches to investigate hd.
