BACKGROUND
glaucoma comprises a group of neurodegenerative disorders of the eye characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and atrophy of the optic nerve  <cit> . with a multifactoral etiology, glaucoma account for  <dig> % blindness worldwide  <cit> . primary open angle glaucoma  is the most common form of the disease  <cit>  where the vision is lost in a progressive manner and, if untreated, results in bilateral blindness. about  <dig> million people are affected with poag  <cit> . it usually gives no indication to the patient until there is appreciable and irreversible loss of the field of vision. normal tension glaucoma , juvenile glaucoma, chronic open angle glaucoma are common subtypes of poag. so far three different genes, myocilin  and optineurin  and wdr <dig>  <cit>  and eleven additional chromosomal loci have been reported to be linked to poag  <cit> . also digenic form of the disease has been reported based on mutations in myoc and cyp1b <dig> genes  <cit> .

recent studies have implicated genes that are expressed in the optic nerve head   <cit>  and the trabecular meshwork   <cit>  to be involved in poag pathogenesis. we examined opticin  as a candidate for poag since it is expressed in the trabecular meshwork – the ocular site where the poag related pathogenesis occurs  <cit> . optc encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids and a member of class iii small leucin-rich repeat protein  family  <cit> . the gene is located on chromosome 1q31-q <dig> within an age-related macular degeneration  susceptibility locus  <cit>  and examined for nucleotide variants in both amd and poag patients  <cit> .

we, therefore, screened optc as candidate in  <dig> eastern indian poag patients to decipher the underlying complexity of the disease and attempted to broaden our understanding regarding its pathogenesis.

RESULTS
mutation and snp profile in optc
a novel change  that would result in a non-conservative substitution  was detected in exon  <dig> of optc  in a sporadic patient in heterozygous condition . the suspect allele was not detected in any of  <dig> control individuals screened for variation in the optc. in addition, the encoded amino acid residue  being affected is conserved in higher vertebrates  among all the species for which the sequence of optc homologue is available . also, a sift score of  <dig>  suggests functional relevance of the protein resulting from the variant allele . the patient  had a total loss of vision, with no pl  in the right eye and with the ability to count fingers at one-foot distance with pr  in the left eye. when we first met the patient he had already undergone trabeculectomy in his right eye and before the surgery he almost lost the vision in the right eye. he had maximum iop of  <dig> and  <dig> mm of hg in the right & the left eye, respectively. there was no previous record for iop in his right eye, and the value at post-operative stage was  <dig> mm of hg. the cup to disc ratio could not be determined in the right eye due to presence of cataract and hazy media and  <dig>  in the left eye. gonioscopy revealed open angle . this nucleotide change was not found in  <dig> healthy control samples .

the second nucleotide alteration  was identified in heterozygous condition in exon  <dig> of optc gene of a  <dig> year old male sporadic patient  who was also heterozygous for a reported mutation  in optn  <cit> . the iop of this patient, recorded in aided condition, was  <dig> &  <dig> mm of hg in the right and the left eye, respectively. the lower iop value in the left eye was due to the medication used. unlike the other variant , the amino acid residue  for the wild type allele  for this nucleotide change  is conserved only in human and mouse , and gives a non-significant  sift score . though the nucleotide change was not identified in  <dig> control individuals, it appears unlikely to be pathogenic.

both the nucleotide variants  were examined for aberrant mrna structure and splice variation, if any, using the in silico tools  but did not find any significant variation in predicted rna structure or splice alteration. patients carrying these two novel changes were sporadic in nature and their family members were not available to determine the disease status in the relatives and the segregation pattern of the variant alleles.

a reported snp  <cit>   identified in a patient  was scored in other patients and controls by bpu10i rflp assay. however, no significant difference was observed between the patients and control subjects either in allele frequencies  or genotype distribution . the heterozygosity of the snp in patient and control groups was found to be  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

functional importance of a 'silent' change in optc coding region
a novel change  in exon  <dig> of optc , that on conceptual translation would remain silent , was detected in heterozygous condition in a sporadic patient but none in  <dig> control individuals . the patient, a  <dig> year old male patient  with unilateral glaucoma in the right eye, presented with a visual acuity of 6/ <dig> , iop of  <dig> mm of hg and a cup to disc ratio of  <dig> . gonioscopy revealed open angle  and a mature and complicated cataract in the right eye. the visual field analysis in the right eye showed localized defect near fixation point in the infero-temporal quadrant and tubular vision. he was under anti-glaucoma medication in the right eye. the left eye was traumatic with a history of penetrating injury at ages of  <dig> and  <dig> years. there was no perception of light on projection in the left eye. incidentally younger brother  of the proband  is also heterozygous for the 'silent' change  who was a 'suspect' for poag with raised iop but no significant c:d ratio or visual field change. however, this individual later did not come for follow up and could not be traced despite best efforts.  no splice alteration was predicted to be caused by the variant allele as determined by in silico analysis using ese finder and resque ese.

interestingly, though the variant nucleotide is the third base of the codon and prone to wobble, at mrna level, it is evolutionarily conserved in all higher vertebrates among the species for which the sequence of optc homologue is available . there are two codons  for phe that, as per latest ncbi data have no significant difference in the relative usage in human proteins . this provoked us to look for the stability of this variant at mrna level using rnadraw. we observed that though the variation of structure energy  between variant  and normal optc mrna  did not appear to be significant enough affecting stability of the variant, a large change in the secondary structure of mrna was apparent . we reasoned that an altered structure of the mrna, if any, might influence the efficiency of translation of the transcript due to a single nucleotide change . in the ncbi snp database we found another silent change   <dig> bp upstream but not in the close proximity of the silent change  under investigation. the 5' silent snp  was tested for change in the mrna secondary structures between the two alleles and no significant variation was observed. to find out its downstream implication, the variant  was created by site directed mutagenesis in the opticin cdna cloned in pegfpn <dig> and subsequently transfected both wild type  and variant  in the retinal pigment epithelium  cells. transfection experiments were done in  <dig> to  <dig> times followed by subsequent quantitative rt-pcr  and western blot analysis. from the qrt data it was evident that the mrna amount of the silent variant  was lower  with respect to wild type  . further, western blot analysis using anti-opticin antibody clearly showed that expression of the mutant protein  was lower  compared to the native protein  . both the gfp fused proteins were normalized with the endogenous opticin in rpe cells.

discussion
the complex nature of poag warrants identification of genes that are expressed in the tm tissues, retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve head in order to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to the disease pathogenesis. recent studies in this direction have identified genes that could be potentially involved in the disease pathology  <cit> . among these candidate genes, myocilin mutations account for about 3–4% of open angle glaucoma   <cit> , with the gln368stop nonsense variant accounting for many, but not all, of the adult onset oag cases  <cit> . most of the other myoc variants are missense mutations usually associated with a joag phenotype. a small number of mutations in optineurin are found in families in which most affected individuals have ntg  <cit> . mutations in wdr <dig> have been observed to be mostly associated with adult poag patients with high levels of iop  <cit> . much remains to be understood about the underlying mechanisms by which mutations in these genes predispose to glaucoma and most cases cannot be accounted for by these three genes. in a previous study, optc was examined in  <dig> patients with ocular problem:  <dig> with age-related macular degeneration ,  <dig> with amd plus poag or ntg, and  <dig> individuals with poag or ntg alone  <cit> – this screening effort yielded four sequence variations. on screening of the gene in  <dig> poag patients of eastern india, we detected two nucleotide variants with potential to be causal to the pathogenesis for the disease, a rare variant and a snp. the two novel, missense variants were absent in  <dig> controls suggesting potential role of the variant alleles in poag. while our study suggests involvement of optc in causation of poag, we could not directly implicate the gene for lack of current knowledge on its biological function.

a translationally silent variation  present in optc of a poag patient but none of the controls suggested potential biological relevance of apparently innocuous change. though in silico analysis does not suggest alteration of splice site resulting from the nucleotide change, wet lab experiments including construction of minigene and its analysis by transcription is necessary for a final answer. although, mrna secondary structure prediction analysis did not show a large alteration of stability as measured by change in the structure energy, the structural alteration appeared to be impressive. but a clear observation based on the loop structure and its stability is not apparent to offer further explanation. however, the influence of rna secondary structure on gene expression and pattern of interaction has been already reported in prokaryotic system  <cit>  and hiv  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the lower translational efficiency of the mutant allele might be due to lower stability of the mutant mrna or, in a less likely situation, structural hindrance in translation. the qrt data demonstrates lower amount of mutant mrna available for translation. the variation in the stability of the wildtype and mutant mrna could be measured by limited rnase digestion or in vitro transcription techniques. it is worthwhile to mention here that it remains important to show functional correlation of the suspected opticin variants with glaucoma pathogenesis to further substantiate role of the gene in the disease process.

a direct correlation of the optc silent change, described in this article, with poag would require demonstration of either cosegregation of the variant allele with poag in a family or identification of the nucleotide change in multiple unrelated patients. presence of the 'functional silent variation'  in the poag 'suspect' younger sib of the patient, however, supports further of its potential association with poag.

CONCLUSIONS
we detected two novel missense alterations along with a 'silent' change in optc; among these p.glu66gly and the silent change  are likely to be associated with glaucomatous phenotype. the expression of the protein from the rare allele  of the 'silent' change  was significantly lower. therefore, our study highlights the importance of investigating the 'silent' mutations for functional implication that might not be apparent from only in silico analysis. additional studies on role of optc in poag would provide better understanding of the function of the gene in the poag related pathogenesis.
