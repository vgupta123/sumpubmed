BACKGROUND
malaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world with the most lethal form, plasmodium falciparum, infecting more than  <dig> million people each year, two to three million of whom die  <cit> . the characteristic malarial fevers occur in multiples of  <dig> hr due to synchronous parasite development and proliferation in the host's red blood cells , corresponding to cell lysis and massive liberation of new parasites and toxins into the host's bloodstream  <cit> . clinical studies in south east asia have demonstrated that parasite lines which proliferate at an increased rate in rbc are more virulent than those with low multiplication rates, indicating a relationship between parasite growth and disease severity  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms directing the rate of parasite growth and development in the erythrocytic cycle are not well understood, underscoring the need to identify candidate genes regulating these processes.

the parasite erythrocytic cycle involves invasion of rbc by a merozoite, followed by a 'ring' stage that begins to ingest haemoglobin. digestive vesicles merge into a larger digestive vacuole characteristic of the metabolically active trophozoite stage that is active for dna replication, transcription and translation functions  <cit> . unlike other eukaryotic organisms, plasmodium spp. does not undergo cytokinesis after each successive round of dna replication. instead, dna replication and mitosis occur multiple times within the same cell body - a process known as endomitosis resulting in the schizont containing 8- <dig> merozoites  <cit> . progression of p. falciparum through the erythrocytic cycle takes approximately  <dig> hours  <cit> ; however, we previously observed a shortened cell cycle in dd <dig> compared to hb <dig> due to a shortened time in the ring and trophozoite stages  <cit> . these stages correspond to the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle and make up the majority of the parasites erythrocytic cycle. this observation is consistent with the progression of toxoplasma gondii, another apicomplexan parasite, through its tachyzoite cell cycle  <cit> .

the development through the erythrocytic cycle requires coordinated expression of distinct sets of genes. based on expectations of homologous functions with yeast, progression through the malaria parasite cycle is directed by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases   <cit> . five candidate cdks have been described in p. falciparum; pfpk <dig> a homologue to cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  pfpk <dig> a homologue to cdk <dig> and mapks, pfmrk a homologue to cdk <dig>  pfcrk- <dig> a homologue to cdc <dig>  <cit> , and most recently pfcrk- <dig> a homologue of cdk-related kinase  <dig>  <cit> . both pfpk <dig> and pfmrk have cyclin-dependent activity, whereas pfpk <dig> does not  <cit> . pfpk <dig> is active during the erythrocytic cycle and has been implicated in regulation of nuclear division  <cit> . knock-out studies in p. berghei with the orthologue for pfcrk- <dig>  indicate this cyclin is essential for the completion of the erythrocytic cycle in plasmodium  <cit> . likewise, studies on pfcrk- <dig> demonstrate that it is also necessary for the development of the erythrocytic parasite and most likely plays a role in chromatin modification  <cit> . the myb-related transcription factors also participate in regulating the expression of genes involved in growth control and cell differentiation  <cit> . gissot et al. demonstrated that a decrease in the p. falciparum transcription factor pfmyb <dig> resulted in a 40% parasite growth inhibition altering the transcription of a handful of genes implicated in cell cycle regulation, dna repair and replication. these included genes such as pfpk <dig>  a proliferating cell nuclear antigen  shown to play a role in dna replication, and a pp1-like phosphatase  <cit> . additionally, a study by janse et al. demonstrated that removal of one of two copies of the eukaryotic elongation factor 1α  from p. berghei increased the cell cycle length by extending the g <dig> phase compared to the parent parasite line  <cit> .

quantitative trait loci  mapping combined with the resolution of whole-genome technologies offers unbiased access to genes, biological processes, and mutations throughout a genome and provides a point of entry into the parasite genome from which a list of candidate genes can be refined and narrowed down in an unbiased manner. the goal of qtl mapping is to determine the genetic architecture, i.e. the number, position, and types of genetic contributions, for a given phenotype. quantitative traits generally involve input from multiple genes acting in ways which may be additive, dominant, epistatic, or interactive and therefore will be associated with multiple qtls  <cit> .

qtl mapping in thirty-four progeny derived from a genetic cross between dd <dig>  a chloroquine resistant  parasite from indochina, and hb <dig>  a chloroquine sensitive  parasite from honduras has been used to identify the gene regulating chloroquine  resistance, plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter   <cit> , and more recently the loci involved in quinine  susceptibility  <cit> . the dd <dig> × hb <dig> cross is characterized by high recombination resolution and cultured haploid progeny lines that can be repeatedly assayed for genome-wide sequence and transcription data, making it an excellent system for identifying genes and mechanisms that have diverged between the parental lines  <cit> . here we characterize the genetic architecture of erythrocytic cell cycle duration in progeny from the dd <dig> × hb <dig> cross and pinpoint candidate genes regulating this cycle time  in p. falciparum  <cit> . we identify a major qtl on chromosome  <dig> that interacts epistatically with a locus on chromosome  <dig> and two additional additive loci to account for nearly 75% of the phenotype variation inherited among the progeny. we draw on existing genome-wide datasets including sequence polymorphisms  <cit> , transcriptional polymorphisms and expression correlations between progeny expression and ct  <cit>  and interaction network  <cit>  to prioritize candidate genes and their interactions.

RESULTS
progeny inherit quantitative differences in cycle time
previous work identified a statistically significant difference in ct duration in the parent lines   <cit> . the greatest deviation in cycle time duration was observed in the ring and early trophozoite stages whereas the late trophozoite and schizont stages showed insignificant deviations from each other. cycle time was measured with biological replication in all  <dig> progeny of the dd <dig> × hb <dig> cross, revealing a continuous distribution of this trait across the progeny set, indicating that ct is a complex, quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes .

quantitative trait loci  mapping of cycle time
qtl mapping was used to identify associations between ct and microsatellite  markers distributed throughout the genome to identify chromosome regions carrying polymorphisms that impact ct. qtl scans locate most of the genetic determination of the phenotype variation  at one main locus on chromosome  <dig> at marker c1m <dig>  with a highly significant lod score  . in addition to the main effect, several minor peaks on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were evident but not significant in the context of the chromosome  <dig> effect. consequently, the remaining unassigned fraction of ct variation was analyzed using secondary scans of the residual variation after statistically removing the effect from the chromosome  <dig> locus; subsequent genome-wide scans identified markers c14m <dig> and c14m <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  . inheritance of a d allele at any of these three markers produces progeny with a significantly faster ct than progeny inheriting an h allele . marker c1m <dig> exhibits an additive effect with marker c14m <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  such that progeny inheriting a d allele at both markers have a significantly  faster ct  than those with an h allele at both markers  .

definitions of terms: sig. significance values were determined by  <dig> permutations of data, df - degree of freedom associated with each term in the model, ss - associated sum of squares, adj. ss - adjusted sums of squares , % variance - total variance explained by the adjusted sums of squares, f statistics are based on adj ss, p values are based on the f distribution.

next, we ran pairwise scans to search for epistatic  interactions between loci; an epistatic interaction is non-additive, such that the allelic contribution of one locus is observable only in the context of allele at the second locus. an interaction between c1m <dig> and a fourth marker on chromosome  <dig>  c4m <dig> was identified . no effect was detected for c4m <dig> independently. inheritance of the h allele at marker c4m <dig> and a d allele at c1m <dig> results in parasites with the fastest ct  . progeny inheriting an h allele at both markers have a significantly  slower ct . when all three markers are analyzed together, progeny inheriting the hhh  allele combination have the slowest ct  while hdd progeny exhibit the fastest ct  . together the multiple qtl model for ct shows four loci, one on chromosome  <dig>  two on chromosome  <dig> and one on chromosome  <dig> contributing to  <dig> % of the observed variation .

bioinformatic filtering of ct candidate gene list
the four ct qtls cover approximately  <dig> % of the parasite's  <dig> mb genome. a preliminary cumulative list of  <dig> candidate genes was compiled for these loci . the comprehensive gene list in these loci, including gene ids and ontology  annotations, is provided in the supplemental data . as an initial step, we examine the genes in this locus for functionally relevant candidates that could plausibly be tied to cell cycle regulatory events or dna replication. some such candidates include two minichromosome maintenance proteins involved in dna replication  in the chromosome  <dig> qtl. the chromosome  <dig> locus contains two serine/threonine protein kinases that could participate in cell cycle control . marker c14m <dig> is near a pp1-like protein serine/threonine phosphatase . the chromosome  <dig> region contains a ran binding protein implicated in dna replication . ran proteins are nuclear gtpases thought to be involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport and to play a role in mrna processing and cell cycle regulation. notably, genes with functional annotations are in the minority and may not necessarily be involved in the measured phenotype; nearly 68% of the genes encode conserved hypothetical proteins. while functional candidates may merit further interest, we also established unbiased biological criteria to generate comprehensive gene lists irrespective of annotation.

three criteria were used to refine the gene list: snp density between parental lines, correlations between transcriptome profiles of the parents, and correlation of the phenotype with gene expression in the progeny . given the continued growth of the genome-wide information, e.g. metabolites, protein interactions, chromatin modifications, these filtering criteria will become increasingly expansive in future studies progeny are likely to inherit structural or expressional polymorphisms in genes which differ between parent lines thereby contributing to observed differences in ct. the top 25% of the values from each criterion was used for cross-filtering. . snp density refers to a comparison of the parent lines to determine the number of snps  found within a genomic region. for snp density the cutoff was set at  <dig>  . because not all polymorphic differences are due to structural changes in the gene itself, we also used expression data from the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle. the values used are a correlation of the expression profiles between the parents. in this case the cutoff value was assigned as the lowest 25% of the correlation values at  <dig>  . finally, because correlating expression traits with phenotypes can highlight pathways, we evaluated expression profiles for correlation with ct variation within the progeny. the cutoff value was assigned as the top 25% of the expression correlation values at  <dig>  . these three screening criteria were used in parallel each resulting in an approximate 75% reduction of genes. there was some overlap between the genes which were eliminated resulting in 57% reduction in the gene list. genes meeting any one of these criteria were kept, reducing the list to  <dig> genes of which  <dig> are of unknown biological function .

to include the large percentage of hypothetical genes in our analytical framework, we incorporated data from protein interactions and gene networks to assign likely functions to hypothetical proteins. twenty of  <dig> genes in the candidate list were included in the yeast two hybrid network containing  <dig> proteins  <cit> . in addition, plasmomap, a protein network generated with computational and functional genomics data, provides information for  <dig> genes  <cit> . for our analysis, once a putative function is assigned, genes containing an enriched function are flagged as possibly contributing to ct. functional enrichment is defined as an over-representation of a particular gene ontology  annotation in a subset of genes whose expression profiles across the progeny correlate with ct. the most enriched go functions in the genes correlating with ct are: dna metabolic process , antigenic variation , protein amino acid dephosphorylation  and cell-cell adhesion and cytoadherence to microvasculature . candidate genes involved in any of these functions is given preference as being a gene regulating ct differences in p. falciparum. this step effectively eliminated another two thirds of the genes in the initial list of  <dig> narrowing it down to  <dig> candidate ct genes .

adata set refers to the interaction data used to imply the function of the protein. data from plasmomap is denoted by pm and data from the yeast two-hybrid is denoted by y <dig>  genes with a known function from the gene ontology are indicated by go.

given the well-described role of cyclins in regulating cell cycle progression, we ascertained the potential direct physical interactions with cyclins among our candidate genes. using domain information for proteins encoded by candidate genes within the qtl, we built an interaction network between the proteins using cyclins as a seed using a previously described algorithm for predicting domain-domain interactions given proteins with identifiable domains  <cit> . only genes annotated as coding for cyclins were considered . a protein-protein interaction network in which three of the genes from the list of  <dig> candidates interact with the seeded proteins was produced by this procedure .

we extended this network to test possible interactions involving the additional  <dig> genes from the initial candidate gene list, but no additional interactions were found. several proteins are connected to the network, including nucleosome assembly protein  and zinc transcription factor krox  <dig> , both found at the main qtl on chromosome  <dig>  and the protein ribosomal protein 7lae-related protein  located at the interacting locus on chromosome  <dig>  the nucleosome assembly protein  was selected based on its relatively weak correlation between dd <dig> and hb <dig> transcription profiles, however, snp density and phenotype-expression correlation highlight differences. in contrast, the zinc finger transcription factor  had a high snp density between dd <dig> and hb <dig> exhibiting  <dig> nonsynonymous and  <dig> synonymous snps. in addition to having a high snp density, the ribosomal protein also showed a strong correlation between the cycle time phenotype and expression data across the progeny.

discussion
we showed previously that the cqr and multi-drug resistant parasite, dd <dig>  proliferates faster than its cqs counterpart, hb <dig>  and that one component of this faster growth rate is due to a shorter g <dig> phase in the erythrocytic cycle of dd <dig>  <cit> . here we demonstrate that progeny inherit ct as a range of values indicative of a complex trait influenced by multiple genes. our multi-locus genetic model of the determinants of this trait includes four loci accounting for  <dig> % of the variance in ct; the main effect on chromosome  <dig>  two additive interactions on chromosome  <dig>  and a locus on chromosome  <dig> that interacts epistatically with the large chromosome  <dig> effect . progeny inheriting a d allele at the markers on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> exhibit significantly faster cts compared to progeny inheriting an h allele .

this difference in ct length between parasites appears to be a result of a shortened or elongated amount of time in the ring and trophozoite stages  <cit> . it is during these stages that the dna replication, transcription and translation occurs  <cit> . to narrow the list of genes falling within qtl regions, we developed a method to draw on the existing databases to prioritize candidate genes using genome-wide data from independent sources and to indicate functions of candidates based on their relationship with other known genes, even in the absence of an annotation.

plasmodium spp. have unique features of cell cycle regulation; consequently standard homology-based assumptions may miss important components. by utilizing an unbiased approach that relies on both genetics and networks of biological interactions we can retain hypothetical genes in our model, while also drawing on the rich data available from model organisms. interestingly, all three of the genes predicted by our protein interaction network were also contained in the final gene list produced by the unbiased filtering .

functional analysis of genes correlating with the ct trait identified an enrichment of genes involved in dna metabolism . according to the gene ontology database http://amigo.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/amigo/go.cgi, the go annotation of dna metabolism includes a suite of molecular functions including: dna replication, elongation, ligation, maintenance, mutagenesis, repair, modification and packaging. mutations within genes involved in the dna metabolic process would affect the efficiency of dna replication and therefore the rate at which it is completed. assuming p. falciparum, like other eukaryotic organisms, has a dna checkpoint in its cell cycle, a delay in dna replication would have an effect on the progression of the parasite through its erythrocytic cycle.

studies in yeast and bacteria have shown that progression through the cell cycle is regulated by a complex process of protein synthesis, degradation and phosphorylation using cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases  and ubiquitin. these proteins ensure that imperative steps are completed before the cell moves into the next stage of the cell cycle. for example, cells must first complete dna replication before moving into mitosis thereby preventing the formation of new cells which do not contain the proper number of dna molecules. several homologues for cyclins and cdks have been identified in the plasmodium genome; although their specific roles are poorly understood  <cit> . no known plasmodium cyclins and cdks were found in our qtl, indicating that these genes  are not involved in this phenotype; however, our method allows us to integrate candidates with possible role for these classic cell cycle determinants. this approach is based on the hypothesis that genes underlying qtl effects operate indirectly through physical interactions with key cell cycle regulators, specifically cyclins. the predicted domain-domain based protein interaction network identified interactions between three genes in the candidate list with cyclins, depicting the possibility that the genes could regulate the cell cycle indirectly by relaying regulatory messages. this form of indirect regulation of biological processes such as the cell cycle could enable biological systems to respond to different environmental stimuli to which they have no direct interactions with.

we highlight candidate genes in the chromosome  <dig> qtl, and one at the interacting loci on chromosome  <dig>  that could play a role in dna metabolism and have an effect on the length of the parasite's erythrocytic cycle: pfl0185c, nucleosome assembly protein and pfl0465c, zinc finger transcription factor  on chromosome  <dig> and pfd0960c ribosomal protein l7ae-related protein on chromosome  <dig>  all of these were identified as candidates by the protein interaction network. nucleosome assembly proteins  are involved in chromatin assembly and remodelling in order to allow for replication, transcription, recombination and repair of dna. they play a role in the global changes of chromatin structure which control the progression of p. falciparum through its lifecycle  <cit> . a recent study characterized the role of two nucleosome assembly proteins in p. falciparum, pfnaps  and pfnapl , which bind to histones; phosphorylation of these proteins by casein kinase ii results in conformational changes increasing the histone binding affinity  <cit> . the pfnaps was shown to have a higher affinity for histones than pfnapl and is proposed to strip the histones from pfnapl. it shuttles the histones into the nucleus and deposits them onto dna for chromatin remodelling. a polymorphism in this gene could affect the function of pfnapl and could affect the rate at which replication occurs resulting in a change of cell cycle length. pfnapl localizes in the cytoplasm of the parasite. attempts to disrupt the gene were not successful suggesting that its role in p. falciparum is essential for parasite survival  <cit> .

the zinc transcription factor  is also candidate for regulating differences in cycle duration. krox- <dig> was identified in sea urchin embryos and shown to play a role in the development of the vegetal-plate  <cit> . it is in the same family as the blimp- <dig> transcription factor which is required for the development of plasma cells from b cells  <cit> . blimp- <dig> has been shown to be up-regulated in malignant cells compared to b-cells and is involved in the transduction pathway for growth factors in multiple myeloma  <cit> . a recent study has shown that krox- <dig> is unregulated in p, falciparum parasites treated with inhibitors of s-adenosylmethinonine decarboxylase/ornithine decarboxylase which block the synthesis of spermidine and subsequently cell cycle progression  <cit> .

the third candidate identified by the protein interaction network is ribosomal protein l7ae-related protein, pfd0960c. the gene for this protein is located at the interacting loci on chromosome  <dig>  the network shows a path through which this gene could have an epistatic effect, on the genes located on chromosome  <dig>  a study of larynx carcinoma cells resistant to the drug taxol, which stalls cells in the g2/m phase of the cell cycle, were shown to have elevated levels of ribosomal protein l7a  <cit> . expression data between the parents shows the multi-drug resistant dd <dig> to have an approximate  <dig> -fold increase of pfd0960c compared to hb <dig>  suggesting the malarial ribosomal protein l7ae may play an important role in regulation of the parasite lifecycle  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, this study provides a new method to elucidate genes and functions involved in the regulation of the p. falciparum cell cycle. regulation of the parasite erythrocytic cycle is complex, involving multiple genes and pathways; consequently, a single genetic cross will capture only a subset of the genetic components existing in the general population. the genes and interactions identified in our analysis point to previously unrecognized mechanisms underlying divergent ct between hb <dig> and dd <dig>  we also describe an unbiased method to integrate qtl candidates with the wealth of published data to narrow candidate gene lists. using a protein interaction network seeded with cell cycle regulators, we found direct contact between  <dig> positional candidate genes and classical cell cycle genes. the overlap between these methods indicates that systematic, unbiased filtering can reveal new interactions and functions associate with key phenotypes.
