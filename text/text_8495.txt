BACKGROUND
cyclin d <dig>  a member of the g <dig> cyclins, plays an important role in the g <dig> phase progression of the cell cycle in proliferating cells via activation of cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> , cdk <dig>  or cdk <dig>  the cyclind/cdk4/ <dig> complexes induce the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma  protein and the release of e2f, which trigger g <dig> cell cycle progression. normally, rb binds to the members of the e2f family of transcription factors  <cit> . the expression and location of cyclin d <dig> and cdk <dig> in g <dig> cell cycle acts as the primary sensors of positive and negative environmental signals  <cit> . studies report that the expression and translocation of cyclind1-cdk <dig> are regulated by several signaling molecules, including pi3k/akt/mtor/p70s6k <dig> signaling  <cit> , jnk  <cit> , rho  <cit>  and nf-kappab  <cit> . all of them are present in the hippocampus, where they participate in the regulation of synaptic functionality and gene transcription  <cit> . however, the expression of cell cycle markers in the postnatal or adult brain is still a matter of controversial debate. ectopically expressed cyclind <dig> sequestered in the cytoplasm of post-mitotic neurons, whereas it efficiently entered the nucleus of proliferating progenitor cells  <cit> . even in the adult mouse hippocampus, cyclind1-cdk <dig> were found in terminally differentiated pyramidal and granule neurons, and also were found in dendrites and mossy fibers <cit> .

paradoxically, increasing evidence suggests that, cell cycle arrest and terminal differentiation of neurons may not be necessarily incompatible with cdk activity but raise the possibility that cdks and cyclins have physiological impact general effects, such as metabolic regulation  <cit> , basal transcription  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit>  or mechanisms of neuronal and synaptic plasticity  <cit> . a further function might be implicated in regulating microtubules stability  <cit>  thereby influencing morphoplastic processes. the present results suggest that the expression of cell cycle-related markers may have supplementary functions in differentiated neurons that might be associated with neuronal plasticity. in this study, we initiated to investigate the potential functions of cyclind1-cdk <dig> in neuronal plasticity during the postnatal development in mice hippocampus area ca <dig> 

RESULTS
neuronal expression and sub-cellular localization of cyclind1-cdk <dig> during the postnatal development in hippocampus area ca1
at p <dig>  hippocampal genesis is almost completed and the typical lamination is finished. perikarya of the stratum pyramidal display the characteristic pyramidal shape  <cit> . the immunofluorescent detection of cdk <dig> demonstrated a neuronal expression at p <dig> . expression of cdk <dig> was localized both in nuclei and cytoplasm of pyramidal cells of ca <dig> regions. in addition, mossy fibers were immuno-reactive as well . at p <dig>  the sub-cellular localization of cdk <dig> was different. staining of cdk <dig> could be detected predominantly in the cytoplasm but only sporadically in neuronal nuclei of pyramidal neurons of the ca subfields . further quantitative immunoblotting analysis confirmed the similar expression levels of cdk <dig> in p <dig> and p <dig> mice hippocampus .

basal synaptic transmission was normal in the presence of cdk <dig> inhibitor
having localized cdk <dig> in the hippocampus, we next determined the role of cyclind1-cdk <dig> in synaptic plasticity. we first examined whether the complex were required for normal basal synaptic transmission. we compared extracellular recordings of the sc-ca <dig> synapses in hippocampal slices  to slices pretreated with cdk <dig> inhibitor . there was not significantly different both at neonatal and adolescent animals ; fig. 2a, b). furthermore, the fepsp slope corre-sponding to a given presynaptic fiber volley was also unaffected by cdk <dig> inhibitor application throughout development ; fig. 2c, d). bath application of  <dig> μm cdk <dig> inhibitor to slices from p8- <dig> and p21- <dig> animals did not affect the fepsp slope, even after  <dig> h in the perfusion buffer . previous studies have shown that these concentrations are adequate to inhibit cdk <dig> kinase activity in cells  <cit> .

cyclind1-cdk <dig> mediated short-term synaptic plasticity
we next examined whether the complex were involved in paired-pulse facilitation, a form of short-term plasticity. as shown in fig.  <dig>  at six different inter-stimulus intervals ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> ms, the mean paired-pulse facilitation ratio  was reduced in cdk <dig> inhibitor pre-incubated slices  as compared with control , at time intervals from  <dig> to  <dig> ms , at the neonatal stage , surprisingly there was no significant decrease in ppf when applied to slices from adolescent animals  . these results demonstrated that cyclind1-cdk <dig> may have the effect of modulating pre-synaptic function at the neonatal stage but not at the adolescent stage. this difference may be the consequence of the expression and translocation of cyclind1-cdk <dig> in neuronal cells in area ca <dig> at different development stage  <cit> .

as a second measure of short-term synaptic plasticity, we next compared the time evolution of the fepsp slopes during and following a brief tetanic stimulation. the schaffer collaterals were stimulated by a short  <dig> hz train  followed by a test stimulus delivered  <dig> ms after the end of the burst. we found that in the cdk <dig> inhibitor pretreated slices facilitation was greatly reduced during the burst  compared with control slices  and while the  <dig> ms after the burst was not significantly different . these observations suggested that cyclind1-cdk <dig> may regulate the availability of vesicles from the readily releasable pool during repetitive stimulation during the postnatal development.

cyclind1-cdk <dig> had no effect on the induction or the maintenance of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal ca <dig> region
to examine the role of cylind1-cdk <dig> in long-term synaptic plasticity, we tested ltp at the sc-ca <dig> synapses. ltp was induced by hfs  to the schaffer collateral inputs. the amount of ltp was quantified as the average fepsp slope  <dig> min after hfs relative to the baseline mean slope. inhibition of cdk <dig> had no significant effect on the induction or maintenance of ltp after  <dig> min both for p8- <dig>  and p21- <dig> . we did not examine whether the expression of this form of ltp or other forms of ltp, such as those induced by theta stimulation or non-nmda receptor-dependent ltp in the ca <dig> region, are equally unaffected by cdk <dig> inhibitor.

cyclind1-cdk <dig> were required for mglur-dependent ltd in the hippocampal ca <dig> region
a metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent form of ltd  is expressed more strongly in neonatal synapses and can be preferentially induced by dhpg, a selective group i mglur agonist. therefore, the ability to develop and maintain this form of ltd was tested by applying dhpg  to hippocampal slices. as shown in fig.  <dig>  cdk <dig> inhibitor did not alter the acute depression of synaptic transmission induced by dhpg, in contrast,  <dig> min after washout of dhpg, the fepsp slope increased gradually in cdk <dig> inhibitor pretreated slices, while in control slices it remained depressed. in control slices, the fepsp slope was reduced to  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the baseline average value  <dig> min after application of dhpg , whereas, preincubation of slices with the cdk <dig> inhibitor, significantly inhibited the later phase of dhpg-ltd, fepsp slope had recovered to  <dig> ±  <dig> % of average baseline   in neonatal animals . dhpg-ltd was also reduced by cdk <dig> inhibitor in adolescent animals  compared with control slices  .

when ltd was induced by pp-lfs , the results on ltd induction and maintenance were similar to those obtained with dhpg-induced ltd. the later phase of the pp-lfs-induced ltd almost disappeared by cdk <dig> inhibitor  in the p8- <dig> group while the fepsp slope in the p21- <dig> group  recovered to  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the baseline at  <dig> min  .

a different form of ltd, nmda receptor dependent ltd , has been described at ca <dig> synapses. consistent with the idea that mglur- and nmdar-ltd are mediated by distinct cellular mechanisms  <cit> , cdk <dig> inhibitor- treated slices showed similar levels of nmdar-ltd induced by lfs  to control slices both from neonatal and adolescent animals as shown in fig. 5e, f. after  <dig> min, fepsp slope was  <dig> ±  <dig> % and  <dig> ±  <dig> % in slices from p8- <dig> and p21- <dig> mice respectively, moreover  <dig> ±  <dig> % and  <dig> ±  <dig> % in cdk <dig> inhibitor pretreated slices. these results indicated that cyclind1-cdk <dig> are specifically required for mglur dependent ltd, but do not play a significant role in nmdar-ltd.

discussion
it has been well documented that neurogenesis persists in the adult brain but normally only within discrete regions of the brain containing pluripotent neuronal precursors   <cit> . several studies have reported the expression of cyclins and cdks in terminally differentiated neurons of the dentate gyrus and other brain regions, especially in the context of seizure, transient global ischemia, adrenal steroids, stress or apoptotic events  <cit> . cell cycle arrest and terminal differentiation of neurons may not be necessarily incompatible with cdk activity but raise the possibility that cdks and cyclins have physiological impact general effects, such as metabolic regulation  <cit> , basal transcription  <cit>  or apoptosis  <cit> . a further function might be implicated in regulating microtubules stability  <cit>  thereby influencing morphoplastic processes.

our study showed that cell cycle regulatory protein cdk <dig> had been also located in the cytoplasm and nuclei of postnatal  and even adolescent  neurons in the ca subfields of the hippocampus. the detection of cdk <dig> in postmitotic neurons suggested a physiological role beyond the regulation of cell cycle g <dig> checkpoint, because immunoreactivity of it was detected predominantly in perikaryal cytoplasm. a putative function of constitutive cyclin expression in postmitotic neurons has been previously implicated in mechanisms of neuronal and synaptic plasticity  <cit> . western blot analyses revealed the presence of cdk <dig> at the two developmental stages. however, the study was not designed to identify relative changes in the expression levels during the development.

the expression and translocation of g <dig> cyclins are regulated mostly by pi3k/akt/mtor/p70s6k <dig> signaling  <cit> , which is activated by distinct tyrosine kinases and are present in the hippocampus, where they participate in the regulation of synaptic functionality and gene transcription.  <cit> . our observations of a significant reduction of ppf in slices pretreated with cdk <dig> inhibitor from neonatal animals  suggested a role of cyclind1-cdk <dig> in neurotransmitter release at the early development stage. but there was no significant decrease in ppf when applied to slices from adolescence animals . ptp, another form of short-term synaptic plasticity, was also impaired in cdk <dig> inhibitor pre-incubated slices from both neonatal and adolescent animals. all these data suggested that cyclind1-cdk <dig> mediated short-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices.

distinct transmitter release properties determine differences in short-term plasticity  <cit> . this form of synaptic enhancement is caused by a ca2+-dependent increase in release probability and releasable vesicle pool size <cit> , the residual elevation in pre-synaptic ca2+i acting on one or more molecular targets that appear to be distinct from the secretory trigger responsible for fast exocytosis and phasic release of transmitter to single action potentials. previous studies suggested that silent synapses are not only exist post-synaptically but also pre-synaptically <cit>  in developing hippocampal neurons. the available silent synapses can often be rapidly activated, in many instances. these properties enable silent synapses to participate in short-term plasticity <cit> . cdk <dig> inhibitor had dramatic effects on ppf and ptp at the early development stage  in our experiments, which is apparent involved in calcium release or the activation of pre-synaptic silent synapse. on the other hand, it was surprised to see such different effect on ppf by cdk <dig> inhibitor during the development; these findings demonstrating that cyclind1-cdk <dig> have a developmental effect change that modulates pre-synaptic function. one hypothesis to consider is that this difference might be due to the developmental change of silent synapse in hippocampal neurons. however, the exactly mechanism interfered with needs further study.

phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is required for the expression but not for the induction or the maintenance of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal ca <dig> region <cit> . however, there is still lack of information concerning the involvement cyclind1-cdk <dig> long term synaptic plasticity mechanisms. our observations found that cyclind1-cdk <dig> inhibitor did not affect the induction or the maintenance of ltp both at p8-p <dig> and at p21- <dig>  future studies are aimed at determining whether the expression phase of this form of ltp or other forms of ltp are affected.

two mechanistically distinct forms of ltd coexist in synapses in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus  <cit> . induction of one form depends on activation of nmda receptors  <cit> , while induction of the other depends on activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors  <cit> . the locus of mglur-ltd expression is unclear. several studies have reported that mglur-ltd is associated with increases in paired-pulse facilitation  <cit>  and changes in miniature epsc frequency <cit> , suggesting that the expression of mglur-ltd is pre-synaptic. in addition, it was reported that the pre-synaptic vesicle release and cycling are altered during mglur-ltd  <cit> . however, these findings do not eliminate the possibility of a postsynaptic contribution to mglur-ltd. for example, it has been shown that mglur-ltd is dependent on postsynaptic protein synthesis  <cit> . recently, nosyreva and huber  found that there is a developmental switch in synaptic mechanisms of hippocampal mglur-dependent ltd  <cit> . in adolescent animals , mglur activation induces ltd require protein synthesis, whereas in neonatal animals , mglur-ltd is independent of protein synthesis, instead, results in pre-synaptic function. a previous study  <cit>  reported that activation of the pi3k-akt-mtor pathway is required for mglu-ltd, and is known to be required for dendritic protein synthesis, although cannot exclude the possibility of an additional pre-synaptic function. determination of downstream effectors of pi3k-akt-mtor pathway will be necessary for mglur-ltd to begin to elucidate the identities of the proteins that are synthesized in dendrites during this type of synaptic plasticity.

in this study, we found that mglur-ltd was impaired in slices from cdk <dig> inhibitor pretreated slices both from neonatal animals  and adolescent animals , and the similar effect was present in ppf-lfs-induced ltd. however, the effect of the cdk <dig> inhibitor at slices from adolescent animals was not as robust as slices from neonatal animals on this form of ltd. this difference may be due to the distinct role of cyclind1-cdk <dig> at the two developmental stages during this form of ltd. in conclusion, our findings demonstrated that cyclind1-cdk <dig> are required for mglur-ltd, and the complex may have two different roles during the developmental stage in synaptic mechanisms of hippocampal mglur-dependent ltd. a more likely possibility is that pi3k is an important regulator of the protein synthesis dependent phase of ltp and regulates neuronal protein synthesis in response to different extracellular stimuli  <cit> . as a downstream effecter of pi3k-akt-mtor pathway, at p21- <dig>  cyclind1-cdk <dig> may be required for mglur-dependent ltd through activate the rb/e2f <dig> pathway to partly initiate some dendritic protein synthesis that are necessary for the expression of mglur-ltd, the incomplete blockage of mglur-ltd, suggest that other signaling pathways may play an other or additional role in mglur-ltd. whereas at p8- <dig>  may be due to its pres-synaptic function.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we observed the expression and sub-cellular localization of cyclind1-cdk <dig> during the postnatal development stage, and cyclind1-cdk <dig> may mediate stp but not basal synaptic transmission. the induction or the maintenance of long-term potentiation  in response to a strong tetanus and nmda receptor-dependent long-term depression  are normal in hippocampus, whereas mglur-dependent ltd is significantly inhibited in slices that pre-incubated by cdk <dig> inhibitor during the postnatal development. these findings demonstrate a function role for cyclind1-cdk <dig> in short-term plasticity and in mglur-dependent synaptic depression in the hippocampus, and suggest that this cyclin-dependent kinase may have different roles during the postnatal development in mice hippocampus area ca <dig>  future studies aimed at the exactly mechanism interfered with, and the role of activation of cyclind1-cdk <dig> in the effect of lead on synaptic plasticity and cell death in hippocampus following development.
