BACKGROUND
splicing of precursor mrna is one of the essential cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms. although this process has been extensively studied since the discovery of splicing three decades ago  <cit> , resulting in a thorough understanding of the splicing pathway and identification of the numerous components of the splicing machinery, there are still many unanswered questions. for example, while the ability of pre-mrna to form intramolecular interactions between short complementary segments in long yeast introns was initially suggested  <dig> years ago  <cit> , the role of pre-mrna secondary structure in splicing is not well understood.

introns in s. cerevisiae are known to have bimodal length distribution  <cit>  and can be classified into short and long introns based on their length. the distance between the 5' splice site and the branchpoint sequence, also known as the 'lariat length' or 'branchpoint distance' , is tightly correlated with intron length  and can also be used to classify introns into long  and short   <cit> . it was hypothesized that 5'l introns, for which the branchpoint distance is greater than  <dig> nt, can fold into secondary structures to optimize the positioning of the 5' splice site and branchpoint sequence to one that is optimal for spliceosome assembly  <cit> . this hypothesis was confirmed for a limited number of yeast introns by comprehensive biological experiments that demonstrated that the existence of such secondary structure elements is essential for splicing efficiency  <cit> . structural elements that exhibit a similar effect on splicing efficiency were also found in introns of drosophila melanogaster and related species  <cit> . furthermore, in mammalian cells, folding of long intron sequences is facilitated by protein binding and interactions, which presumably shortens the long distance between essential splicing sequences  <cit> .

the nature of the base-pairing interactions within introns and their effect on splicing efficiency were most extensively studied in s. cerevisiae's ribosomal protein gene rps17b, previously known as rp51b . it was shown that secondary structure interaction between two sequence segments located downstream of the 5' splice site and upstream of the branchpoint sequence promotes efficient splicing of the rps17b pre-mrna  <cit> . this interaction was further tested by comprehensive mutational and structure-probing analysis to determine the structure of the stem formed in the wildtype intron and the sensitivity of splicing efficiency to the alterations in this stem  <cit> . these studies demonstrated that complementary pairing between two ends of the rps17b intron, but not necessarily the formation of the described stem, is essential for its efficient splicing in vitro and in vivo.

while the authors of the previous studies speculated that the function of the complementary pairing is to shorten the branchpoint distance, they did not attempt to determine the secondary structure of the intron and the resulting 'structural' branchpoint distance. thus a functional relationship between this distance and the splicing efficiency remains unknown.

in this paper we use computational rna secondary structure prediction to investigate the secondary structures of wildtype and mutant intron sequences within the s. cerevisiae rps17b pre-mrna. we present a unique algorithm for measuring 'structural' distance between two bases in an rna secondary structure and use it to compute the distance between the 5' splice site and the branchpoint sequence based on the predicted secondary structure. our analysis show that there is a tight correlation between structural branchpoint distances and splicing efficiency levels for all mutants examined.

RESULTS
secondary structure of rps17b intron and the efficiency of splicing
the first goal of our study was to determine if the splicing efficiency results previously reported for rps17b intron  <cit>  can be correlated with the computationally predicted secondary structures of wildtype and mutant intron sequences.

in this study the sensitivity of splicing to alterations in the stem formed in the rps17b intron was tested by introducing mutations in the interacting regions designated ub <dig>  and db <dig> . the assumption behind the mutant design was that any mutation within the stem would disrupt it and change the intron secondary structure in such a way that the resulting structural branchpoint distance  would be greater than for the wildtype intron. the authors created  <dig> mutant introns within the rps17b gene: 3mub <dig> , 4mub <dig> , 5mub <dig> , 6mub <dig>  and 8mub <dig> , where mutations fall in the ub <dig> region; 3mdb <dig>  and 5mdb <dig> , where mutations fall in the db <dig> region and are designed to restore the base-pairing disrupted by the mutations in the 3mub <dig> and 5mub <dig>  respectively; and 3mub1_3mdb <dig> and 5mub1_5mdb <dig>  which are double mutants. all of the single mutants are expected to disrupt the secondary structure, while the double mutants are predicted to restore it. the rps17b intron was inserted into the coding region of the copper resistance gene , which served as a reporter gene. thus, yeast cells grown on copper containing medium will be viable only if the intron-containing cup <dig> mrna is spliced. the results of this assay suggested that for all single mutants except 8mub <dig>  splicing was reduced. surprisingly, 8mub <dig> had a similar growth rate on copper media as the wildtype intron suggesting that splicing was as efficient. out of two double mutants, 5mub1_5mdb <dig> was able to partially rescue copper resistance, while 3mub1_3mdb <dig> did not. the authors hypothesized that these unexpected results were the result of some secondary structure rearrangements; however, the secondary structure of the mutants 8mub <dig> and 3mub1_3mdb <dig> was not explored.

in order to investigate if the differences in the splicing efficiency levels are due to the differences in secondary structures, we computed the minimum free energy  structures of the introns using mfold  <cit> , one of the most frequently used rna secondary structure prediction tools. the comparative rna secondary structure prediction, which is considered more reliable, requires a certain number of orthologous sequences which were available only for the wildtype rps17b intron and not for the mutants created in  <cit> .

according to the mfold mfe predictions, the introduced mutations have the desired effect of disrupting the stem in all single mutants, but the compensatory mutations fail to restore it in two double mutants. focusing on the positioning between the donor site and the branchpoint sequence, we compared the part of the structure that contains these two sites across all the mutants. the specified structural domain was almost identical for the 3mub <dig>  5mub <dig>  8mub <dig>  3mdb <dig>  3mub1_3mdb <dig> and 5mub1_5mdb <dig> mutants, some of which have very different splicing efficiency levels . moreover, the full secondary structures of the 3mub <dig> and 3mub1_3mdb <dig> mutants were almost identical with only three base-pairs difference, while the copper resistance experiment suggested significant differences in splicing efficiency. therefore, it appears that differences in the splicing efficiency of libri et al.'s  <cit>  mutants cannot be attributed to differences in the computed mfe secondary structures of introns.

however, considering only a single, minimum free energy secondary structure prediction of an intron might not be the appropriate approach. while functional, non-coding rnas, such as trnas and rrnas, have a strong evolutionary pressure to maintain their unique, functional structure, it is believed that mrnas, whose primary role is to carry the protein coding information to the translation apparatus, do not have functional constraints on their global structure. thus, instead of always folding into unique mfe structure, it is likely that mrnas exist in a population of structures  <cit> . another reason for considering suboptimal structures, especially when using computational prediction methods, is that rna secondary structure prediction algorithms have limited accuracy and sometimes the correct structure is buried among the suboptimal predictions with free energies very close to the mfe  <cit> .

structural branchpoint distances of suboptimal secondary structures and the efficiency of splicing
based on these considerations, we modified our approach to include not only the optimal, i.e., mfe structure, but also near-optimal predictions whose free energies are within 5% of the optimum. there is an exponential relationship between the free energy of a structure and its probability in the ensemble of all possible structures for a given sequence. the probability of a structure si in the boltzmann ensemble of all possible structures  for a given rna sequence is given by:

  p=e−Δg/rtq 

where Δg is the free energy of structure si, q = Σs e-Δg/rt the partition function for all possible secondary structures for the given sequence, r is the physical gas constant, and t is the temperature. the probability of a secondary structure is also called the boltzmann weight of that structure.

from the equation we can see that the lower the free energy of a structure the higher its probability, thus, the predictions within 5% from the mfe also represent the most probable structures for a given sequence, with the mfe prediction being the one with the highest probability.

we used rnasubopt algorithm  <cit>  to sample  <dig> suboptimal structures within 5% of the mfe for each considered intron. rnasubopt first calculates all suboptimal structures within a user defined energy range and then produces a random sample of structures, drawn with probabilities equal to their boltzmann weights. therefore, rnasubopt computes a representative sample of the secondary structure space within 5% of the mfe.

since the pair-wise structure comparison and distance estimation approach that we used for mfe structure predictions were not applicable to large number of structures we had to devise a new way to quantify the structural distance between the donor site and the branchpoint sequence. we designed an algorithm that converts an rna secondary structure into a graph and then applies a shortest-path algorithm from graph theory to compute the shortest distance between two bases in the secondary structure. to the best of our knowledge this is the first algorithm for structural distance computation. more details are given in materials and methods.

for each secondary structure prediction, we computed the exact distance between the donor site and the branchpoint sequences  using the shortest-path algorithm. the average structural branchpoint distances are given in table  <dig>  we assigned descriptive splicing efficiency labels based on the gel images in figure 2a in  <cit> . the distributions of computed structural branchpoint distances for each of the rps17b mutants are given in figure  <dig> 

levels of splicing efficiency were approximated from the gel images in figure 2a in  <cit> . the numbers within parentheses correspond to numerical values assigned to descriptive splicing efficiency labels.

these results suggest an interesting correlation between the average structural branchpoint distance and the splicing efficiency levels: sequences that are more efficiently spliced  have lower values for the average distance than those that are poorly spliced. after assigning numerical values to the descriptive splicing efficiency labels  we obtain a pearson correlation coefficient of  <dig> .

the histograms in figure  <dig> offer further insights into the relationship between structural branchpoint distances of introns and their efficiency of splicing; introns that are spliced efficiently or with slightly reduced efficiency have large frequency of suboptimal structures with ds <  <dig>  mutant 5mub1_5mdb <dig>  which does not have this prominent peak in its distribution histogram and mutant 4mub <dig>  which has reduced splicing efficiency, but not completely inhibited, still have higher frequency of structures with ds <  <dig> than the remaining, poorly spliced mutants. the correlation coefficient between splicing efficiency level and the proportion of structures with ds <  <dig> is  <dig> .

finally, the cumulative distribution plot of structural branchpoint distances for all mutants, where lines are labeled according to the splicing efficiency levels  shows a clear separation of spliced and unspliced mutants .

upon closer inspection we noticed that most of the structures with ds <  <dig> have ds =  <dig>  analysis of the secondary structures of these sequences reveals that this distance corresponds to a structural conformation where the donor and branchpoint sequences have two base-pairing interactions between them . the observed base-pairing interactions are not necessarily inconsistent with established models of the splicing process, according to which spliceosomal snrnas interact with the donor site and the branchpoint sequence, since the base-pairing can be easily disrupted after the splicing factors have been aligned properly.

structural branchpoint distances and the efficiency of splicing for other published rps17b mutants
in order to test the generality of the observed correlation between splicing efficiency levels and structural branchpoint distances we also analyzed the rps17b intron mutants described in  <cit> . these are mut-ub1i, which has an inverted ub <dig> sequence; mut-db1i, which has an inverted db <dig> sequence; mut-ub1idb1i, which has both ub <dig> and db <dig> sequences inverted to make them complementary to each other; mut- <dig>  which reduces the consecutive pairing region to  <dig> base-pairs, mut-12; which improves pairing to  <dig> consecutive base-pairs ; and mut- <dig>  which extends pairing to  <dig> consecutive base-pairs . the authors compared splicing efficiency of the wildtype and mutant introns by analyzing the formation of spliceosomal complexes. based on their gel images, we assigned descriptive and numerical splicing efficiency labels to the tested sequences . the average structural branchpoint distances of  <dig> suboptimal structures sampled from within 5% of the mfe for each mutant are given in table  <dig> 

we inferred levels of splicing efficiency based on figures  <dig> and  <dig> and table  <dig> in  <cit> . the numbers within parentheses correspond to numerical values assigned to descriptive splicing efficiency labels.

the branchpoint distance results for these mutants are similar to those of libri et al.'s  <cit>  mutants; the average structural branchpoint distances are lower for the sequences that are efficiently spliced . after assigning numerical values to the descriptive splicing efficiency labels , we obtain the correlation coefficient as  <dig> . this, again, corresponds to the ability of these sequences to fold in such a way as to bring the donor site and the branchpoint sequences close to each other; each of the efficiently spliced sequences has a large fraction of predicted secondary structures for which ds <  <dig> . the mutants that show reduced splicing have very few of these structures , except for mut-db1i, which has  <dig> % of structures with ds <  <dig>  however, this is still significantly lower than for the efficiently spliced mutants. again, the cumulative distribution plot clearly separates mutants based on their splicing efficiency .

base-pairing probabilities of the rps17b intron and the efficiency of splicing
the branchpoint distance analysis of s. cerevisiae's rps17b intron suggests that the ability to form highly probable secondary structures  with short distance between the donor site and the branchpoint sequence seems to be required for efficient splicing of the intron. the short structural branchpoint distance for the rps17b intron results from two base-pair interactions: between the first intron base  and the third base of the branchpoint sequence ; and between the second base in the intron  and the second base of the branchpoint sequence  . it is possible to compute the probability of these base-pairing interactions directly using a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the partition function  <cit> . the base-pair probability reflects a sum of all probability-weighted structures in which the chosen base-pair occurs. thus, these base-pairing probabilities also take into account the structures that were not within 5% from the mfe, eliminating the necessity to chose an arbitrary percent suboptimality value. the base-pair probabilities can be computed using rnafold  <cit> , another frequently used program for rna secondary structure prediction.

the base-pair probability values for the wildtype rps17b intron and all of libri et al.'s  <cit>  mutants are given in table  <dig>  the probability values for the two base-pairs  are identical up to second decimal place for each intron sequence and that is why only one number is shown in the table. it can be observed that all of the efficiently spliced sequences have higher base-pair probabilities than the poorly spliced sequences . the correlation is not strictly linear since, for example, the mutant sequence 8mub <dig> has almost the same base-pair probability value as 3mub <dig> and 5mub <dig>  although it is more efficiently spliced than these two. similarly, the double mutant 5mub1_5mdb <dig> is more efficiently spliced than 4mub <dig>  but this is not reflected in the base-pair probability values.

for charpentier and rosbash's mutants, the base-pair probabilities are also higher for the sequences that are more efficiently spliced : all of the sequences that are efficiently spliced  have base-pair probabilities of  <dig> , while the other sequences have lower values .

overall, based on the results for libri et al.'s  <cit>  and charpentier and rosbash's  <cit>  mutants it seems that, at least for rps17b intron, base-pair probabilities for the two base-pairs formed between the first two bases of the intron and the second and third base of the branchpoint sequence are good indicators of splicing efficiency. we will see in the following sections that this is not a general requirement for all genes. taken together with the observed correlation between the splicing efficiency levels and structural branchpoint distances the results are consistent with the following hypothesis: the existence of highly probable secondary structures that have short branchpoint distance is required for efficient splicing of yeast introns.

experimental testing of the hypothesis
in order to test the validity of the proposed hypothesis, we designed and functionally tested in vivo a series of rps17b intron mutants. to assay the effect of these mutations on splicing we opted to introduce the mutated intron sequences at their endogenous locus, instead of within the cup <dig> gene as was previously done  <cit> . this allows us to analyze the splicing of this intron within its normal context of flanking dna sequences. we estimated the splicing efficiency directly from protein expression levels, which were quantified using a fluorescence imaging system.

using protein expression as a measurement of splicing efficiency requires that: 1) the level of protein abundance is proportional to the mrna abundance  in the cell and, 2) the abundance of mrna in the cell reflects any change in splicing efficiency. to demonstrate that rps17b follows these general rules, we analyzed a number of libri et al.'s  <cit>  mutants that have previously documented changes in mrna levels for their protein expression levels. the sequences tested were the wildtype rps17b intron, and the 5mub <dig>  3mub <dig>  8mub <dig>  5mdb <dig>  and 3mdb <dig> mutated introns. the levels of protein expression, as shown in figure  <dig>  are proportional to the levels of copper-resistance in the copper growth assay in  <cit> . moreover, our approach is able to provide a quantifiable measure for mutants such as 3mdb <dig> and 5mdb <dig>  which did not support any growth in the copper growth assay. thus, using changes in protein expression levels in the context of different intron sequences to assay the effects of mutations on splicing efficiency is a valid approach.

new rps17b intron mutants
we designed  <dig> new rps17b intron mutants for the purpose of testing our current model of correlation between intronic pre-mrna secondary structure and splicing efficiency. the most important structural characteristic used for mutant design was structural branchpoint distance  of its mfe and suboptimal structures. four mutants that are predicted to splice efficiently were designed to have multiple suboptimal structures with contact conformation  and short average structural branchpoint distance . the only exception is mutant rps17b-s <dig>  which does not have any suboptimal structures with contact conformation, but still exhibits a short structural branchpoint distance . this mutant was designed to test whether contact conformation, rather than the resulting short structural branchpoint distance, is important for splicing. four mutants that are predicted to have reduced splicing were designed not to have any structures with contact conformation or otherwise short structural branchpoint distances .

the mutant design was based on mfold predictions, while rnasubopt predictions where used post-experimentally to analyze the results. mfold also samples the suboptimal space of secondary structures, however it does not compute all possible structures and the sample is much smaller. although the distribution of ds computed based on structure predictions by mfold is similar to the one based on rnasubopt predictions, the average distances for rnasubopt predictions are not as distinct between 's' and 'l' mutants as ones based on mfold predictions.

avg – average structural branchpoint distances of  <dig> suboptimal structures predicted by rnasubopt; bp prob – base-pairing probability of interaction between the donor site and the branchpoint sequence based on the partition function.

as seen in figure  <dig>  mutants rps17b-l <dig>  rps17b-l <dig> and rps17b-l <dig> have reduced protein expression levels when compared to the wildtype as expected. mutant rps17b-l <dig> has reduced splicing efficiency but not as much as the other three mutants with long structural branchpoint distances. as previously explained, this mutant was designed to have reduced splicing based on suboptimal predictions by mfold, which failed to predict any structures with ds <  <dig>  however, rnasubopt, which does a more rigorous sampling of the suboptimal space, detected a small fraction of suboptimal structures that have ds <  <dig> . this is in agreement with the relatively high probability of base-pairing interaction between the donor site and the branchpoint sequence .

mutants rps17b-s <dig>  rps17b-s <dig>  and rps17b-s <dig> are all spliced efficiently, as predicted. the efficient splicing of mutant rps17b-s <dig>  which has short structural branchpoint distance  without contact conformation in many of the predicted structures, suggests that a specific structural arrangement between the donor site and the branchpoint sequence is not required for efficient splicing. mutant rps17b-s <dig> shows reduced levels of protein abundance, which is in disagreement with our prediction. the mutated sequence for this mutant has the same location as the mutated sequence for the mutant rps17b-s <dig>  which is efficiently spliced, thus we can exclude the possibility that the discrepancy in splicing is sequence-based. a possible explanation for this phenomenon may be the existence of a very thermodynamically stable stem  that holds the 5' splice site and the branchpoint together . this stem may be too stable to be disrupted, which might prevent the spliceosome to bind to the splice signals  <cit> . overall, the results on the new rps17b intron mutants are consistent with the proposed model of the role of intronic secondary structure in gene splicing in yeast.

selecting additional genes for experimental validation
to further validate our hypothesis regarding the role of intron secondary structure in splicing, we selected additional yeast, intron-containing genes to test our model. the selection criteria were: the linear distance  between the donor site and the branchpoint sequence is greater than  <dig> nt ; the intron does not contain an snrna gene; the gene is not essential ; and the protein product has relatively high abundance in the cell, is amenable to c-terminal tagging, and has molecular weight between 20– <dig> kda .

from our initial dataset of  <dig> yeast genes that contain 5'l introns ,  <dig> genes matched the selection criteria . we selected two of these for the experiments: the ribosomal protein gene rps6b  and the amino-peptidase gene ape <dig> .

the rps6b gene contains one intron of length  <dig> nt, with a linear branchpoint distance  of d =  <dig> nt. the computed structural branchpoint distance  is  <dig> for the mfe and all the suboptimal computationally predicted secondary structures within 5% of the mfe. thus for this intron, unlike for the rps17b intron, the donor and branchpoint sequences are not base-paired.

the ape <dig> gene contains one intron of length  <dig> nt, with a linear branchpoint distance of d =  <dig> nt. one of the suboptimal structures within 5% of the mfe has a structural branchpoint distance of  <dig> and the others have greater distances. in the suboptimal prediction that has ds =  <dig> there is no base-pairing interactions between the donor and branchpoint sequences.

rps6b intron mutants
we designed intron mutants for the rps6b gene in a similar manner as for the rps17b gene: the mutants that are supposed to have efficient splicing were designed to have similar structural branchpoint distances as the wildtype intron, and the mutants that are supposed to have reduced splicing were designed to have longer distances . table  <dig> shows average structural branchpoint distances for a sample of  <dig> suboptimal predictions within 5% of the mfe and the probability of short branchpoint distance derived form the base-pairing probabilities. the reported probability is the highest base-pair probability between the first donor nucleotide and any nucleotide within  <dig> bases away from the branchpoint adenosine. this guarantees that the branchpoint distance in a secondary structure that contains that base-pair will be no longer than  <dig> 

avg – average structural branchpoint distance; bp prob – probability of ds <  <dig> 

from figure  <dig> we can see that all of the 's' mutants, which have structural branchpoint distances similar to the wildtype intron, are expressed at levels similar to the wildtype. mutant rps6b-l <dig>  which has avg =  <dig> shows a reduction in splicing efficiency. the probability of ds <  <dig> also correlates well with the protein expression data except for mutant rps6b-s <dig> for which ds >  <dig> for all suboptimal predictions. thus, for the rps6b gene, structural branchpoint distances slightly longer than  <dig> seem to be still optimal for splicing. to summarize, the protein expression data for the rps6b gene containing designed intron mutants are compatible with our proposed model of splicing efficiency dependence on the structural branchpoint distance.

ape <dig> intron mutants
using the same selection criteria as before, we designed six ape <dig> intron mutants. the values for average ds and the probabilities of structural branchpoint distance shorter than  <dig> are given in table  <dig>  and the histograms of structural branchpoint distance distributions are given in additional file  <dig> 

avg – average structural branchpoint distance; bp prob – probability of ds <  <dig> 

the experimental results are consistent with our prediction for five out of seven mutants: mutants ape2-s <dig>  ape2-s <dig>  ape2-s <dig> and ape2-s <dig> all have a level of protein abundance similar to the wildtype  and mutant ape2-l <dig> shows significantly reduced expression as expected. mutant ape2-l <dig>  which was expected to have reduced protein abundance as a consequence of reduced splicing efficiency, is expressed at the same level as the wildtype. also, mutant ape2-s <dig> has reduced splicing despite the fact that it has a similar distribution of structural branchpoint distances as the wildtype intron. since this mutant has the mutation at the same location as ape2-l <dig> , it is possible that the intron segment that we mutated was important for splicing . overall, the results for ape <dig> mutants support our hypothesis of the role of structural branchpoint distance in gene splicing.

shortening of branchpoint distances by zipper stems
the splicing efficiency study of rps17b, rps6b and ape <dig> genes containing wildtype and mutant introns supports our hypothesis that short structural branchpoint distances are required for efficient splicing. although these distances are computed in the context of the secondary structure of the entire intron, our hypothesis is still consistent with the original hypothesis  <cit>  that attributes the shortening of a long branchpoint distance to a single stem. such stems, which we will refer to as 'zipper' stems, since they 'zip' the intron, are probably essential for achieving a short structural branchpoint distance. if we analyze the computed secondary structures of the rps17b, rps6b and ape <dig> wildtype introns we can easily identify stable stems whose 3' and 5' constituents are close to the donor site and the branchpoint sequence . the zipper stem labeled in the rps17b intron is the same as the one identified in  <cit>  using experimental structure probing.

to further test the functional importance of the identified zipper stems we performed comparative structure analysis using several closely related yeast species . we used multiple sequence alignments to extract the orthologous intron sequences for our three genes  <cit> . both rps17b and rps6b intron alignments contain three sensu stricto sequences. the multiple sequence alignment for ape <dig> contains all four sequences; however, these are not intronic sequences but sequences from the exon  <dig> of the ape <dig> gene. this error is due to the old s. cerevisiae annotation which mapped two genes to the location of the current ape <dig> gene  <cit> .

we computed the consensus structure of rps17b and rps6b introns using alifold  <cit> . the previously indicated zipper stems were found in the consensus structures for both genes , thus suggesting evolutionary conservation of these structural elements.

discussion
the hypothesis that secondary structure interactions within yeast introns are needed for efficient splicing was proposed two decades ago  <cit> . since then, experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis was found for several of s. cerevisiae's introns  <cit> . these studies identified complementary segments located downstream of the donor site and upstream of the branchpoint sequence whose base-pairing interactions are essential for splicing. it is conjectured that the function of the formed stem is to bring the donor site and the branchpoint sequence closer together so that they are in optimal alignment for spliceosome assembly.

in this paper we use computational rna secondary structure prediction to study structural requirements for efficient splicing in yeast. our approach considers a representative sample of suboptimal structures with free energies close to the mfe and it also considers the entire secondary structure of an intron, rather than a single stem, both of which are more consistent with the nature of rna molecules. furthermore, the approach includes a calculation of the structural branchpoint distance, which is used to quantify the effect of the secondary structure on the distance between the donor site and the branchpoint sequence and can easily be correlated with splicing efficiency measurements. using this method we were able to identify structural characteristics of the rps17b intron and its mutants that seem to be responsible for their splicing differences. notably, mutants that are likely to have a short structural branchpoint distance are spliced more efficiently.

based on our model of structural requirements for efficient splicing we computationally designed intron mutants for three s. cerevisiae genes, rps17b, rps6b and ape <dig>  and experimentally tested their splicing efficiency. the results were mostly consistent with our model, with a few exceptions  which may be due to some structural characteristics of mutants that are not considered by the current model or some inherent approximations in the model that are discussed below. some of the intron mutants that were designed to have different structural characteristics and splicing efficiencies have mutations at the same locations . the experimental results that confirm differences in splicing between these pairs of mutants indicate that the secondary structure of a pre-mrna, rather than the underlying primary sequence, is responsible for differences in splicing.

we also tested our model on the yra <dig> gene intron, whose splicing efficiency had previously been studied by preker and guthrie  <cit> . the published experimental results were in agreement with our model; the efficiently spliced mutants  had higher base-pair probabilities than the poorly spliced sequences  .

our current model is simplified in the sense that the secondary structure of an intron is computed disregarding its flanking sequences, and the three dimensional branchpoint distance is estimated from secondary structure interactions. however, we believe that folding intronic sequences in isolation is appropriate, partly because of the existence of co-transcriptional splicing, where splicing occurs before the entire pre-mrna has been synthesized  <cit> . therefore, the precise part of the pre-mrna that serves as the splicing substrate is not known. the region upstream of the transcribed intron, which consists of the 5' utr and the first exon, is also not precisely defined due to the fact that the transcription start sites have not been unambiguously mapped  <cit> . in addition, 5'utrs are known to associate with a number of protein factors  <cit>  which are likely to have an effect on the structure formation, but these interactions are not currently modelled by computational rna secondary structure approaches. a preliminary investigation, in which we considered some of the upstream region yielded inconclusive results . thus, we believe that folding only intronic sequences gives us a reasonable approximation of the secondary structure of an intron at the time of the splicing reaction.

the approximation of the three dimensional branchpoint distance using pre-mrna secondary structure is necessary since there are no reasonably reliable algorithms for predicting rna tertiary structure. however, it is believed that rna secondary structure plays a crucial role in tertiary structure formation, since most tertiary interactions are thought to arise after the formation of a stable secondary structure, when the molecule is able to bend around the flexible, single-stranded regions  <cit> . moreover, the tertiary structure interactions that arise in the later stages of folding are usually too weak to disrupt secondary structure that has already formed. therefore, we believe that the structural branchpoint distance based on the secondary structure interactions provides a reasonable approximation of the true spatial distance.

CONCLUSIONS
our computational study offers further insights into the role of pre-mrna secondary structure in gene splicing in yeast. we show that it is necessary to consider near-optimal structure predictions to be able to detect structural differences between intron mutants that have different splicing efficiencies. we also propose a novel method for quantifying a distance between two bases in an rna secondary structure and apply this to compute structural branchpoint distances in the studied intron mutants. positive experimental results on three different yeast genes suggest that our model of structural requirements for efficient splicing can be applied universally to all 5'l yeast introns. additional laboratory experiments are needed to refine the current model by determining the upper bound of the structural branchpoint distance needed for efficient splicing and acceptable thermodynamic stability of the stems adjacent to splicing signals. considering that several biological studies indicate that shortening of the branchpoint distance, either by formation of secondary structure or by protein interactions, is important for efficient splicing in drosophila melanogaster and some mammalian species  <cit> , it might be possible to extend our model to define structural requirements for efficient splicing in other eukaryotes. another possible application of our findings is in gene-finding, where structural characteristics of identified long introns can be used to distinguish between real and false positive predictions.
