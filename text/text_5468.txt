BACKGROUND
laccases  are extracellular, multicopper oxidases widely distributed in fungi, higher plants, bacteria, lichens and insects  <cit> . they contain a t <dig> copper atom at which the reducing substrate is oxidized and a trinuclear copper cluster at which oxygen is reduced to water  <cit> . laccases are able to oxidize a broad range of phenolic and non-phenolic compounds expanding further its broad substrate specificity through the inclusion of redox mediators from natural or artificial sources  <cit> . the physiological roles of laccases are diverse and depend on their origin. in plants, these enzymes seem to be involved in wound response, fruiting body formation, cell-wall reconstitution and synthesis of lignin  <cit> . role attributes for bacterial laccases cover copper homeostasis, morphogenesis and pigmentation of spores to confer resistance to stress factors  <cit> . in fungi, laccases carry out a variety of physiological roles including morphogenesis, fungal plant-pathogen/host interaction and lignin mineralization  <cit> . among fungal laccases, those produced by the basidiomycete white-rot fungi are of great biotechnological interest due to their higher redox potential at the t <dig> site  <cit> . thus, high-redox potential laccases  find applications in the production of second generation biofuels, pulp-kraft biobleaching, bioremediation, organic syntheses and the development of biosensors and miniature biofuel cells for medical uses  <cit> .

over  <dig> fungal laccases have been heterologously expressed in the yeasts pichia pastoris and saccharomyces cerevisiae for different purposes  <cit> . in general terms, both organisms are suitable for the expression of eukaryotic genes. these hosts are easy to manipulate due to the availability of a large set of molecular biology tools; besides, they have the ability to perform post-translational modifications  readily secreting active enzymes to the culture broth  <cit> . particularly, s. cerevisiae arise a great interest in synthetic biology and protein engineering by directed evolution  <cit> . with a sophisticated eukaryotic device supported by a high frequency of homologous dna recombination, the construction of complex metabolic pathways by in vivo splicing expression cassettes and/or the directed evolution of cumbersome systems  are simply performed  <cit> . indeed, the battery of reliable in vivo recombination methods based on s. cerevisiae physiology make this budding yeast a powerful cell factory for plenty of potential applications  <cit> . despite these advantages, the practical use of s. cerevisiae in different industrial settings is limited by its rather low secretion levels  <cit> . although the methylotrophic yeast p. pastoris is not the favorite host for directed evolution experiments   <cit> , it does show some attractive features which may complement s. cerevisiae in the synthetic evolutionary scenario: specifically, the ability to grow at very high cell densities under the control of strong promoters and secrete high amounts of protein  <cit> . even though the expression levels reported for recombinant fungal laccases in these yeasts are diverse , overall they are much higher in p. pastoris, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> mg/l  <cit> , than in s. cerevisiae, where they vary from  <dig> to  <dig> mg/l  <cit> .

in a previous work we tackled the directed evolution of the hrpl from the white-rot fungus pm <dig> strain cect  <dig> to be secreted in s. cerevisiae   <cit> . this evolved pm <dig> laccase was recently tailored to be active in human blood   <cit> . hrpls are strongly inhibited by modest concentrations of oh- and cl-, which tightly bind to the catalytic copper centers interrupting the catalysis. to surpass such inhibition, several rounds of laboratory evolution in combination with semi-rational approaches were carried out using a screening assay based on the biochemical composition of human blood. here, we describe the cloning and over-expression of this blood tolerant laccase in p. pastoris. the recombinant enzyme was tested with different promoters and fermentation conditions. the fermentation of the best construct was scaled up in a 42l-bioreactor to 20l fermentation volume, purified, and biochemically characterized. laccase properties were compared to those obtained for the same mutant enzyme expressed by s. cerevisiae.

RESULTS
heterologous functional expression of blood tolerant laccases in p. pastoris
the departure point of the present study is a thermostable laccase from basidiomycete pm <dig>  which was first subjected to  <dig> generations of in vitro evolution for functional expression in s. cerevisiae <cit>  and thereafter to  <dig> further cycles of evolution to become active in human blood  <cit> . the final variant of this process  is formed by the α-factor prepro-leader plus the mature laccase. the chu-b whole fusion gene harbours  <dig> mutations . beneficial mutations enhancing functional expression or activity are both located in the signal sequence  and in the mature protein . besides, the mature protein presents two mutations, f396i and f454e, placed at the second coordination sphere of the t <dig> cu, which are responsible for the activity shown in human blood .

to test chu-b expression levels in p. pastoris, four different constructs were built, including native and evolved α-factor prepro-leaders in combination with two expression vectors: ppiczαa under the control of the methanol inducible alcohol oxidase promoter  and pgapzαa under the control of the constitutive glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter  . transformed clones were pre-screened for laccase expression on agar plates supplemented with abts, resulting in all four cases in a green halo around the colonies due to substrate oxidation by laccase. the apparent most active clones were further subjected to microtiter fermentations . of this set of experiments, paox <dig> clones showed the highest abts-activity and they were subjected to small scale fed-batch fermentation . laccase activity was c.a.  <dig> -fold higher for the construct containing the evolved prepro-leader . accordingly, production of the construct with the evolved prepro-leader was scaled up in a 20-l fermentation. the maximum volumetric activity was reached after  <dig> h . cultivation was not stopped at this time since wet biomass was still increasing and we could expect higher amounts of enzyme to be secreted. unfortunately, laccase activity diminished to  <dig> abts-u/l at harvesting time , an effect that may be ascribed to proteolytic degradation by released intracellular proteases, figure 3c  <cit> . under these conditions, the final laccase production was  <dig> mg/l. this was  <dig> -fold higher than that obtained in shake-flask cultures of s. cerevisiae ; the latter cannot yield the high cell density levels of p. pastoris <cit> , which precludes its use in bioreactor  <cit> . compared to other basidiomycete laccases secreted by p. pastoris, the chu-b secretion was 9-, 5- and  <dig> -fold higher than those of laccases from pleurotus sajor-caju, pycnoporus cinnabarinus and trametes trogii, respectively, and very similar to that of the trametes sp. ah28- <dig> laccase. the production yields achieved with the laccase from trametes sp.  <dig> and the ascomycete botrytis aclada laccase were much higher .

biochemical characterization
glycosylation and thermostability
the chu-b laccase produced in p. pastoris was purified by three chromatographic steps resulting in a homogeneous sample, which was compared with the purified counterpart from s. cerevisiae <cit> . the molecular mass deduced from sds-page was ~ <dig> kda for the enzyme secreted by p. pastoris and s. cerevisiae, figure 4a. the maldi-tof  mass spectrometry analysis allowed a more accurate estimation of molecular masses . from the molecular mass determined using the amino acid composition , glycosylation patterns of 16% and 12% for the laccase from p. pastoris and s. cerevisiae were calculated . unlike s. cerevisiae, whose tendency to add in high extent mannose moieties at the golgi compartment led to hyper-glycosylated heterologous proteins, p. pastoris is known to introduce outer sugar chains to a lesser extent   <cit> . these results address a longer residence time at the golgi of chu-b mutant in p. pastoris than in s. cerevisiae. comparing our data with other hrpls expressed in p. pastoris, the degree of glycosylation is similar to that of the highly related t. trogii laccase  but much lower than that of the hyper-glycosylated p. cinnabarinus laccase , which probably has to face several bottlenecks during exocytosis .

kinetic thermostability was determined by measuring the t <dig> . in spite of the fact that hyper-glycosylation is generally reported to confer higher thermostability  <cit> , the t <dig> of the laccase variant produced in p. pastoris was ~6°c behind its counterpart from s. cerevisiae, table  <dig>  only the careful examination of thermodynamic stability could give us new clues about whether the laccase overglycosylation in p. pastoris is affecting the protein folding and stability.

n-terminal end
we recently reported an extra n-terminal extension of six amino acids in our evolved laccase, as consequence of an alternative processing at the golgi compartment. it was concluded that this extra tail was beneficial for secretion without jeopardizing the biochemical laccase properties  <cit> . in order to know whether similar processing takes place in p. pastoris, chu-b was subjected to end-terminal sequencing. indeed, the same n-terminal extension eteaef was detected in the mature protein revealing the lack of sufficient amount of ste <dig> protease in p. pastoris for a correct cleavage of the α-factor pro-leader. our results are in good agreement with several studies in which ste <dig> was not capable of processing the high levels of α-factor prepro-leaders fusion genes, resulting in an extra n-terminal tail linked to the mature protein  <cit> .

evolved properties of chu-b laccase
ph activity profiles
hrpls are fully inactive at neutral or basic phs due to a reversible oh- inhibition process. one of the most remarkable improvements of chu-b mutant after directed evolution was the shift in the ph activity profile towards the neutral-alkaline side . chu-b produced by s. cerevisiae retained ~20% and ~10% of its initial activity at physiological ph with dmp and abts as substrates, respectively, whereas the activity of parent type  at this ph was negligible  <cit> . almost identical ph activity shapes  were detected with independency of the producing yeast indicating that this important acquired feature was also shown by the mutant expressed in p. pastoris . even though the ph profile was shifted , as occurs for the rest of fungal laccases a bell shaped profile was observed for the phenolic substrate dmp, which is the result of two opposite effects:  activation in the acidic range due to higher redox potential difference between the phenol and the t <dig> cu  and  inactivation at alkaline ph due to the accumulation of oh-, which bind to the t <dig> site interrupting the internal electron transfer from the t <dig> to the t2/t <dig> centers  <cit> . concerning the non-phenolic substrate abts, the ph activity profile showed the expected monotonic shape as the oxidation of this compound does not include proton exchange and the only effect involved is the inhibition by oh-.

inhibition by halides
hrpls are strongly inhibited by the presence of modest concentrations of halides   <cit> . therefore, the use of hrpls in miniature biofuel cells operative in mammal physiological fluids  is limited, on the one hand by the negligible activity at neutral-alkaline ph, and on the other, by the low laccase tolerance against cl-. the chu-b mutant greatly surpassed the halide inhibition by directed evolution and this important property was checked in the variant expressed by p. pastoris. the i <dig> values  were determined at acidic and physiological ph using abts and dmp as substrates. whilst the i50cl- of parent type  was  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm for abts and dmp at acidic ph, respectively, these values were risen up in the chu-b variant from s. cerevisiae to  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm for these substrates. additionally, a slight increase in the i50f- value for both substrates at acidic ph was also observed   <cit> . these improved i50f- and i50cl- were maintained in the mutant expressed in p. pastoris being similar in both yeasts , table  <dig>  figure 5a, b. since the smaller the ionic diameter of the halide the easier the access to the t2/t <dig> trinuclear copper cluster  <cit> , an inhibition potency f->cl- was observed with independence of the substrate tested, table  <dig>  figure 5a, b. when halide inhibition was measured at physiological ph, the enzyme expressed in both yeasts showed i50f- which rose from the μm range at acid ph to the mm range at blood ph, figure 5a. moreover, laccase activity was not affected by increasing concentrations of cl- . this data is consistent with the described effect by which the halide inhibition of laccase activity is weaker at alkaline ph values. under such conditions, the presence of a deprotonated water molecule coordinating the t <dig> cu results in a competition with the halide for binding to the t <dig> site  <cit> .

n.m. non-measurable. inhibition studies were performed at the optimum ph activity value for each substrate tested  and at physiological ph  with abts as reducing substrate.

kinetics
kinetics parameters were measured for phenolic and non-phenolic substrates at optimum and physiological ph . the km for abts and dmp was similar for the laccase produced either by s. cerevisiae or p. pastoris. by contrast, the kcat values for the two substrates were around  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold higher for the laccase from s. cerevisiae than those of the laccase from p. pastoris. possibly, the detected glycosylation differences between both laccases are in part responsible for this effect. further crystallization studies along with computational analysis would be important to clarify the differences in kcat values and thermostabilities  <cit> . when comparing kinetics with the original parent type expressed in s. cerevisiae <cit> , the km at acidic ph was increased around 4- and 14-fold whereas the kcat was ~ <dig> - and 7-fold lower than those of the parental type, for abts and dmp respectively. mutations f396i and f454e, both located at the second coordination sphere of the t <dig> cu, enabled the enzyme to be active under physiological conditions albeit at the cost of catalytic efficiency . the activity of chu-b from p. pastoris in physiological fluids was determined by measuring the oxygen consumption in human plasma and blood. comparable responses for both human fluids were obtained . since for the application of this enzyme in 3d-nanodevices working in physiological conditions, the laccase is directly connected to the cathode of a biofuel cell, the reducing substrates are replaced by a direct electronic current from the anode, which is the rate limiting step in the catalytic mechanism. in fact, chu-b is functional in blood because of the slowed down kinetics. as we have recently reported, the modification of the second coordination sphere of the t <dig> cu comes at the cost of reducing the activity at acidic values, which simultaneously compensates for t <dig> cu inhibition activating chu-b in the presence of halides and oh- <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the blood tolerant laccase engineered by laboratory evolution in s. cerevisiae is easily secreted in p. pastoris with higher production yields whilst maintaining its evolved properties in terms of halide tolerance and ph activity profiles. these results support the use of s. cerevisiae as the preferred host to evolve ligninolytic enzymes and p. pastoris to over-express them for different purposes. indeed, the application of this tandem-yeast evolution/expression system can be extended from laccases to other ligninolytic oxidoreductases  whose engineering for challenging biocatalytic applications are currently pursued by many research groups.
