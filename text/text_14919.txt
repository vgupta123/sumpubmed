BACKGROUND
the region surrounding the town of churchill, manitoba, lies at the intersection of the tundra and boreal forest biomes, making it an ideal site for investigating ecotone biodiversity. previous studies of hymenopteran subtaxa  <cit>  and aquatic insects  <cit>  have increased previous species richness estimates for this region by integrating morphological and molecular methods for species delimitation.

members of the order hymenoptera include pollinators, other herbivores, parasitoids, hyperparasitoids, predators, cleptoparasites, inquilines, and omnivores  <cit> , so hymenopteran species play multiple and complex roles in terrestrial food webs. however, accurate characterization of trophic interactions is impossible without a better understanding of community biodiversity. indeed, a historic underestimation of biodiversity has undoubtedly hampered our understanding of arctic food webs  <cit> , while integrative approaches reveal previously unsuspected cryptic diversity within parasitoid-host systems  <cit> .

by most measures, biodiversity gradients generally show higher species richness at lower latitudes, but parasitoid hymenoptera have been a commonly noted exception in some earlier literature, at least in comparisons of tropical vs. temperate regions  <cit> . other studies suggest that this conclusion is incorrect, arguing that it is an artifact created by errors of scale  <cit> , overrepresentation of some study locations  <cit> , inconspicuousness or low abundance of some taxa  <cit> , incomplete or inconsistent sampling methods  <cit> , and even a latitudinal bias in incorrect taxonomy  <cit> .

the general pattern of reduced biodiversity at high latitudes has been attributed to harsh climate  <cit> , slower evolutionary rates due to long generation times  <cit> , loss of populations via drift or inbreeding depression  <cit> , and geographic/geological barriers to colonization  <cit> . at the same time, other studies have found higher-than-expected diversity among arctic and sub-arctic hymenoptera, both at our study site and in similar environments. for example, a recent study of the boreal and arctic microgastrinae  increased by 50% the estimate of species richness for this subfamily in canada and alaska  <cit> .

in the context of sub-arctic insect ecology, “expected” biodiversity is difficult to define. for example, anthropogenic climate change may disproportionately affect high-latitude regions  <cit> , making older diversity estimates obsolete. molecular methods for quantifying species richness typically exceed estimates made via morphology alone, because molecular methods both reveal cryptic species and permit inclusion of specimens that would otherwise remain unidentified  <cit> . comparisons among regions should be testable via independent genetic and morphological evidence, but the large scale of most ecological surveys make it impractical either to examine visible characteristics or to sequence multiple genes from every specimen  <cit> .

we here report both the observed diversity and the estimated richness for both parasitoid and non-parasitoid hymenoptera of the churchill region, using abundance-based data from a comprehensive collection made between  <dig> and  <dig>  we also assessed similarity of assemblages among local collection sites, using incidence-based data from a subset of specimens collected during the  <dig> season. our species counts and estimates are based on dna barcodes  <cit> , which we assigned to molecular operational taxonomic units   <cit> . we used these data to construct rarefaction curves, investigate diversity of subtaxa, and estimate species richness for hymenoptera of the churchill region. this approach has several advantages. first, it provides a proxy for species-level determinations, which were not available for the entire collection . second, it reveals suspected cryptic species that can be further studied and eventually described if their existence is supported via integrative methods  <cit> . third, this approach can be standardized, which will make it easier for future researchers to compare results among similar regional diversity studies.

we discuss our results in the context of overall hymenopteran diversity, the composition of different feeding guilds, and the potential of our approach to inform future studies of arctic and sub-arctic insect communities.

RESULTS
motu counts
for the overall churchill collection , motu counts calculated with jmotu ranged from a high of  <dig>  to a low of  <dig> . for the churchill  <dig> subcollection, motu counts ranged from a high of  <dig>  to a low of  <dig> . the overall churchill collection and the  <dig> subcollection are described in more detail in the methods section. for brevity, we report remaining results for only the 2% cutoff unless otherwise specified.

in the overall collection, we resolved  <dig> motus at the 2% cutoff level. the families represented by the most individuals – ichneumonidae  and braconidae  – were also the most diverse. we resolved  <dig> motus for ichneumonidae and  <dig> motus for braconidae. the dominance of these two families was also evident in the  <dig> subcollection, for which we resolved  <dig> motus at the 2% cutoff level. this subcollection included  <dig> ichneumonids  and  <dig> braconids . ichneumonoids made up 78% of the specimens in the full collection and 83% of the  <dig> subcollection. ichneumonoid motus also made up 75%  of overall motus and 81%  of the subcollection motus.

along with the ichneumonoidea, other parasitoids dominated the collection. the superfamily chalcidoidea accounted for  <dig> individuals  in the overall collection and  <dig> individuals  in the  <dig> subcollection. the most diverse taxon outside the ichneumonoidea and chalcidoidea was another parasitoid family – the family diapriidae , with  <dig> individuals  in the overall collection and  <dig> individuals  in the  <dig> subcollection.

among non-parasitoids, the most numerous and diverse family was the tenthredinidae, with  <dig> individuals  in the overall collection and  <dig> individuals  in the  <dig> subcollection. this family accounted for all of the symphyta in the churchill collection, except for seven individuals of a single species  of the family cimbicidae , which were present in the overall collection.

full specimen and motu counts for all represented families and/or superfamilies of hymenoptera are summarized in table  <dig> 

accumulation/rarefaction curves and richness estimates
rarefaction curves for the complete churchill collection and the  <dig> subcollection are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  neither set of curves approaches an asymptote at the point where all individuals  or samples  are included.

for the overall collection, the chao  <dig> richness estimate  <cit>  was  <dig>  with a 95% ci range of  <dig> through  <dig>  for the  <dig> subcollection, the chao  <dig> richness estimate  <cit>  was  <dig>  with a 95% ci range of  <dig> through  <dig>  additional results for cutoff ranges from 1% through 3% are shown in table  <dig> 

upper table: entire churchill hymenoptera collection . lower table: churchill  <dig> subcollection .

species similarity among sites
sobs  <cit>  for each of the  <dig> sites in the  <dig> subcollection ranged from a low of  <dig>  to a high of  <dig> . the largest estimated shared species value was  <dig>  between sites  <dig> and  <dig> , and the smallest was one, between sites  <dig> and  <dig> .

the highest value of the chao-sørensen-est abundance-based similarity index  <cit>  between any two sites was  <dig> , between sites  <dig> and  <dig> . the lowest similarity index was  <dig> , between sites  <dig> and  <dig> . there was no significant correlation between similarity index and the distance between sites .

full results  for shared species and similarity are included in additional file  <dig>  because sobs for each site includes motus shared with other sites, the sobs values for the  <dig> sites do not sum to the total sobs for the  <dig> subcollection.

proportional contribution of taxa and feeding guilds
relative contributions to overall motu diversity within the overall churchill collection are shown in figure  <dig>  and figure  <dig> . these proportions remained similar throughout the 1-3% sequence divergence cutoff ranges for motu assignments. proportions for the churchill  <dig> subcollection were similar to those for the overall collection .

discussion
species identification and delimitation
the  <dig> specimens from the churchill collection were assigned to  <dig> motus at the 2% cutoff range. on average, we identified a different species for every  <dig>  individuals sampled . most motu were sparsely represented, with a mode of  <dig>  and a median of  <dig>  only  <dig> motus included  <dig> or more individuals, and only three of these included  <dig> or more . for the churchill  <dig> subcollection, there were  <dig> motus, and the mean number of individuals per motu was  <dig>  . singleton motus made up a similar proportion of the  <dig> subcollection as they did of the parent collection .

based on number of motus, the most diverse families in the overall churchill collection were the ichneumonidae , braconidae , diapriidae  and tenthredinidae . all of these families except the diapriidae included some specimens that had been previously identified below the family level. we also resolved  <dig> motus among the chalcidoidea, which were not determined to family. each of the other taxonomic groups in this study, including the entire superfamily cynipoidea, yielded fewer than  <dig> motus.

as determined by traditional morphological taxonomy, the  <dig> specimens of ichneumonidae in the overall collection encompassed at least  <dig> subfamilies,  <dig> genera, and  <dig> species. however,  <dig> individuals  carried no identification below the family level. at the 2% cutoff level,  <dig> motus were resolved for this family; if this cutoff level provides a good approximation to interspecific divergence in ichneumonidae, then morphological examination previously resolved only  <dig> % of the diversity present. similarly, for  <dig> specimens of braconidae,  <dig> % had no identification below the family level and the number of resolved species was only  <dig> % of the motu total. for  <dig> tenthredinidae specimens,  <dig> % had no identification below the family level, and the resolved species count was  <dig> % of the motu total.

these values should be considered approximations, for several reasons. first, no single motu cutoff level can definitively delimit all species; the 2% cutoff level for motu definition is known to be insufficiently stringent for some hymenopteran subtaxa and too stringent for others  <cit> . second, even the better-identified families in this collection have not to date received the same amount of scrutiny by morphological taxonomists, and the most completely determined taxa as of may  <dig>  made up only a small proportion of the collection.

the second issue – unequal attention given to different taxa – is not a trivial one, because full morphological species identification requires considerable effort and expertise, and identifying a diverse collection requires a diverse assemblage of specialists. the low rate of morphological specimen identification says little about the ability of taxonomists to identify a specimen in hand, but much about the difficulty of placing every specimen from a large survey into the hands of the appropriate specialist  <cit> . specimens from this study may receive more attention from specialists in the future, and the availability of dna barcodes will make it easier for taxonomists to delimit and perhaps even describe species in this collection via integrative methods  <cit> .

rarefaction and richness estimates
rarefaction/accumulation curves show no clear approach to asymptotes for either the complete churchill collection  or the  <dig> subcollection  the chao  <dig> richness estimate at 2% cutoff is  <dig> motus, with a 95% ci of  <dig> through  <dig>  by this estimate, the  <dig> motus defined from our collection cover approximately 62% ± 5% of total richness. since this estimate was based on motus rather than on morphological determinations, it is independent of the amount of attention each subtaxon received from a morphological taxonomist. it should still be considered exploratory, because we did not sequence every one of the many thousands of individual specimens originally collected, and because the overall collection was not controlled for variation in sampling effort at different locations throughout the collection range.

abundance-based measures may also be biased by over- or under-representation of some species independent of site selection or sampling effort. for example, our collection contained social insects  that can be oversampled when traps are set near nests or other sites of high colony activity. as individual specimens, social hymenoptera were among the most abundant members of the collection, but also among the least diverse, and this was verified by both sequence data and morphological examination. ants comprised  <dig> motus, including camponotus herculaneus , two apparently distinct members of the formica fusca complex  one species of myrmica  and up to three members of the genus leptothorax . similarly, the collection included seven identified species of bombus whose sample sizes ranged from a minimum of two  to a maximum of  <dig> , and which formed eight motus . three species of vespinae were also present, with sample sizes ranging from eight  to  <dig> . vespine wasps were assigned to three motus that were congruent with morphological identifications.

similarity among sites
for the  <dig> subcollection, values of the chao-sørensen-est abundance-based similarity index were highly variable among different site pairs, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . however, these values were not significantly correlated with the linear distances between site pairs .

almost all specimens in the hymenoptera collection were of winged insects or their larvae, and we expect these species to disperse widely among sites. the only exceptions were worker ants and female dryinidae; however, since ant reproductives and male dryinids are winged, these species can still disperse via flight. the wide range of between-site similarities could be related to microhabitat differences, variation among sampling methods, or sampling at different times throughout the season. for example, even in the short sub-arctic summer, the trichoptera of the churchill region show some seasonal variation in species presence and abundance  <cit> , and this may be true of hymenoptera as well. the chao-sørensen-est similarity model should mitigate some of these effects, since it includes an estimate of unseen species and also accounts for sample size difference . whether or not methodological or microhabitat differences affected incidence or abundance measures of some motus, the  <dig> subcollection showed no evidence for distance-dependent substructure across the study area.

feeding ecology and the importance of parasitoids
the hymenopteran fauna of the churchill region is dominated by parasitoids, and the parasitoid fauna of churchill is dominated by the ichneumonoidea . we observed this pattern not only in the overall collection, but also in the  <dig> subcollection, in which specimens were deliberately selected for inclusion by a method designed to maximize taxonomic breadth.

worldwide, the ichneumonidae and braconidae are thought to be the first and second most diverse families of hymenoptera  <cit> , so this result is not unexpected in any regional survey of the order. only about 12% of identified parasitoid motus were non-ichneumonoids, but these represented at least six different hymenopteran superfamilies, including members of the families diapriidae , dryinidae , megaspilidae , platygastridae , proctotrupidae , plus multiple families of chalcidoidea.

still, parasitoids cannot reproduce without hosts, so the diversity of parasitoids in this sub-arctic location implies a high level of host diversity. many members of the superfamily ichneumonoidea are parasitoids of immature lepidoptera, but they also parasitize hosts from other holometabolous orders, nymphal hemimetabola, and arachnids  <cit> . at least four ichneumonid subfamilies  target sawflies, and others  include hyperparasitoids. non-ichneumonoid parasitoids can also exploit a wide range of hosts, including diptera , hemiptera , and the variety of hosts that are susceptible to attack by chalcidoidea  <cit> . a more detailed list of churchill parasitoid subtaxa and their presumed hosts is included in additional file  <dig> 

parallel studies of the churchill fauna reveal no shortage of potential hosts. our hymenoptera collection includes more than  <dig> presumed species of tenthredinoid sawflies. the comprehensive churchill terrestrial arthropod collection includes approximately  <dig> species of diptera,  <dig> of lepidoptera,  <dig> of coleoptera,  <dig> of hemiptera, and  <dig> of araneae . these numbers are probably conservative, since they are based on observed motu or species richness rather than on extrapolated richness. if true species richness of these other orders is similar to that of hymenoptera , then we would expect that more than  <dig> species from these groups are potential hosts for hymenopteran parasitoids in the churchill region. details of host-parasitoid interactions are far beyond the scope of this survey, so we cannot tell whether some parasitoids attack multiple hosts, or whether some hosts are attacked by multiple parasitoids. however, dna barcode data can provide the earliest clues to the presence of cryptic host-parasitoid interactions that can be targeted for future taxonomic and ecological study  <cit> .

non-parasitoids in this collection were dominated by obligate herbivores, including bees  and sawflies . predators were much less diverse . other aculeates included chrysididae  and formicidae . the chrysidids – all members of the cleptoparasitic subfamily chrysidinae – are likely to invade nests of host taxa that were represented in this collection  <cit> . one chrysidine, omalus aeneus, is a known cleptoparasite in nests of pemphredon spp. , a genus represented by two individuals in the overall collection. the other chrysidines were not identified to species, but some nearctic chrysidines are specialized cleptoparasites of the cavity nests of eumenine vespids  <cit> . the overall collection contained three determined species of cavity-nesting eumeninae: ancistrocerus albophaleratus, a. waldenii, and euodynerus leucomelas <cit> .

geography and climate
some previous surveys of regional ichneumonid fauna showed an unusual pattern – a higher diversity of ichneumonidae  in some temperate regions than in the tropics  <cit> . however, this conclusion has been challenged  <cit> , because in practice, it is difficult to design and implement a sampling protocol free of methodological bias. as a result, spurious patterns of diversity can be traced to over- or under-sampling of some subtaxa or habitats that share characteristics other than latitude  <cit> . some of these factors are additionally complicated by uncertain taxonomy. for example, molecular evidence may reveal that some “generalist” parasitoid species are actually made up of multiple cryptic species with more narrow host specializations than previously recognized  <cit> .

these issues make it difficult to define a priori expectations of parasitoid diversity in a sub-arctic environment, and to compare it with diversity at other latitudes. for example, the earliest descriptions of anomalous latitudinal gradients in parasitoid diversity pre-date the routine use of both large-scale trapping  <cit>  and molecular methods  <cit>  in biodiversity research. the motu approach is not always sufficient for species delimitation, and is not sufficient to describe new species, but it has the advantage of being quantitative, reproducible, and feasible even when morphological determinations are impractical  <cit> . as such, barcode-based diversity studies can reveal large-scale geographic or ecological patterns of cryptic diversity, and can also identify specific taxa in need of further study by specialist taxonomists or conservation biologists.

CONCLUSIONS
the temptation to describe a regional fauna as unexpectedly diverse is often high, especially in surveys of extreme environments. the resolution of more than  <dig> species of hymenoptera in the churchill region provides just such a case, because of both the harshness of this environment and the dominance of parasitoids. the success of parasitoids is in turn a clue to the previously unexplored diversity of their hosts, especially other holometabola.

full species delimitation and description require more detail than dna barcoding alone can provide; these are questions best answered by integrative methods that incorporate morphology, ecology, and genetics. however, in environments like that of sub-arctic canada – environments disproportionately threatened by climate change – taxonomists and ecologists have the twin additional challenges of limited time and limited resources. it is currently difficult to compare the diversity of this region to either other regions or its own past, because of the varied methods used in historical studies. dna barcoding, combined with permanent curation of the barcoded specimens, provides an avenue for rapid estimation of species richness, as well as an easily standardized method for designing and comparing future studies and prioritizing critical research.
