BACKGROUND
citrus, one of the major fruit tree crops is widely cultivated throughout the globe and therefore has a tremendous economical, social and cultural impact in our society. citrus improvement through traditional techniques, however, is highly impaired due to the unusual combination of biological characteristics of citrus species, their low genetic diversity and the long-term nature of tree breeding. citrus are diploid plants with an estimated haploid genome size of about  <dig> mb and 2n =  <dig> chromosomes, which may facilitate the use of genomics tools for crop improvement. expressed sequence tag  analyses and molecular marker studies strongly suggest that the main commercial citrus cultivars  are mostly interspecific hybrids and therefore are heterozygous "species"  <cit> . in addition, most of the cultivars in these groups, including clementine varieties, may represent accumulated somatic mutations identified over centuries  <cit> .

the development of citrus genomic resources is in its infancy although in recent years major efforts and goals mostly on functional genomics have certainly been undertaken  <cit> . critical functional and expression analyses through microarrays with several platforms have also been published and analyses of ests in public databases have been initiated  <cit> . for instance,  <dig>  citrus ests have been deposited at genbank and are currently available. this collection constitutes a valuable source for the direct access to the genes of interest and for the development of molecular markers for map-based cloning purposes or marker-assisted selection programs  <cit> . moreover, genetic linkage maps have been produced with increasing value and resolution, following the evolution of new marker systems  <cit> . genetic transformation in citrus is also available  <cit>  and strategies based on genome-wide mutagenesis are being explored. other innovative resources such as viral-induced gene silencing  are being developed and work in citrus proteomics is in progress  <cit> . thus, current advances in citrus research include the rapid development of functional genomics and molecular biology resources  <cit>  although, on the other hand, basic information on the organization and structure of citrus genome is lacking. the main challenge for a comprehensive and meaningful description of genomes is the integration of the dna marker-based genetic maps with physical maps, and eventually with dna sequence of the whole genome, the ultimate physical map. for the generation of high-resolution physical maps, the construction of bac libraries containing clones with large dna fragments appears to be indispensable. bac end sequencing is indeed an important component of physical map development and can be considered a form of low coverage sequencing  <cit> . paired end sequences of bacs form an important part of scaffolding whole-genome shotgun programs  <cit>  as well as in bac based genome projects  <cit> . in addition, bac clone collections and bac-based contig maps are powerful tools having multiple applications in genomics including positional cloning. the bac end sequence provides a random survey of the information contents  of unsequenced genomes  <cit> , and yields molecular markers useful for genetic mapping  <cit> , and cloning of genes of agricultural interest  <cit> . furthermore, in many agriculturally important species bac clones and physical maps are being rapidly developed since they are essential components in linking phenotypic traits to the responsible genetic variation, to integrate the genetic data, for the comparative analysis of genomes, and to speed up marker-assisted selection  for breeding. thus, bac libraries have become central for physical mapping, genome analysis, clone based sequencing and sequencing of complex genomes, for both model  <cit>  and main crop plants  <cit> .

in citrus, two bac libraries from poncirus trifoliata  <cit>  and a hybrid of citrus × poncirus  <cit>  have been described in detail. these libraries were constructed as part of a map-based cloning strategy of genes conferring resistance to citrus tristeza virus that causes significant economic damage and losses to citrus worldwide. poncirus is a non domesticated genus related to citrus species that produces inedible fruit. however, other efforts to generate bac citrus resources, for instance in satsuma or sweet orange have also been accomplished  <cit> .

in this work, we report the characterization of three genomic bac libraries from clementine  mandarin, a cultivar of great  <cit> economic importance that has been a main target of recent studies  <cit> . the development of these new genomic tools also complements the functional genomics platform generated for this species including an extensive est collection and a  <dig> k cdna chip  <cit> , expanding further possibilities for isolation of genes of agronomical interest  <cit> . this study provides the most comprehensive, large insert clone resource of any citrus species and reports the analysis of  <dig>  bac end sequences offering a first detailed insight into the sequence composition of the clementine genome. the analyses focused on protein coding regions, repeat element composition, microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism contents. additionally, data on gene homology based comparative genomics with poplar and arabidopsis are also presented. the annotated bac-end sequences may well serve as useful resources for physical mapping, positional cloning, genetic marker development and genome sequencing of c. clementina.

RESULTS
bac library characterization
three genomic bac libraries  were constructed as described in material and methods, with dna from citrus clementina , pebac <dig> as the cloning vector and three different restriction enzymes . the ccl <dig> library composed of  <dig>  clones was generated with mboi partial digestions. ecori and hindiii were used for the construction of ccer <dig> and cch <dig>  respectively, and  <dig>  clones were picked from each one. the three libraries contained  <dig>  bac clones that were arrayed in  <dig> 384-well microtiter plates. it has been reported that the use of three different restriction enzymes resulted in a more accurate coverage of the genomes, since the different gc contents of their recognition sites increases the representation of a higher number of genomic regions  <cit> . a single library constructed with one restriction enzyme usually cannot provide a full coverage of the genome, as the restriction sites are not uniformly distributed along the genome, and therefore genomic regions having too many or too few restriction sites are not equally represented  <cit> . generally, two or more complementary large insert libraries, constructed with different restriction enzymes, have been successfully used for physical mapping of several plant genomes including those of arabidopsis <cit> , japonica rice  <cit> , or soybean  <cit> .

a no bacterial growth detected

b presence of vector but no insert

in order to evaluate the average bac insert size,  <dig> bac clones  were randomly chosen and the corresponding dna was extracted, digested with the rare cutter noti enzyme and analyzed by pfge. all fragments generated by noti digestion contained the  <dig>  kb vector band and various insert fragments . the estimated insert sizes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, with an average of  <dig> kb for ccl <dig>   <dig> kb for cch <dig> and  <dig> kb for ccer <dig>  since the haploid genome size of c. clementina is in the order of  <dig> mb, the libraries coverage is predicted to be  <dig>  haploid genome equivalents while the probability of finding any specific sequence is greater than  <dig> %. it has been estimated that the number of clones representing 10× haploid genomes is adequate for most genome research purposes, including physical mapping  <cit> .

bac end sequencing
a total of  <dig>  bac clones from the three genomic libraries were selected for end sequencing as described in material and methods and out of this number,  <dig>  clones  rendered  <dig>  bac end sequences . the three libraries contributed approximately with similar number of reads. the average read length was  <dig>  bp and the genomic raw sequence produced was  <dig>  mb, which corresponds to almost 8% of the clementine genome. table  <dig> shows a summary of the bac end sequencing features. the  <dig>  bess were deposited at genbank with accession numbers from et <dig> to et <dig>

b genomic equivalents calculated considering the number of clones sequenced and their average length

c reads identified as chloroplastic or mitochondrial dna

d total genomic sequence obtained, without mitochondrial or chloroplastic dna

sequence annotation
chloroplast and mitochondrion dna analysis
in order to identify extranuclear sequences, bes were first compared against the citrus sinensis chloroplastic  <cit>  and the arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  mitochondrial genome sequences with an stringent threshold of 1e- <dig>  the comparison indicated that  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences produced significant matches with the chloroplastic and mitochondrial genomes, respectively. chloroplastic bess were assembled and the consensus sequences obtained spanned  <dig>  bp, approximately 70% of the chloroplast genome. chloroplastic and mitochondrial dna summed up to  <dig> kb, and therefore, the total genomic dna obtained was  <dig>  mb. considering the average size of the bac clones, the coverage provided by the bac end sequencing was higher than  <dig>  genomic equivalents.

repetitive dna analysis
the repetitive dna fraction present in clementine bess revealed with repeatmasker, included  <dig>  interspersed repeats which extended over  <dig>  mb,  <dig> % of the total raw sequence . blastx search performed to identify coding regions , showed that  <dig>  additional sequences not detected by repeatmasker also presented high significant similarity to transposable elements  and, therefore, are also part of the repetitive dna fraction of the genome. thus, the number of bess with interspersed repeats rose to  <dig> , approximately a 25% of the total reads, a percentage between those found for carica papaya   <cit>  or musa acuminata   <cit> . no significant differences between the  <dig> bac libraries were found when the number of bess carrying repetitive elements was compared . the sequence length occupied by transposon elements  including the additional reads identified through homology search was in this way increased to  <dig>  mb, a fraction corresponding to  <dig> % of the total bac end sequences. this fraction was rather similar to the ratio reported for brassica rapa  in an estimation also based on partial sequencing  <cit> . comparisons with the percentages found in fully sequenced genomes showed that the relative occurrence of tes in clementine was also similar to the fractions found in arabidopsis   <cit>  and black cottonwood   <cit>  and lower than in rice   <cit>  and grapevine   <cit> . although the proportion of the different tes largely varied, in all these species, as well as in c. clementina, class i elements  were predominant over class ii . in comparison with the above sequenced plants, the occurrence of mutator-like, lines, cacta, and gypsy elements, represented as the percentage of occupied sequence, was in general lower in the genome of c. clementina. in contrast, copia-like elements were relatively more abundant in clementine than in arabidopsis, rice and poplar . the abundance of these elements in citrus has previously been estimated to be relatively high   <cit> , while the data obtained through partial sequencing in this study suggested a lower preponderance . copia and gypsy like elements, however, are transcriptionally active in clementine  <cit>  and therefore, could be an important source of genetic variability in this species.

in order to identify low complexity repeats, all bess were searched against themselves with blastn and then classified based on the number of significant hits produced . after filtration,  <dig>  bes producing at least one hit different from themselves were clustered in this way. the results showed that while a high proportion of bess  displayed a low number of hits,  <dig>  reads produced more that  <dig> hits, suggesting that these bess may carry non-coding repetitive sequences, i.e. they may be interspersed repeats of lower complexity. the amount of sequence occupied by these repeats was estimated to be  <dig>  mb,  <dig> % of the analyzed sequence. this proportion appears to be moderate in comparison with the  <dig> % figure reported for poplar  <cit> .

analysis of coding regions
after filtration of mitochondrial, chloroplastic and repetitive sequences, the remaining  <dig>  bes were analyzed for coding region identification via homology search. parallel searches with blastx and blastn were performed against the non-redundant database  and a database of citrus ests from genbank , respectively. the blastx search identified  <dig>  bes  with significant protein hits, while the blastn search revealed a similar number of reads, i.e.  <dig>  reads that rendered significant homology with  <dig>  citrus ests. overall,  <dig>  bess produced blastx and/or blasn hits, and the  <dig> bac libraries rendered a similar number of clones carrying potential coding regions . the total number of bac clones that produced protein and/or est hits was  <dig> , while  <dig>  of them provided hits in both 5' and 3' ends, an observation that suggested high gene contents in these bac clones and indeed their possible location at the euchromatin. it was also found that  <dig>  bes produced hits for both proteins and ests, strongly indicating that they contained active transcription units.

assuming that each significant blast hit corresponds to a different transcription unit, the total number of hypothetical genes described in the bac ends was  <dig> . thus, considering the amount of analyzed sequence , the estimated genome size , and the number of genomic equivalents analyzed , the gene contents of the genome of citrus clementina was assessed as  <dig> . this gene number is comparable to the estimate reported for three species of similar genome size that have been sequenced to completion to date: rice , with a genome size of  <dig> mb and  <dig>  genes identified  <cit> , black cottonwood with  <dig>  genes in  <dig> mb  <cit> , and grapevine , with  <dig>  genes in  <dig> mb  <cit> . other estimates based on bes analysis obtained for plant species were also analogous. for instance, in papaya, the estimated gene contents was  <dig>  with a  <dig> mb genome size  <cit> , and in chinese cabbage, with a genome of  <dig> mb,  <dig>  genes were calculated  <cit> .

furthermore, total gc content in bess estimated with emboss was 39% while in coding and non-coding sequences, was 41% and 37%, respectively . no significant differences were found when the gc content was compared between the  <dig> bac libraries constructed . the gc contents reported in other woody plants such as scots pine   <cit>  or yellow-poplar   <cit>  as well as in coding sequences from solanaceae species i.e. nicotiana tabacum , solanum tuberosum , and solanum esculentum , or the fabaceae pisum sativum  were also on the same range. the percentage of gc in glycine max  and a. thaliana  was significantly higher  <cit> .

lastly, blast2go  <cit>  was used to analyze the different functions associated with the putative coding regions, and go terms were assigned to  <dig>  sequences. additional file  <dig> shows the results obtained for the gene ontology categories molecular function and process. this classification may be useful to identify and locate genes of agronomic interest, such as those related to sugar and cellulose synthesis , ion transport , or calcium metabolism , for instance.

ssr analysis
bac end sequences have proved to be excellent sources to identify simple sequence repeats  in many plant species such as cotton or soybean  <cit> . in this work, sputnik  <cit>  was used to identify a total of  <dig>  ssrs longer than  <dig> bp in the bess that did not carry repetitive sequences. the occurrence of ssrs in the clementine genome had a frequency of  <dig>  ssr per kb, a value almost identical to that reported in a study based on citrus ests   <cit>  and in b. rapa   <cit> . this frequency, however, was lower than the ratios found in grapevine   <cit> , papaya   <cit> , and a. thaliana .

in the clementine ssr set, there were  <dig> class i  and  <dig>  class ii  ssrs, with di and trinucloetides accounting for almost 70% of the ssrs, while tetra and pentanucleotides were less represented. in general, those motifs containing a/t nucleotides were far more abundant than g/c rich repeats, specially att/taa and at/ta tri- and dinucleotides . a similar distribution was found by jiang et al <cit>  and chen et al.  <cit>  in the analysis of  <dig>  and  <dig>  citrus ssrs derived from ests, respectively. in the clementine genome, microsatellites were more numerous in non coding sequences  than in putative coding regions , as previously reported in papaya  <cit> , chinese cabbage  <cit> , and arabidopsis <cit> .

microsatellites are co-dominant, highly polymorphic, and simple to use markers that have been successfully used in studies of genetic diversity  <cit>  and genetic mapping in citrus  <cit>  and in many other plants  <cit> . the additional markers reported here will certainly contribute to improve the coverage of the citrus genome for many purposes, including the development of accurate linkage and genetic maps.

contig assembly and snp analysis
assembly of bess that did not contain repetitive sequences was performed with cap <dig>  <cit> , and a total of  <dig>  contigs including  <dig>  reads and covering  <dig>  mb of sequence were produced. it has been suggested that c. clementina is an offspring of a c. sinensis × c. reticulata cross and therefore has a heterozygous genome  <cit> . in order to identify possible polymorphisms affecting the assembly of the readings and the construction of the physical map of this species, a blastn search of all the contigs and singlets was performed against themselves. one hundred thirty sequence pairs that presented a single reciprocal blastn hit and the same protein hit from the previous blastx search  were selected for further analysis. a total of  <dig> pairs displayed sequence identities higher than 90% and were considered as originated from the same genomic region. these sequences were not assembled in the same contig due to the presence of polymorphisms, similarly to what was reported in the sequencing of the highly heterozygous grapevine variety, pinot noir  <cit> .

the contigs generated in the assembly were analyzed in order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the diploid genome of c. clementina. snps are the most abundant and powerful polymorphic markers, since they provide gene-based markers that can be used in the creation of dense genetic linkage maps  <cit>  and, more important, in the identification of genes associated with specific trait loci. bac end sequences of heterozygous genotypes have also been successfully utilized in snp discovery and construction of linkage maps  <cit> . polybayes  <cit> , a software designed to use genomic sequence as a template and base quality values to discern true allelic variations from sequencing errors, was used to reveal snp polymorphisms. the number of putative snps identified in the clementine sequences that showed p ≥  <dig>  and snp depth lower than  <dig> was  <dig> , corresponding to  <dig>  snps per kb. polybayes has been successfully utilized in automated high throughput identification of snps from est collections, and it has been shown that when using p ≥  <dig> , 85% of the predicted snps are generally validated experimentally  <cit> .

in order to test the accuracy of the snp prediction carried out, a total of  <dig> polymorphisms were randomly chosen for experimental validation. primers were designed on the consensus sequence of the contigs, in order to amplify the region containing the snp. out of  <dig> genomic regions,  <dig> produced two or more bands in the pcr amplification or yielded sequence reads with a mixture of templates. this observation constitutes a first indication of the level of heterozygosity of the clementine genome. furthermore, the sequence analysis of the remaining snp candidates showed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> hypothetical polymorphisms, an  <dig> % success rate, were certainly validated . considering the reliability of the prediction method, more than  <dig> putative polymorphisms with p ≥  <dig>  were found in this work. transitions were the most abundant changes , followed by transversions  and indels  . the transition fraction found in poplar  was substantially higher  <cit> . the predominant transversion was a/t at a frequency that doubled that of c/g changes , an unexpected observation that remains to be explained.

it should be noted that the snp listing reported in this work constitutes the first set of putative snps identified in any citrus species, and hence provides a completely new resource for genome analysis in this genera. it is also worth mentioning that  <dig>  snps were located in or close to putative coding regions, and therefore these 'functional snps' may provide an inestimable resource for the identification of genes associated with specific trait loci in addition to their utility as molecular markers for genetic and comparative mapping, nucleotide diversity analysis and association studies.

two heterozygous genomes have been sequenced to completion, the nisqually- <dig> poplar and the pinot noir grapevine strains. in both cases the frequency of polymorphisms found within these heterozygous genomes, was  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  snps per kb, respectively. these rates are in contrast with the frequency of  <dig>  snps per kb found in clementine. the reproductive biology of the different species could explain these differences. gametophytic self- and cross-incompatibility, and apomixy would produce low variability within citrus species  <cit> , while outcrossing by means of insect and wind pollination, which is the norm for poplar and vitis, would result in highly heterozygous cultivars  <cit> .

comparative genomics
the non-repetitive fraction of the bess was also used in a blastn search against the complete nucleotide sequence of the genomes of a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa and o. sativa, with 1e- <dig> as cut off value. the genomic sequences were displayed with chromosomes as single searchable fasta sequences. in order to map the bess unambiguously on the heterologous complete genomes, only those sequences producing single significant hits were taken into account. table  <dig> shows that the populus genome not only yielded the largest number of significant hits , but also spanned more than twice the length of the sequence displaying similarity.

a total length of the aligned regions

the  <dig> bess that produced significant hits with poplar were mapped on the chromosomes of this species. the representation drawn in figure  <dig> showed that citrus sequences were rather uniformly widespread on the  <dig> poplar chromosomes, an observation that can also be deduced from data in table  <dig> that in addition shows that the average number of tags per chromosome was  <dig> while the distance between tags was  <dig> kb. considering that both species have similar genome size, the uniform distribution of the clementine tags on the poplar chromosomes may suggest that the citrus genome is conveniently represented in the bac clone set.

following the approach of lai et al.  <cit> , we used forward and reverse bes read pairs separated by the approximate length of bac clone inserts , to analyze the microsynteny between c. clementina and arabidopsis, rice and poplar. to be considered as potentially collinear with the target genome, the citrus mate pairs had to map in the heterologous genome into a region comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> kb and be also oriented properly. the analyses of the sequences identified  <dig> clementine bac end pairs that met these criteria in poplar, while no one was found in arabidopsis or rice. furthermore, the majority of these bes pairs mapped on the populus genome at a distance similar to the insert size of the clementine libraries, suggesting the microsynteny between citrus and poplar is higher than between citrus and arabidopsis. these results are striking since c. clementina and a. thaliana belong to sapindales and brassicales orders  that probably split approximately  <dig> mya, while p. trichocarpa belongs to malpighiales order,  that diverged from eurosids ii around  <dig> mya  <cit> . moreover, similar results were obtained by lai et al  <cit>  with papaya, that also exhibited higher level of colinearity with the poplar than with the arabidopsis genome despite that c. papaya is a basal member of the brassicales. although a definitive explanation has not been provided yet, it is currently believed that the genome of a. thaliana has undergone a recent whole genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene losses and extensive local gene duplications  <cit> , which might be responsible of the lack of colinearity with other eurosid ii species. comparative genomics with the recently sequenced genome of the grapevine, provides additional evidence that the genome of arabidopsis has been thoroughly rearranged as related to an ancient angiosperm genome  <cit> . the fact that papaya, clementine, grapevine and poplar are long lived, clonally propagated, woody plants, might apparently cause a deceleration of their molecular clocks, resulting in genomes with higher resemblance to the ancestral eurosids genome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the construction of three genomic bac libraries of citrus clementina, with three restriction enzymes . the number of picked bac clones  and the average length of the inserts provide coverage of  <dig>  haploid genome equivalents, ensuring a wide representation of the genome of this species. these libraries are adequate for the construction of the physical map of c. clementina. the analysis of  <dig>  mb of genomic sequence produced by bac end sequencing has provided a first insight of the genome organization of c. clementina. the repetitive fraction of this species corresponding with transposable elements comprised  <dig> % of the genome, while the gene number was estimated to be  <dig> . this work also describes a set of  <dig>  ssrs and a collection of the first  <dig>  putative snps described in citrus that may be very useful for positional cloning, genetic and comparative mapping, nucleotide diversity analysis, and association studies. finally, comparative genomics through gene homology searches has shown that, in spite of their taxonomic classification, microsynteny between citrus and populus is higher than with arabidopsis that is a phylogenetically closer species.
