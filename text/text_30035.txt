BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus  <dig>  is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded and closed-circular dna virus that has been identified as the primary cause of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome  in pigs. pmws primarily affects pigs between the ages of five and  <dig> weeks. the clinical signs include progressive weight loss, jaundice, wasting, and respiratory disease, accompanied by increased mortality. the mortality rates of pmws vary from 1-2%, but may reach up to 30% in complicated cases. pmws has become endemic in many swine-producing countries, including china, canada, the united states, venezuela, australia, and the united kingdom
 <cit> .

dna microarray technology, in combination with bioinformatics, has emerged as an efficient high-throughput tool that offers great advantages in the study of the genomic expression profiles of cells and host-microbe interactions
 <cit> . this technology provides the ability to determine gene expression levels of thousands of different genes simultaneously. indeed, high density gene arrays have already revealed the status of host gene expression following infection by several viruses and bacteria, including influenza a virus
 <cit> , monkeypox virus
 <cit> , epstein-barr virus
 <cit> , streptococcus suis <cit> , and haemophilus parasuis <cit> .

the major target cells of pcv <dig> are the porcine monocyte/macrophage lineage cells 
 <cit> . one type of mlc, porcine alveolar macrophages , are the primary responders of the pulmonary innate immune system and defend against various pathogens
 <cit> . while pams are known to be involved in pcv <dig> defense, the underlying molecular mechanisms of pcv <dig> pathogenicity remain to be completely elucidated. furthermore, an immunosuppressive role has been characterized for pcv <dig> in porcine circovirus diseases 
 <cit> , but little is known about the genes that are involved in this process. the presence of granulomatous inflammation and multinucleated giant cells in pmws pigs
 <cit>  suggests a significant role for secreted cytokines and other immune-related signaling factors. previous studies have investigated the cytokine and chemokine gene expression profile of pmws by transcriptomic and genomic analyses. for example, the cytokine mrna expression profile in lymph nodes of pmws pigs was reported
 <cit> , as was the global transcriptome profile of colostrums-deprived piglets experimentally infected with pcv2
 <cit> . the genomic expression profile in lymph nodes of lymphoid-depleted pcv2-infected pigs was also reported
 <cit> . however, these results can not fully illustrate the pathogenesis of pcv <dig> 

therefore, the objective of the present study was to analyze the pcv2-induced gene expression profiles in isolated pams in vitro in order to reveal specific mechanisms of the host innate immune response to pcv <dig>  the temporal gene expression profiling using a two-channel microarray carrying thousands of genes was carried out with pams at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-infection  to discriminate pcv2-induced early and late changes in gene expression.

RESULTS
confirmation of pcv <dig> infection in pams
immunofluorescence assay  revealed green fluorescent cells in the infected pams, indicating that the pams were successfully infected by pcv <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after inoculation . there were no significant differences in the levels of viral dna or virus particles between the two time points . neither pcv <dig> particles nor the pcv <dig> nucleotide signal were detected in the mock-inoculated pams at any of the experimental time points.

transcriptome analysis of the pam response to pcv <dig> infection
the concentrations of rna ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/μl. all rna samples were considered to be of high quality, based on rna integrity number  values . the isolated mrna samples from  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi pams hybridized to  <dig> and  <dig> probe sets on the transcriptome microarray, respectively corresponding to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all probe sets . after quantile normalization and statistical analysis,  <dig> transcripts were identified -adjusted p-value < <dig> ). furthermore, the criteria of a two-fold or greater change in differential expression and a fdr of 5% were chosen to determine up-regulated and down-regulated genes. according to these criteria,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed  from baseline at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi . according to the corresponding biological process gene ontology  terms, or potential biological processes reported in recent publications, the majority of these genes were related to immune response, inflammatory response, antigen processing and presentation of peptide or polysaccharide antigen via mhc class ii, anti-viral immune response, cell motility, and negative regulation of apoptosis . however, the differential expression between  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi reached the threshold of statistical significance for only six of those genes . a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were selected to validate the microarray results by quantitative reverse transcription pcr  using the primers in table 
 <dig>  the qrt-pcr results confirmed, in general, the patterns of up-regulated and down-regulated expression of the  <dig> genes that was indicated by the microarray analysis .

note: the de genes are presented with putative functions assigned by the go term and manual annotation. many genes with multiple functions were only listed in one category according to specific biology processes. fc: fold change; fc≥2: up-regulation ; fc≤ <dig> : down-regulation.

functional go analysis of de genes in pcv2-infected pams
the ingenuity pathway analysis  program was used to determine the relevance of pam gene functionalities and gene networks associated with pcv <dig> infection. while  <dig>  and  <dig>  de genes were imputed into ipa, only  <dig> and  <dig> were characterized with specific cellular functions.

the  <dig> de genes from  <dig> hpi pams were placed into  <dig> functional groups . the most frequently represented category of gene functionality was inflammatory response  with  <dig> genes, followed by cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cellular growth and proliferation, and cellular compromise.

the  <dig> de genes from  <dig> hpi pams were placed into  <dig> functional groups . the most frequently represented category of gene functionality was also inflammatory response with  <dig> genes, followed by antigen presentation, cellular movement, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, and cellular growth and proliferation.

qrt-pcr validated de genes in pcv2-infected pams
in order to validate the differential expression of some of the de genes identified by microarray, eleven up-regulated genes and six down-regulated genes were selected for qrt-pcr analysis. all the selected genes were successfully amplified and the expression patterns corresponded to those observed by microarray. although the extent of fold-change  varied between the qrt-pcr and microarray results , the differential expression patterns were coincident, indicating the reliability of the microarray analysis.

toll-like receptors pathway analysis
activation of the innate immune response is controlled in large part by the tlr family of pattern-recognition receptors . a previous study showed that the dna of pcv <dig> could impair the plasmacytoid- and monocyte-derived dendritic cells ability to induce interferon -α and tnf-α by interacting with tlr <dig> and tlr9
 <cit> . in the current study, we verified the expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  cd <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> , tlr <dig> cofactor cd <dig>  and tlr <dig> , and down-regulation of tlr <dig> .

profile of pam secreted cytokines in response to pcv2-infection
when compared with the supernatant of mock-inoculated pams, pcv2-infected pams secreted significantly higher levels of interleukin - <dig> . tumor necrosis factor-alpha   and il- <dig>  levels were significantly higher in supernatants of pcv2-inoculated pams at  <dig> hpi . interferon-gamma , however, appeared to be significantly down-regulated  at  <dig> hpi but significantly up-regulated  at  <dig> hpi . the relative mrna levels of porcine il- <dig>  tnfα, il- <dig>  and ifnγ showed the same de trends as the secreted protein levels .

discussion
pcv <dig> is an important pathogen of swine that has effects on both the pork industry and animal welfare. despite the high mortality rates and widespread incidence of this pathogen, a definitive cure has not yet been found. an effective vaccine was created by merial in  <dig> 
 <cit> , and entered into widespread use in  <dig>  despite the fact that the current vaccine strategy can efficiently control pcv <dig> infection, immunization failures exist in the field, and the molecular mechanisms underlying pmws and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome  caused by pcv <dig> remain largely unknown. the present study aimed to identify genes involved in the immune response against pcv <dig> in primary alveolar macrophages. furthermore, by generating a comprehensive transcriptomic profile of the temporal pcv <dig> pathogenic process in the target host cells, we hoped to gain insights into the underlying molecular interactions and signaling pathways that may represent novel targets of improved preventative and therapeutic strategies.

toll-like receptors
toll-like receptors are essential sensors of microbial infection that are involved in the recognition of a variety of microbial products
 <cit> . to date,  <dig> tlrs have been identified and characterized for their particular cognate ligands and signaling cascades to trigger pathogen-targeted immune responses
 <cit> . for example, tlr <dig> recognizes guanosine- and uridine-rich sequences derived from ssrna viruses
 <cit> , while tlr <dig> recognizes single-stranded dna  in endosomal compartments and signals to induce the production of type  <dig> interferons  and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines; pcv <dig> dna has been shown to modulate cytokine secretion thorough interaction with tlr9
 <cit> . in our study of the circular, single-stranded dna virus, pcv <dig>  differential gene expression of tlrs was found. specifically, pcv <dig> infection of pams led to increased expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> cofactor cd <dig>  and tlr <dig>  monocytic cd <dig> signaling is usually activated upon exposure to bacterial lps, and this molecule’s up-regulation may induce ineffective antibacterial immunity. in addition, a similar mechanism has been demonstrated in human monocytic cells upon exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus
 <cit> . these receptors’ up-regulation may contribute to the increased sensitivity of macrophages to other pathogens, thereby augmenting the inflammation and host immune response. such an enhanced immune response may be beneficial, but an over-stimulation of the innate response could result in tissue damage. for example, the same phenomenon was observed upon macrophage exposure to tobacco smoke, wherein the expression of tlr <dig> was increased and severe inflammation was observed after treated with tlr <dig> ligand
 <cit> .

mhc class ii molecules
mhc class ii molecules play a central role in the initiation of the immune response by binding and presenting immunogenic peptides to cd4+ th lymphocytes. however, only a few cell types express mhc class ii molecules, such as the antigen presenting cell types that include macrophages, b lymphocytes, langerhans cells, and dendritic cells. the very complex and tight regulation of mhc class ii gene expression has direct implications for t lymphocyte activation. these molecules include doa, dob, dqa <dig>  dqb <dig>  dra, and drb <dig>  and their molecule chaperone cd74; all of which were up-regulated in pcv2-infected pams. this expression pattern contradicts the host response observed for other viruses, such as african swine fever virus 
 <cit> , classical swine fever virus
 <cit>  and influenza a virus
 <cit> , and that was observed in follicles and pams of pmws piglets
 <cit> . increased expression of mhc class ii molecular have been shown to be correlated to increased interferon production in pigs infection infected with hog cholera virus
 <cit> . ifn-γ up-regulation have been shown after  <dig> hpi, its up-regulation could benefit pcv <dig> replication
 <cit> . the aberrant expression of class ii antigens could also compromise production of immunoregulatory cytokines, compromising immune function and perhaps favor viral persistence through escape from immune recognition.

apoptosis and growth arrest
apoptosis is considered to be an important host mechanism that interrupts viral replication and eliminates virus-infected cells. viruses often kill infected cells by inducing apoptosis rather than necrosis, but repress apoptosis to prolong the life of the cell and increase the yield of progeny virions. serpinb <dig>  also called pi- <dig>  belongs to the large superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors, which bind to and inactivate serine proteinases, and acts to protect against granzyme b-mediated apoptosis
 <cit> . pcv2-infected pams were found to have enhanced serpinb <dig> expression, which may serve to prevent apoptosis and allow for longer-term replication and more virion production. bnip <dig>  an apoptosis-inducing dimeric mitochondrial protein
 <cit> , was also found to be increased in pcv2-infected pams. it is possible that this factor may represent the host’s counter response to pcv <dig>  by which host-induced apoptosis would act to limit the amount of infected cells. it is also possible that these bnip <dig> overexpressing cells represent a subset of pams that have reached full capacity of virus load, in which the virus itself may have manipulated the host gene expression to facilitate cell death and release of the virus progeny.

actin alpha  <dig>  is a smooth muscle α-actin, whose expression is transformation-sensitive to growth signals in normal cells. actively proliferating fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells have low levels of acta <dig>  but the inhibition of cell proliferation by density arrest or treatment with antimitotic agents induces the smooth muscle α-actin promoter
 <cit> . thus, the acta <dig> up-regulation that was detected in pcv2-infected pams may be the result of growth arrest induced by the virus the same phenomenon was found in rhabdomyosarcoma cells after ev <dig> infection
 <cit> .

eno <dig> is involved in the induction of cell death in fibroblasts and has been implicated in tumorigenicity of human breast carcinoma cells
 <cit> . its regulation of cell growth is further suggested by the presence of functional transcriptional repression domains
 <cit> . pcv2-infected pams showed enhanced eno <dig> expression. it is possible that up-regulation of this gene may enhance growth arrest in pcv2-infected cells, thereby culminating in cell death.

inflammatory response
serum amyloid a  <dig>  is a member of the saa family of apolipoproteins synthesized in response to cytokines released by activated macrophages, which often serve as clinical markers of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases
 <cit> . the pattern of increased saa <dig> expression observed in pcv2-infected pams suggested that pcv <dig> induced an acute inflammatory response at the early time point  of infection. tnf-α and il-1β are acute-phase proinflammatory mediators that promote inflammation and induce fever, tissue destruction, and, in some cases, shock and death
 <cit> . our study showed that pcv <dig> could induce tnf-α and il-1β expression  in pams at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. these results are in good agreement with those from a previous study of lymphoid tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells  of pmws pigs
 <cit> . saa <dig>  tnf-α, and il-1β up-regulation after pcv <dig> infection suggests the occurrence of systemic inflammation following pcv <dig> infection.

lymphohistiocytic to granulomatous pneumonia is a common histopathological finding in naturally-acquired pmws and experimentally-infected pcv <dig> pigs
 <cit> . chemokines, such as mcp-1/ccl- <dig>  were found to be up-regulated in the pcv2-infected pams. in a previous study, mcp- <dig> was suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of granulomatous inflammation in pmws-affected pigs
 <cit> . the progressive granulomatous inflammation has been speculated to be compromise organ function and result in pmws-associated fatalities
 <cit> . furthermore, the mcp- <dig> cytokine is known to be an important chemokine for the recruitment of monocytes from the blood
 <cit> . thus, macrophage infiltration has been suggested as an important feature of the pathogenesis and progression of pmws
 <cit> .

recruitment of inflammatory cells in injured tissue is regulated by various cytokines and chemokines. pmws-affected pigs present with increased expression of mip- <dig>  ccl- <dig>  il-1β, il- <dig>  and tnf-α mrna in the lymphoid tissues and pbmcs, suggesting that such cytokines and chemokines may contribute to the development of granulomatous lymphadenitis and recruitment of macrophages or other inflammatory cells to the pcv2-infected tissues
 <cit> . the pcv2-infected pams in our study showed up-regulation of mip- <dig>  ccl- <dig>  il-1β, il- <dig> and tnf-α mrna expression. tnf-α is known to activate microvascular endothelium and cause a pyrexic response
 <cit> . increased production of tnf-α may induce fever and respiratory distress in pcv2-infected pigs
 <cit> . il- <dig> is a chemoattractant for neutrophils and other polymorphonuclear leukocytes  that are produced following acute infection
 <cit> . interaction of il- <dig> and mcp-1/ccl- <dig> is also known to trigger tight adhesion of monocytes to vascular endothelium under flow conditions
 <cit> . the ability of pcv <dig> to induce il- <dig> production in pams or pbmcs has been previously reported
 <cit> . similar to il- <dig>  the pam-derived chemokine amcf-ii/cxcl5
 <cit>  is able to recruit pmns to a lesion area
 <cit> . unlike the pmn-derived chemoattractants discussed above, mcp- <dig> is a powerful chemoattractant for monocytes and its activities can be further enhanced by il-8
 <cit> . it is reasonable to speculate that the development of interstitial pneumonia in pigs suffering from naturally-acquired pmws or experimental infection of pcv <dig> may result from the recruitment of acute phase inflammatory cells and subsequent mononuclear phagocytic cells from blood vessels to interalveolar septa and alveolar spaces by up-regulated cytokines and chemokines released from pcv2-containing pams.

antiviral immune response
ifnγ is a th1-specific cytokine produced by macrophages, nk cells, and other cell types during the onset of viral infection. it has a potent antiviral property that contributes to the control of acute viral infections, and is an important mediator of cellular responses. ifnγ mrna was found to be slightly down-regulated at the early stage of in vitro pcv <dig> infection  of pams. this repressed expression may be indicative of suppressed th <dig> responses, which may facilitate viral persistence and delayed viral clearance. at the late stage of in vitro infection , however, the ifnγ expression level increased. such an up-regulation of expression may indicate a virus-modulated mechanism to enhance infection and replication at the late stage of pcv <dig> infection in vivo <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to evaluate the gene expression profile of pcv2-infected pams in vitro. microarray analysis showed that expression of  <dig> and  <dig> pam genes was altered after  <dig> and  <dig> hours of pcv <dig> infection, respectively. among these, several genes related to the inflammatory response were up-regulated, suggesting that pcv <dig> may induce systemic inflammation. collectively, this work established a comprehensive differential transcription profile of early and late pcv <dig> infection in pams, which revealed that pcv <dig> can induce persistent cytokine production mainly through the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> pathways.
