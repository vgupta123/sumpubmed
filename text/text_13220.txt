BACKGROUND
in dairy cattle, traits influencing efficiency of production can be characterized as production or functional traits. traits classified as functional, increase efficiency by reducing costs of inputs. milkability, health, fertility, feed efficiency and calving ease all belong to this group of functional, cost-saving traits
 <cit> .

milkability is a complex trait that is most often characterized by average milk flow rate , maximum milk flow rate  and total milking time 
 <cit> .

milkability has long been recognized as an economically important trait that can be improved through selection
 <cit> . by improving milkability, management costs of milking decrease through reduced labor and improved efficiency of the automatic milking system
 <cit> , which has been identified as an important factor affecting net profit
 <cit> .

in  <dig>  the italian brown breeders association  made an update to their selection index  to include milking speed measured as avgf. however, milking speed is unfavorably correlated with other economically important traits, particularly somatic cell score 
 <cit> . therefore with the inclusion of milking speed in the selection index, scs was also included with a slight negative weight in the tmi. this negative weight was introduced in the tmi to offset the predicted consequence that an increase in milking speed could potentially increase scs resulting in a possible increase of mastitis
 <cit> .

gray et al.
 <cit>  showed that a combination of milk flow parameters describing the overall patterns of milk removal would be an advantageous selection strategy for improved milkability, when compared to use of a single variable such as avgf. traits previously shown to be unfavorably correlated
 <cit>  with milking speed  could respond favorably to selection by including both milking flow and milking time measures in a sub-index with appropriate weights
 <cit> .

by exploiting the advances in molecular genetics and bioinformatics tools an increased understanding of milk flow traits on a molecular level could be achieved. development of dense snp marker panels has provided an opportunity to perform genome wide association studies  to determine biological differences that exist in an animal’s genetic makeup
 <cit> .

molecular genetic markers that are associated with phenotypic variation of complex traits, provide information that may be utilized through marker assisted selection
 <cit>  or genomic selection
 <cit> . using information available from markers in selection can increase the accuracy and efficiency of a breeding program when compared to traditional breeding schemes
 <cit> .

only a few quantitative trait loci  have previously been associated with milkability traits, namely milking speed measured on a subjective scale
 <cit> . these milking speed markers explain a fraction of the genetic variance associated with milk flow traits. it is likely that there are more genomic regions associated with milkability traits that have not been unveiled and some of these include genes, regulatory regions or some other sequence of dna that behaves differently due to a single mutation causing a change in biological mechanisms associated with milk flow. implementation of a gwas using a dense 50k marker panel will aid in the discovery of unidentified qtl regions for milking speed traits. significant markers could potentially represent causative mutations within previously identified genes, functional rnas or regulatory regions, or more likely are not causative by themselves but in sufficient linkage disequilibrium  to pick up the effect of the nearby causative factor. identification of candidate gene regions could lead to a better understanding of the biological mechanisms that control milking flow in dairy cattle. furthermore, differences in the number of identified regions and size of effects for individual snps can shed some light on the genetic architecture of milk flow related traits. the objective of this study was to identify snp markers associated with milk flow traits including total milking time , ascending time , time of plateau , descending time , maximum milk flow  and average milk flow  by gwas. as a result chromosomal regions would be identified that could include qtls for milkability traits that can potentially improve selection based on genomic predictions.

RESULTS
significant snps
among the milk flow traits investigated in this study heritabilities ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   and reliabilities ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . there were also  <dig>   to  <dig>   markers that were significantly different from  <dig> for each of the milk flow traits that were identified across all  <dig> bos taurus autosomes .

tmt – total milking time; at – ascending time; tp – time of plateau; dt – descending time; mmf – maximum milk flow; avgf – average milk flow; ebv – estimated breeding value.

markers across the genome with the largest absolute effects corresponding to setting a corrected p-value for multiple comparisons to p <  <dig> , within each trait, were selected for further investigation and comparison, this effectively corresponded to approximately one hundred markers for each trait . to facilitate comparisons we arbitrarily selected markers with the largest  <dig> effects . these explained  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total variance for tmt, at, tp, dt, mmf and avgf, respectively. table 
 <dig> summarizes the combined effect of the  <dig> markers with largest effects for each trait. many markers with the largest effects were either shared across traits or were within close proximity. markers that were close  were considered to be within a single region. the largest region spanned  <dig>  mb. additional file

3combined absolute effect – refers to the absolute largest effect that the markers can have on each of the milk flow traits by summing absolute effects across each region.

among all of the qtl previously mapped in the bovine genome only a few have been identified for milking speed  measured on a subjective scale. there are a total of  <dig> mspd qtl across  <dig> bta identified among holstein
 <cit> , normande
 <cit> , montbeliarde
 <cit>  and finnish ayrshire
 <cit>  dairy breeds. however, there have been no mspd qtl reported for brown swiss. nevertheless, significant markers identified from this study were located within all previously identified mspd qtl within other breeds
 <cit> .

udder morphometric traits  , udder attachment , udder cleft , udder composite index , udder depth , udder height  and udder width ) are associated with milk flow traits
 <cit> . it is understood that milk flow may be highly influenced by size, shape and overall confirmation of the udder
 <cit> . reduced milking performance has been recognized to be associated with larger or slacker teats as well and is influential in change of milking speed and time
 <cit> . for this study all udder morphometric qtl were categorized as a single trait referred to as ut.

other qtl potentially associated with milk flow are mammary health indicator traits , somatic cell count  and somatic cell score ). since most mammary infections are caused by bacterial invasion of the mammary gland through the teat canal cows with larger teat canals are more susceptible to mammary infections. larger teat canals also increases mmf
 <cit>  and increases in mmf may result in an increased incidence of clinical mastitis. both scc and scs have a positive genetic correlation with milk flow
 <cit>  and are considered to be indicator traits for clinical mastitis, therefore qtl for all three traits  were considered in the analysis.

there is an unfavorable relationship between production traits  and  <dig> day lactation milk yield my305) and milking time
 <cit>  thus qtl for these traits could possibly be co-located with significant markers for milk flow traits. numerous milk yield qtl  have been previously identified across the bovine genome in several breeds. only my qtl previously identified for brown swiss were here considered
 <cit> .

ascending time 
there were  <dig>  snp marker effects that were significantly different from  <dig> . markers with the largest effect  identified  <dig> distinct regions. among these regions  <dig> were within qtl related to milk flow previously identified, including mastitis, udder and milk production qtl. four of these regions located in bta <dig> , bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  were within previous mspd qtl. the variance explained by these single regions was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the total genomic variance for at, respectively. mspd qtl that were previously identified in holstein, french dairy cattle  and finnish ayrshire mapped within bta <dig> 
 <cit> , bta <dig> 
 <cit>  and bta <dig> 
 <cit> . the largest marker effect  for at  was located within a region on bta <dig>  and explained  <dig> % of the additive variance. ut 
 <cit>  and scs 
 <cit>  qtl also mapped to this region on bta <dig> 

time at plateau 
time at plateau  had the least number of effects that were significantly different from  <dig>  at  <dig>  markers across the entire genome. among the  <dig> largest effects for tp there were  <dig> regions of which  <dig> were within qtl previously identified for traits associated with milking production traits. two of these regions located in bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  were within mspd qtl previously identified for french dairy cattle and holstein on bta <dig> 
 <cit>  and bta <dig> 
 <cit> , respectively. the markers associated with mspd qtl on bta <dig> and bta <dig> explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genomic variance, respectively. the largest marker effect  was located on bta <dig>  explaining  <dig> % of additive variance for tp. this marker mapped within scs, ut  and my 
 <cit>  qtl previously identified.

descending time 
descending time  had  <dig>  markers significantly different from  <dig> . the  <dig> markers with largest effects identified  <dig> regions of which  <dig> were within qtl of interest. descending time had the largest number of regions mapping within mspd qtl. three regions located in bta <dig>  explaining a total of  <dig> % of the genomic variance were within the mspd qtl reported to be on bta <dig> 
 <cit>  and another three regions located in bta <dig> , bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  were within mspd qtl explaining  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total genomic variance, respectively. these qtl were previously identified on bta <dig> 
 <cit> , bta <dig> 
 <cit>  and bta <dig> 
 <cit> . the largest effect for dt  was the same marker that was largest for tmt, mmf and avgf  and explained  <dig> % of the total genomic variance for dt. this marker was within  <dig> qtl identified in holstein-friesian including cm 
 <cit>  scs 
 <cit> , and ut 
 <cit> .

total milking time 
total milking time is essentially a combination of at, tp and dt. there were  <dig>  markers across all  <dig> bta with predicted effects that were significantly different from  <dig>  for tmt. the  <dig> largest markers effect were located in  <dig> distinct regions of which  <dig> with at least one marker within a previously identified qtl for traits associated with milk flow. among these regions, there were  <dig> regions in bta <dig> , bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  within qtl previously identified for mspd in holstein, french dairy cattle and finnish ayrshire which explained  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genomic variance for tmt, respectively. these qtl were also among other milking flow related qtl that were previously identified within bta <dig> 
 <cit> , bta <dig> 
 <cit>  and bta <dig> 
 <cit>  including scs, my, cm and ut. similar to dt the marker with the largest effect  which explained  <dig> % of genomic variance for tmt was on bta <dig> .

maximum milk flow 
maximum milk flow  had the largest number of significant snps . there were  <dig> regions harboring the  <dig> largest markers for mmf. of these regions  <dig> mapped within previously discovered qtl. three of these regions on bta <dig> , bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  explaining  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % of the genomic variance for mmf mapped within mspd qtl on bta <dig> 
 <cit> , bta <dig> 
 <cit>  and bta <dig> 
 <cit> . the largest absolute effect  was identified on bta <dig>  and explained  <dig> % of genomic variance for mmf similarly to tmt and dt.

average milk flow 
average milk flow  had  <dig>  significant markers across the entire genome. among the  <dig> markers with largest effects there were  <dig> regions of which  <dig> within qtl of interest. regions on bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of genomic variance for avgf and were within two mspd qtl 
 <cit>  
 <cit>  on bta <dig> and bta <dig>  respectively. the marker with the largest effect  was also the same marker identified as having the largest effect for tmt, dt and mmf on bta <dig>  and explained  <dig> % of the genomic variance for avgf.

common markers among milk flow traits
as total milking time  is a composite measure of at, tp and dt , it was expected that a large proportion of markers associated with tmt would also be included in the largest snp effects for other traits. among the regions harboring  <dig> of the largest snp effects for tmt within qtl previously identified, only  <dig> regions were not shared with one of the other milking flow traits investigated in this study . similarly avgf had one region within a qtl that was not shared with any of the other traits and mmf did not have any unique regions within qtl. the overlap of avgf was expected due to its strong genetic correlation with mmf, tp and tmt
 <cit> . however, there were unique regions that were not within previously identified qtl.

as mentioned above the largest effect for tmt, dt, mmf and avgf was a single marker  on bta <dig> which was within a qtl rich region of  <dig> qtl for cm 
 <cit>  scs 
 <cit> , and ut 
 <cit> . although this marker was not the largest effect for at and tp it was within the top  <dig> largest effects. further investigation within a  <dig> mb region on each side of this marker revealed no annotated genes with obvious connection to milk flow.

while there were several common snps identified among the  <dig> with largest effect for each of the traits, additional unique snps were identified for each of the milk flow traits with tp having the most unique markers. this indicates that while milk flow traits show a medium to large genetic correlation
 <cit>  there might be regions of the genome that are uniquely associated with each trait.

a large number of markers identified for milk flow traits were in regions where qtl for mspd, my, scc, scs, ut and cm, were previously found , indicating that milking time is a complex trait that either incorporates many factors, influences several other traits or a combination of both. although associations between milking speed, scs, and clinical mastitis incidence has been somewhat controversial, it is generally accepted that fast milking whether measured subjectively
 <cit>  or electronically
 <cit>  is associated with higher levels of scs. one possible explanation for this biological correlation could be the result of increased teat sphincter diameter
 <cit> . this could result in an increase in milk flow and subsequently allow more pathogens to enter the mammary gland causing infection of the udder.

finding markers within qtl associated with udder morphometric traits was expected. it has been reported that udder morphometric traits including increased udder size and teat size tend to negatively influence the efficiency of the milking machine therefore increasing the amount of time it takes to milk
 <cit> .

complexity of milk flow traits
only a handful of traits in dairy cattle, such as milk-fat composition are highly influenced by few genes
 <cit> . in an effort to quantify the complexity of milk flow, pearson’s correlations between predicted bull ebvs using a 6-trait animal model and the direct genomic values  obtained from all markers available for sires within the prediction set were computed . these correlations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . it is acknowledged that the ebvs were predicted from a multi-trait model while dgvs were predicted using single trait methods. although these estimates may not be directly comparable they were used in the analysis given that they are the best predictor of the true breeding value of the data available for each of the methods of prediction.

markers within each milk flow trait were sorted based on their absolute effect for the given trait of interest. markers were isolated from the complete panel in subsets of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  snps with the largest effect. genomic breeding values and genomic variances were then obtained from these subsets of markers.

figure 
3b depicts the proportion of the correlation coefficient depicted in 3a recovered by ebvs predicted from phenotypic data and dgvs obtained from subsets of markers with the largest effects for each of the milk flow traits, namely  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  snps. in the figure correlation coefficient between ebvs and dgv predicted from  <dig> markers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  which explains 19% to 46% of the correlation between ebv and dgv predicted using all of the markers, as illustrated in figure 
3a. there appeared to be two traits, at and dt, for which panels of  <dig> markers captured twice as much correlation than, tmt, tp, mmf and avgf. while it is possible that this may be the result of the markers capturing qtl with larger effects this is unlikely due to the low heritability that was estimated for these traits. the large proportion of the correlation explained within at and dt is most likely the result of poor reliability for ebv obtained from phenotypic data. poor reliable estimates of ebvs resulted in a lower overall correlation between the ebv and dgv . given that the correlation is lower in general it is possible that a smaller number of markers would explain a larger proportion of the correlation.

among the other traits, with moderate heritabilities, breeding values obtained from  <dig> markers captured approximately one-fifth of the overall correlation. increasing the number of markers from  <dig> to  <dig> increased the correlation with approximately  <dig>  for all traits. correlations between ebvs and dgvs predicted from more than  <dig> markers plateaued revealing a non-linear relationship between correlations estimated from differing number of markers, contrary to what would be expected under a pure polygenic architecture. this offers possible evidence for the presence of moderate size qtl, associated with milk flow.

estimates of the additive genomic variance were computed from subsets of markers . these variances were then compared to the genomic variance computed from all the markers and the proportion of the variance that can be explained by these subsets of markers were reported in table 
 <dig>  the proportion of the variance explained was similar across all milk flow traits . over half of the genomic variation was explained by  <dig>  markers with the largest effects for each trait. when  <dig>  markers are used approximately 84% of the genomic variance can be explained, roughly equivalent to the amount of genomic variance explained by all significant markers.

1tmt - total milking time; at - ascending time; tp - time of plateau; dt - descending time; mmf - maximum milk flow; avgf - average milk flow.

there were a total of  <dig>  markers  that were located within coding or regulatory regions. this proportion remained unchanged among significant markers with an average  <dig>  markers that had a significant effect . similar results where obtained for subset of markers and no enrichment of coding snps was present among the most significant  <dig> markers while it appears that markers within genes and regulatory regions do not contribute more variation compared to an equal random set, density of markers for this analysis might not be sufficient to clearly separate the two components due to the large ld span in cattle.

1tmt - total milking time;at - ascending time; tp - time of plateau; dt - descending time; mmf - maximum milk flow, avgf – average milk flow.

dgvs were predicted from significant marker effects within coding regions , and were compared to dgvs predicted from all significant markers  without respect to whether they were in a coding region or not. the median proportions dgvsig that can be explained by dgvgene were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for tmt, at, tp, dt, mmf and avgf, respectively. time at plateau was the only trait where markers within coding regions explained a larger proportion of the breeding value than markers within non-coding regions. significant markers for tp within genes had larger effects than the remaining significant markers suggesting that the set of markers used in this study may have in fact identified genes that influence tp.

functional processes associated to snp affecting milk flow
within the mammary gland, milk is initially secreted into small sacs called alveoli, from which it is ejected during milking
 <cit> . mammary alveoli are surrounded by smooth muscle  cells
 <cit> , which are a prominent target cell for oxytocin
 <cit> . oxytocin stimulates contraction of myoepithelial cells, causing milk to be ejected into the ducts and cisterns
 <cit> . smooth muscle contractions in vertebrates are initiated by an increase in intracellular calcium
 <cit> . in turns the intracellular calcium binds with calmodulin, which then binds and activates myosin light-chain kinase
 <cit> . the calcium-calmodulin-myosin light-chain kinase complex phosphorylates myosin initiating contraction and activating the myosin atpase
 <cit> . by selecting the  <dig>  markers with largest effects in at, tp, dt, tmt, mmf and avgf a total of  <dig> unique genes were identified using the r package functsnp <cit> . performing a functional annotation through david
 <cit> , calmodulin-binding was the most significant functional category identified through sp_pir_keywords . a further search of the universal protein database
 <cit>  identified the adcy  gene , a gene implicated in calmodulin induced events and calcium signaling pathway
 <cit> . furthermore, a significant kegg pathway  was identified with  <dig> genes related to the calcium-signaling pathway . among these genes was the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2a htr2a,  a serotonin receptor. serotonin is a biogenic amine that is synthesized both in the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system
 <cit>  and the serotonergic system is involved in the regulation of oxytocin release
 <cit> . results the current gwas are only suggestive and further investigation should be carried out to confirm or rule out our findings, but the current study identified potential areas for future studies targeted at particular pathways that include genes that may influence milk flow.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have identified significant markers for six milk flow traits. there was an average of  <dig>  markers significant for each of the milk flow traits assessed with a majority of markers having a small effect. these traits should be considered polygenic; however, we were able to collocate  <dig> regions with largest effects to seven qtl previously identified for milking speed. each trait had significant markers that were in same region as my and udder confirmation qtl. phenotypic and genetic relationships between milking speed and mastitis, or its indicator traits, have been controversial, among the largest marker effects for each of the milk flow traits, there was an association with udder health qtl  and milking speed qtl. other significant regions for each of the traits were also identified but did not appear to be near any previously associated qtl or annotated gene requiring additional investigation to determine if these regions capture additional information that would be beneficial in understanding the biological mechanisms involved in milk flow.

genetic improvement of milk flow using genomic tools has yet to be implemented. whole genome selection methods should be considered as an alternative to using traditional selection methods or even considering the use of a subset of significant markers. this study verified that milk flow traits are complex and by including all information available from a snp marker panel for all six milk flow traits in a selection index, milk flow pattern is taken into account on a genomic level, therefore it can be more advantageous in improving selection strategy. incorporating all traits should decrease milk time while controlling for milk yield as well as control for clinical mastitis and its indicator traits of scc and scs and also other traits associated with udder size through indirect correlated response to selection in italian brown swiss.
