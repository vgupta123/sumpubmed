BACKGROUND
the components and structures of plant cell walls have evolved over millions of years, resulting in a diverse range of traits and functions. from a comparison of cell walls of land plants, it is apparent that there are some common structural components, and that at least a proportion of the cell wall biosynthesis machinery is likely to be conserved among embryophytes. studies have shown that members of the charophycean green algae, the closest relatives of land plants, possess cell walls that share many basic components with the embryophyte primary cell wall including a number of polysaccharides, structural proteins and lignin  <cit> . although some of the components of the plant cell wall may have formed via convergent evolution, it seems likely that others were present in a common ancestor and were retained following colonisation of the land by plants. it can be hypothesised that glycosyltransferases  required for synthesis of some of the cell wall polysaccharides will be conserved between lower and higher plants.

comparative biochemical analyses based on enzymatic digestion, linkage analyses and immunolocalisation of polysaccharide epitopes have been used to show similarities and differences between the cell wall components of angiosperms and bryophytes  <cit> . some bryophyte cell wall polymers including cellulose, glucuronoxylan and rhamnogalacturonan ii have been isolated and characterized  <cit> , but very little is known about the evolutionary relationship between the genes encoding the enzymes required for cell wall biosynthesis in lower and higher plants. the cell wall organisation of physcomitrella patens is similar to the angiosperm primary cell wall and almost all major non-lignin cell wall components including cellulose, hemicelluloses , pectins and arabinogalactan proteins  found in angiosperms are also present in bryophytes though in different proportions. there are however some components such as mixed-linkage β-glucans which are found in some land plants but not in the bryophytes.

cell walls of higher plants have significantly more xylan than lower plants such as the bryophytes indicating that a change in the proportion of the hemicellulose polymer present in cell walls may have been a key step in plant evolution  <cit> . the hemicellulose glucuronoxylan  is the second most abundant polymer in hardwood secondary cell walls, and is a major component of dicot wood  <cit> . there is a high degree of conservation of both the gx biosynthesis machinery and the structure of gx between arabidopsis and populus <cit> , but it is only recently that equivalent information has been obtained from lower plants including bryophytes  <cit> .

the structure of gx in angiosperm secondary cell walls is highly conserved consisting of a partly acetylated β-d--xylp backbone substituted with either 4-o-methylated - or non-methylated glucuronic acid  side chains  <cit> . analysis of gx from spruce, birch, aspen and arabidopsis has revealed a conserved oligosaccharide at the reducing end comprised of β-d-xylp--α-l-rhap--α-d-galpa--d-xyl  <cit> . in the moss physcomitrella patens, a xylan polymer substituted at the o- <dig> position by α-d-glcpa has been detected. however, in contrast to higher plants the moss xylan was not substituted by 4-o-me glcpa and the presence of a reducing end oligosaccharide was also not detected  <cit> . twelve glycosyltransferase genes have been identified to date in arabidopsis that are involved in gx synthesis; namely irregular xylem  <dig> , atirx10-like , atirx <dig>  atirx9-l, atirx <dig>  atirx14-l, atfragile fiber  <dig> , atfragile fiber  <dig> homolog , atirx <dig>  atparvus, atgux <dig> and atgux <dig> <cit> . although enzymatic activity has yet to be demonstrated for any of the putative gx synthesis enzymes, microsome experiments support the hypothesis that atirx <dig>  atirx <dig> and atirx <dig> are involved in synthesis of the β-d--xylan backbone  <cit>  while the atirx <dig>  atparvus and atfra <dig> enzymes are instead thought to function to synthesise the reducing end oligosaccharide  <cit> . evidence for conservation of the gx biosynthetic machinery between herbaceous and woody plants has come from the finding that populus homologs of putative arabidopsis gx synthesis enzymes are able to complement the corresponding arabidopsis mutants  <cit> . two populus irx <dig> homologs have been shown to be functionally conserved with the arabidopsis irx <dig> homolog as they can fully restore the arabidopsis irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant to a wild-type phenotype .

in this study, physcomitrella has been used to investigate the origin and functional role of the gt <dig> or irx <dig> gene family. results obtained suggest a common ancestor for the irx <dig> gene family in populus, arabidopsis and physcomitrella, and supports a partial conservation of the components in the gx biosynthetic machinery. in arabidopsis and populus, expression of a number of irx <dig> gene family members is strongly correlated with the vasculature whereas expression in physcomitrella is found in tissues undergoing expansion rather than in water-conducting cells. furthermore, the lack of increased xylose content in the arabidopsis irx <dig> irx10-l double knockout plants complemented with ppgt47a reveal that although the proteins are likely to share a common genetic origin, they are no longer directly functionally interchangeable.

RESULTS
the physcomitrella genome contains genes encoding homologs of all known enzymes involved in synthesis of the glucuronoxylan backbone
work carried out in arabidopsis has shown that there are multiple enzymes involved in the synthesis of the glucuronoxylan backbone , substitution of the backbone  and synthesis of the reducing end oligosaccharide   <cit> . to determine whether there is conservation of the genes required for xylan biosynthesis between higher and lower plants, each of the arabidopsis proteins proposed to function in the synthesis of glucuronoxylan were used to blast search the physcomitrella genome. a single putative irx <dig> homolog is present in physcomitrella encoded by pp1s7_455v <dig>   which shows a high degree of conservation with the arabidopsis and populus trichocarpa irx <dig> proteins . the n-terminal regions of the arabidopsis and populus irx <dig> proteins are the most divergent domains and contain predicted signal peptides in atirx <dig>  atirx10-l, ptgt47a- <dig> and ptgt47a- <dig> whereas the n-terminal region of ppgt47a has a predicted transmembrane domain in common with two of the other populus homologs ptgt47d- <dig> and ptgt47d- <dig>  <cit>  . two putative homologs were found for atirx9/irx9-l , whereas three putative homologs were each identified for atirx14/irx14-l , atfra8/f8h , and atgux1/gux <dig>  . interestingly, there were no closely related sequences found for atirx <dig>  although several sequences were identified that exhibited a 60% similarity with parvus, all of them exhibited a higher degree of similarity with other arabidopsis proteins and so were not considered likely to be homologs of parvus . the degree of similarity between the arabidopsis and physcomitrella homologs was between 25% and 48% except in the case of the ppgt47a which exhibited 76% similarity with atirx <dig> and atirx10-l. all genes are present in two or three copies encoding closely related proteins in both species, with the exception of ppgt47a which is unique . in all cases, duplicated or triplicated genes within a species encode proteins that cluster together . this suggests that gene duplications have occurred in both species after they split from each other. however, concerted evolution of related genes cannot be ruled out as a reason for close similarity, at least not in physcomitrella, where it has been previously observed  <cit> . the high degree of sequence similarity exhibited between the arabidopsis irx <dig> and the physcomitrella gt47a proteins further suggests that they may exhibit functional conservation and thus may give clues as to the evolutionary origin of the gx biosynthesis machinery in higher plants.

gene models were considered putative homologs if the arabidopsis protein that was used for the blast was the arabidopsis protein which exhibited most similarity. *although three physcomitrella gene models were identified with the corresponding protein exhibiting between  <dig>  and  <dig> % similarity to parvus, the sequences all exhibited stronger homology to at least  <dig> other arabidopsis proteins, and were therefore not considered as obvious homologs. .

irx <dig> related protein sequences from arabidopsis, populus and physcomitrella were analysed using the phobius programme  for the presence of n-terminal signal sequences and the locations of the hydrophobic predicted transmembrane core  flanked by the n- and c- regions.

the ppgt47a expression pattern indicates a role during early stages of development in physcomitrella
to investigate whether expression of ppgt47a is associated with specific tissues or developmental stages of growth, the uida reporter gene was fused to the 3′ end of the ppgt47a gene. the construct  was introduced into the physcomitrella genome at the endogenous ppgt47a site via homologous recombination. the pattern of pgt47a expression in physcomitrella was analysed by histochemical staining of  <dig> independent stable pgt47a-gus lines, each of which showed a similar staining pattern. expression was localised predominantly to tissues which were newly formed or undergoing expansion. strong expression was observed in the apical region of the adult gametophore , new branches forming on the side of the mature gametophore  and in the tissue immediately basal to the immature sporophyte . staining was also observed in the antheridia . a peak of expression was seen at the tips of the protonema side branches  and the lateral buds of the chloronema .

the ppgt47a gene partially complements the arabidopsis irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant
to establish whether the function of the ppgt47a enzyme is conserved between arabidopsis and physcomitrella, the ppgt47a gene under control of the 35s cauliflower mosaic virus  constitutive promoter was expressed in the arabidopsis irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant background. the ppgt47a gene partially rescued the irx <dig> irx10-l phenotype with plants forming a short inflorescence stem without the need for a protective growing cover that is normally required by the double mutant  <cit>  . rosette diameters of complemented plants were increased by 2- to 3-fold and the inflorescence stems were between 3- and 28-fold taller compared to the irx <dig> irx10-l plants grown under a plastic cover . safranin staining was performed on basal stem sections of the arabidopsis wild-type, irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant and complemented plants to identify regions of lignification. in arabidopsis wild-type plants, the cell walls of the xylem vessels and interfascicular fibers were heavily stained around the whole cell . in contrast, the irx <dig> irx10-l plants exhibited only a weak signal at the corners of the cell junctions indicating initiation of lignification, with virtually no evidence of secondary cell wall deposition in any other regions of the cell walls . irregular and variable safranin staining could be detected throughout the xylem and interfasicular fiber cell walls of stem sections from the complemented plants although the staining was less intense than in the wild-type. despite the apparent increase in secondary cell wall production, the cell walls of irx <dig> irx10-l plants expressing ppgt47a were thinner than wild-type cell walls and displayed a collapsed xylem vessel phenotype .

monosaccharide analysis was performed on cell wall material isolated from stems of the complemented plants to determine the biochemical basis for the partial complementation phenotype . there were no significant differences in the levels of the monosaccharides measured between the complemented lines and the irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant. in particular, it is noteworthy that the level of xylose remained low in the ppgt47a expressing lines in contrast to the results obtained when the arabidopsis irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant was complemented with the arabidopsis irx <dig> gene  <cit> .

ppgt47a knockout lines show no decrease in xylose or glucuronic acid content compared to wild-type
arabidopsis irx <dig> and irx10-l knockout mutants have proven to be informative in elucidating the function of the encoded proteins. in order to further investigate the function of ppgt47a, physcomitrella gt47a knockout mutants were generated. a construct was made in which the nptii coding sequence was inserted into the ppgt47a gene deleting part of exons  <dig> and  <dig> and the whole of exon  <dig>  the construct was introduced into the physcomitrella genome via homologous recombination resulting in the deletion of the central region of the endogenous ppgt47a gene to create a likely null knockout mutant. knockouts were analysed by pcr using primers spanning the recombination site to identify lines in which the endogenous ppgt47a gene had been disrupted. the gametophores of the knockout lines were visually similar to wild-type with no obvious morphological changes when grown on bcd media . further experiments were carried out to test whether varying the composition of the growth media by addition of different sugars or hormones under different light conditions  revealed any phenotypic changes in the knockout lines but none were observed . monosaccharide analysis of gametophore cell walls from the knockout lines  did not show any significant differences compared to the wild-type. of particular interest is the observation that there was no difference in xylose content between knockout and wild-type gametophores in contrast to the results obtained for the arabidopsis irx <dig> and irx10-l mutants  <cit> .

discussion
an important developmental adaptation of land plants involved the ability to form conductive tissues allowing efficient exploitation of available mineral and water resources. it has been suggested that the xylan polymer could have provided a pre-adaptive advantage to ancestors of vascular plants and contributed to the evolution of efficient water conducting systems  <cit> . detection of glucuronoxylan in physcomitrella <cit>  shows that the xylan polymer was present in a common ancestor prior to divergence of the bryophytes and vascular plants. the finding that the physcomitrella ppgt47a gene is able to partially substitute for the lack of function of irx <dig> or irx10-l in arabidopsis together with the high degree of sequence conservation further strengthens the argument that there was a common ancestor protein. despite this, components of the gx synthesis machinery appear to have evolved with the result that the arabidopsis irx <dig>  irx10-l and the physcomitrella gt47a proteins although apparently originating from a common ancestor, do not exhibit identical functions or activities.

it has been speculated that the arabidopsis irx <dig> protein forms a complex together with atirx <dig> and atirx <dig> and that this complex is responsible for the synthesis of the backbone of gx  <cit> . atgux <dig> and atgux <dig> are proposed to add the glca side chains to the backbone  <cit>  while irx <dig>  fra <dig> and parvus are thought to synthesise the reducing end oligosaccharide  <cit> . interestingly, physcomitrella homologs can be identified for all of the known gx synthesis proteins with the exception of irx <dig> and parvus. recent studies suggests that xylan structure in physcomitrella differs from that of higher plants and may as in the grasses lack the reducing end oligosaccharide which otherwise is thought to be universally conserved amongst the dicots. the ability to synthesise the reducing end oligosaccharide structure thus may be a relatively recent adaptation that is only found in some higher plants.

a previous study utilised a number of anti-xylan antibodies which recognise distinct epitopes to localise xylan in physcomitrella <cit> . these antibodies produced different labelling patterns – for example lm <dig> which strongly labels axillary hair cells and ccrc-m <dig> which shows labelling of leaf cell walls in addition to the axillary hair cells. in this study, the physcomitrella irx <dig> promoter was found to direct expression of the gus reporter in the apical region of the adult gametophore, new branches forming from the gametophore and tissues basal to the immature sporophyte . there was no preferential staining of axillary hairs observed in any of the gus lined studied. however, the antibody recognition of xylan in axillary hairs does not rule out presence of xylan epitopes masked by other cell wall components in other physcomitrella cell wall tissues. furthermore, the possibility that ppirx <dig> functions in making a different polysaccharide or makes a form of xylan in physcomitrella which is not recognised by the currently available anti-xylan antibodies cannot be discounted. in the absence of a functional enzymatic assay for ppirx <dig> it is currently not possible to be certain about its enzymatic activity, although it is reasonable to hypothesise that it plays a role in xylan biosynthesis, a conclusion which is supported by the partial complementation of the arabidopsis irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant.

failure of ppgt47a to fully complement the irx <dig> irx10-l arabidopsis mutant supports functional divergence between the arabidopsis and physcomitrella irx <dig> family of proteins
the finding that the physcomitrella gt47a protein only partially rescues the atirx <dig> irx10-l double mutant demonstrates that although the proteins are highly conserved at the sequence level, there are important differences which influence function. there are a number of possible reasons for these apparent functional differences. firstly, the enzymatic activity of ppgt47a may be different to that of the arabidopsis irx <dig> or irx10-l proteins. despite the high degree of sequence conservation between the arabidopsis and physcomitrella irx <dig> proteins, subtle amino acid differences could give an altered enzymatic activity but in the absence of a functional enzymatic assay this cannot currently be tested. alternatively, ppgt47a could have the same enzymatic activity as the arabidopsis irx <dig> but the interaction between irx <dig> and/or irx <dig> to form a putative functional complex may not be optimal. a third possibility is that the targeting or subcellular localisation of ppgt47a is not correct when expressed in arabidopsis. the highly divergent n-terminal domain that in the arabidopsis irx <dig> protein encodes a predicted signal peptide, in physcomitrella instead forms a predicted transmembrane domain . thus, mislocalisation and/or a different conformation of the ppgt47a protein compared to atirx <dig> may combine to produce only a small amount of a functional gx synthesis complex or alternatively a complex with low activity in the partially complemented arabidopsis plants.

evolutionary adaption of the irx <dig> family of enzymes
the arabidopsis irx <dig> and populus ptgt47a- <dig> genes are expressed within the vascular tissue made up mainly of cells rich in secondary cell walls. bryophyte water conducting tissues in contrast do not form thickened cell walls and so it is unsurprising that the expression pattern of ppgt47a differs from that of the arabidopsis homologs. the ability of ppgt47a to partially complement the arabidopsis irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant plants shows that there is a degree of functional overlap between the arabidopsis and physcomitrella enzymes but that either activity, conformation or targeting of the enzymes prevent full rescue of the wild-type phenotype. interestingly, the degree of similarity is higher between ppgt47a and atirx10-l than for atirx <dig> indicating that irx10-l is closer to the ancestral form of the protein. the expression of ppgt47a in physcomitrella tissues undergoing primary cell wall formation contrasts with that of the arabidopsis irx <dig> gene which is associated with tissues forming secondary cell walls. in vascular plants, the irx <dig> family appears to have undergone a sub- or neo-functionalisation resulting in at least a subset of the genes becoming specialised for secondary cell wall formation.

analysis of the monosaccharide sugar composition of cell walls isolated from the irx <dig> irx10-l lines partially complemented with the ppgt47a gene does not show any significant changes in comparison to the irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant indicating that either changes are in a minor component of the cell wall and thus below the detection limit or that the ppgt47a function is not related to the cell wall composition. although current evidence strongly indicates that irx <dig> and related proteins from other plants function in glucuronoxylan biosynthesis, there have been previous reports suggesting involvement of the tobacco npgut <dig>  another member of the irx <dig> family of proteins, in rhamnogalacturonan ii  biosynthesis, adding glca to one of the side chains of the rgii polysaccharide  <cit> . the decrease in the level of glca reported for the npgut <dig> tobacco mutant is greater than can be explained by a reduction in rgii levels alone arguing against npgut <dig> having a sole function in rgii synthesis. interestingly, the npgut <dig> mutant also exhibits a decrease in xylose content, implying that xylan synthesis could also be affected. furthermore, the tobacco npgut <dig> protein is able to perform the same enzymatic function as the arabidopsis irx <dig>  restoring xylan levels to those of the wild-type when fused with the n-terminal  <dig> amino acid domain of the atirx <dig> protein and expressed in the irx <dig> irx10-l background  <cit> . although this result supports an involvement of npgut <dig> in glucuronoxylan biosynthesis, the possibility that members of the irx <dig> family, including ppgt47a, could function in the synthesis of rgii or an rgii-like polymer cannot currently be discounted.

the role of ppgt47a in physcomitrella
a major advantage of using physcomitrella is the possibility to make clean loss of function mutants by homologous recombination. this approach was used to create a knockout mutant for the ppgt47a gene. however, the knockout mutant had no obvious phenotypes under the conditions tested, nor did monosaccharide analysis of the gametophore cell wall reveal any significant changes in the mutant . we conclude from this that loss of ppgt47a function either does not affect the cell wall composition, or alternatively that any such effects are too subtle to be detected in our analysis. it should be noted that rgii and xylan are both known to be minor components of the bryophyte cell wall  <cit> , and alterations in the composition of either or both polymers might therefore have escaped detection in our analysis of total cell wall material.

the absence of an obvious knockout phenotype could be due to several reasons. it is possible that the ppgt47a gene is functionally duplicated in physcomitrella. although this is unlikely since there are no close homologues of ppgt47a in the physcomitrella genome  <cit> , the possibility exists that another more distantly related gt can provide the same function as ppgt47a. alternatively, it is possible that the modifications catalyzed by ppgt47a are important in physcomitrella only under certain conditions, such as abiotic stress, but not under standard laboratory conditions. in any case, the fact that ppgt47a is strongly conserved and shows no evidence of being a pseudogene suggests that it encodes a functional protein, a conclusion that is reinforced by its ability to partially complement the arabidopsis irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant.

CONCLUSIONS
genes encoding the enzymes required for synthesis of the gx backbone are highly conserved between physcomitrella, arabidopsis and populus highlighting the importance of the polysaccharide throughout the plant kingdom. while the precise function of the physcomitrella gt47a gene remains to be elucidated, its ability to partially complement the arabidopsis irx <dig> irx10-l double mutant demonstrates that it encodes a gt with similar functional specificity to atirx <dig> and atirx10-l. interestingly the absence of homologs of irx <dig> and parvus in the physcomitrella genome indicates that the ability to synthesise the reducing end oligosaccharide of gx is an adaptation only found in higher plants. it is tempting to speculate that evolution of the gx biosynthesis machinery may have been a key step in the evolution of higher plants.
