BACKGROUND
cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by vibrio cholerae that can be lethal within hours if left untreated. in  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  cases were registered from  <dig> countries, including  <dig>  deaths  <cit> . the severity, duration, and frequency of cholera epidemics appear to be increasing  <cit> , indicating that cholera is a severe public health problem. in addition, v. cholerae is considered a category b bioterrorism agent by the cdc  <cit> . infection usually occurs by consumption of contaminated water, the natural habitat of v. cholerae, or contaminated food. within the v. cholerae species, over  <dig> serogroups have been identified but only serogroup o <dig> and o <dig> strains that are able to produce cholera enterotoxin  and toxin-coregulated pilus  can cause epidemics. the toxigenicity of a v. cholerae strain depends on its ability to produce the ct, encoded by the ctxab genes, and tcp, encoded by the vibrio pathogenicity island   <cit> . however, these virulence factors are also described in non-o1/o <dig> v. cholerae isolates without causing an epidemic threat  <cit> . next, occasionally, other strains of v. cholerae may cause diarrhea, but they do not have epidemic potential  <cit> . rapid detection and identification of threatening microorganisms is essential for an effective response to an infectious disease outbreak. therefore, rapid discrimination between epidemic v. cholerae o1/o <dig> strains and other v. cholerae strains is crucial. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  is increasingly used for quick identification of bacteria and possesses advantages over conventional techniques in that it is fast, accurate, cheap and suitable for high-throughput identification  <cit> . the discriminatory power of maldi-tof ms in analysis of whole bacterial cell lysates overlaid with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix is usually sufficient to identify bacteria to the species level but may also be used to differentiate between strains belonging to one species if adequate protein extraction procedures are performed  <cit> . the aim of this study was to develop a maldi-tof ms assay able to discriminate between toxigenic and epidemic v. cholerae o1/o <dig> strains and other mostly non-o1/o <dig> isolates. to extend the measurable range of the maldi-tof ms and thereby increase the discriminatory power of the ms spectra, ferulic acid was used as a matrix  <cit> . the outer membrane protein ompu was identified as a suitable biomarker for discriminating between toxigenic and epidemic strains and non-epidemic strains.

methods
bacterial strains
in total,  <dig> clinical and environmental isolates of v. cholerae and vibrio mimicus  were obtained from instituto tecnológico la marañosa, spanish ministry of defence, san martín de la vega, madrid, spain, norwegian defence research establishment, kjeller, norway, and military institute of hygiene and epidemiology, pulawy, poland   <cit> . the human isolates were all collected as part of standard patient care. the isolates were collected from different areas of the world. thirty-three, three, and twelve isolates were serotyped as o <dig>  o <dig>  and non-o1/o <dig> serogroups, respectively. from the  <dig> serogroup o <dig> isolates,  <dig> were clinical isolates,  <dig> were environmental isolates, and five isolates were from an unknown source. two serogroup o <dig> isolates were clinical isolates and one was of unknown origin. from the isolates not belonging to serogroup o <dig> or o <dig>  two isolates were of clinical origin and the  <dig> remaining isolates were of environmental origin.

confirmation of strain identification
identification of the isolates at species level was confirmed by maldi-tof ms using biotyper  <dig>    <cit> . serogroup and serotype were confirmed using the vibrio cholerae e agglutinating sera kit containing specific antisera o <dig> polyvalent agglutination serum, inaba agglutination serum, and ogawa agglutination serum  according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.

genotyping of isolates with multilocus sequence typing  analysis
mlst analysis was performed according to teh et al.  <cit> . internal gene fragments of dnae, lap, reca, gyrb, and cat were pcr amplified and sequenced. the gmd gene was not included in the analysis due to low discriminatory power  <cit> . each sequence variant of a locus was assigned a distinct allele number. in the case that no pcr product could be obtained for a specific allele, the number zero was assigned. the allele profiles were entered into bionumerics version  <dig>  software  as character values, and the genetic relationship between isolates was constructed using the categorical coefficient and the minimum spanning tree algorithm. isolates that differed at two or fewer loci were considered genetically closely related, while single locus variants  were defined as having at least three alleles that were different from all other tested isolates.

isolates were screened for the presence of the virulence genes ctxab and tcpa by pcr  <cit> . template dna was obtained from supernatants of cell suspensions lysed by heating for 10 min at 95°c. amplification of dna fragments from dnae, lap, reca, gyrb, cat, ompu, ctxab, and tcpa was performed with a hotstar taq mastermix kit . the primers used were previously described by teh et al.  <cit> . the ompu genes from  <dig> isolates , six environmental isolates  were amplified using the primers ompu-fw  and ompu-rv , which anneal approximately 80 bp up- and downstream of the ompu open reading frames. the pcr products were bidirectionally sequenced. dna sequencing was performed by baseclear b.v. .

sample preparation for maldi-tof ms analysis
v. cholerae isolates were grown for 16 h at 35°c on blood agar plates. sample preparation for maldi-tof ms analysis of whole cell lysates was performed as previously described  <cit> . each isolate sample was spotted eight times on the maldi target. four spots were overlaid with  <dig>  μl of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid  in an acetonitrile/water solution  with  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid . four spots were overlaid with  <dig>  μl of a matrix solution containing  <dig>  mg/ml ferulic acid , 17% formic acid and 33% acetonitrile , hereafter referred to as fa+  <cit> . spots were dried at room temperature.

mass spectra acquisition
the mass spectra were acquired automatically on a bruker autoflex iii smartbeam instrument  in linear mode. spots overlaid with hcca matrix were analyzed using the following parameters: 50% laser intensity, positive polarity, 350 ns pie delay, acceleration voltage of 20 kv  and  <dig>  kv , lens voltage of 8 kv, linear detector voltage of  <dig>  kv, and 500 da detector gating. composite mass spectra were generated from  <dig> different positions per spot using, in total,  <dig>  laser shots at each spot generated by a 200-hz smartbeam laser . the mass spectra were recorded in a mass/charge  range of  <dig>  –  <dig> . the parameters used for analysis of the spots overlaid with the fa+ matrix were: 80% laser intensity, positive polarity, 350 ns pie delay, acceleration voltage of 20 kv  and  <dig>  kv , lens voltage of  <dig>  kv, linear detector voltage of  <dig>  kv, and 4000 da detector gating. composite mass spectra were generated from  <dig> different positions per spot using, in total,  <dig>  laser shots at each spot generated by a 200-hz smartbeam laser . the mass spectra were recorded in a m/z range of  <dig>  –  <dig> . the instrument was externally calibrated with a bacterial test standard  when analyzing hcca-overlaid spots or peptide calibration standard ii  when analyzing spots overlaid with fa+. to evaluate the reproducibility of the newly developed method, the entire test was repeated on a separate day.

data analysis ms spectra
the ms spectra obtained from the spots overlaid with the hcca matrix were analyzed using maldi biotyper  <dig>  software and bruker’s security relevant library . these libraries together contain  <dig> reference spectra  from various vibrio species, including three v. cholerae strains and one v. mimicus strain. for each measurement, a logarithmic score value was determined by calculating the proportion of matching peaks and peak intensities between the test spectrum and the reference spectra of the database  <cit> . identification at species level was based on the highest of the four logarithmic values  <cit> . all ms spectra obtained from spots overlaid with the fa+ matrix were analyzed using matlab software . the spectra were first converted into the mzxml format using the bruker daltonics supplied software  and subsequently converted to the matlab binary format using mzxml read procedure. further processing was performed using the matlab bioinformatics toolbox  routines such as resampling , baseline subtraction , alignment on a peak mass of  <dig> , which was present in the ms spectra of all v. cholerae isolates, normalization  and visualization of spectra in a heat map. peaks were automatically selected using standard peak selection algorithm . the highest peak in the region of  <dig>  –  <dig>  kda per isolate was automatically identified.

RESULTS
strain identification
forty-eight isolates acquired from different strain collections  and previously identified as v. cholerae were analyzed using maldi-tof ms and biotyper  <dig>  software . all strains were identified as v. cholerae with matching scores of  <dig>  to  <dig>  following the highest matching score rule  <cit> . as a control, one v. mimicus isolate was analyzed, which resulted in a matching score value of  <dig> , indicating a ‘probable genus identification’. in addition, serogroup and serotype designations were confirmed using specific antisera.

mlst analysis
to determine the genetic relationship among the 48 v. cholerae isolates, a mlst analysis was performed. accession numbers: cat kf <dig> - kf <dig>  dnae kf <dig> - kf <dig>  gyrb kf <dig> - kf <dig>  lap kf <dig> - kf <dig>  and reca kf <dig> - kf <dig>  the isolates were differentiated into six different genotypes  and six single locus variants  . the presence of the virulence genes ctxab and tcpa was determined by pcr. all isolates of serogroups o <dig> or o <dig> that contained the ctxab and tcpa were highly related . within this group, all o <dig> isolates contained the type-specific antigen of the serotype ogawa with the exception of one isolate that belonged to serotype hikojima and one isolate of unknown serotype. v. cholerae o <dig> strains of serotype hikojima are considered to be rare  <cit> . isolates outside the gt <dig> group were determined to be negative for ctxab with the exception of one slv, an isolate of serogroup o <dig> that contained ctxab and tcpa. eight isolates of serogroup o <dig>  serotype inaba, isolated from water in spain and from prawns in ecuador were genetically closely related . three other isolates of spanish origin were genetically related . furthermore, three pairs of closely related isolates were identified. two pairs were isolated from the bug river in poland , while another pair was isolated in norway from seawater near oslo . six slvs from spain, norway and poland were observed.

maldi-tof ms analysis
to obtain spectra of a wider m/z range than acquired with hcca as a matrix, whole cell extracts were analyzed with maldi-tof ms using fa+. spectra were initially recorded in a mass-to-charge range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  . as no significant peaks were visible above an m/z value of  <dig> , spectra were recorded up to m/z =  <dig>  in following experiments . after the datasets were normalized, the baseline was subtracted, and data were aligned and normalized, a heat map was generated to visualize differences between the ms spectra . a simple algorithmic peak search procedure allowed us to identify a prevalent peak near an m/z value of  <dig>  that appeared to be discriminatory among the different genotypes . in the spectra of all epidemic isolates of serogroups o <dig> and o <dig> , this peak corresponded to an average mass of  <dig>  da with a standard deviation of 22 da except for the o <dig> serotype hikojima strain . in the spectra of the other isolates, the corresponding peak differed at least 70 da from that of gt <dig> . the peaks that were closest to the peak mass of the gt <dig> spectra were those measured in the spectra of gt <dig>  the non-epidemic v. cholerae o <dig> inaba isolates related to a spanish outbreak, which were  <dig>  +/- 20 da.

to test the reproducibility of the observed differences in the discriminatory peak masses, the experiment was repeated in a different manner in which isolates were randomly distributed into separate sets. the results for gt <dig> and gt <dig> are summarized in table  <dig>  the mean peak masses of the specific marker in the gt <dig> and gt <dig> isolates were  <dig>  +/- 31 da and  <dig>  +/- 30 da, corresponding to mean mass shifts of - <dig> and -175 da, respectively, compared to the first experiment. this shows that in the m/z range near  <dig> , the measured peak masses can deviate between separate experiments but that differences between different samples are relatively constant. by including an internal control of known mass, spectra can be calibrated. reproducibility was further supported by the median of the gt <dig> and gt <dig> measurements, which were maximally 5 da different from the mean, indicating a gaussian distribution of the measurements.

identification of discriminatory peak as ompu
one peak in the ms spectra representing the most abundant protein in a mass range of  <dig> to 40 kda in v. cholerae cells grown overnight on rich medium agar plates was suggested to be a biomarker to differentiate between various v. cholerae strains. to identify this protein, whole cell lysates were analyzed by sds-page . protein extracts from eight isolates of four different genotypes: gt <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and a slv, were prepared from the same colony material that was used for ms analysis. one prominent band in the mass range of  <dig> – 37 kda was present in the extracts of each of the isolates except for isolate ffivc <dig>  the ‘hikojima strain’, which had two equally strong bands differing approximately 2 kda in apparent mass. differences in apparent masses in the sds-page analysis correlated with the differences of the peak masses in the ms spectra. the protein bands were excised, trypsin digested and analyzed by lc-ms/ms for identification. of each band, the vast majority of peptides was identified as derived from ompu homologs, except for the upper band of the hikojima strain, which was identified as ompt . to confirm the correlation of the mass differences of the ompu homologs with the peak mass differences, the ompu genes of  <dig> isolates were amplified and sequenced. . the theoretical masses of the mature ompu homologs with omission of the signal peptide correlated with the observed peak masses of the ms spectra  but not well enough to identify an epidemic isolate on basis of the measured peak mass alone. however, the theoretical mass differences between the isolates were consistent with the differences in the ms spectra within one experiment. the amino acid sequences of ompu proteins from the epidemic v. cholerae o <dig> ogawa and o <dig> isolates  were identical to the sequence of the ompu protein from the epidemic type strain v. cholerae o <dig> el tor inaba n <dig>  . the ompu protein from the v. cholerae o <dig> serotype hikojima  differed at three positions  causing a mass difference of only one dalton . the ompu proteins from the other tested strains deviated more from this sequence . the ompu proteins that were closest in mass were from the non-toxigenic outbreak isolates 080025/fe and 080025/fi , which differed at  <dig> positions, resulting in a 72 da lower mass. the resolution of the maldi-tof ms spectra was sufficient to make this distinction .

ompu is conserved among epidemic v. cholerae strains
using blastp, the amino acid sequence of mature ompu protein of v. cholerae n <dig>  which was used as a reference, was screened against the ncbi protein database . at the time of preparation of this article, 181 v. cholerae ompu homologs were present in the ncbi database. ninety-six ompus were identical to the reference ompu  and these were all present in isolates of serogroup o <dig> or o <dig> that contain ctxab and tcpa. one exception to this was a v. cholerae isolate of serotype o <dig> , which was isolated during an outbreak in sudan in  <dig> . this strain was shown to form a highly uniform clone together with v. cholerae o <dig> and o <dig>  <cit> . two strains differed at one position from the reference ompu. for one of these homologs, no strain information was provided. the ompu of this isolate was 34 da lower in mass compared to the reference ompu. from the other isolate, cp <dig>  a v. cholerae o <dig> containing ctxab and tcpa ompu has a 58 da higher mass than the reference ompu from n <dig> . the ompu proteins from two closely related v. cholerae strains of serogroup o <dig>  the “classical” biotype, rc <dig>  and o <dig> , were identical to that of the o <dig> hikojima strain tested in this study , having three amino acid mutations compared to n <dig> ompu, which results in a mass difference of 1 da . all other ompu homologs retrieved in the blastp search contained ten or more mutations compared to the reference ompu, resulting in a 58 da lower mass in one case  or 70 da or more difference in all other cases. the isolates harboring these ompus were all non-o1/o <dig> strains, with the exception of two o <dig> strains. however, no ctxab or tcpa genes were found in the genome sequences of these strains, which strongly suggests that these are non-epidemic strains.

in addition to the screening of ompu homologs present in the ncbi protein database,  <dig> ompu sequences identified in completed whole genome sequences or whole genome shotgun  data of v. cholerae isolates available in the ncbi database were analyzed, and concomitantly, screened for the presence of the toxigenicity genes ctxa and tcpa. based on sequence similarity with the o-antigen biosynthesis genes of o <dig> and o <dig> in n <dig> and mo <dig>  respectively,  <dig> strains were presumed o <dig> or o <dig>  the amino acid sequence variation in ompu in the  <dig> strains that also contained ctxa and tcpa was limited. in nine strains ) there was one amino acid difference compared to reference ompu, resulting in  <dig> and 48 da higher mass for eight strains and one strain, respectively. the variation in ompu from six serogroup o <dig> isolates not harboring ctxa and tcpa differed 70 da or more, similar to what was found with the blastp search. from the  <dig> analyzed non-o1/o <dig> strains the ompu mass was in one case  58 da lower than that of the reference ompu  and in all other cases differed more than 70 da.

it was shown that ompu homologs differing 72 da in theoretical mass  could be well distinguished, as well as ompu proteins from 080025/fl, 080025/ge  and ffivc <dig> , which differed by only 29 da in mass  and gt <dig> ). therefore, it can be assumed that ompus from epidemic strains  can be distinguished from non-epidemic v. cholerae strains .

discussion
in this study, we demonstrate that the outer membrane protein ompu from v. cholerae can be used as a biomarker of epidemic strains of v. cholerae in a new adapted maldi-tof ms assay. the use of ferulic acid as a matrix instead of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, commonly used in standardized maldi-tof assays for identification of bacteria, allowed for a larger measurable mass range , thereby including larger proteins such as ompu  in the analysis. the resolution of the spectra was sufficient to discriminate between epidemic v. cholerae o1/o <dig> strains and other less pathogenic strains on the basis of mass differences in ompu. ompu appeared to be the dominant peak in an m/z range of  <dig>  –  <dig>  in the spectra of all  <dig> tested strains except for the spectrum representing the v. cholerae o <dig> strain of serotype hikojima, where the most dominant peak was identified as ompt. ompu and ompt are major outer membrane proteins of v. cholerae  <cit> . ompu is expressed when cells are colonizing a human host, while ompt is repressed at this time  <cit> . reproducible differences between the ompu peak masses of different mlst genotypes ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda enabled discrimination of epidemic isolates from less or non-pathogenic isolates. sequencing of the ompu genes in v. cholerae isolates representing different genotypes and a database analysis revealed that the amino acid sequence of ompu from the epidemic v. cholerae o1/o <dig> and o <dig> strains is highly conserved, while ompu homologs from other v. cholerae isolates varied from this sequence. these differences in amino acid sequence resulted in almost all cases in mass differences of more than 70 da, which was sufficient to distinguish the “epidemic” ompu proteins from ompu proteins of other strains with the resolution of the method presented here. in general, differences in ompu peak masses between strains were well reproducible in multiple experiments. however, small variations in the ompu peak masses between separate experiments were observed, indicating that the method requires inclusion of a standard sample for calibration containing a characterized v. cholerae strain. among the ompu homologs of non-epidemic strains present in the ncbi database, one had a theoretical mass of 58 da less than that of the “epidemic” ompu protein, while in all other non-epidemic v. cholerae isolates the mass differed more than 70 da. from the in silico analyzed  <dig> ‘epidemic’ isolates the theoretical mass of ompu from eight, one and two isolates differed  <dig>   <dig> and 1 da, respectively. therefore, it can be assumed that epidemic strains  can be distinguished from non-epidemic v. cholerae strains  based on ompu using the described maldi-tof ms assay.

the v. cholerae strain of serotype hikojima was shown to produce both ompu and ompt . however, in the obtained ms-spectra ompu was not detected well and therefore its peak mass was not determined. more isolates of the hikojima serotype, which is a rare serotype, need to be tested to determine whether this result is strain or serotype specific  <cit> . the theoretical mass of ompu of the tested strain is only one da less than that of the n <dig> ompu.

it should be noted that not all strains of serogroup o <dig> are toxigenic. some strains are not able to produce the cholera toxin because these isolates lack the ctxab and tcpa genes necessary for full virulence of v. cholerae  <cit> . furthermore, the non-toxigenic o <dig> isolates in this study were also genetically distinct from the epidemic v. cholerae o1/o <dig> cluster , indicating that other unknown virulence factors could be present in the epidemic v. cholerae o1/o <dig> cluster that are absent in non-toxigenic v. cholerae o <dig> isolates. previous studies have shown the presence of non-toxigenic v. cholerae o <dig> strains in the environment and in humans  <cit> . serotyping is therefore not a reliable method for the identification of toxigenic and epidemic v. cholerae o1/o <dig> strains. furthermore, v. cholerae non-o1/o <dig> isolates have been described that are able to produce the cholera toxin but are not considered epidemic because only strains of serogroup o1/o <dig> and o <dig> are able to cause large outbreaks  <cit> . thus, the presence of the ctxab and tcpa genes is not the only prerequisite for epidemic potential.

we have found that ompu from epidemic v. cholerae has a unique and conserved amino acid sequence, which not only can be used in the presented maldi-tof ms assay, but also in a targeted pcr method. the difference in ompu sequences between epidemic and non-epidemic isolates as well as the sequence variation among non-epidemic strains raises the question of whether this variation is due to genetic drift or specific adaptation to different niches. from a dna alignment of a  <dig>  bp region surrounding the ompu gene of seven epidemic o <dig> and five non-toxigenic strains , it became clear that the ompu gene has undergone a higher mutation rate compared to the surrounding genes and intergenic regions. this suggests that ompu has been subject to selective pressure, possibly as a result of adaptation to particular niches. a role for ompu in host colonization has been proposed, potentially in enhancing attachment to epithelia in the gut or conferring resistance to bile, ionic detergents and organic acids  <cit> . based on a three-dimensional model of v. cholerae ompu, most of the variable regions are located in regions exposed to the outside of the cell , which supports a host-dependent variation hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
each year more than half a million people develop cholera. to reduce the burden of this devastating disease, new strategies must be developed. by minimizing the spread of the pathogen, the disease incidence can be reduced. to control a cholera outbreak, quick identification at the start of a potential outbreak and rapid discrimination between epidemic v. cholerae and other v. cholerae isolates could be helpful in introducing effective hygienic measurements  <cit> . to this point, discrimination between the toxigenic and epidemic v. cholerae strains and the non-pathogenic or less pathogenic strains has required multiple tests. the deviation in amino acid sequences of ompu homologs of non-epidemic strains from those of the ompu protein of strain n <dig>  which is conserved among almost all epidemic strains, makes ompu an important biomarker to discriminate between epidemic v. cholerae o1/o <dig> and other v. cholerae isolates. the mass differences of ompu proteins resulting from this sequence variation together with the high abundance of this protein in bacteria allows for the use of maldi-tof ms analysis as a rapid and discriminatory method for identifying epidemic strains of v. cholerae. based on the described classification technique, one would maximally generate only one false negative classification when all characterized and sequenced v. cholerae isolates are screened with the developed maldi-tof ms assay.
