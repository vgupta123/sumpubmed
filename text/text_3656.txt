BACKGROUND
genetic variation in complex traits is typically due to thousands of polymorphisms each of which explains a small part  of the phenotypic variance . this makes it very difficult to identify causal variants  <cit> . even with sample sizes >  <dig> , genome wide significant associations usually explain < 25 % of phenotypic variance  <cit> . bovine milk is an important source of human nutrition and milk production traits  are typical complex traits where many loci and environmental effects influence phenotypes. although some mutations with relatively large effects on milk production traits have been identified , the majority of the genetic determinants that cause variation in milk production traits remain unknown. this is because the remaining genetic determinants explain only a small percentage of phenotypic variance for these traits and studies typically lack statistical power to confidently identify these loci. the challenge is to identify the causative mutations that underpin these qtl of small effect on a genome wide scale.

with the aim of achieving this, we describe a new approach using secondary, potentially genetically simpler, traits, where effects of mutations might be expected to be larger than for the complex trait, to map causal variants for milk production traits. although other studies have used related phenotypes or gene expression to verify qtl for complex traits, few studies use these data during the qtl discovery for small-effect  loci or when the phenotypic correlation between the traits is low  <cit> . we used a dataset of  <dig>  genotyped cows with phenotypes including milk production, and also secondary phenotypes for a subset of  <dig> of these cows including  <dig> detailed milk composition phenotypes , and gene expression on a separate sample of  <dig> cows. the aim was to use these secondary phenotypes to assist in identification and precise mapping of loci with small effects  on milk production. the power of the method is demonstrated by the identification of a qtl that affected both milk yield and phosphorous concentration in milk, centred on the gene slc37a <dig>  a phosphorous antiporter. the most significant imputed sequence variants in this region explained  <dig>  σ2
p for milk yield, and  <dig>  σ2
p for phosphorus concentration.

RESULTS
for both milk production traits and secondary traits , we estimated haplotype effects for sliding windows of 250 kb across the genome. haplotypes were derived from snp genotypes  and the effects of these haplotypes on the traits were estimated with bayesr  <cit> . we identified regions that show high variance in estimated haplotype effects for both milk production traits and secondary phenotypes. there were  <dig> regions that contained a qtl for a milk production and composition trait . as a negative control we analysed a trait with no direct relationship to milk composition  and found no significant overlap between regions with qtl for stature and milk composition traits.table  <dig> genomic regions with overlapping qtl between milk production and composition traits

milk production traits are fy = fat yield , my = milk yield , py = protein yield , f% = fat percentage in milk, p% = protein percentage in milk. milk composition traits include phosphorus , igg , κ-casein , β-lactoglobulin , calcium , sulphur  and lacto-peroxidase  concentration in milk




the  <dig> regions include several already identified as important for milk production, including abcg <dig>   <cit> , the casein complex , paep , and dgat <dig>   <cit> . these  <dig> regions can be viewed as positive controls, and in at least  <dig> of the  <dig>  the component trait would help identify the correct gene. for instance, on chromosome  <dig>  mutations near β-lactoglobulin affect the expression of the gene and hence the concentration of the β-lactoglobulin protein in milk  <cit> . for the  <dig> novel regions, there are promising candidate genes with direct links to the composition traits, including several igg receptors  on chromosome  <dig> and a calcium transporter  on chromosome  <dig> 

we investigated two regions in detail. the first is a novel region on chromosome  <dig>  where fig. 1a shows the alignment of the variance in estimated genetic merit for milk yield and phosphorus concentration centred on   <dig>  mbp. figure 1b shows that the haplotype effects for the  <dig> cows measured for the milk composition traits clearly separate into two groups, supporting the hypothesis that these haplotypes represent two alleles affecting both traits. to identify possible causal variants, we imputed genome sequence from the  <dig> bull genomes project  <cit>  into the region and used emmax  <cit>  to conduct association studies. due to the small-effect of the locus on milk production traits, the analysis of production data used a multi-trait meta-analysis  <cit>  strategy while a standard association test was conducted for milk phosphorus concentration.fig.  <dig>

peak significance for phosphorus concentration was observed for two variants mapping to intron  <dig> of the slc37a <dig> gene , both of which were also highly significant in the multi-trait meta-analysis  and in complete ld in the sequenced animals . when either of these variants was fitted as a co-variable in subsequent association analyses, there were no remaining highly significant  sequence variants in the region for either phosphorus concentration or in the multi-trait analysis . the rs <dig> variant explained  <dig>  σ2
p for milk yield, and  <dig>  σ2
p for phosphorus concentration. the effect on milk yield was confirmed using a sample of a different breed of cows  , where rs <dig> explained  <dig>  σ2

since rs <dig>  rs <dig> and all other less significantly associated polymorphisms  were non-coding, we performed association mapping for slc37a <dig> gene expression with plink  <cit>  . using high depth mammary rnaseq data from a separate group of  <dig> lactating cows, we confirmed a strong eqtl for slc37a <dig>  with peak association demonstrated for the same two snp highlighted from analyses of the milk traits . these data strongly support slc37a <dig> as the causative gene for the observed variation in these phenotypes. slc37a <dig> functions as a phosphorus:glucose-6-phosphate antiporter  <cit> . that is, it transports glucose-6-phosphate in one direction and phosphorus in the other. glucose is needed for lactose synthesis in mammary cells and lactose controls milk volume because it is the major osmotic component of milk  <cit> . in support of an antiporter hypothesis the allele that increases slc37a <dig> expression  increases milk yield  and decreases phosphorus concentration . although neither rs <dig> nor rs <dig> appear evolutionarily conserved, their uniform association across phenotypes  highlights these variants for future functional investigation. this region shows a clear link between gene function, two related phenotypes with moderate effect qtl  and a complex trait with a qtl for explaining as little as  <dig>  σ2
p.

the second region investigated was located near the casein complex on chromosome  <dig>  where there are four casein-encoding genes  in a 300 kb region. the casein proteins constitute about 80 % of the protein content in bovine milk. although protein polymorphisms have been described in these gene products for many years, their association with milk production traits including milk protein yield remains uncertain  <cit> . we imputed genome sequence into the region to conduct association and eqtl studies as for the analysis of chromosome  <dig>  the highest association in component traits was for κ-casein concentration, where  <dig> variants were in strong ld . the κ-casein eqtl analysis revealed a strong association for  <dig> variants , three of which were also genotyped in the  <dig> bull genomes dataset  <cit>  and were highly significant for κ-casein concentration. the variant most highly associated with the expression of κ-casein  also increased concentration of the protein in milk. this variant is located  <dig>  kb downstream of the gene encoding κ-casein .

the rs <dig> variant did not remove the entire qtl signal in the casein complex region. to determine if we could use the protein concentration phenotypes to distinguish between candidate genes in close proximity, we fitted rs <dig> as a co-variable in all analyses of milk production and composition traits. the most significant trait was αs1-casein concentration, where  <dig> variants were significant . neither these nor any other variants significantly affected the expression of the gene encoding αs1-casein . however we identified a snp from the list of  <dig> candidates that was the most significant variant in the holstein multi-trait analysis of milk production traits . this snp is located within an intron of csn1s <dig> and its effects validated for p% in the jersey cow population . thus, the qtl appears to affect αs1-casein production but its precise mechanism is unclear as the variant is not associated with a change in gene expression. when both the κ- and αs1-casein variants were fitted as co-variables , only weak associations for the multi-trait analyses remained .fig.  <dig> multi-trait association analysis between sequence variants and milk production traits near the casein complex, without fitting covariates  and fitting rs <dig> and rs <dig> . positions for the fitted variants are indicated by the vertical lines and the open reading frames of the casein genes are shaded




thus the casein region appears to have at least two independent qtl, represented by rs <dig> and rs <dig>  which contribute to variation in milk production traits. the first, rs <dig>  was estimated to explain  <dig>  σ2
p for p% and  <dig>  σ2
p for κ-casein concentration . the results suggest that one allele of this polymorphism, or one of those in high ld with it, increases expression of csn <dig> causing increased synthesis of the κ-casein protein, and thus an increase in κ-casein and total protein concentration in milk. the second variant, rs <dig>  was estimated to explain  <dig>  σ2
p for p% and  <dig>  σ2
p for αs1-casein concentration , although the precise mechanism by which it may modulate abundance is unclear. our study indicates little effect of the previously reported coding polymorphisms  <cit> , suggesting that the previous inconsistencies in reports were due to variation in ld between studies.

CONCLUSIONS
these analyses demonstrate the use of information from genetically simple traits  to identify qtl explaining as little as  <dig>  σ2
p in milk production traits. by leveraging the larger effect of the loci in the genetically simple traits, we were able to use records on approximately  <dig> individuals to confidently identify these loci. we attempted to identify the causative mutations underlying these qtl using imputed sequence data but there were many potential candidates in high ld and no known functional roles in the genome. we conclude that using secondary, and genetically simple, traits is a viable alternative to increasing sample size for the identification of small-effect qtl, particularly where it may take several years to accumulate sufficient additional data to attain the required increases in statistical power. our results also show that phenotypes with direct biological links to gene function are useful to distinguish between candidate genes in close proximity.
