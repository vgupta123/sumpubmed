BACKGROUND
the estrogen receptor alpha  is a member of the steroid nuclear receptor family. the gene coding for erα  is regulated by seven different promoters that yield different transcripts, making it one of the most complex genes in the human genome  <cit> . several splice variants have been described for estrogen receptor α, but whether all these variants are expressed as functional proteins with biological functions is not clear  <cit> . in the classic pathway erα undergoes a conformational change in the presence of estradiol, which leads to association with erα target genes via direct binding to regulatory elements and modulation of their expression. this basic mechanism is influenced by other regulatory factors including alternate receptor isoforms, and the stoichiometry of coactivator and corepressor proteins. coactivators have a common lxxll motif  <cit>  and after binding to the af- <dig> domain of erα, facilitate recruitment of other factors  <cit> . mutation analysis combined with crystallographic studies demonstrated that receptor-coactivator interactions are mediated through the erα helix <dig> and the lxxll motif of coactivators  <cit> . 4-hydroxytamoxifen  acts by blocking af- <dig> activity so it is an antagonist in cells where af- <dig> is dominant and a partial agonist where af- <dig> is dominant  <cit> . fulvestrant/ici  <dig>   is known to block both, af- <dig> and af- <dig> activities.

estrogens have a proliferative effect on various tissues, including the breast. thus erα plays a key role in mammary tumour development. in mammary cells, the effects of 17β-estradiol  can be antagonized by compounds such as oht, a tamoxifen metabolite that is a selective estrogen receptor modulator , and ici, a selective estrogen receptor disruptor . oht has partial agonist activity, depending on the tissue and response examined while ici compounds are totally devoid of agonist activity in the models studied to date  <cit> . erα-oht complexes accumulate in nuclei and ici treatment provokes rapid degradation of the erα-ici complex by the nuclear proteasome  <cit> .

intracellular levels of erα are downregulated in the presence of e <dig>  its cognate ligand, through the ubiquitin/proteasome  pathway  <cit> . polyubiquitination of liganded erα is catalyzed by at least three enzymes: the ubiquitine-activating enzyme e <dig> activated ubiquitin is conjugated by e <dig> with lysine residues through an isopeptide bond by the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase. polyubiquitinated erα is then directed to the proteasome for degradation  <cit> . most known ubiquitin attachment sites reside within the c-terminus of the erα. berry et al. recently also identified two receptor lysines, k <dig> and k <dig> in the hinge region of erα which are involved in e <dig> mediated and ici induced erα degradation in breast cancer cells  <cit> . although er-dependent transcription regulation and proteasome-mediated degradation of the erα are linked  <cit> , transcription per se is not required for erα degradation and assembly of the transcription-initiation complex is sufficient to target erα for degradation by the nuclear fraction of the proteasome  <cit> . using immunocytochemical studies it was shown that erα resides predominantly in the nucleus both in presence or absence of hormone  <cit> . maruvada et al.  <cit>  determined that a small proportion of transiently transfected gfp- erα exists in the cytoplasm in the absence of hormone. they proposed that unbound erα shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in living cells. estradiol and e <dig> antagonists affect erα protein turnover rates and modulate transcription of erα target genes  <cit> . it has been shown that e <dig> induced degradation of erα is necessary for its ability to rapidly activate transcription  <cit> . interestingly, two chemically different serds  competitively inhibit estradiol-mediated activation by erα and induce rapid down-regulation of the receptor  <cit> . in contrast, in the presence of tamoxifen erα protein levels increase, although the effect of oht on transcription is similar to the one observed for serd's in mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> .

in the present study we determine the impact of different ligands on nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of erα and examine the relationship between localization and proteolysis, two mechanisms involved in erα-mediated regulation in mcf- <dig> cells. to achieve this goal, we determined erα protein concentration, subnuclear localization of erα with relationship to the proteasome, and the level of esr <dig> transcription upon treatment with various antiestrogens.

RESULTS
ligands regulate erα protein levels and transcription rates independently
we first examined the kinetics of erα protein turnover in mcf- <dig> cells following treatment with estradiol , two serms  and two serds . it has been proposed that ligand dependent erα regulation may result from the presence a long aliphatic side chain on steroid core. thus in this study we selected ru <dig> and ru <dig> which are derivatives of 17β-estradiol but with different side chains. ru <dig> has a dimethyl-amino-ethoxy-phenyl side chain similar to the one in tamoxifen, while ru <dig> has a bulky hydrophobic side chain similar to the one in fulvestrant  . erα protein levels in e <dig>  ici and ru <dig> treated mcf- <dig> cells rapidly decreased . time course experiments showed that  <dig> h after e <dig> induction, the detected amount of erα protein accounted for only 40% of erα levels before treatment; after  <dig> h, erα levels were as low as 20% of the quantity of erα present in untreated cells, and after  <dig> h erα protein remained at a level equivalent to the one observed  <dig> h after addition of e <dig>  treatment with serds  resulted in >70% reduction of erα protein levels after  <dig> h,  <dig> h and even  <dig> h reaching 95% after  <dig> h exposure to ici . treatment of mcf- <dig> cells with oht or ru <dig> , two compounds classified as serm, reduced from 40% to 50% of erα protein levels at the initial  <dig> h time-point and about 20% after  <dig> h and  <dig> h treatment with oht and ru <dig>  respectively. in addition, erα protein levels were almost equivalent to the ones detected in untreated cells after  <dig> h or  <dig> h culture in the presence of oht or ru <dig>  hence, erα protein levels are stabilized by serms.

to assess whether changes in protein levels reflect variations of erα protein stability or of transcription rates of the esr <dig> gene, we quantified erα mrna accumulated following  <dig> h treatment with the different compounds . esr <dig> mrna expression was greatly reduced after treatment with erα ligands. in the presence of e <dig>  only 40% of esr <dig> mrna could be recovered. similarly, treatment with serms and serds repressed esr <dig> mrna transcription by 45%-60% relative to untreated mcf- <dig> cells. despite the fact that a reduction in erα protein levels was readily detectable after  <dig> h and significant after  <dig> h , we observed that e <dig> induced a  <dig> to  <dig> fold increase in mrna levels of the erα-target gene greb <dig> compared to mock treated cells . greb <dig> transcription was inhibited by serms and serds . these results were expected since e <dig> is known to activate this erα target gene, while serms and serds are antiestrogens and thus repress greb <dig> transcription in erα positive mammary tumour cells  <cit> .

thus, in mcf- <dig> cells, variations in erα protein levels do not necessarily correlate with esr <dig> transcription in the presence of ligands. we note that the decrease in erα protein levels is more pronounced after treatment with serds than after addition of e <dig>  while the effect of hormone and serds on esr <dig> mrna accumulation was comparable. these results indicate that reduction of erα protein levels following treatment with serds cannot be solely attributed to decreased esr <dig> mrna levels. serds apparently act both on transcription of the esr <dig> gene and on erα protein turnover. in contrast, erα protein levels appear stable after  <dig> h treatment with serms  despite reduced esr <dig> expression levels. this suggests that binding to serms stabilizes the erα.

ligands directly affect intracellular distribution and stability of erα
serms and serds can be distinguished based on molecular mechanisms  <cit> . to unambiguously determine localization of the estrogen receptor and its intracellular trafficking in response to treatment with various ligands we established a mcf- <dig> cell line stably expressing gfp-erα from a cmv promoter. it was previously shown that transiently expressed gfp-erα is functional using an estrogen response element driven luciferase reporter gene  <cit> . expression of gfp-erα in mcf- <dig> cells did reportedly not alter cell cycle progression and gfp-erα participated in estrogen target gene regulation similarly to endogenous erα  <cit> . we tagged the n-terminus of the human erα with the s65t variant of gfp for transfection and stable integration in mcf- <dig> cells. several clones were recovered and screened for total gfp-erα protein content after treatment with e <dig>  oht or ici using fluorescence microscopy and western blots. here, we selected a mcf- <dig> derived clone  expressing gfp-erα in which changes in endogenous erα protein levels in response to a  <dig> h treatment with e <dig>  oht and ici were identical to the ones observed in mcf- <dig> cells . in addition, mrna expression levels of some erα target genes, esr <dig>  tff1/ps <dig>  greb <dig> and pgr, were verified in the selected clone sk <dig> and compared to gene expression levels in mcf- <dig> cells . mrna levels of the progesterone receptor gene  and greb <dig> increased rapidly after addition of  <dig> nm e <dig> to cells grown in steroid free medium to reach  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold  for both genes, and after  <dig> h to reach from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold for pgr and  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold for greb <dig> gene, in mcf- <dig> and sk <dig> cells respectively. tff <dig> mrna also accumulated after  <dig> h e <dig> treatment to reach  <dig>  fold in both cell lines. as expected, esr <dig> transcription was reduced in the presence of e <dig>  the rplpo gene is not a target of erα and its expression levels were insensitive to hormone addition. expression levels of all tested genes were similar in sk <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells. thus the presence of gfp-erα does not alter hormone-responsiveness at the transcriptional level.

in sk <dig> cells, gfp-erα protein accounted for 50% of total erα  in untreated cells. in the presence of e <dig> both gfp-erα and endogenous erα protein levels are reduced . the cmv promoter being insensitive to e <dig> and antiestrogens, gfp-erα protein levels are unlikely to be transcriptionally regulated. this observation together with the results shown in figure  <dig> provides evidence that erα protein turnover is regulated directly by binding of the receptor to ligands and its subsequent degradation.

previous studies have demonstrated that gfp-erα resides predominantly in the nucleus in transiently transfected mammary tumour cell lines  <cit> , hela cells  <cit>  and in mcf- <dig> cells expressing gfp-erα from an inducible promoter  <cit> . these microscopy based observations largely contradict results based on cellular fractionation which suggest that large amounts of erα, in the absence or the presence of ligands, associate with the cytoplasmic fraction  <cit> . it has been proposed that the relative amount of cytoplasmic erα is indicative of the mechanism of action of certain antiestrogens  <cit> . commonly used cell fractionation protocols include a detergent based extraction step. importantly, erα and other nuclear receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor  are easily extracted from the nucleus in the presence of low concentrations of detergents such as np <dig> . as a consequence, apparent enrichment of erα or gr in the cytoplasm likely results from the extraction protocol rather than a specific behavior of nuclear receptors. here, we used a digitonin based cell fractionation protocol to determine the distribution of unbound and ligand-bound erα and gfp-erα in different cellular compartments . effectiveness of the fractionation protocol  was confirmed using lamin a for the nuclear insoluble fractions, cytokeratin  <dig> for the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and α-tubulin for the cytoplasmic fraction . treatment of cells with e <dig> and various antiestrogens did not affect cellular distribution of these proteins. we found that endogenous erα associates predominantly with the nuclear fraction in the sk <dig> cells. in untreated cells, the part of erα retained in the cytoplasm corresponded to ~20% of total endogenous erα detected using the hc- <dig> antibody . similarly, the bulk of gfp-erα, detected using either the hc- <dig> antibody or an antibody directed against gfp, was found in the nucleus. following addition of e <dig>  we note an overall decrease in erα protein levels that could mainly be attributed to a reduction in nuclear erα . treatment of sk <dig> cells with serds, ici or ru <dig> leads to a decrease in overall erα protein levels as shown for mcf- <dig> cells in figure 1b. notably, the remaining erα was concentrated in the nuclear insoluble fraction which corresponded to ≥40% of total erα in the presence of either ici or ru <dig>  suggesting that the nuclear soluble fraction was rapidly degraded. in contrast, we found that treatment with oht and ru <dig>  resulted in a cellular distribution similar to the one observed in untreated cells  where at least 50% of erα protein remained in a soluble nuclear compartment. our cellular fractionation protocol is robust since the effects of various ligands are reproducible inside each category: oht and ru <dig> induce the same effect on erα protein distribution and this effect is distinct from the one of ici and ru <dig>  in addition, we show that occupation of different cellular compartments by gfp-erα reflected the localization of endogenous erα as detected by fluorescence imaging .

ligands induce specific intracellular relocalization of gfp-erα
gfp-erα can be visualized in sk <dig> cells using conventional wide-field microscopy. sk <dig> cells were cultured on conventional glass microscopy coverslips in phenol-red free media for  <dig> days. culture conditions were identical to conditions used for cell fractionation, immunoblotting or rna extraction prior to rt-qpcr. figure 3a shows representative images of sk <dig> cells treated or not with e <dig>  serms and serds. we note that in the sk <dig> cell line gfp-erα was excluded from the nucleoli, as previously observed for the cellular distribution of endogenous erα in mcf- <dig> cells  <cit>  and of transiently transfected gfp-erα  <cit> , under all conditions tested. exposure times were identical for all conditions examined by fluorescence microscopy.

in untreated cells, erα was uniformly distributed in the nucleus , to the dapi  nuclear stain in figure 3aa). a linear scan across the entire field including cytoplasm and nucleus  shows that the cytoplasmic gfp-erα fluorescence was barely above background  which correlates with observations from cell fractionation experiments . in the presence of e <dig>  gfp-erα rapidly relocalized to accumulate in numerous foci scattered throughout the nucleoplasm . in e <dig> treated cells, no gfp-erα fluorescence could be detected in the cytoplasm . in contrast, after  <dig> h treatment with serms, oht or ru <dig>  we did not observe any intranuclear reorganization of gfp-erα compared to untreated cells. this observation also correlates with our fractionation experiments . gfp-erα staining remained diffuse with fluorescence intensity comparable to mock cells . however, again no cytoplasmic gfp-erα could be detected.

the distribution of the intensity of the fluorescent signals was determined within nuclei excluding the nucleolus. the frequency of pixels with respect to their intensity allows to calculate a coefficient of variation . in cells treated with serms the cv was comparable to the one in control cells while the cv was  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher in cells exposed to e <dig> or serds . this quantitive measure strengthens our observation that erα accumulates in intranuclear foci when bound to e <dig> or serds but not in the presence of serms.

cv
coefficients of variation of fluorescent intensities were measured after treatment with  <dig> nm e <dig> and anti-estrogens as described in methods. the distribution of the intensity of the fluorescent signals was determined within nuclei excluding the nucleolus in mcf- <dig> cells .

upon exposure to serds, both ici and ru <dig>  gfp-erα accumulated at numerous sites, reminiscent of the ones observed in the presence of e <dig> . we ascertained that the fluorescent foci detected in sk <dig> cells correspond to an accumulation of endogeneous erα using immuno-electron microscopy of mcf- <dig> cells. several immunogold labeled erα molecules were frequently detected within ~ <dig> nm distance from each other in  <dig> nm thin sections of e <dig> or ici treated cells .

in addition, in sk <dig> cells, the maximum fluorescence intensity measured after e <dig> and ici treatments decreased by 20-40% as compared to untreated cells consistent with degradation of gfp-erα . the effects of ici and ru <dig> were indistinguishable suggesting that both molecules operate via similar molecular mechanisms despite significant structural differences  <cit> .

proteasome-dependent degradation of erα bound to e <dig> or serds
erα is a short-lived protein   <cit> . erα degradation occurs in presence of natural ligands  or pure antiestrogens such as ici in a proteasome dependent manner  <cit> .

the 26s proteasome is a large protein complex  present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of eukaryotic cells. the catalytic core of this multi-subunit complex, described as the 20s proteasome, contains α and β subunits  <cit> . we visualized gfp-erα and the 20s proteasome subunit α <dig> in sk <dig> cells. sk <dig> cells grown on glass coverslips and treated as described were fixed, permeabilized and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal anti-20s proteasome subunit α <dig> primary antibody. images acquired on an olympus inverted wide-field microscope in  <dig> d and subjected to deconvolution revealed punctuate nuclear staining of proteasome subunits throughout the nucleus . we did not observe any cytoplasmic staining of this proteasome subunit under our culture conditions. in the presence of e <dig>  gfp-erα accumulated at numerous nuclear sites that colocalized at least partially with proteasome foci .

next we used a double-immuno-nanogold labelling approach in mcf- <dig> cells to characterize the extent of er/α <dig> colocalization. upon exposure to e <dig>  at least four nuclear clusters per nuclear sections were detected. in the majority of clusters more than  <dig> gold particles for each protein were present . endogenous erα  colocalized with the 20s proteasome subunit α <dig>  in nuclear microdomains of about  <dig> nm in diameter .

we then determined the effect of lmb , an inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor crm <dig>  and of alln , an inhibitor of the proteasome, on serd-dependent degradation of erα in sk <dig> cells. sk <dig> cells were pretreated with  <dig> nm lmb or  <dig> μm alln for  <dig> min. figure 4c shows that lmb did not block e <dig>  ici or ru <dig> induced erα degradation suggesting that serd-bound erα is degraded in the nucleus. in the presence of e <dig>  but not ici or ru <dig>  degradation was slightly less pronounced in cells pretreated with lmb suggesting that a fraction of e <dig> bound erα is also degraded by the cytoplasmic proteasome. furthermore, alln inhibited e <dig>  ici and ru <dig> induced degradation of erα confirming that serd-erα complexes were degraded by the nuclear proteasome . note that at the protein level, gfp-erα is degraded to a lesser extent than endogenous erα which is likely to be a consequence of reduced transcription of esr <dig> in the presence of e <dig> and serds. gfp-erα transcription is under the control of a cmv promoter which insensitive to antiestrogens.

finally, we investigated the distribution of gfp-erα and the 20s proteasome subunit α <dig> in sk <dig> cells treated with ici or ru <dig> . gfp-erα foci also significantly overlapped with accumulation sites of the 20s proteasome subunit α <dig> throughout the nucleus . on average we observed larger and more frequent gfp-erα-proteasome complexes in the presence of serds than in the presence of e <dig> consistent with the fact that erα is readily degraded when erα is bound to serds. as a consequence of the alln treatment, contacts between gfp-erα and proteasome foci were largely abolished .

interestingly, in a few cells treated with either e <dig> or serds we observed a single very large site of accumulation of the 20s proteasome α <dig> subunit . these sites, also called clastosomes, were reported to colocalize with the c-jun and c-fos proteins  <cit> , very unstable proteins with half lives of less than  <dig> min. in our cells, clastosomes did not colocalize with gfp-erα foci which may indicate that e <dig> bound erα is more stable than c-jun and/or c-fos proteins.

discussion
the available quantity of erα is a limiting factor in the response to ligands, estrogen and antiestrogens. thus, determination of erα cell content in patients is not only the first parameter for tumour classification, but also a powerful tool to predict response to hormone-therapies. erα protein levels vary under physiological states, during tumor progression, and beyond therapy  <cit> . erα protein levels are tightly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and loss of this control is associated with hormone insensitivity in breast cancer  <cit> .

most members of the nuclear receptor superfamily form focal accumulations within the nucleus in response to hormone  <cit> . receptors undergo constant exchange between target sequences, multi-protein complexes including a variety of transcription factors, as well as subnuclear structures that are as yet poorly defined. the estrogen receptor alpha is found almost exclusively in the nucleus, both in hormone stimulated and untreated cells which makes it an exception among nuclear receptors which generally translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus upon hormone stimulation. hager and colleagues  <cit>  proposed that distribution of the erα is dependent not only on localization signals, but also on the nature and composition of the associated macromolecular complexes. formation of these complexes depends on the nature of the ligand bound to erα. thus, as demonstrated here, ligands directly affect the nuclear fate of the receptor.

we created a mcf- <dig> cell line stably expressing gfp-tagged human erα to levels equivalent to endogenous erα, to determine the localization of ligand-bound gfp-erα in mammary tumor cells. we demonstrate that few hours after treatment cellular localization of the erα correlates with the nature of the ligand independently of its impact on transcription.

in the presence of e <dig> and serms which induce binding of erα to target sequences and subsequent formation of macromolecular complexes, the small cytoplasmic fraction of e <dig> bound erα rapidly translocated into the nucleus suggesting that dna binding attracts cytoplasmic erα. in contrast, serd bound cytoplasmic erα was retained in the cytoplasm. serds induce a conformational change of erα independently of its localization  which leads to its rapid degradation. our data also corroborate recent observations by long and co-workers  <cit>  that ici induces specific nuclear matrix interaction of protein-erα complexes with cytokeratins  <dig> and  <dig> which mediate immobilization and turnover of erα. a non direct role of erα in the cytoplasm has been proposed to play a role in acquired resistance to antiestrogens, in particular oht  <cit> . indeed, in oht resistant cells, the erα accumulated in the cytoplasm, suggesting that serm stimulated erα relocalization into the nucleus may be necessary for anti-hormone effectiveness . an attractive possibility would thus reside in not only blocking indirect erα functions which rely on mek/erk and pi3k pathways in serm resistant tumors, but to increase erα translocation into the nucleus.

the crystal structure of erα bound to different ligands has revealed a spectrum of conformational states  <cit>  that involve the repositioning of helix h <dig> of the receptor's ligand binding domain and formation the receptor's cofactor associating surfaces. it was proposed that the ligand binding cavity has a remarkable plasticity with a preferential binding mode for distal hydroxyl groups  <cit>  showing similar orientations for distal side chains in α or β positions of different ligands  <cit> . ru <dig> and ru <dig> are derivatives of 17β-estradiol but with different side chains. the shorter dimethyl-amino-ethoxy-phenyl side chain is similar to the one in 4-hydroxytamoxifen and likely to be easily accommodated by the cavity . in contrast, ru <dig> has a bulky hydrophobic side chain similar to the one in fulvestrant  which hampers the folding of helix  <dig>  thus the molecular structure of erα ligands alone indicates the potential for serm or serd -like activities of the compound .

interestingly, e <dig> induced focal accumulations of erα scattered throughout the nucleus in the presence of e <dig> and of serds . in agreement with this observation, numerous erα-rich domains of about  <dig> nm are detectable following e <dig> stimulation . it is well established that upon e <dig> addition, erα binds to promoter of erα-target genes  <cit> . stimulated genes are found at numerous sites in the nucleus similarly to erα protein  <cit> . thus, we propose that the observed erα rich nuclear clusters correspond to association of the receptor with chromatin structures of erα-responsive genes and the proteasome  to ensure its own turnover while target genes are being transcribed. similarly, serd-bound erα also concentrated into nuclear foci  which frequently colocalize with the proteasome independently of dna binding. this may explain why ligand bound erα is less dynamic, and appears more strongly associated with nuclear matrix like structures  <cit> .

thus we propose a simple explanation reconciling all previous observations of erα dynamics: ligands that allow erα to bind its target sequence and to recruit macromolecular complexes induce erα nuclear degradation or accumulation ; ligands that bind to erα but do not lead to dna binding due to conformational changes of the receptor do not induce relocalization of the receptor, but accelerate its degradation ; finally, ligands that induce association of erα with the proteasome  lead to focal accumulations and immobilize the erα. it is the association with the proteasome  <cit>  and not active degradation by the proteasome that leads to erα sequestration.

in the last  <dig> years clinical use of tamoxifen significantly improved survival rates of patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer types. however, resistance to this therapy arises frequently and numerous side effects exist. since it is well established that total erα content correlates with tumor growth in response to different ligands, it is crucial to characterize the exact mechanisms involved in anti-estrogen action and the impact of their structure on erα conformation, co-factor recruitment and cellular compartmentalization. knowledge of these parameters may allow to develop new compounds useful for patients resistant to existing therapies but may also benefit early diagnostics and treatment design.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion the results of this study indicate the impact of the estradiol and several serm and serd compounds, in particular ru <dig>  and ru <dig> , on nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and protein turnover of estrogen receptor alpha  in human breast cancer cell lines. we found that ligands directly affect the nuclear fate and protein turnover of the receptor independently of their impact on transcription.
