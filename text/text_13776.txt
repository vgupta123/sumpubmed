BACKGROUND
escherichia coli  o <dig> is a bacterial pathogen capable of causing potentially fatal gastrointestinal disease in humans. in  <dig> there were a total of  <dig> laboratory confirmed infections in the uk  <cit> .  <dig> of these cases occurred in scotland where the rate of infections per hundred thousand is consistently higher than in the rest of the uk <cit> . e. coli o <dig> is shed by cattle, which are believed to be a major reservoir for human infections. phage type  21/ <dig> is a subtype of e. coli o <dig> that was first detected in scotland in  <dig>  <cit> . by  <dig> this pt dominated scottish clinical cases, accounting for roughly two thirds of human isolates  <cit> . pt 21/ <dig> is of particular concern because of its association with severe morbidity. haemolytic uraemic syndrome  is a potentially fatal complication of e. coli o <dig> infection. a recent survey of hus cases in the uk and ireland indicated that the risk of developing diarrhoea-associated hus was significantly higher in children in scotland infected with pt 21/ <dig> than with the majority of other pts  <cit> .

the aims of this study were to use data collected during a survey of scottish cattle farms to estimate the prevalence of pt 21/ <dig>  to investigate the association between pt and the count of e. coli o <dig> in faecal pats, and to identify risk factors for the presence of pt 21/ <dig> at the farm level relative to other pts.

methods
study group and sampling protocol
the study group comprised  <dig> scottish cattle farms on which the presence of e. coli o <dig> was identified during a larger cross-sectional survey of  <dig> farms conducted from february  <dig> to february  <dig>  the  <dig> study farms were stratified into  <dig> regions, corresponding to the six scottish animal health divisions recognised by the scottish executive environment and rural affairs department . within each region, farms were sampled throughout the  <dig> year period in clusters of three. the principal farm in each cluster was selected at random and a list of the six farms nearest to it but within the same region was drawn up. following consent to visit the principal farm, farms on the list of six were approached sequentially to identify a sampling cluster of three participating farms. farms in the same cluster were visited on the same or contiguous days. on each farm, groups of store and finishing cattle were identified and sampled. the number of faecal pats sampled in each group was determined from the number of cattle in the group using a prescribed sampling schedule. for each group, sufficient pat samples were taken to ensure 90% probability of detecting shedding of e. coli o <dig> if on average 8% of animals were shedding in positive groups, with shedding distributed as seen in an earlier study commissioned by the scottish executive environment and rural affairs department. faecal samples were refrigerated at 5°c. the majority were refrigerated within two hours of sampling, while a small number were held at ambient temperature before refrigeration on the day after sample collection.

laboratory analysis
within  <dig> hours faecal samples were examined by immunomagnetic separation  to detect the presence of e. coli o <dig> as described by pearce et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . to estimate e. coli o <dig> counts,  <dig> g of faeces from each e. coli o <dig> positive sample was suspended in  <dig> ml of maximum recovery diluent  and  <dig>  ml of suspension spread onto each of two ct-smac plates. plates were incubated at 42°c for  <dig> hours. typical non-sorbitol fermenting colonies were counted and tested using anti-e. coli o <dig> coated latex reagent . the limit of accurate enumeration using this method was  <dig> colony forming units g- <dig> faeces  <cit> . one e. coli o <dig> isolate from each faecal sample was submitted to the scottish e. coli o <dig> reference laboratory for phage typing  <cit>  and screened for genes encoding the virulence factors verocytotoxin  <dig> , verocytotoxin  <dig>  and intimin   <cit> .

classification of farm status and questionnaire survey
e. coli o <dig> was identified on  <dig> of the  <dig> farms in the full study. due to an incomplete data set, three farms were excluded and  <dig> farms were included in this analysis. laboratory data were binary coded to establish the probability of observing pt 21/ <dig> presence on e. coli o <dig> positive farms. a farm was classified as positive for pt 21/ <dig> if at least one e. coli o <dig> isolate from that farm was of this pt. farms were classified as negative if all isolates from the farm were phage typed and none were pt 21/ <dig>  on each sampling visit a confidential questionnaire was administered by one of three individuals, to gather information on the farm environment, the types of livestock present, the farm location and the housing, feed and management of the sample groups. the number of e. coli o <dig> positive pats on each farm was recorded and analysed as a predictor variable.

risk factor analysis
generalised linear modelling was carried out to identify variables associated with pt 21/ <dig> presence. initially,  <dig> variables were individually tested for association with pt 21/ <dig> presence in a univariate generalised linear model  with a logistic link function. all variables with univariate likelihood ratio test p ≤  <dig>  were carried forward to a multiple variable analysis. the multiple variable model was constructed through forward selection. variables were added to the null model in order of decreasing significance until no further variables were significant at p ≤  <dig> . at each step all variables were checked to ensure that they maintained significance at p ≤  <dig> . finally, the multiple variable model was fitted as a generalised linear mixed model  with sampling cluster fitted as the random effect to account for the clustering in sample design. the multiple variable glm models constructed through forward selection were assessed using hosmer & lemeshow diagnostic plots  <cit> . to identify any problems with collinearity, variable coefficients from the multiple variable models were compared with the corresponding univariate glm coefficient to look for marked changes in direction or magnitude of effect in the multiple variable models. all two-way interactions were also tested.

analysis of bacterial counts
e. coli o <dig> count data were categorised, and a contingency table comparing the counts of pat samples containing a pt 21/ <dig> isolate to the counts of samples containing a non-pt 21/ <dig> e. coli o <dig> isolate was constructed. the association between e. coli o <dig> type  and count category was assessed using a chi-square test. all analysis was conducted using r , isbn 3-900051-07-0).

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> e. coli o <dig> isolates from  <dig> farms were phage typed and tested for the presence of common virulence genes. isolates of  <dig> different pts were found but there was a clear predominance of pt 21/ <dig>  . pt 21/ <dig> was present on 50/ <dig> e. coli o <dig> positive farms . the presence of e. coli o <dig> isolates of only one pt was recorded on  <dig> of the  <dig> farms, including  <dig> farms on which only pt 21/ <dig> was found. pt 21/ <dig> was also identified on  <dig> of the  <dig> farms on which isolates of two or three different pts were present. all but  <dig> e. coli o <dig> isolates carried the eae gene encoding intimin, 98% carried the vtx <dig> verocytotoxin gene and only  <dig> isolates carried neither the vtx <dig> or vtx <dig> gene.

one hundred and nine variables were tested for association with pt 21/ <dig> presence and  <dig> were significant at p ≤  <dig> . no variables concerning housing, the use of manure, the use of slurry, or cattle feed were significant. in the final multiple variable glmm three fixed effects were found to be formally statistically significant . no interaction terms were significant.

farms on which the water supply to the farmhouse was from the mains  were significantly less likely to be infected with pt 21/ <dig> than farms that had a private water supply  . this variable refers to farmhouse water supply rather than cattle water supply. however,  <dig> of  <dig> farms with a mains supply to the farmhouse also had a mains water supply for their cattle and there is highly significant correlation between the farmhouse and cattle water sources . the presence of pt 21/ <dig> on a farm was positively associated with the number of pat samples from the farm that were positive for e. coli o <dig> . the y coordinate of the farm was associated with the presence of pt 21/ <dig>  such that more northerly farms were more likely to be infected with pt 21/ <dig> . the odds ratio values for the number of e. coli o <dig> positive samples and y coordinate represent a change in the odds of pt 21/ <dig> presence per unit increase in the predictor variables – increases of a single positive pat sample and  <dig> km northing respectively.

analysis of e. coli counts revealed that pt 21/ <dig> isolates were significantly associated with categorized e. coli o <dig> counts . e. coli o <dig> positive pat samples containing a pt 21/ <dig> isolate were underrepresented in the smaller count categories and overrepresented in the larger count categories, as compared to samples containing a non-pt 21/ <dig> isolate .

discussion
approximately half  of the e. coli o <dig> isolates analysed in this study were pt 21/ <dig>  and this pt was present on  <dig> % of e. coli o <dig> positive study farms. three statistically significant risk factors specific to pt 21/ <dig> presence have been identified. farms on which the farmhouse water was supplied from the mains were significantly less likely to be infected with pt 21/ <dig> than farms that had a private water supply. the presence of e. coli o <dig> in a cattle water supply is positively associated with the presence and extent of faecal shedding   <cit> . the association seen here between pt 21/ <dig> presence and a private water supply suggests that waterborne transmission may play a particularly important role in the transmission of pt 21/ <dig> e. coli o <dig>  the latitude of the farm is also associated with the likelihood of pt 21/ <dig> presence, such that farms located further north are more likely to have cattle shedding pt 21/ <dig>  investigation of climatic and farm management factors that may vary with latitude, and specific spatial analyses of the distribution of pt 21/ <dig> isolates may identify further potentially important risk factors for pt 21/ <dig> presence.

the analysis of the bacterial count data reveals that pt 21/ <dig> isolates are associated with larger e. coli o <dig> counts . only one e. coli o <dig> isolate from each pat sample was characterised, but pilot studies indicated that a single isolate type tends to dominate within individual pat samples. the association between the presence of pt 21/ <dig> and an increased number of e. coli o <dig> positive pat samples is difficult to interpret and could simply reflect an increased likelihood of finding any phage type when a greater number of e. coli o <dig> isolates are tested. however, on 76%  of the farms on which pt 21/ <dig> was present, pt 21/ <dig> was the only phage type identified, even though some of these farms had as many as  <dig> positive isolates. previous studies have identified an association between the presence of supershedding cattle on a farm and low level shedding in other individuals  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study was carried out using a limited data set including  <dig> farms on which e. coli o <dig> was present. however, this work has led to a determination of the prevalence of pt 21/ <dig> on e. coli o <dig> positive scottish cattle farms, the identification of a significant association between pt 21/ <dig> presence and larger counts of e. coli o <dig> in faecal pats and the identification of statistically significant risk factors specific to pt 21/ <dig> e. coli o <dig>  if different phage types of e. coli o <dig> have different risk factors and ecology, the concentration of future research efforts upon particular subtypes may allow the identification of more specifically relevant risk factors. pt 21/ <dig> has emerged relatively recently in scotland, effectively superseding previously dominant phage types. by recognising the heterogeneity within the total e. coli o <dig> population and concentrating future research upon more specific sub-populations such as pt 21/ <dig> it may be possible to gain more accurate and informative data about the ecology and control of e. coli o <dig> overall.
