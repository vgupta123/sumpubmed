BACKGROUND
langurs of the asian colobine genus presbytis  are exclusively arboreal animals, which inhabit tropical rainforest habitats of sundaland, i.e., the malay peninsula and the western indo-malay archipelago, comprising of sumatra, borneo, java, the mentawai islands and some smaller interjacent islands  <cit> . mainly driven by sundaland's dramatic geological and climatic changes during the past million years, the genus has undergone an extensive radiation  <cit> . with more than  <dig> described color variants  <cit> , presbytis is one of the most diverse primate genera among old world monkeys.

like many other primate species, surilis emit loud, conspicuous vocalizations termed loud-calls or long-distance calls. in contrast to presbytis, gibbon loud-calls have a well-adapted acoustic structure  <cit> ; with an energy concentration in single frequency bands, a slow modulation of song elements and a transmission range adjusted to the frequency window of rainforest conditions, their songs can be heard over several miles  <cit> . although less well optimized, loud-calls produced by other nonhuman primate species, such as howler monkeys  <cit>  or surilis  <cit> , also exhibit adaptations for long-distance transmission. loud-calls can have a variety of different functions; they may be used to defend resources, to compete for mates, to mediate intergroup spacing and to promote intragroup cohesion  <cit> . in those species in which the structure of loud-calls is well adapted to long-distance transmission, they function predominantly to mark and defend territories.

although there is general agreement that loud-calls may also serve as phylogenetic traits, systematic studies comparing call structure and genetic relatedness are rare. amongst gibbons, structural differences are routinely used as a taxonomic tool  <cit> . in a recent study on crested gibbons carried out in  <dig> different locations in vietnam, laos and cambodia, thinh and colleagues  <cit>  combined a molecular genetic analysis with an acoustic analysis and showed that song structure alone can be used to distinguish the different species. based on call structure, the authors were also able to distinguish single populations and support not only their phylogentic relatedness, but also their proposed geographic origins. comparable studies in other nonhuman primates are lacking. however, single studies on loud-calls of orangutans  <cit> , thomas langurs  <cit> , chimpanzees  <cit> , black-and-white colobus monkeys  <cit>  or sportive lemurs  <cit>  revealed geographic or genetic related differences in the structure of loud-calls of these species. some previous studies proposed that loud-calls of surilis could be a useful tool to characterize phylogenetic relatedness  <cit> . according to these studies, the sumatran surilis were divided into the species p.melalophos, p.femoralis, p.thomasi  <cit>  and p.potenziani  <cit> , and wilson and wilson  <cit>  proposed a successive invasion of sumatra, borneo and the mentawai islands from the asian mainland. however, all these studies are only based on phonetic descriptions of loud-calls and did not make a systematic analysis of the acoustic structure or a direct comparison between acoustic structure and genetic relatedness.

here we combine the results of the most comprehensive molecular genetic study on leaf monkeys of the genus presbytis currently available  <cit>  with a systematic field survey in which the loud-calls of p.potenziani siberu, p.comata comata, p.thomasi and the four subspecies of p.melalophos  were recorded  <cit> . previous classifications and phylogenies of presbytis were mainly based on behavioral and anatomical features, in particular coat coloration  <cit> , while genetic studies are extremely limited  <cit> . in our recent study  <cit> , mitochondrial dna was used to propose a revision of groves' classification  <cit>  suggesting species status for the four subspecies of p.melalophos and also for both subspecies of p.comata and p.potenziani. however, for convenience we use here the classification of groves  <cit> .

since surilis intensively responds to stranger call playbacks  <cit> , we used a playback design in order to collect vocalization data under comparable conditions. we hypothesized that, similar to crested gibbons, structural differences in presbytis loud-calls reflect phylogenetic relationships and can support a revision of the current classification.

RESULTS
in  <dig> and  <dig>  we conducted field surveys in  <dig> locations  on sumatra, java and the mentawai islands, and recorded male loud-calls of seven wild non-habituated presbytis taxa . included are p.thomasi, p.potenziani siberu, p.comata comata and all four subspecies of p.melalophos . in total, we recorded more than  <dig> loud-calls of  <dig> male individuals.

in response to the playbacks, males often responded several times, but only one call of this bout was used for the analysis . counter calling males in general decreased the distance to the speaker, while females hid or disappeared. a further common response to playback treatments was alarm calling of group members and in addition juveniles often started to squeal  <cit> . loud-calls were mostly accompanied by a jumping display.

general differences in male loud-calls
p.thomasi, p.potenziani, p.comata and p.melalophos can be clearly identified by general acoustic characteristics in their call structure . in addition, species' calls are readily distinguished by ear, but p.melalophos subspecific differences are undetectable.

p.thomasi  and p.potenziani  calls start with coughing elements at the beginning and end with howling tonal phrases. these two parts include inhalation and exhalation elements. in p.thomasi, the initial coughing elements rise in crescendo and increase in volume . in p. potenziani , the build-up phase is missing and the coughing elements are equally loud and noisy . both loud-calls also differ in their mean duration with  <dig>  s  for p.thomasi and  <dig>  s  for p.potenziani. on the average, p.potenziani produces  <dig> elements  per call with a mean element frequency of  <dig>  per second , while p.thomasi produces  <dig> elements  with a mean element frequency of  <dig>  elements/s  . detailed differences in the acoustic structure can be found in additional file  <dig> 

the typical p.comata call  is characterized by a unique staccato-like sequence of  <dig>  alternating exhalation and inhalation elements . p.comata calls, with a mean call duration of  <dig>  s , include a short build-up phase and an end-up phase, both with increasing loudness and frequency .

loud-calls of p.m.bicolor , p.m.sumatrana , the central sumatran p.m.mitrata  and p.m.melalophos  from outside of bengkulu, consist of a sequence of exhalation elements. an exception are the calls of p.m.melalophos from bengkulu  and the southern sumatran p.m.mitrata , which differ by producing alternating exhalation and inhalation elements at the end of the call . the mean duration of p.melalophos calls lies between  <dig>  s  for p.m.mitrata and  <dig>  s  for p.m.sumatrana. the mean frequency of produced elements lies between  <dig>  elements/s,  for p.m.mitrata and  <dig>  elements/s  for p.m.bicolor .

no misclassification can be found between the four presbytis species, p.comata , p.melalophos , p.potenziani  and p.thomasi . they form four well separated clusters with a correct assignment of 100% . among the large p.melalophos cluster, one further sub-cluster is indicated, which includes p.m.melalophos from bengkulu  and the southern sumatran p.m.mitrata . the scattergram  shows the separation of the  <dig> populations according to the first and second discriminant function, explaining  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total acoustic variation, respectively. the first discriminant function, which mainly represents the amount of inhalation elements, separates populations 1- <dig> from all others, while the second discriminant function, which represents rhythmical features, separates population  <dig> from all others. to focus on the p.melalophos cluster , we conducted a second dfa.

result of the discriminant function analysis of p.melalophos populations 
the second dfa <dig> assigns  <dig> % of the loud-calls  to the original populations and establishes three distinct clusters , separating the southern sumatran p.m.mitrata  and the p.m.melalophos from bengkulu  from the remaining p.melalophos populations.

in relation to the taxon identity 89% p.m.mitrata, 76% p.m.melalophos, 93% p.m.bicolor and 63% p.m.sumatrana of the cross-validated population cases are correctly classified . the scattergram  shows the separation of the  <dig> populations according to the first and second discriminant function, explaining  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total variation, respectively. the first discriminant function, which explains nearly all structural differences, represents the amount of inhalation elements, separates populations 4- <dig> from population  <dig>  and the remaining populations. the second discriminant function mainly based on the minimum frequency of the call, indicates the separation of populations  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from population  <dig> and the lasting locations.

phylogenetic relationships among presbytis taxa based on acoustic data and comparison with molecular data
the vocal-  and molecular-based phylogenies   <cit>  are highly congruent. in both phylogenies, p.thomasi, p.potenziani, p.melalophos  and p.comata + p.m.mitrata from south sumatra form four distinct clusters/lineages and indicate a similar branching pattern. contrary to the molecular phylogeny, in the acoustic tree p.m.mitrata from south sumatra  does not form a monophyletic cluster, and p.m.sumatrana  and p.m.bicolor  are nested within the cluster consisting of p.m.melaophos and p.m.mitrata from central sumatra . this might be due to the subtle differences found in the vocal structure of respective populations.

correlation between vocal structure, genetic and geographical distance
a mantel test was performed to test the concordance between genetic distance, geographical distance and acoustic similarity. all populations where corresponding genetic data was available  were included in the analysis . we found the highest significant correlations between vocal structure and genetic distance , and lower significant correlations between genetic and geographical distance , and geographical distance and vocal structure .

discussion
here we report significant differences between loud-call structures of p.thomasi, p.potenziani, p.comata and p.melalophos. among the latter species a significant separation between the south sumatran p.m.mitrata and the central sumatran p.m.mitrata, as well as a further separation between p.m.melalophos from bengkulu and the remaining p.m.melalophos populations, could be detected. the acoustic discrimination between presbytis taxa was highly positively correlated with their genetic distance. in addition, we found substantial significant correlations between acoustic similarity and geographic distance and between genetic distance and geographic distance.

in our recent molecular genetic study  <cit>  we suggested a paraphyly for p.m.mitrata, with the central sumatran populations being closely related to p.m.melalophos and the south sumatran populations forming a sister lineage to p.comata . our current findings on the acoustic structure of loud-calls strongly support these results.

p.m.mitrata was reported to inhabit the area southeast of the batang hari river, a large river in central sumatra. in the west, this subspecies does not extend to the bukit barisan range, a mountain range on the western side of sumatra  <cit> , where p.m.melalophos occurs  <cit> . our samples of the central sumatran p.m.mitrata  derived from the above described northernmost distribution range of this subspecies, south of the batang hari river. although much paler, the morphological appearance resembles the reddish p.m.melalophos more than the grayish white southern sumatran p.m.mitrata . whether there might be a transition zone between p.m.melalophos and p.m.mitrata demands further research. it is highly likely that p.m.melalophos gradually intergrades with p.m.mitrata, as may be the case between p.m.bicolor and p.m.melalophos  <cit> . our results, however, let us conclude that the central sumatran p.m.mitrata population is the paler color variant of p.m.melalophos. thus, the geographical distribution range of p.m.melalophos should be extended from the bukit barisan range eastwards towards jambi. the southern sumatran p.m.mitrata is genetically, morphologically and acoustically distinct from the remaining p.melalophos subspecies . therefore, if the phylogenetic species concept  <cit>  is applied, p.m.mitrata would be elevated to a monotypic species p.mitrata eschscholtz,  <dig>  <cit> .

among p.m.melalophos we found the calls from bengkulu  forming a distinct cluster. unfortunately, genetic data from bengkulu are lacking, but acoustically, the call types were more closely related to the southern p.m.mitrata mainly due to the presence of inhalation elements. historically different color morphs of p.m.melalophos were described, all of which are currently classified as synonyms of p.m.melalophos  <cit> . these are a) the much less red and buffer variant from bengkulu , b) a foxy red northern form  from solok  <cit> , c) a less reddish form from padang  and d) a golden buff variant  from gunung talamau   <cit> . the great diversity of color morphs in presbytis, in particular in p.melalophos, has caused much debate over the past decades. coloration might indicate relatedness, but can often be misleading, in particular, when no broad geographic sampling is available. our data point out that the taxonomic ranking of some of these historically described taxa possibly should be reconsidered. however, the loud-calls from population  <dig> are only derived from two individuals and genetic data are missing. therefore, further molecular genetic and bio-acoustic research based on a broader sampling is needed to draw final conclusions. of great interest are the acoustic data of the bornean taxa, in particular data of p.rubicunda. based on molecular genetic results p.melalophos is even polyphyletic since p.rubicunda is nested within the p.m.sumatrana, p.m.bicolor, p.m.melalophos/central sumatran p.m.mitrata clade  <cit> . previous studies already proposed a close affiliation of p.rubicunda and p.melalophos based on the red coat coloration  <cit>  or in some aspects of behavior and vocalization  <cit> . if species status of p.rubicunda is retained, species status of p.m.sumatrana, p.m.bicolor, p.m.melalophos will be consequently warranted, otherwise p.rubicunda has to be assigned as a subspecies of p.melalophos.

the correlation between acoustic structure and genetic differences was higher than the correlation between acoustic structure and geographic distance. this pattern can be explained by the following proposed presbytis migration pattern, which is largely in agreement with wilson and wilson  <cit> . the initial split in presbytis occurred between p.thomasi and all other taxa, and p.thomasi colonized north sumatra, which became isolated afterwards. the ancestor of the remaining taxa colonized first borneo and later sumatra. an early divergence of bornean taxa is also supported by previous genetic studies  <cit> . of the ancestral sumatran stock, one lineage invaded the mentawai islands , the other split into the proto-p.melalophos lineage and into the southern p.m.mitrata/p.comata lineage . although calls from p.femoralis/p.siamensis  are not analysed in our study, previous publications show similarities in call structures of p.femoralis and p.thomasi  <cit> . our genetic study  <cit>  shows that p.femoralis diverged relatively early from other lineages and, thus, the similar call structure of p.femoralis and p.thomasi might be a plesiomorphic feature. up to this point the genetic, geographic and acoustic differences between populations increased. from this point onwards the geographic distances between populations decreased, because proto-p.melalophos subsequently transmuted into various present day subspecies, which were finally distributed across sumatra as far as to the distribution range of p.thomasi in north sumatra. consequently, the geographic distance between p.thomasi and the remaining sumatran populations decreased, while the genetic and the acoustic differences increased. finally, the southern p.m.mitrata/p.comata lineage split into p.m.mitrata and p.comata that colonized java. in this case we have a linear migration pattern and thus would expect a similar high correlation between acoustic structure, genetic and geographic distance, as it was currently shown in crested gibbons which are proposed to migrate in a linear fashion from north to south  <cit> .

surilis and gibbons are limited to rainforest habitats where the selection pressure forces an optimal adaptation of the structure of loud-calls for transmission over longer distances  <cit> . since the structure of loud-calls is inherited and call adaptation forces a similar structure, gene flow could achieve the major influence on the structural variation of calls  <cit> . by combining the phylogenetic reconstruction of meyer and colleagues  <cit>  and the results of our study , we can observe a trend to simplification in call structure over time. however, it is difficult to explain why we found such a simplification in call structure. we cannot answer whether this is a general rule or whether this is a presbytis-specific trait. crested gibbons show an ambiguous result  <cit> , where after a long period of syllable types with simple frequency modulation, a trend to a slightly more complex modulation appears. more acoustic comparisons with more species and at a higher taxonomic level are necessary to answer this question.

interestingly, p.potenziani was regarded as most basal lineage  <cit>  and due to similarities in call structure, the species was proposed as closely affiliated with p.thomasi  <cit> . however, neither is the case, since p.potenziani derived much later  <cit> . the specific call structure of p.potenziani is therefore either the result of an analogous evolution or a pleisiomorphic presbytis feature. to clarify this issue further research is needed and particularly genetic and acoustic data on the bornean and malaysian taxa will help to better understand the evolution and phylogeography of the genus.

for instance, the call structure of p.rubicunda seems to be similar to p.melalophos calls  <cit>  and, as discussed above, molecular genetic data also group p.rubicunda with p.melalophos  <cit> . this close relationship can partly help to explain the interesting feature of general allopatry of respective presbytis taxa in sumatra, and sympatry in borneo  <cit> . p.rubicunda originated on sumatra and subsequently invaded borneo during the middle pleistocene via a proposed connection between both islands  <cit> . at this time borneo was already colonized by the bornean species p.chrysomelas, p.frontata and p.hosei. as a result of this second colonization, p.rubicunda is sympatric today with the three other species wherever their ranges overlap  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have shown that vocal similarity highly correlates with genetic relatedness; these two measures also correlate significantly with geographic distance, but the strength of the relationship is lower. accordingly, acoustic analysis of surili loud-calls has been proven to be a promising and powerful tool to support taxon-affiliation and phylogenetic relatedness. in addition, we were able to confirm the proposed paraphyly of p.melalophos by differences in loud-call structure. furthermore, acoustic analysis can be used as a tool to support proposed migration routes. these findings might also help to explain taxonomic relationships and migration backgrounds in other nonhuman primate taxa, as long as they have similar constraints in their vocal communication.
