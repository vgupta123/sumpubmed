BACKGROUND
robenacoxib is a novel and highly selective inhibitor of cox- <dig> in cats and dogs  <cit>  and is now available in several european countries for the treatment of articular pain and inflammation. robenacoxib is an acidic nsaid and is highly bound to plasma proteins with the result that it concentrates in inflamed tissues such as an arthritic joint  <cit> , thereby displaying the property of tissue selectivity  <cit> . the study described here was designed to show the effect of robenacoxib on the concentrations of blood and synovial fluid c-reactive protein , a recognized marker of inflammation. robenacoxib was selected for this study because it has this capacity for tissue selectivity. in addition to assessing the effect of robenacoxib on crp concentrations in blood and synovial fluid, its effect on lameness, radiographic changes and synovial fluid cytology in clinical cases of oa was investigated.

crp is one of several acute-phase proteins  that can be used to assess the innate immune system’s systemic response to infection, inflammation or trauma  <cit> . these proteins are traditionally measured in serum and by definition their concentration increases by more than 25% in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnfα which are released during the disease process. apps are highly sensitive indicators of inflammation but unfortunately lack specificity. apps are largely produced by the liver, although there is increasing evidence that other tissues can be a source  <cit> .

apps, particularly crp and serum amyloid a  have been widely studied in human rheumatology as biomarkers of arthritic disease  <cit>  and can be used to monitor response to therapy including nsaids  <cit> . serum levels of saa and crp have been shown to correlate with disease activity in different types of inflammatory arthritis  <cit> . buch et al.   <cit>  examined the value of crp as a predictor of response to therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. the authors found that reduction in crp levels following therapy was predictive of a clinical response within twelve to twenty-four weeks in over 50% of patients. measurement of crp is also a useful test in the diagnosis of infection after total knee arthroplasty  <cit>  and septic arthritis in children  <cit> . many studies have also examined concentrations of apps in synovial fluid as well as serum of patients with inflammatory joint disease. in most cases serum levels are found to be higher than synovial fluid levels  <cit>  although kumon and co-workers  <cit>  found that in some rheumatoid arthritis patients the synovial fluid levels of saa exceeded the serum concentrations.

increased concentrations of apps in plasma and synovial fluid of osteoarthritic patients has also been demonstrated in man, although at lower levels compared to the inflammatory arthropathies  <cit> . more sensitive assays such as the elisa are recommended for detecting the lower levels of apps that are found in osteoarthritis  <cit> . such assays have demonstrated modestly elevated blood levels of crp in human osteoarthritic patients compared to aged-matched controls  <cit>  and that increased levels of crp are associated with disease progression  <cit>  as well as with clinical severity  <cit> . it has also been reported that elevations in crp may reflect events that may precede but ultimately lead to radiographic progression in osteoarthritis  <cit> . in addition elevated crp has been found to be associated with the severity of pain in human oa  <cit>  and a relationship between elevated blood levels of crp, elevated synovial fluid levels of il- <dig> and the presence of chronic synovial inflammation as assessed histologically has been described  <cit> . pelletier et al.   <cit>  reported that higher baseline levels of serum crp in human patients are predictive of a greater risk of cartilage loss in oa and correlated with a worsening of symptoms including pain and function. crp was also found to be a good predictor of the symptomatic response to treatment using nsaids. however, kerkhof and colleagues   <cit>  reported that although human knee oa was associated with 14% higher serum crp levels, this association disappeared after adjustment for age and body mass index.

very few studies examining the usefulness of apps as biomarkers of canine arthritic disease have been published  <cit> . although there are differences within species as to which apps are most relevant to measure, crp is accepted as the most useful in the dog, a situation similar to man. caspi et al.  <cit>  reported that serum crp was found to be more elevated in dogs with active immune-based polyarthritis than in dogs with inactive disease or in affected dogs treated with corticosteroids, suggesting it might be a useful marker for the inflammatory arthropathies. hurter and co-workers  <cit>  examined the possible role of serum crp as a marker of disease in oa by measuring serum levels in  <dig> clinically affected dogs. in this study all the measured values were within the normal limits, although they had a tendency to be higher than the control group. the authors concluded that serum crp was not a useful clinical marker for canine oa. there have been no studies published on the measurement of crp in the synovial fluid of dogs although one study did measure saa levels in both serum and synovial fluid of dogs with inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint disease  <cit> . the numbers of dogs were too low to make any valid conclusions.

a recent collaborative study between the universities of glasgow and pisa suggested that synovial fluid levels of crp may be a useful marker of oa in the dog  <cit>  and provided the stimulus for the present study. we studied  <dig> dogs with hindleg lameness caused by failure of the cranial cruciate ligament and secondary osteoarthritis. blood and synovial fluid samples were collected when the dogs were presented and repeat samples were taken one month later after a course of robenacoxib and crp concentrations in the samples determined. the hypothesis was that treatment with the nsaid would significantly reduce the levels of synovial fluid crp thus demonstrating its usefulness as a biomarker of articular inflammation.

RESULTS
most of the dogs were of the heavier breeds and crossbreeds with a mean body weight of  <dig>  kg and a range of between 19– <dig> kg . the most common pure-breeds were the labrador retriever  and the golden retriever  although cross-breeds accounted for  <dig> % of the total. the mean age was  <dig>  years with a range of 1–12 years. the mean duration of lameness was  <dig>  weeks with a range between  <dig> -34 weeks. the mean body condition score was  <dig>   with a range of between  <dig>  and  <dig> . no adverse effects relating to the nsaid were reported. twenty-three of thirty-one dogs improved their lameness score after the course of robenacoxib; by one grade in  <dig> dogs and by two grades in  <dig> dogs. the score stayed the same in  <dig> dogs . there was a significant reduction in lameness score between pre-  and post-  treatment assessments . the radiographic score was unchanged in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs and was increased by one grade in  <dig> dogs and by two grades in  <dig> dogs . there was a significant difference between pre-  and post-  treatment radiographic scores . the synovial fluid score was the same in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs, had decreased by one grade in  <dig> cases and by two grades in  <dig> cases. the score had increased by one grade in  <dig> cases . there was not a statistically significant difference between pre-  and post-  treatment synovial fluid scores although a tendency for a decrease was observed .

serum crp concentration
the elisa to determine the concentration of crp in serum has been previously validated by kjelgaard-hansen and colleagues   <cit>  and was confirmed in our study  . fifteen of  <dig> dogs had a decreased concentration of crp and  <dig> cases an increase after treatment . there was no significant difference between pre-  and post-  treatment concentrations of serum crp.

synovial fluid crp concentration
validation of the elisa to measure crp in synovial fluid showed an intra-assay co-efficient of variance  of  <dig>  +/−  <dig> %  for duplicate samples . the precision profile based on the cvs of the duplicates  showed that higher cvs were given with low concentrations of crp in synovial fluid. inter-assay cvs were  <dig> % at a mean concentration of  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig> % at a mean concentration of  <dig>  mg/l . the accuracy of the assay in synovial fluid, determined by calculating the recovery of crp spiked into a pool of the fluid showed a recovery of 113%  and a correlation of r2 =  <dig>  for expected against observed concentrations. the assay had a limit of detection of  <dig>  mg/l, based on the concentration detectable at  <dig> standard deviations from the mean of the blank samples over  <dig> assays and allowing for the dilution of synovial fluid  used in the assay. the western blot  confirmed the presence of crp in synovial fluid with the double band known to be present in this species evident in both synovial fluid and serum samples.

nineteen of  <dig> cases had a lower concentration of crp in the post-treatment sample . seven cases had an increase. the post- treatment crp concentration in synovial fluid  was significantly lower compared to the pre-treatment level  .

the concentrations of crp in both the pre- and post-treatment synovial fluid samples were significantly greater than the levels  measured in normal synovial fluid samples .

there was no correlation between levels of crp in matched serum and synovial fluid samples, neither in the pre-treatment nor post-treatment samples.

discussion
a 28-day course of robenacoxib proved effective in reducing the lameness scores of dogs with stifle osteoarthritis secondary to failure of the cranial cruciate ligament. the reduction in lameness scores was statistically significant. it is accepted that a deficiency of the study was the use of a subjective assessment of lameness although all the lameness assessments were carried out by the same individual who was not aware of the initial score when re-evaluating the animal a month later. more objective measurements of lameness such as force plates and pressure mats were not available for this study. the use of activity monitors was not feasible since part of the case management involved restricted exercise during the course of the nsaid. the analgesic properties of nsaids for joint pain are well known and clinical improvement has been reported with many different compounds  <cit>  robenacoxib preferentially inhibits the cox- <dig> enzyme which is involved in the pathophysiology of joint pain and central sensitization  <cit> . it is possible that some of the clinical improvement was due to the restricted exercise regime used, although all of the dogs had already been placed on a controlled exercise plan by the referring veterinarian.

although in 58% of cases the radiographic scores did not change, overall there was a statistically significant increase in the radiographic score over the period of the study indicating that the radiographic changes had progressed. this is to be expected since once initiated, oa is a gradually progressive disease and there is little evidence that nsaids can influence the structural pathological changes that occur within the joint. the radiographic score that was used in this study is very much biased towards assessing osteophyte formation and changes in bone opacity and the only study which has shown an effect of a nsaid on such bony changes is an experimental study in the dog  <cit> . these studies involved only small numbers of dog and the protocol meant that the nsaid was given from day one when the arthritis was initiated , a situation very different from the clinical one, where the disease is generally well advanced before clinical signs are evident and treatment required.

the synovial fluid score based on total nucleated cell counts was not significantly affected by the course of robenacoxib. although it is generally accepted that the total nucleated cell count  does reflect the level of inflammation within the joint  <cit> , there have been no studies validating the use of nucleated cell counts as an outcome measure in the treatment of osteoarthritis.

a major finding in this study was the statistically significant decrease in the concentration of crp in synovial fluid following the month’s course of robenacoxib. there was no statistically significant difference in the concentration of serum crp between the pre- and post-treatment samples. this supports the view of hurter et al.  <cit>  who concluded that serum crp was not a useful marker of oa in the dog. our study is the first to have reported crp concentrations in the synovial fluid of dogs and the results support the possibility that synovial fluid crp is a useful biomarker of joint inflammation and a useful monitor of response to anti-inflammatory treatment. the concentrations of crp detected in the synovial fluid were much lower than the blood levels. although the concentrations of synovial fluid crp in the oa dogs were statistically significantly higher than found in normal synovial fluid, in approximately a third of cases the levels fell within the normal range even though they still decreased after therapy. the measurement of these relatively low levels of crp does require a very sensitive assay such as the elisa used in this study. immunoturbidimetric assays, used in previous reports  <cit>  had a limit of detection of 1 mg/l and are thus not sensitive enough to provide meaningful results, whereas the elisa used in our study had a lower limit of detection of  <dig>  mg/l. the assay was validated for use in measuring this protein in synovial fluid and demonstrated equivalent precision to that for serum crp while the accuracy of the assay was also acceptable with a recovery rate of 113% from spiked samples. whilst the antibody used in the western blot was not the same as used in the elisa, the immune blot does confirm that crp is present in canine synovial fluid.

it is possible that drugs used in inducing and maintaining general anaesthesia can cause alterations in the blood  concentration of crp in both humans  <cit>  and dogs  <cit>  although in all these studies the patients also underwent surgery and this is much more likely to be the stimulus for elevation of crp levels. in our study, both pre- and post-treatment blood samples were collected from conscious dogs but the  <dig> synovial fluid samples were collected whilst the dogs were anaesthetized, within minutes of the dog losing consciousness and before any surgical stimulus. the fact that both synovial fluid samples were collected under general anaesthesia means that comparison of crp concentrations in the pre-and post-treatment samples should not be compromised, even if the anaesthetic agents do have an effect since the same anaesthetic protocol was always used and any effect of the anaesthetic is likely to take several hours  <cit> .

the origin of synovial crp is not known. it could originate from the blood or be locally produced by the synovial membrane. there was no correlation between the concentrations of crp in synovial fluid and matched serum sample suggesting that levels in the synovial fluid were not merely a reflection of the serum levels. however, it is possible that crp in synovial fluid is solely a result of transfer from blood but that there is sufficient variation in the rate of transfer between dogs leading to the lack of correlation. alternatively, blood derived crp may be diluted to varying degrees by the synovial fluid. arthritic joints tend to have much greater volumes of synovial fluid than normal joints, which can vary between cases, although even in normal joints synovial fluid concentrations of crp tend to be lower than matched blood levels. local production of crp within the joint could also account for the lack of correlation of blood and synovial levels although to date, there have been no studies published to show local production of crp within the joint although this has been shown with saa in man  <cit> , dog  <cit>  and horse  <cit> . there have been several studies which have shown the local production of crp in other inflamed tissues proving that the liver is not the only source although it is probably the major producer, particularly when the patient is suffering from a systemic illness. a study by maekawa et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a significantly elevated gene expression of crp in human patients with gingivitis and periodontitis. the crp gene was up-regulated in fibroblasts and endothelial cells rather than the epithelial cells of the oral mucosae. another study demonstrated crp gene expression in adipose tissue from human patients  <cit> . adipose tissue is commonly found within the joint capsule and, in addition, the stifle joint contains the infra-patellar fat pad and this coupled with the fact that fibroblasts are the commonest cell found within the joint capsule means that it is highly likely that crp is produced locally within the joint. further studies, particularly determining crp gene expression within the synovium and looking for synovial isotypes of crp are required.

robenacoxib has been shown to persist within inflamed tissues for much longer than it remains in the circulation  <cit> . this has lead to the concept of tissue selectivity  <cit>  by which a drug concentrates in the inflamed tissues where it is required and has a prolonged anti-inflammatory effect. the fact that the half-life of the drug is reduced in the circulation means it is less likely to cause adverse effects on tissues such as the liver and kidney thus contributing to an improved safety profile. the fact that robenacoxib appears to reduce synovial levels of crp supports a local effect and the concept of tissue selectivity.

crp production is mediated by the catabolic cytokines, particularly il- <dig>  tnfα and il- <dig>  it is known that pge <dig> regulates the production of cytokines such is il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  macrophage colony stimulating factor and vascular endothelial growth factor  <cit> , possibly involving the activation of the pge <dig> receptors, ep <dig> and ep <dig> with an increase in cyclic amp. by inhibiting pge <dig> activity and thus cytokine production, nsaids will affect the acute phase response and also have other beneficial effects eg il- <dig> is known to stimulate pge <dig> production and matrix metalloproteinase production within the joint leading to articular cartilage damage, macrophage colony stimulating factor activates monocytes/macrophages to produce more catabolic cytokines and vascular endothelial growth factor plays an important role in angiogenesis and endothelial migration during the development of synovitis  <cit> . these effects would be additional benefits of using robenacoxib  in the treatment of osteoarthritis and help to explain why nsaids at the level of the joint may result in the slowing of disease progression  <cit> . we found no correlation between crp concentrations  and lameness or radiographical  scores.

it is worth noting that in dogs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> where the nsaid was stopped prematurely, there was a marked increase in the concentration of synovial fluid crp in the post-treatment sample . this was significantly greater than for any other case where there had been an increase after treatment; in all these other cases, the animal was still receiving the nsaid when the post-treatment sample was taken. this observation raises the question as to whether the nsaid should be gradually withdrawn after a therapeutic course rather than finished abruptly although further studies are necessary to investigate this.

CONCLUSIONS
robenacoxib proved to be safe and effective in reducing lameness scores  in dogs with failure of the cranial cruciate ligament and stifle oa. the drug did not significantly alter serum concentrations of crp but did significantly reduce synovial fluid concentrations , suggesting a local anti-inflammatory effect consistent with its property of being tissue selective. there was no correlation between matched serum and synovial fluid concentrations of crp, raising the possibility of a local production of crp within the joint, a possibility worthy of further investigation. crp concentration within synovial fluid is a potential biomarker of articular inflammation and may prove useful in monitoring ant-inflammatory responses to therapeutic agents. synovial fluid concentrations are much lower than those found in serum and their accurate measurement requires more sensitive assays  than routinely used for serum.
