BACKGROUND
intestinal diseases caused by clostridium difficile, mainly after antibiotic treatment, ranges from mild self-limiting diarrhoea to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis  and were until recently most commonly seen in hospitalized elderly patients  <cit> . however, the incidence of community-onset c. difficile infection has increased  <cit>  and c. difficile has also emerged as a pathogen or commensal in different animals such as pigs, calves and chickens  <cit> . studies on c. difficile in the environment are sparse and describe its presence in soil and water  <cit> . for both, environmental contamination and community-associated human infections, animals have been suggested as possible reservoir  <cit> .

the most prevalent pcr ribotypes differ between humans and food animals. in bovine and porcine hosts pcr ribotype  <dig>  is most often detected  <cit> . in humans approximately  <dig> pcr ribotypes are recognized and the most prevalent in many european countries is pcr ribotype 014/ <dig>   <cit> . however, in both animals and humans, the distribution of ribotypes is different between countries and from setting to setting, although the heterogeneity is much lower in animals compared to humans. two large pan-european studies have shown these geographic differences for human-associated c. difficile  <cit> . commonly identified pcr ribotypes for which only regional spreading is suggested are  <dig>  the predominant strain in the uk, ribotype  <dig> in austria and  <dig> which is predominant in italy  <cit> . in the united states and canada nap <dig>  corresponding to pcr ribotype  <dig> is one of the predominant strains in humans, and in japan and korea pcr ribotype 017/toxinotype viii  strain is responsible for cdi outbreaks  <cit> .

most of the comparative studies on c. difficile genotypes in humans and food animals have focused on ribotype  <dig> strain comparisons  <cit> . in addition to being the most frequently isolated strain from pigs and calves in north america and the netherlands  <cit>  it is becoming prevalent in humans in hospitals  <cit>  and in the community  <cit> . it is also often the most prevalent ribotype isolated from food  <cit> . some other currently important human ribotypes  are also reported from animals,  <cit>  but they seem to be less well established in animal hosts. there is currently no published report comparing a large number of strains isolated in the same geographic region from different sources, including humans, animals and the environment. this study makes such a comparison of c. difficile strains isolated from three of the possible main reservoirs in a single country to show that ribotypes other than  <dig> are shared between host types and the environment.

RESULTS
distribution of pcr ribotypes in different hosts and the environment
all  <dig> isolates that were isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> were grouped into  <dig> different pcr ribotypes; human isolates into  <dig> ribotypes, animal isolates into  <dig> ribotypes and the environmental isolates into  <dig> ribotypes . there was a considerable overlap between c. difficile ribotypes isolated from humans, animals and the environment. eleven pcr ribotypes were common to all three reservoirs. sixteen pcr ribotypes were shared only between humans and the environment and were not found in animals, and eight pcr ribotypes were common only to humans and animals. none of the pcr ribotypes identified was shared just between animals and the environment. these results agree in part with previous observations that most genotypes present in animals are also isolated from humans in the same region  <cit> . only a single study compared environmental and human c. difficile isolates and also noticed an overlap as  <dig> of  <dig> pcr ribotypes were shared between human and environmental strains  <cit> .

the distribution of the most common pcr ribotypes isolated from all three reservoirs in the time period from  <dig> to  <dig> is shown in table  <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> % of the environmental isolates were non-toxigenic compared to only  <dig> % of human and  <dig> % of animal isolates . when only toxigenic strains are compared, the two most prevalent pcr ribotypes shared between all three reservoirs were 014/ <dig> and  <dig> accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % ,  <dig> % and  <dig> % , and  <dig> % and  <dig> % , respectively. results for pcr ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are combined as these two ribotypes have very similar banding pattern which is sometime difficult to distinguish using classical agarose gel-based electrophoresis. ribotypes 014/ <dig> and  <dig> are also among the most prevalent ribotypes in europe  <cit> . this suggests that ability to survive in different environments plays a role in successful distribution and a high prevalence of a given genotype.

pcr ribotypes marked with* have been found in animals only not between years 2008- <dig>  Â§results for pcr ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are combined in this table since they have a very similar banding pattern which is sometime difficult to distinguish using classical agarose gel-based electrophoresis. ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are not among the most prevalent ribotypes and are added only for comparison.  - binary toxin positive

as already mentioned, most publications dealing with comparisons of animal and human strains focus on porcine ribotype  <dig> strains and suggest that pig farms can be an important emerging source of human infection or colonization  <cit> . our previous studies have shown that ribotype  <dig> can be completely absent in animals in a given country and that ribotypes other than pcr ribotype  <dig>  are prevalent in pigs and other farm animals in slovenia  <cit> . pcr ribotype  <dig>  has been found only in humans in slovenia; of six isolates identified, five came from stool specimens and one from an infected wound. pcr ribotype  <dig>  has been found in humans  and rivers .

current epidemic strain, pcr ribotype 027/toxinotypeiii/nap <dig> was reported in domestic animals and their environment mostly in canadian studies  <cit> . our collection did not include any animal  <dig> strain. first human pcr ribotype  <dig> strain was identified only in  <dig> and this type accounted for as little as  <dig> %  of all human isolates .

characterisation of most common pcr ribotypes found in animals and humans
due to the large number of isolates available  only a subset of representative strains from the most common pcr ribotypes found in humans and animals were further characterized with pfge and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. selected strains belonged to  <dig> different pcr ribotypes: 014/020/, 010/, slo 055/, 023/, 029/, 002/ and 150/. a single strain of pcr ribotype slo  <dig> was included in the comparison as its pcr ribotyping profile is very similar to the profile of pcr ribotype  <dig> 

the majority of strains of a single pcr ribotype isolated from humans and animals grouped together with pfge regardless of which restriction enzyme was used . with smai groups were more coherent and in four toxigenic pcr ribotypes , human and animal isolates had indistinguishable banding pattern . however, when restriction was performed with sacii, only one pig isolate had an identical banding pattern to the human one while other animal isolates differed from human isolates of the same ribotype but still belonged to the same pulsotype . within non-toxigenic group of strains  a human isolate of pcr ribotype slo  <dig>  had an identical banding pattern when restriction was performed with smai, though with sacii the human and the two animal isolates belonged to different pulsotypes. these results are in agreement with previous studies reporting human and food animal strains to be very closely related or indistinguishable using different typing methods. in the usa toxinotype v strains  isolated from humans and pigs have been found to be indistinguishable with pfge  <cit> . in more recent study by koene et al. , comparing human and animal isolates from the same geographic location and time period with the mlva, authors confirmed previously observed relatedness between human and porcine ribotype  <dig> strains but in contrast to our pfge results  no genetic relatedness could be observed for human and animal isolates of ribotype  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

a great focus has been given on pigs as a source of human cdi. poultry which can harbour a variety of human associated pcr ribotypes has been so far overlooked  <cit> . two human and one poultry isolate of ribotype  <dig>  had indistinguishable banding pattern with smai and belonged to the same pulsotype with sacii . for companion animals  has also been shown to harbour the same ribotypes as humans  <cit> . in our study, one dog and one cat isolate of pcr ribotype 014/ <dig> had identical banding pattern as the human isolates of the same pcr ribotype using smai restriction enzyme and belonged to the same pulsotype when sacii restriction patterns were compared .

the genetic relatedness of human and animal isolates shown in this study suggests that not only ribotype  <dig> strains show zoonotic potential. other ribotypes are shared between animals and humans as well, and that alongside porcine and cattle, poultry can also be an important link for human cdi. whether and how often the transmission from animals to humans and/or vice versa occurs have yet to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
ribotype  <dig> is not the only ribotype significantly shared between humans and animals. here we show that all genotypes that are among most prevalent in  humans have a tendency to prevail also in animals and in the environment  and that a better environmental survival might be part of their virulence spectrum. human and animal isolates of the same pcr ribotype clustered together with pfge and had mostly also similar mic values for all antibiotics tested. this genetic relatedness suggests that transmission of given genotype from one reservoir to the other is likely to occur.

materials and methods
c. difficile isolates
isolates included in the comparison originated from humans, animals and the non-hospital environment and are part of the strain collection at the institute of public health maribor. altogether  <dig> isolates from slovenia were available. isolates from all three reservoirs were sampled from the overlapping geographical locations and time periods.

human isolates  were recovered by routine diagnostic laboratories throughout slovenia and submitted to our laboratory for typing between  <dig> and  <dig>  the isolates were from hospitalized patients and from patient from other institutions , and were not submitted as a part of an outbreak investigation.

environmental isolates were from river water  and soil , and were isolated between  <dig> and  <dig>  river water isolates from  <dig> rivers throughout slovenia were collected as a part of the national surveillance of surface waters. soil isolates originated from the field near the poultry farm from which poultry samples were collected. the isolates were cultured as described elsewhere  <cit> .

animal isolates  were from piglets , calves , a horse , poultry and birds , and dogs and cats  isolated between  <dig> and  <dig>  piglet isolates  were from  <dig> pig farms located in different parts of slovenia. poultry isolates were from two big facility for laying hens and three smaller farms. dog, cat and calf isolates were from different slovenian households and farms. stool samples or rectal swabs collected from these animals were processed as described elsewhere  <cit> . due to the clustering , only  <dig> animal isolates , poultry and birds , dogs and cats , calves  and a horse) were included in the final analysis .

the final number of isolates included in the comparison of prevalence and distribution of pcr ribotypes was  <dig>  from the time period 2008- <dig>  as for this time period environmental strains were available. for the pfge and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of human and animal strains,  <dig> isolates from broader time interval  were selected.

molecular characterisation
all isolates were characterised by toxinotyping and pcr ribotyping. toxinotyping involved amplification and subsequent restriction of pcr fragment a <dig>  and b <dig> . paloc negative strains were confirmed by amplification of a  <dig> bp-long insert with primers lok1/lok <dig>  <cit> . the binary toxin gene  was detected as described previously  <cit> .

pcr ribotyping was performed with the primers 16s  and 23s  as described by bidet et al.   <cit> . after amplification pcr products were concentrated to a final volume of  <dig> Î¼l by heating at 75Â°c for  <dig> min before electrophoresis in 3% agarose gel  in 1Ã tae buffer for  <dig> h at  <dig>  v/cm. bionumerics software  version  <dig>  was used to analyze the banding patterns. pcr ribotypes for which reference strains were available were designated by standard cardiff nomenclature  while others were designated by internal nomenclature .

a total of  <dig> c. difficile isolates of the most prevalent pcr ribotypes found in humans and animals isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> were further analyzed with pfge and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. selection of the strains was made by randomly selecting human and animal strains isolated in the same time period and from the same geographic locations covering different slovenian regions. these included  <dig> human isolates and  <dig> animal isolates from pigs , poultry , a cat , calves  and dogs .

pulsed field gel electrophoresis
pfge was performed as described elsewhere  <cit> . genomic dna was digested with  <dig> u of sacii or smai  overnight and biometra pfge system  was used for electrophoresis. dendrograms were constructed using bionumerics software  <dig>   by the upgma clustering method, using the dice coefficient with position tolerance and optimization of  <dig> %. clusters with â¥ 80%  or â¥ 85%  similarity were considered to be distinct pulsotypes.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing
the same strains typed by pfge were also tested for antibiotic resistance. minimum inhibitory concentrations  of  <dig> antimicrobial agents; rifampicin , moxifloxacin , erythromycin , piperacilin/tazobactam , tetracycline  and clindamycin cli), were determined by the e-test method. an inoculum of mcfarland  <dig>  was swabbed on brucella blood agar supplemented with haemin  and vitamin k <dig> . plates were incubated for  <dig> h at 37Â°c in an anaerobic atmosphere. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron atcc  <dig> was used as a quality control strain. resistance was defined according the following breakpoints established by the clsi guidelines: clindamycin  â¥  <dig> mg/l, tetracycline  â¥  <dig> mg/l, piperacillin/tazobactam  â¥  <dig> mg/l, moxifloxacin  â¥  <dig> mg/l, erythromycin  â¥  <dig> mg/l and rifampicin  â¥  <dig> mg/l  <cit> . mic <dig> and mic <dig> were calculated for human and animal isolates. the frequencies at which the mics for human isolates were above the mic <dig> and mic <dig> values for all isolates tested were compared with fisher's exact t test.
