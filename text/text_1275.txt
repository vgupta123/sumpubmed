BACKGROUND
the outer membrane of mitochondria and chloroplasts as well as gram-negative bacteria, their evolutionary cousins, harbor proteins of β-barrel structure, known as β-barrel outer membrane proteins . the current version of the endosymbiotic theory of mitochondria origin  <cit>  suggests that mitochondria descend from an α-proteobacteria, possibly similar to rickettsiales, an order of intracellular parasites  <cit> . bomps are predicted to occupy about 3% of the proteomes of rickettsiales  <cit> . thus, unless rickettsiales has gained many mbomps since its divergence from mitochondria, the α-proteobacteria ancestor of mitochondria might be expected to have possessed about  <dig> bomps. currently four families of mitochodrial bomps  have been identified: tom <dig>  sam <dig> , vdac and mdm <dig>  <cit> . these mbomps perform important functions in mitochondria. tom <dig> is required for the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins into mitochondria, as it forms the import pore of the translocase of the outer membrane  complex  <cit> . sam <dig> is the central component of the sorting and assembly machinery  complex and promotes the integration of proteins into the outer membrane  <cit> . notably, only sam <dig> shows clear sequence homology with non-mitochondrial proteins: omp <dig> in bacterial and toc75-v in chloroplasts  <cit> . both tom <dig> and sam <dig> are essential for yeast cell viability  <cit> . the vdac family serves as the diffusion pore for small molecules entering or leaving the mitochondria  <cit> . vdac is also thought to contribute to membrane permeability in mitochondrial induced apoptosis  <cit>  and is promising as a drug target because of its permeability  <cit> . in yeast, mdm <dig> is required for mitochondrial morphology and dynamics  <cit> . homologs of mdm <dig> have not been reported in mammals. mdm <dig> is reported to be part of the sam complex and have a role in the biogenesis of mbomps  <cit> . recent studies have shown that mdm <dig> are members of the er-mitochondria tethering complex  <cit> .

based on experimental evidence  <cit> , yeast mmm <dig> , was once considered to be an mbomp, and in our previous work  <cit>  we treated it as such. however, recently pairwise hidden markov model  comparison has revealed that the smp domain found in the n-terminal region of mmm <dig>  belongs to the tulip superfamily of lipid/hydrophobic ligand-binding domains containing members with known  structure  <cit> .

as reviewed in  <cit> , precursors of mbomps are synthesized in the cytosol without a classical n-terminal matrix targeting signal  or other known targeting signals, but are nonetheless imported across the outer membrane by the tom complex. in the inter-membrane space, small tim proteins then escort them to the sam complex which inserts and assembles them. in spite of significant progress towards the identification of the components involved in the biogenesis of mbomps, the import and insertion signal of mbomps are still not clear. the first tertiary structure of an mbomp, human vdac- <dig>  was recently solved  <cit> . interestingly, vdac- <dig> consists of  <dig> transmembrane β-strands, unlike all known bacterial bomp  structures, which have even number of β-strands . there is some sequence similarity between the vdac family and tom <dig> families. the structure of the c-terminal part of tom <dig> is thought to be similar to vdac- <dig>  <cit> . the number of mbomp families is not known. many bomps have been identified in bacteria, but ony four families have been found to date in mitochondria. of course, some mbomp families may remain undiscovered, but it is difficult to experimentally screen for mbomps, even in model organisms. zahedi et al.  <cit>  report a proteomics study of the mitochondrial outer membrane in yeast which detected  <dig> proteins, including both mbomps and α-helical proteins. burri et al.  <cit>  found that  <dig> proteins precipitate out of a fraction expected to contain mbomps and lipid-modified proteins. neither of these results are specific to mbomps.

searching for new mbomps by computational analysis has been difficult as well, due to the extreme divergence in sequence and structure between mbomps and their bacterial homologs . recent bioinformatic developments include an analysis using a homology detection method based on transitive sequence similarity search, in which similarity was measured by pairwise hmm profile comparison  <cit> . in that study the authors identified sam <dig>  vdac and tom <dig> as bbomp homologs, but found no promising novel mbomps in the yeast or human proteome.

however, recent experimental studies have provided useful information to search for novel mbomps by sequence analysis: the discovery of the β-signal  <cit> , a c-terminal motif, which is proposed to be the insertion signal of mbomps into the outer membrane; the determination of the first tertiary structure of vdac- <dig>  <cit> ; and the import analysis of bbomps in yeast  <cit> . in particular, the identification of the β-signal gave us the opportunity to search for novel candidates of mbomps by bioinformatics analysis. in preliminary work  <cit> , we used the presence of a conserved β-signal in mitochondrial proteins to search for new candidate mbomps and came to the conclusion that probably very few mbomps remain undiscovered.

however, for several reasons, our preliminary study could not be considered conclusive: 1) we limited our search to proteins annotated by uniprot  <cit>  or gene ontology  <cit>  as having possible mitochondria localization - but uncharacterized proteins might lack that annotation and 2) we limited the search for β-signals to the c-terminal  <dig> residues - but mbomps having an internal β-signal might exist. moreover, recent experiments expressing bbomps in yeast  <cit> , and results we report here on presumed homologs of known mbomps, call into question the necessity of the β-signal for all mbomps.

in this paper, we describe an expanded search which addresses those limitations. for this search we developed a new machine learning based predictor, trained on both bacterial and mitochondrial proteins, for the prediction of β-barrel membrane proteins based on sequence features designed to reflect structural constraints and specific sorting signals that mbomps are expected to lack. we report the results of a comprehensive search of known eukaryotic protein sequences employing our new predictor, conserved c-terminal or internal β-signals, secondary structure prediction, and literature search. we also use our new predictor to conduct a β-signal independent search against the yeast and arabidopsis proteomes. we found no new candidates in yeast, while in arabidopsis several uncharacterized proteins met the search criteria, and one seems potentially promising.

we conclude that there probably are no new mbomps to be found in yeast and maybe very few mbomps remaining to be found at all, although we must admit that if β-signal independent or multimeric mbomps exist, our search might miss them.

since mbomps are at the core of all known mitochondria outer membrane channels, our results suggest the possibility that the interface between the mitochondria and the cytosol is largely realized by a handful of protein families.

RESULTS
conservation of β-signal
kutik et al.  <cit>  proposed the "β-signal", with the motif poxgxxhyxhy  occurring near the end of the most c-terminal β-strand. figure  <dig> shows the sequence logo  <cit>  of  <dig> and  <dig> unique β-signal motif sequences; obtained from multiple sequence alignments of  <dig> mbomp homologs with confirmed expression, and  <dig> mbomps including proteins whose existence is only inferred by homology, respectively.

β-signal position
for each known mbomp family , a well conserved β-signal motif match occurs near the c-terminus around or near the final known or predicted β-strand .

β-signal consensus
the increase of available protein sequences since our preliminary study  <cit> , allowed us to refine the β-signal motif somewhat. as indicated in table  <dig> which shows the frequency of amino acid groups in the β-signal motif match of  <dig> putative mbomp homolog sequences, the first residue of the β-signal motif is usually polar, but no negatively charged residues are observed. the residue following glycine  is almost always hydrophobic. thus we proposed  <cit>   a slightly refined motif pattern: poxghyxhyxhy . as can be seen in table  <dig> and the sequence logos of figure  <dig>  the second position is nearly always a hydrophobic residue. thus pohyghyxhyxhy could also be considered as an alternative consensus sequence. moreover the other "x" positions also clearly show non-random residue preferences, for example, smaller residues such as glycine, serine, alanine are abundant, however the commonly observed residues do not all share similar properties in terms of hydrophobicity; and because the sequences used are not all mutually independent, the column heights in their sequence logo do not necessarily indicate statistical significance .

large hydrophobic
small hydrophobic
non-negatively charged polar
negatively charged
the numbers in parentheses are frequencies of each amino acid group in each position of the β-signal in  <dig> mbomp sequences. "background" is the overall frequency of each amino acid group in the entire set of sequences.

in any case, the β-signal region of mbomps, for the most part including the "x" positions as well, has a dyad periodicity of hydrophobic residues, and is devoid of the secondary structure breaker proline; as would be expected for a β-strand in which one side faces the membrane and the other an aqueous pore  <cit> . this is consistent with the original proposal of kutik et al.  <cit>  and the recently determined micelle structure of vdac  <cit> , in which the β-signal occurs in the final β-strand.

β-signal motif match occurrence frequency
the β-signal was proposed as a signal found near the end of the barrel region, and known mbomps generally have β-signal motif matches near their c-terminal. however, except for the possibly invariant glycine, the β-signal allows for much variation. moreover, the β-signal motif is consistent with the general pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues expected from any membrane barrel β-strand. the lack of proline residues is also expected from secondary structure. thus one may wonder if matches to the β-signal motif would be expected to occur by chance in most barrel strands. to investigate this we assumed a statistical null model, in which the frequency of β-signal matches is the same in the length  <dig> c-terminal region as it is in a randomly chosen length  <dig> region not overlapping with the length  <dig> c-terminal region. a drawback of this model is that ideally we should exclude the non-barrel portion of mbomp from consideration but we did not do this. however, the structure of vdac  <cit>  suggests that most of its sequence, at least, is part of its β-barrel.

in any case, we computed the probability of this null model for vdac, tom <dig>  sam <dig> and mdm <dig> , using ten versions of the β-signal motif. the most significantly enriched pattern for sam <dig> is pohyghyhy¯ hyxhy, where hy¯ denotes any residue except . the β-signal of each of  <dig> sam <dig> homologs matches this pattern, but no other matches are found within those sequence. for vdac pohyghyxhyxhy and pohyghyhy¯ hyxhy; for tom <dig>  poxghyxhyxhy; and for mdm <dig>  hy¯hyghyxhyxhy and hy¯hyghyhy¯xhy are the most enriched. interestingly, for each of the four mbomp families, the β-signal motif is still enriched even if the glycine is ignored. before seeing this result, we were inclined to view the glycine as the heart of the β-signal and the other positions to perhaps simply reflecting secondary structure. however, patterns such as pohyxhyhy¯hyxhy, skipping the requirement for glycine in the third position, still attain p-values around 10- <dig> or less; suggesting that the other positions may also contribute in a specific way to the recognition of the β-signal.

statistics on the frequency of matches in the c-terminal versus non-c-terminal part of mbomps families is shown for the  <dig> known mbomps and  <dig> variations of the β-signal motif. each cell holds a triple: the fraction of homologs with c-termini which match the motif, the fraction of non-c-terminal length  <dig> substrings of the mbomp sequences which match the motif, and a p-value. the p-value is computed with a binomial test, in which the non-c-terminal frequency  is the probability of success and the c-terminal frequency  is the observed data.

although these results are suggestive, we must warn the reader to interpret the p-values with caution. as mentioned above, one problem is the fact that some non-barrel regions are included in non-c-terminal statistics. perhaps a more serious flaw is that our logic is somewhat circular, because the β-signal motif was partially derived from multiple sequence alignment of the c-terminal region of some of these mbomp homologs . finally the homolog sequences are not mutually independent , but the p-value computation assumes independence.

conserved β-signal based mbomp search
our search started with  <dig> , <dig> eukaryotic protein sequences from uniprot version  <dig> . we applied a simple filter to remove nearly identical sequences, clustered with blastclust at 40% identity and removed singleton clusters to obtain  <dig>  homolog clusters. figure  <dig> shows our search pipeline  and the number of candidates surviving each filter.  <dig> and  <dig> protein sequence clusters survived all steps of the c-terminal  and internal β-signal  search respectively.

u, g and i in "subcellular localization" and "family and domain" represent the source of annotation from uniprot, gene ontology and interpro, respectively

exceptions to the β-signal consensus motif
as detailed above, we believe the two protein sequence clusters which passed the internal β-signal path of our search pipeline are homologs of known mbomps. however it is not clear that they really have internal β-signals. the β-signal motif matches of q7re <dig> and q4cq <dig> are not found in their final predicted β-strand . the proteins q7re <dig>  q4cq <dig> and q293i <dig>  have conserved β-signal motif matches near their fifth, fourth and second predicted β-strands from their c-terminals, respectively. focusing on the final predicted β-strand of these three proteins; q4cq <dig> and q293i <dig> have partial β-signal motif matches such as kfgltwss and afgmrfvv, while q7re <dig> has a match kfgfmmhi but one protein in its cluster, a putative tom <dig> of plasmodium berghei , only matches  when a gap is inserted after glycine .

upon examining clusters which did not pass our conserved β-signal based search, we found some included homologs to known mbomps that do not possess perfect matches to the β-signal motif. namely, the tom <dig> homolog  <dig> of arabidopsis thaliana, tom <dig> of chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and a putative sam <dig> homolog of cryptococcus neoformans . in that figure we also show the n-terminal regions of the bbomps: phoe, ompa  and omp <dig>  reported by walther et al.  <cit>  to be "correctly" integrated into the mitochondrial outer membrane when expressed in yeast. as those authors point out, phoe and omp <dig> do not have an appropriate match to the β-signal motif .

moreover, in our analysis of  <dig> putative known mbomp homologs, we found that  <dig> did not match the β-signal motif. for example, the neurospora crassa vdac sequence has threonine in the 4th position following the glycine and the putative schizosaccharomyces pombe and schizosaccharomyces japonicus mdm <dig> β-signal sequences are ffgvhfey and ffgihfqy, with a phenylalanine instead of a polar residue in the first position . in uniprot, the protein existence field of  <dig> of those is listed as "inferred by homology", but two exceptions are verified proteins: vdac of n.crassa and mdm <dig> of s.pombe.

β-signal independent yeast mbomp search
despite allowing the possibility of internal β-signals, our conserved β-signal based search for mbomps failed to yield any promising new candidates. to make our search as comprehensive as possible, we also considered the possibility that some mbomps have no β-signal at all.

we searched the yeast proteome  for mbomps lacking β-signals by combining our new β-signal independent mbomp prediction method combined with psipred  <cit>  secondary structure prediction and annotation based manual inspection. the features used by our new mbomp predictor are: three types of amino acid composition; physicochemical features of the n-terminal sorting region, two amphiphilicity scores based on periodicity and position weight matrices of bacterial transmembrane β-strands and 2-strand β-hairpins . only a single sequence, that of the uncharacterized protein "yjl217w", passed our β-signal independent search against the yeast proteome.

comparison to proteomics studies in yeast
as mentioned in the background section, two experimental studies have tried to identify outer membrane proteins in yeast.

zahedi et al.  <cit>  report a proteomics study of the mitochondrial outer membrane in yeast which detected  <dig> proteins including all known mbomps. however their method cannot distinguish between mbomps, outer membrane α-helical proteins  and some peripheral membrane proteins. we find only  <dig> proteins in yeast  instead of  <dig>  but this may be explained by the non-mbomp proteins included in their list. in another experiment on yeast by burri et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> proteins precipitated out of a triton x- <dig> detergent phase expected to contain mbomp or lipid-modified proteins. two were determined to be the mbomps vdac- <dig> and tom <dig>  and one, which the authors speculate may be lipid-modified, contained peptides derived by xdj <dig>  the only information given for the remaining eight is their molecular masses, which are different than known yeast mbomps. without knowing the identity of these proteins we cannot give a specific analysis. one possibility is that those eight proteins are lipid-modified but not mbomps.

is yjl217w an mbomp?
secondary structure prediction shows yjl217w is an all β-protein with a match to the β-signal motif around the most c-terminal predicted β-strand ).  yjl217w has no known eukaryotic homologs. according to annotations of interpro, yjl217w belongs to the duf <dig> family along with several hypothetical bacterial proteins based on sequence similarity; but the function of this family is unknown. yjl217w has no predicted signal peptide or matrix targeting signal, which is consistent with being an mbomp. however, recently the structure of yjl217w was solved ). according to this structure, yjl217w is not a β-barrel, but instead forms a β-sandwich structure like concanavalin. additionally, yjl217w was not identified as an mitochondrial outer membrane protein in the proteomics study of zahedi et al.  <cit> , and was found to have a cytosolic localization in a global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast  <cit> . thus we do not think yjl217w is an mbomp.

β-signal independent arabidopsis search
yeast have relatively small proteomes and are evolutionarily very distant from plants and animals. this limits the scope of what we can conclude from the yeast β-signal independent search. ideally we would like to perform a β-signal independent search on all eukaryotic proteins, but unfortunately our pipeline partially depends on manual inspection of annotation and ad hoc analysis, so such a search would be infeasible in terms of both the amount of work entailed and the lack of experimental annotation for most species.

as a compromise, we chose to perform a β-signal independent search on the well annotated plant arabidopsis. plants contain mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which are thought to descend from gram negative bacteria and are known to have bomps in their outer membranes. our mbomp predictor was not trained on any chloroplastic bomps , but to the extent that cbomps are similar to other bomps, we might expect our classifier to be able to detect them.

several cbomps have been identified so far  of toc <dig>  oep <dig>  oep <dig> and oep21)  <cit> . for arabidopsis, uniprot lists three isoforms of toc <dig> , oep <dig>  oep <dig> and oep <dig> and four mbomps were annotated . we applied our β-signal independent pipeline to the arabidopsis proteome . as in the yeast proteome analysis, we used our β-signal independent mbomp prediction method combined with secondary structure prediction, α-helical membrane protein and signal peptide prediction, and finally manual inspection of annotations to find novel mbomp  candidates.  <dig> proteins passed the automated steps of our pipeline, but we rejected  <dig> of these based on domain and other annotation .  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> proteins are annotated bomps,  <dig> mbomps  and  <dig> cbomps . another five proteins contain the eukaryotic porin domain and four contain the bacterial surface antigen  domain. this indicates that these proteins probably belong to the vdac, tom <dig>  or the sam50/omp <dig> families, respectively. most of the remaining  <dig> proteins have no annotation of functional domain or family. we attempted to gain some information by presenting these sequences to the bomp predictor hhomp  <cit> , and the sequence structure similarity detectors hhpred  <cit>  and forte  <cit> . these predictors suggested that one of the proteins, q9sxb7:at1g <dig>  has partial similarity to proteins with β-barrel structure. however no such similarity was detected for the remaining  <dig> proteins. only one of these proteins, q9m <dig>  posesses an appropriately placed match to the β-signal, tlgyaflv .

in summary we found  <dig> known or probable mbomps from known mbomp families,  <dig> known cbomps, one promising bomp candidate and  <dig> unannotated candidates which are either false positives or distant enough from known bomps that they elude state of the art sequence-sequence and sequence-structure similarity detectors. currently we cannot rule out either possibility. interestingly, one of these  <dig> has a β-signal match, suggesting the possibility that it may be an mbomp.

our results differ significantly from an earlier in silico study performed by schleiff et al.  <cit> , in which  <dig> candidate cbomp proteins were identified. the schleiff et al. pipeline used a bomp predictor developed by wimley  <cit>  and differs from ours in other ways as well, but the overall scheme is very similar. yet the number of candidate cbomp proteins differs by an order magnitude. clearly both estimates cannot be  correct, so this discrepency should be explained if possible.

although we are unable to give a definitive argument in favor of our estimate, we point out one important difference between these two studies. schleiff et al.  <cit>  used known cbomps to tune their pipeline; they lowered the threshold of their β-barrel predictor score from the value of  <dig>  recommended by wimley based on bacterial bomps to  <dig> , and made other major adjustments in order to include known cbomps. in contrast, our study was originally completely focused on mitochondria and thus all the programs and parameters in our pipeline were chosen without considering information about known cbomps.

despite this fact our pipeline detects  <dig> out of  <dig> known cbomp proteins, which suggests that our results are not overly conservative. however our pipeline did miss two identified cbomps  and thus may very well have missed some as yet unidentified cbomps.

is at1g <dig> an novel arabidopsis bomp?
q9sxb7:at1g <dig> has  <dig> residues. the c-terminal  <dig> residue segment  was predicted by our predictor to include a β-barrel. hhomp detected cyanobacterial somb as a at1g <dig> homolog , and hhpred and forte both judged at1g <dig> to be similar to bacterial β-barrels. hhpred judged the 159- <dig>  91- <dig> and 322- <dig> segments to be similar to the 282- <dig> segment of p. putida toluene transporter todx , to 13- <dig> of e. coli ompa  and to 141- <dig> of n. meningitides opca , respectively. while forte identified similarities between the 134- <dig> segment of at1g <dig> and the 378- <dig> segment of s. marcescens hasr .

the interpretation of these results is not completely clear, as the predictions involve a patchwork of different bacterial β-barrel structures. however, they do suggest the possibility that at1g <dig> is a bomp. it could be either a cbomp or an mbomp. the fact that chloroplasts are believed to descend from cyanobacteria and hhomp assigns a high homology probability to a cyanobacterial bomp, favors the possibility that it is a cbomp. we also examined the c-terminal region for a β-signal match. it does have a match, sdgrtigl, to the originally proposed consensus of poxgxxhyxhy, overlapping the last predicted β-strand. however, both of the two residues neighboring glycine are hydrophilic and seldom if ever observed in β-signals , so most likely this is not a genuine β-signal.

search for novel mbomps
our comprehensive search based on the β-signal only detected mbomps from known mbomp families. we also conducted β-signal independent searches on the yeast and arabidopsis proteomes; yielding no new candidates for yeast, but a few for arabidopsis, one of which seems promising. however it is not yet clear whether this candidate really is an mbomp.

recently remmert et al.  <cit>  performed a bioinformatic proteome analysis using a transitive sequence profile similarity based homology detection method, but only detected four known  and no undiscovered mbomps in yeast. subsequently, these authors showed evidence that all outer membrane barrels from gram-negative bacteria form a monophyletic group that descended from a single ββ-hairpin and suggest this probably is true of mbomps as well  <cit> . their work supports our hypothesis and complements the search we report here. their work should be very sensitive at detecting homologs, while our novel mbomp predictor has the potential to detect analogs or distant homologs with no detectable sequence signal remaining.

however it is important to consider what kind of hypothetical mbomps could elude our search. although not designed for cbomp detection, when we applied our pipeline  to arabidopsis it detected most known cbomps - but missed two. one of these, toc75-iii, has an n-terminal bipartite transit peptide which is cleaved during biogenesis  <cit> . of all known eukaryotic bomps, toc75-iii is the only one with a cleavable targeting signal. if such mbomps also exist, our search would probably miss them.

our search might miss multimeric mbomps. several bbomps are known to form a β-barrel structure from multiple protein chains. for example tolc forms a  <dig> strand β-barrel structure from three tolc molecules, each contributing  <dig> β-strands  <cit> . unfortunately tolc, and other multimeric bomps, possess large soluble domains in addition to their β-barrels, and since each sequence only contains a fraction of the β-barrels, the overall fraction of β-strand secondary structure is quite small. our prediction method attempts to account for β-barrels with soluble domains through the use of segmentation. however this is not sufficient to detect proteins like tolc, for which the β-barrel sequence region is very short. currently it is not known if any multimeric mbomps exist, but if they do we must admit that our pipeline would probably miss them.

although the currently accepted known mbomps all use the β-signal for membrane integration, mbomps using other mechanisms may exist. if they do, our pipeline would probably miss them. we only applied the β-signal independent version of our search on two model organisms. ideally we would like to apply it to all eukaryotic proteins, but unfortunately that would result in a list of hundreds or thousands of candidate proteins, without much annotation or additional information to cull or prioritize the list. even when applied to arabidopsis, our β-signal independent produced  <dig> candidate bomp proteins, for which we can not find corroborating evidence to support or refute. from our results, we can conclude that in the yeast proteome, it is unlikely that we missed any novel undiscovered mbomp simply because they lack β-signals, but rather they would have to differ more dramatically from known mbomps. unfortunately we can make no strong conclusions regarding the possibility of β-signal independent mbomps in other species.

last, but not least, our search would definitely miss any new mbomps which only occur in singleton clusters when clustered at 40% identity. unfortunately this limitation cannot currently be avoided. as can be seen by the β-signal independent aradopsis search, which yielded at least  <dig> but perhaps as many as  <dig> false positives, our method depends on an effective β-signal filter to have enough discriminative power to be applied on a eukaryote-wide scale. unfortunately the β-signal is an information poor motif and occurs quite frequently in non-mbomp proteins. so the only way to make the β-signal filter effectively reduce false positives is to require evidence of conservation, and thus we were forced to discard singleton clusters. it is difficult to "prove a negative" and it will always be possible to suggest that an informatics search of the type performed here may miss mbomps due to incomplete data or incorrect assumptions. however we believe the search describe here, in conjunction with the consistent results of remmert et al.  <cit>  obtained with a different methodology, offer strong enough evidence to place the burden of proof on anyone who advocates the existence of undiscovered mbomp families. two potential avenues to pursue this are refined proteomics techniques which can distinguish between bomp and other outer membrane proteins, and sequence analysis of novel organisms not yet included in uniprot.

uth <dig> not an mbomp?
we mentioned yeast uth <dig> as the only candidate mbomp identified in our preliminary work  <cit> . however, further analysis suggests that uth <dig> is probably not an mbomp. uth <dig> has a β-signal motif match near its last predicted β-strand, however our new β-signal independent mbomp predictor does not predict it to be an mbomp.

uth <dig> was reported to have an outer membrane localization  <cit> , but the authors did not specifically claim that it is a β-barrel. another study failed to confirm its mitochondrial localization, "preliminary yeast cell fractionation analyses showed that uth <dig> with an epitope tag was not efficiently recovered with mitochondria, suggesting that it is not a mitochondrial protein" . thus, we conclude that uth <dig> probably is not an mbomp.

β-signal
our mbomp homolog analysis confirms and slightly refines the β-signal. as can be inferred from the statistics in table  <dig> and 2; in mdm <dig> the first position is not always polar, but glycine and other small residues are sometimes seen. from table  <dig> we can also see that in the homologs we examined, the fifth position never contains a large hydrophobic residue. from the statistics of table  <dig> two patterns with good coverage and p-values are hy¯hyghyxhyxhy and hy¯hyghyhy¯hyxhy. the p-values for these two patterns are nearly the same for the background sequence regions from mbomp proteins used to compute them. however we would expect the more specific pattern hy¯hyghyhy¯hyxhy to discriminate better when non β-barrel sequences are included in the background. in that case a requirement of no prolines could also be considered as an extra filter, or alternatively a position weight matrix covering these positions could be defined.

amongst the putative mbomp homologs, we found  <dig> exceptions to the core β-signal consensus, and  <dig> of them were in mdm <dig>  mdm <dig> also differs from the other mbomp families in that it has no known homologs in animals.

even the exceptions contain the apparently invariant glycine and exhibit the length  <dig> periodicity expected in a β-strand. however, our stastical analysis of the frequency of β-signal motifs in the c-terminal versus other parts of mbomp sequences  suggest that the non-glycine positions of the β-signal may contribute to its recognition in a more specific way than just by providing an appropriate secondary structure context.

recent experimental work suggests that the β-signal is not necessary for mitochondrial outer membrane integration. walther et al.  <cit>  reported that, when expressed in yeast, some bbomps were sorted to the mitochondrial outer membrane. in particular the c-terminus of omp85_neimb does not even have a near match to the β-signal . it remains to be seen if any naturally occurring mbomps lack a β-signal. as discussed above, in a eukaryote-wide search, removing the β-signal filter leads to an unmanageable number of candidates. one idea for future work, would be to use a bacterial-type c-terminal phenylalanine integration signal motif  <cit>  as an alternative filter.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a novel mbomp predictor, and used it to perform a eukaryotic-wide search for β-signal dependent mbomps, and a β-signal independent search in yeast and arabidopsis. in the eukaryotic-wide search we found no promising new mbomp candidates. likewise in the yeast β-signal independent search we found no promising new mbomp candidates. the results of the β-signal independent arabidopsis search were less conclusive. we found one potentially promising new bomp candidate and  <dig> more candidate bomps which do not appear to have sequence or structural similarities to known bomps. we could not find corroborating evidence to support these candidates, so their confirmation or refutation must await further work.

we conclude that the currently identified mbomp protein families may represent a nearly complete repertoire of β-signal dependent mbomps. if many undiscovered mbomp families remain in the current sequence databases, they most likely differ from known mbomps significantly in terms of structure or biogenesis.
