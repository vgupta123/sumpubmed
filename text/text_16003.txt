BACKGROUND
foxtail millet  was domesticated in neolithic china approximately  <dig>  years ago. it has been regarded as an important dietary staple in china for many millennia. although it is closely related to the major food and feed crops maize and sorghum, the required growth conditions and low productivity have limited the potential of foxtail millet  <cit> . foxtail millet has a relatively small genome ; it is a c <dig> panicoid crop with relatively low amounts of repetitive dna, a short life-cycle, and is self-pollinating  <cit> . it has prolific seed production and has close phylogenetic relationships with several biofuel crops such as switch grass , napier grass , and pearl millet   <cit> . unsurprisingly, considering that foxtail millet is a cereal crop with excellent drought tolerance, there is an extensive germplasm collection available for research and the plant has become a prominent model genetic system for use in the study of the evolution and physiology of c <dig> photosynthesis and abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms, particularly for salinity and dehydration stress . these features accentuate the potential of using this crop as an experimental model system to investigate the stress resistance mechanisms and of using this crop as a source from which to mine abiotic stress responsive genes.

the pentatricopeptide repeat  proteins represent one of the largest protein families in land plants . this family was identified serendipitously over a decade ago as a result of bioinformatics analyses of the then incomplete arabidopsis genome sequence  <cit> . ppr proteins are characterized by the tandem array of a ppr motif, a highly degenerate unit consisting of  <dig> canonical amino acids . the vast majority of the ppr genes in each of the higher plants with sequenced genomes were found to be lacking introns, and retrotransposition has been proposed as the likely mechanism underlying the expansion of the higher plant ppr gene family  <cit> . the majority of plant ppr proteins that have been characterized to date function in important roles in a broad range of developmental and physiological processes such as respiration, cytoplasmic male sterility , embryogenesis, and photosynthesis, and few of these proteins have been proved to play a role in post-transcriptional processes associated with rna in plant organelles . ppr proteins escaped identification until complete genomic sequences became available because their primary sequences are highly degenerate. while subsequent analysis revealed that the ppr proteins are found in a few animal and fungal proteins, but it is clear that the family has expanded greatly in land plants; there are with  <dig> ppr genes in arabidopsis and  <dig> ppr genes in rice  . the vast majority of these proteins are predicted to be localized to mitochondria or chloroplasts, however, there are also a few ppr proteins that have been shown to be localized to the nucleus . most of the functional analyses of ppr proteins have been performed arabidopsis, rice, or maize , and these studies revealed that they participate in various post-transcriptional processes related to gene expression in plant organelles . functional studies of ppr proteins relating to biotic and abiotic stress response mechanisms in higher plants remain very sparse, and the characterization of these proteins remains one a major challenge in plant science.

here, we took advantage of the existing research results  <cit>  and the newly completed foxtail millet genome sequencing results to perform a genome-wide comparison of the ppr genes in  <dig> organisms distributed widely across plant lineages: the moss physcomitrella patens  <cit> , the lycophyte selaginella   <cit> , the dicot arabidopsis, and the monocots rice and foxtail millet  <cit> . our results allow us to draw definitive conclusions on the timing and causes of the expansion of the vascular plants ppr gene family. in addition, our complete analysis of all of the ppr proteins in foxtail millet enables a more comprehensive foundation from which to explore the functional and regulatory networks of ppr genes. our quantitative real-time pcr -based analysis of these gene expression patterns under specific stress treatment conditions, and our subcellular localization studies of a number of candidate sipprs provide empirical data that should greatly facilitate advances in understanding of the biological functions of these fascinating proteins in foxtail millet in particular, and in plants generally.

RESULTS
identification and classification of ppr proteins in foxtail millet
all of the  <dig> genes encoding ppr proteins in the genome of foxtail millet were identified in this paper. the phytozome locus, protein length, open reading frame  length, and each of these ppr genes chromosomal location are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  foxtail millet ppr gene/protein sequence informations, and gene annotations in this study were downloaded from the phytozome .

to better understand the phylogenetic relationships of the ppr protein-endoding genes among land plants, we identified  <dig> nonredundant putative ppr proteins in the selaginella, which is a nonseed vascular plant with a dominant and complex sporophyte generation of an ancient lineage that diverged shortly after land plants evolved vascular tissues  <cit>  . the numbers of ppr genes in foxtail millet, arabidopsis, and rice were found to be strikingly similar. there were approximately three times as many ppr genes in selaginella than in foxtail millet. the selaginella plastome sequence has a large amount of rna-edited sites, which coincides with the exceptionally large number of ppr genes in selaginella  <cit> .

given the structure of the repeated motif, ppr gene family can be split into two subfamilies; these are termed the p and pls subfamilies. on the basis of the presence of the c-terminal conserved domains, the pls subfamily can be further split into the following three subgroups: pls, e/e+ and dyw subgroups  <cit> . figure 1a details the numbers of ppr genes split by different species and subgroups and in the context of the phylogeny of plants. a large majority of the  <dig> selaginella pprs, and  <dig> sipprs, belong to the p subfamily;  <dig> selaginella pprs, and  <dig> sipprs, belong to the pls subfamily, including  <dig> and  <dig> pls subgroups,  <dig> and  <dig> dyw subgroups,  <dig> and  <dig> e/e+ subgroups ppr genes were found in selaginella and foxtail millet, respectively.fig.  <dig> the numbers of ppr genes divided by species and subgroups and in the context of the phylogeny of plants.  numbers and subclasses of ppr genes in moss, selaginella, foxtail millet, arabidopsis, rice.  motif structures of ppr proteins. schematic representation of typical plants ppr proteins from each subclass  <cit> . the number and even order of repeats can vary in individual proteins. the dashed line between the e and e+ motifs indicates that the e+ extension is not always present.  phylogeny of plants. the species and the members of pprs were labeled in end branch. vascular plants appeared ~ <dig> million years ago, then diverged into several lineages of which only two survive: the euphyllophytes  and the lycophytes  <cit> 




gene structure and chromosomal distribution of ppr genes in foxtail millet
the structures of ppr genes were determined by analyzing their exon-intron organization. the great majority of the foxtail millet ppr genes contained very few introns, as is the case with the vast majority of the selaginella ppr genes. figure  <dig> details the ratios of ppr genes in two species that contain no intron,  <dig> intron, 2– <dig> introns, and  <dig> or more introns. approximately 80 % of the arabidopsis and rice ppr genes lack introns  <cit> . intron-rich ppr genes may represent“ancient” ppr genes previous to the occurrence of retrotransposition-mediated expansion of the ppr gene family in land plants  <cit> .  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of ppr genes of, respectively, selaginella and foxtail millet, were predicted to lack introns. the  <dig> ppr genes are unevenly distributed on all  <dig> of the foxtail millet chromosomes. chromosome  <dig> of foxtail millet possesses the highest number of sipprs , while the lowest number of sipprs were found on chromosome  <dig> . for fine mapping, the exact position  of each sippr on the respective foxtail millet chromosome was obtained from phytozome and is indicated diagrammatically in fig.  <dig> . substantial clustering of ppr genes was evident on all of the chromosomes. in total,  <dig>  ppr genes were arranged in tandem repeats of two to seven genes, either in the same or the inverse direction , representing localized gene  duplications.fig.  <dig> relative proportions of intron-containing ppr genes in selaginella and foxtail millet. proportions were colored as: no introns ,  <dig> intron , 2– <dig> introns , and  <dig> or more introns 


fig.  <dig> percentage and genomic distribution of ppr genes on each the foxtail millet chromosome. ppr genes with different auxiliary domain/motif were shown in different colors. one circle represents one ppr gene. chromosome numbers were indicated at the top of each bar. blastp search was performed against the complete peptide sequences of setaria italica and the first  <dig> matches with e-value <1e- <dig> were identified as the ppr genes present on chromosomal segments duplication which were connected by black lines. the red boxes represent the ppr gene too close to connect by lines. the position  each ppr protein gene on phytozome chromosome pseudomolecules was given in the additional file 3: table s3




comparing the numbers and structures of the ppr genes in all  <dig> species, including moss, selaginella, arabidopsis, rice, and foxtail millet, the numbers of selaginella ppr genes were approximately three times as many as the other vascular plants. however, all homologous ppr genes in flowering plants also could be found in selaginella, and the intron-rich ppr genes show similar structure in all  <dig> species, which suggested the ppr gene family expanded before the divergence of the euphyllophytes  and the lycophytes . the ppr genes may have been derived from a primitive and intron-rich “ancient” ppr gene by retrotransposition  <cit> . further, we speculate that some ppr genes may be non-functional, or may even have negatively affected the transition of non-flowering to flowering in vascular plants. the expansion of the ppr gene family may be coupled with organelle evolution.

 <dig>  of the genes of the foxtail millet genome were segmentally duplicated  <cit> . among the sippr genes,  <dig>  were segmentally duplicated ; note that this proportion is far higher than that of genes generally. in particular, there were several genes that were duplicated a dramatic number of times, such as the gene si020204m , which was duplicated eleven times, forming  <dig> paralogs that can be found on all  <dig> of the foxtail millet chromosomes . these results showed that genes segmental duplications were important in the expansion of the ppr gene family in vascular plants.fig.  <dig> distribution of segmentally duplicated ppr genes on foxtail millet chromosomes. grey lines indicate collinear blocks in whole foxtail millet genome, and black lines indicate duplicated ppr gene pairs




gene ontology annotation
blast2go software performed the go slim analysis, which suggested the putative participation of sipprs in various biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components . out of the  <dig> sippr proteins, go annotation of  <dig> sequences could not be found, and the remaining  <dig> sipprs were divided into  <dig> separate categories of biological processes. the results indicated that a majority of sipprs were likely related to primary biological process , followed by post-transcriptional processes within mitochondria and chloroplasts  , and embryo development processes . of note,  <dig> sipprs were predicted to participate in responses to stress, a topic that we will address later in this text. the molecular functions of  <dig>  sipprs were predicted to participate in molecular function, such as basic catalysis or binding function. the second most frequently annotated molecular function was nucleic acid binding function . cellular localization prediction suggested that  <dig>  sippr proteins were localized in the mitochondria,  <dig>  were localized to chloroplasts, and  <dig>  sipprs were not sure localized in mitochondria or chloroplasts,  <dig> were localized in cytoplasm,  <dig> were localized in the cell nucleus, and  <dig> were localized in cell membranes . the go analysis results indicating that the sippr proteins participate in diverse biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components and will be useful for further verifications of gene functions in foxtail millet.fig.  <dig> gene ontology  distributions for the sippr protein. the blast2go program defined the gene ontology under three categories,  biological processes,  molecular functions and  cellular component




orthologous relationships
we explored the sipprs orthologous relationships by using a comparative mapping-based approach in which the physically mapped foxtail millet ppr genes were compared with those ppr genes in the chromosomes of other related grass genomes, including b. distachyon, rice, sorghum, and maize . the specific orthologous relationships could be deduced on a mean value for ~  <dig>  % proteins, maximal orthology of sipprs annotated on the setaria italica chromosomes was found in b. distachyon , followed by rice , sorghum , and maize . the widespread synteny among setaria italica, b. distachyon, rice, sorghum, and maize at gene level supports their close evolutionary relationships . of note, most of the sippr genes had syntenic tend to special chromosomes of the four species, a finding consistent with what is known about the evolution of the setaria italica genome  <cit> . the two chromosome reshuffling events that occurred in foxtail millet, rice, and sorghum were reported  <cit> . our results also suggested there may be several chromosome reshuffling events between foxtail millet and b. distachyon and maize, such as fusing b. distachyon chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> to foxtail millet chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and maize chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> to foxtail millet chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the comparative mapping information thus offers a helpful introduction for comprehending the evolution of ppr genes among those grasses, even the genome evolution of setaria italica. in addition, this research would be helpful for the selection of candidate sippr genes and exploit them in genetic improvement of related grass family members. as for example, arabidopsis ppr <dig> as a signaling link factor for the communication of mitochondrial electron transport and regulation of stress and hormonal responses. insertion mutations inactivating ppr <dig> affected plant growth and enhanced mutants sensitivity to salt, aba, and oxidative stress  <cit> . therefore, its orthologous setaria italica gene  and rice gene  may also have the similar function.table  <dig> a summary of comparative mapping of foxtail millet sippr genes on brachypodium sylvaticum, sorghum, maize and rice

duplication and divergence rates of the sippr genes
gene duplications enable the evolution of genes with novel functions. functional deficiency phenotypes occur less frequently when multiple copies of a gene are present then when there is only a single copy of a gene. genes multiple copies may evolve new gene owing to evolutionary events such as the whole genome location  and segmental duplications. such gene duplication has been described in previous reports  <cit> . therefore, we searched that the effect of darwinian positive selection in the duplication and divergence of the ppr genes. the synonymous  and non-synonymous  nucleotide substitution rates per site were determined for  <dig> location and  <dig> segmental duplication gene-pairs and between orthologous gene-pairs of sippr with those genes of moss , selaginella , arabidopsis , rice , and maize  . the non-synonymous/ synonymous ratio  is a measure of natural selection acting on a protein, in which values of ω <  <dig> indicate negative purifying selection; ω =  <dig> indicates neutral evolution; and ω >  <dig> indicates positive diversifying selection. the mean number of synonymous substitutions  across all tandemly duplicated gene pairs was  <dig>  and segmentally duplicated gene pairs were  <dig> . the mean number of non-synonymous substitutions  across all tandemly duplicated gene pairs was  <dig> , and that for segmentally duplicated gene pairs was  <dig> . even though the ω values extensive changes among gene pair groups, the average value was equal to  <dig>  and  <dig>  for tandemly duplicated gene pairs and segmentally duplicated gene pairs, respectively, suggesting that those duplicated sipprs were under very strong selection pressure, which had undergone substitution elimination and enormous selective constraint by natural selection during the course of evolution since ω <  <dig>  our analysis indicated that the duplication events leading to these location and segmental duplication sipprs may have happened approximately  <dig>  mya and  <dig>  mya , respectively. presumably, the ppr family is a quite ancient gene family and may have existed as early as in the era of bacteria and algae , and pprs were also found in ancient heterokont species  and bacterial species  <cit> . however, there were no eukaryotes in the world at that time, the ppr genes family may have derived from bacteria and/or algae, a supposition that is supported by the hypothesis of the endosymbiosis of a green algae into an ancestral host cell  <cit> . secondly, tandem duplication enabled the evolution of new functions among the ppr genes in evolutionarily diverse taxa . the result of comparing the numbers and nature of the ppr genes in all  <dig> species indicated that the ppr gene family expanded before the divergence of the euphyllophytes  and the lycophytes , and segmental duplication of sippr genes occurred around  <dig>  mya, which suggests that genome segmental duplications may be responsible for the ppr gene expansion in vascular plant .fig.  <dig> diagram showing approximate times of duplication and divergence of the plants in this study.  evolutionary relationships and approximate times of divergence of the six species in land plants  <cit> .  the time of duplication and divergence of ppr genes in foxtail millet and the orthologous gene-pairs of sippr genes with those of other species: moss, selaginella, arabidopsis, rice and maize. tandem duplication time  and segmental duplication time  of sippr genes were estimated to have occurred around  <dig>  mya and  <dig>  mya, respectively




among the sippr orthologous gene-pairs with those of other four species, moss, selaginella, arabidopsis, rice, and maize, the value of ω was maximum between rice and foxtail millet , maize and foxtail millet , and least for moss and foxtail millet , selaginella and foxtail millet , arabidopsis and foxtail millet  . the relatively higher ω between the sippr genes of maize and foxtail millet and rice and foxtail millet show their earlier divergence around  <dig>  mya and  <dig>  mya, the divergence time is in agreement with the recent time of divergence of maize-foxtail millet and rice-foxtail millet   <cit> . however, the divergence time of moss-foxtail millet, selaginella-foxtail millet  and arabidopsis-foxtail millet  were far earlier than the time of divergence of monocots and dicots, which suggested the ppr gene family may share some common “ancient” ppr genes in land plants .

the estimation of tandem duplication time  of foxtail millet ppr genes is later than the divergence time of moss-foxtail millet , selaginella-foxtail millet , and earlier than the divergence time of arabidopsis-foxtail millet , maize-foxtail millet  and rice-foxtail millet . segmental duplication time  of foxtail millet ppr genes is later than the divergence time of moss-foxtail millet , selaginella-foxtail millet , and arabidopsis-foxtail millet , but earlier than maize-foxtail millet  and rice-foxtail millet . remarkably, the orthologous ppr gene-pairs between moss-foxtail millet , selaginella-foxtail millet , and arabidopsis-foxtail millet  appear to have undergone extensive intense purifying selection, as compared to average ω values of the foxtail millet-rice  and foxtail millet-maize  ppr gene pairs. consequently, we can draw a conclusion that the tandemly and segmentally duplicated events, including the divergence events of the pprs from other species, have played a critical role in the evolution process of this gene family in foxtail millet, and genome segmental duplications may be responsible for the ppr gene expansion in vascular plant.

functional conservation of ppr proteins in foxtail millet
most functional analyses of ppr proteins undertaken to date have only tested proteins from arabidopsis, rice, or maize, and there is as yet very limited information regarding the evolutionary relationships between ppr proteins within or across species. the ppr gene family existed in the era of bacteria and green algae, and ppr proteins are mostly aimed at mitochondria or plastids in terrestrial plants  <cit> . it has been suggested that the origin and evolution of the ppr gene family may be inextricably coupled with the endosymbiosis of mitochondria and chloroplasts in the early evolutionary history of eukaryotes and plants  <cit> .

ppr proteins can be classified based on motif structure and the presence of additional c-terminal domains. subgroupings include the p and pls subfamilies and the p-class ppr proteins presented the presence of one or more known/unknown functional motifs or domains, such as an rna recognition motif   <cit>  and laglidadg domain  <cit> . those pprs with the same domain always are intron rich  and tended to be located in the same organelles in moss, selaginella, arabidopsis, rice and foxtail millet , respectively. comparison of the gene structures and amino acid sequences encoded by ppr proteins containing the same domains showed that these were well conserved among the five species , indicating that these attributes had been preserved during evolution. this suggested that these homologous pprs likely share the same or similar origins and functions, and further suggest that these the intron-rich ppr genes of moss may represent “ancient” ppr genes previous to the occurrence of retrotransposition-mediated  <cit>  or/and segmental duplication-mediated the ppr family expansion in terrestrial plants. such conservation was likely very important for the survival and development of the chloroplast and mitochondria in these  <dig> species, perhaps even in all land plants. for instance, the ppr-smr motif containing proteins of arabidopsis  and the corresponding maize orthologs  were found to be localized to the chloroplast and to have the same or similar functions . the arabidopsis protein  contains two laglidadg motifs that are known to specifically promote the splicing of introns, and loss of atotp <dig> affected the assembly of the psi complex  <cit> . the rice protein  was found to have a similar function with atotp <dig>  and loss-of-function osotp <dig> affected the intron splicing of a number of plastid genes, indirectly affected the structure and functions of psi, and resulted in severe photoinhibition and eventual plant death, even when mutant plants were grown under very low light  <cit> . this example of conservation suggests that such homologous ppr proteins are important for the growth and development of plants and they preserved their ancient functions.fig.  <dig> the pprs contain rrm and laglidadg domain were selected to example the intron conservation in the homologous ppr genes. in each figure, the fist panel shows the gene structure and the second panel shows the motif structure, protein size, and target location of the predicted ppr proteins




in order to investigate the functional conservation of the ppr proteins in foxtail millet, we examined the presence of ppr-laglidadg proteins in a broad range of species to explore their origins and diversification. the ppr-laglidadg proteins were essentially only found in eukaryotic species and were largely limited to the viridiplantae clade. we then investigated the function of siotp <dig>  it contains a ppr motif and an laglidadg_ <dig> motif. we transformed siotp <dig> into arabidopsis atotp51- <dig> and atotp51- <dig> mutants using a plasmid containing siotp <dig> under the control of the 35s cauliflower mosaic virus promoter. homozygous atotp51- <dig> and atotp51- <dig> mutants exhibited identical phenotypes: seedlings were light straw yellow; rosettes were light yellow in standard light and pale green for young leaves in low light conditions; plants had retarded growth and greening  <cit>  . complementation mutants of atotp <dig> with the arabidopsis atotp <dig> gene ortholog siotp <dig> showed that siotp <dig> would to a certain extent reverse the mutant phenotypes. this would suggested that siotp <dig> may also affect photosynthesis and plastid gene expression. the molecular functions of otp51s in all land plants may be conserved.fig.  <dig> the phenotype of arabidopsis seeding at two weeks old under low light conditions, which transformed siotp <dig> into atotp51- <dig> and atotp51- <dig> mutants.  schematic representation of atotp <dig> and siotp <dig> showed the gene or protein structure. boxes and lines indicate exons and introns, respectively.  positions of the two t-dna insertions in the atotp <dig> gene. salk_ <dig> was named atotp51- <dig> and sail_713d <dig> was named atotp51- <dig>   phenotype of two atotp <dig> mutant seedling and reverse mutation of atotp <dig> mutants with siotp <dig> gene in low light conditions at two weeks old




expression of sippr genes under abiotic stress conditions and abscisic acid  treatment
the exposure of plants to changes in environment conditions and the treatment of plants with phytohormones is known to elicite various physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses, causing alterations in gene expression  <cit> . some pprs have been proved to function in post-transcriptional and post-translational processes and have been classified as sequence-specific rna-binding proteins  <cit> . however, the function of the vast majority of ppr proteins remain to be characterized, and there is very limited information about this family in higher plants. this dearth of information is especially pronounced regarding the potential function of these proteins in plant responses to abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments. to explore the potential functions of ppr proteins in stress and/or phytohormone responses in higher plants, the expression of the foxtail millet ppr genes was analyzed in plants that had been grown under drought treatment . we performed an rna-seq experiment of total rna isolated from 4-week-old foxtail millet seedlings, including leaves and roots .  <dig> ppr genes were identified which were differentially expressed  between plants grown under drought stress conditions and control plants. a heat map was got according to the rpkm values for the  <dig> genes.  <dig> genes were up-regulated;  <dig> genes were down-regulated genes . then we examined the expression patterns of  <dig> ppr genes, including  <dig> ppr genes that were up-regulated expression,  <dig> ppr genes were down-regulated expression, and  <dig> selected from go annotation , using qrt-pcr analysis of samples from plants, including leaves and roots, subjected to drought, salt, cold, and aba treatment. a heat map illustration of expression patterns of  <dig> selected sippr genes is exhibited in fig.  <dig>  the qrt-pcr results of most candidate genes under abiotic stress condition  were agreement with the rna-seq experiment under drought treated . seven of these genes were up-regulated and three were down-regulated; four showed no-response under any of the treatments . three were up-regulated under salt and cold, but down-regulated under drought and aba; four were up-regulated under salt, cold, and aba, but no response under drought stress; four ppr protein-encoding genes were up-regulated under salt and cold stresses, but no response under drought stress and aba; one showed up-regulation under drought stress and cold, but no response under salt and aba . three were up-regulated under salt treatment, one was down-regulated under aba, one was up-regulated under drought stress, and one was up-regulated under cold stress .fig.  <dig> expression profiles of foxtail millet ppr genes differentially expressed under abiotic stress conditions and abscisic acid  treatment.  expression profiles of foxtail millet ppr genes differentially expressed under all four,  any three or two,  and specific stress condition as compared to the control seedlings were presented. the values of sippr genes under control and various stress conditions  were presented by cluster display . the color scale  was shown at the bottom




of the  <dig> predicted ppr proteins in arabidopsis, only five mitochondrion-localized proteins and one cytosol-nucleus dual-localized ppr protein were proved to function in response to abiotic stresses and/or aba. arabidopsis ppr40-mediated ubiqinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity in mitochondrion complex iii and it was related to oxidative respiration that also conducive to abiotic stress tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . abo <dig> was required for cis-splicing of the mitochondrial nad <dig> intron  <dig>  and altered the expression of several stress-responsive and nuclear-encoded genes to affect the aba signaling pathway  <cit> . the pgn can regulate the ros homeostasis in plants mitochondria during abiotic and biotic stress responses may occur through the regulation of mitochondria-nucleus retrograde signaling. ahg <dig> regulates the nad <dig>  transcriptional level and thus led to changes in oxidative levels by controlling rna editing events in plants mitochondria and affecting plant responses to aba  <cit> . slg <dig> regulated the nad <dig>  transcript by regulating rna editing events in mitochondria and affecting the expression of genes which were involved in the alternative respiratory pathway  <cit> . soar <dig>  was identified recently as a crucial regulator in the chlh/abar -mediated signaling pathway that acts downstream of chlh/abar and upstream of a nuclear aba-responsive bzip transcription factor, abi <dig>  <cit> . qrt-pcr results showed that  <dig> sipprs were up-regulated under any three abiotic stress treatment . these sipprs may have a similar stress response mechanism with arabisopsis pprs . in addition, the class of ppr proteins that can edit rna are of the pls subfamily, and the e+ motif is required for the conversion of c to u rna editing  <cit> . consistent with their functions, six stress-related ppr proteins, including pgn, ahg <dig>  and slg <dig>  belonged to the e subgroup, and ppr <dig>  abo <dig>  and soar <dig> belonged to the p subgroup. it has been suggested that the mitochondrial localization of p subgroup or e subgroup ppr proteins may participate in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress.

subcellular localization of foxtail millet ppr proteins
based on the expression of sippr genes in plants grown under abiotic stress conditions,  <dig> candidates ppr proteins were selected for verification of the subcellular localization, including  <dig> up-regulated under any of the treatments, and  <dig> up-regulated under salt, cold, and aba. among these  <dig>   <dig> proteins were predicted by targetp to be localized to chloroplasts,  <dig> proteins were predicted to be targeted to mitochondria, and  <dig> protein was predicted to be localized to cytoplasm  <cit> . those foxtail millet ppr genes were cloned and inserted into a subcellular localization vector that included a gfp protein-encoding gene under the control of the 35s promoter; these vectors were transformed into foxtail millet protoplasts. to confirm that the putative mitochondrion-targeted ppr proteins were expressed in the mitochondria, we stained transformed foxtail millet protoplasts with a mitochondria-specific dye  <cit> , and then observed the samples with  <dig> and 543 nm illumination.  <dig> of these proteins were localized to chloroplasts and  <dig> were localized to mitochondria and  <dig> located to the cytoplasm . among  <dig> sippr genes,  <dig> belong to the p subfamily and  <dig> belong to the pls subfamily. most of pprs located to chloroplasts or mitochondria were consistent with the results predicted by targetp. however, si032871m and si006059m, which were predicted to be localized to mitochondria, were localized to the cytoplasm. ppr proteins involved in abiotic stresses and aba were localized to the cytoplasm and/or mitochondria . these results suggest that the  <dig> mitochondrion-localized genes and the  <dig> cytoplasm-localized sippr proteins may be viewed as candidates implicated in plant responses to adverse environmental conditions and exogenous phytohormones.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of sippr protein. fluorescence signals were visualized with  <dig> and 543 nm illumination using a zeiss lsm <dig> confocal laser-scanning microscopy. green fluorescence showed gfp, red fluorescence indicates chloroplast autofluorescence or stained protoplasts used mitotracker orange and yellow fluorescence indicated images with the two types of fluorescence merged.  empty gfp vector without a specific targeting sequence and chloroplasts location of the sippr-gfp fusion protein.  mitochondria location of the sippr-gfp fusion protein, red fluorescence indicated mitochondria.  green fluorescence shows the proteins located to other organelles, red fluorescence indicated mitochondria. bars = 5 mm.  to  were foxtail millet protoplasts




chloroplasts and mitochondria are the two main plant cellular organelles with independent genomes. under unfavorable conditions, the accumulation of ros in both chloroplasts and mitochondria increases oxidative stress and this acts as a signal to help the plant respond to unfavorable environmental conditions. it is known that ppr proteins are mostly aimed at plastids and mitochondria in plants, and the mitochondrial/chloroplast ppr proteins play various and crucial roles in plant developmental processes and responses to environmental stresses . however, there is not much information about the chloroplast localization of ppr proteins in response to abiotic stresses. to date, the only reported chloroplast-localized ppr protein, gun <dig>  was found to be a central regulator of plastid to nucleus retrograde signaling, and its impairment led to abi4-mediated repression of nuclear-encoded genes and enhanced sensitivity to aba  <cit> . the subcellular localization assays of  <dig> foxtail millet ppr proteins in our study revealed that  <dig> members were located to chloroplasts, and these candidate proteins seem to be responsive to diverse abiotic stresses .

CONCLUSIONS
pentatricopeptide repeat  proteins are extensive in terrestrial plants, and the genomes of terrestrial plants typically include several hundred genes encoding these proteins. most of pprs are targeted to plastids and mitochondria, where they play crucial roles in mechanisms controlling post-transcriptional processes. however, functional studies of pprs in terrestrial plants remain scarce. this study provides evidence that the period of the expansion of the ppr gene family occurred prior to the divergence of the euphyllophytes  and the lycophytes . our results also suggest that genome segmental duplications were responsible for the expansion of the ppr gene family in vascular plants. in addition, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the sippr genes/proteins that included classification, chromosomal location, orthologous relationships, duplication analysis, and auxiliary motifs. we conducted expression pattern analysis of  <dig> candidate sippr genes in plants grown under stress conditions, and performed subcellular localization analysis of  <dig> ppr proteins. our study establishes an empirical foundation for further investigations seeking to elucidate the precise role of individual pprs in foxtail millet.
