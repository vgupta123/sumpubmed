BACKGROUND
chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is considered a subdisease of chronic rhinosinusitis  <cit> . nasal polyps are found in 20% of the cases of chronic rhinosinusitis  <cit> , and most polyps originate in the clefts of the osteomeatal complex. the overall prevalence rate for the disease in the general population ranges from 1-4%  <cit> . the immune cell infiltration identified in nasal polyps is a mixed one; it includes eosinophils, and these constitute more than 10% of the cells of nasal polyps in the caucasian population. the number of cd <dig> positive and cd <dig> positive activated t lymphocytes also increases in nasal polyps  <cit> . the pattern of immune cell infiltration to the polyps in non-allergic as opposed to allergic patients who have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps has been demonstrated to be different. in non-allergic patients, fewer cd4+ cells in the epithelium and more cd8+ cells in the lamina propria were found than in the same tissues of the patients who had allergies. the number of macrophages increases as well in nasal polyps. these cells have enhanced mannose receptor expression, which is capable of phagocytosis and signals transduction for pro-inflammatory mechanisms  <cit> .

the histomorphological characterization of nasal polyp tissue reveals frequent epithelial damage, a thickened basement membrane, and edematous or sometimes fibrotic stromal tissue with a reduced number of vessels and glands  <cit> .

nasal polyps constitute a multifactorial disease. significant participating factors include infectious as well as noninfectious inflammation and anatomic and genetic abnormalities. allergic and nonallergic rhinitis as well as allergic fungal sinusitis, aspirin intolerance, asthma, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and kartagener syndrome are all associated with nasal polyps. furthermore, nasal polyps are believed to represent the final stage of chronic nasal inflammation  <cit> .

as in our previous study, we demonstrated that nasal polyps develop resistance to immune-mediated apoptosis and are able to express factors by which the activity of infiltrating immune cells can be regulated. in the present study we have focused on the analysis of metallothionein in nasal polyps  <cit> .

metallothionein  is a small , thiol-rich protein  <cit> . the expression and induction of metallothionein has been associated with protection against both oxidative stress and apoptosis. this is because thiols participate in complexing with divalent metal cations. when metallothionein binds to essential divalent metals , it may serve as a metal reservoir for apo-enzymes and zinc-finger transcription regulators  <cit> . apoptosis has also been increased in mt-null cells  <cit> . mt has been found to be associated with the enhanced proliferation of cells in esophageal, breast, and nasopharyngeal cancers  <cit> . since mt function includes the maintenance of proper intracellular zn2+ level, and the proper intracellular zn2+ level is responsible for the regulation of caspase- <dig> activity, zn2+ has been observed to inhibit caspase- <dig> activity. caspase - <dig> controls the essential step of apoptosis and is responsible for dna fragmentation  <cit> . the potential role of metallothionein in the modulation of apoptosis may depend on the nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of mt in the cell. cytoplasmic mt is thought to protect against cytotoxicity whereas nuclear mt protects against genotoxicity  <cit> .

e. canpolat et al. has proposed that mt may serve as a negative regulator of the immune response and so suppress the autoimmune attack on self-tissues. indeed, the induction of mt by glucocorticoids may explain the role they play in treating autoimmune diseases  <cit> .

the aim of the present study has been to evaluate mt immunoreactivity in nasal polyps with respect to the type of immune cell infiltration present. for this purpose, we have considered the presence of macrophages, cd <dig> positive th lymphocytes, and cd <dig> antigen immunoreactivity. we have also repeated the analysis of rcas <dig> expression so that we can consider its expression in relation to immune cell presence and activity. the major function of rcas <dig> expression is to inhibit activated immune cells, such as t and b lymphocytes and nk cells, and to induce their apoptosis. rcas <dig> as expressed on cancer cells is responsible for both tumor escape from host immunological surveillance and the creation of immune tolerance toward tumor cells  <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that macrophages stimulated with lps -enhanced rcas <dig> expression together with the induced apoptosis of the progenitor cells of the erythroblast line through rcas <dig> play an important regulatory role in erythropoesis  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that rcas <dig> can be found only on activated monocytes  <cit> . because rcas1-positive macrophages represent a population of cells capable of regulating immune system cell activity in a negative manner, their presence in the nasal polyp microenvironment may also help to create a local immunosuppressive microenvironment.

RESULTS
the analysis of mt expression in nasal polyps
metallothionein immunoreactivity was identified in all the examined nasal polyp tissue samples and this immunoreactivity was intracellular.

eosinophilic nasal polyps
mt immunoreactivity was found in all the examined tissue samples derived from the eosinophilic nasal polyps and was present in the epithelium lining the nasal polyps; it represented a nuclear pattern of staining . mt immunoreactivity was also present in the stroma of nasal polyps where it represented a nuclear and cytoplasmic staining pattern .

lymphocytic nasal polyps
mt immunoreactivity was identified in all the examined lymphocytic nasal polyps, and as was the case with the eosinophilic nasal polyps, was found to be present in both the epithelial cells and the stroma .

neutrophilic nasal polyps
the mt staining pattern was weak in the epithelium lining both the polyps and the stroma. no other examined antigens  were identified in the neutrophilic nasal polyps. on account of these findings, the neutrophilic nasal polyps were excluded from further consideration in the study.

interestingly, exceptionally high mt expression was found in the stroma of the nasal polyps that were adjacent to bone. moreover, the osteoblasts of the adjacent bone showed high levels of mt immunoreactivity. this immunoreactivity was observed in all the bone fragments obtained for the study with nasal polyps regardless of the type of the immune cell infiltration in the polyps. no other bone fragment regions exhibited mt immunoreactivity.

comparison of mt immunoreactivity in eosinophilic and lymphocytic nasal polyps
mt expression within the epithelium was statistically significantly higher in the eosinophilic than in the lymphocytic nasal polyps . mt stromal expression was higher in the eosinophilic nasal polyps than in the lymphocytic, but the difference was not statistically significant. a statistically significant correlation, however, was found between mt expression in the epithelium and in the stroma .

the analysis of immune cells in nasal polyps
cd <dig> positive cells
cd  <dig> positive cells  were identified in both the stroma and the epithelium lining the nasal polyps. the number of scattered cells in the stroma ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in a hpf. in the edematic area of the nasal polyp stroma, the number of inflammatory cells was high, and the number of cd <dig> positive cells increased to 8- <dig> in a hpf. overall, the number of macrophages was statistically significantly higher in the tissue of the eosinophilic nasal polyps than in that of the lymphocytic nasal polyps  .

the analysis of rcas1
while in our previous study we identified rcas <dig> expression in nasal polyps, in the current study we have also evaluated this expression in nasal polyps  <cit> . strong cytoplasmic rcas <dig> immunoreactivity was found in the epithelium lining the polyps, and was additionally present in the extra-cellular mucus. moreover, rcas <dig> immunoreactivity was observed in the mucous glands, but was weaker than in the surface epithelium. as in the previous study, the rcas <dig> immunoreactivity level in the epithelium lining the polyps was significantly higher in the lymphocytic nasal polyps than in the eosinophilic polyps. likewise, in the present study the level of rcas <dig> immunoreactivity in the epithelium lining the nasal polyps was significantly higher in the lymphocytic nasal polyps than in the eosinophilic polyps  . additionally the stroma of eosinophilic polyps contained single rcas <dig> positive cells that were dispersed within the immunological infiltration and were identified as cd <dig> positive cells. these same cells were not found in the lymphocytic nasal polyps.

cd <dig> rcas <dig> positive cells were observed to migrate from the stroma of the nasal polyps through the epithelium  to the mucus.

cd <dig> antigen expression was observed in  <dig> % of the eosinophilic nasal polyps and in  <dig> % of the lymphocytic nasal polyps. no differences, however, were observed between the eosinophilic and lymphocytic nasal polyps with respect to cd <dig> expression .

cd  <dig> expression was statistically significantly higher in the eosinophilic nasal polyps than in the lymphocytic nasal polyps  .

the comparative analysis of mt and rcas <dig> expression and immune cell activity
a statistically significant correlation was found between cd <dig> expression on immune cells and mt expression in the epithelium of nasal polyps  as well as between cd <dig> expression on immune cells and mt expression in the stroma of the nasal polyps . no statistically significant correlations were found, however, between mt and rcas <dig> immunoreactivity on these same cells and tissues.

discussion
in the present study, statistically significant differences in mt expression in both the epithelium and stroma of the nasal polyps with accompanying alterations in activation markers on immune cells and in the number of macrophages were found when comparing the eosinophilic and lymphocytic nasal polyps. in our previous study, we demonstrated that nasal polyp tissue develops a resistance to immune-mediated apoptosis in accordance with increasing immune cell infiltration. this has been recognized by evaluating the expression of dff- <dig> and depended on the predominant immune cell infiltration profile. nasal polyp tissue has also been shown to regulate the activity of infiltrating immune cells by the expression of rcas <dig>  a protein that inhibits the activity of immune cells and induces their apoptosis  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first investigation concerning mt immunoreactivity in nasal polyps with regard to the type of immune cell infiltration.

nasal polyps are infiltrated by a variety of immunological cells---eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells, mast cells, and macrophages, lymphocytes, and their subgroups have all been found in nasal polyps  <cit> . the lymphocytes that infiltrate nasal polyps have been identified as predominantly memory t cells in an activated state and these produced a mixed th1/th <dig> cytokine pattern   <cit> . in our study, no differences were observed between the lymphocytic and eosinophilic nasal polyps as far as cd <dig> antigen expression. the flow cytometry analysis of lymphocytes isolated from nasal polyps revealed a significant increase of il- <dig> receptor and icam- <dig> molecule expression on t cells isolated from nasal polyps when compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes  <cit> . in our study, cd <dig> expression was present in both the eosinophilic and lymphocytic nasal polyps and the level of expression was statistically significantly higher in the eosinophilic nasal polyps than in the lymphocytic polyps. this may be a result of the intensity of the immune response in these polyps and may suggest a greater number of cells able to respond to the increased il- <dig> expression. higher cd <dig> immunoreactivity in the eosinophilic nasal polyp stroma in comparison to that in lymphocytic nasal polyp stroma may also suggest the presence of treg cells typified by cd <dig> expression and may result from the level of immune tolerance developing in the polyp microenvironment due to chronic inflammation. additionally, in the present study, a statistically significant correlation was found between cd <dig> and mt immunoreactivity in the stroma of the nasal polyps . while on the one hand this correlation may result from mt immunoregulatory function  <cit> , on the other hand it could be the result of the development of the resistance to immune-mediated apoptosis in the stromal cells that are exposed to excessive immune response in the microenvironment of the nasal polyps and so may constitute a protective reaction by these cells  <cit> .

the accumulation of mannose-receptor positive macrophages that has been reported in nasal polyps in cell aggregates suggests that these cells play a key role in the pathogen-macrophage interaction in nasal polyps  <cit> . the number of macrophages in our study was statistically significantly higher in the eosinophilic than in the lymphocytic nasal polyps. rcas1-positive macrophages were identified only in the eosinophilic nasal polyps. this may be due to the different type of immune infiltration pattern in these kinds of nasal polyps. rcas1-positive macrophages are exclusively identified in normal and pathological conditions; moreover, they have been identified immunohistochemically among macrophages in hematopoietic tissue  <cit> . additionally, rcas1-positive macrophages have been found in the peripheral blood of patients with hodgkin's lymphoma, those with inflammatory liver diseases, and those suffering from ovarian endometriosis  <cit> . because rcas <dig> is responsible for the regulation of immune cell activity and may induce immune cell apoptosis, it is possible that it participates in the immune suppression phenomenon  <cit> . rcas1-positive macrophages may indeed suppress the activity of the infiltrating immune cells. this mechanism may in turn help to develop immune tolerance so that the nasal polyps maintain their growth and development. matushima et al. observed rcas <dig> only on activated macrophages in bone marrow  <cit> ; enjoji et al., however, observed rcas1-expressing macrophages in the livers of patients with inflammatory liver diseases  <cit> . furthermore, the number of macrophages increased as the inflammation increased  <cit> . in general, two types of macrophages can be identified according to their respective functions: one type promoting an antitumor immune response and the second type promoting a th <dig> response in the tumor microenvironment. the m <dig> phenotypes interleukin  <dig> high, interleukin  <dig> high, and interleukin  <dig> low, along with the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates and inflammatory cytokines, induce effector cells in th <dig> responses. by contrast, the m <dig> phenotypes, interleukin  <dig> low, interleukin  <dig> low, and interleukin  <dig> high, participate in polarized th <dig> responses. m <dig> tumor-associated macrophages were shown to promote tumor proliferation and progression, stimulate angiogenesis, and inhibit adaptive immunity  <cit> . since rcas1-positive macrophages seem to exhibit a regulatory function, we speculate that they belong to the m <dig> phenotype, and we have recently described their presence in the head and neck cancer microenvironment  <cit> .

the presence of rcas1-positive macrophages in eosinophilic nasal polyps may only prove that lymphocytic nasal polyps differ from eosinophilic polyps with respect to the degree of the disturbance in immune response regulation that can be detected in the nasal polyp microenvironment. the ongoing inflammation in the nasal polyps may lead to a change in the function of the macrophages related possibly to rcas <dig> expression and leading to the creation of the immune suppressive microenvironment, thus helping to sustain local inflammation. this may affect both the course of the disease and the outcome of the treatment. furthermore, such polyps tend to recur.

the local inflammation enhances the infiltration of immune cells and the accumulation of inflammatory mediators that may injure the adjacent epithelium, thus inducing the apoptosis of healthy cells. normal cells acquire resistance to immune-mediated apoptosis in order to protect themselves against the inflammatory process. the increasing resistance to immune-mediated apoptosis was identified in our previous report by the presence of decreased dff- <dig> protein expression in nasal polyp tissue  <cit>  and most likely reinforces the development of nasal polyps. mt was established as an anti-apoptotic protein  <cit> . intracellular mt expression in nasal polyps may assure that a resistance to immune-mediated apoptosis in nasal polyps is acquired. on the one hand, mt seems to play a protective role against apoptosis chiefly by maintaining the proper level of intracellular zinc ions. this is because the level of these intercellular ions is directly responsible for caspase- <dig> activity, which is in turn responsible for the dna cleavage  <cit> . on the other hand, mt may also play an important immunomodulating role and some have proposed that it is a negative regulator of immune response  <cit> . the level of mt expression in our study depended on the pattern of immune infiltration and was found in both the stroma tissue and bone fragments adjacent to the nasal polyps, indicating the reaction of the entire adjacent tissue to the increasing aggressiveness of the immune response.

it has been demonstrated that the spread of the inflammation in chronic rhinosinusitis may be related to the inflammation taking place within the bony walls underneath the inflamed mucosa of chronic rhinosinusitis. the histopathological examination of ethmoid bone fragments obtained from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis revealed the presence of bone remodeling along with the features of neo-osteogenesis  <cit> . „osteitis” is defined as a superficial inflammation of the bones without the bone marrow spaces  and is a variant of osteomyelitis  <cit> . because chronic rhinosinusitis may induce the inflammatory process in the bones of the paranasal sinuses, the presence of mt immunoreactivity in the bones adjacent to inflamed mucosa may also be a manifestation of the spread of the inflammatory process.

CONCLUSIONS
mt expression seems to favor the survival of nasal polyp epithelial cells in the adjacent area of increasingly cytotoxic immune activity. additionally, the rcas1- positive macrophages present only in the eosinophilic nasal polyps seem to be involved in creating the suppressive microenvironment in nasal polyps.
