BACKGROUND
the thoroughbred, a “hot-blooded” horse breed, is the favorite breed for use in horse racing
 <cit> . the speed and agility of thoroughbred horses has resulted in the emergence of an industry involved in the breeding, training, and racing of elite racehorses worth many billions of dollars
 <cit> . until now, relatively few genes related to their athletic phenotypes have been identified, even though physical and physiological adaptations underlying their elite athleticism are well characterized
 <cit> . muscle is the most critical tissue for athletic performance. the skeletal muscle of the thoroughbred horse comprises over 55% of its total body mass
 <cit>  and has remarkable functional and structural plasticity
 <cit> . furthermore, over  <dig> hereditary conditions in horses have corresponding human disorders
 <cit> , and many muscle disorders in humans and horses share common clinical and histopathological characteristics, as well as molecular features
 <cit> . therefore, the horse can be an invaluable animal model for muscle diseases.

an international team of researchers has decoded the genome of the domestic horse, equus caballus, and has reported that its genome structure is remarkably similar to the human genome
 <cit> . an additional nine domesticated horse breeds have also been sequenced, identifying around one million single nucleotide polymorphisms 
 <cit> . however, there has been little progress in refining the functional annotation of horse genome using expressed genes. although a small number  of expressed sequence tags  has been deposited in the dbest
 <cit> , this is insufficient to identify all the key genes related to specific functions, such as racing performance.

rna-seq is one of the most useful next generation sequencing  methods used to fully understand the landscape of a transcriptome, because it produces several tens of millions of short reads  from the expressed genes in vivo. rna-seq has been used successfully to investigate the transcriptome profiles of human, mouse, arabidopsis, and yeast
 <cit> . the rna-seq data generally exhibit a high degree of concordance with established gene annotations
 <cit> . using rna-seq, researchers have identified numerous novel genes and additional alternative splicing forms
 <cit> , as well as unraveling expression profiles underlying phenotypic changes, such as development stages
 <cit> . in addition, rna-seq permits the identification of single nucleotide variations  in coding regions from various organisms because of the large number of reads
 <cit> . moreover, rna-seq has identified novel unannotated transcriptionally active regions in rice
 <cit> , indicating that there are novel genes that cannot be detected by conventional gene prediction methods.

in horses, two transcriptome studies using rna-seq have been reported: one study refined the structural annotation of protein-coding genes based on the rna-seq sequences from several equine tissues
 <cit> , while the other analyzed rna-seq sequences acquired from skeletal muscle to find long-term training-related genes
 <cit> . both studies used very short rna-seq sequences, 17 bp and 35 bp, respectively, because of the limitation of ngs technologies available at that time. these very short-read rna sequences have one critical limitation. when aligned against the reference genome, the typical success rate is as low as 66% in the case of 17 bp rna fragments
 <cit> . this was caused not only by the very short-read sequences, but also by intron junctions, which were not included in the short-reads. this disadvantage must be overcome to advance horse transcriptome research.

here, we present a large scale analysis of whole transcriptome data. the samples were taken from blood and muscle tissues of six thoroughbred horses before and after 30 minutes of exercises, resulting in  <dig> samples.

RESULTS
gene cluster analysis and identification of novel transcripts from the horse rna-seq sequences
to construct high quality horse transcriptome data, we generated over  <dig>  billion 90-bp pair-end reads using an illumina hiseq <dig> . using tophat
 <cit>  and cufflinks
 <cit> ,  <dig> % of all the reads were successfully mapped against the current horse reference genome . a novel bioinformatics protocol for processing large amounts of transcriptome sequences was built . rna sequences were obtained from  <dig> different samples; therefore, we defined a new concept, unigene cluster , which contains overlapped unigene sequences originating from multiple samples. utilizing the current annotation ,  <dig>  unigene clusters , with a total length of  <dig>  mb, were identified.  <dig>  ucs matched current gene models, which comprised  <dig> % of the  <dig>  ucs 
 <cit> . the remaining  <dig>  ucs , which contained more than 60% of the transcripts, were novel . the expressions of eight randomly selected novel ucs were confirmed by reverse transcription pcr . in addition, the unmapped raw sequences were processed by soapdenovo
 <cit> , resulting in assemblies of  <dig>  to  <dig>  scaffolds for each sample. these assembled sequences increased the extent of the current horse genome . when we pooled the scaffolds together, we identified around  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes. 27% to 46% of these unigenes from each sample were matched to human genes using tblastx . 

identification and dissection of novel snvs from a large amount of horse rna-seq sequences
we identified  <dig>  non-redundant snps and  <dig>  non-redundant indels from the  <dig> samples using several filters, including an exon-intron boundary misalignment filter . the filters had been validated on mouse rna-seq data
 <cit>  by showing that  <dig> % of the identified snps were confirmed in two inbred mouse genomes . each horse showed a similar number of snvs, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .  <dig>  individual-specific snvs were identified . only  <dig>  out of  <dig>  snps  overlapped with both of the two existing databases . this is because only 1%  of the snps from the two databases were located in the exonic region of the current genome annotation . these results demonstrate the usefulness of identifying novel snps from transcriptome data. moreover,  <dig>   of  <dig>  snvs were located in exons of unigene clusters, and  <dig>   of the  <dig>  snvs caused amino acid changes. some of the transcripts are possibly related to the horses’ running ability. for example, titin  is related to the passive stiffness of muscle by limiting the range of motion of the sarcomere in tension
 <cit> , such that ttn affects the ability of muscle directly
 <cit> . other examples include obscurin , which is associated with ttn and ank <dig> genes
 <cit> , and the skeletal muscle calcium release channel gene  located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum
 <cit> , whose mutations caused several muscle-related diseases, including central core disease
 <cit> . the snv distribution profile of the ttn was specific to individual horses .

comparison of the expressed genes in blood and muscle tissues with other organisms
in muscle and blood tissues,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ucs were identified as expressed genes, respectively, showing that blood expressed about 40% more genes than muscle tissue . by comparison with two previous rna-seq studies conducted in human  and in mouse skeletal muscle tissue
 <cit> , we observed that the go classifications of all the expressed genes in the three organisms were similar to each other . the differences in go assignments between tissues  were larger than those of the same tissue among the three species .

identification and characterization of differentially expressed genes in blood and muscle tissues regulated by exercise
we calculated the expression level of all unigenes from the  <dig> samples. the distribution of  <dig>  ucs’ average expression levels in the  <dig> samples showed that half of the ucs were expressed at less than  <dig>  fpkm  and three-quarters of the ucs were expressed at less than  <dig>  fpkm . the correlation coefficients of the fpkm values among the samples were comparable to previous rna-seq studies
 <cit>  . by comparing before and after 30 minutes of exercise, we identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes , consisting of  <dig> up- and  <dig> downregulated ucs in blood and  <dig> up- and  <dig> downregulated ucs in muscle . while the overall number of all the differentially expressed ucs was much larger in muscle than in blood, the number of novel differentially expressed ucs was larger in blood  than in muscle  .

we examined  <dig> genes that are known to be associated with racing performance in horses
 <cit> . twelve of the  <dig> genes successfully mapped on the genome annotation were expressed in muscle and blood, and six were differentially expressed in muscle . the rest were detected in neither of the two tissues. the six genes upregulated by exercise were: hif1a, which encodes a transcription factor that responds to hypoxia; adrb <dig>  which is involved in the regulation of energy expenditure and lipid mobilization from adipose; ppard, which regulates expression of genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms; vegf, which is an important angiogenic factor recovering the oxygen supply to tissues when blood vessels are blocked; tnc, which is located in positive-selected regions for racing performance
 <cit> ; and bdnf, which is a candidate gene that may be associated with exercise behavior
 <cit> .

we also compared differentially expressed genes  in muscle tissue with the  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated degs that are associated with exercise training
 <cit>  . among these  <dig> degs, only five genes, actr3b, fbxo <dig>  per <dig>  c1orf <dig>  and gatm, were identified as degs in this study, among which c1orf <dig> and per <dig> showed a different expression profile.

sampling the transcriptomes immediately after exercise enabled the identification of differentially expressed early response genes that are rapidly induced by exercise. many early response proteins include transcriptional regulators, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases  and nf-κb, which promote fuel homeostasis and prevent skeletal muscle atrophy
 <cit> . in addition, important oxidative stress-sensitive enzymes that can be activated by nf-κb and mapks after exercise, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase 
 <cit> , were upregulated in horse muscle after exercise. among the  <dig>  degs from the two tissues, we identified  <dig> transcription factors, which might regulate downstream components of exercise-triggered signaling pathways . gata <dig>  which can interact with ap <dig> transcription factors to regulate mapk and nf-κb signaling
 <cit> , was underexpressed in blood, while creb <dig>  whose zinc-finger and bzip domain can specifically bind to the cre with c-jun or cre-bp1
 <cit> , was overexpressed in muscle. upregulation of creb <dig> might be explained by the fact that creb <dig> and c-jun genes are involved in calcium-dependent transcriptional pathways in skeletal muscle
 <cit> .

at least  <dig> uncharacterized transcription factors could be candidates for novel primary transcriptional regulators accompanying exercise. we validated the expression levels of seven randomly chosen transcription factors using quantitative rt-pcr from the remaining sample materials .

switching the expression pattern of alternative splicing forms of the gene before and after exercising
four genes  showed interesting rna expression patterns, in which two different alternative splicing forms of the same gene showed reversed expression patterns before and after exercising, similar to that of the sxl gene in drosophila
 <cit> . this observation suggested a cost-effective method of regulation: the cells do not have to produce completely new exons and proteins, but merely change the composition of the existing exons
 <cit> . the genes with reversed expression are: axl, dync <dig>  plekhg <dig>  and cobll <dig> . figure 
 <dig> shows cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain  protein 
 <cit>  as an example of the reversed expression pattern in muscle before and after exercising. 

CONCLUSIONS
we generated a large amount of horse transcriptome data. their analyses provided candidate genes that are related to horse racing performance: six previously identified exercise-associated genes and  <dig> early regulated transcription factors that are differentially expressed by exercise, three genes that display high snv density, and four alternatively expressed splicing variants. in addition, all  <dig>  differentially expressed genes could be important candidate genes for further research.
