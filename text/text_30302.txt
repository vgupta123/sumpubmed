BACKGROUND
soybean  is the second most valuable crop in the u.s., accounting for $12– <dig> billion in annual revenue . genomics has had a profound effect on plant biology, but the impact on major crop species such as soybean remains limited to a few marker characterized disease resistant germplasm releases  <cit> . a primary difficulty is that the soybean genome is 4– <dig> times larger than the model plants arabidopsis thaliana, medicago truncatulata or lotus japonicus. further, the soybean genome shows evidence of a paleopolyploid origin with gene-rich islands that were highly conserved following duplication  <cit> .

shultz et al.,  <cit>  used bac fingerprint derived contig clone density to estimate that 25–30% of the genome was highly conserved after both duplications, leading to 50–60% of the genome existing in a two- or four-copy state. that conclusion was supported by the gene number in gene families inferred from est hybridizations to bac minimum tile paths   <cit> . ultimately, shultz et al.,  <cit>  predicted the genome could be resolved into about four thousand segments  that differed in copy number per haploid genome. the regions appear interspersed at random, with no evidence for conserved neighbor relationships.

toward the end of developing a complete map describing where duplicated regions were located, contigs representing each of the genomic segments were rebuilt at high stringency and a minimum number of merges allowed  <cit> . despite the high stringency, homeologous regions coalesced to single contigs. consequently, each contig was measured for the number of bac clones per unique dna band. six clones per unique band in a clone fingerprint was expected, yet regions of  <dig> and  <dig> clones per unique band were common. since homeology could not be distinguished from over-representation of regions in the bac libraries, contigs were labeled to distinguish their expected copy number. the  <dig>  contigs in the  <dig> to  <dig>  series were expected to be largely single copy . the  <dig> contigs in the  <dig>  to  <dig>  series were predicted to be present in two copies and derive from the more recent tetraploidy event. therefore, with further analyses the  <dig>  series of contigs were each expected to be separated into two, resulting in  <dig> different regions  <cit> . the  <dig> contigs in the  <dig>  to  <dig>  series were predicted to be largely coalescences of  <dig> genomic regions derived from both the genome duplication and hybridization events that produced an octaploid-like genome . with further analyses, contigs containing clones from  <dig> genomic regions were expected to separate into  <dig>  different regions. in total,  <dig>  multi-copy regions and  <dig>  single-copy regions were expected.

dna markers that anchored the soybean physical map to the genetic map also showed evidence of variation in copy numbers derived from ancient ploidy shifts  <cit> . all rflp markers hybridized to clones in two or more contigs. even the majority  of microsatellite markers could generate amplicons from clones in two or more contigs. markers were labeled with an alphabetic suffix, with -a the smallest amplicons, or band, -b the next smallest . alignment of contigs with the genetic map using these anchors was error prone, requiring each marker anchored contig to be shown at each possible location.

to resolve the problem of genetic map placement, microsatellite markers derived from bac end sequences were used to align contigs with the genetic map  <cit> . here, only one outcome was expected, the placement of a single contig to a single location. maps generated with the markers did show single locations, often in gaps in the existing maps  <cit> . there were  <dig>  bes reads available from the physical map of the 'forrest' cultivar of soybean that provided about two thousand potential satellite markers. these markers should be enough to locate and orientate every contig at a single map location. these markers, however, cannot separate the polyploid-like regions that are composed of nearly identical homeologous bacs as markers in these regions produce multiple amplicons. new approaches are needed to map these regions correctly.

soygd, based on a distributed annotation systems  called the generic model organism databases   <cit> , was developed to show polyploid genomic regions to users . a track for duplications can be inserted into gbrowse  <cit> , however, for highly duplicated genomes, new classifications and ontology for representing large-scale genome duplications had to be developed  <cit> . exciting new tools that were developed to compare syntenic regions among genomes  <cit>  demonstrate that the gmod platform has the potential to display homeology.

the cultivars forrest and 'williams 82' provide a large set of useful genomic tools for soybean genomics  <cit> . the two cultivars can be thought models in the same way as are cultivars 'columbia' and 'landsberg erecta' to arabidopsis thaliana, or 'mo17' and 'b73' are to zea mays. the soybean community is committed to advancing both resources, with williams  <dig> as the lead for a complete genome sequence. in  <dig> there were  <dig>  million trace sequences at ncbi. some preliminary sequence contigs with annotations for about 90% of the genome were available. sequence contigs can be viewed on the genetic map at a new section of soygd  <cit> . these sequence resources represent tools for in silico biology that can resolve the physical map and de-convolute the complete genome sequence. here, these resources were tested for usefulness as tools to determine if the existing contig annotations truly reflect genomic regions that are polyploidy-like, to identify hsvs that can distinguish homeologs within cultivars and to identify hsvs that can distinguish among soybean cultivars.

RESULTS
genomic regions
a megablast of forrest bes  to williams  <dig> wgs showed some homeologous regions had diverged significantly and were essentially single-copy . for example, one of the pair of bes from b47p <dig>  showed only 90% identity between forrest and williams  <dig>  only one sequence read matched this bes in williams  <dig> trace files, with about  <dig> snps and  <dig> snis. that degree of divergence between cultivars had been reported in sequenced aflp bands  <cit> . at this degree of divergence though, the williams  <dig> sequences may represent a homeologous region. in that case the region being examined was not represented in the williams  <dig> wgs. under-representation may be due to cloning bias against some regions since the wgs is based on a single insertion site in a single high copy number vector.

a to calculate the percentage of the soybean genome covered by the clones  in our ecori-  and bamhi or hindiii insert libraries , the genome size of soybean was assumed to be  <dig>  mb.

examination of the second bes from b47p <dig>  showed three sequences with 99% identity between forrest and williams  <dig> . the differences represent probable snps between cultivars. however, in addition there were  <dig> sequences with >95% identity. those homeologous sequences could be clustered into  <dig> different groups based on snps among hsvs . contig  <dig> appears to be octaploid-like at one end and diploid-like at the other end. contigs of this type are dangerous to merge with neighboring contigs, as eight different regions might match, only one of which would be correct.

contig  <dig>  also from lg a <dig> , is a potentially octaploid-like contig. examination of the four bes from h53f <dig>  and h51d <dig>  showed evidence to support the octaploid-like nature of the contig. for example, at h53f <dig> there were three sequences with 99% identity between forrest and williams  <dig> . the differences among these three and the forrest bes may represent snis between cultivars . however, in addition there were  <dig> sequences with >90% identity. those clearly homeologous sequences could be clustered into  <dig> different groups based on h-snps.

at bes h51d <dig> , about  <dig> kbp away on lg a <dig> , the genomic region was less well represented among trace files. there were three sequences with 99% identity between forrest and williams  <dig> . the differences represent probable snis between cultivars . however, in addition there were 5– <dig> different sequences with >90% identity. those clearly homeologous sequences could be clustered into  <dig> different groups based on h-snps.

fourteen bac clones were chosen from contig  <dig> and used for pcr amplification of the bes. sequencing these amplicons revealed two sequences, each representing one of two homeologs mixed together throughout the contig . the a type and the g type were present but the t type and the c type found in wgs were not present. therefore, the third and fourth homeologs predicted to be in the contig by wgs to bes alignments could not be distinguished by the > <dig> bp of dna sequence. the g type and a type clones can each be used to form a new contig. the snhs will be used to split ctg <dig>  in two. map locations for the split contigs may be determined if cultivar differences can be found linked closely to the hsvs among common mapping population parents.

of further note, micro-satellite marker sat_ <dig> anchoring contig  <dig> was on the g-type clone iso56k <dig>  sat_ <dig> did not appear to have any close homeologs . therefore, the octaploid-like regions can be quite heterogeneous across contig-sized regions and suggests diploidization acts on regions less than the size of a bac clone.

a similar pattern was observed on lg g . examination of the pair of bes from h77p <dig>  in contig  <dig> shows that four genomic regions potentially coalesced and indicates the octaploid-like nature of the contig. for example, at bes soyfk12th there were three sequences with 99% identity between forrest and williams  <dig> . the differences represent probable snis between cultivars . in addition, there were  <dig> homeologous sequences with >95% identity which could be clustered into 4– <dig> different groups based on h-snps .

even the satellite marker satt <dig>  anchoring bac h77p <dig> to contig  <dig> and the genetic map showed evidence for conserved homeologs . there were four different hsv sequences with 99% identity. differences among homeologs were evident as  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  probable snps compared to the trace file - <dig>  none of the four genomic regions was adequately represented among the trace files, suggesting a cloning bias against each. an alternate hypothesis is that the sequence variations are errors in the reads of a single region, which is unlikely given the genomic context of the marker.

whole genome comparisions
because bac clones were selected from the mtp to generate bes, there are many fewer bes from polyploid-like regions than diploidized regions . nonetheless, there are sufficient numbers to examine the usefulness ploidy annotations found at soygd. allowing for 90% identity, the mean number of homeologs inferred from the bes to wgs matches was  <dig>  for octaploid-like contigs;  <dig>  for tetraploid-like contigs and  <dig>  for diploidized contigs. those means were in good agreement with those inferred from clones per unique band metric used to label contigs in the physical map as potentially repeated and octaploid-like  <cit> . at 95% identity there were about half as many matches on average, suggesting divergence following the most recent genome duplication has been less than after the first event. at  <dig> and 99% identity there was evidence for sequence pairs that share significant identity in the polyploid-like regions but not in the diploidized regions.

 megablast searches and snp analysis were used to identify the mean number of homeologous groups of sequences above three identity percentages. most bes from ctgs 1– <dig> showed matches to regions that were single copy, however a significant number of regions from contigs formed from  <dig> or  <dig> coalesced regions could be detected at  <dig>   <dig> and even 99% sequence identity.

a two hundred sequences were selected from these groups for visual scoring of the blast searches.

b the bac libraries were each constructed from dna derived from twenty five different seedlings of cultivar forrest, bulked after single pod selection at f2: <dig> from f2: <dig> to f2: <dig>  but otherwise inbred. therefore, less than 7% heterogeneity should have remained from 'dyer' and 'bragg' the parents of forrest.

genes and markers
bac end sequences anchored to a robust physical map are important tools for genome analysis. bes have been developed from mtp2bh, mtp4bh and mtpe <dig> . enquiries to genbank nr and pat databases identified  <dig>  potentially geneic homologs. analysis of the locations of the inferred genes showed evidence of gene rich islands on each chromosome .

eighty one homologs of dna markers found in genetic maps were detected in the bes, i.e. forty two bes's contained sequence highly homologous  to  <dig> different genetic markers , or about 4% of the markers with sequences in genbank. about three thousand new microsatellite markers were identified within the whole bes collection.

snps among the hsvs were found in nearly every bes examined. snis among the hsvs were found among 24% of sequences . clones in plates  <dig> and  <dig> were re-sequenced and so have  <dig> records for each bac end in genbank. re-sequenced clones help determine the sequence error rate and greatly facilitate snp detection. along with the few clones tested directly by mapping , about  <dig> % of snps and snis detected in single pass sequence are expected to be validated  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the comparison of forrest and williams  <dig> sequences represents a powerful tool for soybean geneticists. there are abundant snps and snis among the sequences, with many linked to predicted gene sequences . the high frequency of single nucleotide changes between genomic regions of soybean cultivars has been reported previously  <cit>  and stands in contrast to the very low frequency between ests  <cit> . clearly, further investment in genomic snp identification is called for. mtp bes  <cit>  make an excellent starting point, providing markers spaced at regular intervals in the genome.

in comparison to snis, indels larger than  <dig> bp are very rare. this bias against indels may explain why rflps and aflps are rare in soybean  <cit> . further the scarcity of indels will have contributed to the inability of fpc to separate bacs into different contigs, once their sequence identity exceeded 90%  <cit> . the use of snps and snis to characterize bacs will improve contig building methodology. for example, plate  <dig> of mtp4bh was developed from just  <dig> octaploid-like contigs by picking redundant clones from putatively octaploid-like contigs  <cit> . this set of  <dig> sequences should resolve into  <dig> regions when the genome sequence is properly de-convoluted.

bioinformatic and functional annotation of polyploid genomes can be greatly improved using a combination of bac fingerprint based physical maps, wgs sequence and hsv partitioning of bac clones in polyploid regions. the separation of contigs will allow the de-convolution of sequence and allow whole genome annotation in polyploids. preliminary results from stringent blat analysis of bes to sequence scaffolds can be viewed at soygd  <cit> 

major challenges will have to be overcome in assigning function to the duplicated regions. reverse genetic approaches like gene silencing and mutation would be expected to be effective only in certain small gene families and particular genomic regions. gene silencing should work when duplicated genes of redundant function are close enough in sequence to be inhibited by the same probe  <cit> . during over-expression  <cit> , the co-suppression response of the endogenous gene family will have to be considered. will co-suppression actually reduce the activity of the members of the gene family in patterns not predicted by the experimenters? in the case of the identification of mutations for loss of function by tilling  <cit> , the functions of the homeologous genes must have been sufficiently diverged over evolutionary time for success to be expected. secondly, no aneupleurotic pathways with functional redundancy must exist. the physical map should be used to guide these approaches. a complete map of homeologous regions can help identify genes in regions likely to be unique, single copy, and others likely to be redundant in  <dig> or  <dig> copies like an allo-polyploid.
