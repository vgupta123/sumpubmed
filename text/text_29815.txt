BACKGROUND
flax  is an annual, self-pollinated species with a genome size of ~  <dig> mb  <cit> . the species is believed to have originated in either the middle east or indian regions  <cit>  and spread throughout asia and europe, prior to its introduction into the new world  <cit> . divergent selection applied over thousands of years has resulted in fiber and linseed types which are the same species but differ considerably in morphology, anatomy, physiology and agronomic performance  <cit> . fiber flax cultivars are taller and less branched and are grown in the cool-temperate regions of china, the russian federation and western europe  <cit> . linseed cultivars are shorter, more branched, larger seeded and are grown over a wider area in continental climate regions of canada, india, china, the united states and argentina  <cit> . flax provides raw materials for food, medicine and textiles and, as such, it has been of great importance to human culture and development for more than  <dig>  years  <cit> . linseed oil is well-known for its health benefits mainly attributed to its high content of omega- <dig> alpha linolenic acid . linseed oil has been used for centuries in paints and varnishes because of its unique drying properties attributable to its distinctive fatty acid composition  <cit> . consumption of ground seeds adds nutritional benefits because flax seeds are also a rich source of lignans, compounds that have anticancer properties  <cit> . in the last decade, the fiber industry has devoted some effort to develop high-value products from linseed stems with applications in the pulp, technical fiber and biofuel industries  <cit> . therefore, understanding the genetic diversity of flax collections is important for the continued improvement of this crop as well as for its development into a truly dual purpose crop  <cit> .

initial diversity assessments in flax were carried out using morphological parameters  <cit>  and isozymes  <cit> . in recent years, molecular marker systems such as randomly amplified polymorphic dna , amplified fragment length polymorphism , inter-simple sequence repeat , simple sequence repeat  and inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism  have been used to measure genetic variation and relationships in cultivars and landraces of flax  <cit> . however, most of these previous studies assessed either few marker loci or few genotypes.

world gene banks store approximately  <dig>  accessions of flax germplasm  <cit> . in canada, a world collection of approximately  <dig>  accessions of cultivated flax is maintained by plant gene resources of canada . this collection has traditionally been deployed in flax breeding through a variety of conventional strategies  <cit> . in  <dig>  the total utilization flax genomics  project was initiated in canada to generate genomics resources for flax and to apply them to an array of traits for the ultimate purpose of flax improvement. the tufgen project has developed numerous genomics resources including molecular markers  <cit> , genetic maps  <cit> , a physical map and bacterial artificial chromosome end sequences  <cit> , expressed sequence tags  <cit>  and whole genome shotgun sequence  <cit> . to take advantage of these tools, a core collection of  <dig> flax accessions capturing the breadth of the phenotypic diversity of the pgrc collection was assembled.

quantitative trait loci  and association mapping  are complementary approaches for the identification of marker-trait association. the first utilizes biparental mapping populations to monitor the co-segregation of qtl and marker loci. the second utilizes germplasm collections to identify qtl-marker correlations based on ld  <cit> . qtl analysis has limited mapping resolution due to the accumulation of few meiosis events in a single cross, but it is not affected by population structure which can be a source of spurious association in am. conversely, am can achieve higher mapping resolution through high numbers of historical recombination events in germplasm collections. an ideal association panel should harbor the broadest genetic diversity because this is often correlated with a rapid ld decay necessary to resolve complex trait variation to a single gene or nucleotide  <cit> . null or weak population structure and a low level of relatedness among individuals of the germplasm collection are also desirable. thus, genetic diversity, population structure, familial relatedness and ld patterns need to be assessed prior to am analyses to fully exploit their advantages for flax genetic improvement.

in this study we genotyped  <dig> flax accessions using  <dig> microsatellite loci. the overall goal was to evaluate the usefulness of this flax core collection for am studies. our specific goals were:  to investigate the genetic diversity;  to estimate the levels of population structure and assess familial relatedness;  to detect the patterns of ld; and  to identify non-neutral genomic regions potentially underlying divergent selection between fiber and linseed types.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis
based on  <dig> neutral loci, the phylogenetic analysis using the nj algorithm partitioned the  <dig> accessions into two major groups and one admixed group . group  <dig>  was composed of  <dig> accessions that were further subdivided into three sub-groups representing accessions from south asia, western europe and south america. the south asian sub-group included mostly accessions from india, pakistan and afghanistan while the western european sub-group contained mostly accessions from france, portugal and germany but also from romania and turkey. the south american sub-group included accessions from argentina and uruguay. group  <dig>  had  <dig> accessions distributed into two sub-groups, namely north america and eastern europe. the north american sub-group clustered cultivars and breeding materials originating exclusively from canada and the u.s.a. however, not all north american accessions clustered within that sub-group. a few of these accessions were included in the eastern european sub-group which otherwise included mostly accessions from russia, ukraine, romania, poland and lithuania. this sub-group included 90% of the fiber flax accessions present in the core collection. within the eastern european sub-group, the geographic origin and industrial use overlapped, including fiber flax accessions from the netherlands, the former soviet union and the u.s.a. the admixed group , namely the north american/european group, had  <dig> accessions from the u.s.a., canada and european countries.

population structure
a total of  <dig> loci meeting the neutrality criteria, with ld <  <dig>  and distributed across the  <dig> linkage groups, were included in these analyses. similar to the phylogenetic analysis based on the nj algorithm, the pcoa revealed the presence of two major groups albeit with some admixture among sub-groups . coordinate  <dig> and  <dig> explained  <dig> % of the total genetic variation. the bayesian-based clustering approach implemented in structure also identified two groups according to the Δk approach . based on the estimated membership coefficient , the south asian, western european and south american sub-groups  could be clustered together within g <dig>  and the north american and eastern european sub-groups  could be similarly clustered within g <dig>  the north american/european sub-group  was mostly an admixture of the other two major groups. taken together, the nj, pcoa and structure analyses all agreed with respect to the distribution of the  <dig> flax accessions into two major groups. additionally, the nj and structure analyses agreed in partitioning the collection into six sub-groups, with few differences among sub-groups. the high proportion of shared alleles revealed by the pcoa and structure analyses was confirmed by the weak population structure as measured by the coefficient of population differentiation  between g <dig> and g <dig>  the level of differentiation between sub-groups ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   .

molecular coancestry
based on the alleles of the  <dig> microsatellites, the average molecular coancestry between any two flax accessions was  <dig>  in the core collection as a whole. approximately 70% of the pairwise coancenstry estimates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the intra sub-group molecular coancestry ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the pairwise molecular coancestry estimates ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . overall, more than 80% of the pairwise molecular coancestry estimates in the core collection and sub-groups ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively. the coancestry analysis indicated that most flax accessions had weak and moderate familial relatedness with the other accessions in the core collection and sub-groups respectively, which may be a reflection of the broad genetic diversity of the pgrc collection and the careful selection of accessions exercised while constructing the core collection.

genetic diversity
in the core collection, the  <dig> neutral microsatellites retained detected  <dig> alleles  , out of which  <dig>  had a maf <  <dig>  and were considered rare alleles . the total unbiased gene diversity  and the observed heterozygosity  were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. allelic richness  was estimated at  <dig> , the inbreeding coefficient  at  <dig>  and the pic value at  <dig> . the genetic diversity parameters were also estimated for the major groups and sub-groups . the parameters na, rs, ∏, ra and pic in g <dig> were superior to those in g <dig>  even though the population size of g <dig> was 25% smaller than g <dig>  the parameters ho and fis across the core collection, the major groups and sub-groups are consistent with the predominantly self-pollinated nature of the species.

linkage disequilibrium
to analyze ld variation, genetic distances for  <dig> microsatellites were available from the consensus linkage map of flax  <cit> . the average genome-wide distance between adjacent markers was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm. in the core collection, the average r <dig> values for linked and unlinked markers were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the 95th percentile of r <dig> distribution for unlinked markers was  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the loci pairs were in significant ld. the average genome-wide ld decayed to  <dig>  within  <dig>  cm . ld values within sub-groups and major groups are presented in table  <dig>  the average r <dig> values for linked and unlinked markers were higher in g <dig> than in g <dig> and the percentage of loci in significant ld was lower with  <dig> % in g <dig> versus  <dig> % in g <dig>  slower ld decay was observed within sub-groups , ranging from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , which could be attributed to the limited population size and narrow genetic diversity of some sub-groups as compared to the core collection. regardless of the data set, i.e., core collection or inferred groups, the average r <dig> for linked markers remained higher than for unlinked markers, supporting physical linkage as the main determinant of ld in this core collection. the relatively rapid ld decay within the core collection suggested that high marker saturation will be required for effective am. the slower ld decay within some of the sub-groups could be exploited for exploratory am or coarse mapping.

identification of non-neutral loci
the fiber and linseed groups made of the  <dig> fiber accessions of the core collection and a random subset of  <dig> linseed accessions were subjected to bottleneck analysis  <cit> . the mode-shift test showed the typical l-shaped distribution of allele frequencies in both groups , expected at mutation drift-equilibrium when rare alleles are numerous, thus suggesting absence of a recent bottleneck  <cit> . the sign test, however, indicated a heterozygosity excess  in the fiber group  but not in the linseed group . the population structure analysis showed a sharp peak of Δk at k =  <dig> largely corresponding to the fiber and linseed types . thus, no hierarchical population structure was detected and the two original groups  were adopted for posterior analyses. distortion from neutral expectations was detected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci with ew, ln rh, lositan and arlequin, respectively . a total of  <dig> loci  distributed across  <dig> linkage groups were significant in at least two of the four tests and were considered true outliers . ld between these and their adjacent loci ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  in the fiber group and from  <dig> to  <dig>  in the linseed group.

the physical to genetic distance between c306-s98_lu765bb and its closest locus c306-s98_lu <dig> was estimated at  <dig> kb/cm. considering an ld of  <dig> between them and a genetic distance estimate of  <dig>  cm, we investigated a physical interval of  <dig> kb. a total of  <dig> genes were predicted in this interval, of which  <dig> showed significant similarities with high quality annotations of the uniprotkb protein database . the physical to genetic distance between c16-s156_lu <dig> and c16-s156_lu <dig> was estimated at  <dig> kb/cm with a moderate ld . consequently, the hitchhiking effects may not extend across the total genetic distance of  <dig>  cm. we estimated the ld decay in both flax type groups to calculate an average genetic distance at which ld was strong . ld decayed to  <dig>  within ≈  <dig>  cm, equivalent to  <dig> kb in which only five highly similar genes were predicted. the number of predicted genes from different scaffolds with weak ld  having significant similarities to annotated proteins ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

go annotations could be assigned to ~60% of the predicted genes which are expressed in flax based on est and protein evidence. mapping of predicted proteins from  <dig> candidate genes to the uniprotkb database yielded  <dig>  go annotations as a result of multiple associations of individual proteins with multiple functions, processes or components  <cit>  . the top four go categories for molecular function were ‘binding’ , ‘catalytic activity’ , ‘nucleotide binding’  and ‘hydrolase activity’  . similarly, functional characterization of proteins associated with candidate genes at non-neutral loci indicated unknown broad ‘biological processes’ , followed by ‘cellular processes’ , ‘metabolic processes’  and ‘response to stress’  . the candidate gene products were localized to membrane  and intracellular locations  . approximately  <dig> % of the predicted proteins were localized to the cell wall. key genes associated with cell-wall biogenesis/modification, xylem identity, auxin regulation and fatty acid biosynthesis were identified among our candidate genes potentially affected by divergent selection in flax .

discussion
to contribute to long term sustainability of flax production and diversification, the germplasm stored in pgrc has comprehensively been characterized for morphologic, phenologic and agronomic characteristics  <cit> . this valuable phenotypic information enabled the construction of a flax core collection of  <dig> accessions to further flax genetic studies and improvement. here, we report on the genetic characterization of the core collection based on  <dig> microsatellite loci which represents one of the largest flax genetic studies published to date  <cit> .

genetic relationships and population structure
understanding the genetic relationships and structure of core collections is critical to control false positives in am  <cit> . the nj tree grouped the  <dig> flax accessions mainly but not exclusively according to geographical origin. the presence of accessions from countries out of the geographical clusters could be explained by the fact that the passport data may be occasionally weak where the donor country is considered the country of origin. as a consequence, the names of the sub-groups were assigned according to the geographic origin of the majority of the accessions within them.

the south asian sub-group of g <dig> was the most genetically distinct. fu  <cit>  reported similar results in  <dig>  flax accessions assessed with  <dig> rapd markers. however, in his study, the indian subcontinent and central asia were considered related groups rather than a unified cluster. differences in the marker systems and extent of the genome coverage  could explain the resolution differences between studies. the active exchanges of flax germplasm between france, germany, the united kingdom and hungary provide support for the western european grouping  <cit> . the genetic relationships among g <dig> accessions were also supported by a weak population differentiation among sub-groups . within g <dig>  the north american sub-group reflects historical germplasm exchange between the u.s.a. and canada  <cit> . the eastern european sub-group contained most of the fiber flax accessions from the netherlands and the former soviet union but it also included linseed accessions that were not intermixed. they were separated by a small group of u.s.a. accessions clustered within this sub-group. the u.s.a. accessions were mostly fiber type. similar results observed in the population structure analyses and the lowest fst  between sub-groups  could explain the interstitial presence of the u.s.a. accessions. the two major groups supported by our combined approach showed weak population subdivision in support of the breadth of the genetic diversity captured in this collection, making it ideal for am  <cit> .

molecular coancestry
strong population structure, familial relatedness, or both, may be significant in a core collection and would negatively impact am. yu et al.  <cit>  developed a mixed linear model  which incorporates the pairwise kinship  to correct for relatedness. spurious associations cannot be controlled completely by population structure   <cit> . models incorporating a k matrix are generally superior in controlling the rate of false positives while maintaining statistical power as compared to those using only a q matrix  <cit> .

in self-pollinated crops or inbred lines, coancestry estimates tend to be higher than in outcrossing species because the high hererozygosity reduces the probability that two alleles observed at a locus are identical by state  <cit> . in our core collection, approximately 80% of the pairwise coancestry estimates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , indicating that most of the lines had weak relatedness . we anticipate that with the weak population structure and relatedness of the core collection, a mlm correcting for k should provide sufficient statistical power to control most of the false positive associations in future am studies  <cit> .

genetic diversity
a suitable core collection for am should encompass as much phenotypic and molecular diversity as can be reliably measured in a given environment  <cit> . an average of  <dig>  alleles per locus over  <dig> microsatellites was observed in our core collection. this value is higher than the range previously reported   <cit> . this allelic diversity even exceeded that of a diverse sample of l. usitatissimum l. subsp. angustifolium  thell.,  and l. usitatissimum l. subsp. usitatissimum   <cit> . this high value may be the result of the number of genotypes analyzed , the choice of the germplasm, the number of microsatellite loci  and the microsatellite repeat type and length  <cit> .

a higher number of private alleles were observed in g <dig> as compared to g <dig> . the western european sub-group was particularly rich in private alleles with  <dig>  novel genetic variations, not previously sampled or utilized in modern flax breeding programs, may be present in this sub-group, offering unique alleles for broadening the diversity of flax gene pools. this is contrary to previous studies that have reported generally low genetic diversity of flax germplasm  <cit> . although 85% of the accessions of our core collection are cultivars and breeding materials, the collection possesses abundant genetic diversity, an advantageous attribute for dissecting the genetic basis of qtl for immediate application in flax breeding  <cit> .

linkage disequilibrium
low ld demands the use of dense marker sets resulting in tight linkage between markers and qtl, an advantageous criterion for breeding applications because the predictive ability of a marker will be robust through generations  <cit> . the average r <dig> of the entire core collection was  <dig>  and the average genome-wide ld decayed within  <dig>  cm . in self-pollinated species where recombination is less effective than in outcrossing species ld declines more slowly  <cit> . nonetheless, the germplasm that makes up the collection plays a key role in ld variation because the extent of ld is influenced by the level of genetic variation captured by the target population. for example, in wild barley , despite its high rate of self-fertilization , ld decayed within  <dig> kb, a value similar to that observed in maize, an outcrossing species  <cit> . the low ld of this core collection dictates the need for higher marker saturation to provide superior mapping resolution and qtl detection power by am  <cit>  as compared to using biparental linkage maps. alternatively, selection of sub-groups with low fst and higher but similar levels of ld would require a reduced number of individuals and markers for exploratory am.

the percentage of loci pairs in significant ld was fairly similar in each sub-group except for the north american and eastern european sub-groups which registered the highest values, possibly reflecting their more intensive artificial selection and narrow germplasm  <cit> . although our core collection did not behave as an unstructured large population, our combined analyses of population structure showed that g <dig> and g <dig> were weakly differentiated, representing two ancestral populations that minimize differences in ld and potentially the amount of spurious associations . thus, the results of our ld characterization within diverse genetic groups offer the versatility to perform cost-effective am studies in flax by providing the fundamental characterization of the collection demonstrating its usefulness for am.

identification of non-neutral loci
flax is one of the few domesticated plants that have been subjected to disruptive selection  <cit> . north america almost exclusively grows linseed and, up until recently, the stems were considered more problematic than beneficial because of their slow field biodegradation. however, the use of short fibers has received increased attention in north america in the last few years because of the interest in extracting value from the stem of linseed varieties  <cit> . stem fiber content does not seem associated with qualitative or quantitative plant characteristics in flax germplasm  <cit>  indicating that there are no major biological restrictions for pyramiding agronomic and seed quality traits with high fiber content.

crops have been subjected to strong selective pressure directed at genes controlling traits of agronomic importance during their domestication and subsequent episodes of selective breeding  <cit> . under positive selection, favourable alleles will increase in frequency until fixation. as an effect of genetic hitchhiking, loci closely linked to beneficial alleles might present distortions from neutral expectations. genome scans have allowed the identification of candidate loci involved in domestication and breeding traits in several crops  <cit>  and domesticated animals  <cit> . however, population structure and bottlenecks can mimic the effect of selection and create false positives. the combination of several methods based on different assumptions can reduce false positives  <cit> .

we applied four different tests of neutrality to identify the genomic regions that deviate from neutral expectations potentially associated with fiber and linseed divergent selection. collectively,  <dig> candidate genes were identified at nine loci . among our candidate genes, we found a β-tubulin involved in cell morphogenesis and elongation of fiber in cotton  <cit> , a glucan endo- <dig> -β-glucosidase associated with cell wall biogenesis/degradation in flax  <cit> , a chitinase involved in polysaccharide degradation  <cit> , a myb transcription factor that influences cellulose microfibril angle in eucalyptus  <cit>  and a class iii hd-zip protein  <dig>  involved in xylem identity in flax  <cit>  . candidate genes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> and fatty acid alpha-hydroxylase involved in fatty acid biosynthetic processes were also identified . however, β-galactosidase and cellulose synthase, two key enzymes for cell-wall modification and cellulose synthesis in flax  <cit>  were not present at any of the nine loci. previously identified genes in flax microarray analyses of hypocotyl and phloem fiber development  <cit>  and differentially expressed genes between flax inner and outer stem tissues  <cit>  were found among our candidate genes .

although preliminary, our scans provided the first insights of non-neutral loci potentially affected by divergent selection in flax. candidate genes, especially those previously reported  <cit> , will require further investigation and validation. to enhance the probability of identifying additional candidate loci, a high density of markers would be desirable. currently, next generation sequencing technology enables the re-sequencing of a large number of accessions at a reasonable price. thus, high quality and dense single nucleotide polymorphism  markers promise to provide comprehensive genome coverage for the identification of non-neutral genomic regions in flax  <cit> . such genomic tools for flax genetic studies are being developed and more comprehensive genomic scans will be possible in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, high levels of genetic diversity were revealed as compared to previous flax genetic studies. the weak population structure and relatedness and relatively fast ld decay indicate the suitability of this flax core collection for am. the peculiar divergent breeding applied in the development of fiber and linseed flax varieties provides a unique opportunity to understand how human needs have sculpted the flax genome during domestication and improvement, and how these divergent genomic regions could be deployed in breeding for flax as a dual purpose crop.
