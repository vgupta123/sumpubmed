BACKGROUND
newcastle disease  is one of the most contagious and devastating diseases to poultry in the world  <cit> . the causative agents are virulent strains of newcastle disease virus , which belong to the genus avulavirus, sub-family paramyxoviridae, family paramyxovirinae  <cit> . the viral rna genome is approximately 15 kb in length and encodes six major virus proteins: the nucleocapsid protein , phosphoprotein , matrix protein , fusion protein , hemagglutinin–neuraminidase  and large polymerase protein . in addition, the hn protein is an important multifunctional surface glycoprotein that consists of a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane region, a stalk region and a globular head, in which the receptor–binding site, the site responsible for neuraminidase activity and all of the antigenic sites reside  <cit> . it has been confirmed that there are seven overlapping antigenic sites in the hn protein, whereas residues  <dig> to  <dig> constitute the only linear epitope identified in the hn gene, which is susceptible to immune pressure to generate antigenic variation  <cit> . researchers have recently confirmed that the variation in the linear epitope in the hn protein would intensify the antigenic difference  <cit> . previously, seven neutralizing epitopes positioned at residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> of the f protein have been identified.

the strains of ndv can be divided into two distinct clades: class i and class ii, and based on the older classification system, both clades could be divided into  <dig> genotypes, and the class ii clade can be divided into fifteen genotypes when based on the new classification system, while the class i clade can be divided into three sub-genotypes. to date, a strict vaccination policy has been implemented in china and the vaccine strain lasota which belonged to genotype ii has been widely used in china for over 40 years. however, infections of genotype viid ndvs have still frequently occurred in china and other asian countries . meanwhile, there are also some virulent genotypes  circulating among avian species in china  <cit> .

to elucidate the circulation of virulent ndvs among chickens in eastern china,  <dig> virulent ndvs isolated from chicken flocks, including broilers and layers, from  <dig> to  <dig> were phylogenetically characterized.

RESULTS
isolation and identification of ndvs from clinical samples
fifty-five ndvs from clinical samples of different chicken flocks in eastern china were isolated from  <dig> to  <dig>  identified and plaque-purified, and the details of the ndv isolates are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> ndvs characterized in this study



phylogenetic analysis
the phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> ndvs based on the whole f gene sequences showed that all strains were clustered into sub-genotype viid and they could be divided into two separate groups, namely viid <dig>  and viid <dig> , as previously described   <cit> . all of the strains isolated in 2012– <dig> belonged to viid <dig>  and only three of the twenty one strains isolated in  <dig> belonged to viid <dig>  all of the ndv isolates possessed the virulent f protein cleavage site motif 112rrqkr/f <dig>  and over 70 %  of the isolates shared k78r variation on the f gene.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of  <dig> sub-genotype viid ndv strains based on the whole region of the f gene



additionally, a phylogenetic analysis was also performed based on the whole hn gene . as determined from the phylogenetic tree based on the hn gene, all of the ndv isolates showed a distribution similar to that obtained from the tree based on the f genes: three in viid <dig> and  <dig> in viid <dig>  three residues, namely t <dig>  a <dig> and t <dig>  were unique for viid <dig>  whereas i <dig>  e <dig> and m <dig> were characteristic residues of viid <dig>  all of the ndv isolates shared  <dig>  % to 100 % nucleotide identity and  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % amino acid identity. only two isolates  shared the e347g variation. more than  <dig>  % of the isolates in  <dig>  exhibited the e347k variation in hn, whereas  <dig>  %  of those isolated in  <dig> possessed this variation. the latter percentage is nearly two-fold higher than that found in  <dig>  and 100 %  of the strains isolated in  <dig> possessed this variation. in addition, the layer-origin stains isolated in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> shared 67 % , 75 %  and 100 %  of the e347k variation in the hn gene, respectively. furthermore, we found that all of the strains harboring 347 k on hn also shared a g362a mutation. however, the role of this mutation has not been well elucidated. the  <dig> cysteine residues were conserved as described previously, and with the exception of the loss of a glycosylation site at  <dig> of js-02- <dig>  all of the other ndvs possessed six well-identified glycosylation sites.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of  <dig> sub-genotype viid ndv strains based on the complete hn gene

discussion
the genotype vii ndvs have become the most prevalent strains in china since the 1990s, and the sub-genotype viid ndvs are mainly responsible for the present nd epizootic in china  <cit> . in this study, virulent ndvs from the vaccinated chicken flocks were characterized as sub-genotype viid and could be clustered into sub-genotype viid <dig> and viid <dig> based on the phylogenetic trees based on both f and hn genes  <cit> . t <dig>  a <dig>  and t <dig> of the hn gene were unique residue substitutions found in the viid <dig> ndvs, and i <dig>  e <dig>  and m <dig> of the hn gene were characteristic residues of the viid <dig> ndvs. in this study, we found that sub-genotype viid <dig> remains the predominant genotype vii ndvs from  <dig> to  <dig>  and all of the ndvs isolated from  <dig> to  <dig> were located in this clade.

the hn protein of ndv plays an important role in immune protection against virus infection, and the variation of the antigenic epitope would expand the antigenic difference. and analysis of the role of site  <dig> in antigenicity has confirmed that the e347k variation would intensify the antigenic difference and may increase the risk of vaccine breakdown  <cit> . the isolation rate of strains with the e347k variation is increasing yearly, as previous reported. more than 36 % of the virus strains  were isolated in commercial layer flocks, which have resulted in losses in egg production. cho et al.  <cit>  found that the korean variation strains have also caused losses in egg production. moreover, more than 75 %  of the ndv strains isolated from layer flocks were the e347k-variation strains. the high isolation rate indicates that the e347k-variation strains can infect chickens under immune pressure because the layers were all well-vaccinated in china. both site  <dig> and site  <dig> locate around the receptor-binding pocket, and we found of e347k, g362a co-variant strains, whereas cho et al. also identified two strains with the e347k and g362r co-variant ones. however, the role of the co-variation remains unknown  <cit> .

at present, lasota is widely and frequently used to prevent ndv infection in the poultry industries in china; however, virulent ndv infections continue to occur in the well-vaccinated chicken flocks  <cit> . moreover, both cross hi and cross-neutralization tests were performed, and the r values of all of the strains were lower than  <dig> . however, the r values between the e347k-variant strains and lasota were lower than that found for the 347e/g strains, which indicate that the e347k variation would expand the antigenic difference with the vaccine strain. therefore, the results of the cross-neutralization and cross hi experiments may also be consistent with the higher isolation rate of the e347k-variant strains, which demonstrated significant antigenic differences between the vaccine strain and the predominant variant strains should be responsible for the outbreaks of nd in china.

in addition, the protection efficiency of lasota against the e347k variation strains in china is not well-elucidated. in this study, the vaccinated spf chickens were fully protected against morbidity and mortality, but virus shedding was not stopped. our data suggest that the lasota inactivated vaccine cannot protect chickens from virus shedding when infected with the variant ndvs, and the variant strain challenged group showed higher virus isoation rate which may be one of the reasons for the circulation of sub-genotype viid variation strains in vaccinated chicken flocks.

in conclusion, our findings indicate that the sub-genotype viid ndvs with e347k variation in the hn protein are predominant in eastern china and that this variation would intensify the antigenic difference with the vaccine strains. moreover, the vaccine strain lasota has been used for more than 40 years and can hardly protect chickens effectively from virus shedding when infected with the circulation strains. therefore, new ndv vaccines closely related to the prevalent genotype viid viruses should be developed to control nd in china.

CONCLUSIONS
currently, sub-genotype viid ndvs are the prevalent virulent strains circulating among vaccinated chicken flocks in eastern china. our findings indicate that the e347k variation in hn protein would expand the antigenic difference with lasota, which may be responsible for the increasing isolation rate of these strains from vaccinated chickens.
