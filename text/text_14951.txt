BACKGROUND
knowledge has increased concerning the fact that a plant does not act as an individual on its own, but as an actor in a vast stage populated by bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms  <cit> . arbuscular mycorrhizal  fungi represent one of the most important components of the complex root-plant microbiome, since they are present in about 80% of vascular plants. they supply the plant with phosphate, nitrogen, mineral salts and water, and they guarantee a more extensive protection from biotic and abiotic stresses at both local and systemic level. on the other hand, the plant allows the fungus to access the photosynthetic carbon-compounds  <cit> .

a partly known chemical dialogue guides this close relationship: plant strigolactones trigger the growth and branching of spore-germinating mycelium, while fungal signals, including lipochitooligosaccharides, stimulate root growth and branching  <cit> . the latter are recognized by a yet unknown receptor that causes a well conserved signal cascade and induces ca2+ oscillations within the nuclei, in a similar way to the mechanisms involved in rhizobium-legume symbiosis  <cit> . once they have penetrated the epidermis, am hyphae rapidly develop into plant cortical cells and form a tree-shape structure called arbuscule, which is the functional site of nutrient exchange. its formation is a non-synchronous process and its life-span is assumed to last no more than  <dig> days  <cit> . the arbuscule accommodation process requires a substantial remodelling of the cortical cell: all the thin arbuscule branches are enveloped by a periarbuscular membrane , which does not simply surround the arbuscule as a whole, but closely follows the surface of each branch, moulding to the arbuscule itself. pam development marks the appearance of the symbiotic interface, the narrow intracellular compartment that allows am fungi to grow inside the plant cell without breaking its integrity. cell biology investigations have recently demonstrated that pam biogenesis requires the proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, trans-golgi network and secretory vesicles  <cit> , while the insertion of specific pam proteins, such as mtpt <dig>  occurs thanks to polarized secretion processes  <cit> .

all these dramatic events are pointed out by the high number of genes that are regulated, not only in the whole mycorrhizal roots , but more specifically within the arbusculated cells  <cit> . in this framework, hogekamp and coworkers have shown that two of the most upregulated membrane transporter genes of medicago truncatula cells hosting am arbuscules are aquaporins. this specific gene regulation has also been confirmed by various other reports in different mycorrhizal plants  <cit> .

aquaporins  are well known for their ability to transport water, as well as other small solutes , across the membranes of various organisms, and genetic defects involving aquaporin genes have been associated with several human diseases  <cit> . plant aqps are present in various tissues and play a role not just in transport, but also in cell differentiation, cell enlargement, leaf function, nutrient transport and metal toxicity  <cit> . a new database is now available to make enquiries on possible functions through a comparison of sequences and structures  <cit> .

aqps are a family of small pore-forming integral membrane proteins. the molecular basis of their selectivity mainly depends on two filters within the pore: the first is formed by the conserved dual “npa” filters , while the second is formed by a constriction region that is also called the ar/r  filter  <cit> . it appears that the properties of the four residues that make up the ar/r selectivity filter control the substrate specificity of the pore  <cit> , and are thought to be useful for predicting the function of the protein  <cit> . on the basis of sequence comparisons, the aqps of dicots and monocots can be divided into five conserved subgroups, and some of these subgroups appear to be consistently linked to specific subcellular localizations, hence their names: plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , tonoplast intrinsic proteins , nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins , small and basic intrinsic proteins  and x intrinsic proteins   <cit> . the overall level of nip expression in plants is lower than the expression of other aqps, as they are usually associated with specialized organs and cells, and are involved in the exchange of metabolites between the host and the bacterial symbiont  <cit> . among the so far characterized nips, atnip2; <dig> specifically accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum of roots, whereas atnip5; <dig> is a plasma membrane mip mainly expressed in root elongation zones  <cit> . xip proteins instead have only been partially characterized, but it seems that they may have various expression patterns and functional characteristics.

although mycorrhizas have been demonstrated to be crucial for the hydraulic properties of plant roots, as they enhance the tolerance of the host plants to water deficit  <cit> , the involvement of aqps in am symbiosis is still unclear and under debate  <cit> . it is not known whether the beneficial water status of am plants is enhanced by the regulation of root aquaporins or because of an enhanced water flow.

with the final aim of shedding light on the potential role of this gene family which seems to be highly am-responsive, we have focused our research on two aqps that were found to be upregulated in lotus mycorrhizal roots  <cit> , and which belong to the nip and xip classes. by means of a combination of different experimental approaches , we have demonstrated that the two aqps are genetically and functionally diverse, although they are both am-responsive. ljxip <dig> is exclusively overexpressed in mycorrhizal roots, while ljnip <dig> is also rhizobium responsive. ljnip <dig> is solely present in am roots and, more precisely, in arbusculated cells, where the protein is associated with the complex endomembrane system. unlike a phylogenetically similar protein  <cit> , ljnip <dig> is involved in water, but apparently not ammonia, transport. these results open new questions on the functional role of am-responsive aqps and their relationship with arbuscules as the main fungal colonization structures.

RESULTS
gene isolation and phylogenetic analysis of ljnip <dig> and ljxip1
the 798-bp full-length cdna of the ljnip <dig> gene  and the 900-bp full-length cdna of the ljxip <dig> gene , obtained using a 5′ and 3′ race, encode respectively a  <dig> and a 299- amino-acid-long peptide. ljnip <dig> has two conserved npa filters, whereas ljxip <dig> shows an atypical amino-terminal npa . if a transmembrane prediction software  is used, both aquaporin proteins are likely to have  <dig> full transmembrane domains, thus confirming the standard structure of this family . the phylogenetic analysis  grouped them into two different functional sub-families. the highest homology of ljnip <dig> was found with mtnip1- <dig>  previously called mtnip <dig>  which has already been partially described by uehlein et al. <cit>  to be involved in ammonia transfer, while ljxip <dig> showed significant similarities with different proteins belonging to the xip family, a recently discovered family of unknown functions  <cit> .


am symbiosis and the cell pattern of ljnip <dig> and ljxip <dig> expression
in a previous microarray study  <cit> , the sequences identified as ljnip <dig> and ljxip <dig> resulted to be among the most upregulated genes with log <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, upon mycorrhization. in order to validate the specificity of such up-regulations, their expression patterns were investigated by comparing them with those of nodulated roots and respective controls, with high and low n and p availability. mycorrhizal and control roots were sampled at  <dig> days, this time being considered the point at which there were the most arbuscules in the microarray experiment  <cit> . control and nodulated roots were sampled at  <dig> dpi. from  <dig> to  <dig> nodules were counted in each inoculated root.

quantitative rt-pcr confirmed that the highest expression levels were reached in mycorrhizal roots. ljnip <dig> expression was also highly induced by nodulation , whereas ljxip <dig> expression was only slightly induced. gene expression was not activated in the non-inoculated plants that were maintained at different n and p levels.


these results demonstrate that the expression of the two putative aquaporins depends on the presence of the root symbiont, but is probably not significantly influenced by an improved n and p status of either mycorrhizal or nodulated roots. in addition, the expression of ljnip <dig> and ljxip <dig> is related to the identity of the symbiotic microbe or the specific plant-microbe interaction.

cell-specific expression of lotus aquaporins
a laser microdissection approach was used to localize the transcript accumulation sites. since the key structure of the nutrient exchange that takes place between plant and fungus has been demonstrated to be the arbuscule  <cit> , cortical cells were chosen as a first target. three cell types were collected by means of a laser microdissection system: arbusculated cells , non-colonized cortical cells from mycorrhizal roots , and cortical cells from non-mycorrhizal roots . when specific primers for ljnip <dig> and for ljxip <dig> were used, fragments of the expected size were present with different expression patterns: ljnip <dig> resulted to be specifically expressed in arbuscule-containing cells, whereas ljxip <dig> transcripts were present in all three cell types analyzed . in order to better investigate this result, a further relative quantification of ljxip <dig> transcripts was performed through one-step qrt-pcr on rna extracted from microdissected cells . this approach revealed that the gene was overexpressed in arbusculated cells in a significant way compared to the other cell types analyzed, thus confirming a possible additional or enhanced role within the arbuscule-containing cells. the validity of this result can be pointed out by the fact that rna was not amplified before the quantification, and that the exact amount of rna was preserved in each cell type.


ljnip <dig> expression over colonization time
since ljnip <dig> expression resulted to be more closely connected to the presence of the arbuscules, we followed the gene expression during a time course experiment. a comparison with the ljpt <dig> expression levels was also performed to gather information on the relationship between ljnip <dig> expression and arbuscule development. ljpt <dig> is the homologous of mtpt <dig>  which is considered a marker of active arbusculated cells in medicago, since its expression mirrors the arbuscule status, i.e. its expression decreases when the arbuscule collapses  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that the ljnip <dig> expression pattern mostly mimics ljpt <dig> dynamics. the expression levels increase for both genes until  <dig> dpi, but interestingly, important differences were detectable in the expression at  <dig> and  <dig> days post inoculation: ljpt <dig> expression started to decrease, probably due to the asynchronous process of the formation and collapse of the arbuscules, while ljnip <dig> expression did not show any significant difference between the two time points, and maintained high levels throughout the experiment. this allows us to speculate on the possibility of a role of this protein that is independent of the arbuscule status, being expressed both during arbuscule full functioning and senescence.


heterologous complementation of yeast mutants defective in ammonium or urea uptake
because of the high similarity of ljnip <dig> and mtnip1- <dig> <cit> , which is capable of transporting ammonium, we tested the capacities of both lotus aquaporins to transport ammonium. yeast  strain 31019b, which is defective in all three endogenous ammonium transporters , and is thus unable to grow on a medium containing < <dig> mm ammonium as the sole n source  <cit> , was used. this strain was transformed with yeast vector pdr <dig>  which expressed ljnip <dig> and ljxip <dig> under the control of the constitutive yeast pma <dig> promoter. in order to compare the transformed yeasts with the already described plant ammonium transporters and ammonia channels, this yeast strain was also transformed with pdr <dig> expression vectors containing the following coding sequences: the nh4+ transporter atamt1; <dig> <cit>  and k <dig>  a mutant aquaporin capable of transporting ammonia, in addition to urea  <cit> . the mutant k <dig> was derived from the water-selective atpip2; <dig> and was mutated in the selectivity filter to have a typical ar/r region of atnip1s. considering the acidic conditions of the periarbuscular space  <cit> , yeast growth was analyzed on a yeast nitrogen base  medium under different ph conditions. as shown in figure 5a, yeast growth was not restored by ljnip <dig> or by ljxip <dig> on the minimal medium containing  <dig> mm ammonium. as expected yeasts expressing atamt1; <dig> grew well at any ph and yeasts expressing k <dig> allowed a good complementation at ph  <dig> . we performed the same experiment with yeast strain ynvw <dig>  which is defective in its urea transporter and is thus unable to grow on a medium containing < <dig> mm urea as the sole n source  <cit> . as shown in figure 5b, yeast growth was not restored by either ljnip <dig> or by ljxip <dig> on the minimal medium containing  <dig> mm urea as the sole n source but just by the positive control k <dig> 


ljnip <dig> can transport water
in order to better characterize the ljnip <dig> and ljxip <dig> functions, the respective proteins were expressed in yeast protoplasts and the cells were examined, to assess their water transport capability, by means of a stopped-flow spectrophotometer  <cit> . this instrument allows measuring scattered light differences over time, which are correlated with the capacity of protoplasts to acquire water, in a rapid mixing device. the analysis of k <dig>  as previously mentioned, served as an internal control. the experiment revealed that ljnip <dig> increased the water permeability of the membrane, whereas the ljxip <dig> aquaporin did not increase the water transport rates of the yeast cells subjected to hyperosmotic conditions .


these results lead to the conclusion that ljnip <dig> may be involved in water transport, rather than in nitrogen solute transport. ljxip <dig>  however, was non-functional in all the assays. whether this reflects poor localization into the plasma membrane, selectivity or a lack of an opening stimulus remains an open question.

subcellular localization of ljnip <dig> in tobacco leaf epidermal cells
a chimeric ljnip1-egfp was constructed and placed downstream of the camv 35s promoter in order to gain insight into the subcellular localization of ljnip <dig> in plant cells. transient expression analyses were performed on epidermal cells from tobacco leaves. the fluorescence in the control cells, expressing free egfp, was uniformly extended into the cell, including the whole nucleus and the cell wall . figure 7d shows tobacco cells leaves that express the ljnip1-egfp protein: a light fluorescence signal was found in the nuclear envelope surrounding the cell nucleus, a typical signal of the endoplasmic reticulum region, and the inner membrane system.


egfp-ljnip <dig> accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the inner membrane system of lotus mycorrhizal roots
in order to validate the intracellular localization of the ljnip <dig> protein suggested by the aforementioned experiment on tobacco leaves, we generated lotus transgenic roots that expressed the egfp-ljnip <dig> fusion protein under the control of the ljnip <dig> endogenous promoter. lotus roots were transformed with agrobacterium rhizogenes carrying the plasmid. the roots were inoculated with 10– <dig> gi. margarita spores, and a minimum of ten independent transformed root lines were observed after 35– <dig> dpi. the transformed roots were identified through the expression of the dsred protein under the control of the ubiquitin promoter. the gfp signal was only detected in cells harboring arbuscules , and the signal was evident in the membranes surrounding the nuclei, which are usually coincident with the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as in the inner cellular membranes, also likely including the vacuolar tonoplast. however, a possible signal from the periarbuscular membrane cannot be excluded, even if the fluorescent signal did not accurately follow all the arbuscule branches. no gfp fluorescence was observed in the epidermal and cortical tissues of non-colonized roots, as also confirmed at higher magnification where the nucleus occupies a peripheral position inside the cortical cells .


discussion
when am fungi colonize their host’s roots, a significant cell reorganization as well as important changes in the transcriptomic profiles are usually reported  <cit> . these cellular and molecular changes are particularly impressive in arbusculated cells, which are considered to be at the heart of the symbiosis. since aquaporins - the water-channel proteins that allow the passage of water molecules through cell membranes - have often been reported to be upregulated in mycorrhizal roots, we characterized two lotus genes, ljxip <dig> and ljnip <dig>  which resulted to be regulated during a microarray experiment  <cit> . the results demonstrate that the two genes encode aquaporins that are genetically and functionally diverse, even though both are overexpressed during am symbiosis.

mycorrhiza-induced ljxip <dig> and ljnip <dig> belong to two different families of plant aquaporins containing different ar/r constriction regions
the name of the nip protein family comes from the archetype nodulin <dig>  which was initially characterized in soybean colonized by rhizobacteria  <cit> . the role of nodulin <dig> has been reported to be that of mediating the passage of water through the interface between the two symbionts. this group of integral membrane proteins is unique to plants and dates back to the first development phase of primitive land plants, suggesting a stable role during their evolution  <cit> . nips are widely distributed in both leguminous and non-leguminous plants, and  <dig> and  <dig> nip genes are encoded by the arabidopsis and rice genomes, respectively  <cit> . among plant aquaporins, proteins belonging to this subfamily have nonpareil functional features  <cit> . the nips have been divided into three groups on the basis of their selectivity filter structure. ljnip <dig> belongs to class i, and shows great similarities with the homologous medicago gene, which resulted to be overexpressed in mycorrhizal roots and is able to transfer ammonium or ammonia  <cit> .

the function of xip proteins, at a cellular level, has yet to be elucidated, but some of their features have been characterized: in  <dig>  bienert and coworkers  <cit>  showed that solanaceae xips are able to transfer several uncharged solutes, such as urea, glycerol, and boric acid, but resulted to be non-permeable to water. they also speculated on a possible functional overlap between xips and nips because of their similarity in the substrate spectrum and in the selectivity pore. conversely, xips from poplar resulted to have a wide and diverse expression pattern and to differ in their capability to transfer water  <cit> . ljxip <dig> shows great similarity with an uncharacterized aquaporin from ricinus communis.

the four aminoacids that form the ar/r constriction region are crucial for aquaporin substrate selectivity. as far as ljnip <dig> is concerned, the selectivity filter is made up of tryptophan, isoleucine, alanine, and arginine. these residues form a wide, rather hydrophobic pore, and are typical of class i nip proteins, which are characteristically able to transfer water  <cit> , consistently with our functional assays . on the other hand, the ljxip1’s ar/r selective pore is unusual, as it consists of a phenylanine, an arginine and two valines  , making it difficult to speculate on any possible compound affinities. however, it does show some similarities with typical nip protein belonging to class iii  <cit>  and, intuitively, with other xip proteins  <cit> .

it has recently been reported that aquaporins from ectomycorrhizal fungi could play a role in the interaction with plants  <cit> . as expected, the aquaporins so far characterized in symbiotic fungi belong to a distant branch, compared to plant aquaporins , which demonstrated a different evolutionary story.

in conclusion sequence analysis clearly shows that ljnip <dig> and ljxip <dig> belong to two diverse groups of plant aquaporins and the aminoacidic composition of the constriction region predicts different substrates, as confirmed by our functional experiments .

mycorrhiza-induced ljnip <dig> is specific of arbusculated cells and targets the inner membrane system
since aquaporins have already been detected as being expressed during nodule symbiosis  <cit> , we wanted to understand whether ljxip <dig> and ljnip <dig> were also rhizobium-responsive and whether their expression depended on p and n availability. neither the ljxip <dig> nor the ljnip <dig> expression levels resulted to be influenced by the soil nutrient concentration, but, interestingly, they were both overexpressed during interaction with microorganisms: ljxip <dig> resulted to be elicited above all by am fungi, whereas ljnip <dig> was also regulated by rhizobial bacteria. this clearly shows that the expression of the two aquaporins is related to the identity of the symbiotic microbe. transcript localization and relative quantification, through laser microdissection experiments in l. japonicus mycorrhizal roots, have shown that ljxip <dig> is expressed in different root cell-types, with higher expression levels in arbusculated cells but also constitutive levels in non-colonized cortical cells. ljnip <dig> is instead exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells, which raises the question of whether such close cell-type dependence is maintained in bacteroid-containing cells.

looking at experiments in which a laser microdissection approach was adopted  <cit> , it can be concluded that the data pertaining to aquaporin expression patterns are extremely consistent, regardless of the plant-fungus association, suggesting that they could be considered good novel indicators of am symbiosis and, in the case of ljnip <dig>  of root symbiosis.

current knowledge indicates that am-responsive phosphate transporters are excellent markers of am functionality  <cit> . therefore, we performed a ljpt <dig> expression time course  <cit> , and detected an overlapping pattern with ljnip <dig> until  <dig> dpi. interestingly, the correlation pattern was lost after this time, the aquaporin gene expression having remained high while ljpt <dig> started to decrease. this indicated the moment at which arbuscules started to collapse in our experimental conditions  <cit> . in fact, mycorrhizal specific phosphate transporters have not been reported to be expressed in collapsed arbuscules  <cit> .

the transient expression of ljnip <dig>  linked to the green fluorescent protein in nicotiana epidermal cells and in mycorrhizal lotus roots, showed a localization in the endomembranes. the protein is surely associated with the nuclear membranes, a typical characteristic of the er, but it also seemed to be dispersed in other endomembranes that could be the prosecutions of the er  or the tonoplast, which proliferates in the colonized cells surrounding the arbuscule branches  <cit>  and - as shown under the transmission electron microscope  <cit>  – may adhere to the periarbuscular membrane at some points . a homologous aquaporin, atnip2; <dig>  has been proposed to be involved in active cell elongation in the root elongating zone, where several kinds of organelles and the cell wall components are actively synthesized through the er  <cit> : the same high physiological and morphological activity is surely necessary for the dramatic changes that take place in mycorrhizal cells.


in conclusion, we suggest that ljnip <dig> is not exclusively localized in the periarbuscular membrane, like other proteins involved in nutrient uptake  <cit> , but could be associated with other cell membranes, such as the tonoplast, the er or er-related membranes.

ljnip <dig> and ljxip <dig> cannot transport ammonium or urea, but ljnip <dig> can transport water
on the basis of the high sequence similarity of ljnip <dig> and mtnip1- <dig>  which is capable of transferring ammonium, but not water  <cit> , we verified whether ljnip <dig> had the same characteristics, but obtained opposite results. in fact, while ljnip <dig> was permeable to water, as shown by stopped-flow experiments, it was not capable of efficiently transferring ammonium or urea in yeast complementation assays. on the other hand, ljxip <dig>  like any solanaceous protein from the same family, was not capable of transferring water  <cit>  or other solutes.

these results have paved the way for various speculations, considering that ljnip <dig> resulted to be highly expressed from  <dig> dpi  onwards. in fact, unlike previous descriptions, where the central vacuole was described as fragmented due to the presence of the fungus  <cit> , it is now known, on the basis of electron microscopy and confocal observations, that the tonoplast follows the periarbuscular membrane, leading on one hand to an increase in the surface of the tonoplast during the arbuscule development and, on the other, to an intimate interaction between the two cell membranes  <cit>  . we have speculated that ljnip <dig> is involved in the maintenance of plant cell turgor via water passage within the inner membrane systems, or is directly involved in the passage of water from the fungus to the plant, a mechanism that is currently poorly understood  <cit> . such a role is crucial when the arbuscular branches are active, as well as when they collapse and a higher quantity of water enters the vacuole to maintain the correct turgor. since an important membrane biogenesis occurs in cortical cells before, during and after the colonization by the fungus  <cit> , ljnip <dig> could mediate the passage of water inside and outside the membrane of the different organelles. in conclusion we can assume that ljnip <dig> functions as a water channel in the different membrane systems of the arbusculated cells.

CONCLUSIONS
taken as a whole, our findings reveal that two aquaporin-related genes belong to two distant families and respond differently to root symbioses, displaying a non-overlapping expression pattern. the potential role of ljxip <dig> remains rather obscure, although its exclusive response to am fungal colonization, and not to n-fixing rhizobial bacteria, makes it a good candidate for further investigations. the arbuscule-specific ljnip <dig> has instead proved to be a novel am symbiosis marker for the entire arbuscule life cycle. due to the not-synchronous nature of am colonization, ljnip <dig> seems to be a more versatile marker than ljpt <dig>  as it covers a wider range of arbuscule development steps. the functional experiments have conclusively demonstrated that ljnip <dig> does not transport ammonium, but can transfer water, unlike its medicago homologous  <cit> . on the basis of these functional results, of membrane localization and of expression timing, it is tempting to assume that the protein is potentially involved, directly or indirectly, in cell turgor regulation, in facilitating colonized cell adaptation to osmotic stresses, and/or in the actual transfer of water from the fungus to the plant.
