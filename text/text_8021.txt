BACKGROUND
atherosclerosis is a chronic disease characterized by endothelial dysfunction and inflammation . in addition to the significant monetary burden, atherosclerotic vascular disease undermines functional capacity, leads to a greater dependence on hospitalizations and long-term care, and is a risk factor for the development of myocardial infarction and heart failure  <cit> . a greater understanding of mechanisms and mediators of vascular dysfunction and inflammatory processes in the aortic vasculature that manifest as atherosclerotic disease are needed in order to promote the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies.

clinical studies have shown that atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic arch and innominate arteries is commonly observed in patients at risk for stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral artery disease and that plaque in the aorta is an indication of generalized atherosclerosis  <cit> . while retention of lipoprotein into the sub-endothelial vascular layer is believed to be the initiating stimulus leading to the development of atherosclerosis, activation of multiple pathways related to vascular inflammation and dysfunction sustain the process by stimulating recruitment of leukocytes and immune cells into the sub-endothelial layer  <cit> . differentiation of monocytes into tissue resident macrophages that engulf and oxidize lipids to become inflammatory foam cells is also a hallmark of atherosclerosis  <cit> .

one of the well-defined risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis is diet-induced obesity, which is on the rise in western societies  <cit> . mounting evidence in humans supports an etiological role for the microbiota in inflammatory atherosclerosis. recent studies have established that common chronic infections may account for up to 40% of newly developed atherosclerosis independent of genetic risk factors  <cit> . the gram-negative bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis  and chlamydia pneumoniae , have been associated with the development and acceleration of plaque burden in humans and these observations have been validated in animal models . both of these pathogens have a high prevalence of infection in the general population. p. gingivalis is an oral pathogen strongly associated with periodontal disease, one of the most common chronic diseases with a prevalence between 10-60% of adults  <cit> . p. gingivalis promotes chronic systemic inflammation by disrupting host immune responses and altering the composition of microbial communities 
. c. pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium that infects the respiratory tract and is a major cause of pneumonia in humans. an estimated 2- <dig> million cases of pneumonia each year in the united states are attributed to c. pneumoniae infection  <cit> . approximately 50% of adults have evidence of past infections by age  <dig> and re-infection throughout life is common  <cit> .

although extensive research has shown endogenous mediators arising from excessive dietary lipids and the pathogens p. gingivalis and c. pneumoniae are pro-atherogenic  <cit> , the specific inflammatory/atherogenic pathways induced by these individual stimuli in plaque progression are not well defined. in this study, we examined how exposure to two pathogens associated with atherosclerosis induces modulation of gene expression in aortic tissues using apoe-/- mice that spontaneously develop atherosclerosis in the absence of an additional pro-atherogenic stimulus. apoe-/- mice are the most widely used mouse model for the development of atherosclerosis in the absence of additional stimuli and are characterized by increased total plasma cholesterol levels . furthermore, we compared pathogen-induced gene signatures to apoe-/- mice fed a western diet. comparison of gene expression profiles obtained from pathogen treated mice at the acute and chronic time points was also examined to define how these pathogens modulate gene expression during the natural progression of atherosclerosis in apoe-/- mice.

RESULTS
pca and qrt-pcr analysis
principal component analysis  performed using all genes across all samples showed that there was strong separation between chronic and acute p. gingivalis treatment samples  along the pc <dig> axis, indicating that there was strong time-dependent differential gene expression in this treatment group. mean fold changes  obtained by taqman real time rt-pcr analysis for  <dig> genes were in good agreement with microarray results .

identification of pathways altered by chronic treatment with p. gingivalis, c. pneumoniae,or wd
to provide insight into the biological pathways and processes that are altered in response to each treatment, we used gene set enrichment analysis   to determine whether the members of gene sets involved in curated pathways and processes  were nonrandomly distributed across all genes interrogated by the array with respect to each treatment.

the gene sets that were coordinately upregulated  in response to p. gingivalis were related to proliferative signaling, matrix remodeling, execution of apoptosis, pdgf signaling, the secretin g-protein receptor family, and the lysosome . the gene sets with the strongest coordinate downregulation  with p. gingivalis treatment were involved in mitochondrial function and glucose metabolism , suggesting that p. gingivalis treatment may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic imbalance in the aorta. c. pneumoniae treatment was associated with the coordinate upregulation of genes involved in redox signaling, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, the mitochondrion, and vitamin metabolic processes , and the downregulation of genes related to muscle contraction and differentiation and channel activity . these findings suggest that c. pneumoniae treatment alters the redox state and metabolism of lipids that may promote the dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells in aortic tissue. the majority of gene sets that were coordinately upregulated in response to wd were those involved in defense and immune function; others included pathways related to macromolecular degradation and cell cycle regulation . gene sets that were negatively enriched in response to wd included tight junction regulation, receptor signaling, muscle proteins and channel activity . these findings suggest that dietary lipids and cholesterol are sensed by the innate and adaptive immune system in aortic tissue in a manner that promotes inflammation and loss of vascular barrier function.table  <dig>

time-dependent changes in aortic gene expression in mice treated with p. gingivalisor c. pneumoniae
to examine the acute response in aortic tissue following pathogen exposure, rna samples were obtained one day after the last treatment with p. gingivalis or c. pneumoniae . genes with nominally significant differential expression  between the chronic and acute time points in untreated or p. gingivalis- or c. pneumoniae-treated apoe-/- mice are tabulated in figure  <dig>  differential expression in all three groups was greater than expected by chance, and as in the comparison between groups at the chronic time point alone , p. gingivalis treatment produced the largest amount of differential gene expression, and the genes regulated by the two pathogens overlapped substantially. for the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes observed at the acute to chronic time points, aortic tissue from apoe-/- mice fed a normal chow diet was characterized by a balance of genes with increased and decreased expression; p. gingivalis treatment was skewed towards decreased expression . because time-dependent differential expression was less robust in the c. pneumoniae-treated group, these changes may reflect inhibition of natural changes that occur with time in the aortic tissue from apoe-/- mice fed a normal chow diet.figure  <dig>

functional classification of genes with varying kinetics of response to p. gingivalisor c. pneumoniaetreatment
using two-factor anova, we then analyzed the capacity of either pathogen to alter normal time-dependent changes in gene expression that occurred in apoe-/- mice. a clustering heat map of the  <dig> genes with the strongest interaction effect between time and treatment is shown in figure  <dig>  at the arbitrary cutoff of  <dig> genes, the anova interaction  fdr q value was <  <dig>  and the p value was <  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  the expression of genes encoding myofibril, cytoskeletal, and ion binding/transport proteins  greatly increased over time in untreated apoe-/- mice. however, treatment with either pathogen prevented or reversed this effect: the expression of these genes was increased and subsequently downregulated in the acute or chronic p. gingivalis-treated groups, respectively, and was unchanged in either c. pneumoniae treatment group. conversely, the expression of a number of zinc-finger transcription factors  was downregulated over time in untreated mice, but was decreased and then subsequently upregulated in the acute or chronic c. pneumoniae-treated groups, respectively, and was unchanged in either p. gingivalis treatment group. a third noteworthy pattern was defined by a group of genes with functions in fatty acid metabolism and ppar signaling whose expression was moderately downregulated over time in untreated animals ; this downregulation was greatly amplified in mice treated with p. gingivalis but was completely abrogated in mice treated with c. pneumoniae .figure  <dig>

functional classification of clusters of genes differentially expressed with respect to acute atherogenic stimuli
as before, the  <dig> genes with the greatest significance by one-way anova across the three acute treatment groups  were assigned to several groups using hierarchical clustering . acute treatment with p. gingivalis produced little differential gene expression, whereas acute treatment with c. pneumoniae resulted in large changes in gene expression. genes whose expression increased with c. pneumoniae treatment  represented g-protein coupled signaling, viral myocarditis, antigen processing and presentation, and membrane genes. by contrast, nearly half of the genes whose expression decreased with c. pneumoniae treatment  encoded phosphoproteins, with the remainder encoding proteins involved in alternative splicing, the endoplasmic reticulum, and glycoproteins and secreted proteins. the remaining clusters were not remarkable due to lack of annotation to a david pathway or of marginal significance . the three remaining clusters were not noteworthy .

analysis of genes associated with unstable plaque
a recent study identified  <dig> genes whose expression in the aortic tissue of apoe-/- mice was associated with unstable plaque  <cit> . we observed increased expression of several of these genes in aortic tissue from untreated apoe-/- mice fed a normal chow diet, which represents the natural progression of atherosclerosis ; and, in apoe-/- wd mice, we observed an even greater increase in expression of some of these genes. p. gingivalis treatment blunted the increase in expression of some genes and induced the expression of others. treatment with c. pneumoniae prevented the increase in all of the unstable plaque genes with the exception of mmp <dig>  which was increased over time in the c. pneumoniae-treated group but decreased over time in untreated apoe-/- mice.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we applied microarray analysis to define gene signatures in aortic tissues obtained from mice fed a western diet  or in mice treated with the oral pathogen p. gingivalis , or with the pulmonary pathogen c. pneumoniae . examination of gene expression profiles at the chronic time point enabled us to identify treatment-specific pro-atherogenic pathways rather than simply the genes expressed in established plaque. our results in untreated apoe-/- mice are consistent with a recent microarray study by papadodima et al.  <cit>  that documented changes in gene expression in aortic tissue of apoe-/- mice at three time points during the natural progression of atherosclerosis in the absence of additional pro-atherogenic stimuli. we identified common core sets of genes that were either increased or decreased in response to each of these pro-atherogenic stimuli.

contemporary analysis tools including gsea and david analysis were then applied. gsea approach is more powerful than single gene analysis, which merely highlights the top up- or downregulated genes and may overlook effects on specific pathways  <cit> . pathway analysis showed a markedly greater number of gene sets that were different among the three pro-atherogenic stimuli, suggesting that underlying vascular inflammation and dysfunction leading to atherosclerosis differ mechanistically and in the functional pathways leading to atherosclerosis progression depending upon stimulus. these findings are significant in that this is the first study that has performed direct, side-by-side, comparison of genome-wide aortic gene expression changes in three well-recognized models of atherosclerosis development.

treatment with wd, p. gingivalis or c. pneumoniae has pro-atherogenic effects that include alterations in macrophage function, cholesterol homeostasis, and endothelial dysfunction  <cit> . signaling through innate immune toll-like receptors  expressed on immune cells and the endothelium may be a common link among the three stimuli; however, notable differences in tlr usage as well as features unique to each of the two pathogens may account for the differences in signaling pathways activated and repressed. tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> rna and protein are expressed at high levels in endothelial cells and macrophages in human atherosclerotic plaque biopsies and the lipid-rich atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root of mice  <cit> . a role for tlrs in high-fat-diet-induced atherosclerosis in animal models has been shown in studies using apoe-/- tlr2-/- and apoe-/- tlr4-/- mice. interestingly specificity in tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> signaling by p. gingivalis and c. pneumoniae has been proposed to define specific inflammatory pathways unique to each organism . p. gingivalis expresses heterogeneous lps lipid a structures that weakly activate tlr <dig> but can also act as a tlr <dig> antagonist  <cit> , resulting in alterations in signaling through tlr <dig> that promote low-grade, chronic inflammation at distant sites including the aorta  <cit> . c. pneumoniae induces its proinflammatory signaling primarily through tlr <dig> but also expresses lps and signals through tlr <dig>  <cit> . the unique feature of c. pneumoniae is that it gains entry into monocytes as elementary bodies , which are infectious but metabolically inert. after entering macrophages or monocytes, ebs can rapidly differentiate to a replicative form known as reticulate bodies , and start bacterial replication  <cit> . rbs use the host’s metabolic metabolism and may find a favorable environment within a lipid-laden plaque to complete its replication. infected monocytes may circulate to distant sites to promote vascular inflammation  <cit> . c. pneumoniae may increase adherence of macrophages to endothelial cells through expression of its virulence factor, hsp  <dig>  which has been shown to promote monocyte attachment to endothelium, and to promote extravasation to sub-endothelial layer, where it oxidizes ldl and promotes foam cell formation  <cit> , a hallmark of atherosclerosis.

most published studies involving animal models of atherosclerosis have used high dietary lipids and cholesterol , and these studies have formed the basis for consensus around the mechanisms underlying the development of atherosclerosis. as a result, the use of statin drugs, which target cholesterol and lipid handling, are the most widely used class of drugs in the field of cardiovascular medicine. a recent study in circulation  <cit>  showed that despite the improvement of risk with optimum statin therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease, many patients demonstrate atheroma progression and additional cardiovascular events, suggesting that additional mechanisms are at play, highlighting the need to identify novel therapeutic strategies that combat the additional cardiovascular risk. recent research implicates vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction as a factor involved in the initiation, progression, and instability of atherosclerotic plaques and elevations of serum inflammatory biomarkers consistently associated with the risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event, providing further evidence for systemic inflammation involvement in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  <cit> .

given the prevalence of diet-induced obesity and infection with p. gingivalis and c. pneumoniae in the general population and the likelihood of co-morbidity of obesity with chronic or recurring infection with these common pathogens, these findings suggest that the development of atherosclerosis in humans is likely more complex and multifactorial than previously appreciated. atherosclerotic plaques undergo both progressive and regressive changes, which affect their size and stability; regression in lesion area can increase plaque stability. plasma cholesterol lowering has been associated with regression, and a recent study identified ppar-gamma as a “master regulator” of regression in early lesions  <cit> . our gsea analysis showed that c. pneumoniae treatment upregulated the ppar pathway while p. gingivalis treatment downregulated this pathway and thus may indicate a role for c. pneumoniae in regression and stability of early lesions, while p. gingivalis may inhibit plaque regression. p. gingivalis decreased pathways involved in mitochondrial function, suggesting that p. gingivalis promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, which is associated with cardiovascular risk, vascular dysfunction and plaque development  <cit> . western diet group had significant reduction in tight junction pathways and expression of genes encoding claudins, proteins involved in maintenance of cell-cell junctions. this finding is consistent with a recent study that showed that western diet promotes atherosclerosis in part via loss of tight junction control  <cit> . a surprising finding from the present study was that immune and inflammatory pathways were markedly upregulated in response to western diet. it has recently come to light that certain lipids in western style diets are either endogenous ligands of tlrs or assist with pattern recognition of tlrs  <cit> . consistent with this, prior studies have shown that tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and myd <dig> knockout mice on an apoe-/- background had decreased atherosclerotic aortic plaque in response to a western diet  <cit> . a recent microarray study by hyvarinen et al., compared gene expression in adipose tissue following chronic infection with c. pneumoniae and/or a periodontal pathogen, a. actinomycetemcomitans  and revealed significant enrichment in inflammation associated pathways by aa or a combination of aa and c. pneumoniae but not by c. pneumoniae alone as compared to a control group  <cit> .

of interest was the increased expression of a number of genes associated with vulnerable plaque previously identified by chen et al.  <cit>  in aortic tissues obtained from mice at the chronic phase compared to tissues obtained at the acute phase. these genes were bmper, hdc, ifitm <dig>  s100a <dig>  upp <dig>  adamts <dig>  fpr <dig>  clec4n, hmox <dig> and irg <dig>  our findings demonstrate that expression of these genes increases as part of the natural progression of atherosclerosis in apoe-/- mice in the absence of an additional pro-atherogenic stimulus. importantly, the increased expression of these genes was blunted at the chronic time point in mice treated with c. pneumoniae. expression of kit was increased in the c. pneumoniae -treated group compared to the chronic control group. in addition, p. gingivalis treatment blunted the increase in expression of bmper, hdc, ifitm <dig>  s100a <dig>  upp <dig> and hmox <dig>  expression of egln <dig> was decreased in the p. gingivalis-treated group compared to the chronic control group. expression of clec4n and hmox <dig> was increased in the western diet group compared to the chronic control group. the identification of differences in the effects of each of the pro-atherogenic stimuli on expression of important vulnerable plaque genes may result in differences in the nature and composition of the atherosclerotic plaque, which will be explored in future studies.

limitations of the study
several limitations of the study should be noted. we could not simultaneously perform a side-by-side quantification of the degree of the aortic plaque and the pathological features assessed by histology induced by the three atherogenic stimuli. we also could not determine the contribution of possible alterations in gut microbiota induced by each of the pro-atherogenic treatments or following antiobiotics pre-treatment in the p. gingivalis group. we could not validate our findings with regard to establishing that the pathways we identified are mechanistically linked to each pro-atherogenic stimulus at the protein level. we also acknowledge the limitations of using mouse models to draw conclusions about human diseases, which are more complex and multifactorial. future studies will also investigate the effects of comorbidity with  <dig> or more pro-atherogenic stimuli, which resembles scenarios that occur clinically.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study suggests that p. gingivalis treatment may promote atherosclerosis by stimulating mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibiting the egress of endogenous lipids from the vessel wall, whereas c. pneumoniae may promote atherosclerosis by enhancing lipid uptake and metabolism into the vessel wall, and wd may promote atherosclerosis by activation of inflammatory and immune pathways that enhance leukocyte adhesion and endothelial dysfunction.
