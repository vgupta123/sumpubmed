BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is a highly versatile gram-negative bacterium capable of invading epithelial cells  <cit>  as well as surviving in macrophages  <cit> . common routes of entry for b. pseudomallei are via cutaneous inoculation, inhalation, or ingestion. melioidosis is endemic in southeast asia, northern australia and other tropical regions  <cit> , and clinical outcome is relatively dependent on the size of the inoculum and the existence of predisposing risk factors  <cit> . b. pseudomallei possesses an extensive arsenal of recognized virulence determinants, including three “injection type” type iii secretion systems  and six type vi secretion systems . t3sss are present in many gram-negative pathogens and translocate “effector” proteins into eukaryotic host cells to alter their cellular response. in b. pseudomallei, only t3ss <dig> has been implicated in animal pathogenesis  <cit> , while t3ss <dig> and − <dig> are predicted to mediate interactions with plants  <cit> . t3ss <dig> has also been shown to be important for bacterial escape from phagosomes or endosomes into the host cytosol  <cit>  and caspase 1-induced pyroptosis  <cit> .

since t3ss is a virulence determinant utilized by a variety of gram-negative species, mammalian hosts have evolved sensors to detect the presence of t3sss during pathogenesis. in macrophages, the t3ss of salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, b. pseudomallei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic e. coli trigger a proinflammatory response mediated by the nlrc <dig> inflammasome and subsequent activation of caspase  <dig>  <cit> . in yersinia, it is unclear whether caspase  <dig> activation is triggered by the translocon pore or via unknown t3ss-related factors  <cit> . in addition to detection by the inflammasome machinery, yersinia <cit>  and salmonella <cit>  can be detected by nfκb in a toll-like receptor  and myd <dig> independent manner that is reliant on t3ss, revealing another possible mechanism whereby t3ss can be detected by host epithelial cells which lack inflammasome machinery. using human embryonic kidney cells , which are epithelial cells that lack tlr  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> expression but expresses low levels of tlr <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , we have previously shown that b. pseudomallei stimulates nfκb independently of tlrs and myd <dig>  leading to the production of il- <dig>  nfκb activation required bacterial internalization and a functional t3ss <dig>  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether nfκb activation is triggered by t3ss <dig> effector proteins, by components of the t3ss secretion apparatus itself, or indirectly via additional t3ss3-mediated processes.

our goal is to determine how t3ss <dig> contributes to nfκb activation in the absence of tlr, myd <dig> and inflammasome signalling using hek293t epithelial cells as a model system. we show that t3ss3-mediated endosome escape is required for nfκb activation and occurs independently of known t3ss <dig> effector proteins. using a photothermal nanoblade to directly place bacteria into the cytoplasm, we show that cytosolic localization is sufficient to activate nfκb. thus, b. pseudomallei t3ss <dig> is not directly detected by the host nfκb pathway but is instead responsible for bacterial escape from vacuolar compartments subsequently leading to the activation of cytosolic sensors.

RESULTS
tlr-independent nfκb activation by b. pseudomallei is dependent on the activity of t3ss <dig> but not known t3ss <dig> effector proteins
we had previously shown that activation of nfκb in hek293t cells by b. pseudomallei was not dependent on host tlr and myd <dig> signalling but required a functional bacterial t3ss <dig>  <cit> . here, we first investigate whether b. pseudomallei t3ss <dig> and t3ss <dig> contribute to nfκb activation, or if it is a specific consequence of t3ss <dig> activity. derivatives of b. pseudomallei strain khw containing deletions of the entire t3ss <dig>  t3ss <dig> or t3ss <dig> gene clusters were constructed by allelic exchange. hek293t cells that were transiently transfected with the nfκb-seap  reporter system were infected with wildtype khw or mutant strain, and assayed for nfκb activation 6 hr. later. as shown in figure 1a, infection with the Δt3ss <dig> strain showed reduced nfκb activation in contrast to the Δt3ss <dig> and Δt3ss <dig> mutant derivatives, which led to robust activation comparable to wildtype bacteria. as the Δt3ss <dig> mutant was unable to replicate as well as wildtype khw and the other mutants , the lack of nfκb activation could be due to lower bacterial numbers. furthermore, it is known that complete deletion of t3ss <dig> also inactivates t6ss <dig> due to removal of t6ss <dig> regulatory loci located in the t3ss <dig> gene cluster  <cit> . to determine whether nfκb activation is dependent on the activity of t3ss <dig> or t6ss <dig>  a strain containing an in-frame deletion in bsam, which encodes an inner membrane ring component of t3ss <dig> that is essential for function, was assayed in parallel  <cit> . the Δbsam mutation does not affect t6ss regulatory loci that are present in the t3ss <dig> gene cluster. the results in figure 1c demonstrate that infection with the Δbsam and the Δt3ss <dig> mutants leads to equivalently low levels of nfκb activation compared to wildtype khw, even at high multiplicity of infection . all subsequent experiments were then performed with the Δbsam mutant instead of the Δt3ss <dig> mutant. the amount of bacterial-induced cellular cytotoxicity was very low  and comparable across all strains and mois , showing that difference in nfκb activation is not due to differing levels of cell death. the lack of increase in nfκb activation at moi of 50: <dig> could be due to nfκb suppression mediated by the presence of tssm in the strains, as we had previously reported  <cit> .

the role of t3ss is to translocate effector proteins into the eukaryotic cell interior. unlike the t3sss of some other pathogenic species such as salmonella and shigella, b. pseudomallei t3ss <dig> possesses only three known effectors; bopa  <cit> , bopc  <cit> , and bope  <cit> . when cells were infected with Δbopa, Δbopc or Δbope strains and nfκb activation was measured at 6 hr. after infection, no significant difference was observed compared to wildtype khw. in the case of the ∆bsam mutant, activation was minimal as expected, whereas the ∆bopace triple effector mutant showed a slight reduction in nfκb activation  compared to wildtype bacteria  . moreover, the ∆bsam strain exhibited an approximately  <dig> -fold reduction in the numbers of intracellular bacteria compared to wildtype bacteria at the same 6 hr. time point, while Δbopace was only slightly  reduced , corresponding with their respective abilities to activate nfκb shown in figure 2a. thus, lower nfκb activation is likely due to lower replication rates of the ∆bsam and Δbopace mutants, and does not seem to be contributed by the known t3ss <dig> effectors.

t3ss <dig> does not facilitate invasion of bacteria into cells but rather promotes their subsequent escape from endocytic vesicles  <cit> . therefore, defective endosome escape by mutants may provide an explanation for their reduced replication and inability to activate nfκb. thus, we examined whether the ability of these mutants to activate nfκb correlate with their ability to escape from the endosome. the formation of multinucleated giant cells  at 10–12 hr. following infection was utilized as a measure of endosome escape, since it requires the activity of t6ss <dig> and only occurs if bacteria have escaped from endocytic vesicles into the cytosol  <cit> . we examined the formation of mngc at 12 hr. post infection of the single and triple effector mutants in comparison with wildtype khw and the escape-deficient Δbsam . all strains could induce mngc at this time-point except for Δbsam, indicating that the ability to activate nfκb correlates with the ability to escape. Δbopace formed less mngcs compared to the rest, likely reflecting its lower replication ability.

another possibility is that the Δbsam and Δbopace strains are defective in the secretion of t3ss <dig> effector proteins, which could be responsible for activating nfκb as has been reported for the t3ss effector proteins sope and sipa from salmonella <cit> . this is unlikely given that our single effector mutants could still activate nfκb as well as wildtype bacteria. to confirm, bopa , bopc  or bope  were ectopically expressed in increasing plasmid concentrations in hek293t cells. none of the burkholderia effectors were able to activate nfκb significantly above background levels with the exception of bope , a homolog of salmonella sope, which showed only a slight activation. in contrast, expression of salmonella sope led to robust activation. we verified that the proteins were indeed expressed at the mrna level  as well as at the protein level for bope . it is therefore doubtful that individual t3ss <dig> effectors are responsible for nfκb activation in hek293t cells, but that activation likely depends on t3ss3-mediated escape from endocytic vesicles following invasion.

t3ss <dig> mutants activate nfκb when they gain access to the host cytosol
it is known that t3ss <dig> facilitates escape from phagosomal or endosomal compartments into the host cell cytosol  <cit> , although b. pseudomallei t3ss <dig> mutants have been observed to exhibit delayed escape via an unidentified mechanism  <cit> . a time-course of nfκb activation shows that the t3ss <dig> mutant ∆bsam was unable to activate nfκb at 6 hr. after infection, although it was increasingly able to do so when the incubation was extended to 24 hr. , where levels became comparable to infection with wildtype khw. in figure 2c, we had shown that ∆bsam mutant was unable to form mngcs at 12 hr., corresponding to their inability to activate nfκb at early time-points. by 18 hr., both wildtype khw and ∆bsam mutant induced the formation of mngcs . on the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that t3ss-independent escape from endosomes is responsible for nfκb activation by the ∆bsam mutant at later time points, and the critical event required for nfκb activation is bacterial entry into the cytosol.

if nfκb activation at early time points results from rapid escape from the endosome, then direct placement of bacteria into the cytosol should obviate the need for t3ss-mediated escape. this was tested using a photothermal nanoblade, which allows us to bypass the need for invasion and endosome escape altogether  <cit> . the photothermal nanoblade utilizes a 6 ns pulse from a 540 nm laser to excite a titanium coating on glass micropipettes that are brought into contact with mammalian cell membranes. rapid heating results in the formation of a vapour “nanobubble”, creating a local, transient delivery portal in the membrane bilayer through which cargo can be introduced. the advantages of photothermal nanoblade compared to traditional microinjection are that variably-sized particles – from molecules to bacteria - can be efficiently delivered into a wide range of cell types, and cell viability is maintained since physical puncturing does not occur.

b. thailandensis was used for these experiments since the instrument is not adapted for use in a bsl- <dig> environment. b. thailandensis encodes a t3ss apparatus  that is highly homologous to b. pseudomallei t3ss <dig> and functions in an analogous manner  <cit> . its intracellular growth and intercellular spread characteristics are comparable to b. pseudomallei, making it a useful surrogate for studying the burkholderia intracellular life cycle. we first established that nfκb activation is dependent on b. thailandensis t3ssbsa, as the t3ssbsa mutant ∆bsas <cit>  did not markedly activate nfκb at 6 hr. after infection at an moi of 10: <dig> , but did so at 24 hr. using the same moi , similar to what was seen with b. pseudomallei . bsas encodes the atpase for t3ssbsa, and b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis ∆bsas derivatives have been shown to be deficient in t3ssbsa function, including lower intracellular replication  <cit> . pma and ionomycin treatment served as positive controls for the photothermal nanoblade experiments, and nfκb /293/gfp-luc cells were used so that nfκb activity could be measured by luciferase activity as well as gfp fluorescence. we were struck by the finding that 6 hr. after photothermal nanoblade delivery of bacteria into the host cell cytosol, both wildtype bacteria  and the ∆bsas mutant showed comparable gfp fluorescence and hence, nfκb activation . uninfected cells did not produce detectable gfp fluorescence . similarly, both the wildtype and ∆bsas mutant bacteria activated nfκb extensively at 24 hr. following nanoblade delivery . taken together, these results demonstrate that t3ssbsa mutants are able to activate nfκb effectively at early time-points if the need to escape from vacuolar compartments is bypassed by direct delivery of bacteria into the cytosol.

b. pseudomallei stimulates activation of endogenous nfκb in hek293t cells
as previous experiments involved activation of an nfκb reporter, we wanted to measure endogenous levels of nfκb activity in hek293t cells infected with b. pseudomallei. to this end, we measured the phosphorylation of key nfκb signalling intermediates beginning with the most downstream signalling molecule in the pathway, the nfκb p <dig> subunit. infection of cells with wildtype bacteria, but not Δt3ss <dig> or Δbsam mutants, led to a pronounced increase in phosphorylated p <dig>  whereas total p <dig> remained constant at 2 hr. and 3 hr. post infection . phosphorylation of the central iκbα was also seen following infection with wildtype bacteria, but not with b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis ∆bsam mutants . a key signalling intermediate in the nfκb activation pathway is tak <dig>  which lies upstream of the ikk complex and is triggered by various stimuli such as tnfα, il-1β, tlrs, tgfβ and dna damage  <cit> . we found that b. pseudomallei infection resulted in a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated tak <dig> , which was greatly reduced following infection with b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis ∆bsam mutants . thus, these experiments show that infection with wildtype bacteria, but not t3ss3-defective mutants, leads to endogenous nfκb activation accompanied by activation of tak <dig>  in agreement with our previous data with the nfκb reporter assays.

discussion
several gram-negative bacterial pathogens capable of infecting epithelial cells possess secretion systems such as t3ss or t4ss that modulate nfκb signalling. in legionella pneumophila, nfκb activation was shown to occur via a tlr dependent pathway, as well as a tlr-independent pathway that requires the icm/dot translocation system  <cit> . recently, a icm/dot substrate lnab has been identified to be responsible for tlr-independent activation of nfκb with activation of rip <dig>  in hek293t cells  <cit> . another t4ss secreted effector, legk <dig>  activates nfκb directly by phosphorylating nfκb inhibitor iκbα, leading to downstream activation independent of host prrs  <cit> .

intestinal pathogens such as salmonella and shigella have been shown to activate nfκb in intestinal epithelial cells in a tlr independent manner. for example, shigella flexneri invades and activates nod <dig>  which senses bacterial peptidoglycan, leading to il- <dig> production  <cit> . in salmonella, the t3ss effector sope activates nfκb  <cit>  by engaging small rho gtpases cdc <dig> and rac <dig>  which in turn trigger nod <dig> and rip <dig> activation of nfκb  <cit> . another salmonella t3ss effector protein sipa was also found to activate nfκb via nod1/nod <dig> signalling pathway that proceeds through rip <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, it cannot be definitively determined in yersinia whether the t3ss cargo or translocon pore is responsible for activating nfκb  <cit> .

in this study, we have shown that b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis t3ss <dig> do not directly activate nfκb in any significant way in hek293t epithelial cells. t3ss <dig> is necessary for efficient escape of bacteria from endosomal/phagosomal compartments into the cytosol at early time-points, although some escape may occur with low efficiency at later time-points independently of t3ss <dig>  <cit> . although the direct delivery of t3ss <dig> mutants was done only with b. thailandensis, the time course of mngc formation and nfκb activation of b. pseudomallei ∆bsam mutants, and the similarity in various parameters between the two species in our experiments as well as what has been reported in the literature  <cit>  would support our conclusion. in contrast to what has been found for salmonella, known t3ss <dig> effectors are not essential for nfκb activation by burkholderia. this is supported by several lines of evidence: t3ss mutant bacteria exhibit delayed but significant nfκb activation at later time-points, corresponding to their escape into the cytosol; overexpressed t3ss <dig> effectors do not activate nfκb; and direct delivery of bacteria into the cytosol via nanoblade injection obviates the need for t3ss <dig> in nfκb activation even at early time-points. thus, the key event triggering nfκb activation is the presence of burkholderia in the cytoplasm. we have not completely ruled out the possibility that unknown t3ss <dig> effectors secreted by other t3sss in the absence of t3ss <dig> may partly be responsible for the nfκb activation we see, but even if this is true, it likely plays a minor role as the activation would not have depended so much on the cytosolic presence of the bacteria. the requirement for cytosolic presence of the pathogen likely reflects the host’s reliance on cytosolic sensors to detect generic pathogen associated molecular patterns  rather than the specific recognition of t3ss- or t4ss-associated proteins as seen for pathogens that depend on survival within a vacuolar compartment such as salmonella and legionella. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the cytosolic presence of bacteria expose t3ss <dig> structural components to activate nfκb.

the detection of endogenous tak <dig> activation in hek293t cells following infection with wildtype, but not t3ss <dig> mutants, suggests the activation of the intracellular pattern recognition receptors  nod <dig> and nod <dig>  both of which signal through tak <dig>  b. pseudomallei is reportedly able to signal through nod <dig> in raw <dig>  macrophages to upregulate suppressor of cytokine signalling  <dig>  although it does not result in similar upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines tnfα, il-1β and il- <dig> which depend on activation of nfκb  <cit> . recently, it is reported that nod <dig> plays a minor role in murine melioidosis and a human genetic polymorphism in nod <dig> region is associated with melioidosis  <cit> . it is possible that nod <dig> and nod <dig>  which sense bacterial peptidoglycan derivatives ie-dap and muramyl dipeptide respectively, may be the major cytosolic sensors responsible for nfκb activation.

CONCLUSIONS
use of the hek293t cells has allowed us to determine how burkholderia t3ss <dig> contributes to nfκb activation in the absence of tlr and myd <dig> signalling. we were able to discern that activation of nfκb does not occur as a direct consequence of burkholderia t3ss <dig> secretion of effectors, but rather through cytosolic sensors that respond to the presence of bacteria in the cytosol following t3ss3-mediated escape from endocytic vesicles. our study serves as a model for future work to identify the cytosolic sensors and the conditions leading to nfκb activation. it is possible that nfκb is not triggered efficiently by surface or endosomal prrs, whereupon cytosolic sensors become important in establishing recognition of bacterial pathogens and eventual protection. alternatively, the activation of these cytosolic sensors may lead to a different gene expression program that provides a regulatory function distinct from the tlr response.
