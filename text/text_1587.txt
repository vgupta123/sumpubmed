BACKGROUND
given its phylogenetic key position as an early diverging land plant that bridges the gap of about one billion years between the unicellular green algae and flowering plants, the moss physcomitrella patens  unites most of the attributes desirable for a model organism, including a short generation time, small stature, comparatively low morphological complexity, a haplo-dominant life cycle, traceable cell lineage, high growth rate and simplicity of genetic transformation. combined with the potential for evolutionary-developmental  studies, these traits have become increasingly attractive to a wide range of plant scientists. over the last two decades, a growing community has established p. patens as a model organism with a well-developed molecular toolbox including the uniquely efficient gene targeting via homologous recombination and comprehensive genomics resources which have been made available early on using the central web service cosmoss.org  <cit> . the moss is also a promising model for green biotechnology  <cit> , which allows the production of safe recombinant proteins with eukaryotic post-translational modifications in competitive quantities.

the draft genome sequence of the moss physcomitrella patens was published in  <dig>  <cit> . the availability of the genomic sequence and the established molecular toolbox provide the ideal foundation for extensive comparative and evo-devo analyses studies. this is reflected in the publication record - a growing body of researchers from all fields has begun to apply physcomitrella as an additional model organism for comparative studies  <cit> . various evo-devo studies have demonstrated the ability of physcomitrella transgenes to act as functional orthologs in cross-species complementation assays using a. thaliana mutant lines . additionally, large-scale analyses and cross-kingdom comparisons increasingly utilize the moss as a representative organism for the plant kingdom  <cit> . this ongoing interest, the available resources, the active community, and the moss’ attractive phylogenetic position recently led the u.s. department of energy’s joint genome institute  to select p. patens as a “plant flagship genome”  <cit> .

the quality of a genome annotation is the bottleneck for any form of downstream and comparative analyses. particularly affected by flaws are the large-scale, high-throughput approaches employed in systems biology  <cit> . following its initial v <dig>  annotation, the p. patens genome annotation has been iteratively improved. the draft v <dig> assembly was based on whole-genome shotgun sanger sequencing at  <dig> x clone depth and comprises 2536 v <dig> scaffolds. this number was reduced to  <dig> in the released v <dig>  after removal of bacterial contaminations  <cit> . after an additional round of scaffold filtering, released as v <dig> , the genome sequence of the  <dig> chromosomes is still scattered over  <dig> genomic scaffolds  <cit> . the filtering of the gene catalogue, in particular by removal of transposable elements and other non-protein coding regions, led to the prediction of  <dig>  protein-coding genes  <cit> . the results of a survey conducted on behalf of the jgi at the annual moss meeting  <dig> clearly show that for most groups  the initial sequencing and release of the genome was already “essential”. however, many research topics were listed that “would be enabled if a highly complete and accurate reference genome for physcomitrella was available”, revealing the need for advanced genome annotation. for example, there were cases of well-characterized moss genes that were present in the genomic sequence but were missing from the gene catalogue  <cit> . in v <dig>  only  <dig>  gene models had both 5’ and 3’-utrs . over  <dig>  genes missed either 5’-utr or 3’-utr annotation and thus were incomplete. furthermore, functional annotation was only available for 41% of the genes and hardly any of these annotations were backed by traceable experimental evidence. a further shortcoming was that no established and universal means for scientists and curators existed to link  knowledge on moss genes to the digital representations scattered across several databases.

model organism databases  are integrated, web-accessible resources, which are prerequisite for the success and the quality of a reference genome  <cit> . they act as general repositories for all kinds of research data and scientific knowledge that is generated by the scientific community. thus, they provide the necessary infrastructure for researchers working with model species, are the focal point for scientists new or outside the field and provide conceptual interfaces for data exchange with more general data repositories  to enable comparative analyses and ensure overall data quality  <cit> .

experience from various mods and whole genome sequencing projects shows that automatic annotation without substantial manual curation is not sufficient to ensure data quality and knowledge discovery  <cit> . an active community is necessary to transfer all available data, especially the biological knowledge covered by the scientific literature, to the genome annotation  <cit> .

initially, the cosmoss.org resource was set up to provide access to the p. patens virtual transcriptome assemblies and annotation  <cit>  using blast services, keyword search and sequence retrieval. subsequently, it was extended to provide services for splice site prediction  <cit> , for mining gene families of transcription associated proteins  and to predict dual protein targeting . since the release of the initial p. patens genome assembly, the resource cosmoss.org additionally provides access to the draft genome sequence  <cit> , the genetic map  <cit> , and the filtered genome annotation v <dig>   <cit> . moreover, cosmoss.org serves as a platform to coordinate the analysis and annotation of the p. patens genome sequence. as part of this, a wiki and several mailing lists have been set up to report and discuss the results within the community. additionally, an integrative genome browser serves as a main entrance point for the exploration of the moss genome and annotation. the integrative cosmoss.org browser is based on the gbrowse software  <cit>  and provides base pair level resolution for large-scale annotation data covering predictions for all different kinds of genomic regions ranging from protein-coding genes, transposable elements and repeats to trna, rrna, mirnas, and other non-protein coding rnas. furthermore, the annotations are linked to the cosmoss.org internal annotation resources as well as to genbank  <cit> , pfam  <cit> , mirbase  <cit>  and comparative genomics resources like phytozome  <cit>  and plaza  <cit> .

while a significant part of cosmoss.org is based on our analyses, we are continuously integrating external published data, e.g. srnas  <cit> , mirnas  <cit>  and est  or short read data from the sequence read archive  and from collaborators around the world. in addition, the cosmoss.org gene annotation releases are shared and hosted at the ncbi and the comparative plant resources, phytozome, plaza, and plantgdb  <cit> . in july  <dig>  the physcomitrella community annotation services were transferred from the jgi website to cosmoss.org and the resource now functions as the central annotation repository for the moss p. patens.

here, we report the complete re-annotation of the p. patens genome assembly v <dig> , demonstrate its utility for comparative analyses and introduce the extensions to the cosmoss.org resource to act as a permanent central genome annotation repository and model organism database involving:

• the improvement of gene structures with specific focus on the incorporation of transcript evidence to cover alternative splice variants and to derive utrs.

• complete renewal of the functional annotation.

• prediction and annotation of non-protein-coding genes.

• integration of user annotations: structural and functional annotations.

• integration of manual annotations: development of community annotation services.

*including splice variants &data from the mirbase registry, release  <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
improved structural annotation of the p. patens genome
the cosmoss.org physcomitrella patens v <dig>  genome annotation reported here is the result of iterative rounds of evidence mapping, repeat masking, gene structure prediction, filtering and model selection and harbors annotation of protein-coding genes, transposable and repetitive elements and, for the first time, definition of non-protein-coding loci. the release comprises  <dig>  protein-coding genes,  <dig> trna loci,  <dig> rdna regions,  <dig> mirna precursors   <cit> ,  <dig> snrna genes, and  <dig> srp  loci. considering the number of mirna families, p. patens with  <dig> families has an intermediate position between the green alga c. reinhardtii  and the flowering plant a. thaliana   <cit> . consistent with previous findings  <cit>  about half of the genome consists of full length ltr retrotransposons and related fragments including chromodomain-containing gypsy ltr retrotransposons  shared by fungi and non-flowering plants  <cit> .

v <dig>  protein-coding gene predictions are based on multiple sources of evidence. of prime importance are ests  from  <dig> different experimental conditions, tissue types and developmental stages providing a reliable basis for gene structure prediction. the combined transcript evidence was used to train species-specific prediction models using splicemachine  <cit>  and eugène  <cit> , followed by the generation of weighted consensus gene structures using evidencemodeler  <cit>  and pasa  <cit> . the prediction procedure was repeated iteratively. each round involved several filtering steps for separation of non-protein coding, repeat and transposable element-associated genes. the interim versions v <dig> - <dig>  were not published but are the basis for v <dig>  . the whole protein-coding gene prediction and annotation process is summarized in additional file 3: figure a <dig>  the annotation release v <dig>  comprises  <dig>  loci coding for  <dig>  protein-coding transcripts .  <dig>   loci are supported by transcript evidence . the average v <dig>  gene has a mean length of 2369 bp and a transcript length of 1389 bp. the number of only  <dig> unchanged gene models from v <dig>  to v <dig>  is an excellent indicator of the extent of changes and improvements that led to the current release. while the changes in release v <dig>   were restricted to the removal/filtering of non-protein-coding genes , the complete annotation process leading to v <dig>   resulted in  <dig>   updated models,  <dig>  new loci and  <dig>  models which have been removed due to non-protein coding/transposable element origin. of the new loci,  <dig> transcripts  are part of a gene family with at least one additional plant species, and  <dig> transcripts  encode at least one pfam domain. also, published genes and gene models released by the scientific community were mapped, manually curated and integrated into v <dig> .

inspection of utr annotations indicates that gene structure completeness is much improved in v <dig> . the number of protein-coding loci with both 5’ and 3’ utrs were increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  transcripts. the median transcript length increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> bases  which can be explained by a higher percentage of annotated utr regions in this release. v <dig>  gene models only contain utr annotations if they are fully supported by transcript evidence.

to further assess model quality and completeness we compared predicted protein sequences from v <dig>  and v <dig>  based on the coverage of their respective closest homolog in a. thaliana . the direct comparison demonstrates v <dig>  models generally as more complete than those in v <dig> :  <dig> % of the v <dig>  proteins with a corresponding v <dig>  model cover a higher proportion of the length of their best a. thaliana blastp hit.

annotation and characterization of alternative splicing
we used the pasa pipeline  <cit>  to study the extent and characteristics of alternative splicing  in the moss. we used genomethreader  <cit>  transcript alignments in exchange of pasa’s standard gmap alignments  <cit>  as genomethreader supports alignment of transcript evidence to multiple  loci. this is important for covering nearly identical tandemly-arrayed genes observed in p. patens <cit>  and of other segmental duplications.

in total, the pasa pipeline reported  <dig>  genes  out of which  <dig>  show as . consistent with previous analyses  <cit> , we find alternative acceptors as the most prevalent event of as  in pasa assemblies. among gene loci with alternate transcripts, intron retention is the most frequent form . analysis based on large-scale est libraries largely derived from total rna preparations, undoubtedly include partially spliced intermediates which might lead to an overestimation of the fraction of intron retention variants, however our data reflect the findings observed for other plants where intron retention is the preferred form of as, followed by an alternative acceptor  <cit> . based on the sanger est data the percentage of genes with evidence for as in p. patens  is in the range of flowering plants like a. thaliana  and oryza sativa . given the fact that recently the use of next generation deep sequencing data resulted in a substantial upward revision of the number of alternatively spliced genes in a. thaliana to at least 42%  <cit>  we expect the true extent of as to be similar in the moss. this is also supported by the extent of nagnag alternative splicing based on ngs data which is in the same range as in flowering plants  <cit> .

overview of the alternative splicing events observed in p. patens using the pasa software and ~ <dig>  ests.

in v <dig>  we have incorporated information on as for the first time into the released genome annotation. the integration of as into the annotation process leads to  <dig>  annotated loci with an average of  <dig>  transcripts per locus and a maximum of  <dig> transcripts in v <dig> .  <dig> loci  have an altered coding sequence  due to alternative splicing resulting in  <dig> distinct proteins. in contrast to a. thaliana, where the analysis of large-scale full-length cdnas suggested most splicing events to occur outside of coding regions in the 5’-utr  <cit> , alternative splicing in moss seems to affect utrs and cds regions to a similar degree.  <dig> alternative transcripts are due to alternative splicing in the utrs of  <dig> loci . extensive alternative splicing of moss 5’-utrs was observed previously in an individual study of the mdhar genes  <cit> .

insights into the evolution of gene structures along the green lineage
the advanced annotation enabled us to address comparative questions on genome and gene structure evolution in plants. a comprehensive overview of genome and protein-coding gene statistics of several viridiplantae species is compiled in table  <dig> and additional file 4: table a <dig>  our complete re-evaluation of the respective genome annotations supports previous observations, but also provides novel insights. the average volvocine green algal gene is about twice the length of the average land plant gene  <cit> . this trend is not as pronounced in the transcript and cds lengths, but still the average algal transcript is longer than those of the land plants . while the median exon length is similar in all seven viridiplantae species, chlamydomonas introns are longer and more numerous than those of land plants .

selected properties of structure and organization of protein-coding genes within viridiplantae. a more detailed list can be found in additional file 4: table a <dig>  x̄ - average x̃ - median # - amount.

corresponding with its intermediary phylogenetic position, the median intron length of the average p. patens gene is intermediate  between that of algae and flowering plants, implicating a trend towards shorter introns during the evolution of land plants. whereas the median algal 5’-utr length are in the range of tracheophyta, the median moss 5’-utr length is about 100 bp longer. moss 5’-utr regions more frequently comprise multiple exons than other plant genomes, with 40% of genes so annotated. additionally, although there are substantially more predicted transcripts in o. sativa and more transcripts with 5’-utr introns , the total number of transcripts with multiple 5’-utr exons in p. patens is nearly as high  ; figure 2). this will likely increase as further high-resolution transcriptome data are obtained, since only  <dig>  moss transcripts currently have annotated 5’utrs compared with  <dig>  transcripts in the rice annotation.

in a. thaliana introns in the 5’-utrs tend to be longer than introns in the coding sequence and 3’-utrs  <cit> . a plot of p. patens intron lengths  reveals a similar distribution. p. patens 5’-utr introns are significantly longer than introns in the cds  and 3’-utr . in particular, the percentage of introns longer than 500 bp is much higher in the 5’-utrs than in the cds or in the 3’-utrs. the mean 5’-utr intron length for p. patens is 520 bp, whereas it is 264 bp for the cds and 268 bp for 3’-utr introns.

furthermore, in a. thaliana the 5’-utr introns are preferentially located close to the initiating atg codon  <cit> . a comparative distribution plot of the proximate 5’-utr intron distance to the start of transcription and translation reveals similar distributions in p. patens and a. thaliana . certainly the closeness of 5’-utr introns to the initiating atg is more pronounced in a. thaliana . chung et al.  provided initial evidence for a positive effect of the presence of 5’-utr introns on gene expression. these findings and previous reports suggest that properties of 5’-utr introns influence gene expression level, regulation, translation and nonsense-mediated mrna decay  <cit> . as a consequence, the high percentage of genes with 5’-utr introns, their unique length, and the fact that ~50% of p. patens loci with annotated alternative transcripts undergo alternative splicing in utrs, suggests that the moss makes frequent use of this type of gene regulation.

improved functional annotation of moss proteins
the predicted v <dig>  protein sequences were functionally annotated by homology transfer using blast2go  <cit>  and interproscan  <cit> . existing gene ontology annotations  from previous releases were mapped, curated and integrated. goa were extended using a novel in-house subcellular localization annotation pipeline called pred2goa which allows the integration of goas from multiple sources by weighted combination of results from experimental evidence, subcellular target predictions and homology-based methods  to improve goa accuracy. the resulting non-redundant, transcript-wise p. patens v <dig>  goa contains  <dig>  terms . while we could increase the number of terms in the go namespaces “biological process”  and “cellular component” , the number is reduced for “molecular function”  in comparison to v <dig> . however, comparison of both goas reveals a prominent set of protein kinase family proteins  with a very high number of assigned terms  in v <dig> . manual inspection identified these terms as false assignments. excluding these false-positive terms leads to a general increase of terms and annotated gene products in v <dig>  . in total,  <dig>  loci, i.e. 58% of all predicted protein-coding genes, have been assigned at least one go term. this is a substantial improvement over v <dig>  . while we could increase the number of genes with a term for “biological process”  by  <dig> and “molecular function”  by  <dig>  the number of genes with a “cellular component”  term has increased by  <dig> . a significant part of the assigned “cellular component” terms are based on supervised subcellular target predictions . to help scientists in evaluating the quality of annotations, we rely on the assignment of evidence codes  <cit> , which offer a direct interpretation of the support for each goa. after the automatic processing of terms, most of the annotations  is still supported only by iea  followed by iss  with ~23%. as noted earlier, only a few genes have annotation supported by experimental evidence. this now becomes obvious in the goa - only  <dig> genes have evidence codes indicative of experimental support . with the development of our cosmoss.org community annotation service discussed below we hope to improve this situation and invite scientists to annotate their genes of interest. building on and extending the gaf format, our databases and web service also offers additional information for every goa describing the algorithmic or experimental source, references and crosslinks which can be used to further assess the quality of annotations.

a general increase of protein-coding genes with an assigned go term could be achieved in v <dig> . the number of go terms “molecular function” has been manually corrected for v <dig>  . bp – “biological process”: mf – “molecular function”; cc –“cellular component”.

the most common and useful application of goa is the comprehensive functional analysis of experimentally defined gene sets by ontology term enrichment analysis  <cit> . the significance of results obtained by enrichment analysis strongly depends on the quality and depth of the underlying goa. in order to assess the utility of the v <dig>  goa for exploratory enrichment analysis, we compared the arabidopsis and physcomitrella goas to test whether we could reproduce lineage-specific expansions previously discovered using phylogenetic and phylogenomics approaches . in comparison to a. thaliana, gene families like flagellum associated dyneins  <cit> , the light harvesting  superfamily including chlorophyll a/b binding proteins and early light-inducible proteins  <cit> , histidine kinases and response regulators  <cit> , phenylalanine ammonia lyases  and aldehyde dehydrogenases , are expanded in p. patens. comparison of the underlying gene lists of the terms identified by go enrichment analysis with those of the phylogenetic studies reveals that these specific expansions are also reflected by comparing functional annotations using statistical methods.

the go enrichment analysis was performed using topgo with a q-value cut-off < <dig> . depicted are only go terms overrepresented in p. patens and associated with the gene families reported to be expanded in p. patens.

in summary, we improved the go annotation of p. patens gene products in general and demonstrate that the annotation can serve as a solid basis for comparative and exploratory analyses. compared to a. thaliana , where only 7% of all genes have no go annotation, there are still more than 40% of all loci without any go annotation for p. patens, and those with annotation are mainly inferred by electronic annotation . while a significant fraction of this 40% probably comprises orphan genes, special focus should be placed on the improvement of the functional annotation of the p. patens protein-coding genes to unravel its full potential as a reference model organism. to facilitate such efforts we developed the cosmoss.org community annotation interface to browse and alter the p. patens annotation  discussed below.

gene families
gene families  were retrieved by clustering a multitude of sequences of archaeplastida proteins  using orthomcl  <cit> . parameters were optimized as described in methods to target archaeplastida gene families sensu strictu, i.e. families of genes that evolved by speciation and duplications after the divergence of the red/green lineage from a single gene in the last common ancestor. multi-gene or superfamilies thus are split across multiple clusters. the number of p. patens loci in clusters is  <dig> , while after the subtraction of the annotated number of  <dig>  protein-coding loci,  <dig> fall into multiple clusters. some of these cases are due to fragmentary or false structure predictions caused by fusion of two or more distinct gene loci into a single locus and will be resolved in future.

strikingly, 48% of all p. patens loci are in physcomitrella-only clusters , which independently supports an analysis based on protein domains where 52% of all p. patens genes have no pfam domain  <cit> . further filtering of these loci including blastp against genpept and est support indicates that ~22%  of all loci in physcomitrella-only clusters have no detectable homolog, while at least ~13%  have no homolog but transcript evidence. these genes might represent true orphan genes, representing species- or lineage-specific adaptive innovations or non-protein-coding genes. the remainder falls into  <dig> clusters with at least one other viridiplantae protein . thus, a prominent part of the p. patens gene complement could not be clustered with other plant proteins. in part, this could be explained by remaining fragmentary gene predictions and non-protein-coding genes. this is supported by the observation that the average transcript length of these p. patens-only singleton genes is less than 500 bp and the average number of exons is only two . however, at least 40%  of these p. patens-only singleton genes have transcript evidence. approximately two-thirds of all genes are in small clusters with less than three p. patens members. as already observed in the draft genome  <cit> , several gene families are expanded by comparison to flowering plants. in total  <dig> orthomcl clusters are shared by p. patens and a. thaliana containing  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, respectively. reported expansions in gene families  <cit> , like lhcs , dyneins, histidine kinases and response regulators are also reflected by orthomcl cluster sizes . the majority of expanded families are in orthomcl clusters with more than five members in moss.

analysis of intron-loss and gain in the green lineage
similar to 5’-utrs, where we observe a striking number of multi-exon regions in moss, the overall number of single-exon transcripts is remarkable. while chlamydomonas and volvox contain fewer than 10% single-exon transcripts , this fraction is on average ~19% in other land plants, while moss possesses  <dig> %. this may be due either to fragmentary gene predictions and residual non-protein coding genes, or may reflect secondaryintron losses.it has been observed that introns and their positions are highly conserved during land plant evolution  <cit> . in a. thaliana and o. sativa intron losses outnumber intron gains  <cit> . furthermore, there is evidence for secondary intron loss; e.g. a moss sedoheptulose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  gene which lost six out of seven introns  <cit> . such intron losses might account for the relatively high percentage of single-exon genes in p. patens. one suggested mechanism for intron loss involves the reverse transcription of an mrna followed by the  replacement of the genomic dna copy by an intron-less cdna via homologous recombination, called retrocopying  <cit> . an increased rate of intron loss might thus be facilitated by the extraordinarily high rate of dna repair by homologous recombination in p. patens. this hypothesis is based on models proposing a prominent role of gene conversion and dna repair in intron loss  <cit> .

based on shared gene families the extent of secondary intron loss can estimated. there are  <dig> clusters with single-exon moss genes that have multi-exon homologs in other viridiplantae. about half of them  contain also moss paralogs with exons in the same cluster. as some of these might be due to fragmentary gene models, we excluded models from the analysis that are significantly shorter than the median transcript lengths of non-physcomitrella cluster members. a stringent way to define intron loss is to consider the median number of exons found in genes of other species in the same cluster. based on these criteria, we find evidence for secondary loss of introns in about 14%  of all p. patens genes .

about 3%  of the p. patens genes seem to have lost their introns entirely, i.e. are of putative retrocopy origin, which is in the range of the other land plants . the extension of the analysis to arabidopsis, rice and chlamydomonas supports the findings from the comparison of absolute numbers of single-exon genes between algae and land plants described in the previous sections. the alga has significantly less  single-exon genes than the three land plants  under study. one likely scenario is an increased activity of transposons resulting in a secondary, maybe more recent, intron gain in algae  <cit> . this view is supported by the observation that intron positions are often not conserved between the two algae and the land plants . considering the comparable rate of intron loss in plant gene families, the fact that the total number of multi-exon transcripts in p. patens is similar to vascular plants, that only 60% of the  <dig> single exon models are supported by expression evidence, and that more than half of these transcripts are shorter than 500 bp , leads us to conclude that a significant number of the predicted single exon genes represent fragmentary predictions, non-protein coding genes or pseudogenes.

gene family size evolution in viridiplantae
we compared gene family size distributions along the green lineage by looking at all clusters containing p. patens and at least one other viridiplantae species . this analysis revealed that protein families with two to six members are more frequent in p. patens than in the other viridiplantae , supporting the previously hypothesized balanced retention of paralogs that act as pseudoalleles in a haploid-dominant land plant  <cit> . this is most pronounced in clusters with two members, which amount to 27% in p. patens while being substantially less frequent in the other green organisms. in total,  <dig> clusters point to an expansion in p. patens in comparison to the other viridiplantae.  <dig> of these p. patens gene families are more than twice the size of their largest green lineage counterpart.

among these expansions house-keeping and metabolic gene functions are most prominent, independently supporting analyses of paralogs retained after the proposed whole genome duplication event ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and of the unique presence of identical tandemly-arrayed genes  <cit> . prominent examples of this expanded category of genes are abundantly expressed components of multimeric protein complexes like the ribosome and proteasome. in total,  <dig> of the clusters represent the different abundantly expressed protein components of the ribosome. on average these harbor ~ <dig>  times more genes in p. patens than in a. thaliana. for the  <dig> clusters representing structural components of the proteasome we observed on average  <dig>  times the gene complement of arabidopsis in the moss. these expansions are also detectable in the functional comparison of the two species using go enrichment analysis .

in addition, families encoding for smaller complexes and monomers are expanded, including the light harvesting complex ii  major antenna, ribulose- <dig>  5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase  small subunit, toc <dig>  and components of the splicing and translation machineries.

the expansion of house-keeping and metabolic gene functions is also mirrored by the findings of the go enrichment analysis comparing p. patens and a. thaliana , which revealed an increased complement of genes involved in translation, oxidation-reduction, electron transport, microtubule based movement, glycolysis, and atp synthesis. additionally, specific expansions occurred which might represent lineage-/species-specific adaptations  proteins, early response to dehydration  proteins, cationic peroxidases) and in enriched go “biological process” annotations . some of these enriched categories like “ciliary or flagellar motility”, which can be explained by the absence of flagellated sperm in flowering plants, confirm the findings of previous analyses  <cit> . the majority of the above listed categories and families  represents true novel insights which will help to unravel the much-cited qualities of the mosses in coping with abiotic and biotic stressors like their unique ability to repair dna damage  <cit> .

extension of the cosmoss.org resource to provide a permanent, central model organism database and annotation repository for p. patens
protein-coding gene models were clustered to loci and the resulting locus definitions were used to derive information-rich locus identifiers .

with the development of genonaut  <cit> , we have extended cosmoss.org by the capability to annotate physcomitrella patens genes with regard to gene name, product name, description, and gene ontology  terms. the interface which allows searching, browsing and editing of annotation is modular and can be extended to support additional  annotations as gene features. traceability of annotations in terms of author and experimental evidence is crucial for quality assessment of information retrieval. thus, the genonaut interface accepts the alteration of an existing gene description only if the source is specified. integration of multiple sources into a unique abstraction layer is achieved by assigning unique and permanent cosmoss reference ids  to author statements from all sources. the highest quality author statements are experimental evidence provided as references to peer-reviewed publications. the easiest way to achieve this is to provide a valid pubmed id and the system automatically retrieves all relevant information from ncbi pubmed. if the source is a publication that is not tracked in pubmed, a custom reference can be created. if no publication is available, as the “weakest” possible evidence, a note in form of a text comment or web link describing the evidence is required. besides the references the genonaut interface allows to link to other resources via database cross-references .

the gene products can be further annotated using go terms. to allow convenient manual goa, the genonaut interface assists the annotator by allowing the user to browse the appropriate go namespace by keywords to assign the correct terms. in addition to the mandatory reference for a genonaut annotation, we have integrated the assignment of the go evidence codes  <cit> . in this way the quality of each assigned go term is directly discernible. as traceability is crucial for the maintenance of annotation quality, the genonaut system traces every annotation change using a history system. thus it is possible to trace changes and possibly revert to a previous state if needed, but more importantly to comprehend the annotation history of every gene and annotation version.

whereas the annotation browser capabilities are publicly available, the editor functions are restricted to registered cosmoss.org users . the cosmoss.org curator team acts as a superior authority which supervises and validates the user provided annotations by direct personal communication.

moreover, the genonaut interface provides a starting point to retrieve detailed annotation about p. patens protein-coding genes. besides the possibility to search and edit the annotations and annotation history, the genonaut interface is linked to the sequence retrieval, genome browser and sequence viewer providing transcript and protein domain annotations.

to support the manual curation of gene structures we have integrated and adapted the apollo structural gene annotation editor  <cit>  for the cosmoss.org genome browser. generated user_models  are assigned cgis  from the user model namespace extended using the authors username to allow multiple versions per locus .

CONCLUSIONS
here we describe the complete re-annotation of the p. patens v <dig> genome assembly comprising structural and functional annotation of protein-coding genes and, for the first time, description of non-protein loci including trna, rrna, mirna, snorna and snrna loci. compared to v <dig>  the improved structural annotation v <dig>  resulted in  <dig> additional protein-coding loci,  <dig>  more complete genes and only  <dig> unaltered gene structures. 70% of the  <dig>  protein-coding genes are supported by est evidence. nearly half  of the protein-coding loci in v <dig>  are now be considered complete, containing both utrs. furthermore, the information-rich cosmoss.org locus ids also carry information on the chromosomal/scaffold localization and about alternative splicing of transcripts.

we significantly increased the number of genes with functional annotations  in form of go term annotations . our quality assessment of the v <dig>  goa demonstrates sufficient annotation depth to recover results from previous high-quality phylogeny-based approaches using ontology term enrichment analysis. nevertheless, there are still 41% of all loci without any go annotation and only  <dig> % of all assigned go terms are supported by direct experimental evidence. although this is a common phenomenon for most available plant genomes, special focus needs to be placed on the improvement of the functional annotation of the p. patens protein-coding genes in order for it to serve as a reference model organism and plant “flagship”. with the development of the cosmoss.org community annotation services described here allowing users to browse, view and alter functional and structural annotations of moss genes, transfer and exchange of knowledge is greatly facilitated. including the described extensions of the resource, cosmoss.org now is well-equipped to serve as a permanent, central model organism database and annotation repository for p. patens.

we demonstrate the utility of the provided annotation and resources for the comparative study of plant evolution including the analysis of codon usage , alternative splicing, gene structure evolution as well as the detection of lineage- and species-specific expansions of gene families and biological processes.

results from our comparative analyses were mostly consistent with previous observations, but also provided several novel insights. in particular, we found further evidence for intron loss during land plant evolution and secondary intron gain in the alga chlamydomonas. investigation of alternative splicing and gene structures revealed a unique complexity of 5’-utrs in the moss, pointing to the importance of utrs for the regulation of gene expression in this early diverging land plant.

our comparative analysis of functional annotations and protein clusters revealed expansions of moss house-keeping and metabolic gene functions as well as hitherto unknown lineage-specific expansions. in total,  <dig> gene clusters are expanded in p. patens and at least ~13% of all gene loci are orphan genes as they have no homolog in other as yet published genomes. subsequent functional analysis of this data set will further extend our understanding of the unique capabilities to cope with abiotic and biotic stressors and to efficiently repair dna damage.
