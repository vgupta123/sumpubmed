BACKGROUND
gene expression within the realm of time and space is a hallmark ensuring the morphogenesis, development and sustenance of an organism. based on tissue specific expression profile, often structure-function relationship is established. a set of genes reportedly involved in regulating shape and orientation during the early embryonic development are assisted by hox family genes
 <cit> . the hox family genes have been characterized in the context of pattern formation from drosophila to homo sapiens. in human,  <dig> hox genes organized into four distinct clusters  are located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively
 <cit> . each cluster in turn is composed of 9– <dig> closely related genes giving rise to distinct paralogs and often, although not always, have overlapping functions. these paralogs arranged in a collinear manner are successively activated, from ‘head’ to ‘tail’ orchestrating sequential expression thus, regulating development
 <cit> 
.

hox genes from insect to model vertebrate species have been studied to explore its organizational and functional status during embryonic development
 <cit> . in the mouse embryo, hoxc <dig> mrna expression has been observed predominantly in posterior regions especially in the hind limbs, kidney and developing genitalia
 <cit> . of all the hox family genes studied thus far, due attention has not be given to the members of 5′ region, particularly hoxc <dig> 

the hox genes encode transcription factors that contain a segment of conserved polypeptide designated as homeodomain which controls the formation of anterioposterior  body axis
 <cit> . most of the homeodomains are  <dig> amino acids in length . the homeodomain makes major groove contact, via helix turn helix motif, and minor groove contacts, via the n-terminal arm of the homeodomain with dna
 <cit> . studies have demonstrated that hox genes harbor overlapping domains of expression in the developing embryos
 <cit> . only a few homeotic response elements  have been characterized at the molecular level
 <cit> . the presence of multiple binding sites in homre can influence dna-binding specificity by facilitating cooperative homeotic protein interactions. the identification of the functional domains of hox gene products depends on the physiological context in which the hox protein interacts with the target dna. hox proteins have been demonstrated to act as positive or negative regulators of the transcriptional activity of very specific target in the cultured embryos
 <cit> . consequently, hox proteins play a crucial role in maintaining cell differentiation and proliferation across the species
. their expression has been observed in oocytes and early embryos of human, mouse, porcine and bovine
. however, expression of hoxc <dig> protein in adult animals still remains a subject of investigation. notwithstanding such information available on this line, strange it may seem, no attempt has been made to uncover possible interacting residues within the homeodomain of hoxc <dig> protein. similarly, no information is available on the distribution of this protein within the cell systems in adult animals.

buffalo is an economically important livestock species in the indian sub-continent and south asian countries
 <cit> . we characterized hoxc <dig> protein from water buffalo bubalus bubalis focusing particularly on its tissue specific expression, demonstrating its localization in the nuclei and finally deducing its putative 3d structure. prospects of the present study in the context of biological relevance of hoxc <dig> protein are highlighted.

hoxc <dig> interacts with ce-lph <dig> element of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase  gene promoter
emsa was performed with recombinant hoxc <dig> protein to assess the protein interaction with lph promoter. the binding of hoxc <dig> with lph promoter in the presence of specific anti-hoxc <dig> antibodies resulted in reduced mobility of the protein-dna complex. consequently, a supershift was seen . whereas, bsa used as a non-competitor for lph failed to form such complex and therefore no shift was observed. thus, the data confirms strong interaction of buffalo hoxc <dig> protein with the lph promoter.figure  <dig>

discussion
hox genes are found in majority of the species owing to their ardent requirement for pattern formation
 <cit> . hoxc <dig> protein isolated and purified herein emitted tryptophan spectra at 330 nm revealing the hitherto buried nature of tryptophan residues and their presence in the non-polar environment
 <cit> . further, in silico analysis and cd spectra indicated the predominance of α helices encompassing  <dig> % of the total hoxc <dig> protein. the expression of hoxc <dig> protein has been reported in mouse embryonic tissues like kidney, prostatic urethra, femur, pelvis and gut
 <cit> . hoxc <dig> protein was localized earlier in the nucleus of t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
 <cit> . we localized the hoxc <dig> protein in the nuclei of gonads and different somatic tissues of buffalo employing immunohistochemistry approach. subsequent western blot analysis showed the highest expression of hoxc <dig> protein in kidney, followed by lung and spleen. based on the high expression of hoxc <dig>  we construe its involvement in renal, respiratory and immunological activities.

the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase  gene is known to express in the enterocytes of the small intestine
 <cit> . studies on immunoprecipated human lactase have demonstrated the enzymatic activities against lactose, phlorizin and several glycopeptides. thus, it is reasonable to expect that the mechanism of this genetic switch is common to all the species. in rats and rabbits, lactase activity is reportedly higher during the neonatal stages which, gradually decreases towards the adulthood
. several reports have indicated the down-regulation of lph activity in mammals at the transcriptional level, however, subsequent post-transcriptional mechanisms may also play modifying roles
. the binding of cdx- <dig>  with lph elements in caco- <dig> cells has been reported
 <cit> . in the present study, electrophoretic mobility shift assay  showed a similar binding affinity of buffalo hoxc <dig> protein with the promoter element of lph gene. this corroborates the earlier work highlighting potential role in regulating the activation of lph
 <cit>  and thereby its intestinal functions in adult buffalo.

predicting the role of orthologues separated over a long span of time has been a difficult proposition, especially in the context of the multidomain proteins with frequent insertions/deletions. accordingly, the biological functions of six domains of hoxc <dig> protein such as duf <dig>  homeodomain, cog, pha, kgd and prk are still unclear. in silico analysis of hoxc <dig> amino acid sequence showed the presence of duf <dig> and homeodomain superfamilies. however, function of duf <dig> superfamily is also not yet established. interestingly, all the subunits showed high degree of conservation across the species conferring intactness of each domain. high degree  of hoxc <dig> amino acid sequence conservation across the species indicates more generalized and mandatory biological roles of this protein in higher eukaryotes. our study seems to be the first attempt in predicting the three dimensional structure of buffalo hoxc <dig> protein. the hoxc <dig> transcription factors containing a highly conserved polypeptide segment, the homeodomain, functions by directly binding with the regulatory regions. this in turn initiates the transcription of other developmental genes
 <cit> . thus, owing to its conservation in human and non-human systems, the fate of hoxc <dig> protein may be studied in human renal, respiratory and immunological impairments to highlight its clinical relevance.

CONCLUSIONS
higher expression of hoxc <dig> protein in kidney and lung reflects its possible tissue specific functions. similarly, interaction of hoxc <dig> with lactase-phlorizin hydrolase  promoter suggests its possible role in intestinal functions. detection of fifteen interacting residues within the homeodomain of hoxc <dig> protein enriches its structure-function relationship. present study opens up newer avenues for gaining deeper understanding on the actions and mechanisms of hoxc <dig> protein in regulating expression of other genes having possible clinical relevance.
