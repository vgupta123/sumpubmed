BACKGROUND
members of the signal regulatory protein family  play important roles in the regulation of the immune response in man  <cit> . the family comprises three type i transmembrane glycoproteins  each with an extracellular region consisting of three ig-like domains followed by a single transmembrane sequence and a cytoplasmic domain which varies in length between the three sirps. sirps are classified as “paired receptors” since they show the following characteristics:  they are encoded by different genes arranged in a gene cluster,  they share significant sequence homology in their extracellular domains and  they comprise both activating and inhibitory members. thus sirpα delivers an inhibitory signal via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs  located in the cytoplasmic domain of the protein as well as interacting with the ligand cd <dig>  <cit> . sirpβ delivers an activating signal through association with dap <dig>  a transmembrane adaptor protein with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif , but does not bind to cd <dig>  <cit> . by contrast, sirpγ appears to have no signaling function but does bind to cd <dig>  though this interaction is ten times weaker than that of sirpα  <cit> . unlike the other sirp proteins, sirpγ is expressed by t cells where it interacts with cd <dig> on the surface of the cell, resulting in increased cell-cell adhesion in an integrin-independent manner  <cit> . therefore, it is thought that sirpγ may be involved in t cell responses as an accessory protein  <cit> . note, sirpγ was originally called sirpβ <dig> but this term is no longer used  <cit> .

there has been considerable interest in the structure of the sirp family with regard to the subtle differences in ligand binding specificity  <cit>  and a putative relationship to primitive antigen receptors  <cit> . crystal structures have been determined for the n terminal domains of sirpα  <cit> , sirpβ and sirpγ  <cit> , a full extracellular region of sirpα  <cit>  and a complex of the n-terminal domain of sirpα and cd <dig>  <cit> .

in this paper we present the x-ray crystal structure of the complete extracellular portion of sirpγ co-crystallized with the fab fragment of the ox <dig> monoclonal antibody, which recognises sirpα, sirpβ and sirpγ  <cit> . the fab fragments of antibodies have been used extensively as co-crystallization chaperones  <cit>  and binding to fab fragments of ox <dig> facilitated the crystallization of sirpγ in this study. the eptiope recognised by ox <dig> involved residues in both domains  <dig> and  <dig>  of sirpγ and was distinct from the cd <dig> binding site on d <dig>  interestingly, sirpγ formed a dimer in the crystal structure through an interface between d <dig> and d <dig> 

RESULTS
overall structure
in contrast to sirpα  <cit> , attempts to grow diffraction quality crystals of the full three domain extracellular region of sirpγ proved unsuccessful. therefore an antibody chaperone approach was adopted using the fab fragment of a sirp monoclonal antibody  that had previously been generated  <cit> . both fab fragments of ox <dig> and the extracellular region of sirpγ were produced as recombinant proteins in mammalian cells. diffracting crystals of the fabox117: sirpγ complex were successfully obtained following de-glycosylation of the sirpγ: fabox <dig> protein complex using endoglycosidase f <dig>  the structure of the complex was solved to  <dig>  Å resolution by molecular replacement. the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a sirpγ dimer, with each sirpγ monomer bound to a fabox <dig> . the final refined model has a r-factor of  <dig>   with root mean square deviations  of  <dig>  Å for bond lengths and  <dig> ° for bond angles from the ideal values. the c-terminal end of d <dig> of sirpγ is flexible, residues 294– <dig> and 317– <dig> in one molecule, and residues 232– <dig>  289– <dig> and 316– <dig> in another are not defined in the electron density map and not included in the model. the two sirpγ molecules can be superimposed with a rmsd of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> equivalent cα atoms, while the rmsd is  <dig>  Å for  <dig> equivalent cα atoms between the two fabox <dig> molecules. of the  <dig> potential glycosylation sites in each sirpγ molecule, one at residue  <dig> has sufficient density allowing the n-linked n-acetylglucosamine to be modelled; weak electron density attached to residue  <dig> suggests the presence of glycosylation. there is no evidence in the electron density map for the modification at asn <dig> and asn <dig>  which contrasts with the observations reported for the structure of sirpα  <cit> . the c-terminal his <dig> tag from one of the fab heavy chains is ordered, presumably due to crystal contacts. two his residues, at position  <dig> and  <dig>  together with a water molecule and his <dig> from a symmetry related sirpγ bind a zinc ion with the canonical tetrahedral coordination.

the fab binding site
from the structure it can be seen that the antibody fab fragment binds to both d <dig> and d <dig> of sirpγ . the light chain variable region  appears to be inserted between the two domains contacting residues in both d <dig> and d <dig>  whereas the heavy chain variable domain  only interacts with d <dig>  comparison of bound and unbound fabox <dig>  shows only small changes in conformation upon binding . alignment using pdbefold  <cit>  of the fd region  gives a rmsd of  <dig>  Å for the cα backbone for  <dig> out of  <dig> residues. regions of the fd fragment that were disordered in the unbound fab structure, namely the vh loop consisting of residues g <dig> to s <dig> and the c-terminal residues  <dig> to  <dig> become ordered on binding to the antigen. for the light chain the rmsd for the cα backbone is  <dig>  Å for  <dig> out of  <dig> residues. the most significant conformational change in fabox <dig> upon binding to sirpγ is the re-positioning of the side-chain of r <dig> in the third complementarity determining region  of vh . r <dig> forms a network of hydrogen bonds with sirpγ d <dig> involving q <dig> and e <dig> in the loop connecting β-strands a <dig> and a <dig> and g <dig> in the g1/g <dig> loop . additional hydrogen bond interactions between fabox <dig> and sirpγ are observed between y <dig> in vl cdr <dig> and k <dig> and l <dig> in the a1/a <dig> loop of sirpγ and between s <dig> of vl cdr <dig> and d <dig> in d <dig> of sirpγ. all these residues are conserved between sirpα, β and γ indicating that ox <dig> would bind in a similar way to all three sirps, consistent with the cross-reactivity data previously published for this antibody  <cit> .

the structure of the isolated d <dig> domain of sirpγ has been solved previously . overlaying this structure onto the full length sirpγ, showed that binding of the fab fragment to d <dig> did not change the conformation of the domain. thus alignment of the two d <dig> structures gave a rmsd for the cα backbone of  <dig>  Å for 109/ <dig> amino acids, with the loop comprising g <dig> to e <dig> becoming ordered in the complex. overall, binding of the fabox <dig> to sirpγ appears to result in very little conformational change in either the antibody or antigen.

the crystal structure of d <dig> of sirpα in complex with cd <dig> has been solved by hatherley et al.  <cit> . when the d <dig> of the fabox117: sirpγ crystal structure is aligned with the sirpα: cd <dig> structure , the locations where fab and cd <dig> bind to sirpγ do not overlap . the main contact residues for cd <dig> are in three loops connecting strands b2-c, d-e and f-g <dig>  this suggests that sirpγ could bind both fabox <dig> and cd <dig> at the same time.

comparison of sirpγ with sirpα
comparison of the full length extracellular three domain structure of sirpγ with that of sirpα  shows a high level of structural similarity for the individual domains  . one small difference is the relative length of the c’ and d strands in the d <dig> domains which are short and long respectively in sirpγ and the opposite in sirpα, though this does not alter the overall topology of the d <dig> domains . however, there is a significant difference in the relative orientation of the three domains between the two sirp structures . thus, in the superimposition of d <dig> of sirpγ onto the d <dig> of sirpα , the d2-d <dig> domains of the two proteins are rotated by 66° with respect to each other . the difference in the relative arrangement of d <dig> and d2-d <dig> in the two sirps would affect the ability of sirpα to bind to fabox <dig> since the interactions between fabox <dig> vl and d <dig> observed in sirpγ would not be possible in the sirpα structure shown in figure  <dig> . this suggests that there is some flexibility in the d1-d <dig> inter-domain region as ox <dig> has previously been shown to bind to all three sirps  <cit> .

interestingly, in contrast to the structure of sirpα alone  <cit> , the two sirpγ molecules bound to fabox <dig> formed a head-to head dimer in the crystal structure  with a contact area of about 1130 Å <dig> and a complex formation significance score  <cit>  of  <dig> . this is at the lower end of the range considered to be physiological significant   <cit>  though it is comparable to the contact surface area  and significance score  for the sirpγ: fab interface. it therefore appears to be non-trivial. the two sirpγ molecules form an arch-like structure spanning a distance of approximately 160 Å with the fab fragments binding to the outer surface of the arch . dimer formation appears to be a consequence of the relative orientation of d <dig> with respect to d <dig> which is imposed by the fab binding. the interface between the two sirpγ chains comprises a number of hydrogen-bond interactions between residues in d <dig> and d <dig>  e.g. t88-d <dig>  l114-s <dig>  e111-g <dig> and a salt bridge r180-e <dig> . six of these interface residues are conserved between all three sirp sequences, with the other two showing relatively conservative substitutions .

analysis of the sirpγ: fabox <dig> complex by analytical ultracentrifugation
the observation that sirpγ is dimeric in the crystal, poses the question as to whether this self-association occurs in solution. sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out on both sirpγ and fabox <dig> proteins individually. experimentally determined sedimentation coefficients, frictional ratios and molecular weights were compared to values calculated from the coordinates of their crystal structures using us-somo  <cit>  . the results showed that sirpγ was monodisperse and behaved as a monomer. a single species was also observed for fabox <dig> which corresponded to the assembled light and heavy chain. sedimentation velocity experiments of a 2: <dig> stoichiometric mixture of sirpγ: fabox <dig> gave two peaks at  <dig>  s and  <dig>  s . the first peak was consistent with the calculated and measured value for sirpγ alone, whilst the second peak corresponded to the sedimentation coefficient calculated for a 1: <dig> complex of sirpγ and fabox <dig> . a 1: <dig> mixture of sirpγ and fabox <dig> gave a single skewed distribution around a sedimentation coefficient of  <dig>  s , close to that determined for the 1: <dig> complex. we interpret this result as follows: under the conditions where there is a two-fold molar excess of the fabox <dig> over the sirpγ protein, a 1: <dig> complex with sirpγ is formed, which partially dissociates during sedimentation. since the free fabox <dig> has a similar sedimentation coefficient to the fabox117: sirpγ complex  there is no resolution of the bound and unbound fabox <dig> into individual peaks, and a skewed composite peak observed. however the sedimentation coefficient of sirpγ alone is sufficiently different from the complex  that a peak corresponding to the sirpγ alone can be resolved . the theoretical basis for this behaviour has been described previously by cann, winzor and co-workers  <cit> ). nonetheless, if the sirpγ: fabox <dig> formed a 2: <dig> complex, as observed in the crystal structure, then a species sedimenting at  <dig>  s would be expected . however no such higher order species were observed in any of the sedimentation velocity experiments.

to assess the strength of the sirpγ: fabox <dig> interaction, sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiments were carried out on 2: <dig>  1: <dig> and 1: <dig> stoichiometric mixtures of sirpγ: fabox <dig>  data were extracted using sedfit v <dig>   <cit>  and processed with sedphat  <cit> . the results did not fit a single species model indicating that multiple forms were present in solution . however, the data fitted well to an a + b ↔ ab model. from this model the derived dissociation constant was determined to be  <dig>   μm, indicating only a moderately strong antibody: antigen interaction. such a value would also explain the behaviour of the sedimentation velocity profiles seen in figure 4a, since at the loading concentration used, there would be a small amount of dissociation into individual components giving rise to skewed peaks in the c plot .

we conclude that the 2: <dig> sirp: fabox <dig> complex observed in the crystal structure is not formed in solution under the conditions of the auc experiments. it is important to note that the highest protein concentration of the sirpγ: fabox <dig> mixture used in the auc experiments was 1 mg/ml  compared to  <dig>  mg/ml  for crystallization. therefore it is possible that the 2: <dig> complex predominates at high concentrations of the sirpγ fabox <dig> mixture. however we calculate that this would require that the dissociation constant of the 2: <dig> complex is </= 10 μm. if this was the case then it is surprising that no 2: <dig> complex was observed at the concentration of  <dig>  μm used in the sedimentation velocity experiments. the results of the auc analyses imply that self-association of sirp γ only occurs, if at all, at very high protein concentrations and therefore is unlikely to be physiologically relevant.

CONCLUSIONS
a cross-reactive anti-sirp monoclonal antibody  has proved useful in crystallizing human sirpγ and subsequently obtaining the structure of the antibody: antigen complex. this has enabled the cross-reactive epitope to be mapped to the first and second domains of sirpγ distal from the cd <dig> ligand binding site on domain  <dig>  the structure of the fabox117: sirpγ complex has also revealed the potential for sirps to form head-to-head dimers through an interaction between the domains  <dig> and  <dig> on adjacent molecules in the crystal. however this interaction was not observed in solution, so its physiological significance is questionable. comparison of the three domain structures of sirpγ and sirpα showed that these receptors can adopt different overall conformations due to the flexibility of the linker between the first two domains. given the sequence similarity between all members of the sirp family it seems likely that this is a property shared by all of the receptors.
