BACKGROUND
chromosomal duplications influence adaptive processes by potentially impacting on either short-term or long-term evolutionary outcomes. in the short term, duplications may confer higher fitness owing to increased gene dosage  <cit> . indeed, they overcome limited expression of specific functions when microbial populations evolve for instance under conditions of lactose limitation in escherichia coli <cit> , glucose limitation in yeast  <cit> , or antibiotic pressure in salmonella <cit> . moreover, the flexibility associated with the potential transient nature of duplication events may provide evolutionary advantages in fluctuating environments or relaxed selection  <cit> . over longer evolution, duplication events can enhance survival abilities by buffering against deleterious mutations  <cit> . they may also provide important pathways to genetic innovation, opening opportunities for the emergence of novel functions and the expansion of gene families  <cit> . genome sequences have confirmed the contribution of dna duplications to evolutionary processes  <cit> . gene duplication may be related to evolutionary divergence  <cit>  by providing intermediates during the duplication-divergence process  <cit> . different models have been proposed to identify the selective forces for gene duplication, including a neutral event followed by accumulation of mutations  <cit> , the evolution of intermediates with secondary functions  <cit> , and complementary loss-of-functions in each of the duplicated copies  <cit> . chromosomal duplication is associated with the potential for increased genetic variation that may result in an equilibrium between organismal robustness against deleterious mutations and evolvability with potentially beneficial mutations that may arise in a copy of a duplicated region, thereby contributing to evolved phenotypes.

most information on evolution through duplication relies on retrospective comparative analyses of available genomes  <cit> . however, direct observation of the rise and segregation of duplications is much scarcer owing to their rarity, instability and the subtle phenotypic effects they may confer. bacterial evolution experiments  <cit>  provide opportunities to identify intermediates during duplication processes. however, only few duplication events have been detected in these experiments, except during high temperature adaptation  <cit>  where evolved clones contained on average  <dig>  large duplication compared to  <dig>  snps and short indels  <cit> . most mutations identified during laboratory evolution experiments include snps and short indels  <cit>  that have been shown to explain many evolved phenotypes. consequently, little information is available over short time-frames on the dynamics of duplication processes, including the divergence of duplicated copies. hence, to the best of our knowledge, no data with co-linear wild-type and mutant alleles are available during evolution experiments, whereas duplications have been commonly found by classical genetics in salmonella populations adapting to diverse conditions including nutrient-limited chemostats  <cit> .

we designed evolution experiments during which an e. coli ancestral strain was propagated as large populations  for ~ <dig> generations within chemostats under glucose or phosphate limitation  <cit> . chemostats are continuous culture systems in which the bacteria deplete substrates but are maintained in constant population numbers over extended periods. mutations improve fitness in this environment, allowing population sweeps. the initial selection is for better utilization  of limiting nutrient but, after ~ <dig> generations, populations diversify into separate lineages with diverse phenotypes and eventually evolve cross-feeding polymorphisms  <cit> . many snps, deletions, is movements and short indels have been identified that explained the functional changes that occurred in different phenotypic groups  <cit> . however, the genetic bases of the metabolic changes and fitness benefits of some groups of clones have not yet been identified. in particular, one group of clones producing unusually elevated acetate levels and reduced growth yield is not characterized by the typical improved glucose transport  <cit>  and lacks all the regulatory changes identified so far in other clones from the same populations  <cit> .

here, we combined insertion sequence-based restriction length polymorphism, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and genome re-sequencing to characterize one representative of this group of clones. we identified a novel chromosomal duplication, one copy of which was altered by a deletion that conferred higher fitness under the conditions prevailing in the chemostat. this duplication may constitute an evolutionary intermediate  <cit> . hence, the duplication is readily resolved into a single copy, either ancestral or evolved, the resolution frequency being higher under non-selective conditions. owing to its instability, we had difficulties to detect the duplication by genome re-sequencing. hence, we missed the duplication during a first genome re-sequencing attempt of the focal clone. only the discrepancy between the data generated by our combined approaches led us to carefully re-examine the genome and to identify the duplication. this instability may explain the under-representation of large duplications observed during laboratory bacterial evolution experiments.

RESULTS
initial characterization of bw4005
the evolved clone bw <dig> was previously characterized phenotypically by comparison to its ancestor, and exhibited a lower growth yield, a higher production of acetate from glucose in chemostat culture, and a lack of obvious difference in glucose uptake  <cit> . at the ecological level, bw <dig> was present in low proportion in its glucose-limited evolving population and displayed negative frequency-dependent fitness when competed with the ancestor  <cit> . by contrast, no genetic information was available to explain these phenotypic and ecological traits, even after re-sequencing the genome of a clone, called bw <dig> , recovered from the initial glycerol stock of bw <dig>  by using a combination of  <dig> and illumina technologies. indeed, we detected a single mutation compared to the ancestor, consisting of a short deletion in ahpc encoding the alkyl hydroperoxide subunit involved in peroxide resistance . as shown below, this mutation did not contribute to increased fitness in the chemostats. moreover, the genome sequence of bw <dig>  was inconsistent with previously detected changes in the rflp profiles of another clone isolated independently from the same glycerol stock of bw <dig>  called bw <dig> , using the mobile genetic element is <dig> as a probe  <cit> . indeed, while the rflp-is <dig> profile of the ancestral strain bw <dig> revealed four is3-containing ecorv genomic fragments of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  kb, respectively, with hybridization intensities proportional to the relative molecular weight of these fragments , the one of bw <dig>  showed a fifth hybridizing fragment of ~ <dig>  kb with a hybridization intensity stronger than expected from its molecular weight . this was unlikely to be due to contamination, since both clones harbored the ahpc mutation .

athe positions are given according to the genome sequence of the ancestor strain bw <dig>  <cit> . bthe genome sequence of bw <dig>  was first obtained and detected only the first mutation, while the one of bw <dig> c <dig> was obtained afterwards and contained the three mutations. cnot applicable.

genomic rearrangements in bw4005
we characterized the genomic sequences adjacent to is <dig> in the  <dig> -kb fragment specific to bw <dig>  by inverse pcr experiments. one side  corresponded to the gatd gene with the is <dig> insertion at exactly the same position  as observed in the ancestor for the is <dig> element contained in the  <dig> -kb hybridizing fragment. this particular ancestral is <dig> is inserted between positions  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  the other side corresponded to a genomic sequence  located  <dig> bp upstream in the ancestral genome. therefore, this fifth is <dig> probably resulted from an is <dig> transposition event at position  <dig> , <dig> followed by a recombination event between this new is <dig> copy and the one located in the ancestral genome between positions  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> within gatd. these events subsequently resulted in the 2668-bp deletion of the intervening fragment, affecting the two genes yegr and yegs and part of ogrk . however, two features of the rflp-is <dig> pattern suggested a more complex rearrangement : the two  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb is3-hybridizing fragments were co-existing in bw <dig> , indicating the presence of two copies of at least gatd, and the  <dig>  kb fragment presented a hybridizing intensity higher than expected from its molecular weight compared to the four other hybridizing fragments. altogether, these data might be explained by the presence in the chromosome of bw <dig>  of a tandem duplication containing two heterozygous copies, with and without the is3-generated deletion respectively . we then performed pfge experiments with xbai-digested genomic dna of bw <dig> and bw <dig>  . we found two extra xbai fragments of  <dig>  and  <dig> kb in bw <dig>  compared to bw <dig>  which also suggested the presence of a complex rearrangement.

these genomic rearrangements were not detected by genome sequencing in the clone bw <dig> . since both clones bw <dig>  and bw <dig>  were derived from a single cycle of growth after plating the initial glycerol stock of bw <dig> onto lb solid medium, we hypothesized that the rearrangements were present in the original evolved clone, but were characterized by a high instability. we therefore investigated the stability of the genomic rearrangements by isolating six additional clones, called bw <dig> c <dig> to bw <dig> c <dig>  after plating the initial glycerol stock of bw <dig> onto lb medium, and analyzing them by rflp-is <dig> and pfge . the rflp-is <dig> profiles were checked for the presence or absence of the  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb is3-hybridizing fragments. hence, their simultaneous presence was diagnostic of the putative heterozygous duplication while the presence of only the first or second fragment indicated the resolution of the putative duplication into the ancestral or deleted copy, respectively. similarly, the pfge profiles were checked for the presence or absence of the two  <dig>  and  <dig> kb bands. the rflp-is <dig> profiles revealed that four  of the six clones had lost either one of the putative duplicated dna copies , with clones bw <dig> c <dig> and bw <dig> c <dig> harboring the single deleted copy and bw <dig> c <dig> and bw <dig> c <dig> the ancestral copy. the two last clones, bw <dig> c <dig> and bw <dig> c <dig>  retained the putative heterozygous duplication. consistent with the rflp-is <dig> profiles, the pfge analysis showed that clones bw <dig> c <dig> and bw <dig> c <dig> retained only the  <dig> kb band, while bw <dig> c <dig> and bw <dig> c <dig> had the ancestral profile, and bw <dig> c <dig> and bw <dig> c <dig> harbored the two extra fragments . these results indicated the high genetic instability of the putative duplication as well as its capacity for resolution into alternative states.

moreover, both rflp and pfge experiments, using genomic dna isolated from different independent cultures of bw <dig> c <dig>  exhibited variation in the intensity of the additional bands , which further suggested the instability of the genetic rearrangement. this instability may provide an explanation for the discrepancies between the rflp/pfge experiments and the genome re-sequencing results and is considered in more detail below.

characterization of a heterozygous duplication by genome re-sequencing
to address the discrepancies between the different approaches, we decided to re-sequence the genome of bw <dig> c <dig> that harbored the complex rearrangement . we now detected three mutations compared to bw <dig> : the same in-frame 3-bp deletion in ahpc, the 2668-bp deletion of ogrk-yegr-yegs, and a duplication of ~ <dig> kb extending from genomic positions  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig>  the duplicated fragment is localized between two is <dig> elements , and therefore likely resulted from a recombination event between one and the other of these two is <dig> copies during dna replication. we further validated the presence of the duplication by three additional tests: first, we pcr-amplified and sequenced the new junction sequence resulting from the duplication by using the primers frontr and frontf . both the size and sequence of the pcr products confirmed the duplication. second, an additional is5-containing ecorv restriction fragment of  <dig>  kb should be produced at the junction of the duplication  and should therefore be detected by rflp-is <dig>  this was indeed shown to be the case . finally, the pfge profiles with the additional xbai bands were easily explained on the basis of the duplicated genome sequence .

phenotypic effects of the rearrangements
we next investigated the relationships between the complex chromosomal rearrangements and the phenotypes known for bw <dig>  we measured the growth yield, acetate production, and fitness of the three clones bw <dig> c <dig>  bw <dig> c <dig> and bw <dig> c <dig> compared to the ancestor bw <dig>  these three clones are genotypically different : the duplication has been resolved into the deleted or ancestral copy in bw <dig> c <dig> and bw <dig> c <dig>  respectively, while bw <dig> c <dig> contains the heterozygous duplication. as shown in table  <dig>  bw <dig> c <dig> and bw <dig> c <dig> had similar evolved phenotypes , while bw <dig> c <dig> had phenotypic properties similar to the ancestor. these results suggested that the 2668-bp deletion was the main contributor to the bw <dig> evolved phenotypes, and not the ahpc mutation. moreover, the presence of the heterozygous duplication seemed to confer similar phenotypes compared to the 2668-bp deletion alone.

agrowth yields are shown relative to the ancestral strain bw <dig> and were obtained from 24-hour glucose-limited chemostats by measuring the optical density of the cultures at  <dig> nm. values are from three independent measurements.

bacetate production was tested with 24-hour chemostat cultures. +, acetate present at 2– <dig> mg l-1; -, below the detection limit . data were from at least three independent biological repeats with less than 10% standard errors.

ccompeting strains were mixed at 50: <dig> or 1: <dig> ratios after individual acclimation in the chemostat evolution conditions. changes in the proportions of the competitors after  <dig> hours were used to calculate fitness values. data presented are mean ± sem from at least two independent experiments. nd, not determined.

dsymbols are identical to the legend of figure  <dig> 

we next investigated the respective phenotypic contribution of each of the yegr and yegs genes, by first moving the 2668-bp deletion and second inactivating them individually into the ancestral genetic background. we found that both the 2668-bp deletion and yegs-inactivated strains exhibited the evolved phenotypes, while the yegr-inactivated strain had phenotypes indistinguishable from the ancestor .

stability of the duplication
an important unresolved question is whether the duplication itself conferred a benefit under the chemostat selection conditions. since evolved phenotypic attributes were not specifically provided by the duplicated state, we tested this indirectly by comparing the population dynamics of the duplication in two environments: non-selective conditions in lb batch cultures and the glucose-limited chemostat selection environment . the clone bw <dig> c <dig>  harboring the heterozygous duplication, was grown either in lb medium for three 24-hour growth cycles or for three days in chemostats in low-frequency competition with mc <dig> to mimic the evolution experiment . in each case,  <dig> individual clones, sampled at each day interval, were analyzed for the presence of the genomic rearrangements by colony-pcr using the primer pairs is5f1/is5r <dig>  is3f1/is3r <dig>  and is3f1/is3r <dig>  the primer pair is5f1/is5r1was specifically designed to detect the new junction produced by the duplication, and is3f1/is3r <dig> and is3f1/is3r <dig> to detect the 2668-bp is3-mediated deletion . under the non-selective conditions , the proportion of clones harboring the heterozygous duplication decreased significantly by the third 24-hour growth cycle , with the concomitant significant increase of the proportion of clones with single ancestral or deleted copies . by contrast, the proportion of clones harboring the heterozygous duplication was high and stable over the three days under the original selection condition . these results showed the genetic instability of the heterozygous duplication under non-selective conditions, in stark contrast to its stability over a short-term period in the glucose-limited conditions prevailing during the evolution experiment. however and despite these stability differences, we were unable to distinguish phenotypically  the clones harboring the heterozygous duplication and the single deleted copy .

discussion
evolution experiments propagating bacterial populations in glucose- or phosphate-limited chemostats have been extensively developed to understand the dynamics of adaptive processes  <cit> . genes involved in transport and consumption of glucose  <cit> , encoding global regulators of gene expression  <cit>  and dna repair enzymes  <cit>  have been shown to be changed during evolution. however, several evolved clones followed alternative evolutionary pathways not uncovered by whole-genome sequencing. here, we identified one such path, consisting of complex chromosomal rearrangements that included a large 180-kb duplication of the 46’ chromosomal region followed by the divergence of the two tandem duplicated copies. one copy experienced a 2668-bp deletion removing part of the ogrk gene and both yegr and yegs. we showed that the duplication was highly unstable under non-selective conditions but not in the conditions prevailing during evolution. however, the duplication per se did not provide any of the phenotypic traits associated with the adaptation of these evolved clones in the chemostats. in striking contrast, inactivating yegs in the ancestral background was sufficient to confer all evolved phenotypes.

the benefit conferred by the yegs deletion, together with the dominance of the deleted allele over its ancestral counterpart, are difficult to infer owing to the lack of information about yegs. indeed, yegs is annotated as a putative diacylglycerol kinase potentially involved in the response to acid stress  <cit> . a yegs knockout results in the loss of mannose and acetate consumption  <cit> . diacylglycerol is a lipid second messenger in many organisms  <cit> , and the yegs deletion may result in alterations of regulatory and/or metabolic networks owing to changes in lipid signaling pathways in e. coli.

previous studies, with salmonella typhimurium populations propagated in arabinose- or melibiose-limited chemostats  <cit> , detected  <dig> and 25%, respectively, of cells harboring arae or melb duplications that emerged within only 50– <dig> hours of incubation. the amplified genes are responsible for arabinose or melibiose uptake and are therefore under strong selection for elevated expression levels under these conditions. in salmonella, duplications and rearrangements also occur upon prolonged storage of strains and in clinical settings  <cit> . in contrast, in the glucose-limited chemostat populations of e. coli, the major early adaptive changes involve a series of regulatory mutations increasing the levels of glucose transport components  <cit> . earlier studies of lactose-limited chemostats also showed that the first selective sweeps were by lac-constitutive mutants, only later followed by dna amplifications  <cit> . therefore, one may speculate whether inherent differences between salmonella and e. coli may exist for duplication rates and/or costs. interestingly, the bw <dig> lineage carrying the duplication emerged later as a minority clone, with an adaptive pathway very different from the other clones in the chemostat population  <cit> , since its fitness was shown to be frequency dependent.

while many duplication  events have been detected in classical genetic studies where strong selection was applied, it is not the case during laboratory evolution experiments, with one notable exception  <cit> . we showed here that this may be merely linked to the high instability of the duplication events under non-selective conditions. hence, a single overnight growth cycle was sufficient to generate at high frequency offspring that lost the duplication . most analyses of evolved clones sampled from evolution experiments involve culture cycles under non-selective conditions for further analyses. we show here that such experimental practices may result in the loss of duplication events and that sampling single clones may lead to an underestimation of these chromosomal rearrangements. therefore, storing and analyzing evolved isolates must be carefully performed. instabilities in bacterial stocks are well-known  <cit>  and our data emphasize the importance of minimizing sub-culturing steps. it was only good fortune that at least one clone, randomly sampled from the original chemostat population, retained the duplication.

a comprehensive view of the stability of genome duplications is yet missing at the evolutionary, ecological and molecular levels. the reca protein is involved in homologous recombination and is important in resolving duplications  <cit> . on the other hand, some bacterial duplications may be stable, including those involving recombination at rrna  operons  <cit> . here, we observed that the heterozygous duplication was much more stable under the glucose-limited chemostat conditions than under non-selective conditions . therefore, it might confer a direct selective advantage in the evolution regime. however, all evolved phenotypes were related to either the 2668-bp deletion alone or the single inactivation of yegs. hence, the duplication by itself does probably not confer a direct benefit to the evolved cells, in contrast to duplications that result in a gene-dosage advantage  <cit> .

several reasons may explain the stability differences in selective and non-selective conditions. first, the resolution components may be differentially regulated in various environments. second, the fitness cost of the duplication may be larger during rapid growth resulting in higher instability. moreover, we showed that the heterozygous duplication had no fitness disadvantage over the single deletion copy, suggesting little fitness cost in chemostats. third, the duplication may represent a precursor enhancing the likelihood of the substitution of a beneficial mutation through an increase in the mutational target and in local mutation rates. as such, the contribution of the duplication in the evolution of bw <dig> may involve a second-order selection process  <cit>  that has been shown to occur during experimental evolution with e. coli <cit> . finally, our results are not consistent with the model for divergence after duplication  <cit> , in which selection continuously favors both the maintenance of the duplicated copies and the divergence of one copy from the parental one.

a fascinating property of the evolved duplication is its ability to resolve into either the ancestral or deleted copy that may provide robustness by buffering against deleterious mutations. on the other hand, the capacity to recover the ancestral chromosome when selection is removed endows the evolved strain with increased evolvability in alternative environments. finally, the demonstration of ancestral and evolved copies inside a duplication provides a newly documented example of an evolutionary intermediate, with different selection pressures acting on the two copies providing the basis of evolutionary divergence.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified for the first time during laboratory evolution experiments the presence of a heterozygous duplication, one copy presenting a small deletion that was shown to be dominant and beneficial under the selective conditions. studies of the stability of the duplicated genotype under different environmental conditions revealed that it was unlikely to have been submitted to direct selection during evolution but rather to indirect selection. this duplication therefore balances the robustness and evolvability traits of the bacterial populations evolving in the glucose-limited chemostats.
