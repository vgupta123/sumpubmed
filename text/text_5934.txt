BACKGROUND
shigella is the major cause of endemic bacillary dysentery  in developing countries. it is estimated that there are about  <dig>  million cases of shigellosis annually worldwide, of which  <dig>  million were in developing countries, resulting in  <dig>  million deaths, most of which were children under 5 years of age  <cit> . among the four shigella species, s. dysenteriae, s. flexneri, s. boydii, and s. sonnei, s. flexneri is the predominant species.

based on the combination of antigenic determinants present in the o-antigen of the cell envelope lipopolysaccharide , s. flexneri is further divided into various serotypes. to date, at least  <dig> serotypes have been recognized  <cit> . except for serotype  <dig>  all share a basic repeating tetrasaccharide unit, comprised of one glcnac and three rhamnoses  <cit> . modifications to the side chain of the tetrasaccharide by the addition of glucosyl and/or o-acetyl groups give rise to various antigenic determinants  <cit> . the genes responsible for the o-antigen modification are always either the gene cluster gtrabc for glucosyl groups or the single oac gene for the o-acetyl group; all encoded by serotype-converting bacteriophages  <cit> . in all glucosylation modification phages, the gtrabc gene cluster is always located immediately upstream of the attp site, followed by the int and xis genes  <cit> .

up to now, four s. flexneri serotype-converting bacteriophages, sfv, sfx, sf <dig> and sfii, have been induced and purified by different groups  <cit> . morphologically, sfv and sfii, which have an isometric head and a long tail, belong to group a in the family of myoviridae <cit> ; while sfx and sf <dig>  which possess a short tail linked to an isometric head, belong to the family of podovirida <cit> . the complete genome sequences of phage sfv and sf <dig> have been obtained by directly sequencing the phage dna purified from phage particles, and their genetic features have been well characterized  <cit> . recently, the prophage genome of sfx was determined from the sequenced s. flexneri serotype xv strain 2002017; which is presumably the whole genome of phage sfx, because a sfx phage particle can be induced and isolated from  <dig>  <cit> . the sfx genome is  <dig>  bp length, encoding  <dig> orfs . the genome of sfii has not yet been sequenced from free phage particles, but prophage genomes can be derived from sequenced s. flexneri serotype 2a strains sf <dig> and 2457t  <cit> , which show considerable variation with one or both being prophage remnants.

s. flexneri serotype  <dig> is defined by reaction with type i antisera. a total of  <dig> subtypes, 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d have been recognized  <cit> . in serotype  <dig>  a glucosyl group is attached to the glcnac residue of the repeating unit by an alpha- <dig>   <dig> linkage, which results in the presence of serotype 1-specific i antigen. the type i modification is mediated by an o-antigen glucosylation locus  encoded on the sfi prophage genome  <cit> . the glucosylation genes and flanking partial sfi sequences were previously obtained from a serotype 1a strain y <dig>  <cit> . however, the free phage particle of sfi had not been isolated, and its full genomic characteristics have not yet been elucidated  <cit> .

in this study, we induced and purified the free sfi phage particles from s. flexneri serotype 1a clinical strain  <dig> and characterized its morphology, host range and genomic features.

RESULTS
isolation of phage sfi from s. flexneri serotype 1a strain 019
using the conditions described in methods, we induced the sfi phage from serotype 1a strain  <dig>  plaques were observed on the semi-solid lb agar when the host strain  <dig> was infected with induced products from strain  <dig>  lysogens isolated from plaques were serologically identified as serotype 1a, characterized by agglutination with both typing sera i and grouping sera 3; <dig>  pcr amplification indicated that the sfi specific gene gtri is present on both phage particles and the lysogens. these results suggest that phage sfi has been successfully induced and isolated from strain  <dig>  this is the first report of isolation of free sfi particles from s. flexneri.

the morphology of sfi is characteristic of the myoviridae family
the purified sfi phage particles were morphologically analyzed using electron microscopy. the phage has a hexagonal head of ca. 55 nm in diameter, a knob-like neck, a contractile tail of ca. 110 nm, and a tail sheath of ca. 55 nm . there are indications of a baseplate-like structure and long tail fibers, but no other distinctive features could be seen . these characteristics suggest that phage sfi is a member of the myoviridae family in the order caudovirale <cit> .

in comparison to other morphologically characterized serotype-converting phages sf <dig>  sfv, sfii and sfx, sfi has a very similar appearance to sfii and sfv  <cit> , but distinctive from sfx and sf <dig>  <cit> . the microscopic difference reflected the genetic divergence among them in that the sfi packaging and structure genes were identical to those of phage sfv, but divergent from those of sfx and sf <dig> .

phage sfi has a very narrow host range
host specificity of serotype-converting bacteriophages has long been recognized, which results in the specific lytic spectrum and serotype conversion of s. flexneri in nature  <cit> . the recognition between the o-antigen of host bacterium and the tail component of a phage is the key mechanism of host specificity  <cit> . to determine the host range of sfi, 132 s. flexneri strains of  <dig> serotypes  were tested following the methods described in the methods. apart from  <dig> serotype y strains, which were all converted to serotype 1a as expected, the  <dig> serotype x strains tested were also lysogenized, and converted to a newly named serotype 1d  <cit> . the serotype 1d strains were serologically characterized as reacting with both serotype  <dig> specific i typing sera and serotype x specific 7; <dig> grouping sera  <cit> . interestingly, such a serotype has already appeared in natural infections in anhui and henan provinces, china  <cit> . except for serotypes y and x, the other serotypes could not be lysogenized by phage sfi. a possible explanation for the host range restriction of phage sfi is phage immunity due to modification of the o-antigen as phage receptors  <cit> .

sfi uses a site-specific mechanism for dna packaging and has the same attp core sequence as sfii, sfiv, sfv and sfx
restriction enzyme analysis revealed that phage sfi has a linear but not circular genome . genomic comparison found that the sfi prophage genome has similar packaging genes to that of phage sfv; and the fragments adjacent to them were also highly similar to the cohesive end site  of phage sfv  <cit> , with only one base difference at the 5′ end . these data suggest that sfi may use the same site-specific mechanism as sfv for packaging. direct sequencing of the putative termini of the sfi genome extracted from free phage particles and comparison of the corresponding regions with the sfi prophage genome in strain  <dig> revealed a  <dig> nucleotide  gap in the sfi phage genome. therefore, we conclude that sfi uses a cos mechanism for dna packaging as postulated for phage sfv  <cit> , and does not use a head full mechanism  as for phage sf <dig> and sfx  <cit> .

integration of lambdoid phages into the bacterial chromosome generally occurs by site-specific recombination between the phage attp and the bacterial attb sites  <cit> . in all serotype-converting phages except for sf <dig>  the attp site is always found located immediately downstream of the o-antigen modification genes, and preceded by the int and xis genes  <cit> . to determine the attp site of phage sfi, the region between genes gtra and inti of sfi was pcr amplified and sequenced and a 261 bp sequence was obtained, in which,  <dig> bases, attcgtaatgcgaaggtcgtaggttcgactcctattatcggcacca, were found to be identical to the attr/attl core sequence of prophage sfi in strain y <dig>  <cit>  . in the lysogen of 036_1a, the  <dig> nucleotide sequence was divided into two parts, located at opposite ends of the sfi prophage genome . evidently, site-specific recombination occurred at this attp site. the attp core sequence of sfi is identical to that of s. flexneri serotype-converting phage sfii, sfv and sfx, as well as that of serotype-converting phages p <dig> of salmonella typhimurium and dlp <dig> of e. coli <cit> .

characterization of sfi genome sequence
the complete genome sequence of sfi was obtained by combining the sfi prophage genome of host strain  <dig> with the attp site obtained by pcr sequencing as above. firstly, the whole genome sequence of host strain  <dig> was sequenced using illumina solexa sequencing. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were generated to reach about 110-fold coverage and assembled de novo into  <dig> contigs and scaffolds. the sfi prophage genome located between genes int and gtria was extracted from one of the contigs which was further assembled with the attp site sequence obtained above to construct a circular phage sfi genome. to revert to the linear organization as usual practice, we artificially linearised the sequence starting from the terminase small subunit gene and ending with the cos site .

the genome size of sfi is  <dig>  bp similar to that of sequenced s. flexneri serotype-converting phages sf <dig>   <cit> , sfv   <cit>  and sfx  . the overall g + c content is  <dig> %, which is very similar to that of its host   <cit> . sixty-six putative orfs  were predicted and their functions are listed in the additional file 1: table s <dig> 

the genetic architecture of the sfi genome is similar to that of sequenced s. flexneri serotype-converting phages sfv, sf <dig> and sfx: the left-most region encodes genes for phage packaging and structure, followed by the middle region with genes involved in serotype conversion, integration/excision, recombination, immunity and regulation, replication and the nin region, and then the putative lysis cassette at the right-most region ending with the cos site of the phage genome . the genomic structure of sfi is also similar to that of phage sfv and lambda. thus it belongs to the family of lambdoid phages.

trnascan was used to find trna genes. two trna genes in tandem, with anticodons guu for asparagine  and ugu for threonine , were found to be located downstream of gene q . one or both of these trna genes were also to be found located at this position in phage sf <dig>  st64t, ps <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . a recent study suggested that phage-encoded trna could serve to supplement the host trna reservoir, allowing the rare codons in the phage to be more efficiently decoded  <cit> . codon analysis indeed found a convincing bias of aca  in the sfi genome when compared to its s. flexneri host , but no obvious bias was observed on caa , and the significance of the trna-asn in sfi is not clear.

genomic comparison reveals that sfi is genetically related to shigella phage sfv, e. coli prophage e <dig> and lambda
the orfs encoded in the sfi genome were searched against the genbank database at both dna and amino acid levels. sfi encoded proteins exhibited homology to various phages and prophages originating from various hosts, including shigella , e. coli  and salmonella . figure  <dig> displays the homologies of phage sfi to other phages. the sfi genes involved in phage packaging and morphogenesis are homologous and organized in a similar manner to those of phage sfv, phi-p <dig>  st64b and prophage e <dig>  as reported earlier  <cit> , the o- antigen modification and integration and excision modules  are homologous to that of serotype-converting bacteriophages from s. flexneri  and salmonella . however, the early and regulatory regions located in the right half of the genome were homologous to that of lambda and shiga toxin- <dig> and shiga toxin− <dig> phages .

therefore sfi is a mosaic phage with its left half most homologous to phage sfv  and e. coli prophage e <dig>  and right half most homologous to lambda . homology to sfv encompasses at least  <dig> orfs encoding functions for morphology , o-antigen modification , integration/excision  . the homologous orfs are located in four contiguous regions, amounting to  <dig>  bp nucleotides and accounting for  <dig> % of the entire phage genome . sfi also shared genetic relatedness with the e. coli prophage e <dig>  the homologous regions mainly encode proteins responsible for phage assembly and morphogenesis and are located in the left half of the sfi genome . the homologous regions account for 46% of the sfi genome. based on the homology of the first  <dig> orfs , it seems that sfi is closer to e <dig> than to sfv since  <dig> orfs  are highly homologous between sfi and e <dig>  but share little homology between sfi and sfv. for the remaining  <dig> orfs except orf <dig>  the pairwise percentage identities are very similar between sfi, sfv and e <dig>  on the other hand, the homology between sfi and sfv extends further to orf <dig> with high homology of orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig> to orf <dig>  similarly, six contiguous dna segments, which account for  <dig> % of the sfi genome, were found to be homologous to the corresponding regions of lambda. these homologous regions are mainly located in the early and regulatory regions, and encode functional modules for phage recombination , immunity and regulation , replication , nin region , and part of the lysis module  . thus a total of  <dig> % of the sfi genome is homologous to either sfv, e <dig> or lambda.

CONCLUSIONS
the serotype-converting bacteriophage sfi was isolated from a s. flexneri serotype 1a strain. it had a narrow lytic pattern and converted only serotype y to serotype 1a and serotype x to serotype 1d. morphologically sfi is a member of the myoviridae family in the order of caudovirale. genomic analysis revealed that sfi contains features of lambdoid phages and is closely related to s. flexneri phage sfv, e. coli prophage e <dig> and lambda. the characterization of serotype-converting phage sfi enhances our understanding of serotype conversion of s. flexneri.
