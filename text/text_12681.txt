BACKGROUND
sesamia nonagrioides lef., commonly called mediterranean corn borer , is the most important pest of maize  in the mediterranean area  <cit> . the use of bt hybrids seemed the most efficient method for controlling this pest, but transgenic crops are not authorized in many european countries and are not allowed for organic production  <cit> . therefore, breeding for resistance to corn borers based on maize genetic variability for resistance would be valuable to the european and organic seed markets. also, recent studies have reported a reduction of efficacy as some important pests have evolved resistance to bt  <cit> . in this context, the stacking of several resistant genes has been proposed as one of the means to delay insect adaptation, and maize natural sources of resistance to stem borers could bring promising genes  <cit> .

in a previous research a collection of  <dig> inbred lines was evaluated for resistance to mcb in a two-year experiment; the inbred b <dig> was classified as moderately resistant  <cit> . b <dig> is an inbred developed from the iowa stiff stalk synthetic population with great historic importance to breeders because the hybrid b73 × mo <dig> has been widely used and is currently relevant as many commercial inbreds have b <dig> in their pedigrees  <cit> . the iowa stiff stalk synthetic population was constituted by  <dig> inbred lines resistant to stalk breakage  <cit>  and the borer resistance exhibited by inbreds developed from this population could be consequence of mechanical resistance  <cit> . however, resistance to mcb attack of the inbred b <dig> is far from attaining the threshold required by farmers. in a previous study, we looked for quantitative trait loci  for stem tunneling by mcb in an array of recombinant inbred lines  developed from the cross b73 × mo <dig>  <cit> , b <dig> and mo <dig> are both inbreds with some resistance to mcb attack  <cit> , and limited gains will be obtained by combining resistance factors from both parents. this result is most likely due to common resistance factors among temperate germplasm. in recent studies the subtropical inbred cml <dig>  <cit>  has shown better performance under mcb attack than b <dig> . cml <dig> has also demonstrated high general combining ability; therefore cml <dig> appears to be a promising candidate to donate novel genes for mcb resistance to temperate germplasm. in this study, qtl analysis for mcb resistance and agronomic traits was performed in a population of ril derived from the cross b73 × cml <dig>  in addition, the feasibility of using marker-assisted selection  for transferring those genetic factors was explored by testing the bias of each qtl by cross validation test.

for the first time, qtl for resistance to mcb has been detected in a segregating population derived from a cross between inbreds with high and moderate resistance. previous studies focused on crosses between moderately resistant and susceptible inbreds , between two inbreds moderately resistant  and between two susceptible inbreds   <cit> . results obtained until now have widened our knowledge about the genetic architecture of maize resistance to mcb, but lacked applicability. however, breeders around the world could benefit from the release of a version of b <dig> with increased resistance to mcb by transferring resistance factors from cml <dig> because some mechanisms of maize resistance could be common for corn borers  <cit> . such resistance mechanisms could include chemical defense systems like benzoxazinoids, mayzin, protease inhibitors, etc. or physical defense traits related with cell wall components like lignin or silica  <cit> .

RESULTS
significant difference between b <dig> and cml <dig> were found for two resistance traits, tunnel length and stalk damaged . heritabilities for resistance traits ranged from low to moderate while for agronomic traits ranged from moderate to high . moderate genetic correlation between tunnel length and plant height  and high genetic correlation coefficients between tunnel length and stalk damaged  were found .table  <dig> means and their standard errors , and heritabilities  of ril population derived from b73 × cml <dig> for traits related to resistance to the mcb and agronomic traits evaluated in two years. mean comparisons of the parental inbreds are also shown

the genetic map covered a length of  <dig>  cm. the average interval between markers was of  <dig>  cm. no segregation distortion from the expected ratio was observed in the analyses for any marker.

in a preliminary fit of the model selection, putative qtl for stalk lodging, kernel resistance, shank resistance, plant height, and days to silking were identified and mapped to different genetic positions . the lod peaks that exceeded the lod threshold chosen by permutation test  indicated the presence of putative qtl  but several of them were excluded after a final fit of the model controlled by the bayesian information criterion  was performed. for tunnel length, days to silking, and yield under infestation with mcb, all the lod peaks that exceed the previously fixed lod threshold were selected as real qtl in the final fit.fig.  <dig> whole-genome scans to detect qtl for resistance and agronomic traits. solid black line represents the lod curve obtained with qtl scan using a marker interval of approximately 10 cm and the red dashed line indicates the lod threshold chosen by permutation test to declare the presence of a significant. gray arrows indicate the presence of putative qtl which were detected in the preliminary fit but not in the final fit of the model selection. black arrows indicated the qtl which were included in final fit of the qtl analysis



eight qtl for resistance traits were identified in this ril population . three qtl for tunnel length were located on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and accounted for more than  <dig> and 25 % of the total genetic and phenotypic variance, respectively, with a percentage of estimation bias between  <dig> and 67 %. the additive effects ranged from  <dig> to 4 cm for each qtl with a bias estimation between  <dig> and 45 %. for stalk damaged two qtl were located on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  each explained more than  <dig> and 10 % of the genetic and phenotypic variance, respectively, but the estimation biases for those parameters were too high . the additive effect estimated in the test set  for both qtl for stalk damage were less than 1 %. a qtl for stalk lodging was located on chromosome  <dig> which accounted for  <dig> and  <dig>  % of the genetic and phenotypic variance, respectively, with an estimation bias higher than 90 %. the absolute value of the additive effect estimated in the test set  for this qtl was  <dig>  %. another qtl on chromosome  <dig> was located for kernel resistance which accounted for  <dig> and  <dig>  % of the genetic and phenotypic variance, respectively. however the estimation of these parameters was completely biased as suggested by the results of the cross validation  test . in addition, the additive effect estimated in the ts was very small . for shank resistance, one qtl of small additive effect  was located on chromosome  <dig>  this qtl explained  <dig> and 7 % of the genetic and phenotypic variance, respectively, with an estimation bias of 58 %. eight qtl were identified for agronomic traits . two qtl for plant height were located on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  these qtl accounted for 23 % and 19 % of the total genetic and phenotypic variance, respectively, and the bias estimation of these parameters was of  <dig> and 82 % for the qtl on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the absolute value of additive effect estimated in the ts was  <dig>  cm for the qtl on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  cm for the qtl on chromosome  <dig>  the detection frequency of the qtl on chromosome  <dig> was higher  than that observed in the qtl of chromosome  <dig> .table  <dig> summary of qtl mapped in the ril population derived from b <dig> × cml <dig> under mcb infestation using a genetic map with an average interval between markers of 10 cm

discussion
the heritabilities observed for tunnel length by mcb was intermediate and compare favorably to those obtained with other ril populations under similar conditions of infestation with mcb  <cit> . heritability for kernel resistance observed herein  is inferior to that obtained  by ordás et al.  <cit> . in addition, the heritability for shank resistance was not different from zero which is in agreement with samayoa et al.  <cit> . the heritabilities for agronomic traits were similar to those obtained by other authors in numerous, diverse ril populations .

as the goal is to detect reliable qtl, most discussion will be focused on results from the final fit of the model selection that is conditioned by the bayesian information criterion   <cit> . although this model selection criteria tend to find slightly fewer qtl compared with other criteria it minimizes the risk of selecting spurious qtl  <cit> .

no qtl for stalk tunneling by mcb were previously reported in bins  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . however, qtl for tunnel length by the european corn borer  have been previously mapped to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . krakowsky et al.  <cit>  and orsini et al.  <cit>  also localized qtl for tunnel length and stalk breakage by ecb in the bin  <dig> . as all favorable alleles for tunnel length in this study came from the subtropical line cml <dig>  this inbred could clearly enhance the resistance of the line b <dig> by providing new alleles of resistance in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and, even, in the chromosome  <dig> where it is known that the b <dig> line carries alleles associated with resistance to tunnel length by ecb  <cit> . in addition, the additive effects for the three qtl detected for tunnel length were, in general, higher  than those reported in the studies mentioned above  and, most importantly, the cv analysis revealed that the reliability of qtl for tunnel length was moderate to high.

qtl for tunnel length and plant height were co-localized in the same region of the chromosomes  <dig>  in addition, a significant and moderate genetic correlation between tunnel length and plant height was found agreeing with results of previous qtl studies with artificial infestation both with mcb  <cit>  as with ecb  <cit> . in addition, in a recent association mapping for resistance to mcb attack it was observed an intermediate and positive genetic correlation between tunnel length and plant height but no significantly associated snp was co-localized for both traits  <cit> , therefore it remains necessary to carry out deepest studies to elucidate if these findings are due to linkage or pleiotropy. qtl for tunnel length and days to silking were also co-localized on chromosome  <dig>  opposite signs of the additive qtl effects for these traits indicate that flowering time could be slightly delayed when transferring resistance alleles from cml <dig> to b <dig> but it was not supported by the genetic correlation between these traits. yield would not be significantly modified because no genetic correlation was found between tunnel length and yield under infestation unlike to other studies in which selection to reduce tunnel length made by corn borers has resulting in an important reduction of yield probably due to linkage between certain alleles for resistance and some alleles affecting maize yield. .

the final fit for days to silking revealed the presence of three qtl in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and 9; one of them was also detected by buckler et al.  <cit>  in the same ril population and genotyping data but different data analysis method. the qtl for days to silking on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> detected herein were not detected by those authors; while a qtl in chromosome  <dig> detected by buckler et al.  <cit>  was found in the preliminary fit but it was not retained in the final fit. these discrepancies between our results and those provided previously by buckler et al. were probably due to qtl × environment interaction effects and stressed the importance of making phenotypic evaluations in environments similar to those for which breeding materials are intended.

we identified three novels qtl for grain yield under infestation with s. nonagrioides in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in previous studies, qtl for yield under infestation with mcb were located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> , and qtl for grain yield under infestation with ecb have been reported on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . alleles from the line b <dig> at qtl in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> increased grain yield, but the allele from cml <dig> for the qtl in chromosome  <dig> could be used to improve yield of the inbred b <dig>  although this qtl would need to be tested in hybrid for efficacy since yield qtl in inbreds versus hybrids are poorly correlated. in general, the additive effects estimated in ts of each of the three qtl  were higher than those obtained by authors mentioned above . the qtl located in chromosome  <dig> is especially interesting because it explained a high proportion of the genetic variance  with the lowest estimation bias for this parameter and with a high detection frequency  through cv runs. although no qtl for yield under infestation with corn borers have been previously found in this region  several studies have reported important qtl for grain yield and its components in physiological conditions in the same region in other mapping populations . even the results of a fine mapping study suggest that a pleiotropic locus could be affecting grain yield and related traits in this region of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the inbred cml <dig> could enhance the resistance of the inbred b <dig> without reducing its yield under infestation by providing new alleles of resistance in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> where it is known that the inbred b <dig> carries alleles associated with resistance to tunnel length by ecb. the inbred cml <dig> could also potentially provide favorable alleles for yield under infestation with mcb on chromosome  <dig> 

three novels qtl for yield under infestation with mcb were found in this ril population, the highly reliable qtl of chromosome  <dig> with an additive effect of  <dig>  mg ha− <dig> being particularly important.

cross validation analyses confirmed the moderate to high reliability of qtl detected for tunnel length and supported the use of markers associated to these qtl for performing marker-assisted selection in order to transfer resistance alleles from cml <dig> to b <dig>
