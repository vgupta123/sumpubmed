BACKGROUND
protein kinases of the dyrk  family play key roles in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in a variety of systems  <cit> . processes controlled by dyrks include the organization of the symmetric cell division in s. pombe  <cit> , the transition from growth to development in dictyostelium  <cit> , the formation of the embryonic axis in c. elegans  <cit> , and the control of erythropoiesis in mammals  <cit> . in drosophila, the kinase encoded by the minibrain gene  plays an essential role in postembryonic neurogenesis  <cit> , and the orthologous proteins in chicken  and mammals  have also been implicated in the regulation of neuronal differentiation . because the human dyrk1a gene is localized within a region of chromosome  <dig> considered to be particularly important for many traits of down syndrome   <cit> , dyrk1a has attracted interest as a candidate gene for brain abnormalities and mental retardation in individuals with down syndrome.

the proposed role of dyrk1a in down syndrome-related mental retardation was supported by analyses of genetically altered mice. three different mouse models  were generated and found to exhibit neurodevelopmental delays and impairment in learning tasks  <cit> . interestingly, mice heterozygous for dyrk1a also show marked abnormalities of brain development and behavior  <cit> , providing evidence that the function of dyrk1a is particularly sensitive to gene dosage effects. it is generally thought that the many features of down syndrome originate from a  <dig> -fold increase in the dosage of genes in the down syndrome critical region  <cit> . expression of the human dyrk1a was shown to be increased  <dig> -fold in fetal and adult brains from subjects with down syndrome  <cit> .

these results imply that the function of dyrk1a is strongly influenced by its level of expression. the activity of many protein kinases is subject to short term control by second messengers , posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, or interaction with regulatory subunits . in contrast, dyrks require phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the activation loop to acquire maximal catalytic activity, but this is an autophosphorylation event that takes place during maturation of the protein and does not appear to be subject to regulation  <cit> . although the activity of dyrk1a has been reported to be modulated by bfgf   <cit>  and by interaction with 14-3- <dig> proteins  <cit> , the kinase was found to be constitutively active in all systems studied so far. hence, regulation of gene expression will directly influence the cellular function of dyrk1a. microarray studies have revealed striking changes in the abundance of dyrk1a mrna in various systems of cellular differentiation and proliferation, e.g., during activation of t-cells  <cit> , in human neutrophils exposed to bacteria  <cit> , in differentiating haematopoetic progenitor cells  <cit> , in the course of melanoma tumor progression  <cit> , or in hpv16-immortalized keratinocytes  <cit> . interestingly, expression of dyrk1a is also tightly controlled in neural progenitor cells of early developing chicken brains  <cit> . altogether, these studies clearly indicate that dyrk1a mrna levels are highly regulated, although the question how the expression of the dyrk1a gene is controlled has not been directly addressed until now.

in this study we have characterized the promoter of the human dyrk1a gene in order to analyze its transcriptional regulation. our data show that transcription of the dyrk1a gene can start within a broad region of  <dig> bp. two non-overlapping regions within the 5'-region of the dyrk1a gene exhibit promoter activity in reporter gene assays and lead to transcripts with alternative noncoding 5' exons. interestingly, one of the two promoter regions is regulated by the transcription factor e2f <dig>  suggesting a potential role of dyrk1a in the cell cycle.

RESULTS
alternative transcription start sites in the human dyrk1a gene
we performed race-pcr on cdna from the human pc <dig> prostate carcinoma cell line. sequencing of cloned pcr products revealed three types of cdnas. the shortest clones contained cdna fragments with their 5'-ends on exon  <dig> upstream of the initiator codon . we considered these cdnas to be truncated because several longer transcripts were already known. second, larger products  contained cdna fragments that started  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the "type 1" transcript described by wang et al.  <cit>   and  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the transcription start of the mnbha transcript that was previously identified by guimera et al.  <cit>  . none of the race products from the pc <dig> cells corresponded to the alternatively spliced mnbhb transcript that was also described in the latter paper. however, we identified two independent clones that contained a short piece of sequence from bp - <dig> to - <dig> that was directly spliced to exon  <dig> .

to confirm the existence of this alternatively spliced transcript, we performed pcr with a specific forward primers matching exon 1a and reverse primers for exon  <dig> . in parallel, a forward primer specific for exon 1b was used with the same reverse primers. we used cdna from the human osteosarcoma cell line saos <dig> as a template to exclude the possibility that the alternative transcript was an aberrant splice product specific to pc <dig> cells. all primer pairs yielded major amplification products that represented the expected transcripts . for each of the alternatively spliced first exons, the major bands in one of the pcrs  were cloned and verified through sequencing. in addition, minor fragments were detected that were about  <dig> bp larger or smaller , and are derived from alternatively spliced transcripts . the same pattern of bands was obtained by pcr on cdna from pc <dig> cells .

none of the race or pcr products that we obtained contained the alternatively spliced additional exons between exon 1b and exon  <dig> that were identified by guimera et al.  <cit>   and wang et al.  <cit>   . however, one of our race clones contained two additional exons between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> . in addition, a clone derived from the upper band in lane  <dig> of the gel presented in figure  <dig> contained another alternative exon between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> . these facultative exons are flanked by bona fide consensus splicing sites, but neither exon shows sequence conservation between rodents and human and they are not supported by expressed sequence tags in the database; furthermore, both contain premature termination codons. the smallest band produced by the pcr in figure  <dig> represented a transcript in which exon 1b was directly spliced to exon  <dig>  as in the clone   <cit>  . this transcript lacks the initiator codon on exon  <dig> and therefore would encode an n-terminally truncated version of dyrk1a, if another atg codon could function as an alternative initiation codon. the relevance of these minor splicing variants is unclear.

structure of the dyrk1a promoter
the present results provide evidence of two transcription start sites separated by  <dig> bp in the 5'-region of the human dyrk1a gene. these start sites initiate two alternatively spliced transcripts that differ in their 5'-untranslated sequences, but are identical within their coding regions. the sequence of this region and the exact positions of the transcription start sites are shown in figure s <dig> . we designate the alternative first exons of these transcripts exon 1a and 1b, respectively, and the corresponding transcription start sites tss a and tss b. both start sites are devoid of canonical tata or caat boxes, but the whole region is very gc-rich and contains numerous potential binding sites for the transcription factor sp <dig> . tss b lies within a cpg island that was previously found to be unmethylated in a comprehensive analysis of the methylation status of cpg islands on human chromosome  <dig> .

no pcr product was identified that started at tss a and contained the whole sequence up to exon 1b. however, we cannot exclude that such transcripts escaped detection because the shorter variant might have been positively selected during pcr. tss b is identical to the 5'-end of the mnbha transcript described by guimera et al.  <cit> . we designate the first exon of the mnbhb transcript proposed by guimera exon 1m because this transcript was reported to be specifically expressed in muscle.

chromatin organization in the 5'-region of the human dyrk1a gene
barski et al.  <cit>  have recently generated a genome-wide, high resolution map of histone methylation and chromatin organization in resting human cd4+ t-cells through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis . the results for the dyrk1a gene within this dataset show that the highest level of rna polymerase ii binding was found in the region around exon 1a/1b . other characteristics typical of active promoters, e.g,. the presence of the histone h2a.z and of histone h <dig> that is trimethylated on lys <dig>  were also specifically detected in this region. the region upstream of exon  <dig>  which was regarded as the promoter of the dyrk1a gene in previous studies  <cit> , exhibits neither the characteristics of an active nor an inactive promoter .

transcription start sites of the human dyrk1a gene in the cage database
to further define the heterogeneity of transcription start sites in the dyrk1a promoter, we took advantage of the cap-analysis of gene expression  database of transcription start sites that was established by the fantom consortium  <cit> . cage tags are derived from capped mrna molecules and thus represent the 5'-ends of individual transcripts. in total,  <dig> cage tags mapped to the human dyrk1a gene . of these,  <dig> tags mapped to the  <dig>  bp-region upstream of tss b, whereas only two tags were located in the vicinity  of exon 1m, and no tags mapped to the  <dig>  bp upstream of exon  <dig>  carninci et al.  <cit>  have grouped cage tags into tag clusters  that were operationally defined to characterize promoters. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  major tag clusters are located close to tss a and tss b, respectively, confirming that the race clones obtained in our study represent major transcription start sites. in addition, a considerable number of tags, including the largest tag cluster of the dyrk1a gene , map to the region between tss a and tss b. given that each cage tag represents the true 5'-end of an individual mrna molecule, this analysis shows that transcription of the dyrk1a gene can initiate within a broad region of about  <dig> bp. there was no difference in tissue distribution between the cage tags belonging to the different tag clusters. this unusual broad distribution of transcription start sites was also found in mouse tissues , indicating that it is conserved feature of this gene.

promoter activities of human dyrk1a 5'-regions
we cloned a  <dig> bp-sequence upstream of human exon 1m , a  <dig> bp-region upstream of exon 1a, and a  <dig> bp-region upstream of exon 1b in order to characterize their promoter activities in reporter gene assays. in addition, we generated a series of deletion constructs of the 1453-bp sequence in order to localize regulatory sequence elements and the minimal promoter region. the results of the luciferase assays in the human osteosarcoma cell line saos <dig> clearly show that the two non-overlapping regions upstream of tss a  and tss b  were able to independently drive reporter gene expression . promoter region a was 14-fold more active than promoter region b, and the promoter activity of all constructs including both tss a and tss b was consistently higher than of those containing only tss b. the lower activity of the -1453/+ <dig> construct as compared to the -1453/- <dig> construct is possibly due to the fact that in the full length construct, transcription from tss a proceeds through the whole region between tss a and tss b. also, the presence of the unusually long 5'-utr  may impede efficient translation.

in contrast to the regions upstream of tss a and tss b, the putative promoter region upstream of exon 1m did not stimulate luciferase activity in saos <dig> cells. the same result was obtained in cos <dig> cells , and this region was not studied further in the present work. because of the muscle-specific expression of exon 1m containing transcripts, functional analysis of the promoter region might require the use of a myoblast cell line.

upregulation of dyrk1a by e2f1
in two independent microarray studies, dyrk1a was among the genes upregulated by overexpression of the transcription factor e2f <dig> in the human u2os osteosarcoma cell line  <cit>  and in murine nih3t <dig> fibroblasts  <cit> . to confirm these results, we analyzed the effect of e2f <dig> overexpression on dyrk1a mrna levels in phoenix cells. this cell line is a derivative of human embryonic kidney cells , and was chosen for this experiment because it allows efficient transient transfection and has previously been used for analysis of e2f <dig> effects  <cit> . as shown in figure 5a, overexpression of e2f <dig> in phoenix cells caused a marked increase of dyrk1a mrna levels. to confirm this result in a different cell line, we took advantage of a saos <dig> cell clone that allows tetracycline-regulated overexpression of e2f <dig>  <cit> . again, dyrk1a mrna was upregulated upon induction of e2f <dig> overexpression.

e2f <dig> specifically enhances activity of promoter region b
next we determined the effect of e2f <dig> on the promoter activities of the dyrk1a reporter gene constructs in saos <dig> cells. as shown in figure 6a, induction of e2f <dig> expression by doxycycline caused a four-fold increase in the promoter activity of all constructs containing only promoter region b but did not significantly affect constructs containing tss a. note that because of their higher basal activities , constructs containing tss a exhibited even higher promoter activities than the e2f1-stimulated constructs containing only tss b. therefore, the e2f <dig> effect was not detectable with constructs containing both tss a and tss b.

next we asked whether the murine dyrk1a promoter was also regulated by e2f <dig>  for a direct comparison of human and murine promoters, reporter gene vectors including either tss a or b were analyzed side by side in saos <dig> cells. this experiment showed that the basal activities of homologous promoter constructs for tss a and tss b were very similar . like in the human promoter, two non-overlapping fragments of the murine promoter are capable of driving reporter gene expression, and also similar to the human promoter, promoter region a shows about 10-fold  higher activity than promoter region b. overexpression of e2f <dig> enhanced the activity of promoter region b , as was also observed with the human promoter constructs. although these results provide clear evidence for an e2f <dig> effect on promoter region b, our data do not exclude the possibility that e2f <dig> can also affect transcription from tss a because weak stimulatory effects may have been masked by the higher basal activity of these promoter constructs.

mutational analysis of putative e2f <dig> and sp <dig> binding sites in promoter region b
inspection of the  <dig> bp-sequence upstream of tss b revealed a putative e2f1-binding site at - <dig> that matched the criteria of a consensus sequence . we generated a point mutation of this motif in the - <dig> reporter gene construct that is driven by the e2f1-responsive promoter b. in addition, we mutated two sp <dig> sites immediately upstream of tss b because sp <dig> and e2f <dig> can interact in the regulation of gc-rich promoters  <cit> . luciferase assays were performed in saos <dig> cells as before to analyze potential effects of these mutations. as shown in figure 7b, neither the basal nor the e2f1-induced promoter activity was significantly changed by the mutations. therefore, the three sites are not essential for the regulation of tss b by e2f <dig> 

putative creb binding site in the dyrk1a promoter
in a genome-wide screen for target genes of camp-response element binding protein , impey et al.  <cit> , through a chromatin immunoprecipitation based method, identified dyrk1a as a gene close to which creb was bound in forskolin-stimulated rat pc <dig> cells. furthermore, microarray analysis found dyrk1a mrna to be upregulated by forskolin. because creb is critically involved in synaptic plasticity and learning  <cit> , we decided to study the proposed effect of creb on the dyrk1a promoter. the canonical camp-response element  is an eight-base palindrome  but cres also frequently occur as half-site motifs   <cit> . a sequence motif comprising one cre sequence with a single mismatch and a neighboring half-site is present about  <dig> bp upstream of tss a . this sequence is evolutionary conserved in mammals, including mice .

therefore we analyzed whether dyrk1a mrna is regulated by intracellular camp levels. forskolin is an activator of adenylate cyclase, and the increased camp levels cause the phosphorylation of ser <dig>  and consequently the activation of creb by camp-dependent protein kinase . however, treatment of pc <dig> cells with forskolin did not change dyrk1a mrna levels in pc <dig> cells, as revealed by northern blot analysis . the same result was obtained in an experiment with a pc <dig> clone from a different source . as a control, a known target gene of creb, the protooncogene c-fos  <cit> , was readily induced by forskolin. in spite of this negative result, we performed reporter gene assays in order to assess the effect of forskolin on the activity of promoter region a. no stimulation of either promoter region a or b by forskolin was observed in three different cell lines . in contrast, a synthetic reporter gene construct driven by four consecutive cres was stimulated by forskolin, indicating that the cell lines analyzed were capable of a transcriptional response to forskolin/camp. finally, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with nuclear extracts from forskolin-treated pc <dig> cells to determine whether creb can bind to the cre motif in promoter region a. as shown in figure s <dig> , the probe derived from the dyrk1a gene was detected in creb-containing complexes but the intensity of the bands was much weaker that of those with the consensus cre.

discussion
dyrk1a has attracted considerable interest as a "candidate gene" potentially responsible for several traits related to down syndrome. although the characterization of transgenic mouse models has shown that the correct function of this protein kinase is critically dependent on the gene dosage and, consequently, the intracellular level of the dyrk1a protein, nothing is known about its regulation on the level of gene expression. the present study provides the first functional characterization of the human dyrk1a promoter.

the structural organization of the human dyrk1a gene has previously been described by wang et al.  <cit>  and guimera et al.  <cit> , who have also identified transcripts with 5'-ends in the promoter region. in other reports, the region upstream of exon  <dig> was regarded as the promoter  <cit> , probably because their in silico-methods for promoter identification failed to correctly recognize the first non-coding exon. of the five transcript in the ncbi corenucleotide database, only transcript  <dig>  begins with exon 1b, whereas the others have 5'-ends at exon  <dig>  the analysis of chromatin organization in the human dyrk1a gene  provides clear evidence that only the region around exons 1a and 1b exhibits features of an active promoter. the distribution of cage tags also shows no evidence of a promoter upstream of exon  <dig>  here we describe a new transcription start site  which belongs to an alternative first exon  located  <dig> bp upstream of the known tss b. both transcript variants encode the same protein, but their expression is controlled by different promoter sequences. in addition to these two transcription start sites, evaluation of the cage tag database revealed that transcription can start at many more different sites within the region between tss a and b. according to the working definition used by carninci et al.  <cit> , the promoter region of the human dyrk1a gene encompasses  <dig> non-overlapping cage tag clusters that by definition should represent alternative promoters . each of these clusters displays a broad distribution of start sites, and according to the classification of carninci et al.  <cit>  the overall distribution can be described as "broad with dominant peaks"  plus an extra cluster at tss b . it remains to be determined whether the tag clusters between tss a and tss b, in particular the largest cluster at about - <dig>  represent independent core promoters.

the extended distribution of tss is typical for promoters that lack a tata-box and contain transcription start sites within cpg islands  <cit> . the region of the dyrk1a promoter has previously been classified as an unmethylated cpg island  <cit> . consensus sites for the transcription factor sp <dig> are overrepresented in promoters with high cg content, and sp <dig> is capable of recruiting tata-binding protein in the absence of tata boxes  <cit> . we have studied the role of two sp <dig> consensus sites close to tss b and found that mutation of these sites did not affect the reporter gene activity of promoter region b. this result does not exclude a regulatory role of sp <dig>  since other sp <dig> sites are present further upstream .

the use of alternative promoters allows for a more complex regulation of gene expression. two different, non-overlapping fragments of the dyrk1a promoter region are capable of driving reporter gene expression. the higher activity of promoter region a was not specific to saos <dig> cells, but was also observed in other cell lines , arguing against the possibility that the two promoters bring about tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. in accordance with this observation, the cage tag analysis also revealed no tissue-specificity in the composition of the different tag clusters . however, the two promoter regions differed strikingly in their response to overexpression of e2f <dig>  all promoter constructs driven by promoter b were stimulated by e2f <dig>  but none of the constructs that contained tss a showed a significant response. although promoter region a was still more active than promoter region b, total levels of dyrk1a mrna were increased by e2f <dig> overexpression in phoenix cells and saos <dig> cells.

e2f transcription factors are well known to regulate numerous genes essential for dna replication and cell cycle progression, and also dna damage repair, apoptosis, development and differentiation  <cit> . although so far no study has directly addressed the function of dyrk1a in the cell cycle, dyrk1a mrna levels were repeatedly found to be regulated in systems of cellular differentiation and proliferation . consistent with a role in cell cycle regulation or apoptosis, dyrk1a was identified among the  <dig> genes whose pattern of expression in human leukemia cells most accurately discriminated responses of patients to cytostatic agents  <cit> . interestingly, in transgenic mice dyrk1a overexpression has been described to be associated with high levels of cyclin b <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, dyrk1a overexpression has been shown to enhance nerve growth factor -mediated neuronal differentiation of pc <dig> cells  <cit> . many e2f <dig> target genes including the homeobox genes are involved in developmental regulation  <cit> , which is another area where dyrk1a has been implicated  <cit> . further research is required to clarify the consequences of dyrk1a upregulation by e2f <dig> 

mutation of the only potential e2f binding site in front of tss b did not affect e2f1-induced reporter gene activity. however, it is well known that some genes are regulated by e2f factors in the absence of canonical e2f sites  <cit> . for transcriptional activation of the human ask gene, binding of e2f to a non-consensus site depends on the presence of a neighboring sp <dig> site  <cit> . we have therefore also mutated the two sp <dig> sites closest to tss b but detected no effect on basal or e2f-induced promoter activity. still, e2f <dig> can also bind to gc-rich elements in the absence of consensus e2f consensus elements, and the mutated - <dig> construct still contained several potential sp <dig> sites  <cit> . thus, our results neither exclude the possibility that e2f <dig> acts via binding to a non-consensus e2f site nor that its effect is mediated indirectly by activation or upregulation of other transcription factors.

in addition to e2f <dig>  we tested creb for its potential role in the regulation of the dyrk1a promoter because dyrk1a was detected as a target gene of creb in a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based screen in rat pc <dig> cells  <cit> . a potential cre is located  <dig> bp upstream of human tss a and is conserved in the mouse promoter. although the motif in the dyrk1a promoter does not exactly match the cre consensus sequence, it contains two copies of the cre half site , which binds creb with a lower affinity and is found in about half of the genes with functional cres  <cit> . in fact, binding of creb to this sequence in electrophoretic mobility shift assays was much weaker than binding to a consensus cre . forskolin did not enhance promoter activity in several cell lines, and dyrk1a mrna levels were not increased in forskolin-treated pc <dig> cells. thus, it appears unlikely that creb is a major transcriptional regulator of human or rat dyrk1a/dyrk1a. however, we cannot totally exclude that the lack of a creb effect in our hands is due to heterogeneity of pc <dig> subclones in different labs, or slightly divergent experimental conditions.

up to now, the only transcription factor reported to regulate the dyrk1a promoter was ap <dig> , which was described to negatively regulate expression of dyrk1a in non-neural cells  <cit> . it remains to be determined by which regulatory mechanisms, in addition to transcriptional control by e2f <dig> and ap <dig>  expression levels of dyrk1a are controlled.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results show that transcription of the human dyrk1a gene is controlled by two promoters that differ in their strength and regulation by e2f <dig>  this finding reveals a previously unknown level of complexity in the regulation of expression of the dyrk1a gene, and provides the basis for further studies of its transcriptional regulation. the identification of e2f <dig> as a regulator of dyrk1a expression is consistent with the presumed function of the kinase in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. subtle changes in cell cycle regulation may affect brain development in down syndrome, because neurogenesis involves proliferation and differentiation and is closely linked to the cell cycle  <cit> .
