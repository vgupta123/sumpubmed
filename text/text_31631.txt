BACKGROUND
mood disorders, including depressive and bipolar disorders, are severe, chronic and often life-threatening illnesses with symptoms manifested at the psychological, behavioral, and physiological levels. their etiology is not precisely understood but is believed to be multifactorial, involving heredity, changes in neurotransmitter levels, altered neuroendocrine function, and psychosocial factors  <cit> . in the laboratory, the biological study of mood disorders benefits from standardized animal behavioral tests that have been validated for their predictive validity for antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs. these tests are currently considered major tools for studying the function of targeted mutation in transgenic mice  <cit> . the forced swim  and tail suspension  were developed to evaluate anti-depressant like effects of drugs  <cit> . in genetically modified mice, anti-depressant-like behavior is modeled as a decreased immobility in the fst and the tst  <cit> . in comparison, the cyclic episodes of depression and mania characteristic of bipolar disorder is more difficult to model in a single animal. therefore facets of bipolar disorder are commonly studied separately using distinct models for depression and mania  <cit> . however, in contrast to current models of depression-related behavior mentioned above, there is no specific model for studying mania-like behavior. nonetheless, some paradigms are used for their similarity with clinical observations and are validated through their response to classical mood stabilizing drugs. for example, increased energy or restlessness can be modeled by the hyperactivity induced by psychostimulants, or as a response to a stressful situation and monitored in an open field test, and in the test related to a stressful situation  <cit> . also, poor judgment leading to risk-taking can be tested as a mirror image of most tests for anxiety-like behavior  <cit> . thus the light/dark paradigm based on the mice's natural avoidance of bright spaces is widely used to measure anxiety-like behavior in mutant mice  <cit> ; animals that spend less time in the lit compartment are considered to exhibit anxiety-related behavior  <cit> . similarly, open spaces in the open-field and in the morris water maze serve as another index of anxiety-like behavior based on the propensity of small rodents to avoid open areas. in these paradigms anxiety-related behavior is assessed through the measure of thigmotaxis or wall-seeking behavior  <cit> . furthermore, genetic vulnerability to mania is believed to be expressed behaviorally as excessive goal pursuit  <cit>  which can be modeled using goal-oriented behavioral tests.

pharmacological validation of mania-like behavior can be performed with valproate, a mood stabilizing agent used clinically to treat acute mania  <cit> , which also decreases the phenotype of hyperactivity in the mouse model of mania  <cit> .

in terms of endocrinology, mood disorders coincide with modifications of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis function which can be assessed by measuring plasma glucocorticoid levels. a high plasma cortisol level is considered an endocrine feature of depression and bipolar disorder in patients  <cit> . manic episodes have been shown to be preceded by increases in plasma cortisol level. therefore hpa axis dysfunction was proposed as a potential trait marker in bipolar disorder, possibly indicative of the core pathophysiologic process in the illness  <cit> . in rodents, behavioral responses described as depression-like and anxiety-related coincide with increases in the level of plasma corticosterone  <cit> . in contrast, reduced depression-like and less anxiety-related behaviors are associated with a lowered level of plasma corticosterone  <cit> . in the animal models, therefore, increases in plasma corticosterone levels might argue for face validity at the endocrine level.

pkci/hint <dig> is a member of the hit protein family, characterized by the presence of a hit  sequence motif  <cit> . although the general function of pkci/hint <dig>  as well as its presumably more specialized role in the central nervous system, is not known, results from human postmortem analysis and mice behavioral and anatomical studies suggest that it might be involved in the pathophysiology of certain mental disorders. pkci/hint <dig> was identified as a candidate molecule in the neuropathology of schizophrenia when its gene expression was shown to be decreased via microarray analysis in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients  <cit> , as subsequently validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  <cit> . pkci/hint <dig> was also recognized as a gene candidate in the neuropathology of bipolar disorder when its decreased expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was confirmed in a meta-analysis of  <dig> microarray studies of bipolar disorder  <cit> . we recently showed that, although they do not show any spontaneous hyperactivity in the open field test, pkci/hint <dig> ko mice present higher locomotor and stereotypic responses to the psychostimulant d-amphetamine than wt controls. these are considered positive symptoms in animal models for schizophrenia  <cit> . our study of the brain's distribution of pkci/hint <dig> revealed that its immunoreactivity is primarily located in neurons and neuronal processes of parvalbumin positive neurons in cerebral cortex and limbic system  <cit> . these regions are anatomically related to mood disorders  <cit> .

based on the findings from postmortem studies, pkci/hint <dig> ko mice behavioral observations, and immunocytochemical localization of the pkci/hint <dig> in the brain, we hypothesize that the pkci/hint <dig> protein might be involved in specific neuropsychological functions such that its absence would lead to significant behavioral and endocrine phenotypes associated with mood dysfunction. accordingly, we attempted to test this hypothesis using pkci/hint <dig> ko mice. we assessed behavioral phenotypes that may be characteristic of mood disorders by using the forced swim and tail suspension tests, which are used to model antidepressant-like behavior. we also looked at the involvement of pkci/hint <dig> in the light/dark paradigm and in thigmotaxis as indices of anxiety-related behavior, and we used the morris water maze test for place navigation learning to assess goal-oriented behavior. in order to search for associated endocrine relevance, we assessed the hpa axis activity through the measurement of plasma corticosterone levels. pharmacologically, we examined the effect of valproate on the activity of the animals submitted to the tail suspension test.

RESULTS
pkci/hint <dig> ko mice exhibited less immobility than their wt littermates in the forced swim and the tail suspension tests
immobility in the forced swim test is shown in figure  <dig>  where the pkci/hint <dig> ko mice were  <dig> times less immobile than their wt littermates at every stage of the test from day  <dig> to each of the trials in the four time periods of the second day, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  for genotype in a two-way anova of trials × genotype. immobility time on day  <dig> represented 43% of the total time in the wt mice and 23% in the ko. when considering the four trials of the second day both wt and ko mice displayed increases in immobility over the trials, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  for trials effect, with similar slopes, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> . wt mice displayed a significantly progressive increase in immobility over the number of trials as compared with day 1; on the last trial, immobility time reached 85% of total time. ko mice showed less increase in immobility compared to wt on the last trial, with immobility reaching 42% of total time.

in the tail suspension test, wt and ko mice displayed significant score differences over the  <dig> min test period as shown in figure  <dig>  in figure 2a, the overall immobility time of wt mice was of 83% of the total time; pkci/hint <dig> ko mice were 30% less immobile with an immobility time of 58% of the total time. overall ko mice scores consisted of a  <dig> times higher frequency of small movements  and  <dig> times higher frequency of strong movements of body jerks and jumps than the wt . time course analysis reveals an effect of time for the three parameters in a two-way anova genotype × time, immobility f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , small movements f =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  and strong movements f =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  . in figure 2d, ko mice immobility can be viewed in two phases: one phase was the first minute of the test where initial immobility time is 25% of total time, and the second phase was a  <dig> min steady state where immobility increased to 63% of total time. two similar phases can be observed with the production of small and strong movements, as illustrated in figure 2e and figure 2f, respectively. ko and wt mice behavior patterns were different, as indicated by the genotype effects: f =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  for immobility, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  for small movements, and f =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  for strong movements. indeed, during the  <dig> min test wt mice exhibited a steady state behavior for each of the three parameters of the test . ko mice demonstrated less immobility characterized by more energetic movements as illustrated by the overall measurement and the persistence of bouts of strong movements at  <dig> min of the test.

acute valproic acid decreases the activity of ko mice in the tail suspension test
in the light/dark test pkci/hint <dig> ko mice spent progressively more time in the light compartment than the wt
scores of the pkci/hint <dig> ko mice and their wt littermates in the light/dark test are presented in figure  <dig> as a time course of the time spent in the lit compartment during the light-dark test. during the first  <dig> min of the test there was no difference between wt and ko mice; wt mice spent 47% of the time in the lit compartment and pkci/hint <dig> ko mice spent 42%. curve analysis showed different slopes for wt and ko, f =  <dig>  p =  <dig> . wt animals displayed a slight decrease in the time spent in lit compartment that reaches 41% at the end of the test with a negative linear regression coefficient of - <dig>  not significantly different from zero, f =  <dig>  p =  <dig> . pkci/hint <dig> ko mice spent progressively more time in the lit compartment to reach 75% at  <dig> min; this is illustrated by a positive linear regression coefficient of  <dig>  which is significantly different from zero, f =  <dig>  p =  <dig> . ko mice exhibited a significant progressive preference for the lit compartment.

place navigation performance is enhanced in the pkci/hint <dig> ko mice
the beacon cued learning test of the morris water maze was used as a control experiment to assess ability to learn to swim to a cued goal that relies on intact eyesight, swimming ability, basic strategies of swimming away from the wall, climbing to the platform and motivation to escape from the water  <cit> . performances, shown in figure  <dig>  were identical in wt and ko mice. both animals learned to swim and escape to the platform with similar latencies.

the morris water maze version of a place navigation cognitive test depends on the function of the associative parietal cortex  <cit> . this test was chosen in relation to the anatomical localization of the decrease in pkci/hint <dig> in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of bipolar patients  <cit> . performances of pkci/hint <dig> ko mice and wt littermates are presented in figure  <dig>  latency to reach the platform within the  <dig> min test, plotted as a function of trials in figure 6a, shows a trials effect, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  in a two-way anova trials × genotype. this implies that both wt and ko animals underwent acquisition . initial latencies to reach the platform on the first trial were not different between wt and ko. however, a genotype effect, f =  <dig>  p <  <dig> , accounts for differences in the learning pattern on the trials. significant acquisition was demonstrated in the last block of trials by wt mice with a latency of  <dig> sec, while pkci/hint <dig> ko mice displayed faster learning with a significantly lower latency of  <dig> sec as early as the third block of the trials. ko mice displayed significantly better learning, as attested by a  <dig>  times lower latency to reach the platform on the last block of trials compared to the wt.

retention , shown in figure 6b, was determined during a  <dig> sec probe test by counting the number of crossings of the platform area, both before training and  <dig> h following the last acquisition trial. both wt and ko animals displayed an increase in scores after acquisition with trials effect, f =  <dig>  p =  <dig> , in a two-way anova trials × genotype. animals displayed differences in performances with a genotype effect, f =  <dig>  p =  <dig> . before training, both wt and ko mice scores were near zero. after acquisition, wt animals crossed the platform area once whereas pkci/hint <dig> ko mice showed clear retention by crossing the platform area at least two times, which is considered criterion performance  <cit> .

non cognitive factors are associated with learning and retention performances
non cognitive factors like thigmotaxis and floating are often associated with performance in the morris water maze  <cit> . thigmotaxis time measured when mice swam at a distance within  <dig> cm of the wall of the pool is an indicator of open space anxiety-related behavior  <cit> . figure 6c represents the overall thigmotaxis time during the acquisition phase and the probe test where the pkci/hint <dig> ko mice exhibited significantly  <dig>  times less thigmotaxis than wt mice. evolution of thigmotaxis with trials shown in figure 6d reveals habituation during the acquisition phase with a trials effect, f=  <dig> , p =  <dig> , and a genotype effect, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , in a two-way anova trials × genotype. when compared with trial  <dig>  thigmotaxis significantly decreased at trials  <dig> and  <dig> for wt and ko respectively.

floating time  was measured during the acquisition phase and the probe test. figure 6e shows that overall floating scores for ko mice were significantly lower than wt by  <dig>  times. the graph representing floating time as a function of trials in figure 6f shows a genotype effect, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , in a two-way anova trials × genotype, but no significant trials effect f =  <dig>  p =  <dig>   <dig>  the floating time for ko mice was lower than wt mice in every block. thus wt and ko animals did not exhibit any change in floating time over the trials.

pkci/hint <dig> ko mice basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity is higher than in wild type mice
as shown in figure  <dig>  basal plasma corticosterone level in wild type animals was  <dig>  ng/ml in the morning and increased by 79% to reach a value of  <dig>  ng/ml in the afternoon. the acute stress of the tail suspension test induced an additional increase compared to the afternoon basal level. the same pattern of morning to afternoon variation and increased corticosterone levels after the stressor were observed in the pkci/hint <dig> ko mice, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , for condition in a 2-way anova condition × genotype. additionally, ko mice displayed an afternoon baseline level that was 30% higher than the wt mice, f =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  for genotype in a 2-way anova condition × genotype. immediately following a tail suspension test, wt and ko mice displayed comparable responses to stress, with increased of corticosterone levels reaching  <dig> ng/ml and  <dig> ng/ml respectively.

discussion
we searched for a distinctive phenotype of pkci/hint <dig> ko mice in order to determine the putative role of the pkci/hint <dig> protein in brain function and in particular its involvement in mood regulation.

in order to assess antidepressant-like behavior, we used two standard tests, the porsolt's forced swim test and the tail suspension test. in both tests pkci/hint <dig> ko mice exhibited less immobility than their wt littermates. this phenotype was further confirmed in the morris water maze where ko animals exhibited less floating time than the wt. decreased immobility in the fst and the tst may be due to an antidepressant or a general stimulatory effect, as pointed out by pharmacological studies; antidepressant effects are manifested in attempts to escape, while stimulants lead to motor stimulation that can be measured as an increase in spontaneous activity in the open field test  <cit> . as pkci/hint <dig> ko mice did not display spontaneous hyperactivity in the open field test  <cit> , the decreases in immobility presented here are likely due to persistence in attempts to escape rather than generalized motor stimulation. this is exemplified in the persistence of small and strong movements in the tst.

treatment with the mood stabilizer valproate at  <dig> mg/kg tended to attenuate the movements of ko mice. however a non-significant trend of decreased movements in the wt mice treated with  <dig> or  <dig> mg/kg suggests a possible sedative effect of the drug in stead of mood regulation, which could be specifically assessed in the open field test.

we used the light-dark test based on the mouse's natural preference for the dark and avoidance of bright spaces to assess anxiety-related behavior. in the first  <dig> min corresponding to the classical version of the test that assesses light/dark preference, there was no difference between ko and the wt controls, as both animal types spent an average of 45% of the total time in the lit compartment. a similar slight preference for the dark compartment was reported in mice from the c57bl and 129/svev strains that were naïve to any test when submitted to the light/dark box  <cit> . the time course of the  <dig> min test showed that time spent in the lit compartment increased progressively in pkci/hint <dig> ko mice, so that in the last  <dig> min ko mice spent significantly more time in the lit compartment than wt mice. this phenotype could not be totally attributed to an anxiolytic effect and the  <dig> min light/dark test would require pharmacological validation to be related to anxiety. an alternative explanation would be that, by showing a preference for the naturally aversive properties of the light spaces, the ko mice were exhibiting a risk-taking behavior. additionally, pkci/hint <dig> ko mice in the morris water maze place navigation task displayed significantly less thigmotaxis than the wt mice, showing less anxiety behavior related to open space. in that case, thigmotaxis might have some influence on the learning performances. however, as in the beacon cued learning test with a visible escape wt and ko mice showed similar learning performances, it is probable that in our mice thigmotaxis in the water maze is related to the higher anxiogenic conditions of non visible escape in the place navigation task.

in several experiments presented here, habituation was an important factor, such as habituation to an aversive or novel stimulus. thus some of the results implicated here may imply that there is accelerated habituation in pkci/hint <dig> ko mice, at least to the anxiety-provoking aspects of the experimental environments. perhaps due to this difference, pkci/hint <dig> ko mice exhibited a faster acquisition in the place navigation learning task, and consequently better retention.

by contrast in the modified version of the fst, repeated testing increased immobility to a greater degree in wt mice than in pkci/hint <dig> ko mice. on the second day of fst testing, an increased immobility was observed in wt controls compared to the first trial, while pkci/hint <dig> ko mice remained as active as they were during the first exposure day, not demonstrating increased immobility until the last test of the second day. in the fst paradigm, increased immobility can potentially be influenced by several factors. although generally considered to measure behavioral despair in relation to the effect of anti-depressant drugs  <cit>  it can also reflect learned habituation to an environment that has become familiar to the animal thereby including a memory component on the second exposure. lastly, it could reflect a relatively successful coping strategy that employs energy-conserving behavior and may confer a survival advantage .

as ko mice displayed higher performances in the learning task of place navigation, it is less likely that less learning capacity is responsible for their delayed increased immobility in the fst. yet, pkci/hint <dig> ko mice's persistent struggling in both fst and tst could be related to less coping behavior  <cit> , and thus express excessive goal pursuit as previously suggested in the fst  <cit> . in the same sense, it is also noteworthy that in the goal-directed task of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, pkci/hint <dig> ko mice displayed enhanced performances as compared with wt .

thus the current behavioral data indicate that pkci/hint <dig> has an important influence on depression and open space-anxiety related tests. moreover, pkci/hint <dig> plays an important role in learning and exploration in the place navigation water maze and the development of preference for aversive environment in the  <dig> min version of the light/dark test.

parallel to the behavioral phenotypes, we assessed the activity of the hpa axis via the measurement of plasma corticosterone levels. noticeably, in the same time frame corresponding to the behavioral experiments, pkci/hint <dig> ko mice displayed a higher afternoon basal plasma corticosterone level than the wt controls.

however, the elevated level of corticosterone measured in pkci/hint <dig> ko mice is actually the opposite of what would be expected given the observed behavioral changes. antidepressant in fst and tst and anxiolytic-like behaviors in the light/dark test are usually associated with decreased plasma corticosterone levels  <cit> . on the contrary, in the laboratory and clinically, increased plasma corticosterone/cortisol is associated with increased depression-related and anxiety-like behaviors  <cit> . however, the phenotypes of antidepressant-like and less anxiety-related behaviors were associated with increased corticosterone levels in pkci/hint <dig> ko mice. this has an interesting parallel with clinical observations of increased plasma cortisol levels in manic patients which was not an effect of stress but was described as a feature of the disease  <cit> . indeed, hpa axis dysfunction was reported in bipolar disorder patients  <cit>  and in the mixed mania subtype of bipolar disorder patients  <cit> . in all cases, higher basal plasma cortisol levels were found in bipolar patients relative to the controls. higher plasma cortisol levels in manic patients, compared with healthy controls, were in the same proportional range as what we observed in the pkci/hint <dig> mice  <cit> . moreover, in bipolar patients, the difference occurred in the samples collected in the morning, which corresponds to the awaking time  <cit> . this phenomenon coincides with the findings in our mice. the difference in corticosterone levels between ko and wt mice occurred during the window time that also corresponds to awaking time in these nocturnal animals. when tested for tst and fst in the morning between 9: <dig> to 10: <dig> am, wt and pkci/hint <dig> ko mice displayed the same amount of immobility time .

the difference in plasma corticosterone levels should not be attributed to a stress response due to handling since we did not see any difference between wt and ko in the morning samples. in wt mice, morning and afternoon basal corticosterone levels were similar to those previously reported  <cit> . moreover, wt and ko mice presented similar plasma corticosterone responses to the acute stress of tail suspension. those responses were in the same range as the one described as the maximum response to stress measured following a restraint stress in mice, ca  <dig> ng/ml  <cit> . accordingly, the afternoon-enhanced basal corticosterone levels may be considered an endocrine feature specific to the phenotype of pkci/hint <dig> ko mice.

additionally, in ko mice, hyperactivity in the tail suspension test tended to be attenuated by acute treatment with the clinically effective anti-mania drug valproic acid, suggesting a facet of mania-like behavior. therefore, the afternoon behavioral and endocrine phenotypes of pkci/hint <dig> ko mice could be analogous to mania symptoms associated with high plasma cortisol  <cit> . in that regard, enhanced performances in the place navigation task and persistent struggling in the tst could be considered as enhanced goal-directed activity associated with enhanced energy. moreover these data are in consistent with microarray results demonstrating a decrease in pkci/hint <dig> expression in the brains of bipolar disorder patients, making it a candidate molecule for the disease  <cit> . thus our results may suggest that the pkci/hint <dig> gene may be important in the neuropathology of mania.

our speculations on our results are based on attempting to draw parallels between our behavioral, endocrine and pharmacological observations and clinical descriptions of disease. one may argue that this extrapolation from mice to human patients is excessive specifically because there is no current valid rodent model for studying mania  <cit> . further study of the function of pkci/hint <dig> in the nervous system could help in outlining a theoretical validation. originally pkci/hint <dig> isolated from bovine brain extracts was identified as an in vitro inhibitor of pkc isoforms  <cit>  and pkc inhibitors are promising targets for bipolar disorder drug development  <cit> . however, the physiological significance of pkci/hint1's ability to inhibit pkc has been questioned  <cit>  and so far its exact biochemical function is unclear. in our study, although the exact role of pkci/hint <dig> in the development of those combined phenotypes is unknown, some speculations can be outlined based on the modulation by the protein of the mu opioid receptor . pkci/hint <dig> regulates the mopr by suppressing its desensitization and its pkc-induced phosphorylation  <cit> . a deficiency in the expression of pkci/hint <dig> in mice can significantly enhance both basal and morphine-induced analgesia  <cit> . interestingly, in one study, manic patients exhibited higher analgesia to experimentally-induced pain than healthy matching controls  <cit> . also, opioid analgesics can precipitate a hypomanic/manic reaction in a significant percentage of patients with bipolar disorder while having an antidepressant effect in others  <cit> . in acutely manic patients, methadone decreased symptoms of euphoria, elation, and grandiosity, and significantly decreased plasma cortisol levels. this implies a potentially important interrelationship between the central endogenous opioid peptide systems, neuroendocrine regulatory factors, and the pathophysiology of affective disorder  <cit> . this could be linked to the effects of mopr activity on the hpa function in humans where stimulation of the mopr by the specific agonist fentanyl decreases the level of plasma cortisol  <cit>  and morning mopr blockade by naloxone induces an increase in acth and plasma cortisol levels  <cit> . this could be a mechanism through which changes in pkci/hint <dig> interactions with mopr modulate mopr-associated functions.

CONCLUSIONS
pkci/hint <dig> ko mice displayed a phenotype of behavioral endocrine features indicative of changes of mood function, including anxiolytic-like, antidepressant-like behaviors that tend to be blocked by the mood stabilizer valproate, in conjunction with elevated levels of plasma corticosterone. these results suggest that the pkci/hint  <dig> gene could be important for the mood regulation function in the cns.
