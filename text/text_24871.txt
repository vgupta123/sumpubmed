BACKGROUND
aspergillus fumigatus is both a primary and opportunistic pathogen as well as a major allergen associated with severe asthma and sinusitis  <cit> . the host respiratory system, including that of human, is constantly exposed to its spore because of prolific production of spores and nearly ubiquitous distribution in the environment, at a density of  <dig> to  <dig> conidia/m <dig>  <cit> . the spores can be easily eliminated by the innate immune system from lung epithelial tissue in immunocompetent vertebrates. however, immunocompromised individuals are at risk of invasive aspergillosis as a consequence of proliferation on pulmonary or other tissues via mycelial growth. invasive aspergillosis has an associated mortality rate ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % depending on the patient population  <cit> . the prosperity of a. fumigatus in mammalian and avian infection depends basically on its thermotolerance  <cit> . therefore, the identification of the adaptation mechanism of this fungus to higher temperature is very important for efficient anti-fungal drug development as well as fundamental understanding of pathogenesis of a. fumigatus.

nierman et al.  <cit>  examined the gene expression change throughout a time course upon shift of growth temperatures from 30°c to 37°c and 48°c for investigation of the metabolic adaptation of a. fumigatus. they suggested that host temperature alone  is insufficient to turn on many virulence-related genes because no known genes implicated in pathogenicity showed higher expression at 37°c than that at 48°c. lamarre et al. reported another genome-wide expression study of this fungus at 37°c with different age of conidia  <cit> . their microarray data suggested that dormancy is associated with fermentation and reduced metabolism. in both studies, genome-wide expression profiles were well analysed from a simple level including identification of differentially expressed genes to some complex level including classification of genes with similar profiles, but the transcription regulation structure between genes in a system level has been never studied. actually, the regulation of gene expression is achieved through genetic regulatory systems structured by networks of interactions between dna, rna, proteins, and small molecules  <cit> . thus, it is important to understand how genes in a. fumigatus are transcriptionally regulated for its thermal adaptation.

several methods have been proposed for modelling gene networks including boolean networks  <cit> , bayesian networks  <cit> , differential equations  <cit>  and state space model   <cit> . especially, the temporal network structure of gene regulatory mechanism can be facilitated with time-course microarray data. however, a wide variety of statistical models proposed for estimation of temporal gene network structure are frequently limited because the length of the time-course data is fairly short, e.g. typically less than  <dig> whereas the number genes involved ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  to overcome such a limitation, hirose et al.  <cit>  proposed a module-based gene network estimation which explores genetic networks of the transcriptional modules which are sets of genes sharing a common function or involved in the same path way rather than the use of gene level networks. the transcriptional modules may be considered as the groups of transcriptionally co-expressed genes. these transcriptional modules can be again mapped onto the gene-level networks. here, we employed this module-based approach for the estimation of temporal transcription regulation structure of a. fumigatus in heat shock with microarray data consisting of very short length of time point, i.e.,  <dig>  the time series microarray data reported by nierman et al.  <cit>  were used in this study. we also compared the temporal transcription regulation structures in two different heat shock conditions, i.e., shift from 30°c to 37°c and 48°c, respectively.

RESULTS
metabolic response of a. fumigatus to heat shock
to reduce the effect of missing values in time series microarray data of a. fumigatus in heat shock condition, the genes with over  <dig> % of missing values in total observations were excluded . thus,  <dig> and  <dig> genes from  <dig>  genes on the array were first chosen in this study for heat shock of 37°c and to 48°c, respectively. from these two gene lists, we selected the significantly differentially expressed genes showing over two fold change in expression level and below  <dig>  of p-value in t-test for at least a time point. here, we will call these genes heat shock response genes. finally, the number of heat shock response gene became  <dig> and  <dig> for heat shock of 37°c and 48°c, respectively. our study was focused on these heat shock response genes. eighty two percent  of heat response genes at 37°c were also observed in the set of heat response genes at 48°c. almost half these common genes were involved in the central metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate, amino acid and lipid metabolism .

for the more detail analysis, we examined the response of each metabolic pathway in each time point for these common heat response genes . the metabolic pathways showing the high sensitivity at the first time point  after heat shock were nucleotide metabolism including purine and pyrimidine and ribosome involved protein synthesis. especially, the response genes involved in ribosome were almost down-regulated throughout the time course in both heat shocks of 37°c and 48°c. the citrate cycle  genes were initially downregulated, but many of these genes were upregulated from  <dig> min and  <dig> min, respectively, after the heat shock of 37°c and 48°c. there are many metabolisms with positively regulated genes at  <dig> min after the heat shock of 37°c including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fructose/mannose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism including glycin, serine, threonine, histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. similar trend was also observed at  <dig> min after the heat shock of 48°c for metabolisms including pyruvate and amino acids such as valine, leucine and isoleucine as well as tca cycle. this might be related to the decrease of expression level of heat shock proteins other than afu8g <dig>  at  <dig> min and  <dig> min, respectively, after heat shock of 37°c and 48°c . considering overall metabolic response to heat shock, the heat shock of 48°c seems to bring more severe metabolic disturbance to the cells of a. fumigatus than that of 37°c.

identification of transcriptional module in heat shock response of a. fumigatus using state space model
we first identified the potential transcriptional modules, sets of genes that are co-regulated under heat shock condition, to map them on the gene-level network by state space model  . each module is assumed to follow the states of a first-order markov chain and a gene may belong to more than one module. the dimension of the state variable xn was chosen by k =  <dig> in this study . the regulation relationship between sub-modules are more clear than that between modules . we selected top-ranked  <dig> genes from all sub-modules including m1+, m1-, m2+ and m2- . the plus  and minus  module in each module usually have opposite expression pattern for each other. in heat shock of 37°c, four heat shock proteins including afu6g <dig> , afu5g <dig> , afu3g <dig>  and afu1g <dig>  appeared in m1+ while the other heat shock protein afu8g <dig>  was in m1-. this assignment of heat shock proteins to each sub-module shows a good agreement with their expression patterns . the expression pattern of afu8g <dig>  is unusual compared with those of other hsp70s including afu1g <dig>  and afu2g <dig>  . this suggests that the afu8g <dig> might have different function from general hsp <dig> which plays an important role in normalizing proteins degenerated by stress, and in maintaining the physiological functions of cells.

the heat shock proteins with similar expression pattern are assigned to same module. the average expression profiles of all heat response genes are shown at additional file  <dig> 

the regulation relationships among modules are shown in the lower part of figure  <dig>  the number of above arrow represents the strength of regulation while the positive and negative value indicates positive and negative regulation, respectively. module m <dig> containing heat shock proteins shows strong positive association with module m <dig> including many pathway genes in heat shock of 37°c while the module m <dig> including many pathway genes in heat shock of 48°c represents the strong positive self-regulation. this indicates that the regulation of metabolic gene by heat shock proteins might be stronger at heat shock of 37°c than at heat shock of 48°c.

transcription regulation structure of heat shock response genes in a. fumigatus
we estimated the transcription regulation structure by mapping the identified transcriptional modules in the above section onto the gene-level networks via the first order vector autoregression form . the edge density in the network of heat shock 37°c is always higher than that of 48°c over the threshold range surveyed . the reduction of edge density in higher temperature was reported by takemoto et al.  <cit> . they have suggested that with increasing temperature the metabolic networks undergo a change from heterogeneous and high-modular structures to homogeneous and low-modular structures like random networks. this suggests that the cells of a. fumigatus in the heat shock of 48°c might have less dense metabolic network than those in heat shock of 37°c. in our model, each element of the autoregressive coefficient matrix stands for interaction strength of corresponding gene pair . thus, the higher value it has, the stronger interaction the gene pair has. we can construct a sparse biological network by choosing a threshold. in this study, we have chosen a threshold of  <dig>  from the region showing almost constant edge density in both heat shock conditions of 37°c and 48°c . therefore, we obtained the two networks, one is composed of  <dig> edges and  <dig> genes at heat shock of 37°c and another consists of  <dig> edges and  <dig> genes at the heat shock of 48°c . the gene information corresponding to each node is shown at additional file  <dig>  the red and blue arrows represent positive and negative regulation, respectively. the direction of arrow indicates the regulation direction, i.e., from regulator gene to regulated or target gene. except for heat shock protein, the gene with more than twenty edges is called hub gene in this study which is indicated by grey and green node, respectively, in the networks of 37°c and 48°c. three heat shock proteins including  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  appeared in both networks of 37°c and 48°c while  <dig>  is observed only at network of 48°c. the gene number associated with the  <dig>  a single integral plasma membrane heat shock protein, dramatically increased at network of 48°c. this suggests that the  <dig> might have more critical role in the high temperature than in low temperature.

from the network, we can estimate possible regulation between heat shock response genes. for example, the regulation of  <dig>  by  <dig> in network of 48°c shows the possible regulation of trehalose production during heat shock condition. trehalose is known to accumulate at high levels to stress conditions  <cit> . the positive regulation of trehalose metabolism by  <dig> shows a good agreement with upregulation of afu3g <dig>  during time course at both heat shock conditions . many metabolic genes are targeted by heat shock proteins . it is interesting to notice that some of metabolic genes are playing the role as key regulator such as heat shock protein  <dig> . most of these metabolic genes represent clear contrast in their expression patterns with heat shock proteins and play role as hub nodes in the network . in terms of regulation, these metabolic genes seem to help the regulation of heat shock proteins. that is, the metabolic genes such as  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tend to positively regulate the genes negatively regulated by heat shock protein  <dig> at network of 37°c . the positive regulation of these metabolic genes towards target genes brings out the same effect as negative regulation by heat shock proteins towards the same target genes. this is mainly due to the opposite expression pattern between the metabolic gene and heat shock protein  <dig>  this coherent type of regulation could make it possible to maximize the regulation efficiency of heat shock proteins. the metabolic genes with similar function also appeared at the network of 48°c including  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

the underlined genes are metabolic genes and the signs '+' and '-' in the parenthesis represent positive and negative associations with heat shock protein, respectively.

to more clarification of the regulation structure between heat shock proteins and hub metabolic genes, we extracted a small network including heat shock proteins, hub metabolic genes and transcription factors from network of figure  <dig>  the heat shock protein  <dig> and a metabolic gene  <dig> show coherent feed-forward loop  type of regulation against metabolic gene  <dig> . the ffl is composed of first regulator that regulates a second regulator, and both regulators regulate the same target. in this network, the  <dig> negatively regulates both  <dig> and  <dig> where  <dig> again positively regulates  <dig>  the indirect regulation of  <dig> towards  <dig> through  <dig> gives finally the same effect of negative regulation by  <dig> towards  <dig>  thus, the expression of  <dig> will be easily downregulated by both regulations of  <dig> and  <dig>  the coherent ffl type of regulation is also shown in the network of 48°c . there are four types of coherent ffl in network including  <dig> nodes . the network in figure  <dig> shows that the heat shock protein  <dig> employs the type  <dig> of coherent ffl which can act as a response accelerator for the regulation of target genes. this indicates that heat shock protein rapidly and efficiently regulates target genes by the type  <dig> of coherent ffl with hub metabolic genes. considering a ffl including first regulator  <dig>  second regulator  <dig> and target  <dig> , the second regulator  <dig> shows positive auto-regulation. a positive auto-regulation gives slow response time in expression change, but the state of once changed expression can be maintained, even after its regulator has vanished  <cit> . this type of positive auto-regulation might help the cells of a. fumigatus to keep the heat shock mode for a time after removal of heat shock.

the regulation of transcription factor  <dig>  at network of 37°c towards other genes may be result of indirect regulation through other intermediate genes hidden. unlikely to the network of 37°c, many transcription factors appeared at the network of 48°c including  <dig> ),  <dig> ,  <dig> ) and  <dig>  .  <dig> and  <dig> were downregulated while  <dig> and  <dig> were strongly upregulated during time course at the heat shock of 48°c . the relationship of these transcription factors with other metabolic genes might be the reflection of indirect interaction rather than direct regulation through other intermediate genes hidden. the expression patterns of the c <dig> sexual development transcription factor  <dig> and heat shock protein  <dig> show clear contrast. this suggests that the positive regulation by  <dig> towards a target gene brings the same effect as the negative regulation by  <dig> towards the same target gene. in fact, half of metabolic genes negatively regulated by  <dig> are positively regulated by  <dig> .

the absence of heat shock transcription factor in the networks is due to its lower interaction value with other genes than threshold. both heat shock conditions, the heat shock transcription factor  showed upregulation like most of heat shock proteins during time course . the metabolic genes in two extracted networks of 37°c and 48°c are different, but the ffl type  <dig> of regulation structure including heat shock proteins and metabolic genes is well-conserved in both networks. this suggests that the ffl type  <dig> of regulation structure is important network motif in the thermal adaptation process. the frequency of this network motif decreased with increasing temperature. that is, the ffl type  <dig> of regulation structure was more frequent at network of 37°c than at network of 48°c. this indicates that the regulation efficiency of heat shock proteins would be reduced at heat shock of 48°c, which might be related to dramatic increase in the expression level of heat shock proteins and the number of heat shock response genes at heat shock of 48°c.

discussion
it is widely accepted that biological systems are composed of functional modules with specific combinations of genes and proteins responsible for different biological functions  <cit> . the module can be considered as the temporal activity of a group of genes/proteins that controls a specific function in different environmental conditions. in this study, we identified the transcriptional module of heat response genes of a. fumigatus using ssm with the state dimension of k =  <dig>  the genes with similar expression profile are successfully assigned to the same module. the estimated gene regulation structure based on identified module showed clearly the negative relationship between heat shock proteins and metabolic genes. our analysis suggests that the metabolic genes as well as heat shock proteins might be used as key regulator in the thermal adaptation process of a. fumigatus. especially, the metabolic genes with opposite expression pattern of heat shock proteins have a propensity to be involved in coherent ffl type  <dig> of regulation with heat shock proteins in the transcriptional network .

the coherent ffl type  <dig> of regulation could make it possible to rapidly and efficiently adapt the cells of a. fumigatus to the change of temperature. for example, small amount of heat shock proteins can efficiently regulate the target genes. however, this type of regulation at heat shock of 48°c seems to be weak due to the reduction of metabolic genes showing coherent regulation with heat shock proteins. this might be related to dramatic increase in the amount of heat shock proteins and the number of heat shock response genes at heat shock of 48°c. takemoto et al.  <cit>  surveyed the dependence of the structure of metabolic networks in prokaryotes on their growth temperature. they found that the edge density becomes small, the clustering-coefficient-based modularity of the networks become small, and the frequency of recurring sub-graphs decays with increasing growth temperature. although these findings are concerned with metabolic network, they show a good agreement with our results in terms of network structure. besides edge density, the decrease of coherent ffl type  <dig> of regulation including heat shock protein at 48°c could be related to the fact that the frequency of recurring sub-graphs or network motifs decays with increasing temperature. thus, the thermal adaptation process of a. fumigatus could be considered as change of network structure such as transition from metabolic network of mesophile into that of thermophile. this suggests that the network of 48°c might be optimal in the temperature for the survival of a. fumigatus even if it looks like less efficiently than the network of 37°c. especially, in heat shock of 48°c many pathogenic genes such as afu4g <dig>  and afu6g <dig>  are appeared as heat response genes and these genes are upregulated at all time points except for  <dig> min . this indicates that the cells of a. fumigatus at heat shock of 48°c might be more pathogenic than those at heat shock of 37°c.

our results suggest for the first time that the thermal tolerance of a. fumigatus might be due to the efficient regulation of metabolic genes by heat shock proteins taking coherent ffl type  <dig> of regulation structure. we analysed the network at a fixed threshold of  <dig> , but this type of regulation was well conserved at various thresholds. thus, the network analysed in this study would be sufficient for the capturing transcriptional regulation characteristic of a. fumigatus in the thermal adaptation process.

CONCLUSIONS
the understanding of thermal adaptation mechanism in the opportunistic pathogen a. fumigatus is important in fungal infectiology. we estimated the transcriptional regulation structure of a. fumigatus under heat shock conditions using time series microarray data with very short length of time point, i.e.,  <dig>  we propose a thermal adaptation mechanism of a. fumigatus through heat shock proteins, which might efficiently regulate their target genes using the coherent ffl type  <dig> of regulation structure. this type of regulation structure would also be efficient cellular strategy for other stressful conditions requiring rapid change of metabolic mode.
