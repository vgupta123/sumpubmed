BACKGROUND
a hallmark of mycobacterium tuberculosis  is its ability to establish and maintain a latent infection capable of resuming growth after long periods of time during which no clinical symptoms of disease are evident. this substantial reservoir of latent infections with the potential for relapse to active disease and transmission presents a significant obstacle for successful disease management. compounding this issue is the limited number of treatment options for chronic tuberculosis infections. accordingly, there is a considerable need for new anti-tuberculosis therapeutics capable of treating both chronic and acute infections. however, before new drugs with novel modes of action can be developed more information about the coordination of adaptive metabolism associated with latency needs to be obtained.

the transition from rapid growth to the non-replicating persistent state  that is characteristic of chronic tuberculosis infection involves the downshift of multiple biological processes and a remodeled and reduced metabolism  <cit> . previous studies utilizing in vitro models of mtb nrp indicate the transition into this state occurs at a specific point during the bacterial cell cycle  <cit> . while these experimental observations highlight the required coordination of cell cycle progression with cessation of growth and metabolic shutdown, the precise regulatory mechanisms coupling cell cycle regulation with downstream global metabolic remodeling remain undefined.

regulation of the cell cycle at the point of septum formation is a key checkpoint in coordinating bacterial stress responses and for transition into nrp  <cit> . the sos response, which prevents cell cycle progression in response to dna damage and other stresses, is a classic example of cell division regulation under conditional stress  <cit> . although proteins that regulate septum formation have been widely characterized in other bacterial species, proteins that carry out this function have not all been identified or thoroughly characterized in mtb <cit> . a previous study from our laboratory identified a septum site determining protein, ssd, and showed that it is capable of regulating septum formation and inducing alternative metabolic pathways, demonstrating a relationship between the regulation of cell cycle progression and the induction of molecular programs associated with nrp  <cit> .

there is growing evidence that genome encoded toxin:antitoxin  loci have important roles in mtb biology and they are increasingly being associated with stress responses. ta loci encode an unstable antitoxin immediately upstream of a toxin and these proteins form a complex with one another under optimal growth conditions. this interaction prevents the toxin from exerting its effects on the specific cellular process it targets  <cit> . several environmental stresses are known to result in the selective degradation of the antitoxin and accumulation of free toxin  <cit> . of the  <dig> putative ta systems encoded in the mtb genome, many have been shown to be responsive to hypoxia, participate in growth transitions, contribute to virulence, and regulate growth in macrophages or in sputum  <cit> . yet, their regulation, coordination and specific contributions to the many stressful states encountered by mtb are not fully understood  <cit> .

because of the large number of genome encoded ta loci, and lack of information about their regulation and interaction with other members of ta loci, our objective was to identify a cell cycle regulatory component, that was part of an alternative response that included ta loci, and to asses the interaction of the ta loci components. in this study, we identify sojmtb encoded by rv <dig> as a cell cycle regulatory protein that governs cell cycle progression at the point of septum formation and elicits a complex adaptive response that includes the mazef <dig> ta loci of mtb. the mazf <dig> toxin is capable of inducing bacteriostasis that can be inhibited by interaction with its cognate antitoxin, maze <dig>  the mazef <dig> ta pair form a stable protein complex and mazf <dig> is not capable of interacting with non-cognate antitoxins. this is the first report of a coupled regulatory system consisting of a cell cycle regulator, sojmtb, and a ta locus, that are involved in a global adaptive response ultimately associated with the transition into the nrp state of mtb.

RESULTS
orf rv <dig> encodes a soj-like protein in mtb
previously, we used transcriptional mapping to assign rv <dig>  originally annotated as a putative initiation inhibition protein, as a septum formation regulatory protein  <cit> . to improve the functional assignment of rv <dig>  a bioinformatics approach using a consensus sequence derived from alignments of proteins with an annotated function of septum inhibition was employed. this substantiated the functional assignment of rv <dig> as encoding a septum regulatory protein because of shared similarity with the septum regulatory protein mind. septum inhibiting proteins, including mind and soj proteins, belong to the same family of p-loop atpases  <cit> . to narrow the functional assignment of rv <dig> we used the phyre <dig> protein homology engine, which successfully revealed that rv <dig> shares greater sequence identity to soj proteins  than to true mind proteins . alignments of the rv <dig> protein with soj and mind consensus models, orthologous matrix  groups  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, revealed that rv <dig> shares soj-specific dna-binding residues while lacking the hydrophobic c-terminal aliphatic helical extension that is involved in membrane association and is characteristic of mind proteins  <cit>  . together, these analyses improve the functional annotation and indicate that rv <dig> encodes an alternative soj protein, referred to here as sojmtb.

overexpression of soj
mtb
 regulates cell cycle progression and acts prior to septum formation
to assess whether sojmtb is involved in regulation of cell cycle progression, we performed gene dosage experiments. overexpression of soj
mtb
 caused a decrease in growth in mycobacterium smegmatis and mtb compared to the vector control strain . to visualize alterations in cellular morphology due to overexpression of soj
mtb
, mycobacterial cells were imaged using electron microscopy . these studies revealed that overexpression of soj
mtb
 in m. smegmatis and mtb produced similar elongated cell phenotypes with a predominant ultra-structural morphology absent of concentric rings indicative of septa. this elongated cell phenotype is consistent with previous studies performed in m. smegmatis <cit> . the absence of septa is characteristic of regulation of ftsz polymerization prior to z-ring formation  <cit> . together, these data indicate that sojmtb reduces the frequency of septum formation and governs cell cycle progression prior to septum formation.

mazf <dig> toxin is elicited by sojmtb
to assess the involvement of sojmtb in eliciting alternative adaptive responses, the global transcriptional response of mtb upon overexpression of soj
mtb
 was investigated through whole genome dna microarray analysis. a total of  <dig>  genes from all functional categories displayed a  <dig>  fold or greater change in expression  in the mtb merodiploid strain compared to the vector alone control strain . the microarray data analysis revealed that sojmtb is part of a large alternative stress response based on the induction of alternative sigma factors sigh, sigg, sigl, sigm, sigi in response to overexpression of soj
mtb
. the pleotropic nature of this transcriptional response is likely the result of the induction of these alternative sigma factors, several of which have been shown to regulate stress response pathways  <cit> . notably, rv1991c encoding the mazf <dig> toxin of the mazef <dig> ta loci showed significant change in expression.

the mazf <dig> toxin is the most well characterized out of nine predicted maz-family ta loci encoded in the mtb genome  <cit> . molecular studies have demonstrated that the mazf <dig> is an endoribonuclease that cleaves aca mrna sequences, and that this activity is inhibited by interaction with the maze <dig> antitoxin  <cit> . mazf <dig> is thought to induce rapid changes in the transcriptome due to its endoribonuclease activity, allowing coupling of cell cycle inhibition by sojmtb and the transcriptional remodeling associated with the transition into an alternative state such as nrp.

we compared the soj
mtb
 response with previously described programs associated with nrp in order to determine if there was overlap in the transcriptional responses. overlap was determined by taking into account the number of genes in the given transcriptional response in relation to the number of genes in the genome  to determine the number of genes that would be shared only by chance, as described previously  <cit> . there was no significant degree of overlap between the up-regulated genes of the soj
mtb
 response and the dos-response or ehr , and in fact, the dos-response was actively down-regulated . however, there was significant overlap between the soj
mtb
 response and the “non-culturable” response, with  <dig> up-regulated genes in common, the mazef <dig> transcript among them.

maze <dig> and mazf <dig> functionally and physically interact
to better understand the functional role of maz-family ta pairs, we sought to characterize the functionality and interaction of maze <dig> and mazf <dig>  when expressed in vivo, the mazf <dig> toxin induces bacteriostasis, while expression of maze <dig> causes no stalling of bacterial growth . importantly, this bacteriostatic phenotype can be rescued when the toxin and antitoxin are co-expressed thus demonstrating a functional interaction in vivo . to show a physical interaction between these two recombinant proteins, co-purification was performed and protein identity was confirmed via western blot and mass spectrometry. when both antitoxin and toxin are produced individually and subject to metal affinity chromatography, maze6-his is present in the elution fraction, while mazf6-hsv is present in the unbound flow and wash fraction, indicating that it is not retained in the affinity column . in contrast, when co-expressed, mazf6-hsv elutes primarily with maze6-his indicating that they physically interact in vivo and that the bacteriostatic phenotype associated with overproduction of mazf <dig> can be prevented by its interaction with its cognate antitoxin, maze <dig> . western blot analysis was confirmed by in-gel trypsin digestion of the gel fragment corresponding to the recombinant mazef <dig> complex and identification by ltq mass spectrometry. mazef <dig> were among the top hits returned when searched against the ncbinr database for eubacteria. maze <dig> was identified with 70% coverage with  <dig> non-duplicate peptides, and mazf <dig> was identified with 95% coverage and  <dig> non-duplicate peptides.

to determine if there is any degree of functional redundancy among the numerous mazef loci in mtb, we assessed the interactions between mazf <dig> and non-cognate maze antitoxins. functional redundancy was assessed by the ability of non-cognate maze antitoxins to prevent bacteriostasis induced by mazf <dig>  growth arrest due to mazf6-hsv production was not rescued by co-production of non-cognate maze-his antitoxins . the mazf <dig> antitoxin encoded by rv2274a was not tested because it is absent in some clinical strains of mtb <cit> . co-purification was also performed and with all pairs tested, mazf6-hsv was only able to physically interact with its cognate antitoxin, maze <dig> . our data confirm that the mazf <dig> toxin does not interact with non-cognate maze antitoxins in vivo indicating that there may be little functional redundancy across mazef pairs.

toxin with cognate and non-cognate antitoxins

growth reduction associated with overexpression of the mazf <dig> toxin can be rescued by co-expression of its cognate antitoxin. full rescue of the growth defect is not observed when co-expressed with non-cognate antitoxins.

soj
mtb
 and mazef <dig> are expressed in bacteria in the lungs and spleen of mtb infected mice
adaptations resulting in a nrp state have been associated with the execution of complex and complementary molecular programs designed to allow the cell to survive the stresses experienced within the host  <cit> . these include programs to slow bacterial growth, induce alternative metabolic pathways, and to withstand acid, hypoxic, nutrient and additional stresses. ta loci have been associated with stress responses in bacteria and are becoming the focus of increasing efforts to elucidate their contributions to alternative states in vivo <cit> .

in order to determine if sojmtb and mazef <dig> play a role during infection, we assessed their transcriptional activity during the infectious processes using the established mouse model of infection  <cit> . quantitative-pcr was used to assess soj
mtb
 and mazef <dig> abundance in cdna obtained from in vitro mid-log phase cultures, and the lungs and spleen at  <dig>   <dig> and 100 days post-infection . the analyses revealed an overall difference in expression patterns and overall abundance of soj
mtb
 and the mazef <dig> loci as compared to in vitro grown bacteria. soj
mtb
 was abundant at day  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the transcriptional response in the lungs was characterized by a significant difference in the transcriptional abundance of maze <dig> and mazf <dig> at day  <dig>  while this difference in the abundance of maze <dig> and mazf <dig> was not noted at days  <dig> and  <dig> . similarly to the transcriptional pattern observed at day  <dig> in the lungs, in the spleen soj
mtb
 was abundant at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and there was a two log or greater difference in the abundance between maze <dig> and mazf <dig> throughout the course of infection . the observed transcriptional abundances observed between maze <dig> and mazf <dig> is consistent with observations of ta loci in other systems  <cit> . specifically, only the toxin component of several ta loci were identified in mtb in a human macrophage model of late stage infection  <cit> . the transcriptional activity of soj
mtb
, and maze <dig> and mazf <dig> in bacteria obtained from infected tissues indicate that mazf <dig> is important throughout the course of infection, and is uniquely temporally functional in facilitating adaptations to the alternative environments encountered during infection.

discussion
the establishment of the nrp state requires the coordination of several important cellular processes. these include the halting of cell cycle progression at the point of septum formation, induction of alternative metabolic pathways, and coordination of multiple regulatory mechanisms, including ta loci, in modulating this adaptive response. previous studies have observed that during macrophage infection, as well as under in vitro models of nrp, the bacteria are observed as multinucleoidal smooth filaments, indicating the transition into nrp occurs after chromosomal replication but prior to formation of the z-ring septal precursor  <cit> . although proteins that carry out this function in mtb have not all been identified or characterized, we predicted that they must be present in the mtb genome, as this is a critical checkpoint in the cell cycle. homology searches for cell division regulators known to act by inhibiting septum formation identified rv <dig> . septum inhibiting proteins including mind, para and soj, show extensive similarity while participating in a variety of different cellular processes  <cit> . homology models and local sequence alignments confirm that rv <dig> encodes a soj-like, rather than mind-like protein, as it contains the non-specific dna-binding residues highly conserved in soj proteins but lacking in mind proteins  <cit> . while soj and chromosomal para proteins are considered to be equivalent in respect to their roles in chromosome segregation, soj proteins play an important role in the regulation of sporulation-specific gene expression and entry into stationary phase  <cit> . previously, studies conducted in m. smegmatis reported that rv <dig> encodes a para homolog  <cit> . however, based on genomic context, we do not believe that the protein encoded by rv <dig> contributes significantly to chromosomal segregation as para.

together, our bioinformatic analysis and morphological studies indicate a role in regulating cell division and demonstrate that sojmtb performs a role in mtb that is analogous to soj proteins described in other bacteria. sojmtb regulates the expression of a subset of genes that act to establish a state of low metabolic activity and reduced growth rate along with increasing adaptive functions required for entry into nrp. transcriptional analyses of mtb under a variety of conditions have uncovered several molecular programs that have been extensively linked to the nrp state of mtb including the dos  response, the enduring hypoxic response  and the “non-culturable” transitional state  <cit> . our previous studies have demonstrated that septum site determining protein ssd causes the induction of alternative metabolic pathways, including the dos regulon, further illustrating an intimate coordination of cell cycle progression with induction of molecular programs associated with nrp  <cit> .

upon overexpression of soj
mtb
, alternative sigma factors sigh, sigg, sigl, sigm, sigi, and sigb are up-regulated. the pleotropic nature of this transcriptional response is likely the result of the induction of these alternative sigma factors, several of which have been shown to regulate stress response pathways  <cit> . in addition to the up-regulation of alternative sigma factors, the greatest increase in gene expression is seen for rv1991c, encoding the mazf <dig> toxin. a  <dig> study characterized the transition to nrp by evaluating the “non-culturable” phenotype that has been associated with dormancy in mtb <cit> . notably, mazf <dig> was significantly up-regulated in this physiological model. in fact, there is significant overlap in the differential expression patterns between the “non-culturable” response and the response observed upon overexpression of soj
mtb
. there was no significant degree of overlap between the up-regulated genes of the soj
mtb
 response and the dos response or ehr, and in fact, the dos response was actively down-regulated. the dos response contributes to the preparation of mtb for nrp, while the ehr contributes to the maintenance of nrp  <cit> . although the dos response has been shown to aid in the adaptation to low oxygen state associated with nrp, mutants in the response have shown varying degrees of phenotypes and suggest that it does not play as prominent a role in nrp as once thought  <cit> . this further supports the role of the soj
mtb
 response in preparing the bacterium for alternative conditions in a manner that is distinct from the preparation elicited by the dos response. therefore, we posit that mazf <dig> functions to facilitate the transition into nrp. likely, the endoribonuclease activity of mazf <dig> is utilized to erase the existing transcriptome to free cellular machinery to produce transcripts needed for successful entry into nrp.

currently, there are nine predicted maz-family ta loci encoded in the mtb genome  <cit> . despite a number of reports, the information about the interaction of cognate and non-cognate maz-family ta pairs is limited  <cit> . in this study we have demonstrated that the mazf <dig> toxin is capable of inducing bacteriostasis and that this state can be inhibited by interaction with its cognate antitoxin, maze <dig>  in addition, we have confirmed a physical interaction between these two proteins by purifying the proteins in complex from live cells. we have also shown that the interaction is specific and that mazf <dig> is not capable of interacting with non-cognate antitoxins. this suggests that although there are a high number of ta loci in mtb, cross-talk via interaction is unlikely to occur, at least among this family of ta pairs. the identification of both soj
mtb
 and mazef <dig> transcripts in bacteria isolated from the lungs and spleen of infected mice further supports the role of soj
mtb
 and this toxin in facilitating the transition to alternative host environments through a coupled regulatory mechanism. the unique differential temporal profile of transcriptional abundance of the mazef <dig> polycistron throughout the host infection is concordant with previous observations. post-transcriptional regulation of ta loci that are co-transcribed is a complex dynamic phenomenon that results in the accumulation of the toxin component of the bicistronic mrna during times of environmental stress. a study of mtb during human macrophage infection identified only the toxin component of several ta orthologs during late stage infection  <cit> . similarly, a study in e. coli substantiated post-transcriptional modification of endogenous mazef mrna in the presence of rele toxin resulting in the accumulation of mazf toxin mrna  <cit> . together with previous reports, our data indicate that regulation of ta loci is not strictly occurring at the post-translational level but also at the post-transcriptional level.

CONCLUSIONS
all environmental conditions or cellular processes that induce the accumulation of the toxin component of ta loci or the specific phenotypes that results have not been fully elucidated. the identification of sojmtb, whose overproduction elicits the induction of this particular toxin loci, links the halting of cell division prior to the point of septum formation to molecular programs associated with alternative responses. mazf <dig> is strongly up-regulated upon overproduction of sojmtb, suggesting that the regulation of cell division and its eventual halting is facilitated through the action of this toxin. this is the first report of a coupled regulatory system that links cell cycle regulation by sojmtb molecular programs associated with adaptation to stress in mtb via the activity of mazef <dig> ta loci. importantly, this information provides a foundation for further analysis of how ta loci are coordinated with regards to other essential cellular processes and to define their contribution to the establishment of the nrp state of mtb.
