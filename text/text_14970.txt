BACKGROUND
extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli  are a specific group of e. coli that cause a diverse spectrum of invasive infections in animals and humans often leading to septicemia  <cit> . among the typical extraintestinal infections caused by expec in humans are urinary tract infections , which are a major public health concern in developed countries costing healthcare systems billions of dollars annually  <cit> . similarly, colibacillosis, caused by avian expec isolates , is an economically devastating disease to poultry industries worldwide  <cit> .

both apec and human expec, implicated in utis , are similar in that they both possess a common set of virulence markers such as various adhesins, iron uptake systems, complement resistance traits, and invasins  <cit> . however, no single virulence factor has been shown to be specifically unique to, or definitive of, upec or apec, suggesting that these expec might lack host specificity. intriguingly, some of the virulence genes that occur on apec's plasmids  and pathogenicity islands   also occur on plasmids and pais of upec  <cit> . a growing body of evidence suggests that apec could be a possible source of upec causing utis or other diseases in human beings  <cit> . similarly, e. coli plasmids may serve as reservoirs of resistance or virulence genes for human expec  <cit> , and apec plasmids contribute to uropathogenicity of e. coli in mice  <cit> . on the other hand, upec and apec may be armed with specific genes that determine their specificity to a particular host  or niche .

to better evaluate the relationship between apec and upec, a comparative analysis of apec and upec genomes is important. such studies might also clarify evolutionary relationships between these two expecs and identify genes that decide vital differences in virulence and host specificity. several pcr-based dna subtraction methods have been used for the detection of genetic differences between two closely related genomes and subsequent identification of genes responsible for bacterial virulence  <cit> . here, we describe the use of genomic suppressive subtractive hybridization  to compare apec and upec strains in order to determine if they harbor host and/or site-specific dna sequences. four sshs were run in the present study using two apec isolates and two upec isolates. well characterized apec o <dig> and upec cft <dig> strains were included in the study to determine the known apec- and upec-specific sequences that may involved in the disease process . two other strains, apec  <dig> and upec  <dig> that harbor a common set of virulence genes, were included to look for hitherto unknown genes that are implicated in apec and upec pathogenicity  <cit> . each apec and upec strain was used as both driver and tester strains in order to obtain both apec- and upec-specific subtraction fragments . additionally, we examined a collection of apec and upec isolates with pcr to understand the distribution of these sfs among expec.

RESULTS
characteristics of the strains used for the study
several methods such as the embryo lethality assay  and the day-old chicken challenge model using intratracheal , subcutaneous , intravenous  and intramuscular  routes of inoculation have been used extensively to assess the virulence of avian e. coli  <cit> . the ela is a simple method that can be used to discriminate between virulent and avirulent apec strains  <cit> . we used this method to characterize the four isolates that served as driver and tester strains in this study. as determined by chick embryos challenge, apec o <dig>  apec  <dig>  upec cft <dig> and upec  <dig> were identified as virulent . while ela results correlate with that of sc, iv and im day-old challenge models, they do not correlate with the it challenge model  <cit> . therefore, we further characterized these apec strains with the it challenge model  <cit> . this model, which categorized apec into  <dig> groups, highly pathogenic, intermediate pathogenic or low pathogenic on the basis of deaths and macroscopic lesions, demonstrated that apec o <dig> is highly pathogenic while apec  <dig> falls in the intermediate pathogenic group .

phylogenetic analysis using triplex pcr has shown that e. colistrains can be grouped into four main phylogenetic groups, namely, a, b <dig>  b <dig>  and d. virulent expec strains are said to belong mainly to group b <dig> and, to a lesser extent, to group d, whereas most commensal e. coli strains belong to group a  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  all four e. coli strains used for ssh belonged to the b <dig> phylogenetic group. of the  <dig> upec isolates used for the gene prevalence studies, the majority  fell into one of the virulence-associated phylogenetic groups, b <dig>  or d ; whereas, only 16% belonged to the other two phylogenetic groups . however, of the  <dig> apec isolates used for gene prevalence studies, 36%, 11%, 22% and 26% of strains belonged to phylogenetic groups a, b <dig>  b <dig> and d, respectively . several recent studies reported similar results for apec, suggesting that predictions about the virulence of apec strains cannot be based merely on chromosomal differences, as used in this typing procedure  <cit> . plasmid pais have a strong association with apec's capacity to cause disease and will likely need to be given due consideration when typing apec isolates  <cit> .

multilocus sequence typing  provides a novel approach to molecular epidemiology and strengthens our understanding of phylogenetic distribution of infectious disease agents  <cit> . further, mlst data can be transferred between laboratories around the globe via the web-accessible databases. mlst of driver and tester strains revealed that the two apec strains belong to the st <dig> complex and two upec strains belong to the st <dig> complex as defined by the publicly available e. coli mlst database . by comparison with this database, the two upec and two apec strains used as driver and tester strains in this study were found to be phylogenetically related to each other.

sequence analysis of tester-specific fragments
four subtracted libraries of tester strains were constructed for four different sshs with the aim of identifying genomic differences between apec and upec. four sshs yielded a total of  <dig> tester-specific clones. after amputation of the vector sequences and regions of low quality ,  <dig> sequences  remained and were regarded as valid sfs. of these  <dig> sfs,  <dig> sequences were discarded due to redundancy  or because they were present in the e. coli k <dig> genome. the remaining  <dig> sfs ranged in size from 121– <dig> bp. using the blast program, a search for similarity with these sequences was undertaken . additionally, these sfs were used as targets in subsequent sequence prevalence studies. of the  <dig> tester-specific sfs,  <dig> were apec o1-derived ,  <dig> were upec cft073-derived ,  <dig> were apec 113-derived , and  <dig> were upec 88-derived . the sfs were further categorized as sequences that have previously described functions; similarity to phage/prophage sequences; encode hypothetical proteins; or lack similarity to any of the genes in published databases. ssh <dig> yielded  <dig> sfs that corresponded to genes with known functions ,  <dig> sfs that are parts of genes with putative or unknown functions , and  <dig> sfs that are unique to apec o <dig> strain. of the  <dig> cft073-derived sfs obtained from ssh <dig>   <dig> sequences corresponded to genes that encode hypothetical proteins and another  <dig> to the genes encoding proteins with known functions. all  <dig> cft073-borne sfs were located on the chromosome including  <dig> that showed similarity to phages or prophages. among the sfs of ssh <dig>   <dig> fragments did not show similarity to any known sequences,  <dig> showed similarity to genes with known functions , and  <dig> showed similarity to genes with unknown or putative functions . of the  <dig> sfs obtained from ssh <dig>   <dig> chromosomal-located sfs showed similarity to genes with hypothetical functions,  <dig> had similarity to genes with known functions , while  <dig> sequence was unique to the driver strain upec  <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> apec-derived sfs matched to plasmid regions, where only  <dig> of upec-derived fragments did, suggesting that plasmids may play a more prominent role in apec virulence than they do in upec. further, the presence of plasmid sequences, phage/prophage sequences, integrases, recombinases, and transposases among the sfs strongly support the already established theory of evolution of bacterial pathogenicity through horizontal gene transfer and genetic recombination

prevalence of sfs among apec and upec
the prevalence of sfs among a collection of apec and upec is summarized . there was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of  <dig> apec-derived sfs among apec and upec out of a total of  <dig> apec-derived sfs. none of the apec-derived fragments that were present in more than 10% of apec tested was limited only to apec. however, certain apec o1-derived sfs could be traced back to a pai located on a large plasmid in apec o <dig>  papec-o1-colbm  <cit> . these fragments included traa and trac , tsh , and sopb  occurred significantly more often in apec than in upec. similarly, the apec 113-derived sf b <dig> that matched cvab of papec-o2-colv was present in 63% of the apec, while only 7% of upec carried the sequence  <cit> . the cvab is a gene located in the colv operon  <cit> , and tra genes encode for plasmid transfer proteins  <cit> . the tsh, which encodes the temperature-sensitive hemagglutinin , is involved in development of air sac lesions of birds during colibacillosis  <cit> , highly prevalent among apec, carried by highly pathogenic strains of apec, and considered to be an apec virulence marker  <cit> . however, a previous report indicates that a gene homologue to tsh is present in upec cft <dig> though it is less conserved relative to its counterpart in apec  <cit> . the apec-o <dig> derived sf a <dig> obtained from ssh <dig> showed 100% homology to a region of tsh of apec-o1-colbm but matched to a region that is less conserved in tsh homologies from other pathogens. interestingly, apec 113-derived fragments, b <dig> and b <dig>  which showed 100% similarity to two different regions of the putative phosphotransferase system encoded by an apec gimb genetic island, were present predominantly in upec  rather than in apec  .

in contrast, most of the upec-derived fragments were present at a higher rate in upec than in apec. yet, many of these sfs contained genes that encode putative or hypothetical proteins, making it difficult to directly relate them to upec pathogenicity. functional assays coupled with construction of isogenic mutants of such genes followed by subsequent testing in experimental infection models will likely provide new insight into upec pathogenicity and lead to discovery of previously unknown upec virulence mechanisms. intriguingly, the sfs, u <dig>  u20/u <dig>  which matched to the foc gene cluster, encoding the f1c fimbrial major and minor subunit precursors, and u <dig>  which corresponds to the hlyd gene, were exclusively present in upec. f1c fimbriae, which lack hemagglutination properties, are known to mediate specific adherence of upec to the collecting ducts and distal tubules of the human kidney  <cit> . the hlyd gene, a well known upec virulence marker, is present on pais in at least in some upec strains  <cit> . the hly operon of upec consists of four genes: hlya, hlyb, hlyc, and hlyd  <cit> . although this operon is known to be present in cft <dig> and thought to be absent in these apec strains, this study did not detect any upec-derived sequences with similarity to hly genes other than hlyd, perhaps due to inappropriate fragment sizes yielded with the restriction enzymes used in the present study. two upec 88-derived fragments, c <dig> and c <dig>  which matched to regions of the usp gene that encodes the uropathogenic-specific protein, were present predominantly in upec rather than in apec. although usp was thought to be uropathogenic-specific and a virulence marker of upec  <cit> , a small percentage of apec contained the gene revealing that it is not strictly specific to upec.

previously, we carried out ssh between apec o <dig> and a commensal e. coli strain isolated from feces of a healthy chicken  <cit> . this study demonstrated that genes, encoding the tia invasion determinant protein, the iron-responsive element , p pili, and aldo-keto reductase are more common in apec and upec than in avian commensal e. coli. however, neither this study, nor the present one, detected a single trait that was unequivocally present in all the upec or all the apec tested. had such traits been detected, we would have suspected that they were involved in host and/or niche specificity of these two expec. we suggest that delineating the functions of hypothetical and unknown proteins of upec and apec would strengthen this conclusion and add to our current understanding of expec pathogenesis.

to the authors' knowledge, this is the first study comparing apec and upec genomes using ssh to explore their differences and similarities and to identify apec- and upec-specific genes that may be involved in expec pathogenicity in different hosts and niches. when this study was conducted, the genome sequence of apec o <dig>  was not completed. since the genome sequence of this strain is now publicly available, direct comparison of apec o <dig> and human expec genomes  can be used to facilitate identification of apec- and upec-specific genes. however, it is remarkable that the present study identified  <dig> apec o1-specific, hitherto unknown sequences  that are absent from the other apec isolates tested.

CONCLUSIONS
ssh between apec and upec identified some genes that are already known to be associated with the virulence of these two pathogens. some of the upec-derived genes encode putative or hypothetical proteins. delineation of their functions might reveal factors that determine host and/or niche specificity. this study also confirmed the findings of others that apec virulence is commonly associated with plasmid-linked genes  <cit> . none of the sfs were present in almost all the isolates screened, and it is apparent that both pathogens use a combination of virulence factors to establish disease in the host.
