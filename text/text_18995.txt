BACKGROUND
as a common by-product of natural fermentation, alcohol has been an integral part of human culture since early recorded history. the inebriating effects of alcohol have been recorded since biblical times. in today’s society, excessive alcohol consumption is the most widespread substance abuse problem with substantial socioeconomic impact.

different human populations vary in alcohol consumption and in susceptibility to the physiological effects of alcohol, as do individuals within populations . the extent to which individuals develop tolerance to the physiological effects of alcohol is a contributing factor to the development of addiction. studies on genetic susceptibility to the physiological effects of alcohol in human populations have mostly focused on aspects of addiction. linkage and association studies for candidate genes  as well as genome-wide analyses  have implicated neurotransmitter systems associated with the mesolimbic reward pathway and enzymes that contribute to alcohol metabolism. however, results from genome-wide association  studies in people, as well as information from studies on animal models, indicate that additional regulatory processes are involved in alcohol addiction and that the genetic architecture that predisposes individuals to addiction is complex .

although addiction is undeniably an important alcohol-related phenotype, acute intoxication is a major contributor to the socioeconomic costs of alcohol abuse. few studies have focused on acute alcohol sensitivity within the range of normal alcohol intake across a population. disentangling the genetic and environmental contributions that shape alcohol-related phenotypes in human populations is challenging because alcohol exposure and other contributing environmental factors cannot be controlled. further complications arise because different studies have utilized different measurements to document alcohol-related phenotypes. partitioning the relative contributions of genotype, ethanol exposure and the interaction between genotype and environment is more readily accomplished in animal models in which both the genetic background and environment can be controlled and alcohol-related phenotypes quantified accurately. based on the principle of evolutionary conservation, animal models can provide general insights in fundamental biological processes affected by alcohol exposure .

drosophila melanogaster provides such a model. assays have been developed to precisely quantify sensitivity to alcohol by measuring alcohol-induced knock-down time  <cit> , and flies exposed to ethanol undergo physiological and behavioral changes that resemble human alcohol intoxication  <cit> . previous studies on alcohol sensitivity in drosophila have identified cyclic amp signaling  <cit> , alcohol metabolism   and malic enzyme activity  <cit>  as focal pathways that mediate responses to alcohol exposure. malic enzyme serves as a metabolic switch to redirect energy metabolism toward fatty acid biosynthesis. results from the drosophila model guided the identification of association between polymorphisms in cytosolic malic enzyme with human alcohol consumption in the framingham heart study offspring cohort  <cit> . the genetic architecture that underlies alcohol sensitivity and induction of tolerance, however, is more complex; it involves transcriptional regulators that alter gene expression  and consists of intricate genetic networks  <cit> . in a previous study we have shown that acute exposure to ethanol results in altered transcript abundance levels of chemoreceptor and detoxification genes, whereas the subsequent development of tolerance is accompanied by changes in transcript abundances of metabolic enzymes  <cit> . however, most studies on the genetic basis of alcohol sensitivity have focused on effects of single genes. a major challenge in understanding the biological effects of alcohol is to identify the interacting networks of segregating loci that contribute to natural variation in alcohol sensitivity.

here, we performed two complementary genome-wide association analyses to explore the genetic basis of natural variation in alcohol sensitivity in drosophila. we performed genome wide association  analyses for alcohol-related phenotypes using the sequenced inbred lines of the drosophila melanogaster genetic reference panel   <cit> , and extreme qtl mapping analyses  <cit>  utilizing an advanced intercross population  derived from sensitive and resistant dgrp lines. we identified  <dig> high confidence candidate genes and placed them in genetic and physical interaction networks. these candidate genes are associated with development and function of the nervous system and include several genes involved in catecholamine synthesis. we confirmed the role of several candidate genes in alcohol sensitivity by functional analyses of mutations and gene expression levels. remarkably,  <dig>  % of the candidate genes have been implicated in previous drosophila, mouse and human studies of alcohol-related phenotypes, suggesting that these candidate genes and genetic networks are associated with evolutionarily conserved processes that underlie natural variation in sensitivity to alcohol.

RESULTS
natural variation for alcohol sensitivity
we took advantage of natural variation in the dgrp to analyze phenotypic variation in responses to acute and repeated exposures to ethanol. we measured alcohol knockdown time  in an “inebriometer”  <cit>  after a single  alcohol exposure , and after a second exposure  following a 2 h recovery period, separately for males and females. we found considerable genetic variation in alcohol sensitivity among the dgrp lines .fig.  <dig> variation in mean elution time  among the  <dig> inbred lines of the drosophila melanogaster genetic reference panel . a variation in response to initial alcohol exposure . b variation in response to a second alcohol exposure . c variation in tolerance. red bars represent females and blue bars males



we expressed individual mets of the  <dig> dgrp lines as deviations from the control mean of the canton s  line for the appropriate date and sex. over the course of the experiments, the canton s  elution time after a single ethanol exposure has a mean of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min for males and females, respectively. the mets after the first exposure ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  min in females and  <dig>  to  <dig>  min in males , with a broad sense heritability of h2 =  <dig> . the averages for dgrp males and females are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min, respectively. the canton s  males and females ranked 69/ and 49/ among the dgrp lines.

the mets after the second exposure were on average higher, reflecting the development of tolerance, and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  min in females and  <dig>  to 21 min in males , with h2 =  <dig>  . genetic variation for alcohol sensitivity is partially context-dependent. although the genetic  and phenotypic  correlations are high between males and females for e <dig> and e <dig>  and between e <dig> and e <dig> for males and females, the significant line × sex and line × exposure interaction terms   reflect genetic variation in the magnitude of sexual dimorphism in e <dig> and e <dig> as well as genetic variation in the magnitude of induction of tolerance in the two sexes. genetic variation in the induction of tolerance can be quantified for each line as the scaled difference in mean elution time between the second and first exposures  <cit> .

induction of tolerance ranged from − <dig>  to 4 min and − <dig>  to 4 min for females and males, respectively. several lines were unable to develop tolerance, and, among the majority that did, the magnitude of tolerance varied continuously .

gwa analyses for alcohol sensitivity in the dgrp
we performed genome-wide single variant association tests for sensitivity to acute and repeated ethanol exposures as well as induction of tolerance for the dgrp lines, using  <dig> , <dig> dna sequence variants with minor allele frequencies greater than  <dig>   <cit> . we performed these analyses for males and females separately within each treatment, as well as using the differences in alcohol sensitivity between the sexes as phenotypic values to identify alleles that modulate sexual dimorphism in alcohol sensitivity. we considered variants with a p-value smaller than 5 × 10− <dig> to be nominally significant .

given the large numbers of tests performed and the relatively small number of dgrp lines, only variants with large effects can achieve significance following a strict bonferroni correction for multiple tests . three closely linked snps in strong linkage disequilibrium  between 3l_ <dig> and 3l_ <dig>  in a gene desert approximately 8 kb upstream of cg <dig> and 5 kb downstream of cg <dig>  affect female sensitivity to an acute alcohol exposure; and one snp at x_ <dig> in the second intron of ct affects male sensitivity to a second exposure at the bonferroni-corrected significance threshold. ct, an early developmental homeobox transcription factor with pleiotropic effects on multiple phenotypes, has been implicated in alcohol sensitivity in drosophila  <cit> , as have its orthologs in mice  <cit>  and humans  <cit> .

the genetic correlations of mets between ethanol exposures and males and females are high. therefore, the different analyses partially serve as independent replicates of alcohol sensitivity, and variants and genes in common among the top ranking associations from the different analyses are likely to be true positives, even though they do not achieve formal statistical significance in their individual analyses. indeed,  <dig> genes were tagged by top variants in one or more treatment/sex combinations . remarkably,  <dig>  of these genes were previously associated with alcohol sensitivity in drosophila, mice and/or humans, and five have been functionally validated previously in drosophila .

extreme qtl mapping
the advantage of the drosophila system is that we can construct a trait-specific, advanced intercross outbred population  from extreme dgrp lines. the sample size of the aip is not limiting, giving increased power to detect variants with smaller effects than in the dgrp. further, the dgrp gwa analyses focused on common variants, because rare alleles are prone to false positives  <cit> , but may give rise to large phenotypic effects  <cit> . in contrast, any variant private to one of the parental lines used to construct the aip will be at intermediate frequency if the number of parental lines is small, thus enabling evaluation of the contribution of alleles with maf <  <dig>  to natural variation in alcohol sensitivity. finally, the aip serves as an independent validation of candidate genes identified in the dgrp.

we constructed an aip for alcohol sensitivity by crossing six dgrp lines with divergent and extreme alcohol sensitivities  to generate a base population in which all lines were equally represented. we maintained this population by random mating at large census size for over  <dig> generations. beginning at generation  <dig>  we scored  <dig>  males and  <dig>  females from the aip for ethanol sensitivity after acute  or repeated  ethanol exposures, and selected the 10 % most sensitive and resistant males and females for each treatment . we performed bulk dna sequencing on dna pooled from these extreme individuals and performed an extreme qtl mapping gwa analysis  <cit>  by comparing differences in allele frequencies between the pools. alleles with divergent frequencies between sensitive and resistant dna pools are either themselves causal alleles or they are in ld with causal alleles affecting the trait.fig.  <dig> extreme qtl mapping analysis. distribution of elution profiles for the advanced intercross population after an acute ethanol exposure  and after two ethanol exposures separated by a 2 h interval . extremes  of the distributions were used for extreme qtl mapping and are shown by the shaded areas. blue bars indicate males, red bars indicate females



consistent with the increased power of extreme qtl mapping in an aip, we found a total of  <dig> variants in or near  <dig> genes associated with alcohol sensitivity in the four extreme qtl gwa analyses  at a bonferroni-corrected significance threshold  with a total of  <dig>  variants passing a nominal threshold of p < 10− <dig>  notably, several of these genes have been implicated previously in drosophila alcohol-related phenotypes, including bun, catsup, cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig>  for, ham, hig, lar, lim <dig>  nudc, pde <dig>  toc and vir- <dig>  . several of these are located in the ddc gene cluster on chromosome 2 l, which harbors closely linked genes involved in catecholamine metabolism.

the ddc gene cluster is of particular interest with regard to alcohol sensitivity in drosophila. dopamine has been implicated in aversive conditioning towards repellent odorants  <cit> . however, dopaminergic neurotransmission appears to be essential for development of conditioned preference for ethanol-associated cues  <cit> . both octopamine and dopamine have been implicated in appetitive reward signaling in response to a sugar stimulus  <cit> . octopamine-mediated reinforcement depends on interactions with dopaminergic neurons in the mushroom bodies  <cit> . dopaminergic neurons in the protocerebral anterior medial cluster that project to the medial lobes of the mushroom bodies  <cit>  have been implicated in appetitive reinforcement. thus, this dopamine-mediated positive reinforcement circuit may represent an insect analog of the vertebrate mesolimbic dopamine reward system that originates in the nucleus accumbens.

comparison of dgrp and extreme qtl gwa analyses
applying the same logic to the extreme qtl gwa analysis as for the dgrp gwa analyses, the top candidate genes that do not meet the bonferroni significance threshold will occur in more than one analysis. we found  <dig> genes tagged by top variants in one or more treatment/sex combinations in the extreme qtl gwa analysis , of which  <dig>  were previously associated with alcohol sensitivity in drosophila, mice and/or humans, and four have been functionally validated previously in drosophila .

no polymorphisms were in common between the top associations in the dgrp gwa analyses and the extreme qtl gwa analyses. this is not unexpected, since many of the polymorphisms associated with alcohol sensitivity phenotypes in the dgrp are not present in the six founding parents of the aip, and low frequency variants that could not be tested in the dgrp that are present in the founding parents have a frequency of at least  <dig>  in the aip, and can be tested. in addition, we induced ld by crossing the six parental lines in the first generation of the aip, and thus the local ld structure differs between the dgrp and aip. however, even if no polymorphisms are in common, under an additive model we do expect overlap among the top genes detected in the two gwa analyses. indeed, we found  <dig> genes in common between the dgrp and extreme qtl analyses, of which  <dig> were previously associated with alcohol sensitivity in drosophila, mice and/or humans, and four have been functionally validated previously in drosophila .table  <dig> common candidate genes for dgrp and extreme qtl gwa analyses previously associated with alcohol-related phenotypes in humans

interaction networks for alcohol sensitivity
in total, we identified  <dig> candidate genes for ethanol sensitivity as those genes with at least one variant significant at a bonferroni-corrected p-value, as well as genes among the top associations that occurred in more than one of the dgrp, extreme qtl, or both the dgrp and extreme qtl gwa analyses . the top candidate genes are highly pleiotropic and for many, genetic and physical interaction partners are known  <cit>  . we used this information to place the candidate genes in context. a total of  <dig> candidate genes participate in a genetic interaction network of  <dig> genes  . this network includes elements of signaling pathways associated with early development, including canonical notch, wingless, epidermal growth factor, and hedgehog signaling pathways. genes involved in cyclic nucleotide signaling, which has been previously associated with alcohol sensitivity , are also present in this network. many of the candidate genes interact with each other and may be control points that participate in a large number of additional interactions. for example, ct, which was tagged by a snp that achieved bonferroni-level significance in the dgrp gwa analysis, interacts with lola, which was implicated in the extreme qtl mapping gwa analysis. ct and lola both encode transcription factors; ct has been implicated as a target for notch signaling in wing development, and lola is a major regulator of axon guidance. similarly, a total of  <dig> candidate genes participate in a physical interaction network of  <dig> genes  .fig.  <dig> genetic interaction network for variation in alcohol sensitivity. the network was constructed from candidate genes , identified from the combined dgrp and extreme qtl gwa analyses, while allowing for one missing gene . the network consists of  <dig> interconnected candidate genes



functional validation of candidate genes
we used mutational analysis to establish causal links between genes implicated in our dgrp and extreme qtl gwa analyses and effects on alcohol sensitivity. based on availability of co-isogenic mi{et1} and p-element insertional mutations, we tested mutations in aret, beat-ic, bun, calx, cg <dig>  if, cyp49a1/galphao, lim <dig>  mgl, otk, pde1c, pk/cg <dig>  rdga and trio. in addition, we tested uas-rnai lines under an ubi-gal <dig> driver targeting kcnq and fng. we found that aret, beat-ic, cg <dig>  cyp49a1/galphao, kcnq and pk/cg <dig> showed increased resistance after acute and/or repeated ethanol exposures; pde1c, if, otk and rdga were more sensitive to ethanol exposures; bun, calx, fng, lim <dig>  mgl and trio demonstrated either increased or decreased resistance to ethanol depending on the sex or number of ethanol exposures . in summary, all  <dig> candidate genes and the three missing genes implicated by the network analysis  had significant effects on ethanol sensitivity in at least one sex/exposure combination, indicating that our top candidate genes are enriched for true positive associations. orthologs of eight of these functionally validated genes  have previously been associated with alcohol phenotypes in mouse and human studies , suggesting that inferences made from drosophila are more broadly relevant across taxa.fig.  <dig> functional confirmations of candidate genes. a candidate genes from the dgrp, extreme qtl gwa analyses and the genetic network analysis were functionally tested using transposon insertion mutations and rnai knockdown lines. all  <dig> candidate genes showed significant differences from the control for at least one of the genetic terms . g – genotype: mutant or control; s – sex: male, female; e − exposure: e <dig>  e2; * - genes present in genetic network from fig. 3; # – missing gene from the genetic network. m_e <dig>  m_e <dig>  f_e <dig> and f_e <dig> – phenotypic effects in males  and females , respectively after an acute  or repeated  ethanol exposures. b effects of  <dig> mutants of candidate genes on sensitivity to acute  and repeated  ethanol exposure in males  and females  compared to control. squares indicate candidate genes found only in gwa analyses; circles indicate candidate genes found only from extreme qtl mapping analyses; triangles indicate missing genes from the genetic network in fig.  <dig>  candidate genes found in more than one analyses  are shown with diamond shapes. data are presented as the deviation of the met of each line and sex from the appropriate control line ± sem, calculated as sem2+sec <dig>  where m and c are se for mutant and control lines, respectively. the color bar indicates the significance levels for both fig. 4a and b




the extreme qtl gwa analysis identified a cluster of  <dig> genes located on chromosome 2 l between two intergenic regions  spanning from mib <dig> to drl and associated with variation in acute alcohol sensitivity , including catsup and ddc, which regulate the biosynthesis of dopamine, a neurotransmitter critically associated with alcohol addiction in human studies  <cit>  and implicated in associative conditioning in drosophila  <cit> . we focused only on candidate genes that have snps in introns, coding or 3’ and 5’ utr regions. we analyzed expression levels of ten candidate genes 37ce, ddc, drl, mib <dig> and lim3) in pools of the three extreme sensitive and three extreme resistant dgrp lines that were used to generate the advanced intercross population by quantitative rt-pcr for both sexes, separately. we found that  <dig> of  <dig>  transcripts tested indeed showed altered transcript levels between the sensitive and resistant pools for both sexes . it is of interest to note that increased expression of the genes indicated in fig.  <dig>  is associated with increased resistance. to assess whether this is significantly different from random expectation, we also measured transcript abundance levels of nine randomly selected genes that are also located on chromosome 2 l and have not been associated with alcohol sensitivity previously. here, only  <dig> of  <dig>  transcripts showed altered transcripts level between the extreme pools . the proportion of candidate genes with altered expression level is significantly greater than for randomly selected genes . thus, differences in expression levels of these candidate genes could be a causal explanation for their association with variation in acute alcohol sensitivity.fig.  <dig> expression levels of mrnas of a group of genes located on chromosome 2 l pooled across parental lines  used to establish the advanced intercross population. panels  and  show mrna expression levels of candidate genes from extreme qtl mapping analyses in males and females, respectively. panels  and  show mrna expression levels of randomly selected genes in males and females, respectively. green bars indicate the pool of sensitive lines, orange bars indicate the pool of resistant lines. *: p <  <dig> ; **: p <  <dig> ; ***: p <  <dig> ; student’s t-test



in summary, our functional analyses suggest that networks of early neurodevelopmental genes as well as variation in catecholamine neurotransmitter levels determine natural variation in alcohol sensitivity in adult flies in this wild derived population.

discussion
alcohol-related phenotypes are diverse and span the spectrum from acute intoxication to long-term physiological addiction. similarly, the physiological effects of alcohol are diverse, encompassing both intermediary metabolic pathways as well as the nervous system, where alcohol can exert both general sedative effects and elicit addiction through its actions on the dopaminergic reward system. the complexity of the physiological responses to alcohol exposure a priori predict that multiple interacting genetic factors would predispose to alcohol sensitivity; thus, a comprehensive understanding of the genetic underpinnings of alcohol sensitivity must reach beyond studies of individual genes, but take into account a genetic context in which environmentally sensitive ensembles of genes determine the phenotypic outcome.

studies on alcohol drinking behavior, intoxication, and addiction in human populations or in mouse models have focused primarily on qtl mapping , candidate gene associations , transcriptional profiling  and, most recently, on genome-wide associations . previous studies on the genetics of alcohol sensitivity in drosophila employed mutagenesis screens  <cit> , transcriptional profiling of flies before and after alcohol exposure  <cit>  or of lines artificially selected for high and low alcohol sensitivity  <cit> , as well as characterization of selected candidate genes . here, we have used the dgrp and a dgrp-derived aip to perform the first gwa analyses to identify genes harboring variants that determine natural variation in individual alcohol sensitivity and variation in induction of tolerance in the drosophila model.

combining the results from both gwa analyses identified candidate genes associated with natural variation in alcohol sensitivity with a high degree of confidence. causal relationships of a large fraction of these genes with phenotypic variation is apparent from the high degree with which mutations in those candidate genes recapitulate effects on alcohol related phenotypes and from previous studies which have implicated the same genes in alcohol related phenotypes both in drosophila and vertebrates, including mice and humans . most of the genes involved in cell adhesion, neural development, cyclic nucleotide and inositol triphosphate metabolism and signaling emerged as candidate genes from prior studies as well. human orthologs of for, kcnq, pde1c, phl, pkc53e, rhea  <cit> , fra  <cit> , nrx-iv  <cit> , pde <dig>  <cit> , pka-r <dig>  <cit>  and rhogap68f  <cit>  have been associated with alcohol dependence and/or alcohol consumption in human gwa studies.

we were able to connect candidate genes associated with variation in alcohol sensitivity in a genetic interaction network that encompasses early neurodevelopmental signaling pathways, including notch, wnt, egfr, and hedgehog pathways . it is of interest to note that ct, which is a target of the notch pathway  <cit>  and implicated in axonogenesis  <cit> , shows an association that surpasses the stringent bonferroni-corrected multiple testing threshold in the gwa analysis of the dgrp. thus, subtle differences in neuronal connectivity determined in early development of the nervous system or possibly reflecting variation in neuroplasticity in the adult brain appear to be a major determinant of individual variation in susceptibility to alcohol exposure. together with the genetic network that regulates neurodevelopment, our analyses implicate genes associated with neurotransmitter signaling, including dopamine and the cyclic amp signaling pathway as factors that affect individual variation in alcohol sensitivity.

three important insights emerge from our analyses. first, the majority of previous studies have identified widespread changes in genome wide transcript expression on exposure to alcohol . however, due to the highly correlated nature of transcriptional co-regulation networks, it is not possible to infer which changes are causal and which are co-regulated responses to causal changes. comparison of our results with these studies  indicates that the genes we identify as top candidates based on genetic polymorphisms in the gwa analyses largely overlap with genes whose expression is up- or down-regulated in response to alcohol, suggesting that these genes may be causal, affecting both transcriptional responses and whole organism behavioral responses to alcohol exposure. this hypothesis is amenable to direct experimental testing in the future. second, the neurodevelopmental genes associated with variation in alcohol sensitivity in the drosophila system are evolutionarily highly conserved and, thus, it is reasonable to postulate that similar orthologous networks may be associated with variation in alcohol sensitivity across phyla, including in human populations. further, it is reasonable to surmise that alcohol-induced perturbation of early developmental networks may represent a likely target for the induction of fetal alcohol syndrome in people. third, principles of pleiotropy and context dependence  are generally applicable elements that are likely characteristics of network organization across phyla.

finally, we should note that we did not detect several genes implicated by artificial selection and mutagenesis screens for alcohol related phenotypes in drosophila . there could be several reasons why variants in these genes are not detected in our genome-wide association study. first, functional polymorphisms in these genes may have low frequencies in the population and thus are not captured by our gwa analysis which tests only variants with maf >  <dig> . second, the effects of the common variants in these genes may be small and our gwa is not sufficiently powered to detect them at the threshold used. third, the effects of variants in these genes may be buffered by other genes in the complex physiological process of ethanol detoxification. to summarize, we can only uncover genes associated with natural variation in alcohol sensitivity that harbor polymorphisms with allele frequencies and effect sizes large enough to resolve in our analyses. thus, genes in which mutations clearly have large effects on a trait may not be functionally variable in natural populations if they are under strong selective constraint, or they may harbor rare alleles that cannot be individually assessed by gwa analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
gwa association analyses for ethanol sensitivity/resistance and toerance in the inbred, sequecned dgrp lines and an aip derived from extremely sensitive and resistant lines identified mutliple genes affecting alcohol-related behaviors. these genes participate in known genetic and physical interaction networks; are in evolutionrily conserved signalling pathways, including catecholamine neurotransmitter biosynthesis and early development of the nervous system; and have been implicated in alcohol-related phenotypes in mice and humans.
