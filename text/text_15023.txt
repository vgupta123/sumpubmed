BACKGROUND
tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are a family of antimicrobial agents that are frequently used in veterinary medicine because of their broad-spectrum of activity and their relatively low cost  <cit> . besides the therapeutic use of tetracyclines, they have also been administered as growth promoters in many countries  <cit> . the extensive use of tetracyclines have resulted in an emergence of resistant bacteria  <cit> . thus, commensal and pathogenic escherichia coli isolated from pigs are often resistant to tetracycline  <cit> .

tetracycline resistance usually results from the acquisition of genes that are involved mainly in three processes: antibiotic efflux through energy-dependent membrane-associated proteins, ribosomal protection, and enzymatic inactivation of tetracycline  <cit> . more than  <dig> different classes of tetracycline resistance genes have been identified  <cit> . in commensal and pathogenic e. coli, the genes involved mainly in the acquisition of tetracycline resistance are genes encoding efflux proteins, being tet and tet most frequently detected  <cit> . the ribosomal protection gene tet was first reported in e. coli in  <dig>  when bryan et al. detected a tet gene in strains from chicken and pigs that shared a 98% identity over 386 bp to a tet gene found in enterococcus faecalis <cit> . since then, this gene has also been identified in an e. coli from a river basin  <cit>  and in a small number of avian, porcine, and human e. coli isolates  <cit> .

tet has been identified in more than  <dig> genera of bacteria and it has become the widest host range of any tetracycline resistance gene  <cit> . this may be due, at least partially, to its association with conjugative transposons  <cit> . in enterococci, tet is the most common tetracycline resistance determinant and it is mainly associated with the conjugative transposon tn <dig> <cit> , although it has also been found in another conjugative transposons  and on plasmids  <cit> . to our knowledge, in e. coli, there are no previous reports studying the linkage of the tet gene to different mobile genetic elements.

enterococci and e. coli are natural inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. in previous studies, the in vivo transfer of resistance genes among intestinal tract bacteria has been showed. thus, the transfer of resistance genes from e. faecalis to e. coli and between e. coli isolates in the gut has been demonstrated  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the finding of the tet gene in e. coli strains it is due to a horizontal transfer of this gene from enterococci.

the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of tet, tet, and tet genes in doxycycline-resistant e. coli isolates from pigs, as well as the detection of mobile genetic elements linked to tet in e. coli and its possible transfer from enterococci.

RESULTS
detection of tetracycline resistance genes
all of the analyzed e. coli isolates contained at least one of the three tetracycline resistance genes studied. the most frequently detected gene, tet, was found alone or combined with other genes in  <dig> of the  <dig>  tetracycline-resistant isolates. tet and tet were detected in  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the e. coli isolates, respectively .

detection of tn916-, tn5397-, and tn5801-like conjugative transposons
none of the  <dig> tet-positive e. coli isolates carried the xis-tn gene from tn <dig>  the tndx gene from tn <dig>  or the int gene from tn <dig>  of the  <dig> tet-positive enterococci isolates  selected from the pigs from which the tet-positive e. coli were isolated, seven  contained the xis-tn gene, two  carried the tndx gene, and one  carried both the tndx and int genes. twenty-six isolates  were negative for the xis-tn, tndx, and int genes.

southern blot
hybridization to the tet probe was obtained in the plasmid dna from the four e. coli isolates tested  and from three  of the four enterococci isolates analyzed. the approximate size of the plasmids from the e. coli and enterococci isolates is around  <dig> kb.

sequencing of the tet gene and phylogenetic analysis
the upstream part of the tet gene was amplified in all the e. coli and enterococci isolates analyzed in the study. however, the downstream part of the gene was only amplified in  <dig> out of the  <dig> enterococci isolates and it was not amplified in any e. coli isolate.

comparison of the  <dig> tet sequences selected from this study  revealed five different sequence types and the pylogenetic analysis divided these into four phylogenetic groups . the phylogenetic tree  showed the plasmid-borne tet  of the four e. coli isolates  represent a new tet allele. four enterococci isolates negative for the xis-tn, tndx, and int genes  and one isolate positive for tndx from tn <dig>  contained identical tet genes  . the tet gene from enterococci isolates containing xis-tn from tn <dig> or int from tn <dig>  grouped with the tet genes of the respective transposons .

conjugative transfer of tet in filter mating experiments
conjugal transfer of tet gene between donor  and recipient  enterococci was observed, except from e. hirae to e. faecium bm <dig>  and from e. faecalis cicyt- <dig> to e. faecalis jh2- <dig> . tet was successfully transferred from all the four donor enterococci strains to the recipient e. coli cicyt70-ri. no transfer of tet gene was detected from e. coli to e. faecium or e. faecalis.

discussion
in the present study, tet was the tetracycline resistance gene detected most frequently, which is in agreement with a previous study carried out on e. coli isolated from healthy pigs  <cit> . on the contrary, in other studies tet was detected more frequently than tet in e. coli isolated from healthy pigs  <cit> . a negative association between the presence of tet and tet in e. coli has been described in previous studies  <cit> . it has been suggested that this negative association is probably caused by plasmid incompatibilities  <cit> . however, in the present study,  <dig> of the  <dig>  e. coli isolates tested carried both tet and tet .

the tet gene is one of the most frequently detected tetracycline resistance determinant in enterococcal strains  <cit> . however, tet is uncommon in gram-negative coliforms such as e. coli <cit> . in the present study, tet was detected in  <dig> of the  <dig>  tetracycline-resistant e. coli isolates tested. this may indicate a possible transfer of this gene from other intestinal tract bacteria, most likely from enterococci, to e. coli.

in enterococci tet is often associated with conjugative transposons tn <dig>  tn <dig>  and tn <dig> <cit> . therefore, the presence of these transposons was determined in the  <dig> tet-positive e. coli isolates and in  <dig> enterococci isolates selected from the pigs from which the tet-positive e. coli were isolated. none of the e. coli isolates and only  <dig> of the enterococci carried some of these transposons. in contrast, agersø et al. <cit>  detected tn916-like in a high percentage  of e. faecium isolated from pigs, although this percentage of detection was lower  in e. faecalis strains from the same source. however, these authors  <cit>  did not detect tn5397-like among enterococci isolated from pigs, while in this work it was detected in  <dig> of the  <dig>  isolates tested.

the absence of transposons in e. coli and in most of the enterococci isolates in the present study suggests that the tet gene of these isolates is carried on a plasmid. southern blot was performed in order to show the possible plasmid location of tet and a positive hybridization with a tet probe was obtained in the plasmid dna from all the e. coli isolates and three of the four enterococci isolates tested.

the phylogenetic analysis shown in figure  <dig> revealed a new tet allele presents in the e. coli isolates which grouped separately and were only distantly related to the enterococcal tet sequences detected in this study. thus the origin of the plasmid-born tet from the e. coli isolates is unknown, though is probably transferred from other bacteria in the intestinal tract. the tet gene carried on a plasmid in e. faecalis isolates of this study was identical to tet plasmid-borne from e. faecium  and e. faecium  isolated from pigs and broilers, respectively. in e. faecium cicyt- <dig> a tn5801-like tet gene identical to the sequence described in tn <dig> from staphylococcus aureus of human origin  was identified. to our knowledge, this is the first report of tn5801-like tet detection in e. faecium and this suggests the horizontal transfer of tn <dig> between different gram-positive bacteria.

the mobility of tet was investigated in filter mating experiments. the results confirmed that tet in our enterococci isolates was linked to a mobile genetic element that could be transferred in vitro between enterococci, from enterococci to e. coli, but not from e. coli to enterococci. thus, tetracycline-resistant transconjugants were obtained in all the mating experiments using e. faecalis as a donor and e. faecium bm <dig> as a recipient. when e. faecalis jh2- <dig> was used as a recipient, the transfer of tet was detected from only three of the four donor strains. despite this result, the transfer rates for tet between e. faecalis obtained in the present study were higher than those reported previously  <cit> . tet was also transferred from e. hirae to the recipient strain e. faecalis jh2- <dig>  but not to e. faecium bm <dig>  to the best of our knowledge, horizontal transfer of tet from e. hirae to e. faecalis has not been reported previously.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the detection of tet in e. coli isolates from healthy pigs was higher than expected. our results suggest that the presence of tet in the e. coli isolates may be the result of the transfer of this tetracycline resistance gene from another bacteria in the intestinal tract. however, in the present study, tet detected in e. coli isolates was shown to be a new allele type carried on a plasmid of unknown origin. nevertheless, it can not be ruled out that this plasmid was transferred from other bacteria in the intestinal tract, since it is known that a gene flow between bacteria belonging to different genera occurs.
