BACKGROUND
biological sequences are the ultimate support for the description of biological systems. in particular, key aspects of sequence analysis are known to play a role in integrated analysis of regulatory networks: for example in motif searching and inference.

over the last decades and more recently due to the development of a considerable number of whole genome sequencing projects, several efforts have been made to mathematically model dna sequences. in particular from the statistical side, the use of markov based models  <cit>  has widespread and proven to be effective in tackling the problem of data mining of biological sequences, through variable length markov chains  <cit> , interpolated markov models  <cit> , fractal prediction machines  <cit>  for symbolic time series based on chaos game representations  <cit> , to name just a few. other algorithmic approaches based on the computational side have also proven to be useful  <cit> . all this effort allowed establishing important relations between the results obtained  with real biologically significant findings. from these models developed for dna, it is now apparent that each genome has pervasive  <cit>  motif and compositional characteristics in terms of the frequencies of its constitutive l-tuples or l-length motifs, which gave rise to the genomic signature concept  <cit> . this fact can be directly employed for horizontal transfer detection and characterization, coding vs. non-coding discrimination  <cit> , study and compare dna through the use of composition profiles  <cit>  and spectra  <cit>  and other applications partly reviewed in  <cit> .

in this regard and more specifically, an important statistical problem in bioinformatics that emerged is the evaluation of the number of repetitions occurring in biological sequences. more generally, they can occur in distinct hierarchical levels, from single symbols  <cit>  to genes. in fact, in a recent paper, the number of gene repetitions was shown to be a key aspect of gene expression and phenotype  <cit> . apparently theses repetitions, not only at nucleotide level, might play a key role in genome organization and functionality of networks. the notions of repetitions, entropy and correlation in dna are unquestionably connected  <cit>  and references therein – the degree of predictability of a sequence, which is closely related with its internal repetition and compression, can be measured by its entropy. the major importance of this research has provided evidence that is already too vast to fully account for. in particular, the relation between motif over- or under-representation is usually related with their biological function. this creates the need for an efficient method to analyze, for different parameters sets, the degree or scale of each dna region.

in a recent report  <cit> , the authors defined a new continuous measure of dna entropy, based on non-parametric density estimation applied to chaos game representation  and universal sequence maps  within the rényi theory. the idea therein explored was that there is a close relationship between the statistics of the sequences, given by their constitutive motifs, and their entropy, measured under information theory methodologies. in that report the rényi entropy was estimated in a global approach, and the measures obtained were compared with random sequences by monte carlo simulation. although the main concepts were then introduced, that report was incomplete in the sense that just a global analysis was conducted. specifically, no exploration of local patterns and fine tuned neighboring analysis was conducted, which is finally allowed by the present work, with the introduction of the concept of the entropic profile .

entropic profiles were defined previously but in a different context and scope: they were estimated using the histograms of the l-mer or l-tuple frequencies in dna  <cit> . in that report the authors could discriminate between random and natural dna sequences using the shannon entropies of the histograms obtained from the cgr for different resolutions or oligomer lengths. although the same name was used, that previous endeavor focused on a global perspective of sequence entropy  <cit>  whereas this report proposes and investigates a local entropy formulation instead. in fact, the results obtained by oliver and colleagues are global features for each dna sequence, different from the present proposal of local based information per position/symbol. another type of sequence profile also explored was based on linguistic complexity  <cit>  and low entropy dna zones  <cit> .

in the present report the definition of entropic profile arises from the direct estimation of a local density, derived from the parzen's window method described before. in our last report this estimation allowed the calculation of a global entropy measure, according to the rényi definition. this report describes the next logical step of exploring complementary methods to access local information as to identify the location and composition of the conserved sequence which existence might have been anticipated from the global measures of entropy. the rationale is to have a function that assesses, for each position in the sequence , the information content of l-tuple suffixes directly from the density kernel function estimate. such a solution should enable the scale-independent extraction of motifs without the need to identify complex state automata for unit succession.

in addition to our preceding report on rényi entropy for global characterization of sequences, the study reported here also builds on the identification of a kernel function that produces a more accurate density estimation in cgr/usm projections of symbolic sequences  <cit> . the more conventional use of symmetrical functions as we did with a gaussian parzen kernel produces a rough fit to the characteristically fractal nature of iterative map projections. that approximation did suffice for assessment of global entropy  <cit>  but it is not refined enough for the intended density estimation resolved locally at the sequence unit level.

future applications of the methodologies here proposed might include motif inference and extraction, providing tools for the construction and inference of generalized sequence models for whole genomes.

RESULTS
this section presents some entropic profiles calculated for the dna sequences described below. the relation between this values and former results is also investigated. additionally, the influence of the parameters on the profiles is discussed.

dna sequence dataset description
for sake of clarity this report uses the same dataset previously studied  <cit> , thus allowing a comparison of results, in the continuity of the former proposal. in particular, the results for a subset of those sequences with known present motifs will be shown and extensively studied. in order to further test the estimation of the profiles to more challenging datasets, the analysis of whole genomes is also included. more specifically, the detection of chi sequences in escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae will be assessed. these genomes have been extensively analyzed after the completion of its dna sequencing projects, thus constituting an excellent dataset to test new procedures. in particular, several important motifs have been studied elsewhere and can be compared directly with the proposed method. the following table  <dig> recalls the dna sequences examined.

the artificial sequences m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> are obtained by generating random dna  and subsequently implanting the motifs described  in specific positions. the sequence es corresponds to the concatenation of real dna from  <dig> promoter regions of bacillus subtilis  <cit> , with known consensus structured motif ttgaca--tataat with at most one point mutation or substitution. the sequences ec and hi are the complete genomes of escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae extracted from ncbi genbank.

all the datasets and additional information are available in the webpage referred to above.

entropic profiles and parameters optimization
the tests consisted on calculating the entropic profiles  for different combination of parameters l and φ and check for particular features. the use of artificial dna allows the accurate study of the impact of the parameters on the profiles obtained. the results can be directly obtained by using the deduced formulae of equations  <dig> for f^l, φ  and their corresponding normalized values g^l, φ  , after specifying the parameters .

the results presented in this section are focused on the analysis of specific positions, known to be important and/or contain statistical significant motifs as suffixes. for example, figure  <dig> represents the profiles obtained for the sequence m <dig> with the motif 'atcg' implanted. this motif was implanted n =  <dig> times at equally spaced positions p = 50+i <dig>  i =  <dig>  ...,  <dig> . by studying one of the positions where this suffix ends , one immediately assesses for which combination of parameters l and φ the maximum values of the profiles is obtained. in this case this maximum is achieved with l =  <dig> and φ approximately of  <dig> .

as seen from the figure 1a) and 1b), there are parameter combinations for which that particular position/suffix is highlighted, with normalized density values way above alternative choices. it was not by chance that the maximum was attained at l =  <dig>  since this is precisely the length of the suffix highly repeated, so lmax ≥  <dig> was expected to be a local maximum of ep.

in the other panels of figure  <dig> the entropic profile for the complete sequence is plotted, using the parameters previously optimized for the chosen position . these plots allow the overview of all the sequence using local information obtained for a specific putative important suffix and, in fact, using this combination of parameters one immediately recovers all the positions where the known motif appears, which are simply the peaks on the graph. panel d) shows a detail of the ep , clearly illustrating the position where the implanted motif "atcg" ends, with a density local maximum around ep =  <dig> . the expected number of counts under a first-order markov chain model would be  <dig>  .

in figure 1e) and 1f) is also shown the corresponding density estimations on the cgr map for two distinct parameter sets. comparatively with the gaussian function this kernel is better adjusted to the cgr square-based geometry and presents a more clear-cut profile, as expected. the darker squares correspond precisely to the implanted motif sub-quadrants.

the following figures present the same results obtained with the other datasets under study.

in figure  <dig> the same pattern occurs, with maxima ep =  <dig> , obtained for l =  <dig>  again the implanted motif length. it should be mentioned that occasionally, for some positions where the motif "atc" appears, the maxima occurs for a value l >  <dig>  this can also happen and simply means that longer, non-implanted motifs appeared more often that would be expected by chance – in this case "atc" is embedded in a longer significant motif, i.e. is contained in a longer string with potential significance. interestingly, when plotting all the ep for the sequence using l =  <dig>  one obtains additional, non-implanted motifs, which occurred just by chance – extra peaks with non-equal spacing in figure 2c) and 2d). in fact, the probability of one specific motif of length  <dig>  is 4- <dig>  which implies, for a sequence of  <dig>  that the expected number of counts is roughly equal to  <dig>  this simply means that the motif already existed in the random sequence m <dig> before the implantation took place. the detail graph – fig. 2d) – shows precisely these "extra" appearances. if one uses a first-order markov chain model as previously the expected number of counts becomes  <dig>  .

a similar interpretation can be made regarding sequence m5: the positions where the suffix "atcga" appears have maximal values g^  for l =  <dig>  although with high values in the range l =  <dig> to l =  <dig>  which indicate nested significant motifs. the entropic profile for the complete  <dig> base-sequence shows the maxima of the equally spaced motif , where it is noticeable an extra peak that corresponds to a previously existing motif atcga .

by spanning the parameters space  it is possible to find maximum values for g^ . for example, in specific positions  <dig> one finds out that g^ attains a maximum value for memory l =  <dig> and φ ≥  <dig> with ep =  <dig> , a high relative value. by using these optima in the ep one obtains a profile that highlights immediately the suffixes where the highly repeated motif appears. some other maxima appears sometimes , but were discovered to correspond to other interpretable extreme values. the expected number of counts for this motif is just  <dig>  that, comparing with the observed  <dig> occurrences, gives a p-value≈ <dig> .

finally, figure  <dig> shows part of the results for the real dna sequence in the position corresponding to the ending of the tata box . the graph for this position shows precisely that l =  <dig> is an interesting scale to search for. the ep, in contrast to the former ones, does not exhibit a clear trend. in fact, differently to the former sequences, which were artificially generated and presented non-degenerate highly conserved motifs, the real dna exhibits several point mutations that introduce some "noise" in the estimations. when plotting the complete profile for this sequence and observing one detail it is possible to recover the complete structured motif, known to bind to specific transcription factor binding sites, with values ep =  <dig>  and ep =  <dig> . it should be stressed however, that these results are biased towards the sequence itself: in this particular case, the concatenation of the promoter regions of b. subtilis provided a set with conserved motifs, at least to the point where they could be detected by density estimations. of course, if non-conservation is allowed up to a higher level, the ep becomes noisier and eventually the signal will be lost, hampering the recovering of any significant motif if no pre-processing correction is performed. the analysis based of markov chains gives for the tataat motif an expected number of counts of  <dig>   and  <dig>  for ttgaca . the most common motif ep =  <dig>  is highly periodic which explains the peak, although under a markov chain it is expected to occur  <dig>  .

the two last datasets are constituted by whole genomes from two gammaproteobacteria: escherichia coli k <dig> and haemophilus influenzae rd .

the study of the regions where chi sequences appear will be analyzed in both genomes. chi  sites are homologous recombinational hotspot octamer sequences which modulate the exonuclease activity of recbcd. this enzyme is necessary for chromosomal dsdna repair and integration of exogenous dsdna, which supports the idea that chi sites have a biologically functional role  <cit> .

since chi motifs are orientation-dependent and strand-specific, the sequence to be analyzed should be previously processed to comply with this property. this means that one should extract the whole genome and use the dna sequence from the origin of replication up to the terminus plus the reverse complementary sequence, since chromosome replication in bacteria start from one replication origin  and proceeds bi-directionally until the replication forks reach the termination site . these pre-processed genomes will conform the 5'->3' direction of replication and therefore will be used throughout the analysis. the oric and terc positions  have been estimated based on experimental data and asymmetric properties  <cit>  and are specified in table  <dig> 

the number of occurrences of chi motifs in the genomes shows that they are overrepresented in e. coli  but not in h. influenzae .

chi sequences  are statistically overrepresented in the genome of e. coli , appearing more often than would be expected by chance whereas in h. influenzae  they are known to be less frequent and less conserved. this makes for two different datasets with distinct features that involve a different degree of difficulty to detect these regions.

the study of chi sites have been subject to many analyses and therefore constitute an excellent test dataset to assess the strength of the entropic profile approach to detect these motifs. in particular several recent papers have assessed its statistical significance using markov models  <cit> , analyzing the 8-tuple frequency for the whole genome of e. coli  <cit>  and also comparing chi site conservation in both organisms  <cit> .

the expected number of an 8-tuple in e. coli and h. influenzae using a markov model of order  <dig>  is respectively  <dig>  and  <dig> . one immediately sees that in e. coli this motif is highly represented whereas in h. influenzae this fact is less evident.

interestingly, when analyzing whole genomes, several motifs appear with p-values near  <dig>  i.e. they occur in exceptionally high number when considering a markov chain model. this fact does not allow their accurate comparison and is a major drawback of using solely the p-values to assess the statistical significance and correctly compare and order the relative importance of these motifs. therefore, as explained in the methods, the normalized z-scores are also reported for clarity.

for example, using a first order markov chain model the expected number of counts for the chi-sequence in e. coli and h. influenza is  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. although this motif has a p-value≈ <dig> for both sequences, the corresponding z-score of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively puts it in different ranks among all motifs of the same length.

when analyzing one  position where chi sequence ends in e. coli  the following profiles are obtained . the position p =  <dig> shows that the maximum ep values are obtained for parameters  and , for which the profiles attain similar values of ep =  <dig>  and ep =  <dig>  respectively. for l =  <dig> the motif also appears relevant. the complete profiles for that region are plotted in the panels c) and d), showing striking and evident peaks at the positions where chi sequences end. the other local maximum corresponds to a chi-related sequence , which in fact shares the 5-mer gctgg. indeed, the family containing the trimer ctg, often within the pentamer gctgg, is very frequent in this genome  <cit> , all with p-values≈ <dig> and highest scoring ranks

when analyzing the genome of h. influenzae and studying one particular position where motif 5'-ggtggtgg-3' ends , the following figure  <dig> is obtained.

from figure 6a) is it possible to see that the maximum ep =  <dig>  is obtained for parameters , a relatively low value when compared with the previous examples so far. interestingly other peaks exhibit a period of  <dig>  – the motif tggtgg repeats every  <dig> and  <dig> bases and therefore that property is patent in the graph  through the appearance of this local maxima every  <dig> bases. when using the above parameters to plot the entire profile one immediately sees that other positions of extremely high significance appear. this is the case of the 8-tuple motifs aagtgcgg and agtgcggt, which corresponds to ep =  <dig> , p-value≈ <dig>  z-score =  <dig> , and ep =  <dig> , p-value≈ <dig>  z-score =  <dig> , marked in figure 6d). these motifs appear  <dig> and  <dig> times in the genome, which makes them the most common 8-tuples, along with ccgcactt , accgcact  and aaagtgcg , using the same parameters.

as expected, the chi sites are not detected solely based on ep maximization. in fact, the motif is not especially over-represented when compared with all the others, so it would be impossible to detect based solely on the raw entropic profiles. furthermore and evident from the figures, the h. influenzae genome has one extremely ubiquitous 9-tuple motif, the extensively studied uptake signal sequence  aagtgcggt  and its inverted complement sequence  accgcactt  with a total number of  <dig> occurrences. their p-values≈ <dig> and their extremely high z-scores of  <dig>  and  <dig> , puts them in the first rank positions of exceptionality. furthermore, all the motifs present among the first  <dig> highest scoring positions greatly overlap uss sequences  <cit> .

usss are involved in natural competence, which is a genetically controlled form of horizontal gene transfer in some bacterial species, related to their ability to take up dna from the surrounding environment . this process allows genetic exchange in bacteria, which is the only organism known to actively take up dna from the environment and recombine it into their own genome  <cit> . the dna uptake machinery on the cell surface preferentially binds and takes up fragments containing this specific short sequence. in particular h. influenzae is able to take up double-stranded dna of its own species and closely relatives, facilitated through the recognition of uss, which are indeed over represented in its genome.

one interesting statistical aspect of the uss distribution, besides its extremely over-representation, is that these sequences appear equally partitioned in both strands and are remarkably and significantly evenly spaced around the chromosome  <cit> . they can be constituted by the  <dig> bp core referred to but allowing a longer  <dig> bp consensus. the uss evolutionary origin and function was recently addressed  <cit>  by confronting two models, preference first hypothesis and a molecular drive hypothesis. nevertheless this issue remains controversial  <cit> .

through the analysis of h. influenzae complete genome conducted above one obtains peaks on the entropic profiles precisely at these ubiquitous motifs, which definitely obscures the retrieval of chi sequences, whose number of occurrences is not at all comparable with uss frequency.

in fact, the profile obtained for the maximum values  shows that the chi sequence  attains a maximum entropic density value of  <dig> , which is way below the detection level when compared with the value obtained for uss which was equal to ep =  <dig>  and ep =  <dig> . this phenomenon is well understood, and some authors name it "contamination"  <cit> : the highly overrepresented expressed motif contaminates the calculation of low expressed segments. the program r'mes  <cit>  lists precisely uss motifs and their variants showing this behavior. one idea to assess the statistical significance excluding this bias is to delete, from the original sequence, the regions/positions where this ubiquitous 9-tuple appears  <cit> . this is approximately comparable to perform exact markov calculations and therefore can be used to further study the sequence. the obtained values for the transformed sequence were nevertheless very low around ep =  <dig>  . after investigation what might be happening it was found that other motifs emerged even when uss were all deleted from the genome.

for example, the 8-tuple aaaatttt  appears with high ep values, along with other motifs constituted by long successions of a's and t's. these long adenine-thymine tracts, previously detected for other organisms such as yeast  <cit> , might have an important role due to their strong dna bending properties  <cit> . although the detection of chi sites failed, other motifs emerged that have notable biological functions and roles in the cell.

this effort highlight an important possible procedure, to be explored further, that one should plot the motifs hierarchically and delete the influence of more ubiquitous motifs that highly "pollute" the calculations, starting from the most exceptional. in fact, from the profile information we could further envisage an algorithm that automatically extracts putative motifs for each position. this is accomplished by searching the parameters space for which the estimation is maximal for position i:

 i=arg⁡max⁡l,φg^l,φ 

and then use these parameters to retrieve the suffix mi=si−lmax⁡+1⋯si.

using this methodology one obtains precisely the implanted motifs of the previous datasets. as an example, the "tata"-box referred to before is correctly inferred and also the above mentioned examples with the artificial sequences .

it should be stressed however that this is not the most convenient procedure for motif inference problems since several algorithms already exist that perform these searches very efficiently. nevertheless is interesting to find that combinatorial and probabilistic methodologies are comparable as the latter come with broader opportunities for theory development albeit leading to advantageous numerical solutions. the observation that there is a close relationship between the overrepresentation, detected by the majority of the algorithms, and the proposed entropic profiles with its density and statistical significance measure suggests that it could provide a way of simultaneously finding and statistically classifying the motifs instead of pursuing the two goals separately.

the analysis also showed that the statistical significance z-scores and p-values are unequivocally related with the entropic profiles, since most of the algorithms detected the same motifs. over-represented motifs exhibit a very low p-value, very near zero, and high z-scores and ep values; common motifs, that appear a median and/or expected number of times, have high p-values and low z-scores, which indicate its non-exceptionality under the markov chain model considered. these are the motifs that also attain low ep values. the full correspondence between both methods is still under study.

by expressing the density estimation as a function of the suffix counts, one is also allowed to search for under-represented segments, i.e., those whose density is below average. although not explored in this work, minimum entropic profile values might also play a role in under-represented motifs detection. in fact, rare motifs/substrings are known to correspond to traits/regions with very specific functions in high precision biological processes. the use of unique sub-strings, or unimarkers, that appear only once in the genome, recently allowed to locate single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . these unique substrings were shown to be clustered close to genes  <cit> . all these positions can be detected as low-density areas in the cgr and consequently correspond to local minima in their entropic profiles. another example also related with low-density points is related with 6-tuple palindromes. these short sequences, which often correspond to restriction sites, are under-represented in e. coli and in the bacteriophage lambda  <cit> , thus providing a self-protecting effect. more generally this methodology can be used to find heterogeneous traits in the genome, both related with local under- and over- representation of motifs. this result can indicate the presence of foreign material which can have significant applications in the detection of horizontal transfer  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, entropic profiles  were proposed as a novel local information entropy measure for dna sequences. this function is built on previous work on continuous rényi quadratic entropy where the parzen window method was applied to the non-parametric density estimation of the chaos game representation/universal sequence maps  of a sequence. subsequently, the estimation was decisively refined to the accuracy that the determination of local entropy requires. this advance, reported elsewhere, introduced a two-parameter fractal-based kernel, instead of gaussian functions, which is more adequate to the geometry of the cgr domain.

the entropic profiles proposed here assess point/symbol normalized deviations from a mean composition signature. ep calculation was based on a density estimation value per position, thus depicting local sequence information related with the statistical significance of a motif, measured as its global over- or under-representation. furthermore, it was shown that using this kernel the ep can be calculated independently from a particular representation. the local genome scale  is defined by the combination of parameters for which a particular suffix emerges. therefore, this scanning procedure identifies simultaneously the position and the scale at with the sequence composition is singular, by focusing and adjusting the best parameters locally and then looking back to the overall sequence. there is a strong biological rationale for such an approach as the genome is organized to conserve motifs at different scales  and with varying stringency. the underlying hypothesis is that over- or underrepresented motifs may be indicative of important biological functions.

this conclusion was illustrated with the analysis of artificial dna sequences, reference genomic datasets and also whole genomes from e. coli and h. influenzae, where known regulatory components and motifs were correctly recovered – both as regards position and scale  of the conserved segments. by spanning the parameter space of this new function it was possible to study the local scale for which a given suffix and position were implicit. this effort highlighted the interaction between several methodologies in this field. specifically, it greatly simplifies the exploration of fundamental relationships between distinct sequence analysis approaches and concepts such as metrics on strings, information theory and entropy, iterated function systems and statistical significance of dna segments, providing a common ground in kernel-based learning theory.

the procedure proposed here is easily extendable to other kernel function classes, which might be more adequate to model specific traits or genomes. future work includes the generalization for point mutations and also dealing with nested or embedded motifs.

the proposed entropic profiles provide promising new tools for the study of biological sequences, allowing the quantification of repeatability and identifying key parameters for which relevant features arise.
