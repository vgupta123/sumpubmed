BACKGROUND
wheat has a primary position in the human diet, and together with maize and rice provides more than 60% of the calories and proteins consumed by the world population  <cit> . for the majority of the population, ingestion of wheat does not stimulate an immune response. however, in some genetically susceptible individuals, wheat proteins induce an acute mucosal inflammatory response known as celiac disease  <cit>  or baker's asthma  <cit> . data are also accumulating that dietary wheat proteins promote an inflammatory response in the gut mucosa of patients with autoimmune type  <dig> diabetes   <cit> .

a wheat storage globulin has been associated with the development of t1d  <cit> . this protein was identified by screening a wheat cdna expression library with polyclonal antibodies from diabetic bb rats, a model of spontaneous autoimmune t1d  <cit> . antibody reactivity to the gene product of one cdna clone wp <dig> was shown to correlate with pancreatic islet damage and inflammation in diabetic bb rats. the wp <dig> cdna shared 90% nucleotide identity with a  <dig> nucleotide region of the sequence m <dig> which was annotated in the ncbi database as a wheat 7s globulin sequence, and which has subsequently been attributed to barley  <cit> . it also shares 100% identity with a triticum aestivum assembled transcript  designated as a homologue to barley globulin beg <dig> precursor.

7s globulin proteins have been previously characterized in barley at the cdna level and in maize at the protein level  <cit> . a single homologous gene encodes both globulins, beg <dig> in barley and glb <dig> in maize  <cit> . in wheat, globulin  <dig>  triticin and globulin  <dig> have been described  <cit> . other storage proteins have also been shown to be immunomodulatory. specifically, various vicilins have been identified as major allergens in a variety of foods, including peanut , cashew , walnut , and soybean   <cit> .

in an effort to identify the gene encoding wp <dig>  we screened a wheat glenlea genomic library using wp <dig> cdna as a probe. this approach enabled us to identify and characterize the three novel wheat genes glo-3a, glo-3b and glo-3c that encode 7s globulins.

RESULTS
identification of wp5212-like dna sequences from the hexaploid wheat genome
a total of  <dig> positive bac clones were identified by screening  <dig> high-density filters of the hexaploid wheat triticum aestivum cultivar glenlea bac library  with the wp <dig> specific probe. twenty-two positive clones were confirmed to contain wp5212-like inserts through pcr analysis. secondary screening by dna sequencing confirmed three unique sequences.

sequencing of wp5212-like sequences from positive bac clones
out of  <dig> candidates, three unique clones, 1333a <dig>  895n <dig>  and 1324m <dig> were chosen to be sequenced. sequencing primers were designed based on conserved regions in cdnas from wp <dig>  barley beg <dig>  and maize glb <dig>  determined by sequence alignment. sequencing was conducted by primer walking. obtained dna sequences were assembled into contigs of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp nucleotides for 1333a <dig>  895n <dig> and 1324m <dig>  respectively.

sequence characterization and open reading frame identification
contigs from clones 1333a <dig> and 895n <dig> contained full genomic sequences for a globulin gene as determined by open reading frame analysis. the globulin gene open reading frame starts at base pair  <dig> in bac clone 1333a <dig> and at base pair  <dig> in bac clone 895n <dig>  for the 1324m <dig> clone,  <dig> bp orf was delineated, but no stop codon was identified. however, a partial 5' coding sequence was identified, starting at position  <dig> in 1324m <dig> contig.

no similarity to previously identified wheat globulin genes was found, thus the specific genes were named glo-3a, glo-3b and glo-3c in the order they were identified . all three sequences have been entered into genbank . putative open reading frames, the transcription start sites and the polyadenylation signal sequences were identified . all sequences contain five to seven exons and four to six introns.

comparisons between the cdna clone wp <dig> and the coding region of glo-3a showed 99% identity at the nucleotide level. translated sequence alignment with the predicted amino acid sequence of cdna clone wp <dig> resulted in 99% identity:  <dig> identical,  <dig> conserved  and  <dig> non-conserved  amino acids out of  <dig> total amino acid residues . similarly, 99% identity was shared between glo-3a and the assembled wheat transcript , composed of  <dig> t. aestivum ests, known to be 100% identical to wp <dig>  importantly, taken together these results demonstrate that the correct terminology for the wp <dig> homologue in wheat  should now be named glo-3a.

the alignment of glo-3b with glo-3c indicated that both genes share 88% and 70% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. glo-3b and glo-3c share 91% and 95% identity with the glo-3a sequence at the nucleotide level, and 74% and 93% identity at the amino acid level. the deduced translation product identified two cupin domains in glo-3a  and one in glo-3b  and glo-3c . cupin domains are common features among vicilins. they are important for nutrition and also play a role in immunoactivation  <cit> . proteins expressed from glo-3a and glo-3b would be  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, and have predicted pis of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

promoter identification and regulatory elements
the  <dig> bp of the 5' flanking sequence of glo-3a were analyzed to identify a potential promoter using tssp, a plant promoter recognition program  and plantprom database  <cit> . a putative promoter region was indicated to be between - <dig> and - <dig> upstream of the atg start codon. the promoter region was analyzed for potential cis-acting elements using the place database  <cit> . multiple putative cis-acting elements were identified . the promoter region includes potential binding sites for transcription factors, such as bzip and dof. presence of the abscisic acid response element abre suggests the expression of glo-3a is hormone-regulated. several elements related to tissue specific expression were also found, including e-box, ry repeat, pyrimidine box, c-box, t-box, and a prolamin-box.

transcriptional activity
the presence of glo-3a mrna in t. aestivum cv. glenlea seeds  <dig> days post anthesis demonstrates that this gene is actively transcribed. primers that correspond to highly conserved regions of glo-3a, glo-3b, glo-3c, barley beg <dig> and maize glb <dig>  so they could bind to a transcript from any of the three sequences, were used to identify glo- <dig> transcripts. since the 3' end of glo-3c was not recovered during primer walking, we designed our primers on the assumption that the 3' region of glo-3c was similar to the other glo- <dig> genes and, if transcribed, would be amplified during rt-pcr analysis. a cdna fragment of  <dig> bp, sequenced from the rt-pcr product, was 100% identical with the glo-3a predicted cdna sequence in the studied region and corroborated the predicted intron-exon structures . however, rt-pcr products for glo-3b and glo-3c were not observed. transcriptional activity of glo-3a was further supported by blast analysis of wheat est databases. at least  <dig> est sequences from the hexaploid wheat t. aestivum shared high similarity with glo-3a and glo-3b and  <dig> ests with glo-3c . among the total of  <dig> ests matching to glo-3a,  <dig> ests were from the developing or mature seed. relatively few, only  <dig>  ests were from t. aestivum glenlea developing seed library  <dig> dpa, the same cultivar and sampling time used for constructing the genomic library screened in this study and rt-pcr analysis, respectively. with respect to tissue-specific glo- <dig> gene expression, eight est sequences from t. turgidum durum seedling library were identified. also, a highly homologous est clone  from t. monococcum est vernalized apex library was found. mapped ests  indicated the location of glo-3a to be on the 4al and/or 4bs chromosome .

gene family size: determining glo- <dig> gene copy number in wheat
wheat cultivars were screened by southern blot to identify possible genetic lines that might be devoid of wp5212-like proteins. dna was extracted from cultivars representing all ploidy levels: t. aestivum ac barrie , t. aestivum glenlea , t. aestivum chinese spring , t. aestivum spelta , t. turgidum durum kyle , t. turgidum dicoccum , t. monococcum monococcum , aegilops speltoides , and ae. tauschii . a  <dig> bp fragment, amplified from the highly conserved region among all of the three bac clones was used as a hybridization probe. all of the cultivars examined contained glo- <dig> genes. based solely on the number of bands, there are at least two copies of glo- <dig> genes in a, b and d diploid genomes and at least four homologous copies in tetraploid and hexaploid genomes .

immunolocalization
immunofluorescence labeling using rabbit anti-wp <dig> antibodies revealed the localization of corresponding globulin protein in the aleurone layer and embryo, but not the endosperm of wheat seed sections . observed fluorescence in wheat seed coat is attributable to background non-specific binding. wp <dig> was shown to share immunodominant epitopes to the peanut allergen ara h <dig>  the same antibodies bound proteins from peanut cotyledon . wp <dig> pre-immune serum did not localize to the embryo, endosperm or aleurone layer in wheat or cotyledons in peanut .

discussion
we identified three new globulin genes in glenlea cultivar of hexaploid wheat, glo-3a, glo-3b and glo-3c. these genes share a high degree  of nucleotide sequence identity, with occasional amino acid substitutions and indels at specific regions. one of the three, glo-3a, was identified as the genomic sequence corresponding to the wp <dig> cdna sequence  <cit>  sharing 99% identity at the amino acid level. these data confirm that wp <dig> is expressed in commercial wheat. the five amino acid difference between wp <dig> from ac barrie and glo-3a from glenlea could be explained by natural genetic variation due to their origin from two distinct cultivars. the cdna clone wp <dig> was isolated from the ac barrie cultivar and the glo-3a gene was identified from the glenlea cultivar. conservation of storage protein genes in wheat is common. comparison of puroindoline gene sequences from triticum and aegilops taxa identified an average of  <dig> % identity within one taxonomic group  <cit> .

dna hybridization studies using diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat samples confirmed the presence of glo-3-like genes at all ploidy levels. the restriction enzymes xba i and xho i do not have restriction sites within any globulin sequence. therefore, these southern blots are assumed to represent individual copies of glo- <dig> genes. multiple bands of different intensities were observed on the fluorograph for all of the studied wheat cultivars . our results indicate the presence of multiple copies of glo- <dig> genes in all genomes analyzed . the presence of homologous copies in each ploidy level indicates that a glo- <dig> sequence has been present during the evolution of all of the wheat lines examined. additionally, since only one probe designed to recognize one region was used, a broader range of probes may provide a truer measure of glo- <dig> copy number. the data suggest that the likelihood of identifying or selecting for a glo- <dig> globulin-negative wheat variety from existing breeding stocks is low. although bac screening of the hexaploid wheat glenlea identified three unique glo- <dig> genes, it is possible that other homologous sequences exist. there is evidence to support an association between wheat intake and t1d, but the basis of this association and the link to specific molecules remains an open question  <cit> . nonetheless, the present study using a reverse genetics approach, demonstrates the presence of three novel wheat globulins that are potentially antigenic in patients with t1d and that are present in commercial wheats. further extensive sequence variance analysis would be required before tools such as sirna gene silencing could be applied to silence the expression of glo- <dig> genes.

in polyploid plants, usually only one homologous sequence is transcribed, and the redundant copies are silenced  <cit> . of the three genomic globulin copies, rt-pcr analysis showed that the sequence of glo-3a is transcribed  <dig> days post anthesis , a time when 7s vicilins are known to be deposited in developing dicot seeds  <cit> . similarly, beg <dig> expression has been shown via northern analysis to start at  <dig> dpa in barley grain and continues until the maturity of the seed  <cit> . glo-3b and glo-3c were not found to be expressed in this study at  <dig> dpa, but further analysis could show their expression at alternate time points.

screening of genbank est libraries with glo- <dig> genes returned over  <dig> highly similar ests . the three datasets exhibit similar results – the same ests were identified by all three glo- <dig> genes, which are attributed to their high degree of identity. the smaller number in the glo-3c dataset is due to the missing 3' end, since ests are biased toward the 3'end. among the others,  <dig> ests from the  <dig> dpa glenlea library were found, whereas no matches were found from the  <dig> dpa library of the same source. this supports the prediction that glo- <dig> genes in t. aestivum glenlea are expressed  <dig> dpa. however, screening  <dig> different libraries  identified a small yet significant number of ests detected in very early stages of seed development, pre-anthesis flower tissues  and  <dig> dpa seeds . taken together, the presence of more than  <dig> corresponding est sequences in the wheat triticum est database provides further evidence that glo- <dig> genes are indeed actively transcribed in a temporally controlled manner.

the majority of the matching ests  were isolated from the developing or mature seed. interestingly,  <dig> ests from t. turgidum durum seedling est library were found to be 99% identical within a  <dig> bp region, which indicates that glo- <dig> genes could be expressed in tissues other than seed. to delineate the tightness of spatio-temporal gene regulation requires further experiments to determine the expression patterns of these particular globulins in non-seed tissues of monocots.

screening the mapped est database with glo-3a identified a clone previously mapped to the 4al and/or 4bs chromosome . in addition, another est clone  from t. monococcum, the a genome progenitor, was found through a genbank triticum est database search. these findings suggest that at least one active copy of glo-3a is located on chromosome 4al/bs. however, the est databases of t. monococcum contain  <dig>  ests, ae. speltoides  <dig>  ests and ae. tauschii only  <dig> ests, which makes the in silico transcriptional analysis of glo- <dig> genes from different genomes limited or premature.

putative regulatory elements were identified in the 5' upstream sequence of glo-3a by searching the place database  <cit>  . the prolamin-box located - <dig> on the negative strand is required for endosperm specific expression, but has been shown to be inactive without a concomitant gcn <dig> element. this element was not observed in the promoter region of the glo- <dig> genes supporting our immunolocalization data showing that the wp <dig> protein does not localize to the endosperm  <cit> .

the presence of an abre element, the abscisic acid responsive element from the early methionine-labeled em gene of wheat  <cit> , at  <dig> nucleotides 5' to the start codon suggests that glo-3a expression could be regulated by abscisic acid . abscisic acid is a hormone that has been shown to regulate maize glb <dig> expression  <cit> . maize glb <dig> synthesis and accumulation are positively regulated by aba through suppressing germination and degradation over the course of embryogenesis  <cit> . these results suggest that aba influences storage globulin accumulation by initiating synthesis, suppressing degradation, and inhibiting precocious germination.

e-box and ry elements, also found within the promoter region, could be responsible for embryo-specific expression in wheat as shown in arabidopsis using phas promoter  <cit> . also, it has been shown that mutations in the ry repeat abolish the seed specific expression  <cit> . taken together, the presence of the specific promoter regulatory elements observed in the glo- <dig> genes suggests not only seed-specific gene expression, but describes an active gene that is specifically expressed in the aleurone layer and the embryo.

the est analysis also indicates that glo- <dig> expression is mostly limited to seed tissue . indeed, immunolocalization studies confirmed that expression of glo- <dig> was restricted to the aleurone layer and embryo within the wheat grain . this is consistent with the observation that the essential endosperm specific regulatory elements, namely the dna binding site gcn <dig>  are not present in the glo-3a promoter region . interestingly, a similar staining pattern was noted in peanut cotyledons . wp <dig> was originally shown to share amino acid homology with the peanut allergen ara h i  <cit> , and our data indicate that antibodies raised against wp <dig> also recognize proteins in peanuts. therefore, we propose that these immunomodulatory proteins could share common antigenic epitopes.

based on solubility, we speculated that the wp <dig> protein could be one of many normal trace contaminants found in wheat gluten and this was demonstrated by 2d gel electrophoresis  <cit> . gluten consists of gliadins and glutelins, and these proteins are expressed in the endosperm and are not present in aleurone tissue  <cit> . it is of interest to determine whether wp <dig> is present in white flour, which is derived from the endosperm, and in industrial gluten, which is produced from whole wheat.

CONCLUSIONS
wp <dig> was first identified by probing a wheat cdna library with antibodies from diabetic rats. the goal of the current work was to identify wp5212-like genes. three new globulin gene sequences, glo-3a, glo-3b and glo-3c, from hexaploid wheat were identified and characterized. glo-3a was shown to be the genomic counterpart of the cdna clone wp <dig> and is located on chromosome  <dig> in the wheat genome. as more full-length sequences become available for the glo- <dig> genes and proteins, it will be possible to establish their evolutionary relationship. the glo-3a gene was actively transcribed and its protein product localized to the seed coat, aleurone and embryo tissue in the developing seed. we did not identify a glo-3-negative cultivar suggesting that this gene is evolutionarily conserved. these studies have identified the glo-3a gene that shares 99% identity with the cdna of a wp <dig> protein, previously associated with autoimmune t1d and have identified a new globulin gene family that consists of glo-3a and at least two other genes, glo-3b and glo-3c. these findings, identification of the genes whose homologues code for wheat proteins potentially associated with the pathogenesis of t1d, prompt consideration since they are present in the germ and bran layer of commercial wheats, which are significant nutritional components of the human diet.
