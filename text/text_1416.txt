BACKGROUND
xenopus tropicalis is now an anuran amphibian reference genome for vertebrate comparative genomics. it presents the same advantages as xenopus laevis but has a smaller genome of  <dig>  gbp and a shorter generation time  <cit> . moreover, while x. laevis is an allotetraploid derived from an allopolyploidization event, x. tropicalis is diploid  <cit> . even though phylogenetic studies indicate that  <dig> to  <dig> my evolution separate the two species  <cit> , it has been shown that most methods and resources developed for x. laevis can be readily applied to x. tropicalis  <cit> . thus, the genome of x. tropicalis was selected to explore amphibian genome characteristics by whole-genome shotgun sequencing  <cit> .

working on x. laevis constitutes a challenge when dealing with large-scale transcriptomics, such as microarrays experiments or systematic cdna sequencing. this is because some x. laevis genes are present as diploids, while others form pairs of paralogs  that have been conserved with various degrees of divergence, generally less than 10%  <cit> . on a genomic scale, recent data has led to the estimation of 12% as the minimal fraction of paralogous gene pairs kept after allotetraploidization  <cit> . however, this estimate is based on the application of strict and conservative criteria: less than 98% nucleotidic similarity and 93% mean similarity between paralogs. therefore, it is likely that more than 12% of paralogs are indeed active genes in x. laevis. moreover, such pairs of genes may have distinct expression patterns  <cit> . an estimated 14% of paralogs show distinct expression profiles based on est counts  <cit> . given these complications, it follows that the x. tropicalis genome is more amenable to systematic transcriptome surveys than that of x. laevis

transcriptome analysis relies heavily on cdna analysis. collections of cdna sequences have multiple uses for the molecular geneticist. they can be used to establish transcript catalogues  <cit>  and to provide experimental evidence when building gene models from genomic sequence, particularly for 5' and 3' untranslated sequences  <cit> . further, they can be used to provide global views on genome expression in a given cell type by the estimation of the abundance of the different mrna species  and therefore can help decipher physiological roles played by a given gene product. finally, partial cdna sequences  are used to identify full-length clones containing the entire open-reading frame for each transcript  <cit> .

we initiated an est program so as to provide a functional genomics resource for x. tropicalis containing sequences from the highest possible number of genes expressed in the nervous system. we report the construction of such a gene index and its assessment after the collection of  <dig>  partial cdna sequences. these ests are estimated to represent  <dig>  genes that were annotated through sequence similarity searches, protein domain searches and gene ontology functional classification. gene expression profiles were derived from est counts and used to evidence transcripts differentially expressed at metamorphic stages of development. a set of polymorphic intragenic microsatellite markers was deduced from the analysis of ests derived from distinct strains of x. tropicalis. we expect that this resource will be valuable for further molecular genetics experiments.

RESULTS
construction of cdna libraries and normalization
two x. tropicalis cdna libraries were constructed for this project. the first, designated xthr, was derived from dissected retinas and heads of young tadpoles . about  <dig> retinas were dissected from stage  <dig> x. tropicalis embryos, a stage where differentiating retinal neurons are getting organized into layers. because these retinas yielded only few polya+ rna, the library was enriched by the addition of mrna from heads of embryos of the same developmental stage. the second library, designated xtbs, was made from central nervous systems of metamorphosing tadpoles. brains and spinal cords were dissected from tadpoles between stage  <dig> and  <dig>  the period covering the whole of xenopus metamorphosis. to build the library, and with the aim of respecting the relative proportion of nervous tissue obtained at the different stages, samples for six animals were pooled for each stage between 58– <dig> and three animals for each stage between 62– <dig>  all these tissues were combined and the mrna extracted for preparation of the xtbs library. the smart technology  was used to enrich the representation of full-length cdna clones .

to increase the information derived from est projects, it is necessary to sample complex or normalised cdna libraries with few overrepresented cdna clones . to evaluate our libraries quality, samples of  <dig>  cdnas from xthr and  <dig>  cdna from xtbs were partially sequenced  to obtain  <dig>  ests. next, a normalization step was performed to increase the diversity of sequence tags. we used a set of  <dig> oligonucleotides  corresponding to highly represented clones  in hybridizations on high-density colony filters . a total of  <dig>  clones were scored as positives  with an estimated false positive level of  <dig> and 3%, and an estimated false negative level of  <dig> and 10% for xthr and xtbs libraries, respectively. the negatively scored clones were re-arrayed to further the project using both 5' and 3' sequencing. the further sequencing of cdna clones provided  <dig>  high-quality sequences derived from  <dig>  clones after trimming  <dig>  reads . both 5' and 3' end sequences were read for 75% of the cdna clones, therefore reducing the difficulties associated with est clustering. moreover, this strategy helps to determine the choice of a given cdna clone for further experiments, whether it be full-length cdna sequencing, overexpression studies or complementary rna in vitro synthesis.

to determine if the normalization process was successful, the number of sequences containing each oligonucleotide probe was counted before and after normalization . before normalization, the  <dig> clusters from which the probes were derived accounted for 18% of the  <dig>  ests. this fraction dropped to 1% after normalization, confirming the efficacy of the method. of the  <dig> clusters corresponding to nuclear genes,  <dig>  have  <dig> or more corresponding ests and  <dig>  have  <dig> or more ests after normalization. we conclude that the abundance of ests after normalisation was sufficient in the majority of cases. even though this strategy requires re-arraying, there is no bias due to insert length compared to normalization by re-association  <cit>  and therefore constitutes a useful alternative.

est assembly
we analyzed these sequences with phrap  <cit>  to build contigs out of the overlapping and redundant sequences . a total of  <dig>  sequences were assembled into  <dig>  contigs. these were further grouped by virtue of clone links into  <dig>  unique groups . taking into account the  <dig>  singletons issued from  <dig>  clones, a total of  <dig>  transcripts sequences were identified. we compared our results to the global clustering of all x. tropicalis ests  by the unigene pipeline and the dfci gene index. in unigene, our set of ests belong to  <dig>  groups made of between  <dig> and  <dig> clones. similarly, the dfci xenopus tropicalis gene index clustered these ests in  <dig>  tcs and  <dig>  singletons.

the majority of clusters  contained three or less ests. only  <dig> contigs were composed of more than  <dig> sequences  and the largest contig contained  <dig> sequences. most of the corresponding gene products  are ribosomal proteins, the other being proteins involved in basic cellular processes . two noteworthy exceptions are myelin basic protein  and metallothionein , for which transcripts are found almost exclusively in the nervous sytem.

the sequence redundancy  of xthr and xtbs libraries was compared to other x. tropicalis cdna libraries represented in dbest . a statistically significant difference at the 1% level of significance indicates that the complexity is higher for adult-type cdna libraries, whether or not a size fractionation was performed. amongst cdna libraries prepared from embryonic or larval stages of development, the complexity of the xtbs library ranks first, while the complexity of the xthr library is close to the mean value.

sequences were assembled into contigs of up to  <dig> kb in size , but the mean contig length of  <dig> bp indicated that most of them cover only parts of the cognate transcript sequence.

to assess the fraction of clones likely to be full-length, we estimated the number of sequences in our dataset that extends over the 5' or 3' end of complete cdna sequences . using conservative criteria, at least one 5'est was found to provide additional 5' upstream or 3' downstream sequence for  <dig> complete cdnas . using the same criteria but only on contig sequences, further sequence information was obtained on  <dig> complete cdnas . of these full-length cdnas,  <dig> are completely matched by  <dig> contigs, and the latter are all longer. these results provide an indication of the added-value of this sequence resource in the framework of the delineation of gene structure, especially with respect to the determination of the transcription initiation site.

another way to assess the fraction of clones likely to be full-length has been described by gilchrist et al.  <cit> . using this method on all x. tropicalis cdna sequences  xthr and xtbs libraries we found to contain respectively 42% and 37% of full-length clones . the mean fraction of full-length clones across all libraries is 18%. therefore, we conclude that our normalization procedure did not impair the proportion of full-length clones compared to non-normalized libraries.

sequence annotations
in order to further analyse our dataset, we compared our contigs to ensembl predicted transcripts. altogether,  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singletons  matched  <dig>  transcripts from  <dig>  ensembl predicted genes . the extent of the underclustering of our ests was estimated from these numbers and used to calculate that our whole est set represents about  <dig>  genes. we conclude that our cdna sequence collection significantly improved annotation of the x. tropicalis genome sequence. similarly, we compared our dataset to  <dig>  x. tropicalis refseq mrna sequences. we found that  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singletons matched  <dig>  refseq entries . these figures suggest that further extensive sequencing of putative full-length cdna clones from our collection will be of great use in order to cover the entire xenopus gene set.

we next estimated the proportion of our cdna sequences representing mrna molecules produced by a splicing event and hence most likely to correspond to physiological products. we used "exonerate" to compute alignments between cdna and genomic sequences. we retained only the alignments satisfying the thresholds of 95% identity and 90% coverage. evidence of splicing was found for  <dig>  contigs  out of  <dig>  contigs aligned to the genome. from the  <dig>  contigs left, only  <dig> are significantly similar to a protein sequence and it is likely that the others represent 3' untranslated regions, often encoded by a single exon in vertebrates.

next, two complimentary methods were used to find evidence for alternative splicing. using genomic sequences  we predicted  <dig> cases of alternative splicing, including conserved ones such as clathrin light chain . using alignments on protein and genomic sequences we found  <dig> cases .

our set of transcript sequences was annotated using similarity searches in nucleotidic and protein databases and motif searches . of the  <dig>  contigs, 62% have more than 70% nucleotidic similarity to previously described x. laevis regular entries, and may be considered as "known" xenopus genes. of these sequences,  <dig>  had significant similarity to  <dig>  protein sequences in swissprot database, and  <dig>  to  <dig>  cluster of the uniref <dig> database. we identified  <dig> sequences corresponding to the xenopus orthologs of human disease genes . further molecular studies on these genes in xenopus will be useful for understanding the physiopathology of these diseases.

putative coding regions were identified using framesearch, and corresponding protein sequences were annotated using interproscan, allowing for an automatic gene ontology annotation .

several known genes specifically expressed in the eye were identified, including different crystallins , vsx <dig> , pax <dig> , rdgb , rgr . well-characterised central nervous system specific genes were identified as well, notably elrc, mbp , plp . the corresponding cdnas will provide useful differentiation markers for x. tropicalis.

a significant number of the contigs  had no significant similarities to previously described genes, and may represent transcribed pseudogenes, non-coding rna sequences and undescribed genes. indeed, comparing our sequences to non-coding rna sequences  we found  <dig> microrna precursors  as well as e <dig>  and 5sn <dig>  snornas. contig <dig>  is derived from the assembly of  <dig> ests derived from  <dig> distinct cdna clones of the xtbs library. the alignment of contig <dig> sequence on x. tropicalis genome sequence reveals 100% identity and indicates that one splicing event is required. thus, contig <dig> represents a bona fide neural transcript of the mir-9- <dig> gene. contig <dig>  is derived from the assembly of  <dig> ests derived from  <dig> cdna clones . four of these clones are identical and characterized by a  <dig> bp cdna, while two are longer and have their 3' ends ests as singletons but mapping to the same scaffold region.

expression profiles
other collections of x. tropicalis ests are ongoing  <cit>  using a variety of cdna libraries made from adult tissues or embryos at different stages of development. hence, we undertook an in silico analysis of gene expression profiles estimated from est counts  <cit> .

in a first analysis, we searched transcripts identified by ests derived predominantly from our cdna libraries. we identified  <dig> and  <dig> cdnas found prominently in the heads and retinas of tailbuds or brain and spinal cord of tadpole, respectively  and  <dig> clones found predominantly in both structures. these clones are likely to represent genes differentially expressed in the retina or the central or peripheral nervous system during metamorphosis. the study of these genes in xenopus could well improve our knowledge on cns development and function in vertebrates.

metamorphosis
in a second analysis, we explored the metamorphosis transcriptomes using expression profiles derived from est counts. it is known that amphibian metamorphosis brings about unique regulations triggered by thyroid hormones during late vertebrate development, but relatively few genes are characterised as playing regulatory roles in this process  <cit> . we extracted  <dig>  unigene clusters containing at least one est from the xtbs cdna library. similarly, we fetched data from  <dig> unigene clusters containing at least one and up to  <dig> ests from another library derived from a metamorphic stage of development. combining both sets gives  <dig>  unigene clusters . to generate a useful expression matrix an initial filtration step was performed whereby clusters composed of less than  <dig> ests were removed leading to a set of  <dig>  unigene clusters. we used the gt test  <cit>  to rank profiles in three categories: strong , medium  or weak  differential expression. because unigene is prone to overclustering we focused our analysis on the  <dig> clusters corresponding to genes with a strong differential expression and analysed their expression profiles using hierarchical clustering . twelve characteristic expression profiles are observed, corresponding to peaks of expression that are tissue  or stage-specific . the corresponding genes are potential differentiation markers that can be useful in developmental studies and can easily be checked by in situ hybridization on embryos. only one transcript tagged by ests derived solely from a metamorphic stage was identified. this transcript codes for preprocaerulein type-4; it is characterized by  <dig> ests derived from  <dig> cdna clones issued from  <dig> libraries made from stage  <dig> and  <dig> tadpoles, i.e. representing late metamorphosis stages. caerulein is a peptide found predominantly in skin secretions. it belongs to the gastrin/cholecystokinin family of neuropeptide, and may play a role as an antimicrobial molecule  <cit> . this finding is discussed later.

since there are currently ten times more ests in cdna libraries derived from metamorphic stages of development in x. laevis than in x. tropicalis, we did a similar survey of the expression profiles of transcripts in x. laevis.

we extracted  <dig>  unigene clusters  containing at least one and up to  <dig> ests from at least one cdna library prepared from metamorphic tadpoles. this corresponds to  <dig>  ests made from four cdna libraries: limb, tail, intestine and tadpole . the level of expression of each transcript was estimated by counting ests providing a corresponding unigene cluster. the  <dig> clusters containing the highest number of ests, and hence corresponding to the most highly expressed genes during metamorphosis, are listed in table  <dig>  we expected to find either ubiquitously or differentially expressed categories among these highly abundant transcripts at metamorphosis stages. indeed,  <dig> of these  <dig> unigene clusters are found as characterized by a restricted expression in the tail, limb, or heart . interestingly, it is known that  <dig> are expressed in the muscle cells that compose most of the tail and limb. one remarkable case is a gene coding for a protein involved in freeze-tolerance found predominantly in metamorphic limbs, but expressed in a variety of other tissues both embryonic  and adult . this can be an artefact due to the handling of tissues at the time of rna extraction. alternatively, this may reflect the induction by stress-related hormones  during metamorphosis.

we then carried out an in silico reconstruction of the transcriptional profile of x. laevis metamorphic genes using the ideg suite of statistical tests. we removed clusters composed of less than  <dig> ests, leading to a set of  <dig>  unigene clusters. the gt test ranked profiles in three categories: strong  medium  or weak  differential expression.

from the  <dig> clusters corresponding to genes with a strong differential expression, only  <dig> are composed of at least  <dig> ests derived solely from metamorphic or adult tissues, four of which bear no similarity to known proteins. we analysed the expression profiles of these metamorphic genes using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. the resulting clusters could be interpreted along the predominant expression domains . three clusters  correspond to larval stages of development that are made of eight, three and four genes, respectively . these genes are promising candidates, potentially playing important roles during this late developmental event. below, we describe briefly what is known about each of these genes.

a larval beta chain of globin is among the metamorphic cluster together with an alpha chain, an indication of the relevance of our analysis. the comparison of xl. <dig> est sequences with known proteins shows that they resemble cell surface receptors of the slam  family. the slam receptors regulate immune cell activation. indeed, it is known that immune system remodelling is a major event of metamorphosis  <cit> . the gene corresponding to xl. <dig> is expressed in metamorphic tadpoles  as well as in the adult kidney. however we could not detect significant similarities to any known gene sequences or proteins. alpha- <dig> antichymotrypsin  is highly expressed during metamorphosis and found in adult liver. this correlates with the associated stress condition that occurs during tadpole transformations. the gene encoding alpha-2-hs-glycoprotein  steadily increases in expression from tailbud stage up to metamorphosis. this gene product is secreted in plasma and plays a physiological role during mammalian fetal development, especially in mineralization and growth. a known xenopus gene encoding a small peptide named pyla is found exclusively in a cdna library prepared from stage  <dig> tadpoles. as for the preprocaerulein transcripts in x. tropicalis, the pyla transcripts are abundant in metamorphic stages, with ests found in limbs and whole tadpoles. both caerulein and pyla peptides may be secreted from skin glands and exert antimicrobial activities. this finding corroborates a previous report on caerulein expression  <cit> . remarkably, skin glands are known to express a cocktail of signalling peptides, including neuropeptides such as xenopsin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone and pgla. whether these peptides play specific roles in the context of metamorphosis is unknown. the cluster xl. <dig> corresponds to a gene resembling uromodulin. corresponding transcripts are found in metamorphic intestine and whole tadpole. in mammals, uromodulin is excreted in urine and plays a role in the cellular defense response. a gene encoding a stomatin homolog is highly expressed in intestine during metamorphosis. stomatin is a membrane protein regulating cation exchange and cytoskeletal attachment. among the genes represented in the metamorphic limb cluster are a keratin and two clusters  annotated as lacking significant similarities to known proteins. in the tadpole cluster, a carboxyl ester lipase is found expressed in tadpole and in metamorphic intestine. mucin  <dig> is another gut protein highly expressed in tadpole, as well as carboxypeptidase.

taken together, these expression profiles, based on est counts, reveals certain genes that are up-regulated during metamorphosis, possible targets of the thyroid hormones signalling pathway.

polymorphisms
the cdna sequences we produced are derived from the adiopodoume strain of x. tropicalis, originating from the ivory coast. the genomic and most other cdna sequencing efforts are made on the n strain from nigeria or a distinct ic strain from ivory coast. we therefore looked for polymorphisms that could be used in genetic mapping experiments or to discriminate with mutations obtained from enu mutagenesis. we identified  <dig> snps derived from mitochondrial genes, three of which  are specific to the adiopodoume strain . the presence of shared alleles for  <dig> snps indicates the close relationship with the n strain as already reported by evans et al.  <dig>  we searched for novel polymorphism markers made of di, tri, tetra and pentanucleotide sequence repeats present in our est collection. we found from two to ten alleles in  <dig> markers derived from  <dig> contigs/ests clusters. a subset of  <dig> markers are potential highly informative since two or more alleles are observed at high frequencies . the dinucleotide repeat at and ta are the most common, accounting for  <dig> markers. these intragenic markers should be useful once placed on a genetic linkage map.

this dataset will provide an invaluable tool for exon definition when the x. tropicalis genome sequence is finally determined. the results presented here are available through a database on our web site  <cit> . users can carry out blast and other searches based on go classification, interproscan results, and expression information. the cdna sequences have been deposited with genbank/embl/ddbj  and clones are available upon request.

CONCLUSIONS
large-scale cdna sequencing has provided invaluable resources to decipher vertebrate genome structure and function. recent studies on cdna sequencing with deep coverage provide fundamental knowledge on the complexity of transcriptomes in mammals  <cit> . here, we provide information on the transcript sequence and expression of an estimated  <dig>  genes in x. tropicalis. a web resource  <cit>  is available with associated annotations. the genetic resources stemming from the cdna sequencing project described here can be used in diverse research projects, including vertebrate comparative genomics, studies on evolution and development, cell biology and developmental genetics. more specifically, retinogenesis and remodelling of the central nervous sytem during metamorphosis will benefit from this cdna resource.

we are currently undertaking full cdna insert sequencing for a set of non-redundant clones, as well as characterizing their expression using a whole-mount in situ hybridization screen  <cit> . the genomic resources developed to study x. tropicalis biology are crucial to explore amphibian physiology and genetics, this model system providing excellent characteristics for addressing key questions related to anuran metamorphosis and its associated regulatory processes.
