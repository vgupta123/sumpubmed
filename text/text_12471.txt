BACKGROUND
the foreseeable shortage of fossil fuels has driven the search for alternative supplies for energy and plastics. plant biomass, as a renewable natural resource, has the potential to become a feedstock for conversion into fuels, chemicals, and materials. however, harnessing the benefits from the structurally complex plant cell walls remains a major challenge  <cit> . secondary cell walls, the major component of plant biomass, are primarily composed of cellulose microfibrils embedded in a matrix of hemicelluloses and lignin  <cit> . the interplay between the biomolecules  <cit>  determines the strength of the lignocellulose that inherently contributes to recalcitrance against deliberate extraction or enzymatic hydrolysis  <cit> .

o-acetylglucuronoxylans  are the most abundant hemicelluloses present in the secondary wall of dicots  <cit> . the backbones of acgxs are formed by -linked β-d-xylopyranosyl  units and are substituted by -linked α-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid glca) units every 4- <dig> xyl residues  <cit> . the acgxs are also highly substituted by acetyl residues at the 2-o and/or 3-o position of the xyl units  <cit> . more complex substitutions at acgxs in dicots are uncommon but may exist, such as an α-d-galactopyranosyl -linked to meglca found in eucalyptus  <cit> . acgxs may also associate with lignin through ester, ether, or glycosidic bonds  <cit> .

cell wall modification via in planta engineering can be utilized to design cell wall constituents with increased fermentable sugars, polymer extractability, or to tailor other lignocellulose properties  <cit> . this goal is approachable either by manipulating endogenous biosynthetic genes or by expressing microbial polysaccharides-modifying enzymes in plants. although mutating the endogenous genes related to the xylan backbone  <cit>  or the reducing end sequence synthesis  <cit>  has impaired plant growth, partially disrupting the side groups, for example, glca  <cit>  or o-acetylation  <cit> , did not seem to affect the fitness of the plant. this tolerance of plants to an altered polymer structure is exemplified by the double knockout of two glucuronosyltrasferases , gux <dig> and gux <dig>  in arabidopsis, resulting in an almost complete lack of glca substitution in the acgxs, without affecting the growth of the mutants. xylan extraction, however, was enhanced in the gux1gux <dig> mutants  <cit> .

in planta expression of a microbial enzyme offers two advantages. the exogenous enzymes can be chosen to target specific linkages in wall polysaccharides, thus affecting polymer properties in a controlled manner. it can also offer a cost-saving strategy for producing and storing lignocellulolytic enzymes in plants  <cit> . endo- <dig> -β-xylanases  are the dominant enzymes that cleave the backbone of acgxs, while α-glucuronidases  and acetyl xylan esterases  are the accessory enzymes that remove the glca and acetyl residues, respectively. several cases have reported the expression of endoxylanases in plants, either as cell wall targeted  <cit>  or intracellular enzymes  <cit> . xylans were solubilized better in endoxylanase-expressing plants indicating a potential route for the enhanced extractability of xylans and improved saccharification  <cit> .

expression of side group–modifying enzymes such as the aspergillus nidulans acetyl xylan esterase , feruloyl esterase , α-arabinofuranosidase/β-xylosidase , and the xanthomonas oryzae α-arabinofuranosidase  in arabidopsis  <cit>  has been successful without harming plant growth. whereas, the expression of phanerochaete carnosa glucuronyl esterase  in arabidopsis  <cit>  and aspen  <cit>  induced morphological changes. cell wall digestibility was mildly improved in anfae-, anxa-, xoaf and pcgce-expressing plants, but not in anaxe-expressing plants although the acetyl content was moderately decreased. as acetylation affects association between xylan chains as well as adsorption to cellulose fibrils, deacetylation may result in tighter interactions of the xylan chains and cellulose in the cell wall, and thus limit the digestibility.

in planta expression of the α-glucuronidase targeting the α-linkage between glca residue and the acgx backbone has not been attempted. two glycoside hydrolase families, that is, gh <dig> and gh <dig>  harbor α-glucuronidases that act either uniquely on the terminal  or on the internal and terminal glca, respectively   <cit> . gh <dig> α-glucuronidase from the white rot fungus schizophyllum commune is known to be active on xylan polymers  <cit> , and its gene sequence has been recently unveiled  <cit> . in this report, we show that the s. commune gh <dig> α-glucuronidase, codon optimized for expression in plants, can be produced in arabidopsis as an active enzyme. biochemical analyses of the overexpressors’ cell walls showed that the in muro acgxs, however, were largely immune to the expressed enzyme.figure  <dig> an illustration showing enzymatic actions of two α-glucuronidase families, glycoside hydrolase  <dig> and gh <dig>  acting on aldopentaouronic acid isomers. gh <dig> α-glucuronidase cleaves only the glca residue substituted on the nonreducing end of xylotetraose, while gh <dig> α-glucuronidase acts on terminally and internally substituted glca residues. agu, α-glucuronidase; x, xyl; u, glca.



RESULTS
generation of transgenic arabidopsis lines expressing the scagu <dig> α-glucuronidase in cell walls
the nucleotide sequence of scagu <dig> α-glucuronidase was optimized for plant codon usage, because rare codons could reduce the efficiency of translation or even disengage in the translational machinery  <cit> . consequently, the percentage of low frequency  codons was decreased from 3% in the original sequence to zero in the synthetic gene. the resulting cdna was cloned under the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter, and the native signal peptide was replaced by the signal peptide from the aspen cellulase pttcel9b <dig> to drive the protein to the apoplast  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence used in the overexpression vector is given in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

to verify if the aspen cellulase signal peptide effectively targeted the fusion protein to the apoplast in arabidopsis, a 35s::scagu115:green fluorescent protein  construct was cloned and expressed in arabidopsis for protein localization analysis. since the signal from the gfp was weak and labile in the cell walls due to the low ph  <cit> , the fusion protein detected instead using the anti-gfp antibody. this produced a stable signal that was visible mostly in cell walls, even after the protoplasts were plasmolyzed . the signal was also detected in protoplasts, likely corresponding to the protein in transit to cell walls. the aspen signal peptide was functional in arabidopsis, suggesting that the scagu <dig> was also secreted to the cell wall and potentially deployable for post-synthetic modification of the cell wall.figure  <dig> immunolabeling of the scagu115:egfp fusion protein in the plasmolyzed root cells of the arabidopsis seedling.  gfp localization. the shrunk protoplast is shown with an arrowhead. the arrow indicates the signal visible in the cell wall.  negative control without primary antibody. bar =  <dig> μm.



transformation of arabidopsis with 35s::cel9b3sp:scagu <dig> resulted in  <dig> independent homozygotic lines that contained a single insert as indicated by the segregation analysis in t <dig>  and  <dig> of those lines expressed the transgene, as found with rt-pcr .

extracts of transgenic lines expressing scagu <dig> exhibit enzymatic activity hydrolyzing internal glca side groups of xylan
the protein extracts from the inflorescence stems of the transgenic plants were assayed for α-glucuronidase activity using a commercial test kit. the substrate used in the kit is a mixture of aldotriouronic, aldotetraouronic, and aldopentaouronic acids  obtained by acid hydrolysis of glucuronoxylans, resulting in either internal or terminal meglca substitution. thus, this assay measures gh <dig> and gh <dig> types of activity. background α-glucuronidase activity was observed in the wild type  and was most likely due to endogenous arabidopsis nadh that was co-extracted and interfered with the detection . only 20% of the total number of transgenic lines that express the construct showed α-glucuronidase activity above the wt level . the low number of transformants showing α-glucuronidase activity was likely caused by the constitutive promoter, which may have triggered counteractive responses in plants, as has been seen in tall fescue expressing trichoderma reesei endoxylanase  <cit> .

the three lines that showed α-glucuronidase activity , and one line  that was transgenic but did not show a detectable level of α-glucuronidase activity were selected for further analysis and re-grown. rt-pcr analysis, performed on the re-grown lines, showed that the levels of the scagu <dig> transcripts were higher in lines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and lower in line  <dig> , which was consistent with the earlier activity assays. the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis of soluble proteins extracted from the stems of the transgenic and wt plants revealed the presence of two novel protein bands in lines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which were not detected in the wt and in line  <dig> . western blot analysis using the anti-scagu <dig> antibody confirmed that the novel bands contained scagu <dig>  since signals were detected in lines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , and after longer exposure in line  <dig> . the lower molecular weight protein band in the transgenic lines migrated close to the native scagu <dig> protein  at  <dig> kda  <cit> , indicating the glycosylation level in arabidopsis closely resembled that of the native fungus. the higher molecular weight protein band may represent another form of processing in arabidopsis.figure  <dig>

to test if the expressed protein was active, α-glucuronidase activity was determined from the soluble proteins extracted from the inflorescence stems. the specific α-glucuronidase activity in the soluble proteins extracted from lines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> was about five to six fold higher than the background wt level, whereas no activity above the wt level was detected in line  <dig> . activity was also detected in wall-bound proteins, at an even higher level than in the soluble fractions , confirming that there were significant amounts of wall-bound scagu <dig> enzyme in the transgenic lines.figure  <dig> analysis of scagu <dig> enzyme activity in arabidopsis transgenic and wt plants.  the soluble and wall-bound proteins were analyzed for α-glucuronidase activity using a commercial assay. the error bar represents the standard deviation of three biological replicates.  and  tlc analysis of xuxx incubated with soluble  or wall-bound  protein. xuxx, a xylotetraose carrying meglca at penultimate xylose from the nonreducing end; c, water blank; m <dig>  marker for xuxx and meglca; m <dig>  marker for xylose , xylobiose , xylotriose , and xylotetraose .



to test more specifically for the agu <dig> type of activity, the soluble extracts from arabidopsis were further analyzed for their activity toward the internally substituted aldopentaouronic acid xuxx. thin layer chromagraphy  analysis clearly showed that the xuxx substrate was degraded to xylotetraose and meglca by lines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . only a faint band corresponding to xylotetraose was produced by line  <dig>  no apparent degradation of xuxx was observed in the wt extract or water blank  or by a commercial gh <dig> enzyme tested as a comparison . xylotriose was also detected in the hydrolyzates of lines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  suggesting that the formed xylotetraose is further degraded to shorter oligosaccharides presumably by an endogenous β-xylosidase or endoxylanase likely to be present in crude protein samples  <cit> . the enzymatic activity of the wall-bound proteins was also tested against the xuxx substrate, and similar degradation profiles were observed . in summary, lines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> expressed scagu <dig> in an active form, in the apoplast, and in relatively high amounts.

plant growth and development are not compromised by expression of active scagu115
morphology of the transgenic plants  grown under long-day conditions was examined to test if the expression of scagu <dig> affected plant growth and development . there was a possibility that the agu activity could induce changes in cell walls leading to morphological changes or that certain motifs in the foreign protein could be perceived as pathogen-related molecular patterns  triggering defense responses that slow the growth  <cit> . no differences in plant height or rosette diameter were observed . the morphology of the plants was similar to those of the wt, and no obvious stress responses, such as poor growth, or leaf necrosis, or senescence, were observed.figure  <dig> morphology of transgenic and wt plants grown under long-day conditions for  <dig> weeks. the  rosette size and  plant height were not affected by the expression of active scagu <dig> 



cell wall chemistry and integrity are not affected in the arabidopsis transgenic lines that express scagu115
since the recombinant scagu <dig> possesses activity toward the internal meglca, we were interested in how the enzyme acts on the native acgx polymers within the cell wall. the alcohol insoluble residues  of the inflorescence stem tissues were examined for chemotypic changes caused by the expression of scagu <dig> in the apoplast. the analyses were performed only on lines  <dig> and  <dig> that produced the highest levels of the recombinant enzyme. the analysis of non-cellulosic sugars showed that there were no changes in the glca or other sugar components in lines  <dig> and  <dig> compared to the wt . this resulted in similar molar ratios of glca to xyl in the transgenic and wt plants . as a comparison, we studied the arabidopsis gux1gux <dig> double mutant in which the two endogenous glcats, gux <dig> and gux <dig>  were disrupted  <cit> . a significant decrease in total glca content was detected in gux1gux <dig> , and as a result, the molar ratio of glca to xyl was decreased by 70% compared to the wt . notably, the amount of xyl and man was increased by 59% and by 30%, respectively, in gux1gux <dig> compared to the wt, whereas no changes in xyl or man levels were detected in the scagu <dig> transgenic lines .table  <dig>

to further examine the xylan structure in the transgenic plants in detail, acgx was extracted with dmso after mild delignification, and the structure was analyzed with heteronuclear single quantum coherence  nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy  <cit> . with this method, it is possible to distinguish nonacetylated and acetylated xyl residues, including the ones carrying the glca substituent, and determine their relative content. no differences in the content of any of the xylan structural elements, including acetylated  and nonacetylated  meglca-xyl, were detected in the acgx samples isolated from lines  <dig> and  <dig> compared to the wt . in contrast, a drastic decrease in the glca substituted xyl was clearly detected in gux1gux <dig>  <cit> .

the guaiacyl , syringyl , and p-hydroyphenyl  lignins and the carbohydrate fraction in the transgenic and wt plants were examined via pyrolysis-gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry  . the s and g lignins remained unchanged, while the h lignin was slightly increased by 4% in line  <dig> , possibly as a stress reaction in this particular line  <cit> . the carbohydrate fraction was unchanged between the samples, indicating the main constituents of the cell wall were not affected by scagu <dig> expression. this is consistent with the comparable non-cellulosic sugar content obtained in the sugar analysis.

to visualize the distribution of the glca residues in the stem sections of the transgenic and wt plants, we labeled the basal stem sections using the glca specific antibody ux <dig>  <cit> . a weak signal was evident in the water-treated wt , especially in the interfascicular fibers, but it was missing in the water-treated samples of line  <dig>  and line  <dig> . in the alkaline-treated stem sections, where esterified acetyl residues were removed, the signal was strongly visible in all samples, and the signal strength was the same for the transgenic and wt plants. acetylation is known to restrict the binding of ux <dig> to glca residues  <cit> . no signal was detected in either the water- or alkaline-treated gux1gux <dig> sections . the water- and alkaline-treated sections were labeled with the xylan-specific ax <dig> antibody  <cit> , indicating that xylan was present and accessible to the antibodies in all samples. the disappearance of ux <dig> labeling in the water-treated scagu <dig> shows that all ux1-accessible glca residues, which are present in small amounts in the wt and most likely are situated in the regions of xylan that are not acetylated, were cleaved in the transgenic lines.figure  <dig> immunolabeling of the basal stem sections with ux <dig> and ax <dig> antibodies. the  <dig>  μm sections of wt , transgenic plants line  <dig>  and line  <dig> , and the glca-deficient mutant, gux1gux2

finally, to test if wall digestibility was affected by the removal of scagu <dig> accessible glca moieties, the main inflorescence stems of the transgenic  and wt plants were subjected to hot water or  <dig>  m naoh pretreatments, after which the stems were hydrolyzed with a mixture of commercial lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. there was no difference in the reducing sugars released from the stem tissues by the enzymes after any of these pretreatments , which shows that cell wall digestibility in the scagu <dig> transgenic plants did not change.

discussion
codon-optimized scagu <dig> α-glucuronidase was produced in an active form in arabidopsis without altering plant development. the recombinant enzyme showed activity against internal glca substitutions of non-acetylated aldopentaouronic acid. however, no decrease in the glca content or improved digestibility of the stem tissues was observed despite the high reactivity of scagu <dig> towards the non-acetylated hardwood xylan polymer in vitro has been detected  <cit> . the lack of quantitatively detectable change in the glca content  or glca substituted xylp units  in the xylans of scagu <dig> expressing lines compared to the wild type indicates that the action of this enzyme is limited in planta. therefore, it appears that reducing the glca content by mutating the endogenous glcats, gux <dig> and gux <dig>  is more efficient than post-synthetic modification with an exogenous gh <dig> α-glucuronidase. interestingly, gux1gux <dig> showed, in addition to a significantly reduced glca content, an elevated amount of xylan and mannan as indicated by the increased xyl and man content . the increase in xyl levels in gux1gux <dig> was similarly observed by  <cit> . this may suggest a competing utilization of udp-glca in the double mutant as the substrate for udp-glca decarboxylase to produce udp-xyl  <cit> .

the unchanged levels of glca, in spite of active agu <dig> being expressed in the apoplast, are most likely caused by the acetylation in native gx. arabidopsis gx is known to be highly acetylated. as many as 50% of the xyl residues are either mono- or di-acetylated  <cit> . furthermore, of the glca-substituted xyl residues, only 23% are non-acetylated whereas 77% carry acetylation at the 3-o position  <cit> . moreover, the pattern of acetylation is rather uniform along the gx chain. most acetyl groups are located in every other xyl residue  <cit> , and occasionally, on two adjacent xyl residues  <cit> . therefore the sites where the acetyl groups are absent in several adjacent residues are probably very scarce. since the presence of acetylation changes the hydrophobicity of xylans by replacing the hydroxyl group with the more hydrophobic acetyl, dense acetylation would expectedly affect the enzyme-substrate binding. in gh <dig> active sites, in addition to the important + <dig> subsite, the neighboring xyl residues at the reducing end side   and the nonreducing end side  of the xylan chain may be crucial for productive enzyme-substrate binding, especially since the enzyme is active on the internal meglca substitutions  <cit> . thus, despite their small size, the acetyl residues linked at or close to the glca substituted xyl may interfere with productive substrate binding. the hindering effect of acetyl substitution on scagu <dig> action has been shown in vitro since only 10% of the theoretical meglca was released from birch acgx compared to the 49% yield from deacetylated gx  <cit> . thus, xylan acetylation is expectedly the key parameter restricting the action of gh <dig> enzymes in native cell walls. further work is needed to test the activity of this family of α-glucuronidases using model substrates with well-defined acetylation patterns.

the proposed shielding of glca substituents by acetylation is consistent with the immunolocalization results for the ux <dig> antibody . a small but clear difference between the transgenic and wt plants in ux <dig> antibody binding to native cell walls, and no difference in ux <dig> binding after cell wall deacetylation was observed. thus, the ux <dig> antibody marks the scagu <dig> accessible epitodes on native acgx, which is known to be very low abundant in arabidopsis  <cit> . although we did not detect a change in the content of the non-acetylated glca substituted xyl in the dmso-solubilized acgx of transgenic plants with hsqc nmr, the signal from these residues in the wt was very low . moreover, the method extracts only ca. 20% xylan  <cit> . therefore, we propose that the ux <dig> labeling provided a more sensitive detection of the rare scagu <dig> accessible sites, revealing the action of this enzyme in planta .

the in planta modification of glca is, nonetheless, an attractive approach for better extractability of xylans as has been demonstrated with gux1gux <dig>  <cit> . however, the structural heterogeneity of acgx may not permit a single hydrolytic enzyme to work effectively. if the in planta modification of glca content by gh <dig> α-glucuronidase is hindered by xylan acetylation, a viable approach could be co-expression with an acetyl xylan esterase  to obtain synergism between these side-group removing enzymes. production of the carbohydrate esterase  family  <dig> axe in plants has been attempted, and the transgenic plants showed, similarly as with scagu <dig>  no visible morphological changes and no effect on saccharification  <cit> . no improvement in saccharification was observed in gux1gux <dig> hydrolyzed without pretreatment  <cit> , even though the extractability of xylan was improved  <cit> , which shows that a strong decrease in glca substitution by mutating endogenous glcats might not be optimal for biomass improvement for saccharification. therefore, the co-expression of agu <dig> and axe in plants could be a strategic approach for designing a wall amenable to better xylan extractability and saccharification.

nonetheless, the resistance of acgx to scagu <dig> in planta, combined with the lack of adverse effects of the transgene on plants, opens up the possibility of using such transgenic plants to produce the active enzyme for biotechnological applications. for example, a thermostable variant expressed in biofuel feedstocks could be envisaged for removing hemicellulose more efficiently during pretreatment and for reducing enzyme loads during enzymatic hydrolysis. thermostable xylanases have been engineered and expressed in plants, but these enzymes were also active in ambient conditions in planta  <cit> . to our knowledge, the scagu <dig> is the first enzyme that does not appreciably change the cell wall in planta while exhibiting normal activity when extracted.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, active gh <dig> α-glucuronidase from schizophyllum commune was produced for the first time in plants. the scagu <dig> expressing arabidopsis thaliana were viable and no morphological changes were observed. however, only low amount of cell wall glca substituents, which were recognized by anti-ux labeling of native xylans, was removed by the active enzyme. moreover, the scagu <dig> expression did not improve the saccharification efficiency of the transgenic plants. the limited action of scagu <dig> in planta is envisaged to be due to shielding effects of acetyl substituents on xylans. therefore, co-expressing the gh <dig> α-glucuronidase with an acetyl xylan esterase can be a strategic approach to modify the side groups of cell wall xylans.
