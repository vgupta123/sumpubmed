BACKGROUND
c <dig> photosynthesis evolved repeatedly from c <dig> photosynthesis in at least  <dig> different lineages of angiosperms  <cit> . many of these evolutionary transitions are coincident with the decline of atmospheric co <dig> concentration in the oligocene  <cit> . because of the c <dig> photosynthetic pathway, c <dig> plants are able to concentrate co <dig> into the bundle sheath cells  where rubisco  is localized  <cit> . this substantially reduces the inhibitory process of photorespiration and thus increases light, water and nitrogen use efficiencies in c <dig> relative to c <dig> plants  <cit> . since its discovery in the 1960’s, there has been much interest in understanding how c <dig> plants evolved  <cit> . in addition to being scientifically intriguing, a thorough understanding of the evolutionary process of c <dig> photosynthesis will also help guide efforts to engineer c <dig> traits into c <dig> plants and boost crop yield and resource use efficiencies  <cit> . in recent years, the incorporation of phylogenetic methods into c <dig> studies has greatly aided the evaluation of evolutionary hypothesis concerning when, where and how the c <dig> pathway evolved  <cit> . genera that include both c <dig> species and c <dig> species, as well as species with intermediate phenotypes between c <dig> and c <dig>  such as flaveria  <cit>  and heliotropium  <cit> , have been of particular interest for the study of the evolution of c <dig> photosynthesis. intermediate species have features of both c <dig> and c <dig> photosynthetic pathways  <cit>  and often differ from c <dig> species by possessing characteristics of c <dig> plants such as enhanced c <dig> enzyme expression and activity  <cit> . a concern has been whether the intermediate species branch in sister positions to c <dig> and c <dig> clades that would support a conclusion of shared ancestry and thus that the intermediate reflects an evolutionary transitional state  <cit> , however, resolving the phylogenetic positions of intermediates often requires a data-rich phylogeny  <cit> .

because it has multiple c <dig> and c <dig> species, more known c3-c <dig> intermediate species than any other genera, and is relatively young , the genus flaveria has become the main model system for the study of c <dig> evolution in the eudicots  <cit> . for over 30 years, researches with flaveria species have examined the structural, physiological, biochemical and molecular variation in their leaves and genomes . collectively, these studies led to the proposal that c <dig> characters are acquired in a step-wise manner during the evolution of c <dig> photosynthesis, and recently, the rise of c <dig> character states in flaveria were proposed to follow a progressive, mount fuji adaptive landscape model  <cit> . in support of this step-wise transition, a comparative study of the localization of p-protein of glycine decarboxylase  into different photosynthetic types of flaveria showed that the restriction of gldp to bsc occurs gradually in going from pure c <dig> to intermediate species and then to c <dig> species  <cit> .

an important development in the understanding of c <dig> evolution in flaveria has been the publication of a well-resolved phylogenetic tree of the genus and sister taxa  <cit> . the first phylogeny of flaveria was published using morphological markers by powell  <cit> . this was followed by a single gene tree by kopriva et al., based on the h-protein of glycine decarboxylase  <cit> . while both trees were limited by relatively small data sets on which to infer relationships, they did indicate two major clades are present in flaveria, with each containing c3-c <dig> intermediate species and c <dig> or c4-like species in distal positions of each clade  <cit> . this suggests the possibility of two independent origins of the c <dig> pathway in flaveria.

the most widely accepted phylogenetic tree of flaveria was constructed using three non-coding dna sequences  combined with a number of morphological features, such as life history, leaf surface properties and capitulescence and so on  <cit> . the inclusion of the morphological characters resulted in a composite tree that is widely used to infer flaveria relationships in order to test hypotheses of evolutionary origin using physiological, biochemical or molecular data sets  <cit> . however phylogenies based on non-coding regions and/or loci under selection can also potentially provide different interpretations due to varying selection pressures, demography, and selection sweeps  <cit> . moreover, phylogenetic trees inferred from different non-coding sequences have been shown to be incongruent with each other in numerous taxa such as the gramineae  <cit> . it has also been shown that phylogenetic trees inferred from morphological data often conflict with trees inferred from molecular sequence data  <cit> . considering the increasing interest in precisely mapping out the evolutionary steps for c <dig> photosynthesis and the importance of the flaveria genus in studying c <dig> evolution, it is pertinent to re-evaluate the phylogeny of flaveria using the information-rich data based on molecular sequences that has recently become available  <cit> .

with the advent of low-cost sequencing technologies, there has been a rapid accumulation of molecular sequence data for non-model species, such as flaveria. those algorithms that utilize such sequence data to construct phylogenetic trees have been recently developed . for example, using data matrix constructed based on assembled contigs from rna-seq reads, a robust phylogeny of  <dig> mosquito species was constructed  <cit> . the phylogeny of  <dig> lice  was re-constructed by combing est data and genomic dna-seq data  <cit> , and the phylogeny of  <dig> species from class actinopterygii were generated using different sources of data, including public genome sequences, est, mrna, transcriptome as well as cdna and unigenes  <cit> .

in this work, we present a new method to use rna-seq data to generate phylogenetic trees, and then use it to reconstruct the phylogeny of flaveria. first, we extracted phylogentically informative sites from rna-seq data by directly mapping sequence reads to coding sequences  of a fully sequenced reference species . using this data set, we generated a phylogenetic tree of  <dig> flaveria species, including representatives of c <dig>  c3-c <dig> intermediate, c4-like and c <dig> species. the resulting tree is largely consistent with the most widely referenced flaveria phylogeny  <cit>  but with slight modifications. using our mapping strategy we provide evidence that a “f. pringlei” accession used in this and many prior studies is a hybrid derived from a pure parent of f. pringlei  and a f. angustifolia  parent.

RESULTS

to construct a phylogenetic tree of the genus flaveria, we obtained illumina rna-seq data from  <dig> flaveria species  and  <dig> out-group species from the asteraceae . in total there were  <dig> rna-seq samples including  <dig> flaveria samples and  <dig> samples of out-group species. the  <dig> rna-seq samples were obtained from two sources. nineteen samples were obtained from the one thousand plants  consortium  which were grown in the university of toronto and  <dig> samples were obtained from heinrich-heine university  . on average, each flaveria rna-seq sample from the 1kp consortium and hhu provided around  <dig>  million  and  <dig>  million  raw reads respectively . in summary, the  <dig> rna-seq datasets of  <dig> flaveria species covered plants grown in greenhouses at hhu  and the university of toronto , and included six species with both samples from juvenile leaves and mature leaves, besides, the datasets were from two different sequencing protocols, i.e. pair-end reads  and single-end reads  using illumina sequencing .table  <dig> rna-seq data and cross mapping result

mapping reads to minimal coding sequence set of arabidopsis thaliana
the estimated divergence time between flaveria and a. thaliana is ~ <dig> million years   <cit> . the long divergence time and hence different evolutionary histories may result in gene family expansion through duplications and thus influence correct reads mapping. in order to reduce the potential artifacts from reads cross-mapping caused by paralogs, a minimal reference coding sequences  of a. thaliana was used as mapping template . the m-cds contained  <dig>  coding sequences  that was constructed by removing redundant paralogs. during cross-species mapping of rna-seq reads to m-cds, we mapped reads in protein-space using blat and only retained mapped reads with an estimated false positive discovery rate  below 1 % . all samples have similar percentages of reads mapping to the m-cds: 40 %–45 % of reads from the 1kp consortium samples can be mapped to m-cds reference, and 43 % ~ 56 % of reads from hhu samples can be mapped to the reference . thus, around 50 % of the total number of reads from all samples was used in this study. to further estimate the accuracy of cross species mapping, we used the information from paired reads to determine the percentage of reads that mapped in concordant pairs to the same gene. on average, 68 % of all mapped reads mapped in pairs, of which 99 % mapped concordantly to the same reference, suggesting a high reliability of cross species mapping.

cross-species cds sequence extrapolation
having selected the high quality mapped reads, we then used them to infer the consensus cds sequence of each orthologous gene from m-cds in each species. the inferred nucleotide sequence at each site was estimated based on the number of mapped reads and the frequency of occurrence of each nucleotide at each site . all sites were classified into one of  <dig> discrete categories : 1) consensus sites , encoded in ; 2) ambiguous sites , encoded in  and 3) uncovered site , encoded in gap character “-”. we then estimated the consistency of cs sites across independent leaf rna-seq datasets from the same species. among six species with both juvenile and mature leaf rna-seq datasets from 1kp consortium, the highest consistency was found in f. bidentis, with entire predicted cs sites from mature leaf samples being identical to the corresponding cs sites from juvenile leaf.  <dig>  % of cs sites from f. trinervia were identical between juvenile and mature leaf. f. angustifolia, which had the lowest consistency, still showed  <dig>  % of predicted cs sites being equivalent between two types of leaf libraries . finally, the cs data matrix was built by concatenating cs sites that were shared in all samples .fig.  <dig> the workflow for data matrix construction. a–e: the workflow for obtaining data matrix. a: the coding sequence  of a. thaliana was used as template for mapping. rna-seq reads were translated into amino acid sequences and mapped to the template using blat in protein space; b: continuously mapped reads were retained after passing minimal blat mapping score , and exact read-mapped regions on the template were then extracted. c: ucs, cs and as were determined by calculating the nucleotide frequency at each site based on the mapping result ; d: the codons were extracted from cs using sliding windows. e: linking retained codons for each cds, cs data matrix was then built by concatenating retained codons from all cds for ml method. 



the cs based phylogenetic inference method recapitulates previously published phylogenies
next, we examined whether cs based phylogenetic inference method can recapitulate previously published phylogenies. here, we applied our method to the publicly available rna-seq data of  <dig> mosquito species from the genus aedes and the genus anopheles in hittinger et al.  <cit> . the reference cds of aedes aegypti were used as mapping template. this dataset was selected because the divergence time between the genus aedes and the genus anopheles is ~ <dig>  mya  <cit> , which is comparable to the evolutionary time between a. thaliana and flaveria. we obtained a data matrix comprising  <dig>  cs spanning  <dig>  genes in each species . both maximum likelihood  and bayesian-inference  were used to infer the phylogeny of the  <dig> mosquito species and the result showed that the bipartitions of the resulting ml and bi phylogenies were identical and both were the same as the published tree .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of ten mosquito species. a: phylogeny of  <dig> mosquito species constructed using our strategy. both bayesian inference  tree and maximum likelihood  tree were inferred from  <dig>  genes with  <dig>  sites with gtr + gamma + i model of sequence substitution and variation. the number besides each node was posterior probability inferred from  <dig> , <dig> generations/bootstrap score from  <dig> bootstrap sampling. b: phylogeny of  <dig> mosquito species using ml method in hittinger et al. 



constructed tree of individual samples of  <dig> flaveria species based on m-cds
having demonstrated that the cs based phylogenetic inference method can recapitulate a published phylogeny in mosquito species with a well-described phylogeny, we then applied our method to rna-seq data from  <dig> individual samples of  <dig> flaveria species. we obtained a cs data matrix comprising  <dig>  cs sites from  <dig>  genes . bi tree and ml tree based on the cs data matrix had the same topology and showed the basal branching species were c <dig> and later branching species comprise the intermediates and c <dig> species , which was consistent with the tree in  <cit> . in addition, there were also two obvious clades in our tree, only one of which contained the c <dig>  however, compared with the tree in  <cit> , our new tree showed a large shift in the position of f. angustifolia. the tree in  <cit>  supported that f. angustifolia derived after the emergence of two clades which was supported by bootstrap score of  <dig> and bayesian posterior probability of  <dig>  however, in our tree, it is predicted to have diverged before the appearance of the two distinct clades which was supported by bootstrap score of  <dig> and bayesian posterior probability of  <dig> 

the f. pringlei used in this study is likely a hybrid between f. pringlei and f. angustifolia
it has previously been reported that f. pringlei  and f. angustifolia  can hybridize  <cit> . in consistent with this, they branch as sister taxa in our tree, and importantly, f. pringlei from both hhu and 1kp consortium were sister taxa in the tree based on individual flaveria samples . therefore, it is possible that both samples of f. pringlei grown by hhu and university of toronto teams may be from hybrid seeds of true f. pringlei and f. angustifolia. to assess this possibility, we defined  <dig> c <dig> and c3-c <dig> marker sites from  <dig> genes based on the pooled leaf samples . out of these  <dig> sites, f. pringlei showed  <dig>  % being c <dig> marker and  <dig>  % being c3-c <dig> marker, and 38 % being hybrid site dominant by either c <dig> marker  or c3-c <dig> marker  , indicating f. pringlei expressed genes both from c <dig> and c3-c <dig> species. in contrast, in f. angustifolia,  <dig>  % of sites were c3-c <dig> marker, which suggested that f. angustifolia belong to the c3-c <dig> species . similarly, by only analyzing f. pringlei sample from hhu, we found 70 % of marker sites have mapped reads being c <dig> and c3-c <dig> marker sites with a ratio close to be 1: <dig> . thus, our result suggested a high possibility of f. pringlei used by hhu was derived from a hybrid of true f. pringlei and f. angustifolia. therefore, we termed f. pringlei in this study as f. pri × f. ang. to eliminate any potential influence on phylogeny construction caused by f. pri × f. ang, we reconstructed phylogenetic tree without the f. pri × f. ang samples.table  <dig> the percentage of sites with a c <dig> origin, or c3-c <dig> origin in f. pri × f. ang, f. angustifolia and f. sonorensis

constructed tree of  <dig> flaveria species based on m-cds
based on the  <dig> rna-seq samples from  <dig> flaveria species, we obtained a cs matrix comprising  <dig>  cs sites from  <dig>  genes . both the bi method and ml method were applied to infer the phylogeny based on cs matrix and the two methods generated exactly the same tree topology . the tree excluding f. pri × f. ang was largely congruent with the tree including f. pri × f. ang  but presented two alternative branching possibilities: the taxon of f. sonorensis  was exchanged with the taxon of f. angustifolia , and the taxon of f. robusta  was exchanged with the taxon of f. cronquistii  . the resulting topology was consistent with the topology in mckown’s tree  <cit> , where f. cronquistii was the basal-branching taxon in flaveria, and f. sonorensis emerged earlier than f. angustifolia. therefore, we suggested a “dragging-to-root” effect on the position of f. angustifolia was caused by f. pri × f. ang in the tree containing f. pri × f. ang . notably, individual samples from different libraries of a species, such as samples from different tissues, different development stages, and different labs, were placed as the closet sister taxa , suggesting that our method can be applied for rna-seq of plant samples from different sources or different sequencing protocols.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of individual flaveria samples based on m-cds. to remove the effect of f. pri × f. ang on phylogenetic relationships among other species, the phylogenetic tree was constructed without f. pri × f. ang. the m-cds of a. thaliana was used as mapping reference to construct consensus sequence  matrix according to fig.  <dig>  a cs matrix with  <dig>  sites from  <dig>  genes was used to infer phylogenetic relationships based on both bayesian inference  and maximum likelihood  using gtr + gamma + i model of sequence substitution and variation. bi tree and ml tree showed consistent topology. the numbers besides each node were posterior probability inferred from  <dig>  generations  and bootstrap score  from  <dig> bootstrap sampling. 



we found that some of the branches in the tree of fig.  <dig> had low ml scores, e.g. the branch containing f. brownii and f. floridana , and the branch containing f. bidentis, f. trinervia and f. australasica . given that trees inferred from the cs data matrix are independent of developmental stages, tissues, rna-sequencing protocols, and growth conditions, we pooled all cs sites for the same species to increase the quantity of input data for phylogenetic tree construction. this pooling can potentially help resolve phylogenetic relationships for taxa of recent emergence. the pooled dataset comprised  <dig> species, including  <dig> flaveria species and  <dig> out-group species together with a. thaliana, and the corresponding cs data matrix comprised  <dig>  cs sites from  <dig>  genes. as before, both ml and bi methods were used to infer the phylogeny using the cs data matrix . the two approaches yielded identical tree topologies . importantly, the tree based on pooled samples  was the same as the tree based on individual samples . however, the bootstrap scores of this pooled-sample tree were on average higher than that of the tree based on individual samples, especially at the nodes that were supported by low bootstrap scores. for example, the branch containing f. floridana and f. brownii was supported by bootstrap score of  <dig> in the individual-sample tree, but supported by a  <dig> bootstrap value in the pooled-sample tree.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of  <dig> flaveria species using m-cds. pooled rna-seq reads of  <dig> flaveria species were mapped to m-cds of a. thaliana, consensus sequence matric was then built according to method shown in fig.  <dig>  both bayesian inference  tree and maximum likelihood  tree were inferred from  <dig>   <dig> genes with  <dig>  sites with gtr + gamma + i model of sequence substitution and variation. the numbers besides each node were posterior probability  inferred from  <dig>  generations and bootstrap score  from  <dig> bootstrap sampling. the numbers in brackets were relative branch length estimated from bayesian. 



it has been demonstrated previously that evolutionary rates may differ between single-copy and duplicated genes  <cit> . to determine whether this influenced our phylogeny, we created the singleton reference cds  dataset by removing all genes that have duplicates in a. thaliana from the m-cds dataset . the cs data matrix based on s-cds containing  <dig>  cs from  <dig>  genes was then used to infer a phylogenetic tree of  <dig> flaveria species by applying the same methods mentioned above . the results showed that, the topology of the phylogenetic tree of  <dig> flaveria species based on s-cds  was identical to that based on m-cds . but the tree based on s-cds was supported by lower bootstrap scores, especially for those nodes that were supported by low bootstrap score in m-cds. our results indicate that multiple paralogs do not have a major effect on phylogeny outcomes based on rna-seq data.

it has been repeatedly demonstrated that 3rd codon positions have different rates of evolution from those of the 1st and 2nd codon positions  <cit> . to estimate the effect of different codon position on the phylogenetic tree, we constructed separate phylogenetic trees using three codon positions independently . results showed that the trees based on the three independent codon positions and the entire codons were largely congruent with each other in most taxa; the major difference was observed in the positions of f. bidentis and f. angustifolia. specifically, compared with trees based on the 2nd  and 3rd codon positions  as well as the entire codons , the tree based on the 1st codon position  placed f. bidentis at the base of f. kochiana and f. vaginata but with a low bootstrap score of  <dig>  the tree based on the 2nd codon position, however, placed f. angustifolia at the base of clade a with a low bootstrap score of  <dig>  importantly, the topology of the phylogenetic tree inferred from the 3rd codon position  was identical to that based on entire codons . this indicated that for the genus flaveria, the strongest phylogenetic signal is derived from the 3rd codon position. we postulate that the short divergent time among flaveria species  make the third codon position, which is most variable, a preferred choice in resolving the phylogenetic relationships according to  <cit> . this finding is consistent with previous reports that the 3rd position of codons contains the stronger phylogenetic signal  <cit> . in this regard, it is also worth mentioning that some reports  <cit>  suggested that the 3rd position of codons can also potentially bias the construction of phylogenetic trees.

discussion
a new approach to construct phylogenetic trees using rna-seq data
phylogenetic analyses are essential for interpreting species relationships and evolutionary transitions within lineages, in particular, the origin of complex traits such as c <dig> photosynthesis. the advances of the next generation sequencing technologies are rapidly decreasing the cost of both transcritpome and whole genome sequencing. in this study, we exploited a novel method to use transcriptome data for phylogenetic inference. compared to genome sequencing, rna-seq is much cheaper and is enriched in the genetic sequences that commonly form the basis of phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . moreover, rna-seq is biased towards highly expressed genes, which are likely to have housekeeping and energy metabolism functions  <cit>  and thus be conserved across species  <cit> . therefore, rna-seq has been proposed as rich data in constructing construct phylogenetic trees to study evolutionary questions for living species  <cit> .

in prior studies that have used rna-seq to infer phylogenetic trees, a common first step has been to assemble short reads to generate sequence contigs, and then to map these contigs onto reference transcripts . we used an alternative approach where we directly mapped rna-seq reads to the reference coding sequences  of the model species arabidopsis thaliana . this new method has a number of advantages:  it directly uses rna-seq reads for multiple sequence alignments in a single step and thus is suitable for scaling to a large number of species,  it bypasses the process of assembling short reads into contigs, thus saving computational resources and time,  it avoids potential errors caused by assembly, for example, misassembly or gene fusion, and  it avoids generating multiple sequence alignments and the potential errors introduced by this step. although utr and intronic regions are very useful in studying evolution, our method excludes such information because they are less conserved across species and therefore have less chance to be retained in data matrix after mapping short reads to cds. our method enables us to detect whether a sample is from a plant formed by hybridization of two other species, which is hard to assess using morphological data or a limited number of gene loci. this is crucial because samples from hybrid species may substantially influence the accuracy of a phylogeny. one drawback of our method is that orfs may not be the same in flaveria and in a. thaliana. to overcome this issue, we discarded genes with less than  <dig> % of the cds region being covered by cs sites.

though rna-seq based approaches are shown to be effective, for now, pcr-based and est-based methods are still preferred initial methods for resolving phylogenetic relationships, due to their relative ease and cost. rna-seq methods can serve as valuable alternatives when the phylogenetic relationship cannot be solved using traditional methods due to inadequate informative sites or short divergence time between species, or when it is hard to design pcr probes for species with little genomic information. furthermore, our cs based phylogenetic inference approach can use samples from different tissues, living conditions, developmental stages, and sequencing protocols . one potential caveat is that alternative splicing specific to some tissues may result in a different cs data matrix. our results indicate that phylogenetic relationships of  <dig> flaveria species were equivalent between the tree based on samples from different tissues  and the tree derived from samples from only leaves . therefore, the effect of alternative splicing has relatively minor impacts on the construction of the phylogenetic tree using our method.

multiple paralogs are a potential source of error in using rna-seq data to generate phylogenetic tree during the process of aligning reads to a reference. in this study, we devised strategies to avoid ambiguous results caused by paralogs. specifically, we used two different references for reads mapping. the first reference used the longest gene for each paralog family  in a. thaliana, and a separate reference used genes that have no paralogs in a. thaliana . using s-cds references effectively remove cross mapping problems although at a cost of reduced numbers of informative sites. the procedure of consensus sequence  construction further eliminated the influence of cross mapping reads because we accepted one site being a cs only if this site exists in at least  <dig> reads, of which 80 % contains the same nucleotide. as a result, reads from paralogs, especially those with large sequence differences from the ancestor genes, should not contribute to the cs. the equivalent topology between the phylogenetic tree based on m-cds and that based on s-cds indicates that multiple paralogs have no effect on the topology rna-seq based phylogenies in the flaveria case.

an updated phylogeny of the genus flaveria
the updated tree  from this study is largely consistent with the previously published tree  <cit> . our new tree also shows two distinct clades in flaveria . our tree also indicates c <dig> species branch in a basal position to intermediate and c <dig> species, thus supporting hypotheses that c <dig> photosynthesis is the ancestral condition in flaveria  <cit> . one difference between the rns-seq tree and the tree in  <cit>  is the position of f. angustifolia. in the previous published tree  <cit> , f. angustifolia is placed at the root of clade b with a bootstrap score of  <dig>  and bayesian posterior probability of  <dig> . however, in our trees, f. angustifolia resides in the root position for both clade a and clade b , and this modification is consistent with the same number of layers  of leaf ground tissue observed inf. angustifolia and two c <dig> species: f. cronquistii and f. robusta  <cit> . another difference is the place of f. chloraefolia in clade b, which was placed near the root of clade b branching above f. anomala  in  <cit> , however, the branch of f. chloraefolia was exchanged with the branch of f. pubescens  in our tree. it is interesting to note that many of the ml bootstrap scores in the currently accepted tree for clade b are less than  <dig> in  <cit> . in contrast, in the updated tree, nodes in clade b have more reliable ml scores, with the lowest ml score being  <dig> . our tree agrees with  <cit>  in the placement of the f. ramosissima branch in clade a, however, the branches containing f. kochiana and f. vaginanta were exchanged with the branch containing f. australasica and f. trinervia.

the main reason for these differences between the rna-seq tree  and the mckpwon et al. tree  <cit>  is likely due to different number of informative sites available for two methods. the informative sites used in  <cit>  may be insufficient, which resulted in lower supports based on ml or bi at some nodes, especially for nodes in clade b. as a result, the phylogenetic positions of f. brownii, f. linearis  and f. pubescens, f. oppositifolia, f. floridana were not resolved because of low ml and bi supports.

implications for c <dig> evolution and engineering efforts based on the updated flaveria phylogenetic tree
the phylogenetic tree of the  <dig> flaveria species suggested several features of c <dig> evolution . first, clade a of the tree strongly supports hypotheses of step-wise evolution from c <dig> towards c <dig>  which has been proposed based on morphological traits and physiological traits  <cit> . the progress from c <dig> to c <dig> photosynthesis in this clade started with a c3-c <dig> intermediate photosynthesis type in f. ramosissima and then to a c4-like photosynthesis type in f. palmeri  <cit> . secondly, we found two parallel c <dig> sub-clades: the sub-clade containing f. kochiana and f. vaginata and the sub-clade containing f. bidentis, f. trinervia, and f. australasica. this repositioning presented two equally possible scenarios 1) that there was a single origin of c <dig> photosynthesis with a reacquisition of weak c <dig> activity in mesophyll cells in f. vaginata  <cit> , or 2) that c <dig> has arisen twice within this clade. both hypotheses invoked two transitions and thus are equally likely  <cit> . thirdly, clade b contained only intermediate species, i.e.  <dig> c3-c <dig> species and one c4-like species, f. brownii, which shows comparable c4-like leaf anatomy and physiological traits as the f. palmeri  <cit>  in the clade a, suggesting that c <dig> traits can be recruited from multiple trajectories  <cit> . such multiple trajectories towards c <dig> photosynthesis have also been previously proposed from phenotypic landscape inference  <cit> .

cross fertilization in the genus flaveria
our results suggested that the f. pringlei  from both hhu and university of toronto are hybrids from pure parents of a f. pringlei and a f. angustifolia . this could have happened either naturally in the field, or in cultivation in a greenhouse environment  <cit> . in addition to f. pringlei and f. angustifolia, many other flaveria species are able to cross-fertilize, as have been summarized in powell  <cit> . therefore, it is important to check whether flaveria samples are indeed pure species during experiments. considering that none of the flaveria genomes has been sequenced so far, comparing rna-seq reads with marker sites of defined photosynthetic types coupled with constructing a phylogeny using cs based phylogenetic inference approach provide a strategy to distinguish the hybridized or mixed samples from pure samples.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed a new procedure to obtain abundant phylogenetic data for generating phylogenetic trees in non-model species. using this approach, we constructed a robust phylogeny of  <dig> flaveria species, which were largely congruent with previous public trees although the positions of some species were modified. these modifications are supported with high branch-supports. we showed that samples of f. pringlei  used in a number of labs are hybrids of original f. pringlei  and f. angustifolia . we propose that the new strategy on obtaining phylogenetic informative sequence from this study can be used to study phylogeny for a larger number of taxa.
