BACKGROUND
excitotoxicity is linked to many disease states, the consequences of which are thought to be critical to the pathogenic process  <cit> . kainic acid , a glutamate receptor agonist is frequently used to model such insults both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . excitotoxicity induced by ka initiates a cascade of events at multiple levels, including neuronal death, transcriptional changes in ion channels and altered synaptic plasticity  <cit> . the ultimate pathogenic outcome of an excitotoxic insult is likely to be reflected in changes in neuronal network activity. identifying changes in network properties is therefore important to our overall understanding of underlying pathogenesis caused by excitotoxcity.

the hippocampal slice preparation is widely used to investigate the cellular and synaptic mechanisms that underlie synchronized network events. in isolated hippocampal slices, network firing is initiated in the ca <dig> region and propagates along the output pathway of the schaffer collaterals to the ca <dig> region where it synchronizes neuronal firing, although ca1-led bursts have been reported  <cit> . cells within each sub region of the hippocampus are highly heterogeneous and respond quite distinctly to a ka insult. changes in the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels  that mediate a mixed cationic conductance  showcase this well. heterogeneous changes in subtype and extent of hcn mrna are evident in in vivo  <cit>  and in vitro  <cit>  ka models. these changes occur within  <dig> hours and are likely to impact on network activity in a regional specific manner. ka-mediated changes are unlikely to be limited to hcn, with transcriptional changes in other proteins and structural changes  also able to impact on measures of hippocampal excitability  <cit> . furthermore, alteration in network properties in one subregion are known to modulate network activity in connecting regions  <cit> . synchronized network firing is an encompassing parameter that integrates these various plastic changes.

in this paper, we investigate the impact of ka-mediated excitotoxicity on synchronized network firing in an in vitro model. within  <dig> hours following a ka insult the hippocampal slice cultures were essentially unable to generate synchronized neuronal firing in ca <dig> but recovered this ability by  <dig> days. simultaneously, slice cultures showed an increase in synchronized burst firing in ca <dig> consistent with a hyperexcitable phenotype. this excitability persisted over time. two distinct mechanisms drive different aspects of the increased propensity to synchronized burst firing in ca <dig>  namely a loss of the 'extrinsic' modulation by the ca <dig> affects burst timing, and an 'intrinsic' change limited to the ca <dig> sub region affects burst duration.

RESULTS
organotypic hippocampal slice cultures exhibit synchronous bursts led by ca3
synchronous discharges can be observed in mg2+-free acsf in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures  <cit> . the removal of mg2+ from the superfusate is thought to unblock nmda receptors, and the effect of mg2+ removal is largely reversed by nmda antagonists  <cit> . in the current study we monitored extracellular potentials in ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions before, and following, the addition of mg2+-free ascf to  <dig> day-old hippocampal cultures . during  <dig> min superfusion with normal acsf  no spontaneous burst activity was recorded from slices . after  <dig> –  <dig> min mg2+-free acsf superfusion the slice cultures exhibited a sharp increase in excitability characterized by rapid burst firing  before settling into a rhythmic firing pattern  that could be sustained for extended periods . previous studies have noted 'seizure-like events' or 'electrographic seizures' in hippocampal slice preparations progress through specific stages beginning as rapid burst firing and developing to rhythmic burst firing as described above  <cit> . in order to have consistency between recordings and slices measurements of burst parameters began  <dig> minutes after the onset of the rhythmic firing phase of events and continued for a minimum of  <dig> bursts, during which the parameters measured were relatively consistent. firing in both the ca <dig> and ca <dig> was highly synchronized. however, firing in the ca <dig> region consistently preceded that of the ca <dig> region by an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms  suggesting ca <dig> region generation, or pacing, of the firing in these cultures . the mean inter-burst interval  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s with a coefficient of variance , a measure of the regularity of timing of synchronized firing, of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , indicating the burst timing was quite consistent during the recording period, while the mean burst duration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s. the frequency of spikes within a burst was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz.

kainic acid  treatment dampens ca <dig> burst firing but increases ca <dig> excitability
to explore the impact of excitotoxicity on the ability to develop burst firing in both ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions of the hippocampus we treated the cultures with ka  for  <dig> hours. following this insult cultures were incubated in normal medium for at least  <dig> hours. extracellular recordings were made from ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions of treated cultures in mg2+-free acsf within  <dig> hours of termination of ka treatment  in order to examine early post-excitotoxic changes. a dramatic reduction in the ability of the ca <dig> region to generate burst firing was observed  <dig> hours after ka treatment . indeed, in  <dig> of  <dig> slices analyzed  synchronized firing was not evident in this region . in contrast, burst firing persisted in the ca <dig> region.

significant cell death does not account for a loss of ca <dig> burst firing at the  <dig> hour time-point following ka treatment
imaging of neun  labeled cultures revealed that the absence of ca <dig> activity was not due to loss of ca <dig> pyramidal cells at the  <dig> hour time-point . differences in the labeling of control and treated cultures were indiscernible with quantification showing no significant difference in neuronal cell count. neun-positive cell count in the pyramidal layer was  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  in the ca <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  in the ca <dig> . similarly, in the stratum lucidum/stratum radiatum of ca <dig> and stratum lacunosum-moleculare/stratum radiatum of ca <dig>  that predominantly consist of inhibitory interneurons  <cit> , neun-positive cell count was not affected by ka treatment:  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  in the ca <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  in the ca <dig> . further, cell counts  <dig> days after insult also showed no significant difference between treated and control age-matched cultures. cell death over time is expected in hippocampal slice cultures and the  <dig> day results reflect this. neu-n-positive pyramidal cell count was  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  in the ca <dig> , while stratum lucidium/stratum radiatum count was  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  . neu-n-positive pyramidal neurons in the ca <dig> was  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>   and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells/ <dig>  mm <dig>  in ca <dig> stratum lacunosum-moleculare/stratum radiatum . this data establishes that a loss of cells cannot account for the ablation of ca <dig> activity, as neurons are present at both time points with no significant difference between treated and untreated cultures.

increased ca <dig> excitability follows ka treatment
at the  <dig> hour time-point the ca <dig> region also showed a marked increase in the time spent in burst firing, due both to changes in the rate of occurrence and duration of burst events. the ibi of bursting present in ca <dig> region was significantly reduced after ka treatment from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s , indicating an increased rate of occurrence of synchronized bursts following the insult. the cvibi was unchanged at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s, suggesting that while the pacing of bursts is altered by ka, the control of the consistency of timing of synchronized firing was maintained in the ca <dig> region. the duration of bursts increased after ka treatment from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s . the frequency of spikes within a burst was not different from control . these results suggest that while ka-induced changes resulted in dramatic dampening of excitability in the ca <dig>  a paradoxical excitatory effect was evident in the ca <dig> region. we next asked if the increase in ca <dig> region excitability following the ka insult was a result of removal of the modulatory input from ca <dig> or a change in the intrinsic neuronal firing properties limited to the ca <dig> region.

separation of ca <dig> increases the rate of occurrence of burst firing in the ca <dig> region without changing burst duration
our results, and those of several other studies, indicated that under normal conditions burst firing in isolated hippocampal slice is paced by the ca <dig> region. to test the impact of this pacing on ca <dig> excitability in slice cultures we surgically separated the ca <dig> region from the remaining hippocampal culture . previous studies in acute slice preparations have shown isolation of ca <dig> causes loss of burst activity  <cit> . here bursting in the ca <dig> region persisted, however lost synchronicity with ca <dig> region activity. furthermore, the events were more frequent , with a significantly reduced ibi  relative to both control  and to intact ka-treated slices . this increased rate of occurrence of bursts in the ca <dig> region following separation is consistent with, but greater in magnitude to, that observed following ka treatment. the cvibi was increased following deafferentation  compared to both control  and ka-treated slices . this suggests that under standard conditions burst firing can occur independently in the ca <dig> region, but the regularity of this activity is determined by the ca <dig> input. interestingly, in contrast to the increase seen following ka treatment, burst duration tended to decrease following deafferentation . this suggests that dampening of the ca <dig> region firing following ka treatment cannot explain this component of the increased ca <dig> region excitability.

increases in burst duration in the ca <dig> region following ka insult are maintained in segregated slices
the impact of ca <dig> segregation on ca <dig> region excitability was also investigated in slices treated with ka. the ibi of the separated ca <dig> region did not change  from that measured in intact ka-treated slices . comparison of this with the reduction in ibi in the ca <dig> region following separation of untreated slices , suggests that the reduced ibi of burst events following ka insult is most likely due to a reduction in pacing from the ca <dig> region.

in untreated cultures, ca <dig> burst duration tended to decrease when the ca <dig> was separated from the slice while in ka-treated cultures the duration of the bursts increased. intriguingly, in ka-treated slices where the ca <dig> was segregated, the increase in ca <dig> burst duration was maintained . therefore, increases in the burst duration post-ka treatment cannot be explained by removal of ca <dig> input. these results suggest that ka treatment alters the properties of neuronal firing within either the ca <dig> and/or dg regions of the hippocampal slice to increase burst duration.

dg segregation does not alter ca <dig> firing
the ability of the dg to display synchronized firing in mg2+-free acsf has been reported  <cit> . the significant reciprocal projections present in hippocampal slice cultures between ca <dig> and dg raise the possibility that changes in the intrinsic properties of the dg may modulate changes in ca <dig> burst duration  <cit> . to establish the relationship between ca <dig> and dg we recorded from both regions in ca3-deafferented slices. ca <dig> firing preceded the dg by an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms , indicating that in the absence of the ca <dig> region, ca <dig> paces synchronized firing. however, it remains possible that a reciprocal interplay between ca <dig> and dg could influence burst duration in ca <dig> region.

to test this we isolated ca <dig> from all other hippocampal regions immediately prior to recording mg2+-free induced synchronized firing. the ibi  and burst duration  of isolated ca <dig> regions developed activity that was no different to that of slices that still contained the dg. therefore, it is unlikely that dg influences the observed changes in ca <dig> excitability. this was confirmed by evaluation of the impact of ka treatment on isolated ca <dig> region firing . isolation of the ca <dig> region did not change the ibi . however, the increase in burst duration was maintained . it is also similar in duration to ca <dig> activity recorded from ca <dig> deafferentation slices  and whole slices  following ka treatment. therefore, increased ca <dig> excitability in this preparation is due to both a reduction in the 'extrinsic' pacing input from ca <dig>  and changes to 'intrinsic' properties limited to the ca <dig> sub-region  following a ka insult.

increases in ca <dig> region burst duration, but not rate of occurrence, are sustained for up to  <dig> days following ka insult
to examine whether the functional changes were chronically sustained following acute ka-treatment, we recorded extracellular field potentials in ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions  <dig> days after ka insult. the ability of ca <dig> region to generate firing under mg2+-free conditions had returned at this later time-point with burst amplitudes consistent with control cultures . the ibi at this time was not significantly different from that recorded in control, non-treated cultures of identical age . this result is consistent with the premise that a return of ca <dig> pacing function accounts for the normalization of the rate of occurrence of burst-firing events in ca <dig>  in contrast, the ka-induced increases in burst duration within the ca <dig> were maintained at this later time-point . the duration of bursts was not different for ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions in ka-treated slices.

to confirm the importance on ca <dig> input in pacing burst frequency we again separated the ca <dig> from the ca <dig> just prior to recording at this later time-point. following deafferentation we found ibi increased in both control to  and ka-treated slices . thus removal of ca <dig> input again resulted in a disruption in the timing of ibi. however, rather than the decrease seen early after ka insult, we now measured a significant increase in ibi over the intact slices. there remained no significant difference in ibi between treated and control slices . conversely, removal of ca <dig> input had no significant impact on the burst duration in ca <dig> of deafferented slices compared to their intact counterparts in control  or treated slices . the elevated burst duration following ka treatment was maintained regardless of ca <dig> deafferentation .

discussion
here we describe three primary findings. firstly, that a loss of ca <dig> pacing 'control' of ca <dig> can increase excitability in this region. although not an entirely new concept  <cit> , this is the first demonstration of such interplay between ca <dig> and ca <dig> under pathological conditions. secondly, that a chemical  rather than a surgical insult is capable of 'isolating' the ca <dig> region from ca <dig>  given that ka models excitotoxcity this result provide evidence of a novel hypothesis regarding the mechanisms underlying hippocampal epileptogenesis following an excitotoxic insult that needs further testing in other brain model systems. finally, that the different aspects of burst behaviour  can be modulated by distinct network factors.

increases in excitability of the ca <dig> region and hyperexcitable phenotypes
the properties of the ca <dig> region, including a propensity to bursting and abundant recurrent collaterals, make it an obvious choice for driving a hyperexcitable hippocampus  <cit> . however, hyperexcitability limited to the ca <dig> region is recognized  <cit> . an increase in ca <dig> pyramidal neuron axon sprouting occurs in ka- and pilocarpine-treated animals  <cit> . de novo recurrent excitatory connections established within the ca <dig> following an excitotoxic insult are postulated to contribute to a hyperexcitable hippocampus  <cit> . in this sense the organotypic culture models a hippocampus that has already formed these recurrent ca <dig> connections. the ka insult therefore may model a further insult under such hyperexcitable conditions, as may be expected in epilepsy cases of multiple and progressively worsening seizures. the sustained changes in burst duration we observe in this model could therefore contribute to overall hippocampal hyperexcitability. determining the molecular and/or structural basis of a sustained increase in burst duration is therefore important.

structurally, ka-treated organotypic slices have a greater extent of ca <dig> pyramidal neuron axon sprouting, a feature that could change the dynamics of synchronization  <cit> . however, increases in axon sprouting occur on relatively slow time scales, and as such, are unlikely to be responsible for changes noted at the  <dig> hour time-point. while we observe no cell death in our cultures, selective ca <dig> interneurons are particularly sensitive to the toxic effects of ka, potentially altering the excitation/inhibition balance to render the ca <dig> hyperexcitable  <cit> . ca <dig> pyramidal neurons make recurrent excitatory contacts with interneurons producing feedback inhibition, and a specific loss of this function, through either loss of interneurons or changes in the intrinsic properties of interneurons may prolong burst duration  <cit> . burst appear to be terminated by activity-dependent depression at recurrent excitatory synapses, and ibi is predicted to be primarily due to the period of recovery from synaptic depression  <cit> . however, an alternative proposition for the pacing of ibis is the slow build-up of excitation governed by ih  <cit> . as already noted, transcriptional changes in ion channel expression do occur on short time frames and could contribute to changes seen. two good candidates are alterations in ih and t-type ca2+ channels. increased ca <dig> neuronal bursting due to the de novo expression of ni2+-sensitive t-type ca2+ channels is associated with epilepsy in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy   <cit> . similarly, increased hcn channel function in ca <dig> pyramidal neurons of the febrile convulsive model of tle is predicted to enhance synchronized neuronal firing  <cit> .

what causes a transient decrease in ca <dig> excitability?
the basis of the transient absence of mg2+-free synchronized firing in the ca <dig> region remains to be determined. ka applied for longer periods to organotypic hippocampal slices do illicit a selective degeneration of ca <dig> pyramidal cells  <cit> , raising the possibility that rapid cell death may be responsible. however, ka insult had no effect on the count of pyramidal neurons, or stratum lucidium and stratum radiatum inhibitory interneurons at either the  <dig> hour or  <dig> day time-points in our study. this is consistent with previous studies that suggest that long-term,  rather than short-term,  ka exposure results in cell death in organotypic cultures at similar concentrations  <cit> . furthermore, a return of ca <dig> bursting activity occurs at  <dig> days suggesting that neurons required to develop synchronized firing are present at the  <dig> hour time-point, but are unable to do so. therefore, the acute reduction in burst activity is more likely to reflect a functional change in ca <dig> sub-region neurons rather than be a consequence of cell death . previous studies of acute ka application have identified a wide range of hippocampal alterations, including changes in gabaa and gabab receptor expression, matrix metalloproteinase activity, mossy fiber innervation, and expression of neuronal and glial glutamate transporters and ongoing neuronal degeneration  <cit>  or transcriptional changes as previously discussed  <cit> . interneurons play an essential role in neuronal network synchronization and disruption of their input is expected to alter ca <dig> burst activity  <cit> . loss of gabab receptor-mediated heterosynaptic depression in mossy fibres innervating the ca <dig>  postulated to contribute to maintenance of seizure activity, has also been reported  <dig> hours after pilocarpine exposure  <cit> . therefore changes to the intrinsic properties of excitatory or inhibitory neurons may contribute to the loss of activity in ca <dig> 

potential pathophysiological implications
in rats in vivo, ka-induced status epilepticus and its sequelae are widely used to model the development of tle  <cit> . in vitro, application of ka to organotypic slices results in many of the hallmarks of tle, including mossy fiber sprouting, eventual hippocampal neuronal death , and an enhanced propensity to synchronized neuronal firing  <cit> . our results suggest that in the hippocampus, ka-mediated excitotoxic stimuli cause changes in neuronal network firing patterns that are highly region-specific. paradoxically, reduced excitability in the ca <dig> region can enhance excitability in the ca <dig> region. conceptually, this provides a novel means by which hippocampal excitability can be increased. in this scheme an adaptive process, presumably attempting to limit hyperexcitability in the ca <dig>  engages or affects a mechanism resulting in an increased ca <dig> excitability. a similar mechanism has been proposed to unmask recurrent entorhinal seizures in intact hippocampal-entorhinal slices in which the shaffer collateral fibers had been cut  <cit> . a potential implication of this finding relates to the progressive neuronal death in selected hippocampal subfields including ca <dig> noted in patients and most models of tle. this takes on extra significance given that an increase in ca <dig> pyramidal neuron axon sprouting occurs in ka- and pilocarpine-treated animals  <cit> . a combination of these factors and 'intrinsic' changes responsible for burst duration in ca <dig> may contribute to a progressively worsening of seizures noted in tle.

CONCLUSIONS
excitotoxicity is one of the major pathological processes underlying both acute and chronic neurological diseases, including stroke and epilepsy. here we describe the impact on regional neuronal firing patterns in ca <dig> and ca <dig> of an acute ka-induced excitotoxic insult to hippocampal organotypic cultures. a ka insult resulted in a significant dampening of the capacity of ca <dig> regions to generate mg2+-free induced burst neuronal firing at the  <dig> hours time-point. in contrast, this insult lead to increased propensity of the ca <dig> region to synchronized neuronal burst firing by increasing both the rate of occurrence and duration of the events. a loss of 'pacing' by ca <dig> of the synchronisation of ca <dig> accounted for the increased rate of occurrence in bursting events. changes in the properties limited to the ca <dig> region were responsible for increased event duration. these findings provide a framework on which to consider potential contributors to hippocampal hyperexcitability in tle.
