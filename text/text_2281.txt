BACKGROUND
large-scale mutagenesis screens in the zebrafish employing the mutagen enu have isolated several hundred mutant loci that represent putative developmental control genes  <cit> . in order to realize the potential of such screens, systematic genetic mapping of the mutations is necessary. genome scanning by bulked segregant analysis with microsatellite markers is the method of choice for such purposes, as a rough map position can be quickly obtained  <cit> . in the zebrafish it is easy to perform mapcrosses against a polymorphic reference line, followed by brother-sister matings among the f <dig> generation. linkage to a microsatellite marker can then be found by comparing the band intensities of marker alleles in a pool of mutant f <dig> individuals with a pool of their wildtype siblings. because full sibships are analyzed the genetic distance between the mutant locus and a microsatellite can be determined by a simple count of recombinations.

the established reference map for the zebrafish genome is the mgh map  <cit>  which was generated by scoring  <dig>  microsatellite markers  on a panel of  <dig> diploid f <dig> fish of an india × ab reference cross. it covers  <dig>  centimorgans  at a resolution of  <dig>  cm. because the mgh markers do not necessarily show a usable polymorphism in reference crosses of tü × wik our first task was to identify markers that could be used in such a cross.

RESULTS
selection of markers for genome scanning
two sets of microsatellite markers for scanning the genome were developed in parallel with the mutant mapping effort. the starting point was the testing of  <dig> markers for polymorphism in tü × wik crosses  <cit> .  <dig> markers  were selected that showed a polymorphism between tü and wik, with bands easily distinguishable on agarose gels, in at least three out of five reference crosses . additional markers from the mgh map that had shown a robust polymorphism in fine-mapping experiments were subsequently added, while markers that never gave any confirmed linkage in our experiments or that were omitted from the mgh map were removed from our set, eventually resulting in the g <dig> set of  <dig> markers  <cit> . an alternate set of markers was generated by testing another  <dig>  microsatellite markers from the mgh map in five reference crosses.  <dig> of these markers were polymorphic in all five reference crosses. together with  <dig> additional markers these were selected for the h <dig> set of  <dig> markers .

the average distance between markers of the g <dig> set is  <dig>  cm, and all distances are smaller than  <dig> cm, except for a  <dig>  cm interval on lg <dig> . within this particular interval few mgh markers are available, and no suitably polymorphic marker could be identified in our reference crosses. for the h <dig> set the average distance is  <dig>  cm, and all distances are smaller than  <dig>  cm, except for a  <dig>  cm interval on lg <dig>  the more uneven chromosomal distribution of markers in the h <dig> set reflects the fact that frequently the best markers available were already used in the g <dig> set.

our mapping methodology as described below can theoretically detect significant linkage over a distance of approximately  <dig> cm . however, since the lod score is proportional to the number of individuals scored, this range can be easily increased by adding more mutant individuals if a linkage is questionable. our marker sets therefore cover the genome adequately to detect significant linkage with the great majority of mutant loci. all the mutant loci mapped in this work have confirmed linkage to at least one g <dig> or h <dig> marker .

mapping of mutant loci
we report here on the mapping of  <dig> mutant loci identified in the enu-based tübingen i mutagenesis screen  <cit>  and subsequent screening among the mutant collection . for  <dig> of the loci the corresponding genes have already been identified by other researchers, as listed by the zfin database  <cit> ; they are included as controls for our mapping procedure . not included are  <dig> successfully mapped loci for which the corresponding genes were already published by ourselves or such a publication is in preparation, or the carriers of which were lost after mapping.

for each mutation we crossed mutant carriers against the polymorphic reference line wik which was established in our lab for this purpose  <cit> . brother-sister matings were performed in the f <dig> and the f <dig> progeny was sorted by phenotype. dna was prepared on 96-well plates, and aliquots of  <dig> –  <dig> mutant f <dig> individuals and their wildtype siblings were pooled. genome scanning was performed by pcr of the mutant and sibling pools with the markers of the g <dig> marker set, and the band intensities on agarose gels were quantified semi-automatically using nih image software as well as visually assessed to identify potential linkages. mutant and sibling pools representing up to  <dig> different mutations were tested in parallel. verification of the best potential linkages  for each mutation was then attempted by performing pcr of the respective marker with the individual mutants and siblings that had been used for pooling, and counting the recombinant genotypes . siblings were always included on the same gel as a control to confirm that the marker is polymorphic and the two polymorphic bands appear at the proper frequency. if no potential linkage could be verified for a mutation and sufficient material was available, the procedure was repeated once with the g <dig> marker set, and another two times with the h <dig> marker set. if possible, dna was prepared from a different f <dig> pair for each genome scan, since the tübingen and wik lines used are not isogenic and markers that show no usable polymorphism in progeny of one f <dig> pair are therefore sometimes usable in progeny of another one.

a potential linkage was considered confirmed if it had a two-point lod score equal or greater than  <dig>  the individuals were then genotyped for all polymorphic markers from the same marker set and chromosomal region in order to identify, if possible, a pair of markers flanking the mutation, and if that was not possible, the two closest markers on one side of the mutation. occasionally additional markers not in the chosen marker set were also included in the genotyping. decisions on whether or not a mutation was flanked by two markers were based on whether recombinations with the markers occurred independently. for details of the mapping procedure and the calculation of map positions see the methods section and  <cit> .

in total, mapping was attempted for  <dig> mutations from the tübingen i screen and subsequent screens of the mutant collection and successful for  <dig>  giving a success rate of  <dig> %.  <dig> of these could be mapped only with the h <dig> set. unsuccessful mapping experiments were due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient f <dig> individuals and to pcr problems as well as to a lack of polymorphic markers in our marker set. among the mutations to be mapped, a group of  <dig> was prioritized based on interest in their phenotypes. for each of these several additional mapcrosses were set up .  <dig> mutations of this group, or  <dig> % were successfully mapped, providing a lower limit for the percentage of mutations that our marker sets and methodology is capable of mapping if sufficient f <dig> individuals are available. the biggest distance to markers on either side at which we could confirm linkage was  <dig>  cm , approaching the theoretical cutoff of  <dig> cm.

chromosomal distribution of mutant loci
between  <dig>  and  <dig>  zebrafish genes have been estimated to have visible mutant phenotypes in embryonic and early larval development  <cit> . therefore the loci reported in this work represent at least one eighth and possibly as much as quarter of all the loci that can be mutated to give a visible phenotype.

the number of mapped loci assigned to each chromosome is between  <dig> and  <dig>  . these numbers are not significantly correlated with the number of mutant loci per chromosome identified by insertional mutagenesis in the laboratory of n. hopkins   or with the number of ensembl genes per chromosome in the ensembl zv <dig> assembly  <cit>  ; by comparison, the values of amsterdam et al. have a slightly stronger correlation to the number of ensembl transcripts . because mapping with our methodology was successful for 80% of all mutations for which it was attempted, possible deficiencies of the mapping method cannot fully account for this low correlation. rather, it probably reflects an uneven distribution of genes with specific, visible phenotypes in embryos or early larvae as identified in enu mutagenesis screening, and the absence of such selectivity in the insertional mutagenesis experiment, demonstrating that both types of mutagenesis experiments complement each other in their coverage of their genome. moreover, we cannot rule out region-specific differences in enu mutagenesis efficiency.

assessment of mapping quality
in order to assess the quality of our mapping data we looked at the  <dig> mutant loci that were cloned by other researchers. for  <dig> of these independently derived map positions of the affected gene are publicly available on zmap  .

a comparison of the linkage group assignments shows that two of the  <dig> genes  are assigned to a different linkage group by zmap, in both cases based on results from the heat shock  panel  <cit> . however, several published linkages to genetic markers support our linkage group assignment of frs/slc25a  <cit>  while our assignment of ovl/ift <dig> is supported by the t <dig> panel  and by the latest version of the hs map  <cit> . in conclusion, none of our linkage group assignments is conclusively contradicted by gene mapping.

next we compared the map positions of the mutations with those of the genes on zmap . if we assume the gene positions to be correct, we obtain a standard error of our mutant map positions of  <dig>  cm. further assuming a normal distribution of errors, we can predict that approximately  <dig> % of the genes should be within  <dig>  cm  of the rough mapping position of the mutation. indeed,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes mapped on the same chromosome  are within two standard errors of the mutation, and  <dig> out of  <dig>  within one standard error. actually both mutation and gene mapping contribute to the observed errors to an unknown degree, so that  <dig>  cm merely represents an upper limit for the standard error of our mapping procedure.

CONCLUSIONS
we have obtained rough map positions for over  <dig> zebrafish mutants with an accuracy of approximately  <dig> cm and thereby validated the usefulness of our methodology for rapid, systematic and inexpensive microsatellite mapping of zebrafish mutations. the dataset that we have produced is a first step towards identification of the genes affected by the  <dig> mutations that are not yet cloned.

in candidate gene approaches, our data can substantially narrow down the number of candidate genes, since on the order of  <dig> % of the genome are outside the two-standard-errors confidence limit of our map positions. positional cloning approaches in the absence of obvious candidate genes will still require fine mapping by genotyping of additional individuals and identification of more closely linked markers, using the flanking markers identified by us as starting points. particularly thorough fine-mapping is required in centromeric regions because the genetic recombination rate is often several-fold reduced in such regions  <cit> , an effect that can be easily observed in the zebrafish by comparing the genetic map and the radiation hybrid map  <cit> . nevertheless, we expect our map positions to be useful even without knowledge of the affected genes, as they can suggest allelism of mutations with a similar phenotype identified in future screens.

we have found that a relatively small number of microsatellite markers is sufficient to scan almost the entire genome and that the experimental procedures are robust and easy to perform. other methods that have been proposed for the mapping of mutant loci in the zebrafish include half-tetrad analysis with microsatellite markers, genome scanning with snps and microarray based snp mapping. while half-tetrad analysis requires only  <dig> markers to obtain a linkage group assignment  <cit> , it has the disadvantage that gynogenetic diploid fish must be generated first, which makes this approach less convenient for high-throughput analysis. in the course of the ongoing zebrafish genome project, more than  <dig>  snps have been identified  <cit>  offering an enticing alternative to microsatellite markers, but snp genotyping is far more costly than the agarose based method employed by us. genotyping of snps in a bulked segregant panel is also possible by microarray hybridization  <cit> . however, the snps identified to date are specific to the strains they were developed from and may not be informative in mapcrosses performed with different strains . furthermore such a microarray experiment replaces only two steps in our mapping procedure, namely the pooled pcr and its associated gel run, which represent only a minor part of the total mapping effort, as compared to fish breeding, sorting of f <dig> embryos and confirmation of the bulked segregant results by genotyping of f <dig> individuals. future microarray based approaches may make it possible to dispense with the genotyping of individuals entirely, provided that a very large number of snps can be multiplexed in a single microarray hybridization such that it immediately provides a reliable map position. meanwhile, genome scanning with microsatellite markers remains the method of choice as it is equally suitable for the mapping of individual mutations by laboratories with limited genomics resources, and for high throughput projects such as ours.
