BACKGROUND
paracoccidioides spp., a complex of several phylogenetic species, is the agent of paracoccidioidomycosis . paracoccidioides spp. is a thermodimorphic fungus, which grows in the soil as saprobic mycelium, resulting in the formation of propagules, which initiate infection in humans when inhaled into the respiratory tract. subsequently, in the lung, the mycelia propagules develop into yeast cells  <cit> . pcm is endemic in latin america  <cit> , with 80% of cases reported in brazil, where it is the eighth-leading cause of mortality among infectious and parasitic diseases, establishing it as a serious public health problem  <cit> .

itraconazole is suggested to be the best alternative for first-line therapy of pcm and should be administered over a long period  <cit> . itraconazole is a triazole antifungal drug, which are multi-ringed synthetic compounds containing three nitrogen atoms in the azole ring. mechanistically, the triazole drugs inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes, and cause abnormalities in the membrane permeability and consequently cell death  <cit> . itraconazole and related azole derivatives act by blocking the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway through the inhibition of the fungal cytochrome p <dig> enzyme lanosterol demethylase   <cit> .

the global response to azoles, including itraconazole, of fungi such as saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , trichophyton rubrum <cit> , aspergillus fumigatus <cit>  and candida albicans <cit>  has been studied using transcriptional and proteomic approaches. in general, the findings revealed both specific and nonspecific antifungal-induced changes in gene and protein regulation. there was an increase in expression of the genes involved in lipid, fatty acid and sterol metabolism, as well as genes involved in drug adaptation, including cell stress response, drug efflux and small molecule transport.

despite of the importance of paracoccidioides spp., nothing is known about the mechanism of itraconazole inhibition in this pathogen. here, cdna libraries were constructed to obtain expressed sequence tags  of paracoccidioides spp. the representational difference analysis  technique was used to identify changes in the transcriptional profile of paracoccidioides spp. in response to itraconazole, with the aim of identifying the adaptative response of the fungus to the compound. transcript levels were also measured during the infection process. in addition, the transcript levels of erg genes, ergosterol levels and ergosterol localization were evaluated.

RESULTS
libraries characteristics
a total of  <dig> ests were successfully sequenced. from these,  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated ests were obtained from yeast cells after incubation with itraconazole for 1 h, containing  <dig> singlets and  <dig> contigs for up-regulated transcripts and three singlets and  <dig> contigs for down-regulated ones. in addition,  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated ests were obtained from yeast cells after incubation with itraconazole for 2 h, containing three singlets and  <dig> contigs for up-regulated and seven singlets and  <dig> contigs for down-regulated. the ests obtained were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information  database under accession numbers: libest_ <dig> paracoccidioides pb <dig> itraconazole 1 h up library, libest_ <dig> paracoccidioides pb <dig> itraconazole 1 h down library, libest_ <dig> paracoccidioides pb <dig> itraconazole 2 h up library and libest_ <dig> paracoccidioides pb <dig> itraconazole 2 h down library.

the ests were processed using the blast2go program, which allowed us to annotate and identify the different functional groups. the functional classification was based on the homology of each est, considering e-values ≤10- <dig> significant, using blastx against the genbank non-redundant database and the mips functional annotation scheme . the analyses indicated the presence of transcripts from different functional categories: metabolism/energy, transcription, cell rescue, defense and virulence, protein synthesis and biogenesis, protein fate, cellular transport, biogenesis of cellular components and cellular communication.

global gene expression monitoring in paracoccidioides pb <dig> upon itraconazole treatment
a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed upon exposure to itraconazole, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. ests obtained from 1 h treatment with itraconazole were clustered into functional classes which were defined as metabolism/energy ; transcription ; cell rescue, defense and virulence ; protein synthesis and biogenesis ; protein fate ; cellular transport ; biogenesis of cellular components ; cellular communication ; and unclassified proteins . ests from 2 h samples were clustered into functional classes which were defined as: metabolism/energy ; transcription ; cell rescue, defense and virulence ; protein synthesis and biogenesis ; protein fate ; cellular transport ; and unclassified protein  .

it were found genes precursors of acety groups, from different metabolic pathways, such as acyl-coa dehydrogenase , isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase , pyruvate kinase  and cysteine desulfurase .

in addition, genes precursors to the components of membrane and cell walls were found, such as phospholipids and carbohydrates, as well as genes related to detoxification. these components are diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase , chitin synthase regulator  <dig> , hemolysin-iii channel protein , tetracycline resistance protein , voltage-gated ca2+ alpha subunit  and the mfs transporter.

expression profiles of genes in paracoccidioides pb <dig> yeast cells
confirmation of the expression levels of the ests found in the redundancy analysis was performed by qrt-pcr analysis, including paracoccidioides pb <dig> glutathione s-transferase , , betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase , cysd, ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase , carnitine/acyl-carnitine carrier , c <dig> transcription factor , adh, heat shock protein , gpr1/fun34/yaah family protein, pk, dgat, ivd, ubiquitin-protein ligase , family integral membrane protein , hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and atp synthase f <dig> subunit  <dig> . these genes were chosen because of their high frequency or as representatives of different functional categories. differential expression profiles of genes corroborated rda data .

analysis of erg transcripts by qrt-pcr
because erg transcripts and proteins levels were changed in the presence of azoles in fungi such as t. rubrum <cit> , s. cerevisiae <cit> , c. albicans <cit>  and a. fumigatus <cit>  we investigated whether ergosterol synthesis-related transcripts such as lanosterol  <dig> α-demethylase , c <dig> -desaturase , delta-24-sterol c-methyltransferase , c- <dig> sterol desaturase  and c- <dig> methyl sterol oxidase  were changed in paracoccidioides pb <dig> after 1 h, 2 h and 6 h of exposure to itraconazole using specific oligonucleotides in qrt-pcr. the results showed that all transcripts were increased at all time points .

paracoccidioides pb <dig> transcripts identified in mice treated with itraconazole
we investigated whether the regulated transcripts identified by rda experiments using pb <dig> also occurred in another cryptic species, pb <dig>  in vivo. balb/c mice infected with paracoccidioides pb <dig> were treated with itraconazole, and spleens were removed. the treatment with itraconazole reduced the fungal burden 42% in the spleens. rnas extracted from recovered fungus were analyzed in qrt-pcr experiments using mfs, gst and chsr genes. in agreement with the rda data, all the evaluated genes were up-regulated in spleen fungal samples after treatment with itraconazole .

gst-specific activity correlates with transcriptional data
because gst transcripts were up-regulated in our study and are described in the literature as important for the detoxification of many different xenobiotics  <cit> , we evaluated the gst-specific activity in protein extracts of fungus grown in the presence of itraconazole. gst-specific activity in the presence of itraconazole  was  <dig>  times higher than in the absence of itraconazole  .

analysis of the ergosterol level
because transcript levels of ergosterol pathway components were changed in the presence of itraconazole, we evaluated if itraconazole could disturb the total intracellular level of ergosterol. the method for quantification of ergosterol used here takes advantage of the unique four-peak spectral absorption pattern produced by extracted sterols between  <dig> and 300 nm. comparing the scans obtained from control  and the corresponding itraconazole-exposed cultures , a decrease of 39% and  <dig> % was identified in the ergosterol content of paracoccidioides pb <dig> and pb <dig> yeast cells, respectively grown in the presence of itraconazole.

effect of itraconazole on ergosterol localization in paracoccidioides pb <dig> and pb <dig> yeast cells
because itraconazole induces changes in transcript levels in the ergosterol pathway and disturbs the total intracellular ergosterol content  <cit> , the localization of ergosterol molecules was assessed in paracoccidioides pb <dig> and pb <dig> yeast cells. ergosterol was detected by its ability to bind to the dye filipin. this characteristic has been used to detect ergosterol in dimorphic fungi  <cit> , yeasts, filamentous fungi  <cit>  and mammalian cells  <cit> .

the distribution of ergosterol on the surface of paracoccidioides pb <dig> and pb <dig> yeast cells treated with itraconazole was strikingly different from that observed in the control untreated cells. control cells showed a homogeneous fluorescence distribution . in contrast, the cells treated with itraconazole displayed dark regions without filipin fluorescence .

a model for the paracoccidioides spp. adaptation to the itraconazole
the most prominent adaptations undergone by paracoccidioides spp. during exposure to itraconazole are summarized in figure  <dig>  see the discussion for details.

discussion
among the paracoccidioides pb <dig> genes regulated by itraconazole were those involved in cellular transport, metabolism/energy, transcription, cell rescue, defense and virulence. similar and different groups were also observed in other fungi in response to different azoles  <cit>  . among the genes affected, we identified genes in common with other fungi, as well as genes unique to paracoccidioides. in fact few paracoccidioides spp. genes were shared with genes from other fungi. this could be due to different techniques and classes of azoles used in the works. the comparison with ither fungi show that cell processes related to stress response, xenobiotic efflux are trigered upon itraconazol in different fungi. the genes exclusively regulated in paracoccidioides spp. reveal that fungi response to drugs can partially involve specific processes that may be related to different sensibility of differetn fungi to itraconazol treatment. this could be due to different techniques and classes of azoles used in the works.

although erg genes were not identified in the rda experiments, qrt-pcr results showed that erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig> and erg <dig> genes were temporally regulated, particularly after longer contact with the drug . acetyl is a carbon donator in the cell production of ergosterol  <cit> . acetyl coa seems to be intensively produced due to up-regulation of transcripts from different metabolic pathways, including lipid degradation by hormone-sensitive lipase  and acad and amino acid metabolism by ivd. acetyl coa pool increasing in the cell is optimized with reduction of aconitase trasncripts , once this enzymes participates of the acetyl-coa oxidation in tca. in addition, the induction of badh and cysd could lead to production of thiamine, a cofactor to pyruvate dehydrogenase , which produces acetyl coa from pyruvate, whose production is increased by the action of pyruvate kinase .

ergosterol is produced by the action of erg enzymes  <cit> . here, the action of itraconazole on ergosterol biosynthesis and its distribution on paracoccidioides pb <dig> and pb <dig> yeast cells surface was documented. ergosterol is an essential component of fungal plasma membranes; it affects membrane permeability and the activities of membrane-bound enzymes. this sterol is a major component of secretory vesicles and has an important role in mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . it can thus be expected that changes in ergosterol levels and in sterol structure could influence the activities of several metabolic pathways. the mechanism responsible for the global up-regulation of erg genes in response to azoles remains unclear. one theory postulates that depletion of ergosterol or another sterol formed late in the pathway increases global erg expression; another argues that accumulation of an early substrate or toxic sterol by product induces erg expression  <cit> .

the correlation between cell wall integrity and perturbation of the ergosterol pathway in t. rubrun suggests that changes in the cell wall may compensate for stress in the plasma membrane  <cit> . the phospholipid level in the cell membrane seems to be affected in paracoccidioides pb <dig>  as indicated by up-regulation of dgat and phosphatidyl synthase , which produce phospholipids. dgat has been found in several transcriptomes to date, indicating it may be important for the fungi response to azoles  <cit> .

chs and their regulatory genes are important for the growth and virulence of human fungal pathogens, including c. albicans <cit> . it has been observed that high ergosterol levels can inhibit chitin synthases, whereas c. albicans mutants with low ergosterol content showed increased levels of chitin synthesis  <cit> . chsr was up-regulated in paracoccidioides pb <dig> in the presence of itraconazole.

glutathione s-transferases, which are important for the detoxification of many xenobiotic compounds, are a family of multifunctional enzymes that play a role in cellular detoxification and excretion of a wide variety of xenobiotic substances  <cit> . it has been reported that glutathione s-transferases correlate with fungi defense in response to damage caused by oxidative stress, xenobiotics and antifungal compounds  <cit> . gst was up-regulated in paracoccidioides in the presence of itraconazole.

in paracoccidioides pb <dig>  genes encoding several classes of transporters were up-regulated upon exposure to itraconazole. mfs transporter and teta, for example, have been implicated in azole resistance  <cit> . drug resistance is often associated with the overexpression of genes encoding efflux pumps, which is presumed to prevent intracellular accumulation of itraconazole in fungus  <cit> . the up-regulation of paracoccidioides pb <dig> mfs, gst and chsr transcripts also occur in vivo, as demonstrated here by qrt-pcr using rnas extracted from spleens of mice.

it should be noted that a number of genes involved in small molecule transport, especially in ion transport, were differentially expressed in paracoccidioides pb <dig> in response to itraconazole. up-regulated genes included cav, imp and hlyiii. down-regulated genes included  and integral membrane mpv17/pmp <dig>  the inhibition of ergosterol, which is an essential component of fungal biological membranes, including the plasma membrane, can lead to destabilization of the membrane, leakage of cellular components and influx of extracellular ingredients. therefore, the regulation of transporter genes is necessary to maintain ionic homeostasis within the fungal cell when membranes are damaged by itraconazole  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to analyze the changes in the paracoccidioides spp. gene expression profile following triazole exposure. among the genes affected, we identified genes unique to paracoccidioides pb <dig>  as well as genes in common with other fungi. in vitro results were validated by in vivo experiments. the results obtained here should assist in understanding the mode of action of itraconazole in paracoccidioides spp.
