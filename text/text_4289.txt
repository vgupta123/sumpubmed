BACKGROUND
meiosis is obligatory for sexual reproduction and is comprised of one round of dna replication followed by two rounds of cell division. there are three key processes that occur during early meiosis which are responsible for the juxtaposition of homologous chromosomes required for successful production of haploid gametes, namely chromosome pairing, recombination and chromosome synapsis. studies investigating the molecular nature of homologous chromosome pairing have revealed a complex relationship between these three processes.

complexity is particularly pronounced in polyploid organisms such as the allohexaploid bread wheat . bread wheat contains seven groups of chromosomes which are derived from three diploid progenitor species . despite the genome complexity of this important crop, each chromosome will pair only with its homologue, despite the potential for pairing with an equivalent chromosome from one of the other two related or homoeologous genomes. extensive cytological analysis of chromosome dynamics during early meiosis in normal bread wheat and mutants such as ph <dig> and ph <dig> , which display reduced specificity of chromosome pairing to homologues, have provided valuable information on the control of chromosome pairing in this organism  <cit> . however, to date there are no individual proteins that have been identified and characterised from bread wheat that have been shown to have a role in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis.

pairing of homologous chromosomes is closely followed by synapsis through the formation of a proteinaceous structure referred to as the synaptonemal complex   <cit> . the evolutionary conservation of the sc within sexually reproducing organisms and its demonstrated association with recombination indicates a fundamental and critical role during meiosis i . the sc is composed of three components: the axial/lateral elements, transverse filaments and a dense central element. while several genes encoding sc and sc-associated proteins including zip <dig>  <cit>  and scp <dig>  <cit>  have been isolated and characterised in both yeast and mammals since the discovery of this structure  <dig> years ago, it has only been recently that the first sc plant specific protein was reported  <cit> , even though this structure has been comprehensively dissected cytologically. the slow progress in plants is mainly due to limited sequence conservation of sc proteins from various eukaryotic species, as reflected in a study of zyp <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana, which shares only  <dig> and 20% sequence identity to zip <dig> and scp <dig> from yeast and mouse respectively  <cit> . this problem is being overcome through two approaches. reverse genetics is being used in arabidopsis and rice to identify genes involved in chromosome synapsis by analysing mutants that display an abnormal synaptic phenotype during early meiosis, and additionally, an in silico screening of databases is used to identify proteins that contain secondary structures that are conserved amongst known sc proteins  <cit> .

one class of meiotic mutants used to identify genes that code for components of the sc in plants are termed asynaptic. these mutants are typically characterised as being defective in homologous chromosome synapsis, from which other defects follow, including dramatically increased frequency of univalents at pachytene and reduced fertility  <cit> . several such genes have been reported in the literature including hop <dig> from yeast   <cit> , asy <dig> from arabidopsis and brassica oleracea  <cit>  and pair <dig> from rice   <cit> . in addition, the location and activity of asy <dig> orthologues during meiosis in maize and rye has been investigated using the atasy <dig> antibody in studies of mutants displaying abnormal chromosomal morphology during prophase i, which also supports results obtained from arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . a common feature of the three characterised asynaptic genes is the presence of a horma domain   <cit>  which appears to facilitate direct interaction of proteins containing this domain with chromatin during mitosis and meiosis, including chromatin associated with dna adducts and dna double stranded breaks  <cit> .

in an attempt to further understand the mechanism of pairing/synapsis of homologous chromosomes during meiosis in bread wheat, we have characterised the expression and protein localisation of the wheat orthologue of asy <dig> of arabidopsis, taasy <dig>  this gene shares significant sequence identity and similar features  to previously characterised asynaptic genes including the arabidopsis, brassica and rice orthologues and is likely to play a pivotal role during meiosis in bread wheat.

RESULTS
taasy <dig> is a wheat orthologue of atasy <dig>  boasy <dig> and rice pair <dig> and is located on wheat chromosome group 5
analysis of the complete open reading frame  of taasy <dig> showed significant sequence similarity to the previously characterised asynapsis genes pair <dig> from rice, asy <dig> from arabidopsis and brassica, and to a lesser extent, hop <dig> from yeast. the taasy <dig> orf is  <dig> bp, which encodes a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. full-length protein comparisons to the other characterised asynapsis sequences revealed high levels of sequence identity . further analysis of the translated taasy <dig> sequence showed that it contained a horma  domain. the level of identity between the horma domains from taasy <dig> compared to ospair <dig>  atasy <dig>  boasy <dig> and schop <dig> are significant, with values of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively .

the taasy <dig> gene structure was obtained using sequence analysis of gene specific fragments amplified via pcr from chinese spring. subsequent analysis revealed that taasy <dig> is composed of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns and is greater than  <dig>  kb in length .

southern blot analysis was performed using membranes containing digested genomic dna from the nullisomic-tetrasomic series and wild-type chinese spring to identify the chromosome location of taasy <dig>  using a full length cdna clone as a probe, taasy <dig> was mapped to chromosomes of group  <dig>  with a single copy of this gene on each of the three bread wheat genomes a, b and d. interestingly, the rice orthologue of taasy <dig>  pair <dig>  has previously been mapped to rice chromosome  <dig>  the long arm of rice  <dig> shows conservation of gene order with wheat chromosome group  <dig> 

we further localised taasy <dig> using a pcr-based approach with primers specific for the a genome and multiple bread wheat deletion lines. genome specificity of the primers was confirmed with amplification of a  <dig> bp fragment using template from the three nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of chromosome group  <dig> and wild-type chinese spring . bread wheat deletion lines that contained varying distal deletions of 5a long arm  were then screened using these primers . the fragment specific for the a genome was amplified in a deletion line that contained  <dig>  fraction length  of the 5al , but not in a line that contained  <dig>  fl of 5al  . this suggests that taasy <dig> is located in a region between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fl on 5al when measured from the centromere.

taasy <dig> is highly expressed in anthers at prophase i of meiosis
taasy <dig> expression was investigated using northern analysis, microarray and quantitative real time pcr  technology. in the northern blots of a tissue series  and sub-staged meiotic anthers , taasy <dig> expression was found to be meiosis-specific and significantly up-regulated during pre-meiosis and leptotene to pachytene when compared to the other stages represented. quantitative analysis of taasy <dig> transcript levels was initially performed by microarray using the wheat affymetrix genechip®. from the  <dig>  probe sets on the wheat genechip® which represents  <dig>  transcripts, two probe sets were identical to the full length taasy <dig> cdna sequence that was previously isolated: ta. <dig> .s1_at and ta. <dig> .s1_at, at positions  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, respectively. the level of expression detected for the two microarray probe sets closely reflected the northern results, with taasy <dig> expression significantly elevated during pre-meiosis and leptotene to pachytene of prophase i . detection within the mature anthers was significantly reduced , indicating inactivation of taasy <dig> transcription in this tissue. ta. <dig> .s1_at displayed a significant decrease in transcript abundance, with a greater than 22-fold reduction between leptotene to pachytene of prophase i and the development of mature anthers.

to complement and confirm the accuracy of the microarray results, q-pcr was also performed to investigate the transcript expression levels of taasy <dig> across a range of tissues. while low levels of expression were evident in leaf and root tips which were not detected in the tissue series northern, the results revealed significant levels of expression in anthers during the early stages of meiosis , confirming the results obtained from the other two techniques used. in parallel, the microarray and q-pcr platforms exhibited a correlation value of  <dig>  between each other thus suggesting that the results were highly reproducible  <cit> .

these assays all used rna isolated from whole wheat anthers and contained many tissues in addition to the meiocytes; including tapetum, epidermis, endothecium and segments of the filament. demonstration of meiocyte expression and a role for the taasy <dig> protein in pairing required sub-cellular localisation of the gene product.

protein analysis validates taasy <dig> expression in meiotic tissue and location adjacent to the axial elements of chromosomes at early prophase i
using a taasy <dig> specific antibody, a high level of protein was detected in meiotic tissue , as expected from the transcript analyses. this protein was approximately  <dig> to  <dig> kda in size. the antibody also detected a faint signal in the protein samples of each vegetative tissue analysed .

analysis by transmission electron microscopy , using sections of anthers that contained cells undergoing meiosis, revealed that the taasy <dig> antibody specifically labelled the nucleus and structures that form part of the sc. during leptotene and early zygotene, taasy <dig> associates with chromatin adjoining axial elements  similar to that seen with atasy <dig> and ospair <dig>  <cit> . upon complete sc formation in pachytene nuclei, taasy <dig> was found to interact with axis-associated chromatin, with labelling present amongst dense chromatin adjacent to lateral elements of the tri-partite sc  . labelling was not observed in nuclei of cells that were progressing through diplotene and diakinesis, suggesting that the protein is degraded or removed upon disassociation of the sc . the two negative controls including grids without primary antibody  and grids labelled with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody  displayed no labelling.

discussion
primarily, chromosome pairing and synapsis in bread wheat has been extensively analysed using mutants, such as ph1b and ph2a, which display reduced restriction of chromosome pairing to homologues . the major loci  responsible for this phenotype have been mapped to 5bl and 3ds, respectively. since their discovery many cytological studies have been conducted to investigate the diploid behaviour of chromosome pairing during meiosis in bread wheat  <cit> . more recently, significant work on chromosome pairing dynamics has led to theoretical models which help explain how this complex organism maintains its diploid behaviour during meiosis  <cit> . coupled with the cytological studies have been the extensive mapping strategies of griffiths and colleagues  <cit>  to identify the gene responsible for the ph <dig> phenotype, culminating in the identification of four cdc2-related genes and a sub-telomeric heterochromatic region that translocated from chromosome 3al, as candidates for the ph <dig> effect. theses approaches have been built around the use of the genetic information to track down genes that control pairing. there have been few reports of studies aimed at deciphering components of the wheat meiotic machinery based on candidates identified in other systems. the characterisation of taasy <dig> described here suggests that knowledge from other systems can be applied to bread wheat and can help build a molecular view of pairing and recombination.

while the presence of taasy <dig> on chromosome group  <dig> implies that it does not represent ph <dig>  its location and putative role, based on the asynaptic phenotype of arabidopsis and rice mutants, suggests it may still be involved with either the product of the ph <dig> and/or ph <dig> loci; albeit indirectly. based on the findings of griffiths et al.  <cit> , and southern analysis that we have conducted using the ph <dig> mutant, ph1b , taasy <dig> does not represent ph <dig>  given its location on the long arm of chromosome 5a, it is possible that taasy <dig> represents one of the previously reported minor chromosome pairing promoters on 5al and/or 5dl  <cit> . however, further experimentation will be required to determine if any of these loci represent taasy <dig>  this work is likely to involve precise location of the gene relative to various bread wheat deletion lines that have previously been reported  <cit> .

taasy <dig>  asy <dig> from arabidopsis and brassica, and pair <dig> from rice represent the only horma domain containing proteins identified in plants  <cit> . the amino acid sequences of the asy <dig> and pair <dig> proteins display significant sequence similarity to taasy <dig>  when comparing only the horma domain of all known asynaptic proteins reported, sequence identity increased significantly suggesting that the horma domain is essential for the function of taasy <dig> and its orthologues. however, this is not always the case when comparing sequences of meiotic proteins across various organisms, with sequence identities varying widely for proteins involved in the evolutionarily conserved process of chromosome pairing and synapsis  <cit> . this is highlighted by the difficulty to predict meiotic activity of ospair <dig> based around the extensive knowledge of schop <dig>  <cit> .

the taasy <dig> gene structure is very similar to the reported structures of atasy <dig> and ospair <dig>  with all three genes having  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns. the similarity in gene structure of taasy <dig> and ospair <dig> is also reflected in the location of the two genes, with chromosome group  <dig> of bread wheat displaying high levels of gene order conservation with rice chromosome  <dig>  on which ospair <dig> resides  <cit> .

the three transcript analysis procedures used in this study clearly indicated significant expression of taasy <dig> in meiotic tissue, with highest expression predominantly confined to pre-meiosis and leptotene to pachytene. the leptotene to pachytene result was expected based on these stages being when synapsis occurs, which is also reflected by the phenotypes of asy <dig> and pair <dig> mutants where chromosomes fail to synapse  <cit> .

the q-pcr data indicated that transcript levels of taasy <dig> remained elevated from diplotene through to the completion of telophase ii. this may be due to minor asynchrony between the collection of anthers that were selected for staging and subsequent rna isolation. in addition, as wheat meiosis takes only  <dig> hours to complete it is possible that the elevated expression seen later in meiosis represents the mrna that remained in the cells as they rapidly progressed through the meiotic cycle, after the relatively lengthy prophase i period of  <dig> hours  <cit> . although the taasy <dig> transcript was not detected in vegetative tissues using northern analysis, q-pcr and microarray analysis suggested that there were very low levels of expression . both these technology platforms are extremely sensitive to very low transcript levels.

the elevated transcript expression in meiotic tissue correlates with the detection of protein seen in the western analysis. the very low level of protein in the leaf and root tissues contrasts to results from arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . however, the differences detected between the reports could be attributed to alternative experimental procedures used, including the protein extraction procedure and the higher concentration of primary antibody used in this study.

while it was not possible to define whether taasy <dig> associated directly with axial elements, immunolocalisation using tem revealed that taasy <dig> associates with chromatin regions of axial elements prior to formation of the sc, as well as chromatin of lateral elements within a formed sc. these results are consistent with the previous data in arabidopsis and rice where asy1/pair <dig> are shown to have a role in pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes. although taasy <dig> is located adjacent to axial elements prior to sc formation, it is unlikely to have a role in initiation of axial element formation since dense axial elements still formed in the rice pair <dig> mutants. in addition, as the axial elements that formed in the pair <dig> mutant were comparable in size to those in the wild-type plant, especially when compared to the differences in axial element size and distribution of asy <dig> in the maize mutant afd <dig>  it is unlikely that the labelling of taasy <dig> to axial elements in wheat is due to a role in axial element elongation  <cit> .

localisation of taasy <dig> to components of the sc both before and after sc formation indicates a role for this protein in synapsis and/or pairing of homologous chromosomes. a role for taasy <dig> in synapsis is supported by results of mikhailova et al.  <cit> . using a rye mutant that failed to correctly synapse homologous chromosomes, mikhailova et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that asy <dig> and zyp <dig>  still load correctly onto chromosome axes without formation of the tripartite sc. it is plausible therefore that the localisation of taasy <dig> to axial elements prior to synapsis may represent a role in recruiting components of the sc, such as zyp <dig>  to the axial elements in preparation for sc formation.

while support for a role in chromosome pairing is less obvious, it has been shown that the arabidopsis asy <dig> mutant exhibits near normal centromere and telomere pairing behaviour during interphase and leptotene but subsequent stages are atypical, with non-recognisable pairing and synapsis of homologues  <cit> . this indicates that asy <dig> is active between the time point where telomeres and centromeres first associate and homologues correctly synapse. therefore, in bread wheat taasy <dig> represents an interesting candidate for further research into how homologues are resolved from their homoeologues, since the seven homoeologous centromere clusters form prior to the resolution of  <dig> homologous chromosome pairs  <cit> .

a long term objective of this research is to pursue an efficient methodology for the induction of pairing control and recombination in bread wheat. significant progress was recently made towards this goal with the molecular characterisation of the ph <dig> locus by griffiths et al.  <cit> . however, to understand the mechanism of action of cdc2-kinases found at the ph <dig> locus, it may be necessary to characterise down stream proteins involved in chromosome synapsis, such as taasy <dig>  to this end we have begun investigating what proteins interact with taasy <dig> and where these proteins are located within the bread wheat genome.

CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated and characterised the wheat homologue of schop <dig>  atasy <dig> and ospair2; called taasy <dig>  this study has enhanced our understanding of proteins that are responsible for the correct pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes in bread wheat. taasy <dig> is located on chromosome group  <dig>  with a copy on each of the three genomes; a, b and d. transcript and protein expression analyses indicate a role for this protein during the early stages of meiosis, specifically during prophase i. this was confirmed by immunolocalisation using tem, which showed that taasy <dig> interacts with chromatin of sc associated structures during zygotene and pachytene, before being removed or degraded during later stages.
