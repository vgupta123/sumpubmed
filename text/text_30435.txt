BACKGROUND
genomic structural variations , including insertion, deletion, rearrangement, and duplication are important sources of human genetic diversity and may be responsible for human diseases . with the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, computational tools have been developed to utilize next-generation sequencing data to identify svs, such as breakdancer  <cit> , pindel  <cit> , prism  <cit> , delly  <cit> , cnvnator  <cit>  and gustaf  <cit> . it has been noted that small inversions may provide important insights into genome evolution and disease mechanisms  <cit> . previous studies have reported the discovery of small inversions by comparing the human genome with other mammalian genomes  <cit> . however, despite the progress of computational tools using ngs data to identify svs, our understanding and strategies for characterizing small inversions remain limited  <cit> . in this work, we focus on micro-inversions , defined as small inversions shorter than 100 bp, which are mostly ignored by existing methods.

computational tools for sv detection mostly rely on read mapping. however, we found that reads with potential mis, which cannot be mapped to the reference genome initially, are usually discarded as “unmapped reads” by existing alignment tools. as no mapping information is available for the initially unmapped reads, most existing tools are incapable to detect mis shorter than the read length. generally speaking, existing methods use features such as read depth, read pair information, and split reads to identify svs  <cit> . yet there are still several challenges to use these features to detect mis. the small size of mis makes the identification difficult. the approaches used in methods based on read depth, e.g., cnvnator, would perform poorly with the small size of mis without locating the breakpoints. the strategies in utilizing read pairs  and split reads  are also not appropriate to identify mis less than 100 bp, because the size of svs detected by these tools is dependent on insert size of paired-end reads and insensitive to variants as small as mis. additionally, to increase the applicability of the method, it is important to handle datasets with low coverage. for large-scale projects such as the  <dig> genomes project , there is increasing number of low coverage data  <cit> . for example, the sample na <dig>  provided by 1kgp from two paired-end libraries with 15x coverage, has been frequently selected by variant detection tools for performance comparisons   <cit> . however, most of the human individual genomes were generated with a low coverage of 2–4x in 1kgp so far. finally, it is also challenging to identify mis in a read with multiple variants, as other types of variants , small indels and other rearrangements), may also occur in nearby regions of the mi.

in this paper, we focus on mi identification from unmapped ngs short reads. our algorithm, named mid , specifically detects mis shorter than the read length. moreover, mid can be applied to very low coverage samples. what makes mid different from other variant detection tools is that it is sensitive to very small size mis, and capable of detecting mis with multiple breakpoints in one read. moreover, mid proves reliability in low coverage data by integrating multiple samples. the simulation results showed that mid can detect mis efficiently and reliably using unmapped ngs short reads with low false positives. by applying mid to 1kgp data, we identified  <dig> mis,  <dig> of which are intergenic,  <dig> mis are intronic, and  <dig> mis are exonic. we also applied mid to the lung squamous cell carcinoma whole exome sequencing  data from ccle, where we identified  <dig> mis.

RESULTS
performance of mi detection on simulated data
until recently, few attempts have been made for mi detection using ngs data. to the best of our knowledge, only a recent tool called gustaf  <cit> , can detect inversions from 30 bp to 500 bp, which in principle can recognize mis shorter than the read length. gustaf is a tool based on a split-read approach, which records the local alignments provided by other tools and draws a split-read graph to use standard graph algorithms to evaluate relationships of the alignments. in addition, it should be noted that no suitable real datasets with confident annotation are available as a benchmark. we therefore used simulated datasets to evaluate the performance of mid. two different types of simulated datasets were generated in the current work: one with  <dig>  mis only , and the other one with  <dig>  mis surrounded by other types of variants . for dataset  <dig>  we simulated  <dig>  mis ranging from 15 bp to 40 bp, following a normal distribution for mi size, randomly on the whole chr <dig>  from the human genome assembly hg <dig>  <cit> . for dataset  <dig>  we simulated  <dig>  mis surrounded by  <dig>  other structural variants  following a normal distribution for mi size randomly on chr <dig>  with a size range of 15–40 bp. we also simulated illumina paired-end short reads  using maq  <cit>  with an error rate  <dig> . both simulated datasets had  <dig> different sub-datasets with coverage varying from 2x to 60x . we then ran the burrows-wheeler alignment  tool  <cit>  in the same way as in the 1kgp to get unmapped short reads.table  <dig> sensitivity , positive predictive value  and standard deviation  for mis simulated onto chr10



to have a clear view of our evaluation results, we define several metrics. if at least one simulated read generated from the reference sequence cover the mi, we call the mi as “detectable mi”. if 80 % of both the detected mi and the original mi overlap, we call the mi as “correctly detected mi”  <cit> . we then calculate the sensitivity  as the ratio of correctly detected mis over all detectable mis and positive predictive value  as the ratio of correctly detected mis over all detected mis.

as mentioned above, unmapped short reads have not been well studied by most existing tools including gustaf. however, it is very important for the analysis of personalized ngs data to study unmapped short reads so that we can exploit more sv information especially for mis. therefore, preprocessing of unmapped reads is needed. after running bwa to get unmapped short reads, we aligned unmapped reads to chr <dig> the same as what we did in mid, and then recorded the anchored alignment results for gustaf, including the re-aligned reads and the corresponding reference sequence on chr <dig>  afterwards the target regions from both re-aligned read and reference were used as the input for gustaf single-end detecting. for mid, we can directly run the whole pipeline with unmapped short reads discarded by bwa.

table  <dig> shows the comparison between mid and gustaf. note that the sub-datasets in 2x and 4x coverage are most similar to the real data we got from the 1kgp. the high sn and high ppv of mid in both dataset  <dig> and dataset  <dig> demonstrates high accuracy of mid in detecting mis, even with different variants around. gustaf demonstrates significantly lower sn and ppv in the simulated data. furthermore, lower standard deviation  of mid compared with gustaf in simulated data shows stable performance of mid. overall, mid outperforms gustaf in identifying mis.

identifying mis in  <dig> genomes project data
the 1kgp provides large number of individual human genomes data with ngs reads  <cit> . at present, 1kgp data has been widely used for sv detection by existing tools  <cit> . however, analysis on mis is still lacking. to detect mis, mid was applied on population-scale sequencing data from the 1kgp based on publicly released unmapped bam files  <cit> . by running mid with reference human genome assembly hg <dig>  mid reports the detailed alignment of each read containing mis and a list of unique mis detected. for a typical sample with a total number of  <dig>  m unmapped short reads , it takes 12 min to run mid with  <dig> cpu threads.

generally speaking, low coverage raises problems for mi detection since less support from reads may lead to unreliable results. however, many datasets from large-scale projects  are in low coverage. therefore, it is very useful to develop methods for identifying mis reliably and efficiently based on multiple low-coverage samples. it has been suggested that integrated analysis using multiple samples can be helpful in improving the reliability of sv detection  <cit> . we assessed the performance of mid on a total of  <dig> illumina samples from the 1kgp  <cit> , which have been categorized by different populations, and then integrated the results at the population level for more reliable and informative results. we eventually focused on  <dig> samples , in which mid reported at least one mi.

we calculated the number of unique mis and the number of reads supporting each mi first. in the following analysis, if not specified, the number of mis is equal to the number of unique mis, either in one particular sample or in one population. moreover, if one mi is supported by multiple reads, we calculate the number of reads containing the same mi as its “occurrence”. altogether, mid reported  <dig>  occurrences of  <dig> mis in  <dig> samples . of the  <dig> detected mis,  <dig> are intergenic,  <dig> mis are intronic, and  <dig> mis are exonic, including five mis overlapping with cds regions, seven mis overlapping with utr regions, two mis overlapping with both cds and utr regions, and the rest overlapping with mirna, mt_rrna etc. , annotated by gencode  <cit> . using encode annotations  <cit> , we identified  <dig> mis overlapping with proximal transcription factor binding sites , and  <dig> mis overlapping with distal tfbs following chip peaks of transcription factors. as many regulatory elements are in intronic regions  <cit> , plus the effect of mis extends beyond the inverted regions  <cit> , thus  <dig> mis found overlapping with introns, as well as  <dig> mis found locate within the  <dig>  bp upstream genomic regions of genes can also be informative for further analysis.

furthermore, the individual samples used by mid are categorized by populations, and populations are grouped by the predominant component of ancestry as follows: east asia , south asia , europe , america , and africa   <cit> . overall mid reported  <dig> mis in americas group,  <dig> mis in east asia group,  <dig> mis in south asia group,  <dig> mis in europe group, and  <dig> mis in africa group. table  <dig> presents the overview of mis detected in  <dig> individual samples, illustrating an average of  <dig>  individual samples supporting one mi, ~24 % of mis supported by at least two samples in the same population, and approximately 24 % of mis are supported by different populations in the same ancestry category. herein the results of mis supported by multiple reads, individual samples, and populations suggest that our method is probably informative and reliable with an integrated view of individual samples. in addition, additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows that the length of mis detected in 1kgp data is from 15 bp to 43 bp . as the majority of mis concentrate within the size range from 18 bp to 31 bp, we assume that the incidence of mi would be higher in this size, which might be helpful for understanding the mechanism of mi. furthermore, additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the distribution of number of mis across the human chromosomes, where the number of mis generally has positive correlation with the length of chromosomes except chr <dig> table  <dig> overview of mis detected in  <dig> individual samples from 1kgp

the “sam-num” column illustrates the number of samples for each category ; the “mi-num” column illustrates the number of different mis detected in each population or population group; the “mi-occ” column illustrates the sum of occurrences of mis in each population or population group; the “read-num” column illustrates the number of reads supporting mis. for the population lines, the “mul-sup” column illustrates the number of mis supported by at least two individual samples  in one population, the “ooc/num” column illustrates the ratio of mi occurrence over mi number, which indicates the average number of individual samples supporting one mi in the same population, and the “mul-sup/num” column illustrates the ratio of multiple samples supported mis over the number of all mis. for the population group lines , the “mul-sup” column illustrates the number of mis supported by at least two populations  in the same population group, the “ooc/num” column illustrates the ratio of mi occurrence over mi number, which indicates the average number of populations supporting one mi in the same population group, and the “mul-sup/num” column illustrates the ratio of multiple populations supported mis over the total number of mis. the last “read/num” column illustrates the ratio of the number of reads containing mis over the number of mis, which indicates the average number of reads supporting each mi



to focus on the exonic mis detected, we checked  <dig> mis overlapping with exons annotated by gencode. for instance, in fig. 1a, an mi overlaps with the 3’ utr of gene prepl and gene slc3a <dig>  which both have strong correlation with hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome  <cit> . this mi is supported by  <dig> individual samples across different populations, including two samples in east asian group,  <dig> samples in european group,  <dig> samples in americas group, and  <dig> samples in african group . the chimpanzee sequence in this location is almost identical to the sequence of neanderthal  and the mi we found, which suggests that the reference human genome is inverted in this region as compared to the most recent common ancestor of the human population. however, this mi was reported as multiple nucleotide variation  due to the poor understanding of mi  <cit> . thus our identification of mi can be helpful for understanding genomic variants. another mi changes  <dig> amino acids in the cds region of gene or51i <dig> . these amino acids are located on the fourth transmembrane domain facing the less conserved extracellular side comparing to the intracellular side, which might cause severe influence.fig.  <dig> mi examples in 1kgp data. a shows one mi supported by  <dig> samples which overlap with 3’ utr of gene prepl and slc3a; b shows the distribution of the mi supported by  <dig> samples in different populations; c shows one mi changing  <dig> amino acids of the exon in gene or51i1




application to ccle lung squamous cell carcinoma data
in addition to the 1kgp data, cancer genome sequencing data are widely available. a full understanding of somatic alterations in cancer genomes is important to better understand the genetic basis for cancer development  <cit> . of the whole ccle data, lung squamous cell carcinoma is a typical kind of lung cancer, which is a leading cause of death among all cancer patients  <cit> . in this work, we selected  <dig> wxs datasets of lung squamous cell carcinoma from ccle to provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of the applicability of mid to cancer sequencing data .

we found  <dig> mis overlapping with  <dig> genes . to be more specific, seven mis overlap with cds regions, one mi overlaps with one gene in cds regions and another gene in utr regions, and the rest locate in the cds nearby regions, which are annotated by gencode. moreover, three mis overlap with the proximal transcription factor binding sites  annotated by encode following chip peaks of transcription factors . we also found one mi within the  <dig>  bp upstream region of gene vps <dig>  in fig. 2a, we show that an mi breaks the edge of cds region and changes three amino acids of gene psrc <dig>  which encodes a proline-rich protein that is a target for regulation by the tumor suppressor protein p <dig>  in addition, fig. 2b presents an mi changing five amino acids of gene jmjd <dig> and overlapping with 5’utr of gene snap <dig>  while jmjd <dig> is a member of jmjc-domain-only family, which only contains the jmjc domain, and plays an important role in demethylation and involves in cancer diagnosis  <cit> . the variants and expression bias of genes in this family are related to cancer regulations, thus the change made by mi in the jmjd <dig> gene may help enrich the study of jmjd <dig> and related cancer diagnosis.fig.  <dig> mi examples in lung squamous cell carcinoma wxs data from ccle. a shows one mi breaking the edge of cds region and changing  <dig> amino acids of gene psrc <dig>  as well as an insertion next to the mi; b shows one mi changing  <dig> amino acids of gene jmjd <dig> and overlapping with 5’utr of gene snap47




discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
as presented above, upon test of the simulated data, mid has a steady performance of ppv for both low coverage and high coverage data, varying from 2x to 60x. significantly, mid demonstrates high ppv in simulated dataset with low coverage 2–4x, which is the same as the coverage range used by low coverage samples from the 1kgp. in fact, the reason of our method showing stable performance on low coverage data is that the identification process is designed based on the target regions of read and reference sequence, regardless of read depth. thus coverage bias has little influence in our method. by contrast, most existing tools require enough coverage to detect breakpoints, and only optimize good performance with high coverage data . however, during our anchoring approach, in which the bowtie program was called to make anchored alignment as preprocessing, higher coverage data can provide more detectable reads before identification process. therefore we will have more reads containing possible mis to be detected during identification, which means our strategy will benefit from higher coverage data. therefore, although mid performs well in low coverage data, it can also benefit from data with higher coverage.

in fact, the pipeline of mid contains preprocessing and sequence mapping process. during the preprocessing of mid, we did anchored alignment by calling bowtie. the reason we chose bowtie  <cit>  instead of the latest bowtie <dig>  <cit>  is that the length of paired-end reads  is shorter than 50 bp in ~100 bp ngs short reads, and bowtie outperforms bowtie <dig> in this size range, which is proved by our test and also claimed clearly in the tool clarification  <cit> . for sequence mapping, mid can handle small size mis and mis with multiple breakpoints, owing to the flexible segment mapping and scoring system during path finding. in existing tools such as bwa tool, although a number of discontinuous gaps and snvs might be detected, it is extremely difficult to identify more complex svs including inversions and duplications. in addition, more complicated scenario, i.e., mis with multiple breakpoints within the read, would hardly be taken into consideration by these tools. mid uses flexible segment mapping on both strands based on k-mers, which is more suitable for mi detection, especially for dealing with small mis and mis with multiple breakpoints around. the scoring process also helps confirm the final path and distinguish incorrect matches, including palindromic sequences, and mis as well.

in summary, we have developed a novel computational tool mid to identify mis by mapping initially unmapped short reads back onto human genome sequence. what makes mid different from other sv detecting tools is that our approach is sensitive to very small size mis, and capable of detecting mis with multiple breakpoints in one read due to flexible segment mapping process, as well as scoring system in distinguishing mis from palindromic sequence and other incorrect matches. the pipeline of mid can start from unmapped bam files and find the optimum solution automatically rather than parameter changing. to our knowledge, mid is the first method that can efficiently and reliably identify mis from unmapped short ngs reads. moreover, mid is reliable on low coverage data, which is suitable for large-scale projects such as the 1kgp. we realize that the mechanism and the function of mi, as a kind of sv , are still poorly understood. nevertheless, we expect that our tool would be useful to better understand mis and their roles in genetic diversity and diseases. in conclusion, mid is suitable for large-scale short reads produced by present high-throughput sequencing technologies , especially for low coverage data, and mid might have positive impact on identifying key genetic variants in human diseases with the further development of sequencing technologies.
