BACKGROUND
fusarium crown rot  is a chronic and serious disease of cereals. field surveys showed that f. pseudograminearum is the most prevalent pathogen for fcr in queensland and new south wales in australia but many different species of fusarium can cause this disease  <cit> . due most likely to the high intensity of cereal in cropping system combined with wider adoption of minimum tillage for moisture conservation, fcr has become more prevalent in many parts of the semiarid regions in recent years  <cit> . a survey in  <dig> found that fcr causes an estimated annual yield loss of $ <dig> million australia dollars in the wheat industry alone  <cit> . a study in the pacific northwest in usa showed that fcr could significantly reduce yield of both wheat and barley  <cit> . additionally, fcr infected plants could also produce mycotoxins in grains as well as other tissues. the presence of these compounds in food and feeds can be harmful for human and livestock  <cit> .

growing resistant varieties has long been recognised as an integral part in effectively managing fcr  <cit> . working toward the breeding of varieties resistant to this disease, sources of resistance were identified by germplasm screenings  <cit> . over the last decade, significant effort has also been made in identifying qtl conferring fcr resistance. several qtl have been detected from several different sources of resistance  <cit> . of the qtl reported so far, the one on 3bl consistently gave the largest effects and was identified from several genotypes . limited data indicates that the 3bl locus also confers field resistance to fcr and it reduces whitehead incidence significantly under field conditions  <cit> .

qtl mapping has become a routine procedure in locating genes controlling quantitative traits to specific genomic regions. however, qtl mapping has only limited resolution and markers obtained from such studies may not be reliably used in tagging the targeted loci  <cit> . the main reason why qtl mapping provides only limited resolution is due to the heterogeneity in genetic backgrounds in qtl mapping populations in regard to a targeted locus. some non-targeted traits segregating in the qtl mapping populations could interfere with the accurate phenotyping of a targeted trait thus lines containing the same allele may exhibit different levels of resistance. recent studies showed that both plant height and heading date have significant effects on fcr severity in both wheat and barley. lod values and magnitudes of qtl conferring fcr resistance were both reduced when the effect of height and heading date were accounted for by the covariance analysis . thus these traits need to be fixed in segregating populations which are suitable for developing markers tightly linked to a fcr locus.

fixing genetic backgrounds in regarding to a targeted locus can be achieved with near-isogenic lines   or populations generated from nils  <cit> . taken advantage of the newly released chromosome 3b pseudomolecule  <cit> , we used both nils  <cit>  and a nil-derived population in developing tightly linked markers to the large-effect fcr locus on 3bl and results obtained are reported in this paper.

RESULTS
twenty ssr markers selected from the existing linkage map  <cit>  for the qcrs.cpi-3b interval were assessed. nine of these markers detected polymorphism between isolines of the nine sets of nils used in this study. five of these markers  detected difference between the isolines for each of the nine nil sets. markers xcfp <dig> detected difference between isolines for eight of the nine nil sets and xgpw <dig> detected differences between the isolines for seven of the nine nil sets . based on their order in the linkage map of chromosome 3b  <cit> , xcfp <dig> and xgpw <dig> were tentatively selected as candidates flanking the qcrs.cpi-3b locus.fig.  <dig> map location of the fcr locus qcrs.cpi-3b based on data from the nine sets of near-isogenic lines  and based on the use of  <dig> nil-derived lines 



to determine the order of these ssr markers and confirm the results obtained from the nils, a subpopulation containing the first  <dig> lines of the fine mapping population were then analysed. disease ratings of this subpopulation fell into two classes, one ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the other from  <dig> to  <dig> . there were no intermediate rantings and all individuals could be placed in one of the two classes . the locus qcrs.cpi-3b was successfully placed within the interval flanked by xcfp <dig> and xgwm <dig> . assessing the whole fine mapping population of  <dig> lines with these two flanking markers identified  <dig> recombinants. aligning the two flanking markers against the 3b pseudomolecule  placed the distal marker xgwm <dig> at the position of  <dig> mbp and the proximal marker xcfp <dig> at the position of 160mbp. eighteen new markers were designed based on the 3b pseudomolecule targeting this interval. three of them  were polymorphic and they were all successfully mapped in the targeted interval . the targeted locus was mapped between marker cs3blcr- <dig> and cs3blcr- <dig> and the physical locations of these two flanking markers on the 3b pseudomolecule were at the positions  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  mbp, respectively. against this newly defined interval, another  <dig> markers were then designed based on the 3b pseudomolecule at a distance of about  <dig> mbp between two adjacent markers. four of these markers  detected polymorphism in the fine mapping population  and their placements on the linkage map reduced the fcr locus to a  <dig>  cm or  <dig> mbp interval flanked by cs3blcr- <dig> and xcfb <dig> .table  <dig> primers for new markers successfully mapped near the qcrs.cpi-3b locus#

to further define the fcr locus, the 3b pseudomolecule was used again to develop new markers for the targeted interval. sixty markers were designed in this third round of marker development with an average density of about  <dig>  mbp between the markers . seven of the  <dig> markers  detected polymorphism in the mapping population and they all co-segregated with the fcr locus .

CONCLUSIONS
fcr is a serious threat to cereal production in semi-arid areas worldwide and growing resistant varieties is an essential component in effectively managing the disease. working toward the breeding of resistant varieties, sources of resistance have been identified and several qtl controlling fcr have been reported. in the study reported here, we attempted to develop markers that can be reliably used to tag the fcr locus on 3bl. using markers developed from the chromosome 3b pseudomolecule, the large-effect qtl was successfully mapped to an interval of  <dig>  cm or  <dig>  mbp based on the nine sets of nils and a nil-derived population consisting of  <dig> lines. within this interval, seven markers co-segregating with the targeted locus were developed and  <dig> unique genes or contigs related to disease resistance were identified. these results should facilitate not only the incorporation of this locus into breeding programs but also the effort of cloning gene underlying the fcr locus.

the  <dig> markers mapped in this study covers a distance of  <dig>  cm . these markers covered a distance of  <dig>  cm in the linkage map reported previously  <cit> . it is known that recombination rates at meiosis can be affected by many factors. in addition to the relateness of the parental genotypes  <cit> , recombination frequencies can be regulated by major genes  <cit>  and may also differ between egg and pollen mother cells  <cit> . it is also well known that the presence of structural rearrangements between the parental genotypes can significantly reduce the recombination rates  <cit> . as the nils and the nil-derived population used for fine mapping in this study were all obtained from crosses between bread wheat  and t. spelta genotypes  <cit> , the relatively distant genetic relatedness between the parental genotypes likely contributed to the reduced linkage distances obtained in this study. a population significantly larger than the one used in this study is being produced and will be used to further define the targeted interval and identify the gene conferring fcr resistance at this locus.

the availability of the chromosome 3b pseudomolecule  <cit>  significantly facilitated the study reported here and there is no reason why the same approach can not be used to fine map genes of other traits on this chromosome. however, of the  <dig> pairs of primers designed in this study only  <dig> detected polymorphism and were successfully mapped in the targeted interval. this rate of success does not seem to be very high but could be even lower if populations generated from more closely related genotypes were used. the 3b pseudomolecule makes it feasible now to exploit a high-throughput genotyping approach in identifying genes controlling any trait on this chromosome. the one based on low-coverage whole genome resequencing  <cit>  is very appealing especially in considering that chromosome 3b is readily sortable by flow cytometry  <cit> .
