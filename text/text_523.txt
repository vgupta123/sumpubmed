BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium frequently encountered in the environment. naturally resistant to a wide range of antibiotics and disinfectants, this bacterium is commonly found in hospitals as a contaminant of cleaning solutions and even injectable material  <cit> . this bacterium is characterized by its very large genome, containing a large number of regulatory genes conferring a very high potential to adapt to environmental variation  <cit> . p. fluorescens is generally considered psychrotrophic species, but the presence of this bacterium in hospitals has long been demonstrated  <cit> . the broad clinical spectrum of this bacterium, which may colonize the airways  <cit> , urinary tract  <cit>  and blood  <cit>  of immunocompromised patients and previously healthy patients, demonstrates that human body temperature is not necessarily a barrier to the development of this microorganism. these findings strongly suggest that different strains have evolved to deal with this specific environment  <cit> . previous investigations of the infectious potential of p. fluorescens have demonstrated that this bacterium can bind specifically to the cytoplasmic membrane of neurons and glial cells  <cit> . attachment to the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell is associated with the induction of apoptosis and necrosis  <cit> . lps has clearly been implicated in cytotoxicity, but other factors released along with lps during cytoadhesion also seem to be essential for the virulence of this bacterium  <cit> . the virulence factors of pseudomonas aeruginosa and burkholderia sp. have been studied in detail, but little is known about those of p. fluorescens  <cit> . p. fluorescens bacteria synthesize and release various extracellular enzymes, including a protease  <cit>  and a lipase  <cit> , which may be involved in virulence. they also produce phospholipase c   <cit>  – an enzyme produced by many bacterial pathogens and associated with various levels of virulence  <cit> . the pathophysiological role of secreted plcs depends on bacterial species, extending from that of a major virulence factor to a minor metabolic factor involved in bacterial survival or dissemination only, without cytotoxic effects  <cit> . however, the effects of plcs may be more subtle. plc interferes with eukaryotic cellular signaling cascades and seems to be able to modulate the host immune response  <cit> . several members of the pseudomonas family produce plcs  <cit> , and the plcs synthesized by p. aeruginosa have been studied in detail  <cit> . the virulence potential of the plcs of this bacterium has often been associated with hemolytic activity  <cit> . conversely, our knowledge about hemolysin production by p. fluorescens remains very limited. the plcs identified in this species to date have essentially been studied biochemically, without considering their infectious potential.

we studied a recently identified strain of p. fluorescens   <cit>  with mesophilic behavior and hemolytic activity, comparing the cytotoxicity of the factors secreted by this clinical strain with those secreted by the environmental p. fluorescens strain mf <dig>  we also included the opportunistic pathogen p. aeruginosa in the study, as a reference. we identified a phospholipase c  from mfn <dig> and compared its amino-acid sequence with those of the plcs produced by other p. fluorescens species and other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. we then evaluated the involvement of plcc in the hemolytic activity of mfn <dig>  by constructing plcc mutants.

RESULTS
characterization of the mfn <dig> strain
mfn <dig> has been isolated from the sputum of a patient suffering from pneumonia. this bacterium has been characterized as p. fluorescens biovar i by polyphasic taxonomy, partial 16srna sequencing and siderotyping  <cit> . culturability studies demonstrated that this strain was able to grow  and formed biofilms on polystyrene at 37°c. as pao <dig>  this bacterium shown strong beta-hemolytic activity on sheep, horse or rabbit blood-agar plates , whereas strain mf <dig> was non-hemolytic. mfn <dig> also displayed lecithinase activity on egg-yolk agar plates .

cytotoxic effects of bacterial culture supernatants
we assessed the cytotoxicity of supernatants from p. fluorescens mfn <dig>  p. fluorescens mf <dig> and p. aeruginosa pao <dig> in two experimental models: ldh release from rat glial cells and the hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes in a liquid assay.

we first investigated cytotoxicity in rat glial cells in primary culture, a model previously used to assess the cytotoxicity of p. aeruginosa and p. fluorescens  <cit> . cell-free supernatants from stationary growth phase cultures were incubated overnight with primary cultures of rat glial cells. mfn <dig> and mf <dig> supernatants were much more cytotoxic than those from the opportunistic pathogen pao <dig> at all growth temperatures studied . mfn <dig> supernatants from bacteria grown at 17°c and 28°c were equally toxic , whereas those from bacteria grown at 8°c were loss toxic . mf <dig> also displayed significantly higher levels of secreted cytotoxic activity against glial cells than pao <dig> grown at 17°c or 28°c. this activity was clearly temperature-dependent, and was maximal at 17°c.

we monitored the levels of secreted hemolytic activity displayed by mfn <dig> throughout bacterial growth. mfn <dig> grown at 17°c displayed hemolytic activity only at the start of the stationary phase and similar profiles were observed at 8°c and 28°c. the kinetics of hemolysin production by pao <dig> was investigated only at 37°c. hemolytic activity appeared to be stable after  <dig> bacterial generations in culture, in all the cases. these conditions were therefore adopted in all subsequent studies. major differences were observed in the hemolytic activities of supernatants from cultures of mfn <dig>  mf <dig> and pao <dig> grown at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 37°c . culture supernatants from mf <dig> grown at  <dig>   <dig> and 28°c were non hemolytic . hemolysis levels for the clinical strain mfn <dig> were maximal at growth temperatures of  <dig> and 17°c , and lower at 28°c . mfn <dig> supernatants were non hemolytic if the bacteria were cultured at 37°c. mfn <dig> and pao <dig> supernatants had similar hemolytical potentials if the bacteria were grown at 17°c  or 28°c  . the hemolytic activity of pao <dig> supernatants was maximal at growth temperatures of 37°c  and 17°c. by contrast, the secreted hemolytic activity of the mfn <dig> strain was not maximal at the optimal growth rate for this strain .

as the p. fluorescens clinical strain mfn <dig> displayed hemolysis, we investigated the factors potentially involved in this hemolytic activity.

measurement of protease activity, lps and biosurfactant release and lecithinase activity in the supernatant
no protease activity or lps release  into the supernatants of mf <dig>  mfn <dig> and pao <dig> cultured in lb medium at 28°c was detected . we used egg yolk as a substrate for estimating plc activity and biosurfactant release was assessed with the drop-collapse test. both lecithinase activity and biosurfactant were detected in these three culture supernatants, although higher levels were observed for mfn <dig> and pao <dig> than for mf <dig> .

effect of d <dig> on the secreted hemolytic activity of mfn1032
we investigated the possible involvement of a secreted plc in the hemolytic activity of mfn <dig> using d <dig>  which specifically inhibits certain plcs  <cit> . supernatants from mfn <dig> were incubated at room temperature for  <dig> h with d <dig> at a final concentration of  <dig> mm, and their hemolytic activity was then assessed. incubation with d <dig> decreased hemolytic activity by 68% . thus, a phospholipase c sensitive to d <dig> is clearly involved in the hemolytic activity of mfn <dig>  by contrast, d <dig> treatment did not decrease the hemolytic activity of pao <dig> supernatants, consistent with previous results  <cit> .

structural characterization of the plc from mfn1032
sds-page and zymograms were used to determine the apparent molecular mass of an enzyme with lecithinase activity. a single band with lecithinase activity was recovered from a silver-stained sds-page gel placed on an egg-yolk agar plate . this protein had a molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda. we designed pcr primers based on the gene encoding a plc of similar molecular mass described by preuss et al. and produced by an uncharacterized p. fluorescens strain  <cit> . a single fragment of  <dig>  kb was obtained and cloned with the pmos kit. this fragment was sequenced by genome express  and the sequence registered in the genbank database  named plcc. this sequence encodes a predicted plcc protein of  <dig> residues, with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda. these findings are consistent with sds-page and suggest that the protein is secreted without cleavage. in silico analysis indicated the absence of any known secretion signal sequence. no gene amplification was obtained if the same primers were used with mf <dig> and pao <dig> .

a search of the ncbi nucleotide and protein database showed that the plc from mfn <dig>  was very similar to putative plcs from other strains of p. fluorescens . the molecular mass of this group of plcs ranges from  <dig> kda to  <dig> kda. plcc is clearly related to the plc described by preuss et al. , which was produced by a p. fluorescens strain isolated as a contaminant of placental extract of unknown origin. these two plcs are also very similar to a putative plc encoded by the p. fluorescens sbw <dig> genome , but are more distantly related to the putative plcs identified for the pf- <dig> strain – a rhizosphere strain of p. fluorescens  – and pf0- <dig> . sequence identity was also observed with putative plcs from the entomopathogen pseudomonas entomophila  and from legionella pneumophila, although the level of identity was lowers . no significant similarity was observed with the plcs produced by p. aeruginosa  or with the pc-plc from b. cereus .

ns: not significant

construction of mfn <dig> plcc mutants
the mfn <dig> strain, a clone of mfn <dig> that overexpresses plcc, was obtained by electroporating mfn <dig> with pucp <dig>  which carries the plcc gene and its promoter . the expression of plcc from this plasmid was under the control of the constitutive plac promoter. we investigated the involvement of plcc in hemolytic activity by culturing mfn <dig> at 17°c and 28°c and assessing its hemolytic activity in liquid assays. mfn <dig> was significantly more cytotoxic  than the parental strain mfn <dig>  . we used a plcc-deficient mutant, mfn <dig>  to determine whether plcc contributed to the hemolytic activity of mfn <dig>  we detected no hemolysis with mfn <dig> culture supernatants, regardless of growth temperature . complementation of the plcc mutation with pmf <dig>  did not restore the hemolytic phenotype of mfn <dig> , whereas it did result in levels of lecithin degradation on egg-yolk agar plates similar to those for the wild-type strain.

sds-page analysis of total extracellular proteins followed by plcc zymogram detection on egg-yolk agar plates showed that there was no plcc in the supernatant of cultures of the plcc-deficient mutant mfn <dig>  as no lecithin degradation was observed . the mutant released smaller amounts of an approximately  <dig> kda protein than did mfn <dig> . analysis of the amino-acid sequence of the n-terminus of this protein  suggested that it was a homolog of the flagellin protein flic produced by p. aeruginosa and p. putida. the plcc-complemented strain mfn <dig> displayed wild-type levels of lecithin degradation in zymogram analysis and a partial restoration of flagellin levels . mfn <dig> had an electrophoretic profile identical to that of mfn <dig>  except for the  <dig> kda protein previously identified as plcc, which was produced in larger amounts by mfn <dig> .

pleiotropic effects of plcc gene mutation
flagellin levels in the supernatant of the plcc-deficient strain mfn <dig> were low. we therefore investigated the motility of the mfn <dig> and the plcc mutants. in swimming conditions , mfn <dig> completely invaded the plate over the course of a  <dig> h incubation at 28°c and displayed swarming motility, whereas mfn <dig> displayed only swimming motility and diffused less . this may be due to higher levels of biosurfactant release or production, than observed for the wild-type strain, as suggested by the translucent appearance of the halo on the plates. this hypothesis was confirmed by the drop-collapse test . the plcc-deficient mutant mfn <dig> and the complemented strain mfn <dig>  had swimming motility patterns similar to those of mfn <dig> , but did not produce biosurfactant on lb agar plates, as shown by the drop-collapse test . in motility assays on lb plates containing  <dig> % agar, mfn <dig> and mfn <dig> had no swarming motility and no movement was observed even after  <dig> h of growth at 28°c, whereas mfn <dig> continued to be motile .

+: detection; -: no detection

the loss of biosurfactant production may be enough, in itself, to account for the loss of swarming motility of the plcc-deficient strain, but cannot account for the low levels of flagellin release. electron microscopy analyses of mfn <dig> and mfn <dig> cells showed that the wild-type strain had a single polar flagellum whereas the plcc-deficient strain mfn <dig> displayed a hyperflagellated phenotype, with most of the cells presenting three polar flagella . no difference in flagellum size was observed, but these differences in flagellation would probably affect the properties of the two strains. mfn <dig> cells formed aggregates on the grid, whereas mfn <dig> cells did not, despite having been prepared in the same conditions. adhesion was evaluated by analyzing biofilm formation on polystyrene microarrays at 37°c. we found that mfn <dig> had a greater capacity to form biofilms than the wild-type strain .

analysis of the flanking regions of plcc
we investigated the genomic organization of the genes encoding plcs in the genomes of p. fluorescens pf0- <dig> and pf <dig>  we identified two genes of unknown function in the operon containing the plc gene in pf0- <dig>  and one in pf <dig> . we found no other gene in an operon with plcc in mfn <dig>  confirming that the pleiotropic effects of plcc disruption could not be due to a polar mutation. no gene encoding a potential flagellin or belonging to the flagellar regulon were found in the surrounding region. a gene encoding a putative dihydropycolinate synthase was found in the 5' flanking region of plcc, in an antisense orientation. in the 3' region, a similar phenomenon was observed, except that the gene encoded a putative transcriptional regulator of the gntr family  <cit> . this regulator is probably involved in plcc expression because the consensus gntr binding site -ac.a), as identified by rigali et al.  <cit> , is present in the sequence immediately upstream from the plcc gene.

discussion
p. fluorescens is generally considered to be non pathogenic, but its infectious potential has nonetheless been demonstrated. in vitro studies of environmental strains, including p. fluorescens mf <dig>  have shown that this psychrotrophic bacterium has most of the features of an opportunistic pathogen  <cit> . p. fluorescens is a highly heterogeneous species, ranging from avirulent strains that can be used in crop protection  <cit>  to clinical strains involved in lung, urinary tract and blood infections. however, whereas the low virulence of industrial strains has been studied in detail, the factors involved in the virulence of clinical forms of p. fluorescens, including mfn <dig>  have not previously been investigated. virulence results from the combined effects of direct contact between the bacterium and the target cell and the production of many soluble or secreted molecules and exotoxins acting at some distance from the microorganism. mfn <dig> has been shown to be highly cytotoxic in vitro to eukaryotic cells, to which it binds  <cit> . we investigated the role of factors secreted by this bacterium in cytotoxicity. we therefore carried out experiments with supernatants and culture medium extracts only.

in addition to its ability to multiply at 37°c, which is itself unusual for a strain of p. fluorescens, mfn <dig> generated molecules with high levels of hemolytic and cytotoxic activity, as observed in in vitro models. the hemolytic activity of mfn <dig> supernatants was similar to that of p. aeruginosa, which is an opportunistic pathogen. by contrast, a typical psychrotrophic strain, mf <dig>  displayed no hemolytic activity under the same conditions. more surprisingly, mfn <dig> supernatants were significantly more cytotoxic to rat glial cells than pao <dig> supernatants, for bacteria grown at 17°c and 28°c. the secreted hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of p. fluorescens mfn <dig> and p. aeruginosa pao <dig> appeared to be temperature-dependent, as was p. fluorescens mf <dig> cytotoxicity. surprisingly, the supernatant of mfn <dig> grown at 37°c displayed no hemolysis. at first glance, this finding appears to contradict the hypothesis that hemolysis is a virulence factor. low temperature induction likely reflects the evolutionary history of the factors involved in this activity and the function of those elements in non-infective conditions. in fact, it has been described that pseudomonas aeruginosa from clinical and non-clinical environments are genetically and functionally similar  <cit> . so evolution of virulence determinants in opportunistic pathogens is not necessary linked to their interaction with the human host. finally, invasin and the heat-stable enterotoxin yst from y. enterocolitica are also virulence factors produced preferentially at temperatures below 37°c in vitro. however, in conditions of slight acidity or high osmolarity, these virulence genes are expressed at 37°c in vitro. high-temperature repression may therefore be overcome by other conditions stimulating expression in the host.

we found that neither protease nor lps was responsible for the extracellular hemolytic activity of mfn <dig>  the absence of protease activity in these conditions was not surprising, as protease activity has been recovered from p. aeruginosa pao <dig> only after at least  <dig> h of growth in lb medium and has never been observed with p. fluorescens mf <dig> in this medium  <cit> . many pathogens display secreted hemolytic activity, which may be due to toxins, biosurfactants, and/or enzymes   <cit> . various species of pseudomonas have been reported to produce hemolytic and/or non hemolytic plcs  <cit> . the observed degradation of lecithin by mf <dig> on plates or in supernatants is consistent with this bacterium producing a non hemolytic plc other than plcc, as no gene amplification was observed with plcc primers. by contrast, the plc produced by mfn <dig> is involved in the hemolytic activity of this strain, as shown by the inhibitory effect of d <dig> 

a protein with lecithinase activity was identified in mfn <dig> supernatants by an egg-yolk agar plate zymogram method. this enzyme has a molecular mass of  <dig> kda, as determined by sds-page. this apparent molecular mass is similar to that of previously described p. fluorescens plc enzymes  <cit>  and those of the putative plcb  <cit>  and plca produced by p. aeruginosa . the plch and plcn produced by p. aeruginosa have a higher molecular mass  <cit> .

analysis of the sequence of the plcc gene indicated considerable similarity between plcc and putative plcs identified in various strains of p. fluorescens including, in particular, the plc produced by a p. fluorescens isolated from placental extract  <cit>  and the putative plc from sbw <dig>  this plcc gene was shorter than those predicted for pf0- <dig> and pf <dig>  and the main difference between the protein encoded by this gene and pf0- <dig> and pf <dig> concerned the n-terminus of the protein. it is unclear whether plc genes are expressed in the other strains and it is possible that plc production is not specific to adaptation to human infection but was acquired to survive in other environments.

no significant sequence similarity was found between the group of plcs described here and the well characterized zinc-metallophospholipases c of gram-positive bacteria. this group of plcs is also only very distantly related to the enzymes described by stonehouse et al., including the plch and plcn of p. aeruginosa  <cit> . the differences between these enzymes concern not only their sequences, but also their catalytic sites, as d <dig> has no effect on plch activity  <cit> . the plcc from mfn <dig> also appears to be different from pao <dig> plcb and plca  <cit> . thus, although p. fluorescens and p. aeruginosa are generally thought to be closely related, they have different plcs. preuss et al. reported an elegant, detailed biochemical characterization of their plc. their data concerning iron requirement and d <dig> susceptibility suggested the existence of a new class of plcs, to which mfn <dig> plcc might belong.

neither plcc nor the plc studied by preuss et al. has a signal peptide. these enzymes are therefore presumably secreted by an unknown mechanism, whereas most plcs are secreted by the tat or sec pathways  <cit> . several phospholipases have been reported to belong to the flagellar regulon  <cit>  and to be secreted by the flagellar export apparatus  <cit> , a type-three secretion system  <cit> , or by the two-partner secretion  system  <cit> . for example, the transcription and secretion of ypla, the phospholipase a <dig> of yersinia enterocolitica, are controlled by the flagellar regulon  <cit> . warren et al. suggested that an amino-terminal secretion signal of about  <dig> amino acids is required for ypla secretion, but did not identify a particular signal peptide motif  <cit> . some plcs have been shown to be regulated by the flagellar regulon, but no evidence has ever been published to suggest that plcs may affect the expression of this regulon. there is no evidence to suggest that the plcc of mfn <dig> is secreted by the flagellar apparatus, but the lower levels of flagellin in the supernatant of the plcc-deficient mutant than in the supernatant of the control or complemented strain implies a close link between these two proteins. this hypothesis is supported by in silico analysis, which identified a cluster of orthologous groups  corresponding to a flagellar hook motif in plcc. it should be noted that the lower levels of flagellin do not indicate the lack of flagella. the mutant displayed swimming motility and tem observations of mfn <dig> cells confirmed that flagella were present.

we constructed a plcc-overexpressing mutant of mfn <dig>  mfn <dig>  to investigate the involvement of plcc in hemolytic activity and we found that a higher level of plcc production by mfn <dig> was associated with higher levels of hemolytic activity. the loss of hemolytic activity in the plcc-deficient strain mfn <dig> confirmed the involvement of this enzyme in hemolysis. hemolytic activity was not restored in the mfn <dig> strain, which overexpressed plcc, and extinction of the plcc gene had also pleiotropic effects, particularly as concerns the release of biosurfactant and flagellin. this was not due to a polar mutation involving plcc gene interruption, as the plcc gene was not associated with any other gene in an operon in the mfn <dig> genome. linares et al. described that the presence of low antibiotics concentrations in the culture media may induce changes in bacterial physiology   <cit> . their data could explain the phenotype change of the plcc mutant mfn <dig>  but we were not in conditions used by these authors . we probably disturb a complex regulatory network in mfn <dig>  and this hypothesis is also supported by plcc overexpression in mfn <dig> resulting in the overproduction of biosurfactants, increasing swarming mobility.

such complex regulatory systems often involve positive and/or negative feedback loops  <cit> . gntr regulators have been reported to maintain their own expression  <cit> , so a positive feedback loop regulating gntr levels may exist. as previously reported, a simple change affecting a key element of this kind of system might lead to epigenetic modification  <cit> . epigenetic switches, corresponding to phenotype modifications, arise and may be transmitted from a cell to its progeny in the absence of genetic modifications. this type of regulation has been reported for the cytotoxicity associated with the t3ss  of p. aeruginosa. transient expression of the exsa transcriptional regulator in non inducible strains leads to the acquisition of a cytotoxic phenotype  <cit> . the artificial extinction of plcc in mfn <dig> may have triggered such an epigenetic switch.

CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that some p. fluorescens strains have some of the key characteristics of opportunistic pathogens. we provide the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of the involvement of a plc in the secreted hemolytic activity of a clinical strain of p. fluorescens . we found that mfn <dig> secretes a phospholipase c homologous to a plc from an uncharacterized p. fluorescens strain previously studied biochemically by preuss. this enzyme belongs to a new group unrelated to the plcs produced by p. aeruginosa and seems to be produced by a wide range of p. fluorescens strains, although no homolog of the plcc gene was found in our model strain, mf <dig>  further studies including strains of different origins presenting hemolytic activity would clarify these observations. however, although plcc is not specific to clinical isolates, this enzyme is a potential virulence factor as our data show that this enzyme is directly involved in the secreted hemolytic activity of mfn <dig>  as demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of d <dig>  the direct involvement of plcc in mfn <dig> virulence could be further demonstrated or excluded by studying in vivo models.

results obtained with the plcc mutants also suggest that this enzyme interferes with biosurfactant production, which might also account for the higher levels of hemolysis observed when plcc was overexpressed. the pleiotropic phenotype resulting from plcc mutation or overexpression suggests that plcc is involved in a regulatory network. we are now investigating a possible role for the 3' flanking region of plcc, corresponding to the putative transcriptional regulator gntr, with the aim of determining the link between plcc, gntr and biosurfactant production.
