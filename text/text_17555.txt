BACKGROUND
human t cell leukemia virus type  <dig>  causes adult t cell leukemia , a severe and fatal lymphoproliferative disease of helper t cells  <cit> , and a separate neurodegenerative disease called tropical spastic paraparesis/htlv-1-associated myelopathy   <cit> . htlv- <dig> encodes a 40 kda regulatory protein, tax, which is necessary and sufficient for cellular transformation and is, therefore, considered to be the viral oncoprotein. tax is a potent activator of both viral and cellular gene expression, and the oncogenic potential of tax is thought to depend on its ability to alter the expression of cellular genes involved in cell growth and proliferation, and its direct interactions with cell cycle regulators  <cit> . tax-mediated transcriptional activation of cellular gene expression requires direct contact with components of the cyclic amp-response element binding protein , nuclear factor-κb , and the serum response factor  signaling pathways  <cit> . moreover, tax is thought to be involved in other cellular processes including dna repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis  <cit> .

tax stimulates cell growth via cell cycle dysregulation  <cit> . a major mitogenic activity of tax is stimulation of the g1-to-s-phase transition  <cit> , and several different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the dysregulation of the g <dig> phase and the accelerated progression into s phase. in mammalian cells, g <dig> progression is controlled by the sequential activation of the cyclin-dependent kinases  cdk <dig>  cdk <dig>  and cdk <dig>  activation of these cdks by tax leads to hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma  and the liberation of e2f, which is essential for cell cycle progression  <cit> . tax interacts with cyclins d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig>  but not with cdk <dig> or cdk <dig>  <cit> . by binding to cyclins, tax stabilizes the cyclin d/cdk complex, thereby enhancing its kinase activity and leading to the hyperphosphorylation of rb. moreover, tax activates the transcription of cyclin d <dig> and d <dig>  <cit>  by deregulating the nf-κb pathway  <cit> . by contrast, there is evidence that tax induces cell cycle arrest at the g <dig> phase  <cit> . htlv- <dig> infection and tax expression in human cells have been observed to induce cell cycle arrest at the g <dig> phase by inducing p27/kip <dig> and p21/waf <dig>  <cit> , and the sharp rise in p <dig> induced by tax is often associated with premature activation of the anaphase-promoting complex   <cit> . indeed, cells infected with htlv- <dig> expressing wild-type tax arrest at the g1/s boundary when subjected to cellular stress  <cit> .

interestingly, tax induces apoptosis in a variety of systems  <cit> , consistent with its ability to inhibit dna repair. indeed, htlv-1-infected cells undergo increased apoptosis upon cellular stress  <cit> ; however, other reports show that tax inhibits apoptosis  <cit> , supporting its role as a transforming protein and an inducer of t cell proliferation. therefore, it seems likely that tax is capable of stimulating both pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways.

tax regulates cell cycle progression and apoptosis both positively and negatively; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of these processes by tax remain obscure. in this study, we examined the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis by tax and demonstrated the following:  a high level of transient tax expression arrests the cell cycle at the g <dig> phase and induces apoptosis in hela cells;  based on a microarray containing approximately  <dig>  human mrna transcripts, genes related to cell cycle progression and apoptosis were deregulated by tax in hela cells;  time-lapse imaging of a fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator  in hela cells allows for dual-color imaging and can be used to distinguish between live cells in the g <dig> and s/g2/m phases. using this system for the in vivo analysis of the spatial and temporal patterns of cell cycle dynamics  <cit> , we demonstrated that tax-expressing cells arrest in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle and proceeded to apoptosis; and  we found that tax-induced changes in the expression of genes related to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis correlated well with the morphological changes observed in the cells.

RESULTS
tax induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in transfected hela cells
to examine whether tax induces cell cycle arrest at the g <dig> phase and promotes apoptosis in hela cells, chimeric tax carrying a flag tag at the carboxyl terminus was transfected into hela cells. at 24 h post transfection, the expression of tax protein was assessed by immunoblot analysis of cell extracts using the monoclonal antibody  m <dig>  which recognizes the flag tag . a single band with an apparent molecular mass consistent with the predicted sequences was observed. as shown in figure 1b, tax was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected hela cells. this result correlates well with previous studies indicating that tax is able to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm but predominantly localizes in the nucleus  <cit> . as shown in figure 1c, tax showed considerable transactivation activity toward the htlv- <dig> enhancer, indicating that chimeric tax with a c-terminal flag tag was fully functional.

next, the cell cycle distribution of tax-expressing hela cells was analyzed. cells were stained with propidium iodide  and analyzed by flow cytometry 48 h after co-transfection with the tax expression vector or the control vector and a green fluorescence protein  expression vector, pegfp-n <dig>  which served as a marker plasmid. the histograms show representative data from one of three independent experiments. as shown in figure 1d, flow cytometry analysis revealed that there was a marked increase in the percentage of cells in the g <dig> phase in cells transfected with tax  compared with cells transfected with the control vector , strongly indicating that g <dig> cell cycle arrest was induced in tax-expressing cells . to confirm this result, total cell extracts were collected 48 h post-transfection and the phosphorylation status of rb was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-rb mab, which detects all forms of rb. the phosphorylation status of rb serves as a marker of cells in the g0/g <dig> phase of the cell cycle, since rb is progressively phosphorylated throughout the g <dig> phase and is hyperphosphorylated upon transition into the s phase  <cit> . as shown in figure 1e, hyperphosphorylated form  migrated more slowly than the hypo- and unphosphorylated forms . the majority of rb was hyperphosphorylated  in cells transfected with the control vector; however, a decrease in the level of hyperphosphorylated form  and an increase in the levels of hypo- and/or unphosphorylated form  were observed in extracts prepared from tax-expressing cells. these results confirmed that tax prevents hyperphosphorylation of rb and blocks cell cycle progression at the g <dig> phase.

to analyze whether tax induced apoptosis, hela cells were transfected with a tax expression vector or a control vector, and the activity of caspase- <dig>  which plays an essential role in apoptosis, was measured. caspase- <dig> activity was significantly higher in tax-expressing cells than in control cells . next, the apoptotic activity of tax was further quantified using flow cytometry by co-staining transfected cells with phycoerythrin -annexin v and 7-amino-actinomycin d  . a prominent event in early apoptosis is the exposure of phosphatidylserine  on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. cell surface-exposed ps is specifically detected by pe-annexin v, and during the late stages of apoptosis or necrosis, cell membrane integrity is lost, allowing entry of the dna-binding dye 7-aad. the population of annexin v-positive and 7-aad-negative apoptotic cells was much higher in tax-expressing cells  than in cells transfected with the control vector . because the same trends were observed for caspase- <dig> activity  and apoptotic activity , it was concluded that tax induces apoptosis in hela cells.

large-scale expression profiling of cellular genes after transfection with tax
to analyze the mechanism underlying the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis by tax, total rna was isolated from hela cells transfected with tax or a control vector, and each rna sample was subjected to microarray analysis . data sets were analyzed using genespring gx  <dig>  software for gene expression, clustering, gene ontology, and significant signaling pathways. using microarrays containing approximately  <dig>  mrna transcripts,  <dig> genes were identified  that showed statistically significant levels of differential regulation by tax  .

the upregulated genes  were clustered within functional groups involved in transcription/translation/rna processing, signal transduction, the immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cell growth/proliferation . in addition, a number of molecules involved in the immune response were significantly downregulated by tax .

tax induces the expression of genes related to cell cycle progression and apoptosis
it was hypothesized that changes in gene expression may provide valuable information about the dysregulation of cell cycle progression induced by tax and about how tax might affect the genes relevant to this process. as shown in figure 2a, of  <dig> genes related to cell cycle progression that were regulated by tax, five were downregulated and  <dig> were upregulated . genes associated with mitosis , including the mitotic cell cycle checkpoint  and mitotic centrosome separation , were repressed by tax. by contrast, genes upregulated by tax were functionally classified as genes related to the cell cycle . many of these genes are also involved in other processes, such as the response to stress , the response to dna damage , map kinase activity , cell proliferation , and negative regulation of the cell cycle . genes such as smad <dig>  gadd45b, and dusp <dig> were also identified as having a role in apoptosis, and il <dig> is additionally involved in inflammation and the immune response.

the microarray results for genes related to cell cycle progression were validated by performing real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  on five upregulated genes . the results of the qrt-pcr agreed with those obtained by microarray analysis.

next, tax-regulated genes related to apoptosis were identified . the microarray results revealed that  <dig> pro- or anti-apoptotic genes were regulated by tax . two genes associated with the induction of apoptosis, card <dig> and bclaf <dig>  were downregulated by tax. the majority of the genes upregulated by tax were involved in apoptosis. furthermore, several of these genes also function in the immune response . interestingly, several highly upregulated genes, such as ier <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  birc <dig> and il <dig>  have both pro- and anti-apoptotic functions. in contrast, the highly upregulated gene, tnfrsf <dig>  is pro-apoptotic only. tnf and tnf receptor family genes were also found to be upregulated by tax in this study.

to confirm and extend the results of the microarray experiments, expression of the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes regulated by tax was measured by qrt-pcr using specific primers. genes upregulated in the microarray were also upregulated in qrt-pcr , although there were small differences in the levels measured by the two methods. for example, the expression levels of birc <dig> and il <dig> measured by qrt-pcr were almost twice that measured by microarray analysis, and the expression level of the apoptosis inductor tnfrsf <dig> was more than three times higher by qrt-pcr than by microarray. despite these minor differences, overall gene expression levels measured by qrt-pcr were similar to those measured by microarray analysis.

visualizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis by tax
to clarify whether tax causes apoptosis independently of its ability to induce g <dig> arrest, the spatiotemporal patterns of cell cycle regulation in response to tax expression were monitored in hela/fucci <dig> cells  <cit> . this system was chosen because it allows dual-color imaging, in which g1-phase nuclei are labeled orange and s/g2/m-phase nuclei are labeled green. a fluorescent tax vector was constructed that allows the identification of tax-expressing hela/fucci <dig> cells. this vector contained tax, an internal ribosomal entry site , cyan fluorescent protein , and a flag sequence at the 3’ end of tax. the vector was expressed in hela cells, and tax-expressing cells were stained with an anti-flag mab followed by an alexa fluor  <dig> secondary antibody . as shown in figure 3a, all tax-expressing cells were cfp-positive .

hela/fucci <dig> cells were plated on a glass coverslip, transiently transfected with tax-ires-cfp or the cfp control vector, and then incubated for 24 h. next, fields containing orange, green, and blue fluorescence were selected and images were acquired using an olympus lcv <dig> imaging system . the proliferation of control hela/fucci <dig> cells was evidenced by the fraction of cells at g <dig> phase with orange nuclei, the fraction of cells at s/g2/m phase with green nuclei, and the subsequent change in the fluorescence of these cells , which indicated that the cells progressed normally through the cell cycle. at 24 h post-transfection, all hela/fucci <dig> cells expressing tax-ires-cfp, which resulted in blue fluorescence, also had orange nuclei, indicating that they were in g <dig> phase . during the culture period, hela/fucci <dig> cells expressing tax-ires-cfp did not progress to s/g2/m phase, as evidenced by the presence of orange nuclei and the absence of green nuclei in tax-expressing cells . additionally, a marked decrease was observed in the proportion of tax-ires-cfp-expressing cells in s/g2/m phase compared with control cells expressing cfp alone , indicating that tax arrests cells at the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle.

interestingly, overexpression of tax appeared to reduce the number of hela/fucci <dig> cells in culture . moreover, apoptosis was assessed by the appearance of rounded cells after an increase in the number of tax-expressing cells at g <dig> phase, starting at 36 h post-transfection . at 72 h post transfection, there was a notable reduction in the overall number of cells, as well as in the percentage of tax-expressing cells .

expression kinetics of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis that are altered following induction of tax protein
to analyze the correlation between the expression of genes related to cell cycle regulation  and apoptosis   with the dynamics of cell cycle and apoptosis , total rna was prepared at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h after transfection of hela cells with tax or a control vector. each rna sample was then subjected to qrt-pcr. as indicated in figure  <dig>  the expression levels of smad <dig>  gadd45a and gadd45b in tax-transfected cells began to increase from 6 h post-transfection and reached a peak at 24 h, decreasing again by 36 h. in the case of il <dig>  cdkn1a and il <dig> in tax-expressing cells, the expression levels reached a peak at 24 h, decreased at 36 h, and then increased again at 48 h.

the kinetics and results from time-lapse imaging indicate that marked upregulation of il <dig>  smad <dig>  cdkn1a, gadd45a, gadd45b and il <dig> at 24 h post-transfection was well correlated with a notable reduction in the number of tax-expressing cells and an increase of tax-expressing cells in the g <dig> phase.

discussion
this study used large-scale host cell gene profiling with human cdna microarrays and time-lapse imaging of hela/fucci <dig> cells to monitor the dynamics of tax-induced cell death. three major conclusions can be drawn from the data:  tax induces cell cycle arrest at the g <dig> phase in hela cells as assessed by flow cytometry. this result was confirmed by the accumulation of hypo- and/or unphosphorylated form of rb in tax-expressing cells. moreover, analysis of annexin v-stained cells and caspase- <dig> activity clearly demonstrated that tax promotes apoptosis. thus, a high level of transiently-expressed tax can arrest the cell cycle at the g <dig> phase and induce apoptosis in hela cells.  the most interesting aspect of this study was visualizing the morphological dynamics of tax-induced cell death after cell cycle arrest at the g <dig> phase. time-lapse imaging of hela/fucci <dig> cells showed that tax-induced apoptosis was dependent on the ability of tax to induce g <dig> arrest.  microarray data revealed that tax induced gene expression changes in hela cells;  <dig> tax-dependent genes were found to be related to cell cycle regulation and  <dig> to apoptosis .  the kinetics of gene expression identified that tax-induced changes in the expression of il <dig>  smad <dig>  cdkn1a, gadd45a, gadd45b and il <dig> closely correlated with the morphological changes of the cell cycle and apoptosis observed by time-lapse imaging. since these genes are related not only to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induction, but also to stress kinase pathways, the present study suggests that tax may induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by activating genes related to stress-response signaling pathways.

many studies show that the tax oncoprotein accelerates g <dig> progression  <cit>  and is capable of stimulating anti-apoptotic signaling pathways  <cit> . in contrast, the present study showed that tax arrests cells at g <dig>  thereby inducing apoptosis. our results consist with previous results obtained using hela cells and supt <dig> cells  <cit> . there may be possible explanations for how tax induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. one interesting finding from our microarray analysis was the marked activation of stress kinase pathways induced by tax. in mammalian cells, two families of stress-responsive mapks, c-jun n-terminal kinase  and p <dig>  are activated by stimuli such as uv radiation, oxidative stress and translation inhibitors, as well as by inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor α , and transforming growth factor β . these signaling pathways promote apoptosis, cell survival, cell cycle arrest, inflammation and differentiation  <cit> . interestingly, microarray analysis revealed that genes such as smad <dig> and smad <dig>  which are the principal intracellular effectors of the tgfβ family  <cit> ; gadd45a and gadd45b, which are implicated as stress sensors and activated by tgfβ in a smad-dependent manner  <cit> ; dusp <dig>  dusp <dig>  dusp <dig> and dusp <dig>  which are stress-inducible map kinase phosphatases  <cit> ; map kinase kinase kinase  <dig>   <cit> ; jun  <cit> , which is the effector transcription factor of the jnk pathway; and il <dig>  il <dig> and fas, which are inflammatory cytokines, were all upregulated by tax. these genes, expressed in response to tax, are mediators of jnk and p <dig> activity. in addition, we found that the kinetics of altered expression of several genes related to pathways involving stress-responsive mapks were closely correlated with the kinetics of the spatial and temporal patterns of cell cycle dynamics analyzed in time-lapse imaging. at 24 h post-transfection with tax expression vectors, the genes for il <dig>  smad <dig>  cdkn1a, gadd45a, gadd45b and il <dig> were significantly upregulated  and the number of tax-ires-cfp-expressing cells were in g <dig> phase and underwent apoptosis started to increase at same timing . thus, the present results suggest that tax may induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by activating several genes related to stress-response signaling pathways. this is supported by a recent publication showing that tax, along with the activation of a stress kinase, can induce cell death  <cit> . furthermore, the present findings consist with those observed by previous microarray analysis studies of htlv-1-infected t cells, which demonstrated that htlv- <dig> infection upregulated jnk activation kinase  <dig>  gadd <dig> and the inflammatory cytokine, il1β, which are involved in mapk stress-response pathways  <cit> . recently, htlv- <dig> tax appeared indirectly to connect to cell cycle proteins such as smad <dig>  smad <dig>  gadd45a and gadd45b  <cit> .

our microarray analysis results identified one of the genes upregulated by tax as cdkn1a, which codes p21cip1/waf <dig>  known as cdk inhibitor  <dig>  again, this is in agreement with results from other microarray analyses showing that htlv- <dig> infection and tax expression upregulated p21cip1/waf <dig> in htlv-1-infected t cells  <cit>  and the human jurkat t-cell line jpx- <dig>  which express tax under the control of an inducible promoter  <cit> . likewise, tax has previously been shown to dramatically upregulate p21cip1/waf <dig> mrna transcription and stabilization of p21cip1/waf <dig> in hela cells  <cit> . interestingly, only minimal p21/waf <dig> promoter activity appears to be induced by tax  <cit> . it is also known that basal levels of p21cip1/waf <dig> are required to promote tgfβ-mediated cell cycle arrest, whereas a lack of p21cip1/waf <dig> allows the induction of cell proliferation in response to tgfβ  <cit> . indeed, the loss of p21cip1/waf <dig> and p27kip <dig> from hos cells apparently allows htlv-1-and tax-induced g <dig> arrest to be bypassed  <cit> . therefore, tax may induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in hela cells by up-regulating gadd45b, smad <dig> and smad <dig>  in the presence of p21cip1/waf <dig> .

in htlv- <dig> infected t cell lines, upregulated p21cip1/waf <dig> may potentially function as an assembly factor for the cyclin d2/cdk <dig> complex, and the p21/cyclin d2/cdk <dig> complex may not act as an inhibitory complex but instead may allow the increased phosphorylation of rb and accelerated progression into s phase  <cit> . in the present study, tax-mediated g <dig> arrest occurred in human papilloma virus type  <dig> -transformed hela cells, in which the rb pathway was activated by repression of hpv- <dig> e <dig>  <cit> . indeed, in cells transfected with the control vector, the majority of rb was in the hyperphosphorylated form pprb . by contrast, an accumulation of hypo- and/or unphosphorylated form prb was observed in tax-expressing hela cells, which is in contrast to the results of study showing that tax increased the phosphorylation of rb family members  <cit> . therefore, there is a strong possibility that tax-activated p21cip1/waf <dig> may function to inhibit the cyclin d2/cdk <dig> complex, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest.

our microarray result also shows that tax upregulated the expression of bcl <dig> gene encodes a sequences-specific transcriptional repressor by  <dig>  fold. this supported by the findings in previous study  <cit> , which described that an interaction of tax with the poz domain of bcl <dig> enhances the repressive activity of bcl <dig> and increased the levels of apoptosis induced by bcl <dig> in osteosarcoma cells. the bcl <dig> poz domain mediates transcriptional repression by interacting with several corepressors including silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptor and nuclear hormone receptor corepressor, bcl <dig> corepressor together with many histone deacetylases. bcl <dig> colocalizes with these corepressors in punctate nuclear structures that have been identified as sites of ongoing dna replication. interestingly, bcl <dig> appeared to recruite tax into punctate nuclear structures and significantly downregulate both basal and tax-induced nf-kb and long terminal repeat activation  <cit> . thus, the high expression of bcl <dig> in htlv infected cells may contribute to the silencing of viral gene expression and to the long clinical latency associated with htlv infection.

this study allows greater understanding of the biological events affected by htlv- <dig> tax, particularly the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. since we found evidence of several similarities, as well as differences, between tax-expressing hela cells and htlv infection in t cell lines, we believe that the overexpression of tax will be useful for preliminary studies on the effects of htlv infection in t cell lines. however, since zane et al. recently demonstrated that infected cd4+ t cells in vivo are positively selected for cell cycling but not cell death  <cit> , our experimental approaches in hela cells may not be reflective of normal physiology of tax or htlv- <dig> in vivo infected cells. therefore, further detailed studies are required to define the direct and indirect effects of tax-mediated cellular processes to gain a better understanding of the contribution of tax to htlv- <dig> pathogenesis in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study showed that tax arrested cells at the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle, thereby inducing apoptosis. taken together, the results demonstrate that tax exerts a significant impact on cellular factors that regulate the cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis. importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight the morphological dynamics of tax-induced cell death after cell cycle arrest at the g <dig> phase.

this overview can be extended to tax-mediated signaling, and further study of the interactions between tax and cellular factors will provide insights into the mechanisms by which tax regulates host cell behavior, as well as the mechanisms underlying lymphoma induction and progression induced by htlv- <dig>
