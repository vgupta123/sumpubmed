BACKGROUND
gene duplication has long been considered as one of the main mechanisms of the adaptive evolution and as an important source of the genetic novelty  <cit> . differential duplications and deletions of chromosomal regions including coding genes provide a powerful source for the evolution of species-specific biological differences  <cit> . compared to other mammals, the genomes of primates show an enrichment of large segmental duplications with high levels  of sequence identity  <cit> . in the human genome particularly pronounced expansions of the copy number have been reported for genes involved in the structure and function of the brain  <cit> . in comparison of human and its closest relative chimpanzee, large duplications contribute considerably  to the overall divergence compared to single base pair substitutions . in addition to providing the substrate for non-allelic homologous recombination mediating genomic disorders , the duplication architecture of a genome may also influence normal phenotypic variation. it has been estimated that ~20% of segmental duplications are polymorphic within human and chimpanzee populations contributing to intraspecies diversity  <cit> . despite the fact that segmental duplications cover a substantial fraction of the great apes genomes, the experimental data on the divergence and detailed evolutionary dynamics of duplicated gene regions is still limited. sequence comparison of duplicated genes in sister-species would assist in understanding the mechanisms behind primate evolution and in associating the genetic divergence with phenotypic diversification.

one of the genomic regions that has evolved through several gene duplication events in primate lineage is the luteinizing hormone beta /chorionic gonadotropin beta  gene cluster locating in human at 19q <dig> . the lhb/cgb genes have an essential role in reproduction: placentally expressed hcg hormone contributes to the implantation process of the embryo during the early stages of pregnancy, pituitary expressed luteinizing hormone promotes the ovulation and luteinization of follicles and stimulates the steroidogenesis. in human, the cluster consists of seven highly homologous genes: an ancestral lhb and six duplicated cgb genes  <cit> . the data from other primates supports the hypothesis of several sequential duplication events increasing gradually the number of cgb genes among primates from one  to six in human . the mapped copy number of the cgb gene among old world monkeys varies: three in rhesus macaque , five in guereza monkey  and dusky leaf monkey , four in orangutan   <cit> . it has been suggested that cgb gene first arose in the common ancestor of the anthropoid primates after diverging from tarsiers  <cit> .

we have chosen lhb/cgb genomic region as a model to study the evolution of recent primate duplications. although the chimpanzee genome has been sequenced, there are still large gaps and uncertainties concerning the segmental duplications regions, including the lhb/cgb region. to obtain a high-quality dna sequence, we constructed and sequenced a shot-gun library, and hereby report the complete sequence of the entire lhb/cgb cluster in the common chimpanzee. we are addressing the following aspects regarding to the evolution of duplicated genes in closely related species:  in-depth comparison of the human and chimpanzee lhb/cgb genome clusters;  variation in substitution rates;  genic and intergenic divergences;  impact of intraspecies gene conversion in phylogeny, divergence and transversion/transition ratios;  evidence of natural selection. to our knowledge, this is the first detailed report of parallel independent duplication events initiated within a duplicated genome cluster and leading to structural divergence in the two sister-species, human and common chimpanzee.

RESULTS
human and chimpanzee lhb/cgb genome clusters differ considerably in size
the total length of the sequenced chimpanzee  lhb/cgb genomic region obtained from two overlapping bac clones was  <dig>  bp. it encompasses  <dig>  bp of the flanking  ruvbl <dig> gene,  <dig>  bp of the entire lhb/cgb cluster and  <dig>  bp of the flanking  ntf <dig> gene . compared to the human  lhb/cgb region , the sequence of the chlhb/cgb cluster is  <dig>  bp shorter. the sequence characteristics of the lhb/cgb genomic regions are similar in these two species: extremely high gc-nucleotide content , high fraction of cpg islands  and repetitive sequences , especially sines  . high repeat content is also characteristic to several other duplicated regions, such as mhc class i region  <cit>  and apolipoprotein ci genomic segment  <cit> .

as expected, there is a considerable similarity between the genomic organization of human and chimpanzee lhb/cgb clusters . we identified two highly identical, apparently orthologous segments within the cluster: ruvbl2/lhb/intergenic region a  and the region spanning from cgb <dig> to ntf <dig> . however, a large species-specific structural rearrangement was localized between the intergenic region a and cgb <dig> gene, resulting in discordant size of human  and chimpanzee  clusters as well as species-specific number of duplicated gene copies, seven for human  and six  for chimpanzee. in human the rearranged region  harbors one hcg beta coding cgb gene and one cgb1/2-like gene  recognized by a specific promoter-segment  <cit> , while in chimp  only a cgb1/2-like gene  is present in an inverted orientation compared to human. in addition, chlhb/cgb cluster lacks the whole intergenic region c' and has a considerably shorter inverted intergenic region b' .

evidence for independent duplication events within lhb/cgb gene cluster for two closely related primate species
we considered alternative scenarios that may have led to structural differences in lhb/cgb clusters in two sister-species. the scenario of species-specific parallel duplications was supported by several lines of evidence . first, it was the most parsimonious solution requiring the smallest number of rearrangement events. assuming that the ancestral hu-chlhb/cgb cluster consisted of the present-day highly identical segments , only one evolutionary event would explain the current structure of chlhb/cgb cluster – a direct duplication of cgb <dig> and most of intergenic region b  giving arise to the segment cgb1b/ch-b'. in humans, two events would have lead to present hulhb/cgb  – an inverted duplication of the entire region from cgb <dig> to cgb <dig> gene  and a direct duplication and translocation of region c creating c' next to cgb <dig> gene . these parallel duplications in two sister-species might have been initiated by non-allelic homologous recombinations between multiple alu sine sequences  locating at the junctions of both human- and chimp-specific duplications. consistently, the phylogenetic trees that were constructed using different fragments of intergenic regions show that ch-b and ch-b', hu-b and hu-b' as well as hu-c and hu-c' clearly cluster together supporting their paralogous status . the hu-d and ch-d region form a well-supported clade  giving evidence that these are orthologous segments. the phylogenetic relationship supports the ancestral status of region c  compared to hu-c' . also the sequence similarity calculations are consistent with the scenario of independent species-specific duplications: the identity of ch-b and ch-b' regions is  <dig> %, and of chcgb <dig> and chcgb1b  <dig> %. the latter exceeds the estimates for any orthologous genes between human and chimp in lhb/cgb cluster . however, the possibility of more intensive gene conversion between these intergenic segments resulting in higher intraspecies similarity cannot be excluded. it is well known that past intraspecies gene conversion events might be reflected by tree phylogenies and could lead to erroneous conclusions  <cit> . the footprint of gene conversion is also reflected on the phylogenic tree of human and chimpanzee lhb/cgb genes . instead of two separate clades for orthologous cgb <dig> and cgb <dig>  the genes within one species cluster together.

alternative scenarios leading to discordant gene number in lhb/cgb gene clusters in these two species are less supported. a minimum of three rearrangement events  would have been required for the chimpanzee-specific deletion: loss of cgb and psntf6a gene accompanied with the inversion of cgb <dig> and intergenic region b' , and a separate deletion of region c' in chimp. also the scenario of human-specific duplication  would have required at least three events: an inversion of cgb1b and intergenic region ch-b' ; either a direct duplication and translocation of cgb <dig> gene along with psntf6a' or an inverted duplication and translocation of cgb <dig> along with psntf6g' , and a direct duplication and translocation of intergenic region c creating hu-c' next to cgb <dig> gene.

a number of gene families have been characterized where the gene number differs between human and chimpanzee due to species-specific indels  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first report where parallel independent duplications arisen within the same region in human and chimpanzee genomes give the best explanation for the observed structural differences between two sister-species. however, there are examples of independent duplications among primates resulting in convergent functions. a more recent duplication of x-linked opsin gene in new world howler monkeys  compared to old world primates, has lead to full trichromacy  <cit>  and also there are independently arisen functionally close genes within the growth hormone/somatomammotropin genome cluster in new world monkeys and old world monkeys/hominoid lineages  <cit> .

comparative nucleotide divergence profiling of the orthologous regions reveals non-uniform substitution rates across the lhb/cgb region
we generated a comparative nucleotide divergence profile of substitutions and indels across the orthologous genomic regions of lhb/cgb cluster . human  and chimpanzee  aligned genomic sequences were analyzed using a non-overlapping sliding window of  <dig> bp. several studies have suggested that the majority of the genomic divergence between human and chimpanzee comprises of indels  compared to contribution of nucleotide substitutions   <cit> . in the duplicated lhb/cgb region indels  and substitutions  contributed approximately equally to the total divergence  between the two species. in total,  <dig> indels  were identified,  <dig> as human and  <dig> as chimpanzee deletions. the size distribution of these indels was consistent with previous reports  <cit>  revealing an excess of short indels: 44% involved a single basepair, 77% 1– <dig> bp and  <dig> % < <dig> bp . two large indels of > <dig> bp co-locate with repetitive elements: the  <dig> bp long indel in intergenic region a is located in a simple-repeat rich region; the  <dig> bp indel in intergenic region b is flanked and composed of sine sequences . the latter indel could be defined as a recent human-specific sequence loss since the duplicated human-specific intergenic region b' lacks this deletion. high proportion  of indels identified between human and chimpanzee has been shown to contain repetitive elements  <cit> . the regional content of repeats was also correlated with the non-uniform distribution of the nucleotide identity across the cluster  consistent with the data that repetitive sequences, e.g. alu repeats have a higher rate of base substitutions  <cit> .

transition to transversion ratio in duplicated regions differs from the estimations for unique genomic sequences: possible role of gene conversion
we investigated the distribution of nucleotide substitutions within orthologous regions of lhb/cgb cluster in more detail . transitions  and transversions  were found to contribute 62% and 38% of the total substitutions in five orthologous lhb/cgb genes, respectively . the corresponding estimates for the whole orthologous region  were 57% for transitions and 43% for transversions . notably, the contribution of transitions is ~10% lower than reported in previous studies comparing human and chimpanzee genomic regions   <cit> . the most frequent transversions are g⇔c substitutions, contributing 16% of all substitutions in genes and 18% across entire orthologous region, exceeding previous estimations by twofold   <cit> . consistently, a large excess of g⇔c transversional pairs as compared to other substitutions has been reported for human hsp <dig> and mouse hsp <dig> orthologous duplicate genes  <cit> . the high proportion of transversions in the lhb/cgb cluster can be explained by biased gene conversion  <cit>  that leads to a high gc content  and thus increases the probability of g⇔c substitutions due to the altered base composition  <cit> .

among the transitions, we observed an excess of c⇔t substitutions in lhb/cgb genes  versus the whole region . it is generally accepted that a high proportion of transitions are c to t substitutions in cpg dinucleotides, exhibiting about  <dig> times higher mutation rate than the genomic average  <cit> . a higher gc content  and presence of cpg islands could explain an excess of c⇔t substitutions in lhb/cgb genes compared to intergenic regions.

sequence divergence between human and chimpanzee duplicated lhb/cgb genes is higher than estimates for single copy genes
we studied the human and the chimpanzee orthologous genes lhb, cgb <dig>  cgb <dig>  cgb <dig> and cgb <dig> for nucleotide divergence. the nucleotide divergence ranged from  <dig> % for lhb to  <dig> % for cgb <dig> and cgb <dig> genomic sequences . despite that the coding regions are most conserved among the species, the exonic divergence rates  exceeded many times the previous estimates for single-copy regions  <cit> . in non-coding regions, the average nucleotide divergence for promoter regions was as high as  <dig> % , for introns  <dig> %  and for 5' utr  <dig> % . the comparative estimates for single-copy genes are much lower: in promoters  <dig> – <dig> %, in exons  <dig> – <dig> %, in introns  <dig> – <dig> % and in 5' utr  <dig> – <dig> %  <cit> . it has been suggested that interaction of selection and gene conversion contributes to a higher divergence and diversity in multigene families compared to single-copy genes  <cit> . as any de novo mutation has a potential to be spread by gene conversion from the original locus to other gene copies, every duplicate could accumulate substitutions arisen in neighboring genes.

notably, when the polymorphism data from re-sequencing studies of the human   <cit>  and the chimpanzee   lhb/cgb genes were incorporated into calculations, the sequence divergence in genes dropped from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in lhb, from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in cgb <dig>  from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in cgb <dig> and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in cgb <dig> . still, a higher divergence compared to the published data for single-copy genes remained.

most importantly, our data indicates that the divergence estimates between human and chimpanzee might be substantially lower than reported when the intraspecies variation is taken into account.

duplicated, highly homologous lhb/cgb genes evolve under different selective constraints
a number of non-synonymous changes were identified in human-chimpanzee comparison: two in lhb, two in cgb <dig>  three in cgb <dig> and cgb <dig> and four in cgb <dig> . none of the differences found in exonic regions in chimp altered the orf nor created a preliminary stop-codon compared to human genes. the maximum likelihood  method was used to estimate ω, non-synonymous /synonymous  rate ratio for the orthologous genes  in the human and chimpanzee lhb/cgb gene cluster   <cit> . for four of the compared genes  the parameter was ω <  <dig>  indicating purifying selection. an especially low ω estimate was obtained for lhb  and cgb <dig> . consistently, the dn/dsratio calculated by an alternative li <dig> method  <cit>  was statistically significant  for lhb and reached borderline significance for the cgb <dig>  . indeed, the lhb gene is highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution in association with its function – it is coding for the receptor-binding beta subunit of luteinizing hormone  critical for successful reproduction  <cit> . the functional constraint of the human cgb <dig> may be associated with its major role in contributing to the hcg beta subunit mrna transcript pool compared to other cgb genes  <cit> .

cgb <dig> gene  stood out as the only locus in the gene cluster with estimated ω > <dig>  which would be consistent with positive or adaptive evolution. it has been suggested that cgb <dig> has arisen in the common ancestor of african great apes through a duplication event accompanied by an insertion of a novel putative promoter, 5'utr and exon  <dig>  so far, the detection of cgb <dig> gene has been unsuccessful in orangutan pongo pygmaeus by using the pcr approach  <cit>  and in macaque macaca mulatta  by in silico search of the current genome assembly. it has been shown that in human the contributions of cgb <dig> and its duplicate human-specific cgb <dig> to the summarized expression of the six cgb genes in placenta is much lower  compared to their gene dosage   <cit> . however, in testis the proportional contribution of cgb1/ <dig> to the total cgb transcript pool is as high as 1/ <dig>  <cit> , which may indicate a possible role of these genes in male reproductive tract. indeed, a recent study has shown that hcg alpha and hcg beta free subunits are produced in high amounts in the prostate and testes and are subsequently observed in seminal plasma  <cit> .

in order to address which parts of the studied genes exhibit signals of evolving under positive selection, we used crann analysis calculating dn and ds values for sliding and overlapping windows along individual genes   <cit> . in case of hcg beta subunit coding genes , the patterns of nucleotide differences between the sister species were similar – across the protein the synonymous substitutions exceeded the non-synonymous ones and were concentrated in the n- and c-terminus of the protein. in contrast, in cgb <dig> the non-synonymous substitutions dominated and were distributed in the signal peptide  and the centre of the protein.

impact of gene duplications in primate divergence
primate-specific gene duplications have involved loci regulating immunity , reproduction , development and adaptation , and brain functions   <cit> . it has been suggested that these duplication events may have been facilitated by non-allelic homologous recombination between alu sequences, expanded into millions of copies all over primate genomes  <cit> . there are several examples of independent duplication events in the new world monkey  and old world monkey /hominoid lineages as well as in distinct primate species. for example, the owm and apes have three opsin genes and are trichromats due to gene duplication at the base of the owm lineage. in nwm, the situation is more variable: most species exhibit two opsin genes, but in the howler monkey an additional gene duplication has led to full trichromacy  <cit> . in growth hormone gene cluster  some of the duplicate genes in the owm/hominoid lineages have acquired a novel function and code for chorionic somatomammotropin  involved in the glucose metabolism of the fetus and the mother. however, the csh genes are missing from the genomes of nw monkeys  <cit> . further species-specific duplications of gh/csh genes have been reported for gibbon, macaque, chimpanzee and human  <cit> . in human-chimpanzee comparison, only three gh/csh genes are clearly orthologous  <cit> . other gene clusters with independent gene duplications in human, apes and macaque lineages are mhc and testes-expressed prame genes  <cit> . the ancestral mhc-b duplicated into mhc-b and mhc-c in hominoids. while human mhc-c orthologs are found in african apes and orangutans, they are not present in macaque or any other ow monkeys  <cit> . species-specific evolutionary scenarios have also been reported for lhb/cgb genes  <cit> . in addition to the structural differences between human and chimpanzee lhb/cgb genes reported in this study, an expansion of cgb genes up to  <dig> gene copies has been shown in gorilla   <cit> . despite the high number of structural differences that has been shown between human and chimpanzee genomes by in silico whole-genome analysis , the experimental data for copy number differences between these sister-species has been reported only for a few gene clusters   <cit> .

in addition to creating structural divergence among the species, duplications provide also the bases for diversification of gene functions. for primate-specific gene duplications, there is evidence of variability in evolutionary rates among the gene copies within and among the species, and of different selective constraints acting on different members of the gene clusters, such as mhc, beta-globin, gh/csh, prame, rh blood group, cd33rsiglec and beta-defensin genes  <cit> . for example, in human-chimpanzee comparison, the chimp mhc class i loci a, b and c are characterized by lower intra-species allelic variation compared to human, providing evidence that ancestral chimpanzee populations may have experienced a selective sweep  <cit> . in marmoset lhb/cgb region, a switch of functions has happened between the ancestral lhb and the derived cgb gene. although lhb and cgb genes are both present at the genomic level, only cgb gene is expressed in the pituitary and placenta tissues. thus, chorionic gonadotropin hormone is the only gonadotropin carrying also the luteinizing function fulfilled by luteinizing hormone in mammals  <cit> .

duplicated genes tend to evolve in consort facilitated by active inter-locus gene conversion increasing and preserving sequence similarity among the gene copies  <cit> . concerted evolution within species may lead to erroneous phylogenetic trees and to the overestimation of interspecies divergence dates  <cit> . incorporation of gene conversion data into the equations for calculating interspecies divergence may be still a challenge requiring detailed knowledge of a particular genomic region.

so far, only a limited number of reports has been published that focus on detailed variation patterns of duplicated gene families in primates   <cit> . however, the common observation is that compared to single-copy segments, duplicated regions tend to exhibit higher interspecies diversity that could be explained by relaxed selective pressures and/or gene conversions spreading mutations. thus, when calculating the divergence in duplicated primate-specific regions, the inclusion or exclusion of intraspecies variation data into equations may have a substantial impact on the divergence estimates.

CONCLUSIONS
we compared the human and chimpanzee duplicated lhb/cgb genome clusters and hereby present the detailed evidence for parallel independent duplication events in the two sister-species resulting in discordant number of cgb genes . to our knowledge, this is the first detailed report of parallel duplications in these sister-species leading to structural divergence. the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes is shaped by the interaction of gene conversion and selection. in lhb/cgb gene cluster, active gene conversion may have contributed to higher interspecies sequence divergence  and altered transition/transversion ratio compared to the single-copy loci. this higher divergence remained when intraspecies variation was taken into account. however, the drop in divergence estimates after incorporating the intraspecies variation data promotes to reanalyze previously studied loci, where the human-chimpanzee divergence may be substantially lower than initially calculated. despite the high sequence homology among lhb/cgb genes , there are signs of functional differentiation among the gene copies. to reconstruct the full evolutionary history of lhb/cgb gene cluster, further studies are required comprising high-quality sequence data from several primate species.
