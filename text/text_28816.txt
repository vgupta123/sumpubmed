BACKGROUND
serum response factor  is a nuclear transcription factor of the mads  box family. srf interacts as a dimer with dna at the serum response element , a  <dig> base pair at-rich sequence  also known as the carg box . the sre sequence is present in a wide variety of genes, including those encoding for immediate early proteins , neuronal nuclear receptors  and numerous contractile and cytoskeletal proteins . expression of srf is essential in early development as srf-null embryos die during gastrulation  <cit> . srf is required for development of mesoderm  <cit> . the expression pattern of genes under srf control is regulated in a combinatorial fashion by srf's ability to interact with a variety of accessory factors such as elk- <dig> and sap- <dig> to regulate expression of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation, and myocardin and related family factors to control myogenic gene expression .

srf plays a critical role in myogenesis. early studies established the expression of srf in cells of the myogenic lineage  <cit> , and srf has been shown to be required for appropriate skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . srf gene knockout studies from our laboratory indicate that disruption of srf in cardiomyocytes leads to severe defects in the contractile apparatus, including z-disc and stress fiber formation, as well as mislocalization and/or attenuation of sarcomeric protein expression  <cit> . consistent with these observations, in vivo cardiovascular-specific knockout of srf results in embryonic death via cardiovascular failure due to perturbations in normal muscle cytoarchitecture and contractile assembly  <cit> . numerous studies suggest that disordered myogenic gene expression is due to defective srf-mediated regulation of the smooth muscle cell-specific regulatory factor myocardin  <cit> .

srf is a key regulator in development of the coronary vasculature. coronary vasculature is derived from a transient embryonic structure termed the proepicardium   <cit> . the pe is characterized as a small, grape cluster-like aggregate of cells developing at embryonic day  <dig>  from an extension of the septum transversum, lying beneath the developing heart tube  <cit> . cells of the pe undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  and migrate over the surface of the heart. some cells form the primitive epicardium, and others appear to continue to infiltrate into the subepicardial space. once dispersed into the heart tissue, these subepicardial mesenchymal cells  differentiate into the vascular smooth muscle cells  and vascular endothelial cells  that comprise the coronary vasculature  <cit> . previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated expression of srf within cells of the pe and newly formed coronary vessels  <cit> . landerholm and colleagues  <cit>  have shown that inhibitory srf constructs block differentiation of avian pe to vsmc, indicating a central role for srf in differentiation of pe-derived cells to vsmc.

a role for srf in differentiation and function of vsmc is well established, however, little is known about the role of srf in vec  <cit> . using primary huvec cultures, chai and colleagues  <cit>  have shown that vascular endothelial growth factor  signalling pathways require srf. endothelial cells in which srf has been knocked down fail to respond to intercellular vegf signalling and show abolished vegf-induced in vitro angiogenesis, impaired endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and inhibited vegf-induced actin polymerization and immediate early gene expression.

these studies indicate that srf likely plays an important role in endothelial cell function. the in vivo role of endothelial srf, however, has not been addressed. therefore, in the current study we investigated the role of srf in vec function by carrying out endothelial cell-specific ablation of the srf gene. mice homozygous for srf-lox p  alleles were bred to mice expressing the cre recombinase protein under tie <dig> promoter control . tie <dig> is a vascular endothelial-specific tyrosine kinase receptor for the angiopoietin family of vascular remodelling factors  <cit> . the onset of tie2cre expression is concurrent with the appearance of endothelium in e <dig>  embryos and continues in adult tissues  <cit> . in embryos expressing the mutant genotype tie2cre+/-srff/f, we observed hemorrhaging by e <dig>  and near complete lethality by e <dig> . examination of cardiac morphology revealed smaller hearts as well as mild ventricular-septal defects in mutant embryos as compared to wild-type littermates. immunohistochemical analysis suggests vec properly differentiated and assembled blood vessels. however, the appearance of blood pools and segmented blood vessels observed in embryos and yolk sacs of e <dig> –e <dig>  embryos indicated disrupted vascular networks consistent with a defect in vascular remodelling. further analysis of yolk sac tissues by electron microscopy demonstrated a lack of desmosomal-type junction complexes as well as a paucity of collagen matrix between the endodermal and mesodermal cell layers. e-cadherin protein detected by immunofluorescence showed a dramatic decrease in signal along the apical brush-border of endothelial cells in the extraembryonic endodermal layer in yolk sac. these results provide the first in vivo evidence in support of a role for srf in endothelial cell function and strongly suggest srf is required for appropriate vascular remodelling.

RESULTS
conditional ablation of srf protein in endothelium causes hemorrhaging in developing embryos
inspection of embryos harvested from tie2cre+/-srff/+ × srff/f matings revealed internal hemorrhaging and blood pooling consistent with loss of vascular organization . mutant embryos appeared to develop normally until e <dig>  . however, by e <dig>  embryos expressing the mutant genotype tie2cre+/-srff/f began to exhibit internal hemorrhaging . the extent of bleeding continued to progress with embryonic age . wild-type littermates showed intact vascular formation in contrast to mutant embryos . upon closer examination, loss of vascular formation in the mutant embryos becomes more obvious . a striking difference in the lack of apparent intact vasculature was observed in tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos compared to wild-type littermates . blood pooling noted in mutant embryos  supports a loss of vascular integrity.

endothelial-specific disruption of the srf gene during development causes embryonic lethality
the effect of endothelial-specific conditional ablation of srf protein expression during embryonic development was evaluated. loss of srf expression in endothelial cells was achieved by tie <dig> driven-cre recombinase-mediated excision of the promoter region and first exon of srf  <cit> . the conditional loss of srf gene function in endothelial cells resulted in embryonic death by e <dig>  . the majority of animals expressing the mutant genotype tie2cre+/-srff/f displayed an abnormal phenotype, and all necrotic embryos collected expressed the mutant genotype. no animals with a mutant genotype were detected in late gestation or at birth.

genotypic analysis of mouse embryos generated by crossing tie2cre+/-srff/+ male mice with srff/f female mice. numbers represent total embryos of each genotype; numbers in parentheses indicate mutant phenotype and grossly necrotic embryos. the conditional loss of srf gene function in endothelial cells resulted in embryonic death by e <dig> ; no animals with mutant genotype were detected during late gestational age or at birth.

hearts of tie2cre+/-srff/f mutant embryos are smaller
since srf plays a central role in cardiac development, we examined cardiac morphology of mutant embryos and their wild-type littermates to ascertain whether observed embryonic lethality was due to abnormal cardiac morphogenesis. embryos harvested from timed-pregnant female mice were subjected to fixation for analysis of morphology or for quantification of whole body and isolated heart weights. hearts of wild-type embryos correctly formed atrial and ventricular chambers, and major vessels of the atrial tree were present . in contrast, the muscular portion of the interventricular septum in hearts of tie2cre+/-srff/f mutant genotype embryos appeared reduced , potentially resulting in ventricular-septal defects. furthermore, enlarged vessels were observed in mutant embryos, presumably due to edema caused by vascular insufficiency . analysis of endocardial cushion extracellular matrix deposition revealed no difference between wild-type and mutant littermates .

hearts of mutant embryos appeared smaller than those of wild-type littermates. to assess this observation, whole body and isolated heart weights from e <dig>  and e <dig>  embryos were used to calculate heart weights as a percentage of overall body weight . the decrease in apparent size of mutant hearts appeared as early as e <dig>  ; however, differences in whole body and heart weights at this age did not reach statistical significance . normalized heart weights from e <dig>  mutant embryos were reduced . furthermore, immunofluorescent analysis of phosphorylated histone h <dig> in e <dig>  embryos revealed an apparent reduction in the number of endocardial endothelial cells undergoing proliferation ; no difference in apoptotic activity was detected . in contrast, the ratio of cardiomyocytes to total cells was not different between wild-type and mutant heart tissues , suggesting that the heart size differences noted are not due to a selective loss of cardiomyocytes. e <dig>  embryos with mutant genotype were grossly necrotic and unsuitable for analysis.

yolk sac vasculature fails in tie2cre+/-srff/f mutant embryos
the tie2cre construct is expressed in blood islands and hemangioblasts within the extraembryonic yolk sac as early as e <dig>   <cit> . ablation of srf protein expression in yolk sac endothelial tissues caused blood vessel disorganization and subsequent vascular failure . yolk sac blood vessels appeared normal in both wild-type and mutant animals until e <dig>  . in contrast, the yolk sacs of e <dig>  and e <dig>  mutant embryos contained blood pools and fragmented blood vessels , consistent with impaired vascular remodelling. closer examination revealed a web of poorly organized vessels .

srf protein is localized within endothelial cells
to establish the expression of srf within vec of the coronary vasculature, we performed double-label immunofluorescent analysis of embryonic mouse heart. ventricular tissue was isolated from wild-type e <dig>  mouse embryos, after coronary vessels have formed; corresponding tie2cre+/-srff/f samples were not obtainable as affected embryos die by e <dig> . sections of paraffin-embedded ventricular tissue were immunolabelled for both pecam- <dig> and srf proteins and examined by confocal laser microscopy . pecam-1-stained endothelial cells were clearly visible surrounding vessels in ventricular myocardium as well as surrounding the myocardial wall . cardiomyocytes showed robust srf staining . higher magnification imaging of a single focal plane showed nuclear-localized srf immunostaining  surrounded by pecam- <dig> labelled endothelial cell membranes .

srf protein is decreased in vec from tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos
we analyzed embryonic vascular tissues using double-label immunofluorescence microscopy to verify the loss of srf protein in affected cells . tissues from e <dig>  wild-type  and mutant  embryos were labelled with antibodies against srf and the vec-marker pecam- <dig> and analyzed by confocal laser microscopy. single-plane confocal images of blood vessels were used to count the total number of vec and the number of vec exhibiting srf. only those cells showing srf signal completely encircled by pecam- <dig> staining were scored as srf-positive vec . final numbers were expressed as percent srf-positive vec of the total counted for that vessel. a high proportion of vec in wild-type vessels were positive for srf  compared to mutant vessels .

since the tie2cre construct has been shown to be expressed in endocardial endothelial cells, we analyzed embryonic ventricular tissue for the presence or absence of srf protein using single-plane confocal images as described above . we found a higher number of endocardial endothelial cells exhibiting srf-positive immunofluorescence in wild-type as compared to mutant tissues. no significant change in expression of srf protein was observed between wild-type or mutant embryos in the epicardium . furthermore, to verify that srf protein expression in cardiomyocytes was not grossly affected by loss of srf in endothelial cells, we analyzed srf protein expression in embryonic heart tissues by immunodetection; however, no differences were noted .

early coronary vessel formation appears normal in mutant embryos
coronary vessels begin to form at approximately e <dig> , with the coronary vascular network complete by e <dig>   <cit> . we examined early coronary vessel formation by whole-mount immunohistochemical analysis of hearts from e <dig>  embryos . we used the vec-specific cell-surface marker pecam- <dig> to label vascular structures in hearts from both wild-type and tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos. vessels on the external ventral  and dorsal  surfaces are visible and seem intact in both wild-type and tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos. this observation indicates that initial formation of the coronary vasculature is not affected by loss of srf in endothelial cells. however, we were unable to complete assessment of the angiogenic remodelling responsible for maturation of the coronary vascular network in mutant embryos as they die and become grossly necrotic by e <dig> .

yolk sac tissues from tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos retain vec despite fragmentation of blood vessels
the tie2cre construct is expressed in endodermal tissue layers of the yolk sac as well as in vec. yolk sac vascular networks undergo extensive remodelling during the course of embryogenesis. based on our observation of fragmented yolk sac vessels, we sought to determine the status of vec within yolk sac tissues. we looked for the presence of vec within yolk sac tissues by immunolabelling whole mount samples of e <dig>  wild-type and tie2cre+/-srff/f yolk sac tissues with the vec marker pecam- <dig> . yolk sac tissues from embryos lacking srf in endothelium demonstrated the presence of appropriately differentiated vec; however, blood vessels in srf-null yolk sac tissues were almost completely disintegrated by this age. remnants of presumed blood vessels could still be seen , suggesting incomplete vessel remodelling or inappropriate maintenance of existing vessels.

furthermore, cross-sectional examination of tie2cre+/-srff/f yolk sac tissues revealed delamination of the endodermal and mesodermal components of the yolk sac layers . tissues immunolabelled by the vec marker pecam- <dig> showed separation of the endodermal and mesodermal tissues . also, some areas of laminar separation were observed to contain blood cells, suggesting these areas derived from either blood vessels or blood islands. quantitation of the linear length of laminar separation in cross-sections shows that yolk sac tissues from mutant animals have a greater degree of laminar separation than wild-type littermates .

mutant yolk sac tissues lack cell-cell junctions and intra-laminar collagen deposition
samples of yolk sac tissues from wild-type and tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos were processed for analysis by transmission electron microscopy . wild-type tissues contained desmosomal-type junction complexes that were absent in tie2cre+/-srff/f tissues . furthermore, collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix between the endodermal and mesodermal yolk sac layers was greatly diminished . sub-cellular elements of both endodermal and mesodermal cells in mutant tissue appeared largely normal, and did not display signs of necrosis nor apoptotic bodies. this observation suggests that the loss of cell-cell adhesion complexes is not due to gross disintegration of the yolk sac tissue as a whole, but rather is a consequence of srf deprivation.

e-cadherin is decreased in tie2cre+/-srff/f embryonic yolk sac tissues
we sought to confirm our electron microscopy observations by immunofluorescent labelling of junctional complexes by e-cadherin . wild-type and tie2cre+/-srff/f yolk sac tissues were double-labelled with the endothelial cell marker pecam- <dig> and e-cadherin and subjected to fluorescent microscopy for analysis. wild-type endodermal cells displayed intense e-cadherin localization along the apical brush-border surface, a staining pattern largely absent from mutant tissues . closer examination by confocal laser microscopy confirmed the lack of detectable e-cadherin .

discussion
numerous studies have shown that srf is a critical transcriptional regulator of genes important for vsmc differentiation and development, and therefore a key regulator of vascular development. consistent with this, srf is required for differentiation of pe-derived precursors to vsmc during coronary vascular development  <cit> . we have previously shown, however, that srf is expressed in the pe prior to detectable expression of vsmc markers  <cit> , raising the possibility that srf may play a role in differentiation of pe-derived coronary vec as well. to begin to address this idea, we have sought to investigate the role of srf in endothelial cells in vivo, and whether endothelial srf is required for normal vascular development. towards that end, we crossed mice expressing cre recombinase under the vec-specific tie2-derived promoter with mice carrying floxed srf alleles. our data demonstrate that srf plays a crucial role in appropriate vec function beginning early in embryonic development.

mutant embryos lacking srf expression in vec die by e <dig> . examination of heart structure reveals that hearts of tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos undergo looping and chamber formation; however, hearts of mutant embryos are measurably smaller with increasing gestational age compared to wild-type littermates. we did not detect a difference in the percentage of cardiomyocytes in heart tissue between wild-type and mutant embryos despite noting a small decrease in cardiomyocyte proliferation. analysis of apoptotic activity by cleaved caspase  <dig> immunoreactivity also showed no discernible difference between wild-type and mutant embryos. based on the well-documented specificity of the tie2cre driver, it is unlikely that the small decrease in cardiomyocyte proliferation observed is due to direct cre-mediated excision of the srf allele in cardiomyocytes  <cit> . one possible explanation for the reduction in cardiomyocyte proliferation in mutant embryos is that there is a defect in signalling to cardiomyocytes. in support of this idea, a variety of studies have demonstrated the importance of reciprocal signalling pathways between endocardial endothelial cells and the developing myocardium . this raises the possibility that impaired signalling from srf-null endocardial endothelial cells is contributing to reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and the overall decrease in heart size observed in tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos. the apparent reduction in endocardial cell proliferation we observed in mutant embryos further suggests that loss of srf in endothelial cells results in impaired endocardial endothelial cell function; however, which endothelial signalling pathways are impaired in srf-null cells remains to be determined.

endocardial cushion tissues are present; however, septal tissues appear poorly formed in mutant embryos, and in some cases exhibit a failure to form ventricular septa. nevertheless, in utero lethality lacking gross defects in heart structure supports the idea of vascular failure as a cause of death. lethal vessel malfunction may be occurring within the atrial tree, embryonic or extra-embryonic vasculature, or yolk sac vasculature. consistent with this, mutant embryos exhibit hemorrhaging within the head, abdomen, and limbs as early as e <dig> , a time when blood vessel remodelling is occurring. yolk sac vasculature is also disrupted, suggesting a common mechanism of vessel malfunction in both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues.

initial vessel formation in the heart begins at approximately e <dig>  and is completed with establishment of mature coronary arteries by e <dig>   <cit> . early coronary vasculogenesis appears to occur normally in embryos lacking srf in vec as shown by the presence of pecam-1-positive vessels in hearts from both wild-type and mutant e <dig>  embryos. nevertheless, mutant embryos die by e <dig> , leaving the issue of srf's role in coronary vasculature remodelling and maturation unclear. determining the precise requirement for srf in vec specification is also complex since the tie2cre construct begins expression presumably after hemangioblast specification. examination of blood smears from e <dig>  embryos reveals no grossly observable differences between wild-type and mutant samples . this may suggest that early vec progenitors in the yolk sac are not influenced by excision of the srf gene; however since the srf protein has a relatively long half-life  <cit> , we cannot rule out the possibility that residual srf protein levels remain sufficient to sustain specification and differentiation of early vec. these questions are better suited to investigation using in vitro model systems of vec specification and differentiation, and are the object of ongoing studies.

while it is evident that srf protein levels are reduced in vec of mutant embryos, detectable srf protein in both wild-type and tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos suggests a significant degree of mosaicism. also, the stringency of our method for quantitation of srf protein in vec may result in an underestimation of the number of cells displaying detectable srf protein. we have observed varying degrees of srf-floxed allele excision efficiency based on the cre recombinase driver, as well as possible variability from cell to cell. this results in a mosaic expression pattern between individual cells; however, the phenotypic effects of the excision still manifest in the tissue as a whole. nevertheless, it is likely that more complete ablation may result in a more severe phenotype.

yolk sac vascular networks undergo extensive remodelling during the course of embryogenesis. in our study, yolk sac vascular networks appear to form normally, echoing what was observed in initial coronary vessel development. however, yolk sac vascular networks became severely disrupted by e <dig> , indicating a failure of the blood vessels to remodel and mature. disintegration of yolk sac vasculature was accompanied by separation of endodermal and mesodermal cell layers. further analysis revealed a lack of desmosomal junctions and intralaminar collagen as well as dramatic loss of e-cadherin in cells of the endodermal layer. anchoring-type desmosomal junctions are plentiful in tissues subject to persistent mechanical stress, such as yolk sac, skin, and heart. proper junction formation relies on appropriate expression of cytoskeletal and cell surface anchoring proteins such as actins, cadherins, and integrins. recent work in our laboratory has shown that srf-null cardiomyocytes have decreased levels of a number of genes associated with cell adhesion and cytoskeletal function including integrins β <dig> and α <dig>  tight junction protein zo- <dig>  and protocadherins  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , raising the possibility that the same genes may be affected in srf-null endothelial cells, resulting in deficient cell-cell contacts.

previous research has shown cadherins are also required for pericyte-endothelial interactions during angiogenic sprouting  <cit> . furthermore, ve-cadherin, a major component of adherens junctions between endothelial cells, has been shown to promote angiogenesis  <cit> . consistent with these findings, putative srf-binding sites have been identified in the ve-cadherin-2/protocadherin <dig>  <cit> , integrin-β <dig>  integrin-β <dig> binding protein  <dig>  protocadherin <dig> and protocadherin <dig> genes  <cit> . these observations suggest the involvement of srf in regulation of cell-cell contacts; however as of yet, no experimental studies have addressed whether srf is a significant player in these interactions, or whether srf is a regulator of these genes in vec.

our results also raise the possibility that srf may play a role in periendothelial cell/pericyte recruitment and vessel stabilization via involvement in angiopoietin  signalling. pecam staining of yolk sac from ang1-null mice shows a loss of vascular integrity similar to that seen in our study  <cit> . ang <dig>  a member of the angiopoietin family of ligands  <cit> , activates the tie <dig> receptor by binding to it and inducing its tyrosine phosphorylation. ang <dig> is generated by non-endothelial cells, such as vsmc and other vascular pericytes recruited to vessels. early in development between e <dig> to e <dig>  ang <dig> is found most prominently in the heart myocardium surrounding the endocardium. later, it becomes more widely distributed, most often detected in the mesenchyme surrounding developing vessels and in close association with endothelial cells. ang1-dependent vessel stabilization occurs by supporting reciprocal interactions between the vascular endothelium, pericytes, and surrounding extracellular matrix and mesenchyme  <cit> . tie <dig> mediates ang <dig> signalling via several known signalling pathways, including the akt, rhoa/rac <dig>  mapk, and erk1/ <dig> pathways  <cit> . since srf is a known mediator of all these pathways  <cit> , this suggests that a role for srf in tie- <dig> mediated angiogenic remodelling may also lie as a downstream effector in the ang1/ <dig> signalling cascade in endothelial cells.

the results presented here unequivocally establish srf as a critical regulator of endothelial cell function in vivo and indicate that appropriate srf protein expression is required for remodelling of vascular networks. however, these results do not directly address the role of srf in endothelial specification and differentiation since the tie2cre construct is expressed in differentiated endothelial cells. our results suggest that disruption of anchoring-type proteins may play a significant role in the observed vascular failure, although the precise underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be addressed. development of reagents that allow functional analyses of srf loss of in endothelial precursors as well as vessel maturation will be required to more fully address these questions.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides the first in vivo experimental evidence of a role for srf in vec function during embryonic development. mouse embryos lacking srf expression in endothelial cells die mid-gestation due to apparent vascular insufficiency. initial analysis suggests a lethal malfunction in angiogenic remodelling and vessel maintenance. the extent to which this malfunction is due to failed reciprocal signalling between vec and surrounding mesenchyme or perhaps incomplete vascular pericyte recruitment remains to be determined.
