BACKGROUND
interferon gamma , produced by activated t and nk cells  <cit> , macrophages and dendritic cells  <cit> , has important immunomodulatory and inflammatory actions  <cit> . the activities of ifn-γ are initiated following association of the cytokine with a membrane-bound receptor  present on many cell types  <cit> . the receptor comprises two subunits . ifngr <dig> has an extracellular portion of  <dig> residues  <cit> , that also occurs in soluble form and can function as an endogenous ifn-γ inhibitor  <cit> . several pathological effects have been ascribed to ifn-γ in animal models and in humans. ifn-γ neutralization inhibits the lethal effect of endotoxin in an animal model of septic shock  <cit> , as well as the rejection of tumor, skin, and heart allografts  <cit> . ifn-γ-mediates pancreatic beta-cell death and the subsequent development of immune-mediated diabetes  <cit>  and accelerates the development of lupus-like disease and nephritis in nzw × nzb- after treatment of f <dig> mice, whereas antibodies to ifn-γ can block or delay the progression of the disease  <cit> . additionally, administration of ifn-γ can promote the development of reactive gliosis in the central nervous system  of adult mice  <cit>  and aggravate the course of multiple sclerosis in humans  <cit> . these observations suggest that ifn-γ antagonist may have therapeutic application in autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammation, and allograft rejection. recently, an anti-ifnγ antibody  has been demonstrated to be of a clinical benefit in patients suffering from crohn's disease  <cit> .

interleukin  <dig>  is a lymphokine synthesized and secreted primarily by t-helper lymphocytes that have been activated by stimulation with certain mitogens or by interaction of the t-cell receptor complex with an antigen/mhc complex on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells  <cit> . the biological activities of il- <dig> are mediated through its binding to a multisubunit cellular receptor. although three distinct transmembrane glycoprotein subunits contribute to the formation of the "definitive" high affinity il- <dig> receptor, various combinations of receptor subunits are known to occur  <cit> . resting cells do not express high-affinity il-2r, but activation with antigen rapidly  <cit>  induces expression.

the main non-redundant activity of il- <dig> consists in the regulation of t-cell tolerance  <cit>  and along with ifn-γ and tnf-β, it is a defining product of the th <dig> subset. production of il- <dig> may contribute to the pathogenesis of some diseases: overproduction of il- <dig> has been seen in patients with multiple sclerosis  <cit> , systemic lupus erythematosus relapses  <cit> , myasthenia gravis  <cit>  and psoriasis  <cit> . however, recent studies indicate that failure of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  regulatory t cells to develop is the underlying cause of autoimmunity in the absence of il- <dig>  <cit> . these observations indicating that both ifn-γ and il- <dig> can promote pathogenesis of inflammation, prompted us to develop a chimeric protein th <dig> antagonist that can simultaneously modulate the biological activities of both cytokines.

RESULTS
construction and expression of th <dig> antagonist
the poly-a mrna for each nucleic acid to be cloned was amplified from jurkat and raji cells expressing il- <dig> and high levels of ifngr <dig>  respectively. cdnas for hu il- <dig> n-terminal fragment  and ifngr <dig> subunit extracellular region  were isolated by rt-pcr amplification of isolated poly-a mrna. the cloning strategy included amplification of each cdna fragment using primers with overlapping nucleotides to permit fusion of the two bands in a later second round-pcr. the fragments were joined in a second pcr using the 5' primer from il- <dig> fragment amplification and the 3' primer for ifngr <dig> extracellular fragment first-round amplification.

these primers contain the sequences suited for nco i and bam hi restriction enzyme cuts, compatible with respective restriction sites in the ptpv- <dig> expression vector, in which the final fused cdna was inserted. the resulting vector contains a bamhi site just before the translational stop codon and the cloned fragment is denoted phu . figure  <dig> summarizes the strategy followed to obtain the expression vector phu .

expression and purification of anth1
w <dig> p <dig> e. coli cells were transformed with phu  plasmid incubated in  <dig> ml growth medium yielded about  <dig> g of e. coli wet biomass, in which th <dig> antagonist protein constituted about  <dig> % of the total protein . a small quantity of th <dig> antagonist was expressed at the start of the induction period, likely related to the fact that ptrip is a strong promoter difficult to be completely silenced. in the same figure, the lanes corresponding to the negative control show a band much fainter with the same migration rate as that of the recombinant molecule. this band was not observed after purification steps and therefore probably represents a co-migrating e. coli protein.

since expression in e. coli culture resulted in accumulation of the recombinant protein in insoluble "inclusion bodies", purification of expressed chimera was performed by washing the pellets using a low urea concentration, followed by a high urea concentration for the extraction  processes. comparative studies showed that  <dig> mol/l urea solubilized approximately the 78% of recombinant protein ; lower concentrations of urea were less efficient  and were used for the washing steps. this approach achieves a good performance; since in the washed pellet the insoluble recombinant protein is retained while soluble e. coli proteins are washed out, providing a high grade of purification at the end of the process.

during the refolding process, realized by moving to a mild denaturating agent and finally to a physiological buffer, the reduced denatured protein recovers its active conformation, as demonstrated by protein ligand blots, where the active soluble chimera specifically bound radiolabed hu recombinant ifn-γ , as well as by biological activity tests . the main recombinant product is a  <dig> kda or  <dig> kda protein in non-reduced or reduced conditions, respectively, as recognized by anti-il- <dig> polyclonal antibody . shift in mobility of th <dig> antagonist between non-reducing and reduced eletrophoretic conditions is in correspondence with what has been reported for the soluble ifngr  <cit>  and for several other receptors  <cit>  and is consistent with a more compact structure of folded protein. polymeric and monomeric forms were detected, probably as a consequence of various alternative possibilities in the formation of disulfide bonds among the nine sulphydryl groups of the protein  <cit> . the anti-il- <dig> polyclonal antibody strongly recognized the rhu il- <dig> in western blots, while the chimera was recognized less intensely, likely due to the small il- <dig> fragment represented in the recombinant antagonist .

mass spectrometric analysis
the tryptic peptides esi-ms spectrum of th <dig> antagonist was obtained with a very good agreement between the molecular masses of the predicted proteolytic fragments and the experimental values. a summary of this comparison is shown in table  <dig>  three tryptic peptides containing some of the sixty n-terminal amino acids of hu il- <dig>  and the extracellular domain of ifngr <dig> were obtained . the peptide  that links both proteins was also detected in the esi-ms spectrum, confirming that a linker of four amino acids covalently binds these two proteins. the results shown in table  <dig>  account for  <dig> % sequence coverage, which is a satisfactory result in the verification of primary structures of proteins extracted from sds-page. the protein tryptic spectrometric analysis showed the presence of fragments corresponding to the il- <dig> n-terminal and ifn-γ extracellular regions confirming the presence of the components of chimeric protein. in order to obtain a further confirmation that this chimeric protein is present in the digested band, the peptides corresponding to the four most intense signals in the esi-ms spectrum  were sequenced. their esi-ms/ms spectra were manually interpreted and partial sequences introduced into the pepsea database search program. peptide  <dig>  is contained in the n-terminal end of hu il- <dig> whereas peptides  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  belong to ifngr <dig>  these two polypeptides are fused into a single polypeptide chain that migrates as a  <dig> kda band as demonstrated by sds-page . the aminoacid  sequence of the chimeric th <dig> antagonist protein is the following: .

the analyzed results are compatible with the recombinant chimeric antagonist protein comprising amino acids 1– <dig> from human il- <dig> n-terminal followed by a peptide followed by a peptide ala-hist-met-met  and the  <dig> aminoacids from the human ifngr <dig>  this protein contains one cysteine from il- <dig> n-terminal and  <dig> cysteine residues from ifngr <dig> extracellular region. for comparison, the chimeric protein sequence with the known il- <dig> and ifngr <dig> sequences see the following access numbers for il- <dig>  and for ifngr <dig> . the reported sequences in the pubmed databases include the amino acids sequences corresponding to signal peptide at the beginning of the sequences. it must be taken in account that, the cloned by us sequences correspond to the mature protein without signal peptide.

th <dig> chimeric antagonist biological activities
il- <dig> antagonist/agonistic action
the biological activity of the th <dig> antagonist protein was tested in vitro in an assay examining the capacity of the molecule to inhibit the proliferation of t cells in response to rhu il- <dig>  the descriptive statistic indicates that chimeric protein reduced the activity of il- <dig> corresponding to  <dig>  iu/ml , to  <dig>  iu/ml , a difference statistically significant with a p =  <dig>  . the chimera shares also il- <dig> agonistic action, as it sustained the growth of murine t cells dependent on exogenous il- <dig> . in this case, the absorbance measured during the proliferative assay for ctll- <dig> cells incubated with  <dig>  ng/ml of il- <dig> has a mean value of  <dig> , while for  <dig>  μg/ml of th <dig> antagonist molecule the absorbance was approximately the half .

as mentioned before, the high-affinity receptor for il- <dig> is composed of three subunits, il-2rα, il-2rβ and il-2rγ. moreover, the n-terminal il- <dig> region contains all the aminoacids interacting with the il-2rα subunit  and those contacting the il-2rβ subunit   <cit> . then the antagonism for the biological activity of il- <dig> could be explained by the interaction of il- <dig> regions in the fragment of the antagonist described as contacting with the indicated il- <dig> receptor subunits. probably the first sixty aminoacid of n-terminal region of il- <dig> can interfere with high-affinity binding of completely mature il- <dig> molecule to its membrane receptor. otherwise, in the absence of il- <dig>  the 60-aminoacid n-terminal il- <dig> fragment from th <dig> antagonist chimera might exert the il- <dig> agonistic activity. it has been reported that the n-terminal aminoacid stretch  from il- <dig> binds to il-2rβ and reproduce some of the il- <dig> biological functions, as lymphokine activated killer  cells activation, induction of ifn-γ production and t cell proliferation stimulation  <cit> . more work is needed to precisely demonstrate its dual effects.

th <dig> anatagonist neutralization of ifn-γ activities
in order to test for inhibition of antiproliferative action of rhu ifn-γ we used hep- <dig> cells, known to be highly susceptible to growth inhibition by ifn-γ. during antiproliferative activity assays  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml of ifn-γ inhibited the growth of hep- <dig> cells by approximately 60%. addition of  <dig> μg/ml of th <dig> antagonist to  <dig> or  <dig> iu/ml of ifn-γ fully restored proliferation of cells. neutralization of  <dig> iu/ml  was incomplete. the data demonstrated that the antagonist has the capacity to inhibit the antiproliferative action of ifn-γ. however, this effect is obtained at a low molar ratio. this may be due to the high sensitivity of the hep- <dig> cell line to growth inhibition of ifn-γ, as evidenced by the data of figure  <dig>  showing that  <dig> iu/ml of ifn-γ alone had almost a saturating antiproliferative effect on hep- <dig> cells.

treatment of colo  <dig> with ifn-γ resulted in the induction of a hla-dr, a class ii mhc antigen, one of the properties of ifn-γ that account for its immunomodulatory action. the stimulation of hla-dr expression by ifn-γ  was significantly regulated down  in the presence of the th <dig> antagonist  . thus, in the experiments designed to test the in vitro biological activities of recombinant th <dig> antagonist, the molecule inhibited the antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities of ifn-γ and the proliferate activity of il- <dig>  based on these in vitro biological activities, the antagonist demonstrated a high potential to interfere with the in vivo il- <dig> and ifn-γ functions during the activation of the immune system, a characteristic of the inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. nonetheless, in vivo immune response is essentially normal in mice lacking il- <dig> signaling  <cit> ; therefore, the antagonist may not strongly impact th <dig> response in regard to il- <dig> during early in immune response. however, the antagonist may influence later in the immune response because; il- <dig> contributes to t-cell immunity in vivo and seems to be more important during the later stages of immune responses. it has been shown to contribute to the type or magnitude of effectors cells that are produced and to be involved in its migration or proliferation in non-lymphoid tissue.

the th <dig> antagonist has other potentially useful characteristics. beside its capacity of interferes with il- <dig>  it shows il- <dig> agonistic activity, a property that during clinical application might allow to avoid deactivation of the immune system, an adverse effect that is characteristic of current anti-cytokine antagonists therapies, and favors the occurrence of opportunistic infections, demyelization and congestive heart failure  <cit> . furthermore, because il-2αr subunit is expressed only in activated t cells, the antagonist might be targeted mainly to this t cell subset or to cells expressing the il-2βr subunit. thereby, the agent might be concentrated in the extracellular milieu where activated t cells are abundant.

the agonistic function of the chimera may also offer the opportunity to promote the il- <dig> dependent regulatory function of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  t cells, which has been described as critical in the control of autoimmune diseases <cit> , in the absence of endogenous il- <dig> and likely interfere with it in the presence of high endogenous il- <dig> levels. nonetheless, the suppressive efficacy of tr cells isolated from mice subjected to various treatments correlated closely with suppression of ifn-γ and il- <dig> production by the cd25-effector t cells  <cit> . in vivo confirmation of these potential properties of th <dig> antagonist will offer new opportunities to treat several disease conditions accessible with this therapeutic approach.

CONCLUSIONS
we were able to construct and purified a recombinant chimeric antagonist composed by a  <dig> amino acid fragment of the n-terminal region of human il- <dig> fused to the n-terminal of the extracellular region of the alpha subunit of the gamma ifn-γ receptor was obtained. the chimeric protein conserves the physicochemical abilities of their components. this means, the ifn-γ receptor tail is able to recognize the ifn-γ and in correspondence neutralizes two biological activities of ifn-γ, its antiproliferative action on hep- <dig> cell line, and the stimulation of hla-dr in colo  <dig> cells. these data evidenced that the construction is compatible with the active conformation of the ifngr <dig> extracelluar region. others experiments confirmed that the il- <dig> fragment of  <dig> aminoacids from the il- <dig> n-terminal is in a correct conformation because elicit a classical well recognized property of il- <dig>  the stimulation of growth of cttl- <dig> cell line dependent on il- <dig> for growth and survival. the data evidenced and demonstrated that the components are functional in term of their structure as evidenced from the biological activities they have.
