BACKGROUND
endocytosis is an essential cellular process that regulates the delivery of specific cargo and lipid membranes to appropriate subcellular destinations  <cit> . endocytic traffic of signaling receptors into lysosomal versus recycling endosomal pathways also provides a fundamental mechanism to control cellular responses to environmental changes. finally, the endocytic pathway intersects other intracellular transport pathways such as the secretory pathway. understanding the molecular basis of regulated transport within the endocytic pathway is, therefore, of broad interest and substantial biological significance.

protein-protein interactions provide a central mechanism to control cellular functions, and regulatory proteins within a given functional pathway are often characterized by the presence of related modular protein-protein interaction domains. a large subset of proteins involved in the regulation of endocytic trafficking events contain an eps <dig> homology  <dig> domain, first identified as three repeated copies in the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate  <dig>   <cit> . there are over  <dig> eh domain-containing proteins known  <cit>  and many of them, such as eps <dig>  eps15r, intersectin, pob <dig>  end <dig> and reps <dig>  are involved in the early stages of endocytosis  <cit> . eh domains recognize an asn-pro-phe  motif within target proteins to assemble protein complexes that function at various steps during endocytic traffic, such as cargo selection and formation of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane  <cit> .

the recently identified subfamily of eh domain-containing proteins  are characterized by a unique domain organization distinct from other eh domain-bearing proteins: they contain a single eh domain at the c-terminus, a central coiled-coil region and a phosphate-binding loop  capable of binding nucleotides in the n-terminal region  <cit> . the genes encoding these proteins are located on different chromosomes, ehd <dig> on 11q <dig>  <cit> , ehd <dig> on 19q <dig> , ehd <dig> on 2p <dig> and ehd <dig> on 15q <dig> , yet they share a high degree of homology at the nucleotide and amino acid levels  <cit> . the presence of four ehd proteins in mammals appears to reflect recent duplications as a single gene is found in non-mammalian organisms  <cit> .

the presence of an eh domain suggests a possible role for these proteins in receptor-mediated endocytosis. consistent with this idea, mutations in receptor-mediated endocytosis- <dig>  led to defective endocytic traffic of the yolk protein receptor rme- <dig> as well as aberrant trafficking in intestinal cells leading to a vacuolated intestine phenotype in c. elegans  <cit> . rme- <dig> is most closely related to human ehd <dig>  <cit>  and it has been shown that ehd <dig> is involved in the recycling of a variety of receptors from the endocytic recycling compartment  to the plasma membrane  <cit> . previous studies have also shown that ehd <dig> and  <dig> reside in the erc as indicated by their colocalization with transferrin  <cit> . furthermore, perturbations of ehd <dig> and  <dig> led to altered distribution and function of the erc  <cit> . other ehd proteins have been studied in specialized cells such as adipocytes and pheochromocytoma cells. ehd <dig> was isolated from glut4-enriched fractions of adipocytes and shown to regulate insulin-mediated translocation of glut <dig> to the plasma membrane  <cit> . ehd <dig>  also called pincher, has been shown to regulate neurotrophin receptor trka endocytosis in pheochromocytoma  cells  <cit> .

several ehd-binding proteins have been identified recently such as rabenosyn- <dig>  <cit> , snap29/gs <dig>  <cit> , syndapin i and ii  <cit> , α-adaptin subunit of ap <dig>  <cit> , reticulon   <cit> , rab11-fip <dig>  <cit> , ehbp <dig>  <cit>  and numb  <cit> ; many of these contain one or more npf motifs  <cit> . biochemical studies and yeast two-hybrid experiments have shown that mutations in the p-loop and coiled-coil region interfere with oligomerization of rme-1/ehd <dig>  <cit>  and ehd <dig>  <cit> . despite the emerging information on their role in endocytic recycling of different receptors and identification of their interaction partners, little is known about ehd proteins and how they function in cells.

while these initial studies have begun to establish the role of ehd proteins in endocytic traffic, in particular at the erc, there has been a distinct lack of biochemical and functional comparisons of mammalian ehd proteins in a single cellular system. as suggested by naslavsky and caplan, the overall identity of ehd proteins is slightly higher than that of their eh domains  <cit>  and the comparison of all human ehd proteins in parallel could, therefore, provide important clues to their function in mammalian cells. here, we have compared the four human ehd proteins with respect to their expression, localization and function to identify their distinct and shared cellular functions. these studies, together with recent comparison of ehd <dig> and  <dig> by the caplan group  <cit> , should serve as a basis for further efforts to understand the molecular basis of ehd protein function.

RESULTS
the four mammalian ehd proteins are highly related in sequence as well as domain structure  <cit> . however, it is not clear whether they have distinct roles in mammalian cells, perform similar function in different cellular contexts or are, to some degree, redundant in function. to begin to address these issues, we have carried out simultaneous biochemical and functional analyses of human ehd1- <dig> both through reconstitution of function in the c. elegans mutant rme- <dig>  in which the single ehd ortholog rme- <dig> is mutated, and by expression in mammalian cells.

all human ehd proteins rescue the defective rme- <dig> function in the intestine of c. elegans rme-1
the role of ehd proteins in endocytic recycling was first revealed by the isolation of c. elegans ehd ortholog rme- <dig> as a regulator of endocytosis  <cit> . among the various defects, rme- <dig> mutants were shown to develop large vacuoles in the intestine at the larval l <dig> stage which increased in number with age. these vacuoles accumulate fluid phase markers within minutes of application to the basolateral surface, but not when applied to the apical surface, indicating that they arise from a specific basolateral trafficking defect  <cit> . rme- <dig> is most closely related to mammalian ehd <dig>  and gfp-rme- <dig> and -ehd <dig> formed similar vesicular structures and colocalized with transferrin in chinese hamster ovary  cells  <cit> . given the overall conservation among mammalian ehd proteins, we used mutant c. elegans with anon-functional ehd ortholog in a cross-species complementation strategy to test if all or selected human ehd proteins function to regulate endocytic trafficking.

since the deletion mutant allele rme- <dig>  was shown to lack any detectable rme- <dig> protein and did not appear to be dominant-negative  <cit> , we chose this allele for our rescue experiments. the vacuolated intestinal phenotype is a suitable assay system since it is easy to score and has been successfully used to identify a novel gene involved in endocytic recycling in intestinal cells  <cit> . the human ehd cdnas were cloned into an expression vector driven by the intestine-specific vha- <dig> promoter  <cit>  with an ires sequence separating the ehd gene from the coding sequence of a gfp marker. this allowed easy scoring of the vacuoles as circular regions devoid of green fluorescence . similar to the rme- <dig> animals, which had an average of  <dig> ±  <dig>  vacuoles per animal, gfp-expressing transgenic rme- <dig> animals  had an average of  <dig> ±  <dig>  vacuoles per animal . wild type  animals never developed intestinal vacuoles. as expected from the close structural similarity with rme- <dig>  expression of human ehd <dig> was able to rescue the vacuolated intestinal phenotype comparable to that observed with prme-1::gfp-rme- <dig> construct   <cit> . notably, we observed that the other human ehd proteins could also rescue the intestinal phenotype to an extent comparable to that seen with ehd <dig> . to further examine the rescue of the basolateral trafficking defect, we injected the fluid phase marker texas red-bsa  into the psuedocoelom. the tr-bsa accumulated within one minute of injection in the intestinal vacuoles of rme- <dig> animals . in wild type animals, no accumulation of tr-bsa was observed reflecting the efficient recycling back to the pseudocoelom of the basolaterally endocytosed fluid phase markers   <cit> . as expected, rescued rme- <dig> animals did not accumulate any tr-bsa similar to wild type animals, indicating that the basolateral trafficking defect was rescued in these worms . when tr-bsa was presented via the apical surface using feeding, it did not accumulate in the vacuoles in either the mutant or the rescued worms indicating that apical endocytosis and recycling were unaffected in these worms . collectively, these experiments indicate that human ehd proteins retain the basic function of their c. elegans ortholog to control endocytic trafficking.

all human ehd proteins are concurrently expressed in multiple cultured cell lines and several tissues
rescue of defective endocytic recycling in mutant worms by all human ehd proteins strongly suggested that these proteins might participate in regulation of the endocytic pathway in mammalian cells. the emergence of multiple rme- <dig> orthologs  in higher mammalian organisms could reflect tissue-specific expression or further functional diversification as a result of distinct localization or interaction with specific protein partners. therefore, we checked whether all ehd proteins or only selected members are expressed concurrently in a given mammalian cell. previously, ehd-encoding mrnas were detected in various human tissues  <cit> , but concurrent endogenous ehd protein expression has only been recently shown for hela cells and suggested for normal mouse fibroblasts  <cit> . to assess endogenous ehd protein expression in a broader array of human cell lines, we developed and characterized rabbit anti-peptide antisera that specifically recognize individual human ehd proteins based on selective immunoblotting of exogenously expressed ehd-gfp proteins in hek 293t cells . western blots of endogenous proteins using these antibodies demonstrated that each of the  <dig> selected human cell lines expressed all four ehd proteins . analysis of nearly fifteen additional cell lines confirmed this general conclusion . endogenous ehd proteins were also detected in mouse tissue extracts using the same antibodies . all ehd proteins are expressed in most tissues tested, although their levels varied between tissues. for example, ehd <dig> is highly expressed in kidney and brain, whereas, ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are highly expressed in lung, heart and spleen. tissue-specific levels of expression may point to differences in their functions.

all human ehd proteins form homo- and hetero-oligomers but ehd <dig> is relatively deficient in hetero-oligomerization
ehd proteins contain coiled-coil domains thought to be involved in oligomerization. yeast two-hybrid interaction and mammalian cell co-expression studies have demonstrated the existence of rme-1/ehd <dig> homo-oligomers and ehd1/ <dig> hetero-oligomers  <cit> . a functional p-loop and coiled-coil region are required for oligomerization and are essential for rme- <dig> and ehd <dig> function  <cit> . no such information is available for ehd <dig> and ehd <dig>  one possible means for functional heterogeneity among ehd proteins could be their differential ability to form homo- and hetero-oligomers with other ehd proteins in a given cell. in order to assess the ability of human ehd proteins to form homo- and hetero-oligomers, we co-transfected myc- and gfp-tagged ehd proteins in hek 293t cells and assessed the presence of the ehd-gfp partner in anti-myc immunoprecipitates. all ehd proteins formed homo-oligomers when gfp- and myc-tagged forms of the same ehd protein were co-expressed . furthermore, ehd <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with each of the other three ehd proteins both when myc-ehd <dig> was co-expressed with gfp-tagged ehd <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  or when ehd1-gfp was co-expressed with myc-tagged ehd <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  co-immunoprecipitation  of myc-ehd <dig> with gfp-tagged form of itself or ehd <dig> was always robust, whereas its co-ip with ehd2- or 3-gfp was always detectable but varied in extent. the co-ip of ehd <dig> with ehd <dig> or  <dig> proteins was substantially lower when compared to other oligomeric combinations, indicating that ehd <dig> may primarily exist as either a homo-oligomer or a hetero-oligomer with ehd <dig> or that it may be present in a different compartment. differential co-ip was not due to differences in the expression of proteins as revealed by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates . similar results were obtained using hela cells . the general pattern of co-ip in homo- and hetero-oligomeric combinations was similar when myc-tagged eh domain deletion  mutants of ehd proteins were co-expressed with full-length gfp-tagged proteins  indicating that the oligomerization of the human ehd proteins are independent of their eh domain.

that co-ips were not due to non-specific interactions of overexpressed proteins was demonstrated by the lack of co-immuniprecipitation of gfp-myotubularian-related protein  <dig>  when co-transfected with myc-ehd <dig> and by the lack of co-ip of myc-sorting nexin- <dig>  co-transfected with ehd1-gfp . when the primary sequences of human ehd proteins were analyzed using coils , we observed that amino acids 195– <dig> of ehd <dig> and  <dig> showed a strong tendency to form coiled-coils, with lower scores for ehd <dig> and  <dig> . this is in general agreement with our co-ip results. thus, while all human ehd proteins are capable of homo- and hetero-oligomerization, they differ in their choice of oligomerization partners within the same cellular milieu with preference for certain homo- and hetero-oligomeric combinations. here, we show for the first time using co-ip analyses that all overexpressed human ehd proteins form homo- and hetero-oligomers with one another in mammalian cells. while endogenous co-ips from cell lysates have not been successful thus far , possibly due to uneven co-expression, our initial analyses of mouse tissue extracts using anti-human ehd <dig> antibodies indeed show co-ip of ehd <dig> with ehd <dig> or ehd <dig>  supporting the likelihood that endogenous ehd proteins do oligomerize.

human ehd-gfp proteins localize to tubulovesicular structures in hela cells
previous studies have shown that wild type human ehd <dig> and ehd <dig> as well as the c. elegans rme- <dig> protein expressed in mammalian cells localize to tubulovesicular endocytic structures that include the erc, although localization to additional vesicular structures was also noted  <cit> . notably, the endocytic localization was completely lost in the loss-of-function p-loop mutants  <cit> . therefore, we compared the subcellular localization patterns of human ehd proteins within a single cellular background to assess any differences in their localization. when gfp-tagged human ehd proteins were transfected into hela cells, we observed that ehd <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were present in pleomorphic tubulovesicular structures in the perinuclear area, and in some cells these structures extended toward the periphery . all transfected cells showed vesicular structures, but tubular structures varied greatly in number between cells and were entirely absent in some cells. a movie of an ehd1-gfp-transfected cell shows that these structures are dynamic; this is true of other ehd transfected structures . in contrast, ehd2-gfp lacked perinuclear tubular structures and showed punctate vesicular staining throughout the cytoplasm. in addition, ehd <dig> was also observed at the plasma membrane where it often displayed a pattern of microspikes . comparable differences between ehd2-gfp and other gfp-tagged ehd proteins were observed upon transfection of cho cells and immortal human mammary epithelial cell line mcf10a .

ehd proteins variably colocalize with each other
we further assessed the colocalization of ehd proteins by co-expressing their gfp- and dsred-tagged forms in hela cells. comparison of gfp- versus the dsred-tagged versions of each protein showed that different tags did not alter their overall patterns of localization, a conclusion further borne out by co-expressing the two tagged versions of the same protein . importantly, ehd <dig> showed substantial colocalization with ehd <dig> and  <dig> and vice versa. in contrast, ehd <dig> showed little, if any, colocalization with ehd <dig> or  <dig> but showed partial colocalization with ehd <dig>  since the expression pattern of individual tagged ehd proteins did not appear to differ when expressed individually or with other ehd proteins , it appears unlikely that overexpression of one protein affects the expression pattern of the other. in the case of ehd <dig>  we observed tubular and vesicular structures when it was overexpressed alone or with ehd <dig> and 3; however, when co-overexpressed with ehd <dig>  ehd <dig> was primarily observed in larger vesicular structures.

earlier studies with individual ehd proteins have shown an important functional role of the eh domain. overexpression of ehd <dig> g429r, a mutation that is proposed to alter the conformation of the eh domain  <cit> , in cho and hela cells led to an altered appearance and function of the erc apparently reflecting a dominant-negative phenotype of this mutant  <cit> . therefore, we constructed gfp-tagged Δeh mutants of each ehd protein, expressed them in hela cells and assessed their localization relative to the wild type versions. ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> Δeh-gfp mutants accumulated in prominent vesicular structures of varying sizes in the perinuclear region; these vesicular structures were quite large in cells expressing ehd <dig> Δeh-gfp . in contrast, the localization of the ehd <dig> Δeh-gfp was similar to that of the wild type ehd2-gfp protein. these experiments complement our co-ip results and suggest that localization and oligomerization of ehd proteins may play an important role in their function.

effects of ehd protein expression on rab <dig> localization
small gtpases of the rab family have characteristic cellular distributions and are known to regulate membrane traffic between different vesicular compartments  <cit>  and some have been implicated in the control of trafficking within the endocytic pathway  <cit> . of these, rab <dig> is an important marker of the erc as well as a regulator of transport through the erc. given the localization and apparent regulatory role of ehd proteins in the erc  <cit> , it appeared likely that these proteins may affect rab <dig> function. we therefore assessed if ehd proteins colocalized with rab <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for this purpose, we co-expressed dsred-tagged ehd proteins and gfp-tagged rab proteins in hela cells. we observed that ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed partial colocalization with rab <dig> while ehd <dig> and rab <dig> did not colocalize . we could not detect significant colocalization of ehd proteins with any of the other rab proteins tested . the incomplete colocalization of ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with rab <dig> could reflect the dynamic state of vesicles on which these proteins colocalize, with rapid fusion and budding events allowing only partial colocalization at any given time point. therefore, we used live cell imaging of hela cells co-transfected with ehd1-dsred and rab11-gfp to assess if rab <dig> and ehd proteins show dynamic colocalization. indeed, rab11-positive  and ehd1-positive  vesicles were seen moving toward each other with transient coalescence of the green and red fluorescence  followed by rapid return to green and red . these results indicate that rab <dig> and ehd <dig> colocalization reflects a dynamic state.

we also examined the effect of expressing myc-ehd Δeh mutants in hela cells on rab11-gfp localization. while none of the Δeh mutants showed significant colocalization with rab11-gfp, the expression of ehd <dig> and  <dig> Δeh mutants resulted in a dramatic clustering of rab <dig> in the perinuclear area  which was not seen when rab11-gfp was co-transfected with wild type ehd proteins . in contrast, ehd <dig> and  <dig> Δeh mutants did not produce noticeable alterations in rab <dig> localization. thus, it appears that some ehd proteins might act along with rab <dig> in the same recycling pathway while others might not, raising the possibility that different ehd proteins may affect a common functional pathway through distinct mechanisms.

effect of ehd protein overexpression on transferrin trafficking
exit of internalized transferrin out of the erc has been commonly used as an assay of erc function  <cit> . indeed, the first evidence for the role of ehd <dig> in mammalian endocytic transport employed the ability of ehd <dig> g429r mutant to delay transferrin exit from the erc  <cit> . several recent studies have addressed the role of ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in regulating endocytic recycling but the picture remains confusing due to the different transferrin receptor recycling assays used  <cit> . therefore, we compared the effects of myc-tagged wild type and myc-ehd Δeh proteins on transferrin recycling using a single assay  <cit>  so that any differences could be ascribed to the proteins being studied rather than differences in methodology. hela cells transiently transfected with wild type or Δeh mutants were allowed to internalize and accumulate fluorescently-labelled transferrin in the erc and then chased with unlabeled transferrin for various time points. in untransfected cells, essentially no cells showed residual transferrin in the erc at  <dig> min of chase . cells transfected with wild-type ehd proteins showed a retardation of transferrin exit from the erc at  <dig> min of chase . furthermore, ehd <dig> and  <dig> Δeh produced an even stronger effect compared to their wild type forms while the ehd <dig> mutant showed a milder effect . in contrast, the effect of ehd <dig> mutant was comparable to the wild type protein . thus, overexpression of wild type as well as Δeh mutants appeared to perturb transferrin exit from the erc. notably, ehd <dig> behaved differently compared to other ehd proteins in this assay. in contrast to a previous report, we did not observe any defects of transferrin endocytosis in ehd2-transfected cells  <cit>  . however, as reported by naslavsky et al., the block on transferrin exit in our studies was quite modest  <cit> .

effect of sirna-mediated knock-down of ehd proteins on transferrin recycling
in order to confirm the role of ehd proteins in transferrin recycling, we used sirna-mediated knock-down of ehd proteins in hela cells and examined transferrin loading in these cells. the specificity of the ehd knock-down is shown in additional file 6a. while ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sirna resulted in a moderate reduction  in protein levels , ehd <dig> knock-down using sirna sequences from naslavsky et al.  <cit>  showed only a modest reduction in protein levels in our hands  but showed an identical transferrin phenotype as published for ehd <dig> . as shown in figure 10a, ehd <dig> sirna caused the accumulation of transferrin-containing vesicles in the perinuclear area, in accordance with the observations made previously using identical sirna sequences for ehd <dig>  <cit> . ehd <dig> sirna induced a perinuclear transferrin accumulation phenotype similar to ehd <dig> sirna, while ehd <dig> sirna induced a peripheral transferrin accumulation phenotype, similar to the early endosome phenotype published for ehd <dig> knock-down  <cit>  .

naslavasky et al. have previously reported the characterization of the compartment in which transferrin accumulates following ehd <dig> knock-down  <cit> . these investigators showed that early endosomal antigen  <dig> and rab <dig> were absent from the perinuclear region in ehd <dig> knock-down cells and instead these markers colocalized with transferrin in enlarged peripheral early endosome  structures  <cit> . we transfected ehd <dig> knock-down cells with rab5-gfp and observed that rab5-gfp was excluded from the perinuclear area and colocalized with transferrin in the periphery indicating that these are indeed early endosomes . further, we colocalized rab11-gfp with the perinuclear vesicular structures that accumulate transferrin in cells with ehd <dig> and  <dig> knock-down, indicating that they are the erc . in addition, we observed that cells with ehd <dig> sirna showed clustering of rab11-gfp in the perinuclear area similar to cells overexpressing the ehd <dig> Δeh mutant . furthermore, confirming results published by the caplan group, we noted that sirna-mediated ehd <dig> knock-down resulted in the exclusion of rab <dig> from the erc   <cit> ; notably, ehd <dig> sirna had a similar effect on rab11-gfp localization . these experiments confirm that ehd <dig> and  <dig> knock-down result in the accumulation of transferrin in the erc  and ehd <dig> knock-down results in the accumulation of transferrin in the ee compartment .

we also performed a transferrin recycling assay on these cells where labelled transferrin was loaded and chased for different time points. this assay allowed visualization of the compartment in which transferrin was trapped as it became demarcated during the course of the chase. knock-down of ehd <dig> resulted in retention of considerable proportions of transferrin at  <dig> min of chase when compared to the irrelevant sirna control . cells with ehd <dig> knock-down retained less transferrin during the chase when compared to ehd <dig> knock-down yielding an intermediate phenotype while ehd <dig> knock-down had little effect as compared to the irrelevant sirna control. knock-down of ehd <dig> resulted in prolonged retention of transferrin in a perinuclear compartment while ehd <dig> knock-down led to retention in a peripheral compartment . the transferrin loading and recycling assays confirm that ehd <dig> and  <dig> function in the erc to regulate transferrin recycling, with ehd <dig> being a dominant regulator, while ehd <dig> regulates transferrin exit out of the ee. the lack of an effect on transferrin recycling with ehd <dig> knock-down seen here is in agreement with our results using the ehd <dig> Δeh construct suggesting that ehd <dig> functions at a location in the erc where it exerts minimal effects on transferrin recycling. irrelevant sirna also seemed to affect transferrin recycling at  <dig> min but was comparable to untransfected cells at  <dig> min of chase. while it is not presently feasible to demonstrate concurrent knock-down of multiple ehd proteins in individual cells while showing the transferrin phenotype, generation of single and multiple ehd knock-out cells derived from mice with targeted deletions of ehd proteins will allow future analyses to address the authenticity of the phenotypes seen here.

discussion
to determine whether all ehd proteins had a functional role in endocytic trafficking, we took advantage of the availability of a c. elegans mutant in which the ehd ortholog rme- <dig> was non-functional. we found that all ehd proteins could rescue the basolateral trafficking defect in the intestine of mutant worms and thus demonstrate for the first time that all ehd proteins retain an ancestral endocytic recycling function . analysis of multiple cell lines indicate that ehd1- <dig> proteins are co-expressed in several human cell lines concurrently . moreover, ehd proteins were found to be ubiquitously expressed in the mouse tissues analyzed, albeit with tissue-specific differences in protein levels . given that all four human ehd proteins function in our c. elegans rescue experiments, their co-expression in mammalian cells  suggests that either mammalian ehd proteins play a functionally redundant role in endocytic recycling or that they have attained additional paralog-specific functions. as discussed below, our findings suggest that ehd proteins play both redundant and specific roles.

yeast two-hybrid studies as well as co-expression in mammalian cells indicate that ehd <dig> and  <dig> form homo- and hetero-oligomers  <cit> ; this process is mediated by a functional p-loop and coiled-coil domain, and is independent of the eh domain  <cit> . however, oligomerization of ehd <dig> and  <dig> have not been previously examined using co-ip analyses. in our analyses, we found that each ehd protein homo- and hetero-oligomerized, however, hetero-oligomerization between ehd proteins was variable. for example, ehd <dig> oligomerized weakly with ehd <dig> and  <dig> . consistent with observations that the eh domain is not required for oligomerization  <cit> , the Δeh mutants oligomerized similar to wild type ehd proteins . our results provide the first complete analysis of the oligomerization capabilities of ehd proteins in mammalian cells using a co-ip strategy. these results broadly agree with the predicted coiled-coil structure deduced for each protein . co-ip of endogenous ehd <dig> and  <dig> in mouse tissue lysates using anti-ehd <dig> antibodies supports the likelihood that oligomerization is physiologically relevant. since ehd <dig> and  <dig> have been shown to bind to npf-containing proteins in an oligomerization-dependent  and -independent manner   <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that oligomerization might not only influence membrane binding but also the selection of protein interaction partners.

the results of our colocalization analyses in hela cells mirrored the co-ip results: ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> substantially colocalized while ehd <dig> showed partial colocalization with ehd <dig> and little colocalization with ehd <dig> and  <dig> . while it is possible that the localization of individual ehd proteins might change upon co-overexpression of other ehd proteins, this appears relatively unlikely since ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> did not appear to change their pattern of localization when expressed with each other; however, ehd <dig> structures did appear to change upon co-expression with ehd <dig>  in further support of the differential endocytic localization of ehd proteins, we observed that ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> partially colocalized with rab <dig> while ehd <dig> showed minimal colocalization . interestingly, even though ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> colocalized with rab <dig>  dramatic perinuclear clustering of rab11-gfp-positive vesicles only occurred upon overexpression of ehd <dig> Δeh and  <dig> Δeh mutants  suggesting that ehd <dig> and  <dig> may function in the same recycling pathway upstream of rab <dig> . we were unable to detect any direct association between ehd proteins and rab <dig> upon co-ip analysis  similar to a previous report  <cit> . knock-down of ehd <dig> induced the perinuclear clustering of rab11-gfp similar to that of overexpression of ehd <dig> Δeh, however, we were unable to test whether this was the case with ehd <dig> knock-down due to the inefficiency of ehd <dig> knock-down .

a recent study showed that ehd <dig> and  <dig> interact with rab11-fip <dig>  a rab <dig> interacting protein, via eh-npf interactions, and recruit rab11-fip <dig> to ehd-containing membranes in a p-loop and coiled-coil domain-dependent manner; however, the authors were unable to show an interaction between rab <dig> and either ehd <dig> or  <dig>  <cit> . rab11-fip <dig> binds to both the gdp- and gtp-bound forms of rab <dig> and is thought to recruit rab <dig> to the membrane  <cit> . we hypothesize that ehd <dig> and  <dig> Δeh mutants might interfere with their wild type protein function since they might not bind to npf motifs on rab11-fip <dig>  since oligomerization of ehd <dig> and  <dig> was shown to be required for rab11-fip <dig> binding  <cit> , the lower propensity for ehd <dig> and  <dig> to hetero-oligomerize might spare rab11-fip <dig> function leading to the inability of ehd <dig> and  <dig> Δeh mutants to induce rab <dig> clustering. it will be of great interest to assess whether ehd <dig> and  <dig> interact with rab11-fip <dig> 

our analyses of the impact of ehd proteins on transferrin exit from the erc revealed that overexpression of wild type ehd proteins retarded this process . while paradoxical, this finding is not unprecedented, as overexpression of other proteins involved in endocytic traffic, such as rififylin, the ring finger and fyve-like domain erc protein, also led to a block in transferrin recycling  <cit>  perhaps due to disruption of functional protein complexes and/or sequestration of effector proteins. overexpression of ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> Δeh mutants further increased the transferrin exit block while that of ehd <dig> Δeh did not .

the role of ehd proteins in transferrin trafficking was further clarified by the use of sirna-mediated ehd knock-down. transferrin loading and recycling experiments in sirna-transfected cells revealed that all ehd proteins regulate transferrin trafficking , in agreement with the results of the dominant-negative mutant approach. these experiments together with published studies on ehd <dig>  <cit>  allow the classification of ehd proteins into two groups based on their effects on transferrin: ehd <dig> and  <dig> appear to regulate exit of transferrin out of the erc and hence are erc regulators  while ehd <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> function in the ee and hence are ee regulators. our results in this regard confirm the studies of the caplan group using ehd <dig> and  <dig> knock-down but extend these to ehd <dig> and  <dig> 

our biochemical and functional analyses of ehd proteins together with recent studies from other groups lead to a speculative model depicted in figure  <dig>  the four ehd proteins are differentially distributed within the recycling pathway with ehd <dig> and  <dig> functional in the ee and ehd <dig> and  <dig> in the erc. at these locations, they could interact through their conserved eh domains with either similar or diverse npf-containing partners. distinct oligomers, formed as a result of preferential oligomerization through coiled-coils, could also mediate the recruitment of different eh domain binding partners in each compartment conferring a degree of selectivity to ehd function. for example, the presence of an apparently non-redundant ehd  in the recycling endosome might help direct traffic into rab11-dependent and -independent pathways and increase the versatility of recycling at the erc. further biochemical, cell biological and genetic studies on this conserved family of proteins will lead to an improved understanding of the endocytic recycling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our biochemical and functional analyses of the human ehd proteins, members of a newly identified eh domain-containing protein family, indicate that they share an ancestral function of regulating endocytic recycling. studies using dominant negative mutants and sirna unravelled some important differences between the members, ehd <dig> and  <dig> regulate recycling at the erc while ehd <dig> and  <dig> regulate ee to erc transport. overall, ehd <dig> appears to be the most divergent member with respect to localization and functions that we tested, while ehd <dig> seemed to be intermediate between ehd1/ <dig> and ehd <dig>  as mentioned previously, ehd <dig> and  <dig> have been predominantly studied in specific cell types such as adipocytes and pheochromocytoma cells, respectively. however, all four ehd proteins have not been compared concurrently in a single cell type. the contrast between the common ancestral endocytic trafficking function indicated by the c. elegans experiments and differences among ehd proteins revealed by studies in hela cells suggest that ehd proteins have functionally diversified during their recent evolution to match the versatility demanded by the complexity of endocytic traffic in mammalian cells. further, comparative biochemical and cell biological studies of the ehd protein family between mammalian and non-mammalian systems should, therefore, facilitate our understanding of these conserved endocytic regulators, as well as provide new insights into the functional diversity of mammalian endocytic compartments. ehd <dig> knock-out mice have been generated recently and do not display any abnormality other than slower transferrin recycling in isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts; possibly, indicating the overall redundancy of the ehd protein family  <cit> . availability of single and multiple knock-out mice should further help to delineate ehd function along various steps in the recycling pathway.
