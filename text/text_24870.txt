BACKGROUND
proteases are an important class of enzymes involved in a diverse range of physiological processes. the modulation of proteolytic activity is an established means of therapeutic intervention with currently marketed products for afflictions as diverse as type  <dig> diabetes, hypertension and viral infections. the human protease tree is comprised of at least  <dig> diverse proteins that have been systematically organized into clans and families based on similarity in sequence, structure, and function  <cit> . although the structural basis of catalytic mechanism, substrate specificity and rational drug design has been identified for numerous protease families, there has been no structural description of the s <dig> family of proteases that form a distinct branch of the serine carboxypeptidase clan.

the s <dig> family of peptidases consists of two enzymes, prcp and dpp <dig>  dpp <dig> is also called dipeptidyl peptidase  <dig> and quiescent cell proline dipeptidase  <cit> . prcp is a lysosomal, serine carboxypeptidase that cleaves hydrophobic c-terminal amino acids adjacent to proline  <cit> . in contrast, dpp <dig> is a serine dipeptidyl aminopeptidase that cleaves n-terminal amino acids adjacent to proline and is localized to intracellular vesicles  <cit> .

human prcp and human dpp <dig> share  <dig> % sequence identity and  <dig> % sequence similarity. at the sequence level, the two enzymes are unrelated to other proteases; the next closest human homologues are pep  and dpp <dig> . the s <dig> proteases prcp and dpp <dig> are therefore unique within the protease superfamily.

prcp was originally discovered as an angiotensinase  <cit>  and has since been implicated in vasodilatory, proinflammatory, and metabolic pathways  <cit> . for example, angiotensin ii, iii and prekallikrein are all inactivated by prcp, implicating a role for the enzyme in hypertension, tissue proliferation and smooth muscle growth. prcp is also reported to inactivate α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, a neuropeptide that plays a role in regulating appetite  <cit> . dpp <dig> has been implicated in apoptosis in quiescent lymphocytes  <cit> .

here we report the crystal structure of human prcp. the enzyme consists of an α/β hydrolase domain that contains a unique structural domain insertion that caps the active site. comparison with the recently released coordinates of dpp <dig> illuminates the structural basis for the different substrate specificities of prcp and dpp <dig>  the results lay the foundation for understanding the structural basis of prcp activity and for the structure-guided discovery of prcp modulators for target validation and disease modification.

RESULTS
the structure of prcp
the crystal structure of human prcp was determined using miras phasing techniques at  <dig>  Å resolution by analyzing native, mercury and platinum-derivatized crystals . interpretation of heavy-atom positions and resultant electron-density maps show that the asymmetric unit contains one molecule of prcp with an unusually high solvent content of 82%. although the derivative data sets provided modest amounts of phase information, a very high-quality experimental electron density map was obtained. these results reflect the high redundancy of the data and high solvent content of the crystals.

values in parentheses are for the highest resolution bin.

the experimental maps allowed nearly the entire structure of prcp to be modeled and subsequently refined. the final refined model consists of residues 46- <dig> and 353- <dig>  five n-linked glycans, and four disulfide bridges . the final r and rfree values are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. geometry and stereochemistry are good with 95% of the residues in the most favored region of the ramachandran plot and an overall molprobity score of 88%. one region of unexplained tubular electron density is observed in the s1' active site area that may correspond to a structurally heterogeneous population of bound polymer  and a second peak of unexplained electron density is observed near the putative proline s <dig> binding site.

the overall architecture of prcp consists of two main structural entities: an α/β hydrolase domain and a novel sks domain . the α/β hydrolase domain is constructed from two non-contiguous stretches of prcp . although a number of β-sheet topologies have been described for the α/β hydrolase fold  <cit> , the β-sheet topology of prcp is identical to the prototypical α/β hydrolase fold  <cit> .

the unique insertion in the prcp hydrolase domain occurs between strand  <dig> and helix d and spans residues 194- <dig>  the first part of the insertion  consists of five helices packed into a novel helical bundle  that caps the active site . a dali search to identify structures containing similar helical bundles to the sks domain did not identify proteins with similar folds , suggesting that the sks domain is a novel structural motif.

four residues following the sks domain are likely disordered as evidenced by a lack of electron density . the region is followed by a pair of helices  that are linked by two long, irregular, loosely packed strands that form a concave surface at one entrance to the active site. the irregular strands and the m and n helices appear to provide additional stabilizing interactions between the sks and hydrolase domains and form part of the substrate binding surface .

previously reported mass-spectrometry results are consistent with the cho-expressed prcp protein containing about  <dig> kda of glycan  <cit> . sequence analysis suggests that there are six possible n-glycosylation sites at asparagines  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that correspond to the canonical glycosylation sequence asn-xaa-ser/thr  <cit> . asn  <dig> is not glycosylated in the structure, in accord with mass-spectrometric mapping of glycan sites  <cit> . clear evidence of covalently attached and ordered saccharide is observed at the other five canonical glycosylation sites . the presence of extensive glycosylation is likely a contributing factor to the high solvent content of the crystals.

a crystallographic dimerization interface is seen that involves the hydrolase domain . the dimer interface is formed through packing interactions across a two-fold crystallographic symmetry axis present in the crystal, and buries approximately  <dig> Å <dig> of surface area on the combined molecules of prcp. this observation is consistent with previous gel-filtration and dynamic-light scattering results suggesting that prcp is a dimer in solution  <cit> .

the active site of prcp
the catalytic triad consisting of ser  <dig>  asp  <dig> and his  <dig>  can be identified based on structural similarity with other hydrolases  <cit> . ser  <dig> is located on a sharp turn between strand  <dig> and helix c, asp  <dig> is located between strand  <dig> and helix e, and his  <dig> is located on the loop between strand  <dig> and helix f. ser  <dig>  asp  <dig> and his  <dig> are spatially oriented in the same catalytic triad arrangement seen in other serine α/β hydrolases such as dpp <dig> . the active site is located on one face of the hydrolase domain and is capped by the sks domain. the putative oxyanion hole is formed by the backbone amide nitrogen atoms of tyr  <dig> and gly  <dig>  the side chain of asn  <dig> is also positioned in close proximity to the putative oxyanion hole and may play a role in stabilizing the negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate formed during catalysis. other proteases containing the hydrolase fold adopt a similar arrangement of the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole, although the nature of the capping domain varies. for example, dpp <dig> and pep are capped with a β-propeller domain  <cit>  and human protective protein is capped with a helical bundle unrelated to the sks domain  <cit> .

an unanticipated feature of the prcp active site is an apparent charge-relay system that links the catalytic histidine  with his  <dig> and arg  <dig> . the arrangement of side chains places the imidazole nitrogen atoms of his  <dig> and his  <dig> within  <dig> - <dig>  Å of the catalytic serine. the guanidinium group of arg  <dig> is in hydrogen bond distance  of the imidazole ring of his  <dig>  it seems likely that this unique arrangement of residues plays a role in the catalytic mechanism of prcp. furthermore, it is possible that the presence of the formally charged arg  <dig> in close contact with the tandem histidines could alter the pka of his  <dig> contributing to the acidic ph optimum  for both prcp and dpp <dig>  <cit> .

the tandem his-his arrangement is not seen in other serine α/β hydrolases with the exception of the lipases. for example, pancreatic lipase  <cit> , contains a second histidine residue located spatially adjacent to the catalytic histidine in the active site . in the lipases, the equivalent second his residue is contributed to the active site by a different structural element of the α/β hydrolase fold, and may therefore represent a convergent evolution of the s <dig> protease family and the lipases. the structural conservation underscores the potential importance of the histidine pair in catalysis.

recognition of pro-x peptide substrates by prcp
prcp cleaves carboxy-terminal residues of peptide substrates that contain a penultimate proline. this is exemplified by angiotensin ii, the first substrate identified for prcp   <cit>  and bradykinin   <cit> . in contrast, peptides lacking the penultimate pro, such as angiotensin i , are not substrates for the enzyme  <cit> .

examination of the active site for potential substrate recognition pockets reveals the presence of a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the catalytic serine. this pocket is formed primarily by met  <dig>  met  <dig>  trp  <dig> and trp  <dig> . the proline s <dig> binding site of other proline peptidases is illustrated by pep and dpp <dig>  which share limited sequence similarity to prcp and to each other . the structure of substrate-bound pep  <cit>  shows that the pro residue of the cleaved substrate  is located in a hydrophobic pocket formed by trp  <dig> and phe  <dig> that is adjacent to the catalytic serine . similarly, the structure of dpp <dig> with a bound peptide substrate shows that the substrate proline is recognized in a pocket formed by tyr  <dig> and tyr  <dig> . structural alignments strongly suggest that the hydrophobic pocket in prcp, formed by trp  <dig>  trp  <dig>  met  <dig> and met  <dig> is functionally equivalent to the s <dig> binding sites of pep and dpp <dig> 

substrate specificity of the s <dig> protease family
prcp shares  <dig> % sequence identity with dpp <dig> . the crystal structure of dpp <dig> was recently deposited with the protein data bank by the structural genomics consortium , although the structure is not yet described in print. essentially all of the structural features observed for prcp, including the α/β hydrolase domain, the novel sks domain, the dimerization interface, the unusual arg-his-his interaction in the active site, and the pro s <dig> binding site are preserved between the two enzymes . the cα r.m.s.d. for the aligned structures is  <dig>  Å. the structural description presented here for prcp therefore defines the architecture of the s <dig> protease family fold.

a striking difference between prcp and dpp <dig> is a structural insertion present only in dpp <dig> spanning residues 329- <dig> . this short insertion sequence adopts a hairpin structure that is stabilized by a disulfide bridge between cys  <dig> and cys  <dig>  the peptide substrates of dpp <dig> and prcp must occupy the two enzymes in the same orientation based on the conserved architectures of the catalytic triad and the s <dig> pro binding site. the structural insertion of dpp <dig> truncates the active-site cleft of dpp <dig>  and explains the different substrate specificities of the two enzymes. the binding of known substrates by prcp that are cleaved at the c-terminus requires access to the long substrate binding groove of prcp. in contrast, the dpp7-specific structural insertion creates a blocked substrate binding site that can only accommodate short, dipeptidyl extensions at the n-terminus of potential substrates. this represents a remarkably simple evolutionary adaptation to impart the c- and n-terminal substrate specificities of prcp and dpp <dig> within a conserved active-site architecture.

the dpp7-specific insertion may also play an important role in substrate binding. for the aminopeptidase dpp <dig>  substrate recognition involves coordination of the n-terminal amine of the substrate by glu  <dig> of dpp <dig>   <cit> . the importance of this interaction in dpp <dig> is illustrated by the observations that the mutation of glu  <dig> in dpp <dig> abolishes enzymatic activity  <cit>  and that n-terminal acetylation of dpp <dig> substrates protects against dpp <dig> proteolysis  <cit> . the insertion loop of dpp <dig> also contains an acidic residue, asp  <dig>  which could function to coordinate with the n-terminus of the substrate in an analogous fashion to dpp <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
the structure of the human carboxypeptidase prcp presented here provides the first structural description of the s <dig> family of proteases. these proteases consist of a conserved α/β hydrolase domain and a novel structural domain that caps the active site. comparison with the previously undescribed structure of the aminopeptidase dpp <dig> reveals that a short insertion sequence in dpp <dig> sterically occludes access to the substrate binding groove to provide a simple evolutionary adaptation to change substrate specificity. these structural results provide the basis for rational design of selective prcp regulators for the modulation of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
