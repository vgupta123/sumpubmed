BACKGROUND
the pou5f <dig> gene belongs to the pou  family of transcription factors, that encodes the octamer-binding transcription factor- <dig>   <cit> . in mouse, before the zygotic gene activation the active pou5f <dig> mrna is present in the oocyte. the zygotic expression is activated around the 4-cell stage and later restricted to the pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass  and to the epiblast. following implantation, the expression is down-regulated and limited to the primordial germ cells  but silenced in all somatic cells  <cit> . in vitro embryo studies in bovine, pig, rhesus monkey and in human have shown that the protein is present in the trophoblast cells of blastocyst stage embryos and it is not restricted to the pluripotent icm cells  <cit> . in vitro, pou5f <dig> is highly expressed in human and mouse escs. these cells lose their pluripotency during differentiation, therefore the pou5f <dig> expression is diminished  <cit> .

the pou5f <dig> protein is among the core group of transcription factors that induces and controls stemness in escs. it sustains pluripotency through feed-forward and feedback transcriptional mechanism and it also plays a crucial role in the early mammalian development  <cit> .

the expression of pou5f <dig> is controlled by cis-regulatory elements, located 5' upstream from the initiation site of transcription  <cit> . the regulatory region of pou5f <dig> is highly conserved among species; and usually contains four conserved regions  within the promoter. the tata-less minimal promoter  region is always located within the first conserved region  of the upstream sequence of the gene. this minimal promoter contains further primary regulatory elements, such as sp1/sp <dig>  and hormone responsive element  binding sites. reporter gene expression experiments in mouse with lacz revealed that two elements, the proximal enhancer  and the distal enhancer  are essential in the cell-specific regulation of pou5f <dig>  the proximal enhancer  is located about  <dig>  kb upstream, within conserved regions  and is responsible for pou5f <dig> expression in embryonic ectoderm and mouse embryonal carcinoma  cells. finally, the distal enhancer  located about  <dig> kb upstream, also within a conserved region  and drives the pou5f <dig> expression in the morula, icm, esc, embryonic germ  and pgc cells of the mouse  <cit> .

rabbit  is a classical experimental animal model due to its physiological and immunological properties; it is preferentially used in pulmonary, cardiovascular and metabolic studies, as well as for antibody production and drug screening. in mouse, a wide range of genetic methods have been developed so far, and the successful application of the same technology in rabbits would be very desirable. recent publications about generating rabbit escs  <cit>  and successful somatic cell nuclear transfer  experiments  <cit>  raise the possibility for increasing the use of rabbit model systems for wider applications.

although the rabbit pou5f <dig> cdna and the genomic dna sequences were recently published  <cit> , the isolation and the detailed characterisation of its regulatory region is still missing. moreover, its expression during embryo preimplantation has not yet been well characterized  <cit> . this study for the first time describes isolation and sequencing of the rabbit orthologue of pou5f <dig> 5' regulatory region and the identification of its phylogenetically conserved regions. we also examined the function of the individual truncated promoter regions using gfp reporter gene system. in addition we also examined the expression pattern of rabbit pou5f <dig> in individual preimplantation stage embryos using quantitative real-time pcr.

RESULTS
isolation of the rabbit pou5f <dig> upstream region
recently, the mhc region of rabbit was mapped  <cit>  and partial pou5f1-like gene has been sequenced on bac clones lbab-841a <dig> and lbab- <dig>  based on multi-species sequence comparison , primers were designed for the conserved regions , and applied for pcr screens and further sequencing.

the initial atg is signed as + <dig>  the positions show the genomic locations of the primer. f: forward, r: reverse * pseudogene-specific primers, the positions show the pseudogene location of the primers

the sequenced  <dig>  kb pou5f1-like region was confirmed as the rabbit's entire pou5f <dig> gene by multiple sequence comparison. five highly conserved regions have been found, which perfectly matched with the well-characterized five exons of the reference sequences. the lengths of the sequences of these conserved, putative exonic regions were quite similar but not identical, indicating the existence of non-conserved intronic regions. the complete rabbit pou5f <dig> sequence is now referred to as ef <dig> and mapped to the mhc region, 12q <dig>   <cit> .

to confirm the coding sequence of pou5f <dig>  race pcr was applied on blastocyst samples. the gene-specific inner primers were bound to the conserved region of the gene; the outer primers were annealed to the 5'utr and the polya tail. the expressed and coding region was found to be  <dig> bp, which matched exactly with the previously predicted exons. the rabbit cdna sequence was identical to human, mouse and bovine in 84%, 83% and 87%, respectively. the cdna sequence is now referred as ef <dig> <cit> .

sequence analysis of the rabbit pou5f <dig> promoter region
following confirmation of the pou5f1-like sequence as a rabbit coding sequence, the  <dig>  kb fragment of the pou5f <dig> upstream region was sequenced and aligned to its orthologues . the alignment proved the presence of four extensively conserved regions  and three enhancer regions in the rabbit pou5f <dig> 5' upstream sequence. these cr regions are known to be the functional regions of the pou5f <dig> promoter in several species  <cit> . the different regions in rabbit showed extensive identity compared to the human, bovine, dog and to mouse sequences . in rabbit, the tata-less minimal promoter  that is located within the cr <dig> region, extends until - <dig> bp, and contains both the overlapping binding sites of sp1/sp <dig> , the hormone responsive element  and three g/c rich regions . the e-box sequence in rabbit , that plays a regulatory role in the control of transcription by binding basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factors, is located within the proximal enhancer region 1b . the proximal enhancer region 1b  is localized within the cr <dig> region , while the proximal enhancer region 1a  is located outside of the cr <dig> region . this pe-1a region exceptionally shows less similarity to all reference species. the cr <dig> region is localized upstream of pe-1a sequence. the distal enhancer region  is located within the cr <dig> region , last from - <dig> to - <dig> bp. transcription factor  binding site, oct4/sox <dig> is located  in the distal enhancer, within the cr <dig> region. we have identified several g/c-rich motifs present in all of the five mammalian sequences; however the one near the pe-1a enhancer we found a cccaccc motif present only in rabbit. this motif partially overlaps the ccctccc sequence. the schematic draw of organization of rabbit pou5f <dig> promoter region is shown in figure  <dig> 

pairwise comparison method was used to compare the pou5f <dig> regulatory regions of the rabbit and of the four mammalian species. the largest homologies of the regions are bolded; oc, oryctolagus cuniculus; mm, mus musculus; hs, homo sapiens; bt, bos taurus, and cf, canis familiaris;  no data.

functional analysis of the promoter regions
four different reporter constructs were electroporated into mouse escs to test the functionality of the predicted conserved region in the pou5f <dig> promoter . the minimal  promoter , the proximal promoter with proximal enhancers , the proximal promoter with distal enhancer  and the entire promoter region +cr4) were tested. the fluorescent activity of the minimal promoter  was very weak compared to the control ubiquitin promoter and to the basic auto-fluorescence of non-transfected control r <dig> escs . therefore, the rabbit pou5f <dig> regulatory region is capable to express in mouse esc as a minimal promoter. the addition of cr2+cr <dig> regions did not increase the level of expression substantially compared to the cr <dig> fragment. however, when the cr <dig> region was co-transfected with the minimal promoter , the level of expression was increased more than two fold. similarly, the expression was also two fold higher compared to that of the cr <dig> alone, when the full promoter region  was transfected or the region of cr1+ was co-transfected with the cr <dig>  however, the intensity of the expression was significantly less compared to the ubiquitin promoter  or to the control pmaxgfp vector expression . when its expression was compared to the mouse pou5f <dig> minimal promoter  and distal enhancer-containing promoter region construct   <cit> , the later exhibited a lower expression intensity in average .

pou5f <dig> expression in preimplantation stage embryos
the expression of rabbit pou5f <dig> gene was analyzed by quantitative real-time rt-pcr in preimplantation stage rabbit embryos, and compared with the mouse pou5f <dig> expression. in all examined stages the mrna of pou5f <dig> was detectable in the embryos with various intensities. the mrna was present in oocytes and zygotes at a higher level , but the levels continuously decreased until the embryonic genome activation, which occurs between late 8- to 16-cell stages during rabbit preimplantation development  <cit> ). following the embryonic genome activation, the expression levels increased continuously until the blastocyst stage . the pou5f <dig> transcript was also quantified in the isolated icm and trophoblast portions of the rabbit blastocysts and the relative levels were compared taking the blastocyst transcript as calibrator. the comparison revealed that the pou5f <dig> gene was clearly expressed in both cell types but at a significantly higher  level in the icm compared to the trophoblast cells .

identification of pseudogenes
bac library screen was performed with primers oct4- <dig> and oct4- <dig>  and bac clones lbab-304a <dig> and lbab-779h <dig> were identified. both clones contain a pou5f1-like sequence, and although they lack introns, they contain remnants of polya tail flanked by direct repeats, all of the characteristics of retrotransposed pseudogenes  <cit> . based on sequencing the flanking region, the two bac clones were found to be identical, containing the same genomic region. yet, the chromosomal localization of these bac clones is unknown.

the cdna of pou5f <dig> gene and its pseudogene share a 99% overall sequence identity . sequence analysis revealed that there is an eight nucleotide deletion in the pseudogene in position  <dig> bp from the initial atg that causes a frameshift in the sequence. this results the encoding of a 162amino acid-long truncated protein instead of the  <dig> amino acid-long functional protein. this truncated form lacks the functional pou domain, but still has a 92% similarity on amino acid level until the frameshift caused stop codon. the sequence of the pseudogene is referred as eu <dig> 

furthermore, to test whether the pseudogene was retrotransposed back near to a functioning promoter, we examined its expression using pseudogene-specific primers in rt-qpcr experiment. the analysis showed that the pseudogene is not expressing at any preimplantation developmental-stages in rabbit .

discussion
this is the first study describing the cloning and the analysis of the complete regulatory region of the rabbit pou5f <dig> gene. we have also cloned the rabbit pou5f <dig> cdna and analyzed the expression pattern in preimplantation-stage embryos. in addition, we identified a processed pseudogene, having a high degree of similarity.

our results demonstrate that both the gene structure and the sequence of pou5f <dig> are extremely conserved among various species . as in other species, pou5f <dig> was mapped to the mhc region, and contained  <dig> exons with a longer first intron and 3' utr. the putative protein sequence is almost identical with that of other species. this indicates the highly conserved role of pou5f <dig> in early vertebrate development.

in our study, the  <dig>  kb fragment of the rabbit pou5f <dig> upstream region was isolated and aligned to its orthologues . comparing the 5' region of human, bovine, mouse and dog pou5f <dig> sequences to the rabbit, all the functionally important regions could be unquestionably defined within  <dig> kb upstream of its transcription start site. in comparison to the mouse, the rabbit sequence lacks large intersections between cr <dig> and cr <dig> regions, but the functional regions in all the four species were almost identical. several conserved repetitive sequences, e-boxes, the binding site of pem, pax- <dig> and sp <dig> transcription factors  <cit>  were identified. furthermore, the hre binding site was also identified which was shown previously to be important in ra-induced pou5f <dig> down regulation. the newly identified cccccc motifs that we have identified only in rabbit might gain importance when studying the differences of pou5f <dig> gene regulation in mammalian species.

the cr <dig> region is of particular interest for pluripotent stem cell research  <cit> , because this region is responsible for the pou5f <dig> expression in escs  <cit> . previously, the extended comparative sequence analysis of other mammals  clearly showed three highly consensus sites inside the cr <dig> region  <cit> . in rabbit, all three sequences are identical; this suggests the functional significance and a highly conserved regulatory role in mammals. using comparative sequence analysis we observed that the rabbit and the human pou5f <dig> regulatory regions share the greatest homology among the investigated four species.

our functional assessment studies on mouse escs verified the sequence analysis results. in our experiments the rabbit cr <dig> region containing the promoter fragments showed the highest expression level in mouse escs. this suggests that the rabbit cr <dig> promoter region confer the same transcriptional regulation activity as the mouse cr <dig> sequence in mouse escs. also, the rabbit construct showed no significant difference in expression intensity compared to the mouse pou5f <dig> promoter .

the quantitative real-time rt-pcr showed that there is a high level of maternal origin pou5f <dig> mrna in oocytes and zygotes, which decreased gradually until  <dig> to 16-cell stage. the transiently reduced transcript levels increased continuously after the embryonic genome activation . these data are in agreement with the measured  and published gene expression patterns of mouse  <cit> . however, since the embryo genome activation in rabbit starts later than in mouse, a difference in the timing of endogenous pou5f <dig> expressions was detected between mouse and rabbit.

in mouse, the expression becomes confined to the icm following the morula stage, up-regulated in the primitive ectoderm, and eventually becomes confined to primordial germ cells  <cit> . in rabbit, we found that the pou5f <dig> was expressed in both the trophoblast and the icm at the mrna level. in bovine, porcine, rhesus monkey and human preimplantation stage embryos the pou5f <dig> protein was also localized in both cell types  <cit> . in bovine the presence of pou5f <dig> protein in trophoblast cells might act as a suppressor of extraembryonic lineage-specific gene expression during the preimplantation development which allows an extensive proliferation of the trophoblast before the implantation  <cit> . these results indicate that the restriction of expression in blastocyst stage is species-specific  <cit> .

finally, we have identified a processed, retrotransposed pseudogene of the rabbit pou5f <dig>  retrotransposed genes are generated from mrna and they integrate back to the genome after reverse transcription. due to this process, these kinds of pseudogenes usually lack a functioning promoter, or endure some modification, which make them unable to code the functional or full-length proteins. here we confirmed that the newly identified rabbit pou5f <dig> pseudogene was not expressed during rabbit preimplantation development. further studies will be needed to clarify its expression in further developmental stages and in differentiated tissues as some pseudogenes are known to possess certain regulatory roles  <cit> . bioinformatics analysis revealed that retrotransposition frequency of esc-specific genes appears far to exceed that of non-esc specific genes, and multiple highly homologous pseudogenes likely exist for all of the esc-specific genes  <cit> . this is a characteristic of human  <cit>  and also of mouse  <cit> . it is not clear yet whether this abundant presence of pluripotency pseudogenes in mouse and human would be also an indication of unknown functions. in human the pou5f1p <dig> pseudogene encodes a putative protein similar to pou5f <dig> isoform  <dig>  which is localized close to the amplified region of a variety of human malignancies  <cit> . recent reports on human pou5f <dig> pseudogenes suggested - especially in somatic cells, tissue-specific stem cells, and non-germ cell tumours - that some re-evaluation of expression data on pou5f <dig> might be needed due to the use of primers which cannot distinguish pseudogenes from the coding one  <cit> . in other species - including the mouse and rabbit - the functional relevance of pseudogenes of pou5f <dig> is still uncovered.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first comprehensive analysis of rabbit pou5f <dig> regulatory domains. detailed sequence analysis of the isolated rabbit pou5f <dig> promoter revealed high sequence conservation in the identified enhancer domains. the strong conservation of regulatory domain sequences shows the importance of the control of pou5f <dig> expression in early mammalian development. we have shown that the highest homology of enhancers can be identified between human and rabbit. this may increase the importance to use the rabbit as a comparative functional genomics tool for human medical research.
