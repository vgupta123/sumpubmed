BACKGROUND
parathyroid hormone  regulates serum calcium and phosphate levels and bone strength. serum calcium and phosphate concentrations, in turn, control pth gene expression post-transcriptionally through regulated binding of the trans-acting proteins au rich binding factor  <dig> , upstream of n-ras  and kh-type splicing regulatory protein  to a type iii au rich element  in pth mrna 3'-utr  <cit> . auf <dig> and unr stabilize pth mrna both in an in-vitro degradation assays , using parathyroid extracts, and in intact cells. we have recently shown that the mrna decay promoting protein ksrp decreases pth mrna stability and steady-state levels through the pth mrna are  <cit> . both ksrp and auf <dig> bind to pth mrna in vitro and in intact parathyroid glands  <cit> . in the parathyroid, the interaction of pth mrna with ksrp and auf <dig> is regulated by changes in serum calcium and phosphate. calcium depletion increases the association of auf <dig> with the pth mrna are and decreases ksrp binding to the are resulting in mrna stabilization. these interactions are reversed by phosphate depletion where pth mrna is destabilized  <cit> . in tranfected cells, over-expression of ksrp destabilizes the pth mrna and this is mediated by the pth mrna are. ksrp-pth mrna interaction is prevented by over-expression of auf <dig> p <dig> isoform. over-expression of auf <dig> p <dig> also attenuates the ksrp-mediated destabilization of pth mrna in transfected cells  <cit> . the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase pin <dig> is also a pth mrna destabilizing protein. pin <dig> mediates its effects via interaction with ksrp, which leads to ksrp dephosphorylation and activation  <cit> . the regulated interactions of ksrp and auf <dig> with the pth mrna are determine its half life in vivo and in vitro.

ares are destabilizing elements located in the 3'utrs of many inherently labile mrnas  <cit> . ares are targets for trans-acting proteins regulating mrna localization, stability and translation  <cit> . upon deadenylation, are-containing mrnas are degraded in either a 3' to 5' or a 5' to 3' direction by two distinct exoribonucleolytic pathways mediated by the exosome and xrni, respectively  <cit> . it has been recently demonstrated that these two pathways are functionally linked  <cit> . ksrp recruits the multiprotein 3'-5'exoribonuclease complex, exosome to target mrnas. the central part of ksrp contains four adjacent kh domains that are required for its interaction with the decay-promoting machinery and with are containing mrnas  <cit> . au rich binding factor  <dig>  promotes either decay or stabilization, depending on the mrna and cell type  <cit> .

in addition, a number of mrnas are targeted by endonucleases that initiate decay by cleaving within the body of the mrna while it is actively engaged by translating ribosomes. three mrna endonucleases have been linked to specific decay pathways; polysomal ribonuclease  <dig>   <cit> , g3bp  <cit>  and ire- <dig>  <cit> . in xenopus laevis hepatocytes, many mrnas are destabilized by estrogen through the activation of pmr <dig>  <cit> . pmr <dig> forms a selective complex with its substrate mrna to initiate decay by cleaving within the mrna  <cit> . xenopus  pmr <dig> is a member of the peroxidase gene family and is synthesized as a 80-kda precursor  that is processed to the active 60-kda form   <cit> . the ability of pmr <dig> to target polysomes and activate mrna decay depends on tyrosine phosphorylation at position  <dig> in the c-terminus of pmr <dig> by c-src  <cit> .

here we show that pth mrna is a substrate for pmr <dig> in vitro and in transfected cells. the pth mrna 3'-utr are is required for pmr60-dependent pth mrna destabilization. pmr <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with pth mrna, the exosome and ksrp. surprisingly, sirna mediated knock-down of either exosome components or ksrp reduces the pmr1-mediated pth mrna decay in intact cells. we suggest that ksrp recruits a degradation complex, comprising both endo- and exo-ribonucleases to pth mrna, thus controlling its mrna half-life.

RESULTS
pmr <dig> decreases pth mrna and protein levels in transfected hek <dig> cells by promoting are-dependent pth mrna decay
using an antibody to xenopus pmr <dig> we identified the mammalian pmr <dig> ortholog in rat parathyroid, rat liver, and human hek <dig> cells . there is no parathyroid cell line and we therefore studied the effect of the catalytically-active form of tap and myc-tagged pmr <dig>  pmr <dig>  <cit>  on pth mrna levels in transfected cells. hek <dig> cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids expressing the endoribonuclease together with either rat  or human  pth mrna driven by a cmv promoter. pmr <dig> reduced rat  and human  pth mrna levels . pmr <dig> over-expression had no affect on the mrna levels of transfected human growth hormone  , luciferase , or endogenous l <dig> ribosomal protein mrna . the decrease in pth mrna levels was matched by a parallel decrease in the amount of rpth and hpth produced and secreted into the growth medium of the cells expressing pmr <dig> .

pth gene expression is largely controlled by an are in the 3'- utr of pth mrna  <cit> . to determine if the regulation of pth mrna levels by pmr <dig> is exerted via the pth mrna are, we used a rpth expression plasmid with an internal deletion of the pth mrna 3'-utr are. in contrast to the full-length pth mrna, co-tranfected pmr <dig> had no effect on the mutated pth mrna . therefore, the decrease in pth mrna levels by pmr <dig> is dependent on an intact are. we then used a gh reporter gene containing the rat pth  <dig> nt are   <cit> . transfected pmr <dig> reduced gh <dig> mrna levels but had no effect on wild type gh or endogenous Î²-actin mrna levels . these results demonstrate that pmr <dig> specifically reduces steady-state pth mrna levels through the pth mrna are which is both necessary and sufficient for this effect.

we then studied the effect of pmr <dig> on pth mrna decay by ivda using uniformly radio-labeled polyadenylated full-length rat pth mrna, pth mrna lacking the are or gh mrna. the transcripts were incubated with extracts from cells transfected with control plasmid, pmr <dig> or a catalytically inactive form of pmr <dig>   <cit> . there were equal amounts of transfected pmr <dig> or pmr <dig> in the extracts . pmr <dig> over-expression accelerated pth mrna decay compared to control transfected cells or cells transfected with the catalytically-inactive form pmr <dig> . the t1/ <dig> of the pth mrna transcript decreased from > <dig> min in the control cell extracts to ~ <dig> min. in the pmr <dig> expressing cell extracts . over-expression of pmr <dig> had no effect on the decay of a control gh mrna  or on pth mrna lacking the are . our results indicate that pmr <dig> over-expression specifically reduces pth mrna steady-state levels and stability acting through the pth mrna are.

pmr <dig> associates with pth mrna in transfected cells and cleaves pth mrna in vitro
pmr <dig> forms a selective complex with its target mrna and the substrate mrna can be recovered with tap-tagged catalytically-inactive pmr <dig>  <cit> . hek <dig> cells were co-transfected with either tap and myc-tagged pmr <dig> or empty vector together with expression plasmids for either hpth or luciferase. immunoblot analysis using anti-myc antibody identified pmr <dig> in the input and bound fractions . rt-pcr of rna of the input and bound fractions showed that pth mrna was recovered by pmr <dig> and not by the negative control . the specificity of this interaction was confirmed by the absence of luciferase mrna in the pmr600-recovered fraction . therefore, pmr <dig> specifically interacts with pth mrna in hek <dig> cells.

we then studied whether pth mrna is a substrate for partially purified pmr <dig> in vitro. we used the catalytically active form of tap and myc-tagged pmr <dig>   <cit> , recovered by igg-sepharose affinity purification from transfected cultured cells. pmr <dig> cleaved in vitro transcribed uniformly labeled pth mrna but not gh mrna .

pmr <dig> also cleaved a 3'-end labeled rat pth mrna and generated a single 3'-end labeled cleavage product of approximately  <dig> nt, that was detected by urea-page . a control gh transcript was not cleaved , as with uniformly labeled gh mrna . our results suggest that pth mrna is a target for pmr <dig> in vitro and that this endoribonuclease cleaves pth rna at a site located approximately  <dig> nt from its 3' end.

pmr <dig> associates with the exosome component rrp <dig> and with ksrp
we have recently shown that ksrp interacts with the pth mrna are and decreases pth mrna stability and levels  <cit> . ksrp interacts with the exosome that is required for pth mrna rapid decay in the presence of parathyroid extracts  <cit> . we hypothesized that pmr <dig> may cooperate with ksrp and the exosome to facilitate pth mrna decay. we first studied the association of pmr <dig> with ksrp. hek <dig> cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for either tap- and myc-tagged pmr <dig> or gfp-tap. gfp and pmr <dig> containing complexes were affinity purified, digested by tev protease, and analyzed by immunoblot . anti-ksrp immunoblot demonstrated that endogenous ksrp co-purifies with pmr <dig> . ksrp contains four adjacent kh domains  <cit> . kh domains 3- <dig> are sufficient for recruitment of the exosome complex and for ksrp association with are containing mrnas including pth mrna  <cit> . we show that pmr <dig> also associated with transfected flag-tagged wild type ksrp , ksrp1- <dig> containing all four kh domains without flanking sequences , and with the deletion mutant flag-ksrp3- <dig>  containing kh domains 3- <dig>  these interactions were rnase insensitive . these data demonstrate that pmr <dig> associates with ksrp and that kh domains 3- <dig> are sufficient for this interaction.

we next studied the association of pmr <dig> with the exosome in cos <dig> cells. pmr <dig> over-expression has a similar effect to decrease co-transfected pth mrna levels in these cells . cos- <dig> cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing tap and myc-tagged pmr <dig> and either flag-gfp or flag-rrp <dig>  one of the core exosome subunits. cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated by anti-flag antibody. anti-myc immunoblotting of the immuno-complexes revealed that pmr <dig> was specifically recovered by rrp <dig> but not by gfp . altogether, our findings indicate that pmr <dig> associates with both ksrp and the exosome.

ksrp, pmr <dig>  and the exosome are components of the pth mrna decay machinery
to further study the mechanism of pth mrna decay by pmr <dig> and the exosome, pmr <dig> over expression was performed together with sirna-mediated knock-down of exosome components. a ~70% rrp <dig> knock-down compared to control  sirna , led to a marked increase in the mrna levels of co-transfected pth , thus confirming our previous data that the exosome is required for pth mrna decay  <cit> . as expected, pmr <dig> reduced pth mrna levels when co-transfected with the control sirnas . simultaneous over-expression of pmr <dig> and knock-down of rrp <dig> lead to pth mrna levels of control transfected cells . neither sirnas affected mrna levels of the endogenous control gapdh mrna . similar results were obtained by knocking-down the exosome subunit rrp <dig> . these results indicate that exosome components participate in the pmr60-induced decrease in pth mrna in intact cells.

we also studied the ability of pmr <dig> to reduce pth mrna levels in ksrp depleted cells. ksrp was knocked down by specific sirnas in cells expressing pth and either pmr <dig> or control plasmid. ksrp knock-down  increased pth mrna levels  as we have previously reported  <cit> . interestingly, ksrp knock-down partially prevented the pmr60-induced decrease in pth mrna levels . similar results were obtained using an additional set of sirnas targeting a different sequence of ksrp mrna . altogether our results indicate that the exosome and ksrp participate in the pmr60-dependent decrease in pth mrna levels in cultured cells.

discussion
pth mrna contains a  <dig> nt-long are-like region in its 3'-utr that determines pth mrna stability  <cit> . this element leads to decreased mrna levels of reporter genes in transfected cells  <cit> . the regulated binding of the pth mrna stabilizing proteins, auf <dig> and unr, and the destabilizing factor ksrp to this  <dig> element controls pth mrna levels in vivo in the parathyroid gland and in vitro in transfected cells  <cit> . ksrp promotes rapid mrna decay by recruiting the exoribonucleolytic complex exosome to its target mrnas  <cit> . we now show that the endoribonuclease pmr <dig> decreases pth mrna levels in transfected cells and that this involves the pth mrna are, ksrp and the exosome.

few vertebrate mrna endonucleases have been identified, one of which is pmr <dig>  since a pmr <dig> immunoreactive protein similar to the mammalian ortholog  <cit>  is expressed in the parathyroid, we asked whether this endoribonuclease may be part of the pth mrna decay machinery. reagents for mammalian pmr <dig> are not available so we used the closely-related xenopus protein  <cit> . over-expression of the catalytically active form of pmr <dig>  decreased pth mrna levels in co-transfected cells and this was dependent upon the pth mrna  <dig> nt are. similarly, in ivda experiments, extracts from pmr <dig> over-expressing cells led to a more rapid decay of pth mrna with an intact are, when compared to extracts from mock-transfected cells. these results identify pth mrna and in particular the pth mrna are as a target for pmr <dig> in transfected cells. a pmr <dig> enriched fraction also specifically cleaved pth mrna in vitro. at least one cleavage site was identified ~ <dig> nt from the pth mrna 3' end. it has been reported that pmr <dig> preferentially cleaves single-stranded rnas at ug dinucleotides within albumin mrna  <cit> . the pth mrna 3'-utr is an open region with little folded base pairing  <cit>  and contains several ug dinucleotides that may be potential targets for pmr <dig>  specifically, the 3' terminal region of rat pth mrna contains a single ug dinucleotide compatible with the production of a ~ <dig> nt 3' pth mrna fragment upon digestion. interestingly, this ug dinucleotide is part of the pth mrna 3'-utr  <dig> nt are instability element that is both necessary and sufficient to confer regulation of pth mrna stability by changes in calcium and phosphate levels by rat parathyroid extracts and in vitro in transfected cells  <cit> .

we also show that pmr <dig> specifically interacts with pth mrna. furthermore, pmr <dig> displays an unanticipated association with the exosome component rrp <dig> and with ksrp. both interactions occur in the absence of pth mrna. it is of interest that ksrp kh domains 3- <dig> that mediate ksrp-exosome association and promote are-containing mrna decay  <cit> , are sufficient for ksrp-pmr <dig> association. kh domains  <dig> and  <dig> also mediate the binding of ksrp to the pth mrna are  <cit> . we can hypothesize that ksrp recruits pmr <dig> to additional labile mrnas and this protein-protein association would facilitate ksrp-dependent decay promoting activity.

our results show that the effect of the endoribonuclease pmr <dig> on pth mrna levels is dependent upon the expression of exosome components and ksrp, which interacts with both the exosome and pmr <dig>  these results suggest that pmr <dig>  ksrp and the exosome participate in pth mrna decay by forming a multi-subunit degradation complex with the pth mrna are . upon pmr <dig> cleavage, pth mrna decay may proceed through exosome mediated removal of the 5' fragment or of both fragments by exonucleolytic cleavage. of interest, pmr <dig> over-expression prevented the increased pth mrna levels induced by either exosome or ksrp depletion, suggesting that pmr <dig> may also have an effect on pth mrna expression that is independent of both ksrp and the exosome.

cooperation between ribonucleolytic machineries have been reported also in other systems. knock-down of the de-capping protein dcp <dig> reduces decay from the 3' end of a Î²-globin mrna carrying the c-fos are, and knockdown of the exosome subunits pm/scl- <dig> or rrp <dig> reduce decay from the 5' end, indicating that the 5' and 3' decay pathways are functionally linked and that unstable mrnas can be degraded simultaneously from both ends  <cit> . wang and kiledjian have similarly shown that mrna decay proceeds through a coupled 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' exoribonucleolytic pathway that involves the interaction of a sub-set of the exosome proteins with dcps and the decapping pathway  <cit> . moreover, it was recently shown that eukaryotic exosome itself contains both exonuclease and endonuclease activity, mediated by two distinct domains of its dis <dig>  subunit.  <cit> . our studies do not exclude the possibility of an endonuclease activity of the exosome that co-purifies with pmr <dig> and is distinct from pmr <dig> and cleaves pth mrna. the combination of endo and exoribonucleases in one rna-degrading machine may offer a fundamental advantage to the cell and appears to be more widespread in nature than could be expected  <cit> . altogether, the above observations and the data presented here demonstrate that interactions of the exosome complex with other mrna decay enzymes facilitate and coordinate mrna decay, both endo- and exonucleolytically.

CONCLUSIONS
pth mrna is a target for the endonuclease pmr <dig>  the pmr <dig> mediated decrease in pth mrna levels involves the pth mrna 3'-utr are, ksrp and the exosome. our findings suggest an unanticipated mechanism by which ksrp and the exosome regulate the half-life of a target mrna by facilitating its endoribonucleolytic cleavage.
