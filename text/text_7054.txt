BACKGROUND
currently, there is no effective therapy for non-small cell lung cancer , thus nsclc remains lethal  <cit> . the 5-year survival rate is at best still below 50%. in addition, nsclc consists of several subtypes that require distinct therapies. thus, from both a diagnosis and therapy point of view, the identification of genes critical to nsclc is urgent. few studies have identified nsclc critical genes. fawdar et al  <cit>  recently found that mutations in fgfr <dig>  mao3k and pak <dig> have critical roles in lung cancer progression. li et al  <cit>  also recently identified eml4-alk fusion gene and egfr and kras gene mutations were associated with nsclc. takeuchi et al  <cit>  also reported that ret, ros <dig> and alk gene fusions were observed in lung cancer. however, it is likely that other critical gene candidates for nsclc exist.

in this study, we attempted to identify new critical candidate genes important for nsclc using recently proposed principal component  based unsupervised feature extraction  mediated integrated analysis  <cit>  of publically available promoter methylation and gene expression patterns of two nsclc cell lines with and without enhanced metastasis ability.

in contrast to the standard usage of pca, pca based unsupervised fe does not embed samples but features  into a low dimensional space. then, features identified as outliers are extracted . empirically this methodology was successful and identified biologically significant features  <cit>  even when other conventional methods tested in the current study failed.

most of the genes identified in the present study by this methodology were also previously reported as significant cancer-related genes. to understand the functionality of the selected genes, we predicted the tertiary structures of selected genes by full automatic modeling system   <cit>  and phyre <dig>  <cit>  profile-based protein structure prediction software. this system also allowed the identification of drug target candidate genes.

RESULTS
the first principal components show no significant difference between samples
since conventional methodology was not useful for the identification of differences between samples, we decided to employ pca based unsupervised fe to extract biologically relevant genes  when cell lines with and without metastasis were compared. since it was not our main purpose to emphasize novelty and superiority of the present method compared with the conventional methods, but to identify critical genes for nsclc metastasis, how the conventional methods failed to identify critical genes in nsclc metastasis will be discussed in discussion sections below . figure  <dig> shows two-dimensional embeddings of probes using pca for gene expression and promoter methylation. to apply pca based unsupervised fe, first we identified pcs to be used for fe. to determine what each principal component  represented, the contributions of samples to the first pc  are shown . as previously observed  <cit> , the first pc did not identify distinct features among the samples, although they had major contributions . contributions of samples to pc <dig> are almost constantly independent of samples for gene expression and promoter methylation. thus, we concluded that pc <dig> did not exhibit any significant differences among samples. it should be noted that this does not always mean that pc1s are biologically meaningless, but rather that most gene expression and promoter methylation is sample independent; thus, the cell lines are very similar to each other independent of their ability for metastasis. this is not surprising, as they are similar nsclc cell lines; therefore, significantly different outcomes caused by sample dependence and/or metastasis presence would be unusual.

the second pcs demonstrates distinction between cell lines
because the first pcs did not distinguish between samples, we next considered second pcs . as can be seen by two-dimensional embeddings of probes , the second pcs had a relatively smaller contribution. however, this does not always mean that pc2s are biologically meaningless, since pc <dig> having common values for all samples simply means that all samples behave similarly which does not always contradict with biological significance if all samples are equally biologically significant in the very similar fashions. the second pc of gene expression has only a  <dig> % contribution, while for promoter methylation it is  <dig> %. these values for contributions, especially for gene expression, can usually be ignored. however, in this case, since the samples were similar nsclc cell lines, differences between samples were expected to be small. thus, pcs with small contributions may represent biologically critical differences between samples, as shown in figure  <dig>  where the contributions of samples to pc2s are demonstrated. pc2s did not distinguish between samples with and without metastasis ability, but did distinguish between a <dig> and htb <dig> cell lines. because we are interested in metastasis-causing genes in hsclc, what pc <dig> expresses is out of the scope of the present study. however, it is useful to identify genes associated with pc <dig> to determine which genes are different between the two cell lines, a <dig> and htb <dig>  pc2s showed good correlation between gene expression and promoter methylation . thus, integrated analysis using pca based unsupervised fe is applicable. selected genes are shown in table  <dig>  figure s <dig>  shows the gene expression and promoter methylation of selected genes. if analysis is successful, genes selected based on mrna expression and those based on promoter methylation should overlap significantly. indeed, p-values attributed to selected genes common between gene expression and promoter methylation were  <dig> ×10- <dig> and  <dig> ×10- <dig>  respectively. thus, integrated analysis using pca based unsupervised fe was successful. in contrast to expectations, the selected genes were frequently and significantly related to cancers by the gendoo server  <cit>  , which was used because it attributed p-values to each association between genes and disease. thus, the reliability of associations can be more easily identified. the successful identification of associations between genes and disease by the gendoo server suggests that htb <dig> and a <dig> cell lines are potentially distinct to each other and should be considered separately. this is coincident with findings that when distinct genes are present between samples with and without metastasis, they can also reflect differences between the htb <dig> and a <dig> cell lines. conversely, in contrast to the high correlation of pc <dig> for gene expression and promoter methylation, correlations between gene expression and promoter methylation of individual genes were not significant . this might be because of the too small contribution of pc2s.

the third pcs distinguish differences between samples with and without metastasis for htb <dig> but not for a549
because no pcs reflected differences between samples with and without metastasis, we considered additional pcs. figure  <dig> shows the contributions of samples to the third pc . although pc3s have even smaller contributions  than pc1s or pc2s  their correlation is high. thus, genes associated with pc <dig> represent differences between samples with and without metastasis and we finally identified a useful pc. interestingly, pc <dig> exhibited differences between samples with and without metastasis only for the htb <dig> cell line. however, since the two cell lines are distinct in terms of their oncogenic potential, it is not surprising that genes that exhibit differences between samples with and without metastasis for htb <dig> did not exhibit differences between samples with and without metastasis for a <dig>  thus, we further applied integrated analysis using pca based unsupervised fe. selected genes are shown in table  <dig>  figure s <dig>  shows gene expression and promoter methylation of the selected genes. again, whether genes selected based on mrna expression and those based on promoter methylation were significantly overlapped was analyzed and p-values attributed to selected genes common between gene expression and promoter methylation were  <dig> ×10- <dig> and  <dig> ×10- <dig>  thus, integrated analysis using pca based unsupervised fe successfully identified genes with both aberrant mrna expression and promoter methylation. the association of cancer disease and the selected genes were investigated by the gendoo server, and the results are shown in table  <dig>  as expected, most of the selected genes were significantly associated with cancer disease. correlations between gene expression and promoter methylation of individual genes were not significant .

the fourth pc of promoter methylation and the fifth pc of gene expression represent differences between samples with and without metastasis for a <dig> but not for htb56
we further sought pcs that exhibited differences between samples with and without metastasis for a <dig>  the fourth pc  of promoter methylation and the fifth pc  of gene expression demonstrated differences between samples with and without metastasis for the a <dig> cell line . because the correlation between pc <dig> and pc <dig> were very high despite their small contributions , integrated analysis using pca based unsupervised fe could still be used. selected genes are shown in table  <dig>  figure s <dig>  shows gene expression and promoter methylation of the individual genes.

p-values attributed to selected genes common between gene expression and promoter methylation were  <dig> ×10- <dig>  thus, integrated analysis using pca based unsupervised fe was successful. cancer diseases associated with the selected genes are listed in table  <dig>  and more than 50% were reported to be associated with cancer-related diseases. however, correlations between gene expression and promoter methylation of individual genes were not significant .

discussion
although the association of cancer-related disease and the selected genes were annotated by the gendoo server, more detailed information, regarding whether genes are expressed or repressed in cancers, will be useful. in addition, since the gendoo server was last updated in april  <dig>  recent information might be missing. to fill these gaps, we will discuss the selected genes individually citing actual studies.

hoxb2
hoxb <dig> has a homeobox domain in the central region. figure s <dig>  shows the tertiary structure of the homeobox domain in hoxb <dig> predicted by fams. the homeodomain fold is a protein structural domain that binds to dna or rna and is commonly found in transcription factors. hoxb <dig> was upregulated in pancreatic cancer  <cit>  as a part of the retinoic acid  signaling pathway, which is generally regarded to be a potential anti-tumor agent  <cit> . hoxb <dig> also promotes the invasion of lung cancer cells by regulating metastasis-related genes  <cit> . considering these studies, it was not surprising that hoxb <dig> might also have a critical role in nsclc.

ccdc8
neither fams nor phyre <dig> predicted a significant tertiary structure for ccdc <dig>  which is reported to be a cofactor required for p53-mediated apoptosis through interactions with obsl <dig>  <cit> . thus, because p <dig> protein is a typical tumor suppressor, it is likely that ccdc <dig> has a critical role in nsclc.

znf114
znf <dig> has one krab box and four zinc-finger double domains. figure s <dig>  shows the zinc-finger domains as predicted by fams. since the zinc-finger double domain functions in dna binding, znf <dig> might also be a dna binding protein. krab is a transcription repression domain, thus znf <dig> might be a transcription suppressor. unfortunately, very few studies of znf <dig> have been published. however, mutation of ctcf that has seven zinc-finger double domains was reported to be associated with tumors  <cit> . gc <dig> that has multiple zinc-finger double domains was reported to be associated with apoptosis of prostate cancer cells  <cit> . studies related to proteins with zinc-finger double domains indicate znf <dig> might also have a role in nsclc.

dio2
figure s <dig>  shows the tertiary structure of dio <dig> as predicted by fams. dio <dig> belongs to the iodothyronine deiodinase family and is underexpressed in benign and malignant thyroid tumors  <cit> . dio <dig> expression was also shown to be higher in most brain tumors  <cit> . thus, although it is unclear whether dio <dig> is generally oncogenic or tumor suppressive, it appears to be related to cancer. therefore, dio <dig> is likely to be related to nsclc.

laptm5
neither fams nor phyre <dig> predicted a significant tertiary structure for laptm <dig>  a transmembrane protein that was reported to be associated with spontaneous regression of neuroblastomas  <cit> . inactivation of the e3/laptm <dig> gene by chromosomal rearrangement and dna methylation in human multiple myeloma was observed  <cit> . expression of laptm <dig> was also elevated in human b lymphomas  <cit> . although there have been no reports indicating a relationship between laptm <dig> and nsclc, laptm <dig> might have a critical role in nsclc.

rgs1
rgs <dig> contains a regulator of g protein signaling domain. the tertiary structure of rgs <dig> is available in the protein data bank  . regulator of g-protein signaling  proteins are related to cancer biology  <cit>  and genetic variations in these genes are associated with survival in late-stage nsclc  <cit> . rgs <dig> was overexpressed in a gene expression-profiling study of melanoma  <cit> . rgs is thought to be related to the functionality of g protein-coupled receptors  <cit>  that are often drug targets. thus, rgs might be a promising drug target candidate for therapy of nsclc.

b3galnt1
b3galnt <dig> is a galactosyl transferase that catalyzes the transfer of galactose. fig. s <dig>  shows the tertiary structure of b3galnt <dig> as predicted by fams. numerous studies have suggested a relationship between galactosyl transferase and cancer, including the use of galactosyl transferase as a tumor biomarker for ovarian clear cell carcinoma  <cit> . alternatively, cancer-associated isoenzymes of serum galactosyl transferase were reported in various cancers  <cit> . thus, b3galnt <dig> might have a role in nsclc progression, although no reports have demonstrated a specific relationship between b3galnt <dig> and cancer.

tinagl1
tinagl <dig> is papain family cysteine protease that degrades proteins. figure s <dig>  shows the tertiary structure as predicted by fams. tinagl <dig> is a sec23a-dependent metastasis suppressor  <cit>  and was reported to be upregulated in highly metastatic tumors  <cit> . thus, it was reasonable that it was selected as a cancer-related gene candidate by our methodology.

pmepa1
neither fams nor phyre <dig> predicted a significant tertiary structure for pmepa <dig>  a transmembrane prostate androgen-induced protein that enhances tumorigenic activity in lung cancer cells  <cit> . it was also reported to be upregulated in ovarian cancer  <cit> , colon cancer  <cit>  and renal cell carcinoma  <cit> . considering these studies, pmepa <dig> was reasonably selected as a nsclc-related gene by pca based unsupervised feature extraction  mediated integrated analysis.

cx3cl1
cx3cl <dig> contains a small cytokine  interleukin- <dig> -like domain. figure s <dig>  shows the tertiary structure of the il- <dig> domain as predicted by fams. the il- <dig> pathway was reported to be important in cancer  <cit>  and cx3cl <dig> expression was associated with a poor outcome in breast cancer patients  <cit>  as it promotes breast cancer via transactivation of the epidermal growth factor pathway  <cit> . a complex role for cx3cl <dig> in cancer has been reported  <cit> . thus, it was reasonable that cx3cl <dig> was selected by our methodology.

icam1
intercellular adhesion molecule  contains an n-terminal domain and three immunoglobulin domains. the tertiary structure of icam <dig> was available in pdb . many studies have reported a relationship between icam <dig> and cancer. icam <dig> expression was reported to determine the malignant potential of cancer  <cit> , to have a role in the invasion of human breast cancer cells  <cit> , and upregulated endogenous icam- <dig> reduced ovarian cancer cell growth in the absence of immune cells  <cit> . thus, it is reasonable that icam <dig> was selected as a potential nsclc therapy target by our methodology.

tinagl <dig> as a drug target gene candidate
in this study, we selected multiple genes that might be involved in the progression of nsclc metastasis. most of selected genes are potential cancer-related genes. thus, it is reasonable to regard these genes as therapy targets. among those selected, we investigated tinagl <dig> as a potential drug target gene, because although tinagl <dig> is regarded to be a tumor suppressor, in this study it was upregulated in a metastasis-enhanced cell line. naba et al  <cit>  also reported that tinagl <dig> was up-regulated in highly metastatic tumors. thus, inhibition of tinagl <dig> might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of metastatic ncslc. furthermore, although we used a profile based drug discovery software, chooseld   <cit> , for in silico drug screening, it required the tertiary structure of the target protein and multiple ligand compounds whose binding structure to the protein were known. tinagl <dig> satisfied these requirements as follows. to infer the tertiary structure of tinagl <dig>  we uploaded the amino acid sequence np_ <dig>  retrieved from refseq to fams and phyre <dig>  because there was no significant difference between tertiary structures inferred by fams and phyre <dig>  hereafter we used the structure inferred by fams.

based on fams, tinagl <dig> has many tertiary structures registered in pdb that can be used for tertiary structure predictions. among them, the "a" chain of pdb id: 2dcc  has a 32% sequence similarity with tinagl <dig> and is accompanied by multiple highly similar  tertiary structures registered in pdb . because all of these structures have more than one ligand that binds to protein, we had a large number of ligand-protein binding structures that could be used for in silico drug screening using chooseld. we selected 2dcc_a, a protein structure of tinagl <dig> from aa  <dig> to  <dig> for modeling by fams. because 2dcc_a is cathepsin, hereafter we called this structure the cathepsin domain. to confirm that chooseld could predict ligand binding to the cathepsin domain, we attempted to identify a known ligand that binds to the cathepsin domain. chembl  <cit>  was identified by a blast search using the cathepsin domain amino acid sequence. thus, plasmodium falciparum 3d <dig> , a putative protease, was found to have  <dig> % sequence similarity with the cathepsin domain. there were five assay experiments for this protein. among them, chembl <dig> was employed to list candidate binding ligands. three ligands were reported to inhibit plasmodium falciparum 3d <dig>  among them, chembl <dig> and chembl <dig>  were employed as potential binding ligands to tinagl <dig>  then chooseld was used to test the two ligands using  <dig> template ligand proteins 3s3q_c1p, 3s3r_0iw_ <dig>  3ai8_hnq_ <dig>  1gmy_hld_ <dig>  2dcc_77b, 1ito_e6c, 1qdq_ <dig>  2dc6_73v, 2dc7_ <dig>  2dc8_59a, 2dc9_74m, 2dca_75v, 2dcb_76v, 2dcd_78a, and 3pdf_lxv. fig. s <dig>  shows the binding of chembl <dig> and chembl <dig> to tinagl <dig> .

binding affinity of ligands to tinagl <dig> was evaluated by cyscore  <cit>  . all template ligands had negative, thus better, cyscores. although chembl <dig> or chembl <dig> did not achieve a negative cyscore, chembl <dig> had a low positive cyscore that was lower than the lowest template ligands. if we consider these two were only reported to bind to proteins with a tinagl <dig> sequence similarity of 45%, the cyscore attributed to chembl <dig> or chembl <dig> was good and demonstrated the ability of chooseld to infer proper binding configurations of potential ligands. since chooseld inferred suitable binding modes for two potential ligands, we concluded that in silico drug discovery is possible for tinagl <dig>  which might be a promising candidate drug target.

b3galnt <dig> as a candidate drug target gene
another potential drug target gene is b3galnt <dig>  substrates such as udp-galactose and udp-n-acetylglucosamine bind to b3galnt <dig> and after various catalytic reactions, udp remains bound to b3galnt <dig>  thus, if compounds that inhibit udp binding to b3galnt <dig> that compete with udp can be identified, the function of b3galnt <dig> can be inhibited. b3galnt <dig> is a galactosyl transferase, which is often reported to be upregulated in various cancers. thus, inhibition of b3calnt <dig> might be a potential therapeutic target for nsclc. fig. s <dig>  shows the udp and udp-n-acetylglucosamine binding to b3galnt <dig> predicted by chooseld. because both bind to the same pockets of b3galnt <dig>  chooseld can be used to identify other compounds that bind to and inhibit b3galnt <dig> 

inconsistency between gene expression and promoter methylation of individual genes
although figs. s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> show the gene expression and promoter methylation of individual genes associated with selected pcs, coincidence between gene expression and promoter methylation is relatively poor. gene selection was reliable because p-values attributed to the simultaneous selection of genes for gene expression and promoter methylation pcs were significant and the selected genes were associated with cancer-related genes . to resolve the discrepancy between the significant selection of genes and poor coincidence of individual genes between gene expression and promoter methylation, we considered promoter methylation by sequencing technology, which was performed simultaneously with microarray measurements. figure s <dig>  shows the promoter methylation profile of selected genes by sequencing technology. although measurements were unfortunately not available for all observations, promoter methylation measured by sequencing technology was more coincident  with gene expression than by microarray. since sequencing technology is more reliable than microarray, poor consistency between gene expression and promoter methylation might be explained by the poor ability of microarray to measure promoter methylation. thus, discrepancies are expected to be resolved when promoter methylation is measured with high accuracy.

superiority and novelty of the proposed method
the novel method employed in the current study has a number of advantages compared with existing conventional methodologies. to demonstrate failure of the conventional approaches, first we tried detect genes that have a negative correlation between mrna expression and promoter methylation. pairs of mrna expression microarray probes and promoter methylation probes to which common mrna refseq ids are attributed were collected. then pearson correlation coefficients were computed for all pairs as in figure  <dig>  the obtained p-values were adjusted by benjamin-hochberg criterion since there were more than twenty thousand pairs. only one gene had an adjusted p-value < <dig> . this clearly demonstrates the usefulness of applying pca, without which almost no significant correlations would be detected.

next, we used the t-test to detect significant differences between samples with and without metastasis. the t-test was applied to all probes and obtained p-values were again adjusted by benjamin-hochberg criterion to suppress failed positives because of high numbers of observations. for comparison between a <dig> cell lines with and without metastasis, no probes had adjusted p-values < <dig>  for either mrna expression or promoter methylation. for comparison between htb <dig> cell lines with and without metastasis, although as many as  <dig> probes had adjusted p-values < <dig>  for mrna expression, there were no probes for promoter methylation. this also suggests the usefulness of applying pca without which no significant aberrant promoter methylation or mrna expression would be detected.

these difficulties for the detections of significant correlations and aberrant mrna expression/promoter methylation were caused by the small number of replicates in the study . since pca can detect the behavior of a group of probes, this difficulty can be compensated for and explains why only applying pca can detect significant outcomes.

finally, we would like to emphasize some of the novelties of the pca based methodology. although pca itself is a frequently used method, the current study applied pca differently from conventional methodology. first, pca is usually used to embed samples into low dimensional space to demonstrate the groupings of samples, while this study used embedded probes. this enabled the identification of what each pc discriminates as in figure  <dig>  to our knowledge, pca has rarely been used this way. second, we did not ignore pcs to which only tiny contributions were attributed , while standard procedures recommend ignoring such pcs since it is impossible to distinguish them from background noise. the reason why such small a contribution can have meaning is because of the huge number of probes used. since as many as twenty to thirty thousand probes are analyzed, contributions as little as  <dig> % can correspond to several tens of probes. this is a new concept, and thus it is not generally recognized that small contributions can have meaning. therefore, although the usage of pca itself is not novel, the method used in this study is new.

comparison with tissue samples associated with metastasis
although we detected many significant results in this study, the original observation of the analysis was cell lines. since cell lines have a greater tendency to exhibit clear outcomes than tissues, it is unclear whether the study results could be observed using more relevant samples, such as tissues. to confirm this, we consulted a database that stores the expression of tissues with and without metastasis. unfortunately, we could not find a data set where nsclc tissues were treated. thus, we compared melanoma with and without metastasis . because metastasis is commonly caused by similar factors, e.g, the loss of cell adhesion, independent of the type of cancer, comparison of melanoma with and without metastasis was expected to share aberrant mrna expression with nsclc with and without metastasis . although not all eleven genes were observed, among seven of the genes included, six had a p-vales < <dig>  by kolmogorov-smirnov  test. the ks test was used because it is more robust  than the t-test, thus was more suitable for samples with a high background noise such as tissues. the results shown in table  <dig> suggest that the findings in this cell line might also be observed in tissue samples.

values were computed using the kolmogorov-smirnov test. p-values < <dig>  highlighted in bold.

transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor targets selected eleven genes
although the biological significance of individual genes was confirmed, it would be more useful if biological reasons for the commonality between the genes could be identified. we uploaded mrna refseq ids for eleven genes to david  <cit>  and found that all eleven genes were targets of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor , reported to be primary factor that causes lung cancer  <cit> . ahr was also suggested to promote metastasis  <cit> . given that promoter methylation is primarily related to transcription factors binding to promoters, it is reasonable that ahr was identified by the integrated analysis of mrna expression and promoter methylation. this also suggests that our methodology and analysis are suitable for identification of potential cancer causing genes for nsclc.

CONCLUSIONS
this study performed the integrated analysis of promoter methylation and gene expression using pca based unsupervised fe. it selected eleven genes that were differently expressed and which had different promoter methylation patterns between cell lines with and without metastasis ability. p-values attributed to the simultaneous selection between gene expression and promoter methylation were significant and many cancer-related diseases were associated with the eleven genes selected. two of the eleven genes selected, b3galnt <dig> and tinagl <dig>  were identified as drug target candidates that might suppress metastasis in nsclc. further detailed and advanced studies are required to confirm these findings.
