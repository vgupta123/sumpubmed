BACKGROUND
because of their sessile nature, plants have evolved very sophisticated mechanisms to actively cope with different sorts of stresses. the various defense mechanisms are controlled by signaling molecules like salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , and ethylene, or by combinations of these signal compounds. sa accumulates locally in infected leaves, as well as in non-infected systemic leaves after infection with biotrophic pathogens and mediates the induced expression of defense genes, resulting in an enhanced state of defense known as systemic acquired resistance   <cit> . sar is a long-lasting broad-spectrum resistance against a variety of pathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses  <cit> . also exogenous application of sa results in induced expression of defense related genes  <cit> . among the genes that are induced during sar is a set of genes collectively known as pr  genes, with members encoding anti-fungal β- <dig> -glucanases , chitinases  and pr- <dig>  which are often used as molecular markers for sar  <cit> .

genetic studies have revealed important components of the sa signal transduction pathway, briefly outlined as follows: after perception of pathogen attack by cytoplasmic tir-nb-lrr receptors, several genes are involved in initiation of the defense response. one of these genes is enhanced disease susceptibility  <dig> , which is probably activated after elicitor perception  <cit> . eds <dig> heterodimerizes with phytoalexin deficient  <dig>  and their nuclear localization is important for subsequent steps in the signaling pathway  <cit> . both eds <dig> and pad <dig> are induced by pathogen infection and sa application. another enhanced disease susceptibility gene  that is also situated upstream of sa biosynthesis is expressed at high levels upon pathogen infection in an eds1- and pad4-dependent manner  <cit> . the eds <dig> mutant plants are no longer able to accumulate high levels of sa upon pathogen infection and are unable to initiate the sar response  <cit> .

biosynthesis of sa can occur via two different pathways, the pathway that synthesizes sa from phenylalanine  <cit> , and the isochorismate pathway. inhibition of the phenylalanine pathway still allows accumulation of sa  <cit> . an important step in the isochorismate pathway is the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate . expression of a bacterial ics gene in plants causes accumulation of sa, constitutive expression of pr genes and constitutive sar  <cit> , whereas the sid <dig> mutant corresponding with a defective ics <dig> gene, is compromised in accumulation of sa and unable to mount sar  <cit> . expression of the ics <dig> gene is rapidly induced after infection  <cit> . avrpphb susceptible  <dig> , of which the pathogen-induced expression is highly correlated with expression of ics <dig>  is acting downstream of sa. in the pbs <dig> mutant, accumulation of sa-glucoside and expression of pr- <dig> are drastically reduced. the pbs <dig> gene product is a member of the auxin-responsive gh <dig> family of acyl-adenylate/thioester forming enzymes of which some have been shown to catalyze hormone-amino acid conjugation, like the protein encoded by the jar <dig> gene that catalyzes the formation of ja-isoleucine. however, the observation that pbs <dig> is not active on sa, ina and chorismate leads to the hypothesis that pbs <dig> must be placed upstream of sa  <cit> .

although many mutants have been reported to affect sa accumulation, no direct transcriptional regulators of genes like ics <dig> or pbs <dig> have been identified. for ics <dig> the presence of many tgac core sequences, as present in the binding sites for wrky transcription factors, has been hypothesized to be important for transcriptional regulation of ics <dig> gene expression  <cit> . here we describe two wrky transcription factors that were previously identified in our group via a bioinformatics analysis to be closely co-expressed with ics <dig> and pbs <dig>  co-expression analyses in protoplasts showed that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> positively regulated the expression of ics <dig> and pbs <dig>  respectively. in addition, the binding sites for wrky <dig> in the ics <dig> promoter were identified.

our results indicate that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  which themselves are both rapidly induced by pathogen elicitors  <cit> , link pathogen-triggered defense gene expression to the accumulation of sa via induction of ics <dig> and pbs <dig> gene expression.

RESULTS
wrky <dig> activates ics1::gus gene expression in arabidopsis protoplasts
the co-expression analysis from van verk et al.  <cit>  indicated that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> could play a role in regulation of ics <dig> and pbs <dig>  to verify that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> can act as positive transcriptional regulators of ics <dig> and/or pbs <dig> gene expression we performed transactivation assays in arabidopsis protoplasts. protoplasts were cotransfected with plasmids containing either the wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> coding region behind the 35s promoter, together with a plasmid containing the gus reporter gene cloned behind the  <dig> kb promoter region of ics <dig> or of pbs <dig>  as controls, the promoter::gus fusions were cotransfected with an "empty" plasmid lacking the wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> coding region. the results of these transactivation assays are shown in figure  <dig>  ics <dig> promoter-directed gus expression is increased approximately 4-fold by wrky <dig> in comparison to the empty vector control. no increase is observed after cotransfection with the wrky <dig> plasmid. in the case of pbs <dig> promoter-directed gus expression, neither wrky <dig> nor wrky <dig> positively stimulated gene expression.

to analyze the effect of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> on expression of endogenous ics <dig> and pbs <dig> genes, arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with 35s::wrky <dig> or 35s::wrky <dig> plasmids and incubated overnight, after which total rna was isolated for qrt-pcr analysis of the expression of the endogenous ics <dig> and pbs <dig> genes. often, wrkys positively regulate their own expression  <cit>  and therefore expression of the endogenous wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> genes was also investigated. the constitutive housekeeping genes actin <dig>  actin <dig>  actin <dig> and β-tubelin were used as controls. the results of the qrt-pcr analyses are shown in figure  <dig>  wrky <dig> overexpression resulted in a  <dig>  fold increase of ics <dig> mrna. this suggests the presence of wrky <dig> responsive elements in the ics <dig> promoter, at least part of which are present in the  <dig> kb fragment analyzed in figure  <dig>  wrky <dig> did not increase expression of the pbs <dig> gene. apparently, neither the  <dig> kb fragment of the pbs <dig> promoter  nor the full-length promoter contains wrky <dig> responsive elements. overexpression of wrky <dig> had no effect on expression of the ics <dig> gene, indicating that the full-length promoter of this gene does not contain wrky <dig> responsive elements. however, wrky <dig> overexpression resulted in a 4-fold increase of pbs <dig> mrna accumulation. this suggests that the pbs <dig> promoter contains wrky <dig> responsive elements, located more than  <dig> kb upstream of the transcription start site. obviously, there is no positive effect of wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> on the expression of the corresponding endogenous wrky genes, but both wrkys did have a slightly negative effect on the expression of the endogenous wrky <dig> gene.

characterization of the wrky <dig> binding sites in the ics <dig> promoter
wrky proteins are generally considered to bind to the consensus w-box sequence ttgac  <cit> . the  <dig> kb ics <dig> promoter does not contain a true w-box, although a number of tgac core sequences is present . furthermore, a wk-like box  that resembles the wk-box ttttccac identified by van verk et al.  <cit>  is present at position - <dig>  as a first step towards the characterization of wrky <dig> binding sites in the ics <dig> promoter, we prepared 30-bp promoter fragments that contained a tgac core sequence or the wk-like box in the center.  after labeling, the fragments were assayed for their ability to bind to a purified glutathione s-transferase /wrky <dig> fusion protein expressed in e. coli, using electrophoretic mobility shift assays . the results of emsas with these fragments as probes are shown in figure 3a. the shifted band in lane  <dig> indicates that the 30-bp fragment containing the two cores at - <dig> and - <dig> was bound to the gst/wrky <dig> fusion protein. with none of the other wk-like or w-box core sequences a shift was observed . to verify the binding specificity of the 30-bp fragment containing the tgac cores at positions - <dig> and - <dig>  competition experiments were done with 50- and 250-fold excess unlabelled fragments . evidently, addition of a 250-fold excess unlabelled fragment completely outcompeted the binding to the probe , indicating that this ics <dig> promoter fragment specifically interacted with wrky <dig> 

we speculated that the two tgac core sequences at - <dig> and - <dig> could be binding sites for wrky <dig> and set out to further investigate which site is responsible for the observed shift. therefore, a scanning analysis was performed with a series of annealed complementary oligonucleotide probes in which the coresequences were changed to ccgg . the results of emsas with these fragments are shown in figure 4a, lanes  <dig> to  <dig>  mutation of either the core at - <dig>  or at - <dig>  does not abolish binding of wrky <dig> to the fragment . however, mutation of both cores in mutant m1+ <dig> disrupts binding . this suggests that both binding sites are equally important.

to further analyze the requirements for binding of wrky <dig>  pairwise mutations of the sequence around the core at - <dig> were scanned in an m <dig> background . the results are shown in figure 4a, lanes  <dig> to  <dig>  mutations m <dig>  and m <dig>  show binding to wrky <dig> . as expected, mutations within the core sequence completely abolished binding of wrky <dig> . since the tgac core at - <dig> has tc upstream of the core and the inverted core at - <dig> has a ct in this position, we checked to which extend the t or c nucleotides are important for binding. changing ct to tc resulted in a binding of wrky <dig> that was as strong as to the wild type sequence . changing ct to tt significantly lowered binding , suggesting that the presence of a c at either position - <dig> or - <dig> from the core is important for binding wrky <dig>  we further analyzed the effect of mutations at positions -3/- <dig> and +3/+ <dig> from the core. pairwise mutation of nucleotides at -3/- <dig> did not alter the binding of wrky <dig> , however no shift was observed when the nucleotides at +3/+ <dig> were mutated, indicating that this flanking sequence is important for binding of wrky <dig> .

to summarize the results of the emsas, figure 5a shows the  <dig> bp ics <dig> promoter with the characterized wrky <dig> binding sites indicated against a grey background. a schematic representation of the fragments tested in emsas for binding wrky <dig> is given in figure 5b. figure 5c shows the consensus binding sequence with an essential c at either the - <dig> or - <dig> position, which was generated using the program weblogo  <cit>  by combination of the characterized binding sites and the results of the mutational analysis of the binding site at - <dig> 

mutational analysis of wrky28-mediated activationof ics1::gus gene expression in arabidopsis protoplasts
the results from the transactivation assays, qrt-pcr and emsa experiments indicate that wrky <dig> plays a role in inducible ics <dig> gene expression. to more directly demonstrate that the binding sites at positions - <dig> and - <dig> are involved in wrky <dig> activation of ics <dig> gene expression, arabidopsis protoplasts were cotransfected with a wrky <dig> expression plasmid together with a plasmid containing the gus reporter gene cloned either behind the  <dig> bp wild-type ics <dig> promoter or behind ics <dig> promoters with the m <dig>  m <dig> and m1+ <dig> mutations as indicated in figure 4b were introduced in the  <dig> kb ics <dig> promoter and their effects studied in cotransfection experiments in arabidopsis protoplasts. the results of these transactivation assays are shown in figure  <dig>  while cotransfection of 35s::wrky <dig> with the wild-type ics <dig> promoter::gus increased gus expression approximately  <dig> -fold in comparison to the basal level obtained in protoplasts cotransfected with the empty vector, expression dropped significantly with promoter constructs containing the m <dig> or m <dig> mutation . combination of m <dig> and m <dig>  did not lower gus expression more than the single mutations . this result supports the notion that wrky <dig> activates ics <dig> expression through specific binding sites in the promoter at - <dig> and - <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site.

chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
the transactivation experiments in protoplasts and the in vitro binding studies described above support a role for wrky <dig> as a transcriptional activator of ics <dig>  to check if wrky <dig> is able to bind to the ics <dig> promoter in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays were set up using arabidopsis protoplasts, as described by  <cit> . the wrky <dig> coding sequence was fused to a haemagglutinin  tag and expressed in arabidopsis protoplasts. the resulting wrky28-ha fusion protein was able to induce gus expression when cotransfected with an ics <dig> promoter::gus construct, indicating that the ha tag did not interfere with wrky28's functionality .

for chip analysis wrky28-ha or unfused ha were expressed in protoplasts. after  <dig> h incubation, chromatin complexes were cross-linked using formaldehyde. upon exhaustive shearing by sonication, the fragmented chromatin was incubated with monoclonal anti-ha antibodies overnight, after which immunoprecipitated complexes were captured using magnetic protein g beads. dna eluted from the beads was analyzed by qpcr with primers corresponding to six overlapping regions of the ics <dig> promoter . qpcrs with primers corresponding to the coding region of pr <dig> and the promoter region of pdf <dig>  were included as controls. the results are shown in figure 7b. with the primer sets corresponding to pr <dig> and pdf <dig>  no specific products were amplified, indicating that these sequences were absent from the immunoprecipitated chromatin. while no specific pcr products were amplified with primer sets a, b, d, e and f, it is evident that the region corresponding to the ics <dig> promoter bordered by primers c was highly enriched in the immunoprecipitated chromatin from the wrky28-ha transfected protoplasts . this region contains the two wrky <dig> binding sites at - <dig> and - <dig> as determined by emsa . a similar result was obtained with a primer pair covering a smaller region containing the two binding sites . in conclusion, the chip assays indicated that wrky <dig> specifically binds to the ics <dig> promoter in vivo, most probably to one or both binding sites at position - <dig> and - <dig> upstream of the transcription start site.

discussion
wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> activate expression of ics <dig> and pbs <dig>  respectively
our in silico co-expression analysis of arabidopsis transcription factor genes and genes involved in stress signaling suggested many putative new components of the signal transduction pathways  <cit> . among the genes resulting from this screening were two encoding wrky transcription factors linked to genes involved in sa metabolism. the gene encoding the wrky type ii member wrky <dig> was found to be closely co-regulated with the ics <dig> gene involved in sa biosynthesis, whereas the type iii wrky <dig> gene linked to pbs <dig>  based on this finding we decided to investigate the effects of these wrkys on transcriptional activation of ics <dig> and pbs <dig>  indeed, overexpression of wrky <dig> in arabidopsis protoplasts led to enhanced gus activity from a co-expressed gus reporter gene under control of a  <dig> kb ics <dig> promoter, and also expression of the endogenous ics <dig> gene was increased . likewise, overexpression of wrky <dig> resulted in increased accumulation of pbs <dig> mrna, supporting the notion that wrky <dig> is a transcriptional activator of pbs <dig> . gus activity was not enhanced from a co-expressed  <dig> kb pbs <dig> promoter::gus gene. this suggests that wrky <dig> may activate the pbs <dig> gene by binding at a position in the promoter further upstream than  <dig> kb. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the  <dig> kb promoter used for the construction of the reporter construct and which was derived from curated genome sequence data by the arabidopsis information resource , is not the actual pbs <dig> promoter. a detailed analysis of the region upstream of the coding sequence in the arabidopsis genome shows that the intron of almost  <dig> kb suggested to be present in the 5'-utr of pbs <dig> contains several putative binding sites for transcription factors like wrkys and tgas. it will be interesting to investigate if the suggested "intron" is the actual pbs <dig> promoter.

functional analysis that would further support the important role of wrky <dig> in ics <dig> gene expression were hampered by the lack of wrky <dig> knock-out mutants or t-dna insertion lines, while our efforts to achieve silencing of wrky <dig> through agrobacterium-mediated transformation with phannibal constructs via flower dip only resulted in seedlings that died shortly after germination. these findings suggest that wrky <dig> also plays an essential role during early plant development.

dna binding site of wrky28
several studies on dna binding characteristics of wrky transcription factors have led to the generally accepted consensus binding sequence ttgac, commonly referred to as the w-box  <cit> . recently, we identified a variant binding site for the tobacco ntwrky <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . ntwrky <dig> binds to a wk-box , which deviates significantly from the w-box consensus sequence.

in this study we have characterized two sites in the ics <dig> promoter that have a high affinity for wrky <dig>  the consensus wrky <dig> binding site that emerged from this analysis has some characteristics that differ from the w-box consensus . we found that, unlike the consensus w-box, a c may be present at position - <dig> in front of the tgac core, and although a t is also allowed at - <dig>  a c is then required at - <dig>  similarly, for the sequence after the core, in one of the binding sites an a is present at + <dig>  which in the w-box is usually either a c or a t.

to disable binding of wrky <dig> to the 30-bp emsa probe harboring the binding sites at - <dig> and - <dig>  mutation of both these sites was necessary. with only one site intact, binding was still possible . nevertheless, with the  <dig> kb promoter, mutation of only one of the sites had a severe effect on reporter gene expression and expression was not further reduced when both sites were mutated. apparently, for transcriptional activation both sites are required. possibly, activation requires that wrky <dig> binds as a dimer, similar to wrkys  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which were found to form functionally relevant homo- and heterodimers  <cit> .

the transactivation experiments also showed that mutation of the sites at - <dig>  and - <dig>  did not completely knock out reporter gene expression. in comparison to the gus activity obtained with the wild type construct, approximately 20% remained. furthermore, the reduction in basal expression levels seen with the mutant ics <dig> promoters in the absence of overexpressed wrky <dig> indicates that also endogenous factors binding to the sites at - <dig> and - <dig> contribute to the expression level. qrt-pcr has shown that the wrky <dig> gene is much higher expressed in protoplasts than in suspension cells from which the protoplasts were made , suggesting that possibly these factors include endogenous wrky <dig>  besides the direct activation of ics <dig> gene expression, wrky <dig> might also indirectly effect the ics <dig> gene via transcriptional activation of genes encoding other transcription factors acting on the ics <dig> promoter. moreover, the residual gus expression remaining with the m <dig>  m <dig> and m1+ <dig> mutant promoters could indicate that other sites in the ics <dig> promoter are still able to bind wrky <dig>  although the existence of such sites was not supported by the results of the chip analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
integrated model for regulation of sa biosynthesis by wrky <dig> and wrky46
the combined results of the work described here, lead us to propose the following model for the induction of sa biosynthesis upon pathogen attack. induction of the basal defense response starts with the detection of a pathogen-associated molecular pattern , like in the case of flagellin, which is perceived by the fls receptor. the activated fls receptor triggers a map kinase cascade , which leads to transcriptional activation of the wrky <dig> gene  <cit> . transcription factor wrky <dig> subsequently activates directly, and likely also indirectly via yet unknown transcription factors, expression of the ics <dig> gene, through binding the promoter at the two binding sites at - <dig> and - <dig> and possibly at other sites, resulting in synthesis of ics that catalyzes sa production. how the activated map kinase induces wrky <dig> gene expression remains a matter of speculation. the activated mapk could activate an as of yet unknown transcription factor on standby or release one from a repressor complex, or it may function itself as activator of wrky <dig> expression.

less is known about the role of the product of the pbs <dig> gene. it is rapidly induced in plants recognizing pathogens carrying virulence factors, like in the case of pseudomonas syringae containing avr <dig>  <cit> . a function in sa metabolism has been suggested based on its effect on sa-glucoside accumulation and its similarity to phytohormone-amino acylases  <cit> . pbs <dig> gene expression is repressed by high levels of sa, indicating that it is more likely that pbs <dig> functions early in the defense response before sa levels start to rise  <cit> . similarly, wrky <dig> expression is rapidly induced upon infection and our finding that it enhances pbs <dig> gene expression suggests an early role in r-gene-mediated defense. figure  <dig> shows the placement of the two wrkys in the sa-signaling pathways.
