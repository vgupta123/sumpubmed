BACKGROUND
many emerging infectious diseases are caused by zoonotic transmission, and the consequence is often unpredictable. zoonoses have been well represented with the  <dig> outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  due to a novel coronavirus  <cit> . bats are associated with an increasing number of emerging and reemerging viruses, many of which pose major threats to public health, in part because they are mammals which roost together in large populations and can fly over vast geographical distances  <cit> . many distinct viruses have been isolated or detected  from bats including representatives from families rhabdoviridae, paramyxoviridae, coronaviridae, togaviridae, flaviviridae, bunyaviridae, reoviridae, arenaviridae, herpesviridae, picornaviridae, filoviridae, hepadnaviridae and orthomyxoviridae  <cit> .

the reoviridae  comprise a large and diverse group of nonenveloped viruses containing a genome of segmented double-stranded rna, and are taxonomically classified into  <dig> genera  <cit> . orthoreoviruses are divided into two subgroups, fusogenic and nonfusogenic, depending on their ability to cause syncytium formation in cell culture, and have been isolated from a broad range of mammalian, avian, and reptilian hosts  <cit> . members of the genus orthoreovirus contain a genome with  <dig> segments of dsrna;  <dig> large ,  <dig> medium , and  <dig> small   <cit> .

the discovery of melaka and kampar viruses, two novel fusogenic reoviruses of bat origin, marked the emergence of orthoreoviruses capable of causing acute respiratory disease in humans  <cit> . subsequently, other related strains of bat-associated orthoreoviruses have also been reported, including xi river virus from china  <cit> . wong et al. isolated and characterized  <dig> fusogenic orthoreoviruses from three travelers who had returned from indonesia to hong kong during 2007– <dig>  <cit> .

in the present study we isolated a novel reovirus from intestinal contents taken from one fruit bat  in yunnan province, china. in the absence of targeted sequencing protocols for a novel virus, we applied the vidiscr  virus discovery strategy to confirm and identify a novel melaka-like reovirus, the “cangyuan virus”. to track virus evolution and to provide evidence of genetic reassortment pcr sequencing was conducted on each of the  <dig> genome segments, and phylogenetic analysis performed to determine genetic relatedness with other bat-borne fusogenic orthoreoviruses.

RESULTS
virus isolation and morphological characterization
the vero-e <dig> cells showed a syncytial cytopathic effect  after  <dig> hours of the first inoculation at 37°c . the virus was named “cangyuan virus” after the location from which the host bats  were collected . after the first passage in vero e <dig> cells, cangyuan virus began to cause syncytial cpe  <dig> hours post-inoculation; notably earlier than for melaka virus and other orthoreovirus   <cit> . qpcr analysis demonstrated that the replication of cangyuan virus began after  <dig> hours infected the vero e <dig> cells . after the second passage, virus titrations were performed and the infectious dose of cangyuan virus was  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig>  ml. qpcr analysis demonstrated that cangyuan virus is the virus replicating in the cells and responsible for the observed cpe .figure  <dig>

negative-staining em of particles in the supernatant recovered from vero e <dig> cells infected with cangyuan virus revealed non-enveloped icosahedral virus-like particles, approximately 70– <dig> nm in diameter, possessing a double capsid with conspicuous “spikes” or “turrets” situated on the inner core; features characteristic of the family reoviridae, genus orthoreovirus   <cit> .

neutralizing antibody titers
serum samples from  <dig> fruit bats  collected from cangyuan city were screened for anti-cangyuan virus neutralizing antibody. according to the neutralizing antibody titers determined in this study, the serum of two bats had a neutralizing antibody titer of  <dig>  against cangyuan virus and the serum of five bats  a titer of  <dig> against cangyuan virus. our studies indicated a 26%  prevalence for antibody titers >1: <dig> for cangyuan virus-specific antibodies in fruit bats . the control serum had a neutralizing antibody titer < <dig>  at present, it is not clear whether cangyuan virus is carried by a specific fruit bat species or by multiple bat species circulating in the region. a preliminary survey of bat sera collected in cangyuan city of yunnan province from our previous studies indicated a low prevalence of cangyuan virus-specific antibodies in at least two different insectivorous bat species: rhinolophus luctus  and small leaf-nosed bat  .

qpcr, nucleotide sequences and phylogeny
pcrs testing were repeated on the  <dig> fruit bats original samples including the kidney, heart, lung, liver, spleen, intestine, rectal swab sample, and brain samples. two bat’s qpcrs results were positive. one bat’s qpcrs result was positive in the lung, intestine sample  and rectal swab sample, and the ct  of qpcr were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively. the ct of another bat’s pcr were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the intestine sample and rectal swab sample, respectively.

to establish the evolutionary relationship between cangyuan virus and other known orthoreoviruses, homology were compared  and phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the nucleotide sequences of the l genome segments , the m genome segments  and the s genome segments . the cangyuan virus l1-l <dig>  m1-m <dig> segments sequence identity were  <dig> % – <dig> %,  <dig> %– <dig> %,  <dig> %– <dig> % ,  <dig> %– <dig> %,  <dig>  1%– <dig> %, and  <dig> %– <dig> % , respectively, by alignment with pteropine orthoreovirus  species group. the phylogenetic trees for l <dig>  l <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> segments demonstrated that cangyuan virus was most closely related to melaka and kampar viruses, and was placed in pteropine orthoreovirus  species group which covers all known bat-borne orthoreoviruses together with nelson bay orthoreovirus  <cit> .table  <dig>

to better understand the genetic relatedness of cangyuan virus to other known bat-borne orthoreoviruses, the published sequences for the s genome segment of bat-borne orthoreoviruses known for causing acute respiratory disease in humans were retrieved from genbank and used to compare homology  and construct phylogenetic trees . the cangyuan virus s1-s <dig> segments sequence identity were  <dig> %– <dig> %,  <dig> %– <dig> %,  <dig> %– <dig> %%, and  <dig> %– <dig> %, respectively . the s <dig> segment demonstrated a greater heterogeneity than other s segments in pteropine orthoreovirus  species group.

discussion
the discovery of melaka and kampar viruses provide evidence that a novel group of fusogenic orthoreoviruses of bat origin are associated with acute respiratory disease in humans  <cit> . to date, there have been six confirmed outbreaks of human respiratory illness caused by this group of viruses; three in malaysia and three in bali/hong kong  <cit> . despite a lack of direct epidemiological and clinical evidence to support the novel cangyuan orthoreovirus of bat origin isolated in this study as a causative agent of human respiratory tract infections in china, the genetic relatedness between cangyuan virus and the melaka and kampar viruses implies that it may be a zoonotic infectious agent of clinical significance to human health.

one possibility for potential virulence in humans is genome segment reassortment, which is common among segmented rna viruses, including the reoviruses  <cit> . reassortment has been reported for avian and mammalian reoviruses  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the full sequences of segments l, m and s demonstrated the genetic diversity of the cangyuan virus.

as summarized above and in figure  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the phylogenetic trees derived from the s segments demonstrated a greater heterogeneity than those derived for the corresponding l and m segments . all four possible topologies were observed for the s segments of the ten strains: cangyuan virus was clustered with the pulau virus ; cangyuan virus and melaka virus clustered together ; cangyuan virus and xi river virus together ; and cangyuan virus clustered with sikamat virus .

the distinctive topology pattern of the phylogenetic tree based on the m <dig> segments  is especially interesting and may indicate two important findings  <cit> . first, it further confirms the notion, derived from the topology of the s segment trees, that genetic reassortment may have occurred among the malaka related orthoreoviruses  <cit> . second, the cangyuan virus m <dig> segment shared sequence identities of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  1% with the m <dig> segments of kampar, malaka, pulau and nelson bay viruses, respectively . the tree based on m <dig> segments indicates a great divergence of the cangyuan and kampar virus segments from those of the other three strains. this may suggest a new genotype represented by the cangyuan and kampar virus m <dig> segment  <cit> . the difference in sequence homology between segments of the reovirus strains suggested that genetic reassortment may have occurred among the bat-borne melaka related orthoreoviruses.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the cangyuan virus was closely related to the malaka and kampar viruses and that a prevalence of cangyuan virus-specific antibodies was present in fruit bat families circulating in yunnan province, china. this further highlights the urgent need to systematically survey bat-borne viruses in south china so as to enable us to conduct more effective risk assessment, to provide forecast and devise better prevention and control strategies for potential future outbreaks.
