BACKGROUND
maize  kernel moisture at harvest is an important trait in temperate regions because costly additional drying is needed to reach 15% water content, which is the level compatible with good seed preservation during storage. although yield is correlated to maximum water content occurring approximately 40- <dig> days after pollination   <cit>  and to a lesser extent to kernel moisture at maturity  <cit> , the yield/moisture ratio at maturity is variable enough to allow selection for both higher yield and lower moisture at harvest  <cit> . for example, recurrent selection has been successfully applied for reduction of kernel moisture by the introduction of tropical germplasm into temperate-adapted germplasm  <cit> . indirect inbred selection criteria to reduce gain moisture, based on husk senescence have been proposed  <cit> . the biochemical, biophysical and molecular phenomena controlling kernel moisture at harvest intervene mainly during the maturation phase, which corresponds to the last stage of seed development after the early and the grain filling phases. physiological and genetic analyses of the maturation phase reveal a process, which both prevents early embryo germination and favours the synthesis of specialized proteins related to the acquisition of desiccation tolerance, enhancing embryo viability under strong dehydration. accordingly, in many seed species including maize, embryos separated from endosperm at the early developmental phase can grow and germinate when placed in tissue culture, but their germination ability decreases as maturation proceeds  <cit> .

despite considerable progress in recent years in knowledge of maturation, the number of genes thought to be involved in regulation of kernel moisture remains extremely limited. the late embryogenesis abundant  proteins including the dehydrin family, are specifically produced during the maturation phase  <cit> . although they have been assumed for a long time to protect cellular and molecular structures from the damaging effect of desiccation  <cit> , only recent results shed some light on their precise action. cytoplasmic lea proteins prevent protein aggregation due to water loss in vitro  <cit>  and mitochondria lea proteins protect two matrix enzymes, fumarase and rhodanese  <cit> . other proteins likely to be involved in kernel desiccation are the water channel aquaporins, which are present in nearly all organs. an extensive study of maize aquaporins described  <dig> full length cdnas distributed into four groups comprising  <dig> plasma membrane  and  <dig> tonoplast  intrinsic proteins  <cit> . among them, zmpip1; <dig>  zmpip1; <dig>  zmpip1; <dig>  zmpip2; <dig>  zmpip2; <dig>  zmpip2; <dig>  tip1; <dig> and tip2; <dig> were reported to be expressed in reproductive tissues. in rice , ostip <dig> and ostip <dig> are expressed in mature seeds in the embryo and the aleurone layer, respectively. because members of the pip <dig> and tip <dig> families have much higher water transport capacities than those of the pip <dig> family  <cit> , aquaporins of the first two families may be of higher significance for desiccation.

the phytohormone abscisic acid  appears to play a central role in both the establishment of embryo dormancy and the synthesis of lea proteins, as demonstrated by mutants impaired in aba synthesis or sensitivity. aba deficient maize mutants are viviparous, i.e. embryos germinate precociously on the ear  <cit> , their vivipary being prevented by aba addition. aba synthesis mutants of arabidopsis  and tomato  have also impaired seed maturation and dormancy but are not viviparous  <cit> . interestingly, maize plants with white endosperm  have higher moisture than those with yellow endosperm  <cit> . this is due to the fact that the y <dig> mutation causes a defect in phytoene synthase , an enzyme involved in both carotenoid and aba synthesis  <cit> , highlighting the likely role of aba in regulating kernel moisture. furthermore, the expression of many lea genes and more generally members of the responsive to aba  gene family, is induced by exogenous aba  <cit> .

the aba biosynthetic and catabolic pathways are now well understood since almost all the biosynthetic genes have been identified through the isolation of auxotrophic mutants  <cit> . the enzymes downstream of the xanthophyll cycle are specific to aba biosynthesis. the cloning and characterization of maize viviparous <dig> , which encodes 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  <dig>  catalyzing the cleavage of the c <dig> neoxanthin chain into the c <dig> aba skeleton xanthoxin  <cit> , led to the identification of nced as a rate controlling enzyme. indeed, maize nced <dig> mutants have a strongly reduced kernel aba content  <cit>  and in arabidopsis, nced <dig> overexpression confers a significant increase in aba accumulation in the plant  <cit> . in arabidopsis, nine nced-related sequences have been identified and phylogenetic analysis has indicated that five of these clustered with functionally characterized nced proteins from other species  <cit> . aside from this main regulatory step in the aba biosynthesis pathway, other metabolic steps of aba metabolism also contribute to determining aba level. one is the conversion of zeaxanthin into violaxanthin catalyzed by zeaxanthin epoxidase , which is encoded by a single-copy gene in arabidopsis and tobacco  and whose overexpression causes an enhanced accumulation of aba in seeds  <cit> . the cloning and characterization of the maize viviparous10/viviparous <dig>  and viviparous <dig>  genes further demonstrated that aba biosynthesis is also dependent on a molybdenum cofactor involved in the abscisic aldehyde oxidase reaction, the last step of aba biosynthesis  <cit> . in addition, the recent discovery that viviparous <dig>  encodes a putative peptidase, together with the predominant effect of vp <dig> mutant on aba synthesis and turnover in maize embryos, indicate that aba level is also controlled indirectly through regulation of seed-specific factors  <cit> .

the mutant approach is powerful in identifying the mandatory steps  in a pathway, but it does not provide any insight into the relative impact of each step on the quantitative value of the final product  of the pathway. the genetic variability of quantitative traits is controlled by one or generally several loci named quantitative trait loci  which may be mapped using appropriate segregating populations. in addition, the relative contribution of each locus to the trait genetic variation and the allelic effect at each locus may be estimated. more than  <dig> years ago, robertson proposed a very fruitful hypothesis bridging mutation and qtl approaches by simply saying that the "qualitative and quantitative traits may be the result of different types of variation of genic dna at the loci involved"; in other words minor allelic effects produce quantitative variations, while major variations  produce qualitative variations   <cit> . this opened the way for research aiming at the identification of the genes underlying qtls. the considerable international efforts in mapping known function genes in maize now provide rather precise genetic maps that can be used to identify candidate genes from their map common location with detected qtls  <cit> . this comparison is easier when dealing with physiological and biochemical traits since the number of possible candidate genes may be restricted to those encoding enzymes or cofactors acting in relevant pathways  <cit> . however, one limitation is the confidence interval of the qtl position which may reach more than  <dig> centimorgans  in classical recombinant inbred lines  as illustrated in one of the few reports on qtl for kernel moisture and drying rate  <cit> . a way to reduce this interval is to increase the number of recombination events by the inclusion of four generations of random intermating after the second generation and before the single seed descent, thus providing intermated recombinant inbred lines in which the qtl confidence interval is substantially reduced by a factor of two to three  <cit> . the candidate gene selection is thus facilitated. a useful criterion to validate the identified candidate genes is to examine the corresponding gene expression during the process under investigation  <cit> . differences in the transcription level related to the trait variation may support the role of the functional difference of the parental alleles.

much remains to be learned about the genes explaining the variability in the desiccation rate and the genetic relationship between this process and aba content. here, we describe a qtl-candidate gene analysis of the desiccation process in maize using an intermated recombinant inbred line population  derived from the cross between the maize inbred lines f <dig> and f <dig> differing in desiccation rate. first, qtls were searched for traits related to kernel moisture and aba content in the endosperm and the embryo during kernel desiccation. second, an extensive data mining of the genes mapped in the confidence interval of the qtls was performed in order to short list candidate genes with annotations related to desiccation rate and/or aba content. in addition to these in silico studies, six members of the nced gene family and two members of the zep gene family were identified and mapped by pcr amplification and sequencing. third, expression profiles of the candidate genes during desiccation were examined by rt-pcr experiments for correlations with kernel desiccation rates or changes in aba content.

RESULTS
genetic variability in desiccation rate and aba content
kernel water content relative to dry weight  was evaluated in the two parental inbred lines and the segregating lhrf_f3: <dig> population. this trait continuously declined from  <dig> dap when the kernel was still in the filling stage and long before the onset of the maturation stage at  <dig> dap . however, kernel water content  reached a maximum between  <dig> to  <dig> dap . this maximum corresponded to the end of the intensive starch accumulation and indicated the beginning of the desiccation-maturation process. thus, further data presentation was limited to the 30- <dig> dap period. the two parental lines had different desiccation rates, especially after  <dig> dap, f <dig> line having approximately 9% less moisture /fw*100) than f <dig> line at harvest .

the lhrf_f3:4segregating population derived from the cross between the f <dig> and the f <dig> parental inbred lines differing in desiccation rate. fw: kernel fresh matter weight ; dw: kernel dry matter weight ; %dw = dw/fw× 100; water: kernel water content ; abaend: aba in endosperm ; abaemb: aba in embryo ; slope: regression line slope of  as a function of thermal time; rate = /.

mean aba concentration in the lhrf_f3: <dig> population, when expressed on dw basis, declined drastically from  <dig> to  <dig> dap and then, increased slightly up to  <dig> dap . similar kinetics albeit with a much lower amplitude between  <dig> and  <dig> dap was observed when aba was expressed on fw basis, whereas the aba content per mg of water increased continuously and markedly after  <dig> dap . because aba is water soluble, the later mode of expression was likely the most physiologically relevant, but also the most difficult to obtain when working with lyophilized powder as in the present experiments. the interpretation of global changes at the kernel level was further complicated by large differences between the different kernel parts, aba being  <dig> to  <dig> times more concentrated in the embryo than in the endosperm . in addition, the kinetics in the two tissues was also clearly different. in the embryo, the bell-shaped aba concentration curve peaked at  <dig> dap and remained high at  <dig> dap. in contrast, aba concentration continuously declined in the endosperm . large genotypic variability among the  <dig> lhrf_f3: <dig> lines was noted in the general trend as shown by the large standard deviations. principal component analysis and pearson coefficient tables with all the measured variables showed that fw was highly correlated to dw or kernel water content  at a given dap stage, but not between stages . by contrast, regardless of the considered stage, the correlation between endosperm aba content and embryo aba content was not significant or very low . this was also true across dap stages . some low but significant correlations were noted between some water-related variables and aba content in the endosperm or the embryo at a same dap stage .

the trait variability was higher in the inbred lines than in parental lines, which is usual with a complex trait, the best line having lower moisture than f <dig> line and the worst line having higher moisture than f <dig> line , illustrating the so-called transgression effect. the existence of positive and negative allelic effects for each trait is in favour of a genotypic origin of the transgressions observed at the phenotypic level .

position in pcm on the lhrf_f3:4_ <dig> map of the segregating population. aba_embryo: aba in embryo ; aba_endosperm: aba in endosperm ; dw: kernel dry matter weight ; fw: kernel fresh matter weight ; %dw = dw/fw× 100; water: kernel water content ; rate = /; slope: regression line slope of  as a function of thermal time. the genomewide risk, p,  was computed by classical permutation for a given lod score  and reported after the lod value: * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig>  and **** p <  <dig> . the individual significance level  is  <dig>  for a  <dig>  lod score.

qtls for kernel desiccation and aba content
qtls were searched at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dap for three traits related to desiccation , for one related to growth  and for aba content either in embryo or endosperm . in addition, desiccation rate was evaluated by five traits, the slope of the fw decrease from  <dig> to  <dig> dap vs. thermal time and the slope between each of the sampling dates . a total of  <dig> qtls were detected for  <dig> of the  <dig> examined traits . out of the  <dig> traits analyzed,  <dig> displayed at least one qtl with a genomewide p value below 5%, confirming unambiguously that their variation was unlikely due to environmental effect, but rather to a genetic effect . on average, two to three qtls were detected for each trait, their sum explaining from  <dig>   to  <dig> %  of the phenotypic variation albeit rather low lod scores . the fact that each trait was measured on two plants per f3: <dig> family from the same plot  might explain these moderate effects. the experimental design did not allow for a correct estimation of heritabilities but one may assume they were low. in order to evaluate the uncertainties due to low heritability, genomewide risk was calculated for each qtl . as classically observed, the qtls for different traits tend to be grouped in clusters that were not evenly distributed in the genome . in nearly each cluster one or several qtls were detected with a genomewide risk below 5% . forty three qtls were related to kernel desiccation,  <dig> to kernel weight and  <dig> to aba concentration .

pip2; <dig> 
to compare with gene positions, qtls mapped on the lhrf_f3: <dig> segregating population  were projected on the refmap <dig> map  <cit>  using biomercator  <cit> . distances on refmap <dig> are expressed in pcm and are shown in parentheses for gene candidates. genes in bold were mapped by pcr in this study . genes involved in kernel drying and located in the vicinity of the qtl confidence interval, are indicated in grey. abi2: aba-insensitive protein phosphatase 2c 2; aip3: abi3-interacting protein 3; emb5: embryogenic-aba-inducible lea 5; pm37: seed maturation protein; psy3: phytoene synthase 3; vp1: viviparous1; wsi724: dehydrin. the asterisks behind each qtl represent the genomewide risk p  with * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig>  and **** p <  <dig> .

the largest cluster on bin  <dig>  only consisted of desiccation traits, whereas in the other clusters desiccation and growth traits were intermixed, which was expected due to the observed correlation between fw and dw at each dap stage . a focus on the  <dig> dap stage at which maximum differences in drying were observed between both genotypes , showed that among the six %dw <dig> qtls, a variable which mirrored moisture content, two colocated with fw <dig> and/or water <dig>  and three with qtls for aba content . the allele effect was consistent with the better drying performance of the f <dig> parent since four of the six %dw <dig> qtls with a cumulated r <dig> of  <dig> %  presented a positive allele effect originating from f <dig> 

qtls for aba content in embryo and endosperm were rarely colocated, which was somewhat predictable due to the poor correlation between aba contents in the two tissues. by contrast, numerous colocations were observed between desiccation traits and aba traits at eight loci , illustrated by overlaps of their qtl confidence intervals .

qtl and gene colocation
when clusters are composed of traits of different classes , qtl colocations raise the classical question of the existence of common genes which may control genetic variability of two or more classes at a single locus. a way to find candidate genes is to examine the list of reported genes which have been mapped in the qtl region. for this purpose, the qtls mapped on the lhrf_f3: <dig> population  were projected with biomercator  <cit>  on a reference map , which is based on the internationally used ibm population. the list of known or putative cdnas provided by the data base in each qtl confidence interval was manually scanned to select functions related to water transfer , kernel maturation  and aba metabolism or regulation .

relevant colocations  were observed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . it has to be noted that most colocations of interest  involved at least one qtl with a lod score higher than  <dig> , corresponding to an individual significance level below  <dig>  and a genomewide level below 25%, including eight qtls with a risk below 5% . desiccation trait clusters colocated with aquaporin ests , maturation proteins  and/or aba-related genes . surprisingly, aba biosynthetic nced <dig>  and nced <dig>  genes did not colocate with qtls for aba content but rather with qtls for desiccation. nevertheless, colocations were identified for the aba biosynthetic zep <dig>  and nced <dig>  genes and qtls for both desiccation and aba content. colocation of two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase  ests was noted with clusters comprising desiccation and aba traits . however, although very close to nced genes, ccd genes did not appear to be involved in aba biosynthesis, the encoded enzymes being able to cleave carotenoids at  <dig>   bonds to generate multiple apocarotenoid products  <cit> , whereas nceds cleaved carotenoids asymmetrically at positions 11- <dig>  <cit> . another colocation involved the aba_endosperm_80_ <dig> qtl  and the maize phytoene synthase  <dig>  gene whose expression influences abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis  <cit> . three other colocations involved qtls for both desiccation and aba content with genes encoding aquaporins  and lea proteins .

transcript expression of candidate genes related to water status, kernel maturation and aba regulation during kernel desiccation
as a first step to validate candidate genes, rt-pcr analysis was performed during kernel desiccation in both parental inbred lines for genes encoding lea proteins, aba-responsive transcription factors and aquaporins. in addition to parental differences, responses to desiccation might be classified into three categories: up-regulation, down-regulation and up-and-down-regulation . expression of lea emb <dig> and rab <dig>  genes and dehydrin rab <dig> gene increased during desiccation, especially in f <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> dap . expression of dbf <dig> and dbf <dig> genes encoding transcription factors regulating the lea rab <dig> gene  <cit>  diverged. dbf <dig> expression clearly decreased over the time, whereas dbf <dig> expression was still substantial at  <dig> dap . the dehydrin dhy <dig> gene was expressed at very low level. nevertheless, its transcript levels clearly decreased in f <dig> genotype only, a pattern clearly established for the dehydrin dhn <dig> gene . furthermore, emb <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig> genes were more strongly expressed in embryo, whereas dhn <dig> and dbf <dig> genes were mostly expressed in endosperm . this pattern was conserved in both genotypes, although the magnitude of the expression was frequently different as previously noted in fig. 3a.

among the  <dig> analyzed pip genes , only pip1; <dig>  pip1; <dig>  pip2; <dig> and pip2; <dig> were repeatedly expressed in kernels . pip1; <dig> and pip1; <dig> transcripts levels generally increased at later stages , but the time course was gene and genotype-dependent. both genes showed stronger expression in embryo than in endosperm in f <dig> genotype, while no clear preference was seen in f <dig> genotype . in contrast, pip2; <dig> and pip2; <dig> expression was more or less stable during grain desiccation , with a preferential expression of pip2; <dig> in older endosperm . the three tips tested  had expression maximum in leaf and root tissue and only tip1; <dig> was weakly expressed in kernels .

molecular analysis of maize nced and zep genes
one of the problems in analyzing accurately nced and zep expression was the design of specific primers mainly because of insufficient knowledge of the actual number and sequence of nced and zep genes in maize. therefore, we first analyzed the public databases for the presence of putative nced and zep coding sequences in maize. nine different nced loci had previously been identified with nced-like est sequences in the génoplante programme, some ests mapping to several loci . to identify a maximum of nced genes in maize, the search was extended to maize genomic contigs  and high throughput genomic sequences, which were matched with the est sequences and used to design specific primers  for dna and cdna amplification in lines f <dig> and f <dig>  focus on longest ests in the mixed cdna/genomic dna contigs allowed us to discard contigs with introns, which belonged to the ccd gene family  <cit>  and to determine six maize nced genes that could potentially encode nced proteins . phylogenetic analysis performed with the deduced nced amino acid sequences showed that the six maize proteins fell into four monocot clusters that were distinguishable from the eudicot cluster . in contrast, close homologs for each of the maize nced genes were found in rice. the two putative maize nced <dig> and nced <dig> proteins fell into a highly divergent cluster, including two maize and two rice nced proteins. the orthologs of maize nced <dig>  and nced <dig> proteins were rice nced <dig> and nced <dig> proteins, respectively. additionally, maize nced <dig> and nced <dig> proteins appeared as a pair of paralogs that was related to rice nced <dig>  whereas maize nced <dig> and nced <dig> proteins appeared as a pair of paralogs that was related to rice nced <dig>  nced <dig> , nced <dig>  nced <dig>  nced <dig> and nced <dig> genes were mapped on the lhrf mapping panel at five different loci  . nced <dig> gene was mapped on the ibm mapping panel because of no polymorphism between f <dig> and f <dig> . only nced <dig>  nced <dig> and nced <dig> corresponded to previously mapped nced-annotated ests, whereas no est was detected for maize nced <dig>  nced <dig> and nced <dig> gene loci. consistently, none of the identified nced genes mapped at the ccd loci .

four zep-annotated ests had previously been mapped at bins  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig>   in maize. nevertheless, only two maize zep genes, zep <dig>  and zep <dig> , were ascertained from our data mining and pcr fragment joining , in agreement with a recent report  <cit> , and mapped on ibm mapping panel at bins  <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig> , respectively .

transcript expression of maize nced and zep genes during kernel desiccation
colocations were identified for nced <dig> and zep <dig> loci and qtls for both desiccation and aba traits, suggesting that these aba biosynthetic genes are potential candidates . interestingly, nced <dig> , nced <dig> and nced <dig> genes mapped at loci colocating with qtls for desiccation only . therefore, transcript levels of maize nced and zep genes were quantified by quantitative rt-pcr  in embryo and endosperm from both parental lines at  <dig> and  <dig> dap, aba content being at the highest level in embryo at these stages . nced <dig> expression was not analyzed because it was not possible to design nced4-specific primers of sufficient quality for qrt-pcr.

nced <dig>  nced <dig>  nced <dig>  nced <dig> and nced <dig> transcripts were detected in all tissues analyzed, nced <dig> and nced <dig> being frequently expressed at a level close to the detection limit in most of the samples . at  <dig> dap, differential expression between embryo and endosperm was significant for the two mainly expressed nced genes, nced <dig> and nced <dig>  but the response was opposite since, in both genotypes, nced <dig> transcript was present at the highest level in the embryo, while nced <dig> was the most highly expressed transcript in the endosperm. nced <dig> had a similar pattern to that of nced <dig>  although the magnitude of the embryo-endosperm difference in transcript level was lower than for nced <dig> . there was also a genotype effect since differential expression between f <dig> and f <dig> genotypes was significant for nced <dig>  nced <dig> and nced <dig> genes . at  <dig> dap, nced <dig>  nced <dig>  nced <dig> and nced <dig> transcript levels were higher in both genotypes than at  <dig> dap . the difference between embryo and endosperm was no longer significant for nced <dig> and nced <dig> genes . in contrast, expression was significantly higher in endosperm than in embryo for nced <dig> and nced <dig> genes . additionally, the genotype effect was significant for nced <dig>  its transcript level being lower in f <dig> genotype than in f <dig> genotype in both tissues .

regarding the zep genes, at  <dig> dap, they were both mainly expressed in the endosperm rather than in the embryo . there was also a genotype effect since expression of both zep genes was higher in the f <dig> genotype than in the f <dig> genotype in both tissues. at  <dig> dap, zep <dig> preferential expression in the endosperm and higher expression in f <dig> were significant as observed at  <dig> dap but magnitude of the effects was lower . in contrast, there was no significant difference for zep <dig> expression between embryo and endosperm whatever the genotypes .

discussion
relationship between kernel moisture and kernel weight
the observed genetic variability in the desiccation rate of maize inbred lines f <dig> and f <dig> and their offspring means that this trait is amenable for breeding purposes. the use of intermated recombinant inbred lines allows the reduction of qtl confidence interval to only a few pseudo cm . on the basis of a map of roughly  <dig> pcm and a genome size of  <dig>  <dig> to  <dig>  <dig> genes per maize genome, an estimate of  <dig> to  <dig> genes per pcm is reached. with the large progress in maize sequencing http://www.maizesequence.org, in maize genetic mapping, and syntenic relationships between maize and rice, a reasonable discrimination among candidate genes is possible in a given qtl confidence interval of a few pcm. in the case of physiological traits, candidate genes may be a priori selected for validation due to the knowledge of the process under study  <cit> . although such a correlative approach does not establish direct causal relationships, it must be emphasized that the chance to find a random colocation between a qtl for the rather simple traits considered in this manuscript and a gene functionally related to the trait should be low. nevertheless, the situation is different for more complex traits involving multiple developmental or metabolic pathways and consequently a much larger number of candidate genes. using this approach, several candidates  <cit>  were identified and then validated through molecular and/or genetic studies  <cit> . in the present case, obvious candidates for desiccation qtls were lea proteins and aquaporins, whereas obvious candidates for aba qtls were key enzymes of the aba biosynthetic pathway, such as nced and zep, aba responsive genes and corresponding transcription factors.

kernel moisture and kernel weight are non independent variables. it was recently shown that maximum kernel weight  may be predicted from maximum water content  occurring at  <dig> to  <dig> dap in maize hybrids grown at three densities  <cit> . it was interpreted as meaning that maximum water content is an essential determinant of kernel volume, e.g. of sink capacity, which depends on early developmental events taking place during the lag phase. this mkw/mwc relationship was verified in the present parental lines and the lhrf_f3: <dig> population , explaining the high correlations observed between fw and water content and to a lesser extent fw and dw at each dap stage. however, it has no influence on kernel drying as shown by the absence of correlation in the lhrf_f3: <dig> population between moisture content at harvest  and final dw. the large observed variability in %dw, allowed detection of six qtls explaining ca. 50% of the variance with most fast desiccation alleles contributed by parent  <dig>  this was consistent with the higher desiccation rate of f <dig> parental line. interrogation of maize gdb http://www.maizegdb.org showed that the %dw60_ <dig> and %dw80_ <dig> qtls mapped very close to earlier reported qtls for kernel moisture on bins  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively  <cit> . comparison with the more recently reported grain moisture and drying rate qtls  <cit>  was difficult to assess because the map used was not anchored to any reference map and the qtl confidence intervals were very large. however, striking similarities were observed at bins  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  when positions were estimated proportionally to the total length of each chromosome.

candidate gene mapping and colocations with qtls
to the best of our knowledge, before the present study, qtls for aba content and water status have only been searched in leaves of plants submitted to water stress  <cit> . these qtls were compared to those for aba content and water related traits in kernel by projecting all of the qtls on the reference map. the major root-aba <dig> qtl identified near the rflp marker csu <dig> on chromosome  <dig>   <cit>  and affecting root architecture and grain yield in maize  <cit> , did not colocate with the grain aba qtls detected in the same chromosome region . nevertheless, striking similarities were observed in ten other regions . interestingly, among these ten regions, four  were detected in all studies , the common candidates being pip  and nced  genes. the coincidence of qtl locations between a source  and a sink organ  strongly suggests that common genetic factors  may control the trait at each locus. in this respect, our finding that pips are the most frequent candidate genes at the common loci is important as the data indicate that they are good candidates for the regulation of kernel moisture. of particular interest is the observation that pip1; <dig> and pip2; <dig> are highly expressed isoforms, which are associated with water relations in both leaf  <cit>  and kernel. by contrast, nced candidates only appeared in relation to qtls for leaf aba content and not to qtls for kernel aba content.

for kernel, the lhrf_f3: <dig> segregating population derived from f <dig> × f <dig> crossing. for leaf, populations derived from polj <dig> × f <dig> crossing  <cit> , high aba × low aba lines  <cit>  and f <dig> × mbs <dig> rils  <cit> . plants were submitted to water deprivation at comparable young stage in  <cit>  and  <cit> . in  <cit> , aba concentration was determined in leaf samples from stressed plants irrigated with 50% normal rainfall during stem elongation and before anthesis. gene codes are detailed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  genes in bold were mapped by pcr in this study . genes involved in kernel drying and located in the vicinity of the qtl confidence interval, are indicated in grey. aba_embryo:  in embryo; aba_endosperm:  in endosperm; abal: leaf  abax: xylem ; dw: kernel dry matter weight ; fw: kernel fresh matter weight ; %dw = dw/fw× 100; slope: regression line slope of  as a function of thermal time; rwc: relative water content; water: kernel water content ; Ψl: leaf water potential.

in addition to the above mentioned pip and nced genes, our kernel specific qtls revealed other candidates such as the abi3-interacting protein  <dig>  on chromosome 1; zep <dig> and tip2; <dig> on chromosome 2; viviparous <dig>  on chromosome 3; the seed maturation protein  <dig> , the dehydrin wsi <dig> and the aba-insensitive protein phosphatase 2c  <dig>  on chromosome 4; rab <dig>  nced <dig> and tip2; <dig> on chromosome 5; rehydrin and psy <dig> on chromosome 7; rab <dig> and ccd-est on chromosome  <dig> . the transcript patterns of lea, aquaporin, nced and zep genes during kernel maturation and desiccation provided further help for the identification of potential candidates. regarding the desiccation traits, the consistency of rab <dig>  rab <dig> and emb <dig> genes as candidates was supported by the fact that their transcript levels increased from  <dig> to  <dig> dap and was stronger in f <dig> than in f <dig>  which was consistent with the positive effect of f <dig> allele on desiccation. it is also notable that aba-responsive complex  <dig> found in rab <dig> promoter sequence  <cit>  is transactivated by vp <dig>  which colocates with slope_ <dig> qtl. the situation was not as clear for the aquaporins, although some pip <dig> and pip <dig> were very frequently associated with qtls for desiccation and aba content and pip <dig> gene expression increased by the end of the maturation phase. we suspect that specificity problem linked to the high sequence similarity between aquaporins led to cross-hybridization during rflp-based mapping and/or non-specific amplifications in rt-pcr experiments, because primers were designed from the known 3' utr b <dig> sequences, which likely differ from that of f <dig> and f <dig>  we are confident that the emerging high throughput sequencing applied to individual lines like f <dig> and f <dig> will give us the necessary tools to obtain clear-cut answers in the future.

effort was made to determine the number of nced and zep genes in the maize genome, to map the genes on the lhrf mapping panel and to determine their expression patterns in the kernel of both maize parental inbred lines. the available data at the beginning of this work were  the nced <dig>  genomic sequence from b <dig>   the map positions of nine loci identified with a nced <dig> rflp probe or similarly annotated probes and  the mapping of four partial zep cdnas at six loci. in silico analysis of genomic sequences coupled with pcr verification using genomic dna and cdna to confirm the contigs' physical existence and expression of sequence contigs, led to the identification of six nced and two zep genes in maize. these figures remain minimum estimates based on the available data, but they are consistent with other species, since five nced genes and a single copy zep gene have been found in arabidopsis and rice. the tree topology of nced1-related proteins suggests that at least four maize duplications might have occurred, one of which followed by high divergence in the branch supporting more recent duplicate nced <dig> and nced <dig> proteins. additionally, blast analysis of rice high throughput genomic sequences revealed that maize zep <dig> and zep <dig> genes were closer to each other than to the rice zep gene, suggesting a maize specific duplication . mapping of maize nced genes led to the identification of six different loci, only three being common to the nine previously reported loci. this highlights the caution needed in the interpretation of colocations between a qtl and a locus when the candidate gene was mapped using rflp probes. similar situations were found with zep genes since among the six loci identified with four partial zep-like cdnas, only two were confirmed in agreement with a recent report  <cit> .

the comparison of the transcript expression profiles of five of the six identified maize nced genes shed new light on the relative autonomy of the embryo and the endosperm compartments. accordingly, the expression patterns were independent in the endosperm and the embryo whatever the gene tested, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms. this was consistent with the absence of any correlation between aba content or its time course in endosperm and embryo. the most strongly expressed maize nced transcripts were nced <dig>  and nced <dig> in embryo and endosperm, respectively. the higher expression of nced <dig> in the embryo may explain why the vp <dig> mutation produced both a viviparous phenotype  and a kernel aba deficiency . however, the nced <dig> locus did not colocate with embryo aba qtls, although it colocated with leaf aba qtls. a way to interpret this inconsistency in the kernel would be to assume that nced <dig> is not limiting or provides a coarse control. the plausible existence of such a coarse control is consistent with the coincidence between maximum aba accumulation and maximum nced <dig> transcript level in the embryo at  <dig> dap. an additional finer control might explain the genotype differences. it is noticeable that only nced <dig> colocated with a qtl for aba , this colocation being consistent with the fact that nced <dig> transcript level was higher in the embryo than in the endosperm. nevertheless, the low transcript level and the moderate r <dig> associated with the qtl value might undermine the significance of this finding. similarly to nced <dig>  and nced <dig>  zep transcript levels were significantly different in both genotypes and both tissues at  <dig> dap. the expression of both maize zep genes was prevalent in the endosperm and higher in f <dig> line than in f <dig> line, zep <dig> being more strongly expressed than zep <dig>  interestingly, zep <dig> colocated with two qtls for aba content in the embryo at  <dig> and  <dig> dap and one qtl for aba content in endosperm at  <dig> dap.

effect of aba content on the genetic control of kernel desiccation
the potential role of aba content on the genetic control of kernel desiccation was supported by numerous colocations between qtls for both traits. the colocation of qtl for desiccation with aba-responsive genes and lea genes also known to be controlled by aba provided further support, although it did not establish a triggering role of aba on drying. to prove such a link, one would need to be able to ectopically manipulate aba content in different parts of the kernel and examine the effect on desiccation. to this end, the genes controlling aba content in grain must first be identified. nced and zep genes which were the first to be shown to have a key role in aba biosynthesis seemed good candidates prior to this study. however, among the  <dig> regions grouping the  <dig> aba qtls, only four qtls colocated with nced <dig> and zep <dig> loci. as previously mentioned, nced <dig> was expressed at a lower level than nced <dig>  which did not colocate with any aba qtls, and both zep <dig> and zep <dig> genes were mainly expressed in endosperm in which aba levels was much lower than in embryo. this can be interpreted as an indication that the control of aba levels is unlikely to be determined by transcript expression. post-transcriptional regulation should be checked by measuring nced and zep protein levels as well as their enzyme activities. other biosynthetic and/or other regulatory may also be considered. however, none of the newly reported regulator vp <dig>  vp10/vp <dig> and vp <dig> genes  <cit>  colocated with the presently detected aba qtls. it is noticeable that psy <dig> gene colocated with aba_endosperm_80_ <dig> qtl on chromosome  <dig>  nevertheless, the low levels of psy <dig> transcripts in maize endosperm  <cit>  might undermine the significance of this finding. on the other hand, the genetic control of aba content in leaf seems to present similarities to that in kernel as shown by the striking number of aba qtls of common loci between the two organs. therefore, shared qtl loci and candidates merit special attention in future work, although the control is seemingly more complex in grain than in leaf.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that kernel drying in field condition is genetically controlled. qtls for kernel water status were frequently associated with qtls for aba content in embryo and/or endosperm, providing tools for marker assisted selection. in addition, striking colocations were found between the presently mapped qtls for water status and aba concentration in kernel and those previously reported in leaf for the same traits. five novel nced genes were identified and mapped. phylogenetic analysis established homologies with rice genes. unexpectedly, it was difficult to establish a causal relationship between the expression of individual members of the maize nced and zep gene family and aba qtl effect, although a few colocations between these genes and qtls for aba were detected. among the other candidate genes mapped, colocations occurred for aquaporins, lea and aba-responsive genes and qtls for kernel desiccation, indicating the potential interest of these genes for breeding and highlighting the necessity to validate them through transgenesis and association genetics.
