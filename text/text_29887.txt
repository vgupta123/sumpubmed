BACKGROUND
structural and functional genomics studies are fundamental to the understanding of plant biology. to effectively perform such studies, it is essential to have access to high-quality genome and transcriptome sequences. the advent of second generation sequencing  technologies, such as the illumina technology, has stimulated the construction of genome and transcriptome resources for many plant species . the development of a draft genome sequence using sgs technologies generally involves three main steps: generating and assembling short sequence reads into longer dna contigs, ordering contigs along chromosomes, and annotating protein-coding genes and other elements for the contigs  <cit> . the construction of transcriptomic sequences generally entails the production and assembly of short rna-seq reads, and the assembly step can be made easier if there is a high-quality genome sequence available as a reference  <cit> .

during the development of genome and transcriptome resources, full-length transcripts can greatly increase the accuracy of genome annotation and transcriptome characterization when compared to the transcript tags assembled from short rna-seq reads. full-length transcript sequences permit efficient analysis of exon-intron structure and alternative splicing, thus facilitating a complete understanding of the transcriptional behavior of genomic loci . furthermore, the well characterized full-length transcripts are also beneficial for subsequent functional studies of important loci. on the other hand, the transcript tags derived from rna-seq may suffer from misassembly of the reads transcribed from highly repetitive regions or very similar members of multigene families  <cit> . this problem may become even more severe for polyploid plants that often harbor a large number of nearly identical homoeologous gene sets. although full-length transcripts are highly desirable, their production is often labor intensive and time consuming in the past because of the need to clone individual cdnas and to sequence them by traditional sanger sequencing . recently, the third generation sequencing technology pacbio rsii has emerged as a unique opportunity for constructing full-length transcripts  <cit> . this technology accomplishes single-molecule real-time  sequencing with a read length up to 20 kb  <cit> , which renders pacbio rsii very effective in sequencing full-length cdnas including long transcript isoforms . one concern on pacbio sequencing is its relatively high error rate, but this can be effectively improved through implementing two types of corrections, i.e., by constructing consensus sequence reads from raw pacbio subreads and by alignment with the reads generated from appropriate sgs platforms . however, compared to many successful applications in human research , the use of pacbio sequencing to assist plant transcriptome investigations has so far been limited . nevertheless, a significant progress has recently been made on using smrt cdna reads to aid the prediction and validation of plant gene models  <cit> .

owing to broad adaptability and numerous end-uses, wheat is the most widely cultivated and consumed staple food crop  <cit> . among the two main types of wheat cultivated currently, the hexaploid common wheat  is predominant, accounting for 95 % of global wheat production  <cit> . as a polyploid, the genome of common wheat is both large  and complex   <cit> . a complete reference genome sequence is still unavailable for common wheat. but a draft genome sequence, constructed mainly using illumina hiseq sequencing technology and covering about 60 % of the hexaploid genome, has recently been published for the spring-type common wheat land race chinese spring   <cit> . a large number of contigs were assembled for each of the  <dig> chromosomes, and a total of  <dig>  high-confidence genes were annotated  <cit> . because of its incomplete coverage, it is possible that many genes are missing or fragmented  in the current draft genomic sequence. thus, substantial efforts are being devoted to improve this draft genome sequence through refining contig assembly, gene annotation or both for individual chromosomes .

the a and d subgenomes of common wheat are derived from triticum urartu  and aegilops tauschii , respectively, whereas subgenome b is probably originated from an extinct aegilops species  <cit> . a natural hybridization, occurred about  <dig>  years ago between wild tetraploid wheat  and ae. tauschii, gave rise to common wheat  <cit> . thus, the a and d subgenomes of common wheat are largely syntenic with their counterparts in the diploid progenitors  <cit> . using illumina hiseq platform, draft genome sequences have been developed for t. urartu and ae. tauschii, with the number of protein-coding genes annotated for the two species being  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively  <cit> . there is also an effort to develop a detailed genomic sequence of ae. tauschii based on sequencing chromosomally ordered bac clones  <cit> , http://aegilops.wheat.ucdavis.edu/atgsp/data.php]. the contigs and annotated gene sets of t. urartu and ae. tauschii have been useful for constructing the draft genome of common wheat  <cit> . in addition, the genomic information of other sequenced grasses, including rice, brachypodium distachyon, sorghum and maize, has also aided contig ordering and gene annotation during developing cs draft genome sequence  <cit> .

grains represent the most valuable organ of common wheat, and have been the subject for numerous genetic, breeding, and more recently, functional genomics studies  <cit> . they develop after double fertilization of caryopses, and their morphometric, weight and biochemical traits are the targets of wheat yield and quality improvement efforts  <cit> . a huge number of genes and genetic interactions have been found involved in common wheat grain development and their function is often regulated at multiple levels, including temporal and spatial transcriptional regulations  <cit> . because of this complexity, our understanding of the genes functioning in common wheat grain development is still incomplete, which is not conducive for effectively improving the yield and end-use traits of this important crop.

the main objectives of this study were to sequence the transcripts expressed during common wheat caryopsis development using the emerging smrt sequencing platform pacbio rsii, and to assess the resultant data for improving common wheat genome annotation and grain transcriptome research. towards these aims, we first identified a population of full-length non-chimeric  smrt cdna reads from a pooled sample of unfertilized caryopses and developing grains using pacbio sequencing. then we mapped the reads to the draft genome sequence of cs, and performed an in-depth analysis of the high-quality reads. finally, we examined the value of the flnc reads for finding full-length transcript sequence of the genes encoding three complex families of gluten proteins: high-molecular weight glutenin subunits , low-molecular weight glutenin subunits  and gliadins. these proteins are specifically expressed in the developing grains and are important determinants of the processing and nutritional qualities of common wheat  <cit> . we also produced transcriptomic reads using hiseq  <dig> for the unfertilized caryopsis and developing grain samples, separately, for three purposes, i.e., error correction of flnc reads, validation of exon-intron junction sequence in flnc reads, and investigation of the genes whose transcription was differentially regulated during caryopsis development. the experimental variety used in this work, xiaoyan  <dig>  is an elite winter-type common wheat line with super end-use quality  <cit> . understanding the transcripts during the grain development of xiaoyan  <dig> may provide useful transcriptome resource for genetically enhancing the end-use quality of common wheat.

RESULTS
transcript sequencing and error correction
using mrnas extracted from a pooled sample of unfertilized caryopses and developing grains collected at  <dig>   <dig> and 25 days after anthesis , two different libraries, with cdna insert size < 2 kb and ≥ 2 kb, respectively, were prepared. each library was sequenced using four smrt cells on pacbio rsii platform. in total, we obtained  <dig>  continuous long reads , including  <dig>  from the short-insert library and  <dig>  from the long-insert library . following a previous publication  <cit> , the clrs were divided into two types, type i containing two or more subreads and type ii with only one subread. from type i clrs we identified a total of  <dig> , <dig> subreads, which formed  <dig>  circular consensus sequences  after merging and error correction through subread comparison . of the  <dig>  ccss,  <dig>  were found to be flnc reads because each of them contained a distinct poly tail and the 5′ and 3′ cdna synthesis primers. the type ii clrs carried  <dig>  subreads, from which  <dig>  flnc reads were identified . consequently, a total of  <dig>  flnc reads  were obtained.

to make further correction of the  <dig>  reads, we generated illumina hiseq  <dig> transcriptomic reads for each of the unfertilized caryopsis and developing grain samples. after adaptor sequence trimming and low-quality read filtering, we obtained averagely  <dig>  million reads  for each of the four samples . the proovread software, which had been found highly efficient for correcting smrt sequences through iterative short read consensus  <cit> , was used to correct  <dig>  reads. before proovread correction, the average alignment identity of the  <dig>  reads to cs draft genome sequence was  <dig>  %. this value was increased to  <dig>  % after proovread correction. we therefore focused our subsequent investigations on the  <dig>  error corrected flnc reads.

estimation of the proportion of flnc reads carrying complete open reading frame
to evaluate the proportion of flnc reads carrying complete open reading frame , we made use of the  <dig> wheat full-length cdnas published previously  <cit>  and the draft genome sequence of cs. after mapping wheat full-length cdnas and flnc reads to the draft genome using the software gmap  <cit> ,  <dig> gene loci were found to be covered by both data sources. the number of flnc reads assigned to the  <dig> loci was  <dig> . out of the  <dig>  reads,  <dig>   carried complete orf  as defined in the wheat full-length cdnas.

genome mapping of  <dig>  flnc reads
first, the  <dig>  flnc reads were mapped against the draft genome sequence of cs using gmap. during mapping, the alignment direction of  <dig>  reads could not be reliably determined. therefore, the genome mapping characteristics of the remaining  <dig>  reads were further investigated. these reads could be divided into five groups . g <dig> consisted of  <dig>  reads , each of which could be mapped to one unique location with higher than 90 % coverage and identity. thus, the g <dig> reads were mapped to the draft genome sequence with high-confidence. g <dig> contained  <dig>  reads showing multiple best alignments . g <dig> included  <dig>  reads exhibiting partial mapping to two or more distinct draft genome contigs . g <dig> had  <dig> reads generally showing low-quality alignment to the draft genome . finally, g <dig> contained  <dig> reads with no significant mapping to the draft genome.fig.  <dig> mapping flnc reads to the draft genome sequence of chinese spring . a division of the  <dig>  flnc reads into five groups  based on their genome mapping characteristics. the number of reads in each group is depicted in the pie chart. b an example illustrating the flnc read mapped to two different cs contigs located on the same chromosome arm. the read is shown as a split-mapped molecule  with both exon  and intron  depicted. the arrow indicates the direction of alignment to the genomic sequence. the two cs contigs to which the shown flnc read mapped were both located on the long arm of chromosome 1d . the representative transcripts annotated for the two contigs by the draft genome sequence of cs are shown below as smms . the bottom panel is the ae. tauschii contig orthologous to the two 1dl contigs of cs. the transcript annotated for this ae. tauschii contig is also provided as a smm . the ae. tauschii contig was identified by mapping the exemplary flnc read to the dt genome sequencing database . the diagrams shown are not drawn to scale



second, we examined the level of splice junction support with hiseq transcriptomic reads for the well mapped g <dig> flnc reads. as anticipated, nearly all of the splice junction sties  in the  <dig>  g <dig> reads were supported by hiseq transcriptome data. the most frequent splice junction was gt-ag , followed by gc-ag , at-ac  and some other minor types . these findings conformed to the consensus splice sites of higher plants .

third, we investigated mapping characteristics of the reads in g <dig> and g <dig>  among the  <dig>  g <dig> reads, a few  exhibited less than 90 % identity or coverage values when mapped to cs draft genome sequence, and were not considered further. of the remaining  <dig>  g <dig> reads,  <dig> showed one best mapping in all three  or two  subgenomes;  <dig> exhibited mapping to two or more chromosomal locations in one of three subgenomes;  <dig> were mapped to two or all three subgenomes with multiple mapping  found in at least one subgenome . therefore, the g <dig> reads were most likely transcribed from highly similar homoeologous and/or paralogous loci. among the  <dig>  g <dig> reads,  <dig> were mapped to two different contigs, whereas the remaining  <dig>  reads displayed alternative and complex mapping patterns. interestingly, of the  <dig> reads,  <dig> bridged different cs contigs generally from the same chromosome arm , suggesting that the genes giving rise to the  <dig> reads may not be adequately covered by the current cs draft genome sequence. to investigate this possibility, these reads were compared to the dt genome sequence of ae. tauschii constructed based on a high-quality physical map and bac clone sequencing   <cit> . we found  <dig> different cases where the two separate cs draft genome contigs bridged by a g <dig> flnc read were actually contiguous in the dt genome sequence . a total of  <dig> similar cases were found when the 4219 g <dig> reads were compared to the scaffolds of t. urartu draft genome sequence . clearly, many of the g <dig> reads were likely useful for improving the contig assembly of cs draft genome sequence.

lastly, because the flnc reads in g <dig> and g <dig> showed low-quality or no apparent mapping to cs draft genome sequence, we investigated if some of them might have corresponding orthologous genes in the au genome of t. urartu or the dt genome of ae. tauschii. these reads were therefore aligned to the annotated protein-coding genes of t. urartu  and ae. tauschii   <cit> . assuming that some of the flnc reads were mapped to distinct genes in the au or dt genomes with both coverage and identity values higher than 90 %, then it might be possible that the orthologous common wheat loci do exist but are inadequately, or not yet, covered by the current draft genome sequence. as displayed in additional file  <dig>  the g <dig> flnc reads having corresponding genes in t. urartu and ae. tauschii amounted to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and a number of g <dig> reads were also found to have corresponding genes in both species. these data supported the assumption that many gene loci were still missing in the present draft genome sequence of cs.

detailed characterization of g <dig> flnc reads
for further analyzing the  <dig>  well mapped g <dig> flnc reads, more stringent criteria were adopted during finding their genomic loci in cs draft genome sequence using gmap. the reads missing 5′ exons and the singleton reads not supported by rna-seq data were not considered further. these criteria were also applied in previous pacbio transcriptome studies . with this filtering step,  <dig>  flnc reads were excluded from further analysis. the remaining  <dig>  reads were regarded as having high-quality nucleotide sequence suitable for more detailed analysis. of the  <dig>  reads,  <dig>  were assigned to  <dig>  extant loci, and  <dig> were mapped to  <dig> contig regions that did not have prior annotated gene models . the new loci defined by the  <dig> reads amounted to  <dig> . of these newly identified loci,  <dig> were located on the contigs with other gene models, and  <dig> were on the contigs that did not have any previously annotated gene models . when compared to the genes in go, kegg, kog and nr databases,  <dig> of the  <dig> new loci  could be annotated . together, the  <dig>  reads were mapped to  <dig>  loci distributed on  <dig> common wheat chromosomes . the percentages of mapped flnc reads and loci varied among the  <dig> chromosomal arms . the distribution of the  <dig> new loci also differed among the  <dig> chromosomal arms, with more of them tending to be found on the long arms of subgenome b chromosomes . among the  <dig>  loci, the majority  were covered by  <dig> to  <dig> flnc reads, while the rest  were each supported by ≥  <dig> reads. there were  <dig> loci each covered by higher than  <dig> reads.table  <dig> genomic loci and unique transcripts represented by  <dig>  high-quality flnc reads

fig.  <dig> chromosomal distributions of  <dig>  high-quality flnc reads and the loci identified by them. the known and new loci identified by the  <dig>  reads were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the three values were used as backgrounds for calculating the percentages displayed along each short arm  and long arm 



unique transcripts represented by the cdna inserts of  <dig>  high-quality flnc reads, including different isoforms for multi-exon genes, were examined. in this study, we defined the transcript isoforms of a multi-exon gene as having at least one different intron/exon junction. a total of  <dig>  unique transcripts were identified, including  <dig>  transcribed from previously annotated loci and  <dig> from the loci newly annotated by this work . of the  <dig>  transcripts corresponding to known loci,  <dig>  confirmed previous annotations, whereas  <dig> were newly discovered by this work . consequently, the total number of newly discovered transcripts by this work was  <dig> . the size of the  <dig> transcripts varied from  <dig> to 4537 bp, with the mean being 2433 bp. for comparison, we calculated the size range and average length of previously reported transcripts for the  <dig>  existing loci, which was 671–4636 bp with an average of 2388 bp. thus, on average, the newly discovered transcripts were 45 bp longer than previously reported common wheat transcripts. the  <dig>  transcripts identified based on our pacbio sequencing and their corresponding genomic loci and representative flnc reads are listed in additional file  <dig> 

interestingly, we found  <dig> transcripts  each spanning two or three different genes annotated by cs draft genome sequence . these transcripts carried intact orf capable of encoding the polypeptides with  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids . one possible explanation for this observation was that the loci transcribing the  <dig> transcripts were incorrectly annotated into separate genes in cs draft genome sequence. to investigate this possibility, the  <dig> transcripts were mapped against the genome of b. distachyon and rice. the mapping results showed that  <dig> such transcripts were reliably mapped to discrete genomic locations each with a single gene annotation in b. distachyon  . twenty-eight of these transcripts could be aligned to distinct rice loci , all of which had one annotated gene .fig.  <dig> analysis of representative transcripts spanning two or three chinese spring  loci. a the transcript 2bs_ <dig> . <dig> and the three cs loci  it covered. these loci are located on the cs contig 2bs_ <dig>  and the transcripts annotated for the three loci by the draft genome sequence are boxed in green. the bottom panel shows b. distachyon genomic region orthologous to 2bs_ <dig>  a single locus  and a corresponding transcript  are annotated for this b. distachyon genomic region . b the pacbio transcript 1al_ <dig> . <dig> and the two cs loci  it covered. the two loci reside on the cs contig 1al_ <dig>  and the representative transcripts annotated for them by the draft genome sequence are boxed in green. the bottom panel is the rice genomic region orthologous to 1al_ <dig>  a single locus  and a corresponding transcript  are annotated for this rice genomic region . the transcripts in  are all shown as smms with exon  and intron  depicted. the diagrams are not scaled



investigation of the genes differentially expressed during caryopsis development
to promote use of the transcripts identified by our pacbio sequencing for studying wheat caryopsis development in further research, we conducted the following lines of analysis. first, we computed the number of expressed genes, and the sum of expressed genes with coverage by pacbio sequencing identified transcripts, in the unfertilized caryopses and the developing grains at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> daa . the genes expressed at the four stages , as identified using the uniquely mapped illumina transcriptomic reads, amounted to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . these numbers were comparable to those reported for cs developing grains by a previous study  <cit> . at s <dig> to s <dig>  the expressed genes with coverage by the transcripts identified through pacbio sequencing were  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, with the total number of such transcripts detected at the four stages being  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  .table  <dig> estimation of the genes expressed in unfertilized caryopses and developing grains

second, we found  <dig> genes showing differential expression of the transcripts identified by our pacbio sequencing among s <dig> to s <dig> . of these genes,  <dig> had only a single form of transcript detected, and  <dig> had two or more transcript isoforms. two genes, traes_1ds_114c78bf <dig>  and traes_2bs_ cde410a7d  were chosen as representatives to test if the differential expression computed may be verified by rt-pcr. two different transcript isoforms  were identified for traes_1ds_114c78bf <dig>  with both present from s <dig> to s <dig> but only isoform b at s <dig> . consistent with this finding, rt-pcr analysis using specific primers confirmed the presence of both isoforms from s <dig> to s <dig> but only isoform b at s <dig> . the two transcript isoforms  of traes_2bs_cde410a7d were both detected at s <dig>  with only one isoform found at s <dig> and s <dig> and no isoform expressed at s <dig> . this differentially regulated isoform expression pattern was also confirmed by rt-pcr .fig.  <dig> analysis of the two different transcript isoforms of traes_1ds_114c78bf <dig> by rt-pcr. a a diagram showing the exon -intron  patterns of the two isoforms . arrows mark the positions of the primers  used for specifically amplifying each of the two isoforms. the length of the amplicon  is indicated for each isoform. b the result of amplifying isoforms a and b by rt-pcr in the caryopsis samples of four developmental stages . amplification of the common wheat actin gene  served as internal control for normalizing cdna content prior to pcr amplification. s <dig>  unfertilized caryopses; s2-s <dig>  developing grains collected at  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> daa. the data displayed are typical of three independent experiments



finding of full-length transcripts for wheat gluten gene members
to test utility of the  <dig>  flnc reads, we used this resource to search full-length transcripts for the genes encoding three families of gluten proteins, i.e., hmw-gss, lmw-gss and gliadins . a common characteristic of the three gluten gene families is the presence of multiple homoeologous and paralogous copies with high sequence similarity  <cit> , and hence the construction of full-length transcripts for these genes using short sgs reads is prone to misassembly. in our test variety xiaoyan  <dig>  there are three homoeologous loci  carrying six closely related, single-exon hmw-gs genes, including five active members  and one pseudogene   <cit> . the a, b and d copies are homoeologs whereas the x and y members are paralogs. in our search, we detected  <dig> flnc reads carrying complete hmw-gs orf, and their corresponded well to six different full-length hmw-gs transcripts . the 1ay alleles in common wheat and related species are highly similar, and have often been found to carry premature stop codon in the coding region  <cit> . consistent with the past observation, we noticed that the 1ay transcript sequence of xiaoyan  <dig> was more than 99 % identical to two previously reported inactive 1ay alleles, and that the three alleles all carried a premature stop codon at the same position of the coding region . the genes encoding lmw-gss in common wheat come from three large homoeologous loci   <cit> . the number of lmw-gs genes in xiaoyan  <dig> is still unknown, but its parental variety  has been found to carry  <dig> such genes  by a combined genomic and proteomic analysis  <cit> . here, we found  <dig> flnc reads carrying complete lmw-gs orf, and they represented  <dig> distinct full-length lmw-gs transcripts .

the genes encoding common wheat gliadins, contained mainly in two sets of compound homoeologous loci , are exceedingly complex, and have been divided into three main subfamilies according to their protein products   <cit> . however, the exact numbers of genes coding for α/β-, γ- and ω-gliadins are still unclear in common wheat. here, we detected  <dig> flnc reads harboring complete α/β-gliadin gene orf, and they identified  <dig> unique full-length transcripts for α/β-gliadins . a total of  <dig> flnc reads carrying complete γ-gliadin gene orf were detected, and they represented  <dig> distinct full-length transcripts for γ-gliadins . this finding agreed with the previous annotation of  <dig> γ-gliadin coding genes for cs  <cit> . lastly,  <dig> flnc reads carrying complete ω-gliadin gene orf were scored, and they corresponded to six different full-length transcripts for ω-gliadins, four of which had intact orf . the finding of six unique full-length transcripts for ω-gliadins here was consistent with the identification of five to seven ω-gliadin proteins in the grains of american and british common wheat cultivars  <cit> . in total, we found  <dig> non-redundant full-length transcripts for hmw-gss, lmw-gss and gliadins . the total positive flnc reads found in this search were  <dig>   <dig> of which contained complete orf . thus, the proportion of flnc reads with complete gluten gene orf was thus  <dig>  %.

discussion
in this work, we applied pacbio sequencing to investigate transcripts in the unfertilized caryopses and developing grains of common wheat. following the latest methodologies in analyzing pacbio transcriptome data , we obtained  <dig>  error corrected flnc reads,  <dig>  of which were found to be of high-quality. the new resource and transcriptional information gathered and their values for improving common wheat draft genome annotation and grain transcriptome research are discussed below.

utility of pacbio transcriptome sequencing for obtaining full-length transcript sequence information in plants
full-length transcript sequence information is very useful for both genome annotation and gene function studies in plants. however, it is often difficult to obtain such information efficiently using traditional cdna cloning and sequencing approaches . here we suggest that pacbio sequencing is an effective route for obtaining reliable full-length transcript sequence information in plants, particularly for the polyploid species like common wheat. this suggestion is supported by the following evidence. first, about  <dig>  % of the flnc reads generated in this work were found to carry complete orf when compared to several thousands of full-length cdnas published previously. second, by searching the  <dig>  flnc reads, we identified full-length transcripts for  <dig> transcribed gluten gene members belonging to three complex gene families, and the proportion of flnc reads with complete gluten gene orf was  <dig>  %. third, our pacbio sequencing correctly captured the transcripts derived from a number of pseudogenes, such as 1ay, glu-d3- <dig> and the inactive gliadin gene members . the sequencing of rt-pcr amplicons using pacbio platform by a previous study had also identified the transcripts from a number of gluten pseudogenes  <cit> . together, these data provide good support for the reliability of the full-length nucleotide sequence information obtained through pacbio transcriptome sequencing. the self-correction through subread comparison and the additional correction using hiseq transcriptomic reads have both contributed to yielding reliable nucleotide sequence data in pacbio sequencing. finally, the construction of pacbio ccss and flnc reads completely avoided the need to assemble short transcriptomic reads. this advantage has enabled us to obtain and differentiate the full-length transcripts of three families of gluten genes with highly similar homoeologous and paralogues members . because the expression of homoeologous gene set with nearly identical gene members is a fundamental characteristic of polyploid plants, pacbio sequencing should be particularly valuable for transcriptome studies of these species.

the high capacity of pacbio transcriptome sequencing to generate full-length transcript sequence information may well be related to its long-read property. in agreement with this reasoning, we found that the  <dig> newly discovered transcripts by our pacbio sequencing were on average more than 45 bp longer than the known transcripts of  <dig>  existent loci. previous transcriptome studies have also reported that pacbio sequencing represented an efficient strategy for identifying full-length and relatively long transcript sequences in human cells .

improvements on common wheat draft genome annotation
the large and complex hexaploid genome makes it difficult to develop a complete and high-quality reference genome sequence for common wheat in a short time. the available draft genome sequence of cs represents an important aid to common wheat structural and functional genomics investigations  <cit> , and continuous refinement of the draft sequence with transcriptome data should enhance its utility. in this work, we annotated  <dig> new chromosomal loci in the draft genome contigs based on newly gathered transcript evidence . more than  <dig>  % of the newly annotated genes had homologs in various databases, and thus represent a useful addition to the gene complement of the draft genome sequence. we found  <dig> new transcripts , which not only enrich the transcriptional information of the draft genome sequence but also are useful for functional studies of important genes in further research . two other sets of data with direct implications for future revision of the draft genome sequence are 1) the finding of 290 g <dig> flnc reads each mapped to two draft genome contigs from the same chromosome arm  the observation of  <dig> transcripts each spanning two or three previously annotated gene models . the  <dig> flnc reads should be useful for refining chromosomal contig assembly, whereas the  <dig> transcripts can assist more detailed annotations of the concerned chromosomal loci.

in addition to the improvements discussed above, the  <dig>  g <dig> flnc reads with three patterns of multiple genome mapping  are potentially useful for annotating highly similar homoeologous or paralogous genes of common wheat. the flnc reads in g <dig> and g <dig> may aid future annotation of the chromosomal loci not covered by the current draft genome sequence. there is also a possibility that some of the flnc reads in g <dig> and g <dig> may come from divergent variety-specific genes since the elite common wheat variety used here  may differ from the land race cs used for constructing the draft genome sequence. these variety-specific genes may help genetic analysis of the traits unique to xiaoyan  <dig> in the future.

an interesting observation in this work was that subgenome b seemed to host more of the  <dig> newly annotated loci than subgenomes a and d . this may be related to the fact that the chromosomes of subgenome b are generally larger in size than those of a and d subgenomes in common wheat  <cit> .

implications for further studies on common wheat grain transcriptome
several past studies have investigated common wheat transcriptome using hiseq technology, with substantial insights gained into the number of genes expressed, potential existence of subgenome dominance, and major biological processes operated in the developing grains  <cit> . compared to previous studies, our work is unique in using pacbio sequencing to characterize the transcripts in the unfertilized caryopses and developing grains. the newly found chromosomal loci and transcripts, as outlined and discussed above, will contribute positively to further studies on common wheat grain transcriptome. also valuable is the list of the  <dig> genes showing differentially regulated transcriptional pattern during caryopsis development, because many of them have functionally important homologs in model plants . moreover, we demonstrated that the differentially regulated isoform expression pattern computed for these genes could be verified using two representatives . therefore, the  <dig> genes might provide some useful clue for studying the involvement of alternative splicing in regulating common wheat grain development. however, we acknowledge that the identification of this set of differentially expressed genes is preliminary because the transcripts yielded by our pacbio sequencing are limited in number, and the differentially expressed transcripts were judged based on only their presence or absence at the four developmental stages. a detailed identification of the differentially expressed genes based on statistical comparison of their transcript levels at different wheat grain developmental stages is an important target for our future study.

the finding of full-length transcript sequence information for  <dig> transcribed gluten gene members should be of practical value for more systematically dissecting and improving the function of gluten proteins in common wheat. of special interest is the identification of full-length transcripts for  <dig> gliadin gene members, since they are involved in controlling both the processing and nutritional qualities of common wheat, and yet the expression and function of individual gliadin proteins remain poorly understood  <cit> . with the available full-length transcript information, it is now possible to conduct a detailed proteogenomic analysis to accurately establish the correspondence between gliadin proteins and their coding genes. the resultant data should speed up the identification of functionally important gliadin members, thus aiding the enhancement of common wheat end-use and nutritional qualities through appropriate molecular breeding strategies.

CONCLUSIONS
the data described and discussed above suggest that our pacbio transcript sequencing has generated novel resource and information with positive implications for common wheat genome annotation and gene function research. clearly, pacbio transcript sequencing can facilitate the annotation and functional studies of complex plant genomes. our study, together with those published previously , may help to stimulate more intensive application of pacbio sequencing in plant transcriptome research.
