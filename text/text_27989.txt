BACKGROUND
community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  lineage st1- sccmec iv was first reported in the 1980s among aborigines in australia  and in the usa  where cases of fatal infections were reported in michigan, minnesota and north dakota  <cit> . nowadays, ca-mrsa infections have been described in different countries involving a number of genetically distinct lineages  <cit> .

many ca-mrsa isolates  carry luksf encoding for panton-valentine leukocidin . despite the controversy regarding the role of the pvl, this leukocidin has been linked to severe skin infections and necrotizing pneumonia  <cit> . in the usa, usa <dig> has replaced usa <dig> as the predominant clone in many communities  <cit> . however, usa <dig> isolates were the main cause of an outbreak of skin infections that occurred in rural southwestern alaska, in 1996– <dig>  <cit> . indeed, usa <dig> was the far most common ca-mrsa clone recovered from three northern remote communities of saskatchewan, canada  <cit> . in  <dig>  a novel variant of the lineage st1-sccmeciv emerged in rio de janeiro city as an important cause of bloodstream infections   <cit> . it is intriguing that despite the genetic relationship with australian wa- <dig> and mw2/usa <dig>  isolates of this novel clone were pvl-negative, multiresistant and mostly involved in hospital-associated bsi  <cit> . it is still poorly understood why isolates of ca-mrsa have become successful so quickly  <cit> . nevertheless, for hospital-associated mrsa , the bacterial ability to produce biofilm has been recognized as an important virulence factor for the pathogenesis of intravenous catheter-related bacteremia and infections associated with the use of medical prosthesis. in addition, the bacterial ability to adhere to, colonize and invade host tissues is considered important factor associated with bacterial virulence, adaptation and spread  <cit> . different surface proteins have been implicated in biofilm formation/accumulation and host colonization, including fibronectin-binding proteins a and b , s. aureus surface protein g  and staphylococcal protein a   <cit> . in addition, extracellular dna  has also been associated with bacterial biofilms  <cit> .

it is also well known that virulence in s. aureus is modulated by an intricate regulatory network  <cit> . the accessory gene regulator , the major s. aureus quorum sensing system, down-regulates a number of genes encoding for cell-surface proteins involved in colonization processes, and up-regulates  different exoproteins associated with host-cell damages  <cit> . previous works have suggested that inactivation of agr could be very effective at inhibiting s. aureus infections  <cit> , including those associated with implantable medical devices  <cit> . studies have demonstrated that biofilm production, host cell adhesion and invasion as well as other mechanisms involved in the establishment and course of staphylococcal diseases were affected by knockout of the agr locus  <cit> . despite the improvements achieved in staphylococcal virulence, most of the investigations have been carried out using relatively few laboratory constructions or clinical isolates  <cit> . in addition, those results have not been validated using current clinical isolates of mrsa. in this paper we characterized the biofilm formed by usa400-related  mrsa emergent in rio de janeiro, investigated the adhesive and invasive properties of naturally agr-dysfunctional isolates and analyzed the impact of the agr inhibition on s. aureus infections associated with the use of medical device. our results suggest that strategies based on agr inactivation approaches may not be effective as an anti-biofilm strategy in the management of device-associated infections caused by these mrsa isolates.

RESULTS
biofilm
all sixty st <dig> isolates tested were able to produce biofilm on inert surfaces. the majority  exhibited a moderate  or strong  biofilm phenotypes . for  <dig> randomly selected isolates, the ability to accumulate biofilm on human fn-coated surfaces increased significantly  when compared with that on inert surfaces .

proteinaceous nature of the biofilm
treatment with proteinase k virtually disrupted preformed biofilms for  <dig> st <dig> isolates tested. however, the carbohydrate oxidant metaperiodate almost did not affect the biofilm accumulated by these isolates . clsm studies revealed that the agr-dysfunctional 08– <dig> accumulated a denser and compact biofilm when compared to the heterogeneous film formed by the agr-functional isolate . despite the stronger biofilm phenotype displayed by the isolate 08– <dig>  proteinase k could significantly remove the biological film accumulated .

role of edna in st <dig> biofilm
no correlation was detected between the activity of bacterial dnase and the levels of biofilm accumulated by  <dig> usa400-related isolates displaying strong, moderate or weak biofilm phenotypes . the addition of 28u/well dnase i in the culture media did not significantly affect the biofilm formed by these st <dig> isolates. however, when this concentration was increased to 56u/well, a significant  reduction of 31% in biofilm accumulation was detected . in addition, the concentration of edna recovered from the supernatant of the strong biofilm producer  isolate 08– <dig> was  <dig> ng/ml, three-times higher than that determined for the weaker producer  isolate 117/ <dig> . in agreement with these results, we have also detected a moderate correlation  between bacterial autolysis and biofilm accumulation, when  <dig> stronger biofilm producers were compared with the same number of weaker producers .

agrrnaiii inhibition
about 13%  of the usa <dig> related isolates exhibited no apparent hemolytic activity . these  <dig> isolates had almost undetectable agr expression by rt-qpcr . of significance is the fact that  <dig> out of  <dig> agr-dysfunctional mrsa were recovered from bsi . the rnaiii transcriptional levels for the  <dig> agr-functional isolates analyzed were significantly lower than that of strain rn6390b . when we correlated the biofilm values  with the levels of rnaiii transcription, we found that the population of clinical isolates with no hemolytic activity showed significant increase  in biofilm formation/accumulation . no significant difference could be detected in the values of oxacillin mic when agr-functional  were compared with agr-dysfunctional isolates . indeed, when we quantified meca transcripts for  <dig> st <dig> isolates, 08– <dig> , 89/ <dig> , 08– <dig> , 07– <dig> , 07– <dig> , displaying different levels of agr expression , we could not find a negative linear correlation between meca and agr expressions . thus, an overexpression of meca can not to be implicated in the inhibition of rnaiii transcription. because agr is positively regulated by sara, the expression of sara gene was also analyzed by rt-qpcr. our data showed a significant  attenuation of sara for the agr-dysfunctional isolate 08– <dig> when compared with the agr-functional 96/ <dig> .

animal model
the naturally agr-dysfunctional mrsa was able to colonize and grow on the surface of implanted catheter fragment, as well as to accumulate an increased amount of biofilm  when compared with the agr-functional isolate . the stability of the agr expression in the agr-dysfunctional mrsa was examined by observing the hemolytic activity of individual colonies. no hemolytic halo was detected before and after passages in mice .

expression of agr-regulated genes
total rna obtained from isolates with significant differences  in the rnaiii transcription level  was used to analyze the expression of genes that are well known to be regulated by agr. as expected, the agr-up-regulated hla was less expressed  in the isolate 08– <dig>  when compared with the isolate 96/ <dig> . similar pattern of expression was found for another agr-up-regulated gene, psmα , except that in this case we also observed a very high expression of psmα for 96/ <dig> . to verify if this amplified expression was a characteristic of this mrsa clone, other agr-functional isolates were randomly selected for testing. high level of psmα transcripts was also detected for the isolates 07– <dig>  07– <dig> and 08– <dig> . for all virulence genes tested, the expression of the agr-functional isolate bmb <dig> was higher than that of usa400-related isolates, except for psmα gene . accordingly, the rnaiii-down-regulated spa gene showed a very significant lower expression  in the agr-functional 96/ <dig>  compared with the agr-dysfunctional isolate 08– <dig> .

expression of biofilm-associated genes fnbab, sasg and spa
the agr-dysfunctional isolate 08– <dig>  which showed increased biofilm accumulation in vitro and in vivo, had a significant increase  in fnba transcripts  when compared with the isolate 96/ <dig> rqfnba= <dig> ± <dig> ; figure 8). however, no significant difference was detected when fnbb expression were analyzed . similarly to fnba, the expression of sasg  and spa  was also increased in 08– <dig>  compared with 96/ <dig> isolate .

adherence and invasion
the naturally agr-dysfunctional isolate 08– <dig> showed significant increase  in the adherence to human airway cells, reaching  <dig> %± <dig> % at 3h30min of incubation. in contrast, at the same conditions, the adherence of the agr-functional  to airway cells occurred in much less extent . similarly, invasion was also higher for the agr-dysfunctional isolate  when compared with the agr-functional  at 3h30min incubation . likewise, an increased invasive ability in the stationary phase was observed for the agr-knockout mhc <dig>  when compared with the wild type  and complemented construction cmhc <dig> .

discussion
the great majority of the usa400-related isolates  were able to accumulate strong/moderate biofilms on polystyrene surfaces. the isolates remaining produced weak biofilms. the ability to accumulate biofilm increased when the surfaces were covered with human fibronectin, as also reported by others  <cit> . in opposition to our results, it was reported that mw <dig> mrsa had a weak biofilm phenotype  <cit> . similarly, a slight biofilm accumulation  was observed for another usa <dig> strain called baa- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, recent data from our laboratory  showed that another sccmeciv isolates  accumulated much lower amount of biofilm compared with st1-sccmeciv isolates.

previous data from our group  <cit>  have also demonstrated that the st <dig> isolates from rio de janeiro do not carry luksf genes and have acquired a number of antimicrobial resistance traits. thus, it is possible that the enhanced ability to accumulate biofilm, associated with the biological cost of acquired resistance and the absence of pvl, might have been the results  of the microevolutionary events that accounted for changes in a previously community pathogen, promoting enhanced bacterial fitness to spread in hospitals and cause health-care associated diseases. the ica-independent nature of the biofilm formed by usa 400-related isolates was revealed by the disruption of bacterial film by proteinase k. similar results were also observed by others using different mrsa isolates  <cit> . some researchers have suggested that the bacterial autolysis increases edna concentration and, consequently, enhances the level of biofilm accumulation  <cit> . in fact, in our study, we observed a moderate correlation between biofilm accumulation and autolysis. in addition, we detected threefold increase in edna for the st <dig> mrsa displaying enhanced ability to accumulate biofilm. indeed, the addition of dnase i  caused a significant reduction  in biofilm accumulation, suggesting edna cooperatively contributes to the biofilm architecture of st <dig> isolates.

the statistical analysis showed that the group of clinical isolates with no hemolytic activity  had significant increase in the level of biofilm accumulation when compared with agr-functional isolates. these data are in agreement with previous studies for agr-laboratory knockouts  <cit> , which have indicated that some agr mutants can display increased levels of biofilm accumulation. in spite of that, using another s. aureus strain it was reported that inhibition of agr reduced biofilm accumulation significantly  <cit> . in fact, agrrnaiii is a negative regulator of different surface proteins  <cit> , and consistent with this regulation, amplified expression of genes encoding for biofilm-associated proteins fnbpa, sasg and spa was found for the agr-dysfunctional variant. both fnbpa and b have been implicated as major proteins for biofilm formation/accumulation in s. aureus <cit> . however, despite the detection of an enhanced expression of fnba, we could not find a significant increase in the transcription of fnbb-mrna for the agr-dysfunctional st1-mrsa. equally, a study from wolz and collaborators suggested that fnbb was not significantly affected by agr <cit> .

confirming the agr inhibition detected, the expression of two genes up-regulated by rnaiii, hla and psmα, was lower compared with the agr-functional mrsa. both cytolysins  seem to have remarkable roles in the pathogenesis of s. aureus. hla has been associated with lethal pneumonia in usa <dig> and usa <dig> strains  <cit> . it was also previously found that psmα-deleted mutant of ca-mrsa exhibited attenuated virulence in animal models  <cit> . in this study, we detected a superior expression of pmsα by the agr-functional isolates of usa400-related clone detected in rio de janeiro. in fact, it was shown by others that the transcription of psmα-mrna was increased in most prevalent ca-mrsa lineages, including mw <dig>  compared with other s. aureus isolates  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms involved with the enhanced expression of psmα were not clarified  <cit> . despite the importance of these virulence factors for s. aureus pathogenicity, it is remarkable that among the agr-dysfunctional variants,  <dig> were recovered from cases of bsi,  <dig> from colonization,  <dig> from pneumonia and  <dig> from infected prosthesis, showing that these variants were able to colonize and cause both severe acute  and chronic  staphylococcal diseases in humans. these data demonstrated that regardless the reduced virulence of agr-laboratory knockouts in some animal models  <cit> , the virulence of naturally dysfunctional agr variants was confirmed for hospitalized patients. in contrast to the assumption that agr-dysfunctional isolates may not be able to initiate infections  <cit> , the isolate 08– <dig> was able to colonize polyurethane endovenous catheter in a foreign-body mouse model, forming a denser biofilm accumulation when compared with the agr-functional isolate. it is important to state that because the st <dig> isolates studied were not isogenic, it is possible that factors other than the inhibition of agr might also have accounted for the increased biofilm accumulation observed. nevertheless, supporting our data, similar increase of the biofilm formed on catheters implanted in mice was previously reported for an agr laboratory knockout  <cit> . in opposition to the results obtained by traber et al.  <cit> , all individual colonies formed by the agr-dysfunctional mrsa remained non-hemolytic before and after passages in mice, strongly suggesting the genetic stability of the phenotype. this stability was confirmed for all agr-dysfunctional isolates from our collection. corroborating our findings, while we were finishing this manuscript, we noticed the work by park et al.  <cit>  that found agr dysfunction in s. aureus significantly associated with persistent bacteremia with eradicated foci, even though the predominant mrsa isolates showed sccmecii, agrii  while the isolates studied here displayed sccmeciv, agriii and clustered in usa400-mw2/wa- <dig> clone. in fact, the bacterial ability to adhere to and invade epithelial cells, and consequently evade host defense mechanisms, has already been associated with persistence in host cells and development of disseminated infections  <cit> . in the present study, the differential expression of agrrnaiii in mrsa clinical isolates had a significant impact on adherence and invasion at 3h30min incubation. the same impact was observed for the agr isogenic knockout, as previously showed by others using different cell lines and mostly laboratory mutants  <cit> .

recently, pozzi et al. demonstrated that high level of pbp2a expression by the homogeneous methicillin-resistant derivative of the strain 8325– <dig> induced a proteinaceous biofilm and significant repression of the agr locus  <cit> . in addition, excision of the sccmec element from the mrsa strain bh1cc, with consequent loss of oxacillin resistance, had the opposite effect on biofilm and lead to an increase of the agrrnaiii transcription. in addition, rudkin et al. showed that methicillin resistance reduced the virulence of ha-mrsa by interfering with agr <cit> . the great majority of st <dig> isolates studied had mic of  <dig> µg/ml , which is compatible with heterogeneous resistance to this drug. indeed, meca overexpression was not detected in the agr-dysfunctional isolates tested. sara, a global transcriptional regulator of s. aureus, was previously found to be a positive regulator of agr and of biofilm formation/accumulation  <cit> . thus, aiming to understand the mechanism involved in agr impairment in these clinical isolates, the level of sara transcripts was also examined. it was observed that sara expression was significantly diminished in the agr-dysfunctional compared with the agr-functional mrsa, suggesting the defect was upstream agr. beeken et al. indicated that sara repression inhibited biofilm accumulation due to sara inhibition of both proteases and nucleases activity either in the presence or absence of agr mutations  <cit> . in contrast, the results obtained here demonstrated that agr-dysfunctional isolates showed increased biofilm accumulation, despite the fact that sara-mrna transcripts were reduced. in fact, other studies have showed that sara or agr-sara laboratory mutants had lower ability to bind to fibronectin due to sara down-regulation of fnba transcription  <cit> . possible explanations for this apparent divergence could be the fact that the agr-dysfunctional st <dig> studied showed only partial sara inhibition, or may display strain-dependent variation in the genetic background affecting other genes apart to those studied.

CONCLUSIONS
isolates of this novel hospital-associated usa <dig> clone were able to accumulate moderate/strong amount of biofilms, in vitro and in vivo, and could efficiently adhere to and invade human airway cells. moreover, agr inhibition was an ordinary phenomenon among those isolates, which seems to have impacted the expression of some important virulence genes studied. although it is difficult to interpret in vitro studies in the light of what occurs in an infected human host, it follows logical that the enhanced adhesive properties combined with the acquisition of multiple drug resistance traits by st <dig> isolates could have provided fitness advantages for spreading in hospital environments. indeed, agr-dysfunctional isolates were recovered from cases of hospital pneumonia, bacteremia and infected prosthesis. finally, our results strongly suggest that strategies for controlling mrsa biofilm based on agr inhibition approaches are unlikely to be effective, at least for st <dig> mrsa isolates.
