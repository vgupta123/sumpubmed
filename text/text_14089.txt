BACKGROUND
spring viraemia of carp virus , the causative agent of spring viraemia of carp , is classified as a member of the family rhabdoviridae and belongs to the genus vesiculovirus. svc is an important disease affecting cyprinids, primarily common carp . this high-mortality disease is endemic in europe, north america, and parts of asia  <cit> . the major clinical signs for svcv infection include ascites, and petechiae and ecchymoses in the gills and skin  <cit> .

svcv exhibits the typical bullet-shaped morphology of a vertebrate rhabdovirus. its genome is a linear single-stranded, negative-sense rna that is approximately  <dig> kb in length and encodes five structural proteins: nucleoprotein , phosphoprotein , matrix protein , glycoprotein , and rna-dependent polymerase   <cit> .

there have been several studies concerning the pathogenic mechanism  involved in svcv infection have been reported . our previous work demonstrated that the expression of heme oxygenase  <dig>  was down-regulated during svcv infection in vivo, which suggested that svcv infection could induce host oxidative stress that might contribute to tissue injury  <cit> . high-throughput methods, including pathway-targeted microarrays and proteomic analysis, have also been used to scan the host response to viral infection  <cit> . these studies suggest that apoptosis, oxidative stress and the interferon  system may contribute to the mechanisms of the viral pathogenesis. however, a comprehensive identification of the genes involved in viral pathogenesis as well as major signal transduction pathways and intracellular interaction networks remains unavailable. ultrahigh-throughput sequencing technologies permit genome-wide transcriptome analysis at high resolution, and these technologies have been widely used to study pathogenic processes during virus infection, including infections by aquatic viruses  <cit> .

new evidence has suggested that the current lineages of the epithelioma papulosum cyprinid  cell line originated from the fathead minnow   <cit> . the temperature growth range, good splitting ratio  and virus susceptibility make epc cells highly suitable both for fish pathology and comparative virology studies. the fathead minnow, a species of temperate freshwater fish belonging to the cyprinid family, is widely used as an indicator of environmental water monitoring in ecotoxicological research  <cit> . however, only sporadic genetic information about epc cells or the fathead minnow is available, which might limit further studies with these resources.

in the present study, we present the results from sequencing and assembly of the transcriptome of epc cells at progressive times after svcv infection. genes involved in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and the ifn system as well as nearly all major conserved metazoan signal transduction pathways were largely identified in the epc transcriptome. it is the first light upon this well known and used fish cell line in fish virology. additionally, a great number of genes that were differentially expressed upon svcv infection were obtained and functionally annotated. the gene expression patterns for some of these genes were verified by rt-qpcr. these results offer insight into the complexity of the virus–cell interactions, and add new information that may help to control svcv infection.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequence assembly and analysis
to obtain an overview of the transcriptome of the epc cells, cdna samples from normal epc cells and from epc cells at different stages during svcv infection were mixed and sequenced on an illumina machine. a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean data from  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads, with a mean read length  <dig> bp, was obtained. these raw data were assembled into  <dig>  contigs. the mean contig size was  <dig> bp, with lengths ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp. the contig size distribution is shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

differentially expressed genes
to identify differentially expressed genes  that potentially are involved in svcv infection, cdna libraries were constructed from pooled mrnas extracted from the svcv- infected epc cells  and non-infected groups. subsequently, these libraries were sequenced on a genome analyzer ii. degs were obtained based on the rpkm of the genes either in svcv-infection or non-infection group. a gene with an rpkm ratio larger than  <dig> or smaller than  <dig>  was considered to be a deg  <cit> . for the svcv transcriptome, all five genes encoded by the svcv genome, including n, p, m, g and l, were transcribed in epc cells during the entire infection course, though the m and l gene were decreased at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post infection. the statistics of degs of host cells between different groups is shown in table  <dig>  altogether,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in epc cells at  <dig> h post svcv infection  compared to the non-infected cells, including  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes . among the up-regulated genes, the expression levels of  <dig> genes were increased more than  <dig> times, and  <dig> genes were increased more than  <dig> times. c-fos and kruppel-like factor 2a , both associated with stress response, were the genes that showed the highest up-regulation, with an increase of more than  <dig> times. among the down-regulated genes, the expression levels of  <dig> genes were decreased more than  <dig> times. the most down-regulated gene adrenomedullin  <dig> , which associated with oxidative stress, was decreased more than  <dig> times.table  <dig>

functional annotation of the degs
to understand the functions of the degs and the biological processes involved in svcv infection, all of the degs were mapped to terms in the go  and kegg databases . go analysis showed that a total of  <dig>  unigenes had go annotations. among the up-regulated genes of host cells at  <dig> h post infection,  <dig> unigenes were mapped to biological processes,  <dig> unigenes were mapped to cellular components, and  <dig> unigenes were mapped to molecular functions. of the biological process related genes, most were involved in cellular processes , regulation of biological processes, macromolecule metabolism , cell communication  and responses to stimulus . most of the cellular component related genes were involved in the cell and nucleus. most of the molecular function related genes were involved in binding , transcription regulator and transporter activity. the go analysis of the down-regulated genes at  <dig> h post infection is show in figure 5b. among these degs at  <dig> h post svcv infection, “nucleus”, “intracellular” and “chromosome” in the cellular component ontology, “regulation of biological process”, “response to stimulus” and “macromolecule metabolism” in the biological process ontology, and “protein transporter activity” and “structural molecule activity” in the molecular function ontology were enriched by p-value analysis.kegg analysis on the degs revealed that the up-regulated genes at  <dig> h post svcv infection were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . nearly 50% percent of the up-regulated degs were assigned to the top  <dig> pathways as follows: infectious diseases , cancer , signal transduction , immune system and endocrine system . additionally, the down-regulated genes were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways, including infectious diseases , cancer , signal transduction , neurodegenerative diseases , and endocrine system . altogether, the pathways involved with the degs that were enriched for the terms “cell growth and death”, “immune disease”, “infectious diseases”, “endocrine system”, “cancer”, “neurodegenerative diseases” and “signal transduction” were enriched by p value analysis.figure  <dig>

kinetics of degs at different time points post- svcv infection
compared to the non-infected epc cells, there were  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes at  <dig> h post infection . when comparing degs of host cells between the groups of  <dig> h and  <dig> h post- infection, the number of up-regulated and down-regulated genes is  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. looking at various genes, many were up-regulated at  <dig> h or  <dig> h, then decreased to the control level. this suggested that svcv infection stirred up an obvious stress reaction in the early stage of infection. for instance, interleukin-11b, involved in antibacterial and antiviral responses  <cit> , was transiently and sharply up-regulated at  <dig> h by svcv infection, and then decreased to the normal level at  <dig> h and  <dig> h. in contrast to the early stage of svcv infection, degs with modest overlaps were found and resulted in cell damage.

verification of transcriptome data by rt-qpcr
to further evaluate our deg library,  <dig> up-regulated degs and  <dig> down-regulated degs with different fold changes were randomly selected to perform rt-qpcr. among these selected degs, c-fos, c-jun, and klf2a showed the highest up-regulation in mrna sequencing method. c-jun in combination with c-fos, forms the activator protein  <dig>  early response transcription factor and is associated with stress response. the two other up-regulated genes were caspase  <dig>  and myeloid differentiation primary response  <dig> . these two genes were involved in the regulation of cell death and the innate immune response, respectively. the three selected down-regulated degs were heat shock protein  <dig> , ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, rieske iron-sulfur polypeptide  <dig> and gsna. the rt-qpcr results revealed the same expression tendency as the deg data, despite some quantitative differences in expression level . among these selected degs, the obvious quantitative differences between sequencing and qpcr methods was only observed on the expression of klf2a. taken together, qrt-pcr analysis confirmed the tendency detected by the mrna sequencing analysis.figure  <dig>

discussion
global analysis of viral susceptibility genes in epc transcriptome
the epc cell line was established in the 1970s and has become one of the most widely used tools for research on fish virus and the diagnosis of fish diseases. most of viruses causing systemic infections of fish families and amphibians, as well as indiana-type vesicular stomatitis virus can propagate in epc cells  <cit> . mining the viral susceptibility genes from the transcriptome data may shed light on the potential mechanism for the broad spectrum sensitivity of this cell line to viruses. previously, twelve independent studies were summarised to compile a list of human genes important for human immunodeficiency virus  and other virus infection  <cit> . a total of  <dig> human genes that were identified in two or more of these independent studies was suggested to be important for viral infection in mammalian cells. among these, only  <dig> homologous genes lacked detectable expression levels in the epc transcriptome . of these unexpressed genes, several were specially expressed on mammalian t cells, natural killer  cells or antigen presenting cells , including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  for instance, cd <dig> is expressed on the surface of t cells and nk cells, and cd <dig> is expressed on apc, particularly macrophages. these two adhesion molecules are vitally important for hepatitis b virus  infection. the gene expression profile of epc cells suggests that epc would be one of the best cell models for the study of virus-host interactions. this contrasts with cho-k <dig>  a preferred host cell line for the production of therapeutic proteins, which is naturally resistant to several viral infection; in cho-k <dig> there were  <dig> genes lacking detectable expression levels and  <dig> genes that were not found in its genome  <cit> . interestingly, overlaps were found among the non- expressing genes in the epc and cho-k <dig> cell lines. for example, interleukin  <dig> alpha , responsible for the production of inflammation, as well as the promotion of fever and sepsis, was not expressed in the epc and cho-k <dig> cells. another gene of interest that was not expressed in epc cells. is catalase, a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen. such information could aid an in-depth analysis of viral susceptibility genes in epc cells.

overlaps among different screens for the host responses to svcv infection
until now, two independent studies have investigated the host response to svcv infection by systematic methods  <cit> . liu et al. revealed  <dig> dynamically changed proteins in svcv-infected epc using 2-de profile and ms identification  <cit> . compared with our results presented here, a total of  <dig> genes  overlapped with similar expression profile . similarly, the overlap between our results and a study which was screened using pathway-target microarrays for zebrafish infected with and survived svcv was modest  <cit> . in that study,  <dig> multipath genes common to more than  <dig> pathways were identified in 2-day exposed or 30-day survivors of svcv infection. among these  <dig> regulated genes,  <dig> genes shared a similar expression pattern. however, variation due to 1)experimental noise, 2)timing of sampling, 3) cell type, and 4)different filtering criteria are likely to explain some of the differences among these studies.

pathophysiology of the epc response to svcv infection
i. oxidative stress in svcv infection
oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimer’s disease and parkinson’s disease  <cit> . oxidative stress occurs in cells when production of reactive oxygen species  exceeds the cell’s endogenous antioxidant defences. many dna and rna viruses can trigger oxidative stress and induce host cell death in infected cells . upon svcv infection,  <dig> genes involved in oxidative stress were regulated, including  <dig> down-regulated genes and  <dig> up-regulated genes . the down-regulated genes included several subunits of the nadh dehydrogenase  <dig> alpha complex, the first enzyme complex in the electron transport chain located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, i.e. nadh dehydrogenase  <dig> alpha subcomplex  <dig>  ndufa <dig>  ndufa <dig> and ndufa <dig>  nadh dehydrogenase fe-s protein  <dig> , ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase iron-sulphur subunit, and cytochrome b <dig> type a . cu/zn-superoxide dismutase , one of the major defences against ros, was down-regulated more than  <dig> times post svcv infection. the up-regulated genes included sestrin  <dig> , uncoupling protein  <dig>  and oxidative stress induced growth inhibitor  <dig> . sesn <dig> encodes a member of the sestrin family of stress-induced proteins and could reduces the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species  <cit> . uncoupling protein  <dig> is a member of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins and its main function is to control mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species. osgin <dig>  encoding an oxidative stress response protein, is regulated by p <dig> and is induced by dna damage. osgin <dig> also regulates apoptosis by inducing cytochrome c release from mitochondria. these regulated genes indicated that svcv infection could induce oxidative stress in epc cells resulting in a series of physiological changes. another gene of interest is catalase, a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen that is very important in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by ros; but there was no detectable expression in epc cells. altogether, host and virus factors were both contributed to the induction of oxidative stress and the consequent cell damage.table  <dig>

*fold changes refers to the changes of gene expression in response to svcv infection at the indicated time points, and the minus value means the gene is down-regulated after svcv infection; while the positive value means the gene is up-regulated in svcv-infected cells. the dashes  indicated that the expression level of certain gene is not changed at the indicated time point post svcv infection when compared with  <dig> h post svcv infection.



ii. apoptosis induced by svcv infection
programmed cell death  is one of the most common forms of cell death in multicellular organisms and it plays a pivotal role during normal development and in the regulation of various physiological processes  <cit> . two principle pathways of apoptosis exist in mammalian cells, i.e., the extrinsic or receptor-mediated pathway and the intrinsic pathway, which is mediated via mitochondrial and the endoplasmic reticulum. a previous study indicated that epc cells infected with svcv undergo apoptosis  <cit> . in agreement with those results, we found that  <dig> pro-apoptosis genes were up-regulated and  <dig> anti-apoptosis genes were down-regulated at  <dig> h post infection. most of the up-regulated genes were involved in the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway, including casp <dig>  bcl-2-binding component  <dig> , tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, epsilon polypeptide  <dig> , programmed cell death protein  <dig>  and many other genes involved in p <dig> signal transduction . casp <dig> encodes an initiator caspase that directly cleaves downstream effector caspases such as caspase- <dig> or cleavaging bid, a bcl- <dig> family protein with a bh <dig> domain to initiate a mitochondrial amplification loop  <cit> . upon svcv infection, casp <dig> was up-regulated more than  <dig> times. bbc <dig>  encoding an essential pro-apoptotic protein, was up-regulated more than  <dig> times at  <dig> h post infection. in the pathway of p <dig> dependent apoptosis, the up-regulation of bbc <dig> can induce the expression of apoptosis regulator bax and bak to trigger apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. mdm <dig>  an important negative regulator of the p <dig> tumour suppressor, was up-regulated more than  <dig> times upon svcv infection. meanwhile, several tumor necrosis factor  signal-related genes were up-regulated including tumour necrosis factor, tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1a/11a and 11b, and tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3/ <dig>  this indicated that the tnf signal was activated upon svcv infection. several genes involved in the p <dig> signal pathway were also regulated post svcv infection. taken together, svcv infection could induce apoptosis through the tnf mediated extrinsic pathway and the mitochondrial pathway. further studies are needed to reveal the detailed mechanism.

iii. regulation of the cytoskeleton by svcv infection
viruses use different elements of the cytoskeleton for entry, replication, intracellular transport and budding  <cit> . many studies have implicated microfilament, intermediate filaments, and microtubules, as well as proteins that regulate cytoskeleton functions, in the infectious cycles of viruses  <cit> . previous proteomic data revealed that svcv infection could regulate the cytoskeleton of epc cells. in our results, approximately  <dig> cytoskeleton- associated genes were down-regulated, including five microfilament-associated gene  and several microtubule-associated genes . these microtubule-associated genes were down-regulated more than  <dig> times. these genes are also associated with the functional category of cell communication. among all the regulated genes, only one cytoskeleton-related gene  was up-regulated at  <dig> h post-viral infection. in agreement with the gene expression profile, epc cells changed to a round sharp and lost the capacity to adhere at  <dig> h post-infection. previous studies have shown that influenza a virus may interact with tubulin and induce disruption of the microtubule network and apoptosis in a <dig> cells  <cit> . we speculated that svcv can also induce cytoskeletal disruption, which may be related to the release of svcv particles, as well as induce apoptosis of infected cell, but this requires further study.

iv. inhibition of the interferon system
the interferon  response is one of the most fundamental defence mechanisms against viral infection  <cit> . viruses, which require cellular machinery for their replication, have evolved different strategies to counteract the action of ifn, particularly by the alteration of ifn-signaling and ifn-induced mediators that are required for virulence  <cit> . here, four ifn-signaling genes were up-regulated and no ifn-stimulated genes  were regulated untill  <dig> h post infection with svcv. however, we could find many isgs from the transcriptome of epc cells, including mx dynamin-like gtpase  <dig> . these up-regulated genes include interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , and ifr <dig> binding protein 2-b . the products of irf <dig> and irf <dig>  interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  and interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  are structurally similar but functionally distinct transcription factors that bind to the positive regulatory domains i and iii  within the human ifn-beta promoter  <cit> . irf- <dig> serves as an activator of interferon alpha and beta transcription, while irf- <dig> competitively inhibits the irf-1-mediated transcriptional activation of interferon alpha and beta. both of irf <dig> and irf <dig> were also up-regulated more than  <dig> times. more interestingly, ifr <dig> binding protein 2-b, which can interact with the c-terminal transcriptional repression domain of irf- <dig>  was up-regulated more than  <dig> times. the product of irf <dig>  interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , has been shown to play a role in the transcriptional activation of virus-inducible cellular genes, including the type i interferon genes  <cit> . irf <dig> was also up-regulated significantly at  <dig> h post svcv infection. in summary, we speculate that svcv infection might induce the production of ifn but block the function of ifn by inhibiting the production of isgs through an unknown mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we present the data from sequencing and assembly of the transcriptome of epc cells at progressive times after svcv infection. a great number of genes that were differentially expressed upon svcv infection were obtained and functionally annotated. further, the gene expression patterns for some of these genes were verified by rt-qpcr. the data present here demonstrate previously unrecognised changes in gene transcription that are associated with svcv infection in vitro, and many potential cascades identified in the study clearly warrant further experimental investigation. our data also provide new clues to the mechanism of viral susceptibility in epc cells.
