BACKGROUND
microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats , are tandemly repeated 1–6-bp dna regions ubiquitous in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. as components of genomes, they can be found both in protein-coding and non-coding regions. ssrs have been universally utilized as genetic markers because of their abundance and inherent potential for variation  <cit> . the functions of ssrs were previously unclear, and until recently they were regarded as ‘junk’ . at present, much progress has been achieved in regard to elucidation of ssr function. ssr locations appear to determine the types of functional roles that ssrs play, and alterations in ssr lengths at different locations can lead to changes in organismal phenotypes  <cit> . ssrs in different gene positions , 3′ utrs, exons, and introns) may play important roles in determining protein function, genetic development, and regulation of gene expression. for example, expansion of cag repeats in the hd gene coding region can lead to huntington’s disease in humans, possibly through activation of some so-called ‘toxic’ proteins  <cit> . with expanding knowledge of ssr functions in terms of development, gene regulation, and evolution, ssrs are receiving increasing attention. because genomic information is lacking for most species, however, it is difficult to study microsatellite origin, distribution, and evolution, or even to develop new ssr-based molecular markers.

traditional ssr development is time-consuming, and involves laborious iterations of genomic dna library screening with ssr probes required to isolate microsatellite-containing sequences  <cit> . next-generation sequencing technologies are remarkably well-developed, and are widely used for genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and genome deep-sequencing in plants  <cit> . it has been successfully used for identifying molecular markers, including ssrs and simple nucleotide polymorphisms , in organisms such as the water strider  <cit> , copperhead snake  <cit> , blue duck  <cit> , pine pathogen fungus  <cit> , and scuttle fly  <cit> . because of the complicated structure of plant genomes, however, molecular marker development using next-generation sequencing has had limited application, especially in non-model plants lacking genomic information.

among next generation-sequencing approaches, roche  <dig> pyrosequencing  holds great promise with respect to the long reads obtained as well as acquisition of sufficient genetic information of interest within single reads. the large amount of generated data facilitates sequence assembly without genomic information  <cit> , and increases the likelihood that a single read contains microsatellite repeats along with suitable flanking regions of unique sequences. another approach to mining molecular markers, involving in silico methods, has also been successful; examples include the derivation of markers from a draft genome  <cit>  and the mining of existing expressed sequence tag  libraries  <cit> . compared with traditional library-based and in silico methods, r <dig> offers great advantages, being faster, less costly, and less dependent on existing genetic resources  <cit> . another advantage is the huge amount of genetic information produced, with the possibility of future use. this is greatly beneficial for studies of plants without genomic information, especially woody plants; in such species, no established systems exist for in vitro culture or transformation for genetic manipulation, hampering new cultivar breeding. molecular marker-assisted breeding is efficient for such organisms. dna markers developed via next-generation sequencing are also increasingly being used for genetic diagnostics, drug discovery, gene cloning, genome analysis, comparative genomics, and molecular evolution studies.

the purpose of this study was to apply next-generation sequencing, such as r <dig>  to ssr development in tree peony . such an approach was expected to drastically shorten the time required for effective marker development and utilization. tree peony belongs to sect. moutan dc. of the genus paeonia l. . it is a well-known ornamental plant enjoying worldwide popularity on account of its large, showy, colorful and fragrant flowers. little genomic information is currently available for this species. in a previous study, we constructed a cdna library from flower buds and obtained  <dig>  ests, from which  <dig> ssrs were derived and a dataset of  <dig> putative snps obtained for breeding based on their high availability and stability  <cit> . although more than  <dig> ssrs have been submitted to public databases  <cit> , the number is inadequate with respect to the  <dig>  cultivars of tree peony. compared with crop plants such as maize, wheat, and soybean, or ornamental plants such as rose, molecular markers, especially ssrs, are still needed for future breeding of tree peony. this is especially true taking into consideration its importance, barely transformed nature, and woody characteristics, and the lack of genomic information. construction of a dense genetic linkage map and development of genome-wide molecular markers are also essential for marker-assisted selection of new tree peony hybrids. because relationships among wild species of tree peony and their taxonomic position within paeoniaceae are still unclear, developed polymorphic ssrs would also aid studies of paeonia evolution, comparative genetics, and population structure.

RESULTS
sequencing and characterization of reads
r <dig> sequencing of the tree peony library generated  <dig>  reads averaging 356 bp long, with a maximum length of 590 bp . among these nucleotides, adenine was the most abundant , followed by cytosine , thymine , and guanine . g + c content was  <dig> %. clean reads were deposited in the ncbi public database .

identification of ssr loci
misa was used to analyze a total of  <dig> ,018 bp of sequences, from which  <dig>  ssrs were identified. of the examined sequences,  <dig>  contained ssrs; 27% harbored more than one ssr, with a high proportion of ssrs  present in compound formation . the distribution of identified ssr motifs in the cloned sequences was nearly evenly divided between the 400-bp 5′-terminus region and the remaining region outside the 5′-terminus . ssrs with repeat motifs of  <dig> to 4 bp  accounted for  <dig> % of the total, with di-nucleotide repeats the most abundant . ssrs with mono-nucleotide repeats accounted for only 2% of ssrs in tree peony dna. proportions of tri-nucleotide and tetra-nucleotide repeats were almost equal, with the combined number of tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide repeats accounting for at most  <dig> % of ssrs.


p. suffruticosa
data for b. distachyon, s. bicolor, o. sativa, a. thaliana, m. truncatula, and p. trichocarpa were obtained from sonah et al.  <dig> .

--: the percent was not calculated due to the genome of p. suffruticosa was unkown.

relative frequency of different ssr repeat motifs
a summary of ssrs, including repeat motif and total number of different repeat motifs, is shown in table  <dig>  of the two possible types of mono-nucleotide repeats, the most abundant was n, as in most plants; n was much less common in tree peony, accounting for only  <dig> % of total ssrs. ssr frequency decreased with increasing motif length ; most ssrs were composed of mono-, di-, tri-, or tetra- nucleotide repeats, with only a very small share contributed by penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeats. the di-nucleotide repeat n was more common than n and n. with respect to tri-nucleotide repeats, a/t-rich repeats were dominant in tree peony , with aac/gtt the most abundant tri-nucleotide motif  followed by aag/ctt . the repeats ccg and acg were less frequent or absent. the most frequent penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeat motifs were sequences containing the di-nucleotide cpg: aacgt/acgtt and aaggag/ccttct, respectively.

relative frequencies of different ssr repeat lengths
the lengths of ssrs were classified into  <dig> groups . the shortest ssrs  constituted 1% of the total. ssrs with lengths of 21– <dig> and 101–110 bp accounted for 26% and 29% of ssrs, respectively . among di-nucleotide ssrs, the most abundant repeated length was 28 bp, followed by 12 bp and then  <dig> or 14 bp. the most common length of tri-nucleotide ssrs was approximately 15 bp, with smaller numbers of 18- and 21-bp sequences. repeat lengths of tetra-nucleotide ssrs ranged from about 20–28 bp.

compound ssr analysis
about 26% of identified ssrs were compound. interruption distance ranged from 5–195 bp, with most interruptions 5–20 bp long . many of the compound ssrs were composite, being made up of various combinations of mono- to hexa-nucleotide repeats, such as n-n, n-n, n-n, n-n, or n-n. about 56% of repeat motifs were found in compound ssrs, revealing the complexity of the tree peony genome.

microsatellite distribution in different genomic regions of tree peony using arabidopsis, poplar, and grape reference sequences
the distribution of ssrs from tree peony was analyzed based on arabidopsis, grape, and poplar coding regions . many sequences  were mapped onto arabidopsis cdss, whereas only  <dig> % and  <dig> % were mapped onto cdss of grape and poplar, respectively. a large number of sequences,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, could not be mapped onto any arabidopsis, poplar, or grape genomic region. more tree peony ssrs mapped to 5′ utrs than to 3′ utrs in the above three species, while  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ssr-containing sequences were mapped to introns of arabidopsis, grape, and poplar genomes, respectively .

unlike arabidopsis, grape and poplar genomes have not been fully annotated; arabidopsis was consequently used as a reference plant for further study . most ssrs with mono-nucleotide repeats  could not be mapped, and only  <dig> % were observed in cds regions. among ssrs with di-nucleotide repeats, 44% mapped within 3′ utrs, 5′ utrs, introns, and cdss, with 27% of these found in introns. approximately 55% of ssrs with tri-nucleotide repeats mapped within cdss, while most ssrs with tetra-, penta-, or hexa-nucleotide repeats mapped onto intergenic positions, or could not be mapped onto the arabidopsis genome. with respect to c-type ssrs , 33% mapped to introns, and 9% in total were mapped onto 3′ utr, 5′ utr, or cds regions. in regard to c*-type ssrs , 27% were mapped onto introns and 26% to intergenic regions . among tree peony ssrs that were mapped to arabidopsis cds regions, those with tri-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant, followed by di-nucleotide repeat ssrs; in contrast, intergenic regions and introns contained more di-nucleotide and compound ssrs than did cds regions .

compound ssrs are designated as follows: c* = no interruption between two motifs; c = interruption between two motifs; p1–p <dig> refers to the repeat motif .

functional annotation of ssr-containing coding sequences
gene ontology  analysis was performed on sequences with ssrs mapping onto cdss. numbers of genes and go classifications are displayed in figure  <dig>  genes were classified into three major categories based on their sub-cellular function: cellular component, molecular function, and biological processes. genes with functions related to cell and cell part , macromolecular complex , and organelle  were the most abundant genes in the cellular component category. the molecular function category was rich in genes associated with binding , catalytic activity , and structural molecules . genes related to cellular process , metabolic process , and response to stimulus  were the most heavily represented in the biological process category.

validation of ssr assays
a major advantage of the approach used in this study is the ability to obtain ssrs rapidly, thus greatly reducing the time and expense required to check for polymorphisms. in this study,  <dig> primer pairs were selected for validation using three tree peony accessions , and  <dig> primer pairs with high amplification effect were subsequently used for polymorphism analysis among  <dig> accessions . the number of alleles per locus ranged from two to five; expected heterozygosity varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> , whereas observed heterozygosity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . it has been confirmed that p. rockii and p. ostii are the ancestors of all  <dig> cultivars analyzed in this study. upgma analysis of ssr data resulted in cultivars ‘yao huang’ , ‘dou lv’ , ‘shui jing bai’ , and ‘liu li guan zhu’  from the zhongyuan cultivar group clustering together, demonstrating their close genetic relationships to one another. cultivars from the japanese cultivar group—‘taiyoh’ , ‘shima nisshiki’ , and ‘gun pou den’ , derived from the zhongyuan group, clustered with this latter group. all of these cultivars formed a major branch in the upgma dendrogram . cultivars ‘huai nian’ , ‘ju yuan shao nv’ , and ‘xin xing’  from the xibei cultivar group clustered together, reflecting their close inter-relationships, and formed another branch in the upgma dendrogram . the results of cluster analysis of these ssr genotypes, consistent with known genetic relationships, are similar to results obtained using est-ssr, trap, and srap markers  <cit> , and confirm the usefulness of the ssr markers developed in this study.

discussion
the number of ssrs obtained in this study from tree peony was higher than that generated from other plants, including arabidopsis, medicago truncatula, oryza sativa , and sorghum bicolor   <cit> . the frequency of a/t repeats present in tree peony was between dicots and monocots  <cit> . the percentage of tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide repeats observed in tree peony  was higher than in sorghum , populus , medicago , rice , brachypodium , and arabidopsis   <cit> .

the frequency of di-nucleotide repeats in tree peony was not consistent with that observed in brachypodium by sonah et al.  <cit> . similar to rice, ag/ct repeats were well represented. ag/ct and at/at repeats were abundant in tree peony, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of identified ssrs, while at/at repeats were more frequent in populus  and medicago   <cit> . cg/cg repeats were relatively uncommon in tree peony, however, similar to populus, medicago, and arabidopsis, suggesting that cg-rich motifs are the least preferred in dicot genomes. in human, caenorhabditis, and arabidopsis genomes, the most common di-nucleotide repeats are n, n, and n, respectively, demonstrating that different species have different motif frequency distributions.

with respect to tri-nucleotide repeats, agc/cgt, agg/cct, and ccg/cgg have been observed more frequently in monocots than in dicots. a/t-rich repeats were the dominant tri-nucleotide ssrs in tree peony, similar to the results of sonah et al.  <cit> . in tree peony, the sparseness or absence of ccg and acg repeats may be due to highly mutable cpg di-nucleotide repeats, as evidenced in rice by the tendency of tri-nucleotide repeats, with few exceptions, to consist of various combinations of c and g. transcriptional repression by dna methylation depends on cpg density; ccg repeats may also be selected against by the requirements of the splicing machinery, with maintenance or absence of ccg possibly an active process  <cit> . the total absence of a particular repeat motif may indicate that the sequence is not preferred by the mechanism generating repeats or that strong selective pressure exists against repeated occurrence of particular sequences  <cit> .

the characteristically short lengths of ssrs may have functional implications with respect to their evolution or the genes involved in plant physiology and development. in a previous study  <cit> , rice ssrs were divided into two groups based on the length of ssr tracts and their potential as informative genetic markers: class i microsatellites contained perfect ssrs ≥ 20 bp long and class ii microsatellites contained perfect ssrs 12–20 bp long. class ii microsatellites tended to be less variable because of less possibility of slipped-strand mispairing over the shorter ssr template. in tree peony, 85% of ssrs were categorized as class i microsatellites and 1% as class ii microsatellites. longer perfect repeats  have been determined to be highly polymorphic  <cit> . in future studies of tree peony ssrs, attention should focus on class i microsatellites, with an emphasis on evaluation of polymorphism and its implications.

length variation of repeated units may be due to differences in generation and fixation mechanisms of simple repetitive dna. the inherent ability of a sequence to form alternative dna conformations may be important for ssr generation, but does not explain differences observed among taxa. enzymes or other proteins responsible for various aspects of dna processing, such as replication and repair, and for chromatin remodeling, may be involved in the taxon specificity of microsatellite characteristics. it should be emphasized that not only do genomes differ in degree of repetitiveness  <cit> , but also in preferred microsatellite types. in plant genomes, the frequent occurrence of repeat motifs of a particular sequence and length is the result of selection pressure applied on the specific motif during evolution  <cit> . the molecular mechanism responsible for the origin of microsatellites is still a subject of controversy, with many theories—such as replication slippage and unequal crossing-over—proposed to explain their occurrence  <cit> . the essential basis for species-specific accumulation of particular motif repeats, repeat lengths, and g/c content, which may influence unique microsatellite distribution patterns and evolution, is also still unclear. variations in repetition purity and motif length enable site-specific adjustment of mutation rate and mutation effect, evidence indicating that common ssr alleles may offer potential selective advantages  <cit> . the increasing number of species with sequenced genomes should provide a foundation for the study of microsatellite evolution and even lead to discovery of the genetic/genomic role of microsatellites.

ssr frequency in monocot cds regions is twice that of dicots  <cit> . it has been suggested that ssrs in different gene positions may perform varied functions. in animals, including mammals and other vertebrates, introns contain more poly  than poly  repeats. in caenorhabditis elegans, however, intergenic regions show an interesting preference for poly  over poly  repeats  <cit> , indicating that preferences may vary among organisms. in tree peony, the abundance of tri-nucleotide repeats mapping onto cds regions was consistent with results found for the six species studied by sonah et al.  <cit> . tang et al.  <cit>  examined ssrs in the arabidopsis genome, and found that ssrs generally were preferentially located in upstream gene regions, especially 5′ utrs; as in tree peony, tri-nucleotide repeats were the most common repeats found in coding regions. the accumulation of tri-nucleotide repeats in coding regions is primarily due to the triplet-repeat nature of codons  <cit> . the various numbers of repeats in coding regions are a potential source of quantitative and qualitative phenotypic variation  <cit> . ssrs in 5′ utrs and cdss may modify the expression or function of genes with which they are associated  <cit> .

in rice, 80% of gc-rich tri-nucleotide repeats occur in predicted exons, while at-rich tri-nucleotide repeats are distributed evenly across all genomic components. di-nucleotide and tetra-nucleotide repeats are predominantly situated in noncoding—mainly intergenic—regions. n repeats usually occur in regions with a balanced  gc content, favoring robust pcr amplification, whereas n and n are rare in gene-rich regions  <cit> . tri- and hexa-nucleotide repeats have been shown to be the most common repeats in eukaryotic coding regions  <cit> . in our study, ssr-containing genes encoding for binding, catalytic, and structural molecules were abundant in the go molecular function category, similar to results found in brachypodium <cit> . while such ssr-containing genes may perform multiple functions in tree peony, the importance of ssrs within genes remains to be further explored.

the ssr markers identified in this study should be useful for population genetic studies, and are potentially amplifiable across the genus. plant genomes are complex, and contain large amounts of repetitive dna, including microsatellites, which has immediate practical implications for the success of ssr marker development. observed differential patterns of ssr marker distribution may be helpful for studying microsatellite evolution in a monocot-dicot system. ssr markers developed in this study have potential application to genomic research, marker-assisted breeding, dna fingerprinting of genetic resources, molecular mapping of tree peony and related species, and map-based cloning of candidate genes. hypervariable microsatellites are a useful source of polymorphic dna markers for linking genetic maps with genomic sequences, and ultimately with phenotypic variation. they provide an opportunity to use ssr markers to investigate the wide range of genetic diversity that exists in wild relatives outside of the tree peony gene pool. because ssrs are associated with vital functions and characteristics, such as transcription factor binding, rna shape, dna structure and packaging, and dna length and orientation  <cit> , the ssrs obtained in this study may be important for investigating plant genomic structural evolution and for providing insights into phenotypic variation in species during their evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first application of next-generation sequencing for high-throughput microsatellite development in tree peony. the large size of the tree peony genome, approximately 16 g , hampers its sequencing, and the species is not highly amenable to transformation because of its woody characteristics. consequently, the  <dig>  microsatellites obtained in this study should be useful for marker-assisted breeding and functional characterization of genes related to trait formation. in addition, because the phylogenetic position of paeoniaceae is still unresolved, the uncovered microsatellites may serve as a data resource for evolutionary studies in the family.
