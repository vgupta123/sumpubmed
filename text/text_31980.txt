BACKGROUND
major classes of axon guidance molecules include the netrins, semaphorins, ephrins and slit ligands, which interact with their cognate family of receptors to orchestrate stereotypical nerve patterns in a developing vertebrate embryo  <cit> . each family has at least one member that plays a functional role in vascular development. our study focuses on the roundabout  family of axon guidance genes  <cit> . robos are cell surface transmembrane receptors that have been identified in most species to mediate repulsion-guidance mechanisms in axons  <cit> . four robo receptor genes  have been identified in mammals, and their function vary widely depending on the tissue where they are expressed  <cit> . robo <dig>  the fourth member of the robo family is expressed in both the neural and vascular systems  <cit> . robo <dig> knockdown zebrafish embryos display intersomitic vessel  sprouting defects  <cit> . more recently, robo4ap/ap knockout mice show defects in vascular integrity that exacerbates pathological conditions associated with vascular leakage  <cit> .

robo <dig> and robo <dig> are the two endothelial relevant robos. robo <dig> has been functionally implicated in the vasculature; in the context of tumor growth  <cit> . robo <dig> and robo <dig> share similar domains in both extracellular and intracellular cytoplasmic regions, but they differ widely in the number and spatial organization of these domains  <cit> . robo <dig> contains five-immunoglobulin  and three-fibronectin domains compared to three and two respectively for zebrafish robo <dig>  <cit> . human robo <dig> differs slightly from zebrafish robo <dig> in that it only contains two igg and two fibronectin domains  <cit> . in the intracellular region, robo <dig> and robo <dig> share two of the four conserved cytoplasmic  motifs cc <dig> and cc <dig>  robos are known to homo- and hetero-dimerize, and dimerization is responsible for mediating signal transduction in neurons  <cit> .

slits are ligands for robos  <cit> . slit <dig> has been implicated as the vascular-specific slit and has been studied extensively  <cit> . contradictory results are reported in the literature regarding slit2's role in migration of endothelial cells. two groups report that slit <dig> inhibits migration of endothelial cells  <cit>  and other groups report that slit <dig> mediates positive stimulus on endothelial cells  <cit> . axon guidance molecules are well known to show such dual function  <cit> . for example, slits were originally identified as attractants of sensory axons  <cit>  and were later identified as repellents for robo+ axons  <cit> .

to date, the functional output of robos in endothelial cells is unresolved  <cit> . some reports indicate that slit <dig> binds to robo <dig> in endothelial cells and promotes migration of these cells  <cit> . however, in neurons, slit-robo <dig> interaction primarily mediates repulsive signals  <cit> . in the case of robo <dig>  the slit2-robo <dig> interaction is implicated to inhibit migration of endothelial cells in vitro  <cit> . we have demonstrated that robo <dig> also induces positive signal in endothelial cells and have implicated attraction mechanisms  <cit> . interestingly, soluble robo <dig> shows anti-angiogenic effects in vitro supporting for this possibility  <cit> .

to facilitate clarity with robos' function in endothelial cells in vitro, we have initiated a loss-of-function study of robos' in vitro. to investigate the loss of function phenotype for robo <dig> and robo <dig> in vitro, we have used dicer sirna technology to knock down endogenous robo transcripts in endothelial cells. robo <dig> and robo <dig> sirnas specifically knocks down the respective robo rnas and proteins in endothelial cells without affecting the other. robo <dig> sirna knockdown endothelial cells did not respond to serum but robo <dig> sirna knockdown cells do. slit <dig> binds to endothelial cells expressing both robos but does not bind to robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells. interestingly, robo <dig> sirna cells display pro-migratory response to slit <dig> despite lack of binding of slit <dig>  this suggests an alternative migration induced by slit <dig> in the absence of robo <dig>  indeed, slit <dig> displays chemotactic and chemokinetic activity on robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells. serum, on the other hand displays an exclusive chemotactic activity on endothelial cells, which is abolished in the absence of robo <dig> 

we had previously implicated rho gtpases in robo4-induced migration signaling complex in endothelial cells  <cit> . here, we show that robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells contain increased rho gtpase level, which is restored by transfecting back zebrafish robo <dig> suggesting that any perturbation of robo <dig> levels on endothelial cell surface results in alteration of rho gtpase homeostasis. importantly, this restoration is critical for endothelial cell chemotaxis to serum. slit <dig> treatment of endothelial cells does not induce rho gtpases suggesting that the mechanism of slit <dig> inhibition of endothelial cell migration is rho gtpase independent.

to explain the mechanism used by robos for directing endothelial cell migration, we have identified that robo <dig> and robo <dig> interact with each other and share several molecules. they both bind to slit <dig>  mena  <cit>  and vilse, a cdc42-gap. in addition, we implicate irsp <dig>  a cdc <dig> target that is down-regulated in robo <dig> knockdown cells that show no organized actin stress fiber arrangements. our data suggests that a complex of proteins  are part of a serum mediated robo <dig> signaling axis that is responsible for directional migration of endothelial cells.

RESULTS
robo <dig> sirna specifically knocks down robo <dig> rna and protein
we have first determined the expression levels of endothelial robos in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . huvecs show robust expression of robo <dig> when compared to robo <dig> . to knockdown endogenous robo <dig>  we have utilized the rna interference technology  <cit>  that relies on dicer enzyme, which converts double stranded rna into small interfering rna . we used the dicer method of generating pooled robo <dig> small interfering rna  for a robo <dig> region that was distinct from other robos since it is difficult to predict a priori which region of robo <dig> is optimal for targeting using sirna. increasing concentrations  of robo <dig> sirna resulted in a dose dependant reduction of robo <dig> transcript  with minimal change in robo <dig>  or actin transcript levels . quantitative real time pcr analysis showed that robo <dig> transcript is down regulated by 80% when compared to robo <dig> in robo <dig> sirna cells . using the dicer method, we also designed robo <dig> sirna and show that robo <dig> sirna selectively targets robo <dig> transcript  with no effect on robo <dig> rna levels .

to investigate whether robo <dig> rna knockdown correlates with protein levels, we generated a v5-tagged human robo <dig> fusion construct and co-transfected it with control lacz  or robo <dig> sirna  in 293t cells. to unambiguously show that robo <dig> protein was down in robo <dig> sirna cells, we took the transfected v5-tagged approach. protein lysates from robo <dig> sirna sample show lower amounts  of v5-tagged protein when compared to control lacz sirna co-transfected sample  or robo <dig> sirna sample . similarly robo <dig> sirna also shows selective knockdown of endogenous robo <dig> protein  with no effect on transfected v5-tag robo <dig> protein  when compared to control lacz sirna cells  or untransfected  cells . taken together, these results suggest that we have generated specific knockdown reagents that can selectively target robo <dig> and robo <dig> in endothelial cells.

serum-mediated migration responses are selectively abrogated in robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells
to investigate the robo <dig> knockdown phenotype in endothelial cells, we have performed modified boyden chamber migration assays in the presence of serum in the bottom chamber using endothelial cells transfected with robo <dig> sirna   or control lacz sirna . wild type untransfected huvecs showed a robust response to serum , and cells transfected with increasing concentrations of robo <dig> sirna showed a dose dependent decrease in migration . no difference in apoptosis was noted between control lacz and robo <dig> sirna transfected cells by annexin-fitc assay . co-transfecting a zebrafish robo <dig> construct into robo <dig> sirna transfected cells rescued the migration response to serum , suggesting that loss of migration phenotype was indeed specific to robo <dig>  we have also performed migration experiments with robo <dig> sirna endothelial cells to serum and observed no change in response  when compared to lacz sirna cells. to determine growth factor mediated responses to migration, we have performed migration assay with vascular endothelial growth factor  on lacz, robo <dig>  and robo <dig> sirna endothelial cells and found no difference in migration across the three samples . these results argue that a specific stimulus  in serum triggers robo <dig> but not robo <dig> mediated directional migration.

the loss of migration phenotype in robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells implies that robo <dig>  the other endothelial robo cannot compensate for robo <dig> function in endothelial cells. we also have already shown previously  <cit>  that the phenotype induced by robo <dig> and robo <dig> on endothelial cells are different. robo <dig> induces actin fibers that are long and thin while robo <dig> induces short and thick actin bundles along with membrane ruffles. therefore, it is possible that robo <dig> and robo <dig> serve different functions in endothelial cells.

slit <dig> binds to human endothelial cells
human slit <dig> has been previously suggested to be a ligand for robo <dig>  <cit> , and is proteolytically processed into  <dig> kda n-terminal and 55– <dig> kda c-terminal fragments in both cell culture and in vivo  <cit> . we have performed migration assay with alkaline phosphatase -tagged n-terminal fragment of slit <dig> , which in the bottom chamber had previously been shown to be the active fragment of full-length slit <dig>  <cit> . migration of control lacz sirna transfected cells is inhibited by ap-slit2n while migration of robo <dig> sirna cells is not . to determine if slit <dig> binding is altered in robo <dig> sirna transfected cells, we have performed biochemical-binding analysis taking advantage of ap-tag on slit <dig>  ap-slit2n was incubated with control lacz or robo <dig> sirna transfected endothelial cells, and bound slit <dig> was detected by ap activity in the lysate. ap activity was higher in control lacz sirna than robo <dig> sirna transfected endothelial cells suggesting that the presence of robo <dig> facilitates slit <dig> interaction on endothelial cells . slit <dig> also interacts with robo <dig> and this interaction occurs via the immunoglobulin  domains in robo <dig> and the second leucine rich repeat sequence in slit <dig>  <cit> . the kd of the slit2-robo <dig> interaction is reported to be 8– <dig> nm  <cit>  and since the igg domain is conserved in robo <dig> and robo <dig>  we predict similar kd's for slit2-robo <dig> interaction. the migration and biochemical binding analysis data taken together suggest that slit <dig> binds to endothelial cells expressing robo <dig> and robo <dig> and inhibits their migration.

slit <dig> shows both chemotactic and chemokinetic effects on endothelial cells and the chemotactic response is in part through robo4
robo <dig> sirna transfected cells did not respond to serum  but, remarkably, show a three-fold increase in migration to a slit <dig> gradient when compared to control lacz sirna cells . similar results are observed in mouse robo <dig> knockout cells. mouse robo <dig> knockout endothelial cells migrate to vegf-a better than control cells  <cit> . these results argue that irrespective of the stimulus, vegf or slit <dig>  robo <dig> sirna or robo <dig> knockout endothelial cells show a pro-migratory response.

to investigate why robo <dig> knockdown cells migrate to a slit <dig> gradient, we have determined whether the migration response was chemotactic or chemokinetic. chemotaxis is referred to directional movement towards or away from a gradient while chemokinesis is a cellular response associated to speeding up or slowing down movement and is gradient independent  <cit> . to differentiate between the two types of migration, we have performed the boyden chamber assay with control lacz sirna and robo <dig> sirna transfected cells to serum or slit <dig>  previous reports of slit <dig> on leukocyte migration clearly showed that irrespective of where slit <dig> was present, upper, lower or both chambers, slit <dig> inhibited sdf-1α induced leukocyte migration arguing for a chemokinetic and chemotactic inhibitory activity for slit <dig> in this system  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that slit <dig> behaves similarly in endothelial cell migration.

slit <dig> in the upper, lower or both chambers showed similar increased motility of robo <dig> sirna cells relative to that of control lacz sirna cells . therefore, the positive response to slit <dig> is chemokinetic. in contrast, serum stimulated only chemotactic motility of control cells. chemotaxis to serum was blocked in robo <dig> sirna cells , and this blockade was only detected when serum was in the bottom chamber. the serum response of robo <dig> knockdown cells therefore excludes the possibility that robo <dig> knockdown cells by themselves display random movement. the slit response on the other hand is a combination of chemotaxis and chemokinesis. therefore, our data indicate that slit <dig> shows both chemotactic and chemokinetic effects on endothelial cells, and the chemotactic response is in part through robo <dig> while serum mediates an exclusive chemotactic response on robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells.

mechanism of slit <dig> inhibition of endothelial migration is independent of the rho gtpase pathway
previously, we had shown that rho gtpases were activated by robo <dig> in endothelial cells  <cit> . to investigate whether active rho gtpases are modulated by slit <dig> treatment of endothelial cells, we have checked by pulldown assay for cdc42-gtp levels in control endothelial cells. slit <dig> was incubated for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min with control endothelial cells and pulldown analysis was performed on lysates from the treated cells . we did not convincingly notice an up-regulation of cdc42-gtp levels in endothelial cells treated with slit <dig> in either  <dig> or  <dig> min incubation times. . since slit <dig> treated endothelial cells do not migrate and show no activation of rho gtpases, the mechanism of slit <dig> inhibition of endothelial migration is most likely independent of the rho gtpase pathway. it is important to note that our data supports the conclusions of park  <cit>  and seth  <cit> et al., that slit <dig> inhibits migration of endothelial cells. however, removal of robo <dig> alters the slit <dig> response dramatically in that the cells move independent of the slit gradient. this data can also be interpreted as the "removal of the brake" scenario where once the cellular brake is removed the cells begin to move randomly to slit <dig> but not to serum suggesting the presence of an as yet unidentified ligand to robo <dig> in serum that mediates a specific chemotactic positive response via robo <dig>  the mouse robo <dig> knockout endothelial cell when compared to mouse wild-type lung microvascular endothelial cell also show a similar pro-migratory response to vegf-a  <cit>  and therefore suggests a common chemokinetic response to single growth factors by robo <dig> loss-of-function endothelial cells.

vilse, a cdc42-gap interacts with robo <dig> cytoplasmic tail
robo <dig> over-expressing endothelial cells show high levels of cdc42-gtp and rac-gtp  <cit>  proteins. whether the cdc42-gtp up-regulation was a result of a guanine exchange factor  up-regulation or a gtpase activating protein  sequestering was not known. we made an educated guess on vilse , since vilse interacts with the intracellular cc <dig> domain in robo <dig> that is shared by robo <dig> as well  <cit> . vilse indeed interacts with robo <dig> cytoplasmic tail  at least in hek293t cells. following slit <dig> treatment, a slight increase in robo <dig> pulldown levels is noticed  but this increase is not observed in a consistent basis and therefore vilse's interaction and its role in slit2-robo <dig> signaling is not clear. however, since serum was present in the pull-down assays, it is conceivable that vilse interaction to robo <dig> cytoplasmic tail is triggered by serum. therefore, it is possible that serum mediated recruitment of vilse, a cdc42-gap to robo <dig> cytoplasmic tail is responsible for rho gtpase activation. in terms of slit <dig>  we hypothesize that rho gtpase independent mechanisms are in play for slit <dig> inhibition of endothelial cell migration.

robo <dig> and robo <dig> interact in vitro
robo <dig> and robo <dig> share two common features in that they bind slit <dig> extracellularly and interact with vilse intracellularly. since robos are known to homo- or hetero-dimerize  <cit> , we investigated if robo <dig> and robo <dig> interact with each other by immunoprecipitation  and western blot . in one set of experiments, we transfected ha-tagged rat robo <dig> and v5-tagged human robo <dig> , while in a second set of experiments, we transfected ha-tagged rat robo <dig> construct and mouse robo <dig> constructs  into hek293t cells either alone or together. ip with v <dig> antibody  brought down robo <dig> . conversely, ip with ha antibody  resulted in pull down of mouse robo <dig> . this data suggests that both mouse and human robo <dig> interact with rat robo <dig> and that similar to neuronal robos, vascular robos also interact.

rho gtpase homeostasis is essential for robo4-induced migration
to investigate the active cdc <dig> and rac levels in robo <dig> knockdown cells, we have performed biochemical pull down analysis for cdc42-gtp and rac-gtp in the robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells. unexpectedly, the knockdown cells showed increased levels of cdc <dig> and rac-gtp , which return to baseline in cells transfected with zebrafish robo <dig> . when combined with migration rescue experiment , this result suggests that restoring the balance of active vs. inactive rho gtpases in an endothelial cell is required for chemotaxis. it is also worth noting that the previously published pull down data showed lower amounts of active cdc <dig> and rac in robo <dig> knockdown embryos  <cit> , which was performed from whole embryo lysates and not from endothelial cells in the embryo.

although robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells contain high levels of cdc42-gtp , they do not migrate to serum . this result suggests that cdc42-gtp level alone is not enough for directional migration but the interaction of active cdc <dig> presumably with other proteins involved in filopodia formation or migration is important for this function. one such protein previously implicated in cdc42-gtp induced filopodia formation is insulin receptor substrate protein  <dig> , a sh <dig> domain-containing adaptor molecule. irsp <dig> protein interacts with cdc42-gtp to promote filopodia formation in cos or swiss 3t <dig> cells via an irsp <dig> effector protein mena, an ena/vasp family member  <cit> . it is known that interaction of cdc <dig> with the crib motif of irsp <dig> relieves an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction with the n terminus, allowing the recruitment of mena to the irsp <dig> sh <dig> domain  <cit> . the irsp53:mena complex initiates actin filament assembly into filopodia. since robo <dig> interacts with mena  <cit> , we asked whether irsp <dig> protein, a target of active cdc <dig> was involved in robo <dig> signaling in endothelial cells. in robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells co-transfected with myc-irsp <dig> construct , we noticed that the irsp <dig> protein levels were lower when compared to samples of control lacz sirna transfected cells with myc-irsp <dig> . we have stained for f-actin phalloidin in robo <dig> sirna  and control lacz sirna  cells and clearly noticed a loss of organized actin stress fibers in robo <dig> sirna transfected cells. so, taking the irsp <dig> stability , actin phalloidin staining  and activated rho gtpase in robo <dig> knockdown cell  data together, a strong correlative argument can be made that in the absence of robo <dig>  irsp <dig> is unavailable for active cdc42-gtp interaction resulting in blocking of downstream events that lead to actin nucleation and filopodia formation. further, the zebrafish robo <dig> co-transfected sample  shows rho gtpase levels comparable to baseline thus allowing for endothelial cell chemotaxis to serum . this data also suggests that stabilization of irsp <dig> protein may allow for excess cdc42-gtp to be used for actin nucleation, and that a one to one correlation between irsp <dig> and cdc42-gtp molecules in a given cell may dictate the actin nucleation and filopodia formation process.

proposed mechanism of robo <dig> function in endothelial cell migration
taking all the results in this study together, we propose a working model  that is built on previous models  <cit> . in this model, we will integrate the following molecules: robo <dig>  robo <dig>  slit <dig>  non-slit ligand, cdc42-gtp, irsp <dig>  vilse and mena. here, two assumptions are in place:  slit mediated migration is chemotactic and chemokinetic in nature while serum  mediated migration is exclusively chemotactic in nature,  signaling outputs of ligand-receptor complex is context dependent and active switching between robo <dig> and robo <dig> at cell surface dictates directional migration of endothelial cell.

in situation when chemokinesis and chemotaxis are required concomitantly such as wound healing, the slit pathway is active. in the resting state i.e., in the absence of slit, cell surface robos physically interact with each other, which may keep both robos in an inactive state. another possibility is that only one robo is expressed at any given time on the cell surface and acts singularly since we know that robo levels on the cell surface are tightly regulated. therefore, the physical interaction is a safety mechanism of aberrantly activating robos on cell surface. slit binds to robo <dig> and robo <dig>  and it is not clear if this interaction is dependent on the presence of the other robo. two consequences can be predicted:  a direct negative stimulus emanates from robo <dig> or  the positive stimulus from robo <dig> is blocked. both the predictions involve a rho gtpase independent mechanism in down stream signaling events. the net output is migration of the endothelial cell forward or away from the target site.

in situation where you require exclusive chemotaxis such as during development of isvs during embryonic development, a non-slit pathway is active. again, in the resting state robo cell surface levels are tightly regulated by one of three ways:  physical interaction between the two robos or,  one robo is selectively down-regulated or,  only the particular robo of relevance is expressed on the cell of interest in this case the tip cell. to continue a directional path for the tip cell such as along the chevron of the somite, a non-slit ligand binds to robo <dig> resulting in recruitment of vilse, the net result is activation of cdc <dig>  the activated cdc <dig> interacts with the stabilized irsp <dig> in the endothelial tip cell allowing the sh <dig> domain of irsp <dig> to interact with mena . this complex of cdc42-gtp-irsp53-mena results in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement leading to filopodia formation and migration.

robo <dig> function in tip and stalk cells
robos were originally identified as axon guidance molecules and therefore a vascular robo, robo <dig> or robo <dig> was expected to function in a growth cone analogous structure in endothelial cells namely tip cells. the retinal vascular bed has been shown to contain two distinct cell types in the developing vasculature namely the tip cell and the following stalk cell  <cit> . in the retinal vasculature, it was shown that tip cells do not proliferate but merely guide the following proliferative stalk cell by a vegf-dependant process. the combined tip and stalk cell activity is thought to extend the developing endothelial sprouts. recent evidence in zebrafish has challenged the notion that tip cells don't proliferate  <cit>  since zebrafish trunk isv tip cells do. this result argues that tip cells function is tissue dependant. in zebrafish, we have noted that robo <dig> is expressed along the entire length of the intersomitic sprout comprising of both the tip and stalk cell  <cit> , and functions in a manner that is anticipated for axon guidance molecules in that robo <dig> knockdown embryos display isv defects. whether proliferation of isv cells has altered in robo <dig> knockdown embryos is not known and is being investigated. recent result of robo <dig> expression in mouse stalk cell  <cit>  raises the issue whether higher vertebrates, in particular mammals have adapted robos for other functions besides guidance. this is particularly possible given the fact that robo4ap/ap mouse did not show developmental vascular defects in the isvs or cephalic vessels  <cit> . other reasons include, robo <dig> stalk and tip cell function are species specific, vascular permeability is different in mouse and zebrafish. in the robo4ap/ap mouse it was shown that slit2-robo <dig> signaling intercepted the vegf permeability-signaling axis and is conceivable that the robo4-stalk cell-permeability function is slit dependant while the robo4-tip cell-guidance function is non-slit dependant. the in vivo expression pattern of slits in zebrafish  <cit>  and our data in this study that shows serum mediates positive chemotactic response via robo <dig> provides supporting evidence for the latter.

this study raises numerous questions. what mechanisms are in play for a cell to recognize when to invoke chemotaxis vs. chemokinesis pathways? the fine details of the model proposed here  raise several questions. is mena released from robo <dig> cytoplasmic tail on ligand binding? what is the ligand that mediates this action? what is the order of mena and vilse recruitment to the robo <dig> cytoplasmic tail? does irsp <dig> protein stability control the levels of active cdc42-gtp in endothelial cells? how do these complexes promote filopodia formation in endothelial cells? these and other issues form the basis of future work in the laboratory.

CONCLUSIONS
our data suggests that endothelial cells utilize robos in a context dependant manner and signals from surrounding milieu  dictate different responses and perhaps signals in endothelial cells.
