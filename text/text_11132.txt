BACKGROUND
lipases, also known as triacylglycerol lipases , act on ester bonds of several compounds, with acylglycerols as their natural substrates. these enzymes are able not only to catalyze under aqueous conditions the hydrolysis of triglycerides to free fatty acids, diglycerides and monoglycerides but also to carry out synthesis and trans- and interesterification reactions in the presence of organic solvents. lipases are produced by animals, plants and microorganisms, but the latter have gained special interest in the industry due to their stability, selectivity or wide substrate specificity. some of the most commercially important lipases belong to yeasts, such as candida rugosa  and candida antarctica, or filamentous fungi, such as aspergillus niger, humicola lanuginosa, mucor miehei, and rhizopus species  <cit> . sterol esterases , also known as cholesterol esterases, act on esters of sterols and long-chain fatty acids. the mammalian cholesterol esterases are the best known for their role in lipid metabolism and cholesterol absorption  <cit>  but these proteins have also been reported in filamentous fungi, yeast and bacteria  <cit> .

both kinds of enzymes, lipases and sterol esterases, belong to the α/β-hydrolase superfamily and some of them show broad substrate specificity, including triglycerides and water insoluble sterol esters. for example, c. rugosa secretes a variety of closely related enzymes, commercialized as lipases or sterol esterases. although at least three of them  display activity on both triglycerides and cholesteryl oleate, they differ in their specificity  <cit> . in the case of sterol esterases, this promiscuity has been reported for the enzymes characterized in ophiostoma piceae <cit>  and melanocarpus albomyces <cit> .

lipases are generally strongly activated by water–lipid interfaces  <cit> . the active site of these enzymes presents a hydrophobic cavity covered by an amphipathic loop named “lid” or “flap” and most of them show interfacial activation, a phenomenon that occurs by the movement of the flap caused by a conformational change on this helical element, making the enzyme’s active site more accessible to the substrate  <cit> . this property has been considered as a distinguishing feature between lipases and sterol esterases although lipases lacking a flap  <cit>  and sterol esterases showing interfacial activation have been reported  <cit> . these structural elements have been exhaustively studied in c. rugosa lipases and sterol esterases to understand the substrate specificity of the different isoenzymes. the five extracellular enzymes  characterized in this yeast have  <dig> amino acids, present a high level of sequence identity  but show differences on pi and putative n-glycosilation sites  <cit> . the structural comparisons of three of them  revealed several amino acid changes affecting the flap, the substrate-binding pocket and the hydrophobic tunnel, that could be responsible for the differences in their catalytic properties  <cit> . this family of lipases forms the so called c. rugosa lipase-like family , which comprises proteins of relatively large molecular masses  that contain a gesag sequence located in the middle of the polypeptide chains, corresponding to the position  <dig> in c. rugosa lip <dig>  one of the enzymes described in more detail at the biochemical and structural levels  <cit> . the ser in this sequence functions as a catalytic residue and constitutes a ‘catalytic triad’ together with the conserved glu and his residues that are presumed to facilitate the hydrolysis  <cit> . these enzymes also contain the sequence gggf involved in the oxyanionic hole , which allows the substrate entry into the catalytic pocket. most of these characteristics are present in the o. piceae sterol esterase, which shows more than 40% sequence identity with c. rugosa lipases and similar substrate-binding sites, as suggested by its structural model based on the crystal structures of c. rugosa lip <dig>  <cit> .

nowadays, with the development of new molecular techniques such as massive dna sequencing, the genomes of an enormous number of organisms can be studied in a short time. in this sense, the joint genome institute  from the us department of energy  was pioneer in this kind of projects, and more than  <dig> genomes from different fungi with potential biotechnological interest are currently accessible in its website . bioinformatics approaches to analyze these genomes allow the finding of new enzymes taking into account the analysis of conserved motifs in the available dna sequences  <cit> . furthermore, molecular modeling plays a key role in structural biology. current methods to study protein structure are very interesting to discover enzymes with improved catalytic properties and activities  <cit> .

in the present work we carried out a bioinformatics screening of public fungal genomes deposited at jgi to explore the presence of genes encoding sterol esterases/lipases from the genomes of environmental microorganisms, as a strategy to find novel enzymes. the candidates were selected taking into account the conserved motifs detected in versatile lipases and sterol esterases described in yeast or filamentous fungi. the kinetic properties of the new putative enzymes are discussed on the basis of their three-dimensional model structure, built from the crystal structures of c. rugosa lipases.

methods
genomes screening
seven sterol esterases/lipases with wide substrate versatility and potential industrial application, as c. rugosa lipases  and sterol esterases from o. piceae   <cit>  and m. albomyces <cit> , were selected. the search for conserved motifs in the amino acidic sequence was carried out using meme . in all  <dig> sequences the motifs gesag  and gggf  were found. these motifs are already described in the “the lipase engineering database” for the lipases of the c. rugosa lipase-like family  <cit> .

to search for genes codifying this kind of proteins in the public genomes from http://www.jgi.doe.gov/ <cit> , the automatically predicted proteins from all  <dig> fungal genomes containing the terms “esterase”  or “lipase”  were downloaded using the advanced search option at the jgi web-site. from this pool of sequences  the ones containing the conserved motifs gesag and gggf were selected using the bioedit  <dig> . <dig> software.

phylogenetic analysis
a phylogenetic tree was built using the  <dig> protein sequences selected in the previous section and representative sequences of different lipase and sterol esterase families: c. rugosa-like , yarrowia family, brefeldin family, cellular organelles, pancreas and bacteria . an un-rooted tree was created using muscle multiple sequence alignment and the maximum-likelihood method. treeview  <dig> . <dig> was used to draw the trees. sequences grouping with the versatile lipases and sterol esterases from the c. rugosa-like family were selected for further analyses.

sequence analysis
sequences from the  <dig> candidates selected in the previous section were compared by means of blast against the nr  and “the lipase engineering data project”  databases. sequence alignments were also carried out versus c. rugosa lip <dig> sequence using clustal x  <dig> , and putative signal peptides in each sequence were predicted using signalp  <dig>   <cit> .

structural models
a three-dimensional model of the selected putative proteins was generated using the programs implemented by the automated protein homology-modeling server swiss-model . in all cases the selected template, with higher homology to the putative sequence, was c. rugosa lip <dig> . the  <dig> models matched all the sequence length excepting the putative signal peptide.

the models were exhaustively analyzed using pymol  <dig>  . putative intramolecular tunnels were modeled from the catalytic serine using caver  <dig>  v <dig>   <cit> .

RESULTS
this study shows an interesting bioinformatics approach to find new sterol esterases/lipases from the genomes of environmental microorganisms thanks to the natural engineering process driven by evolution.

identification of conserved motifs in lipase/sterol esterase enzymes and search in public microbial genomes
after the analysis of the protein sequences described as lipase/sterol-esterase with versatile activity against triglycerides and sterol esters, two conserved motifs described for α/β hydrolases of the c. rugosa-like family were identified: gggf and gesag.

the search of putative proteins automatically annotated as sterol esterase or lipase in the  <dig> public genomes deposited in the jgi returned only  <dig> sequences from  <dig> different genomes.

phylogenetic analysis
figure  <dig> shows a phylogenetic tree with the  <dig> putative enzymes from the different genomes analyzed, as well as representative sterol-esterases/lipases from different fungal families. twelve putative proteins from the jgi genomes grouped with the lipases from the lipolitic yeast yarrowia <cit>  or the bacillus subtilis brefeldin a family  <cit> , typical enzymes with high affinity for triglycerides whose ability to hydrolyze sterol esters has not been reported. on the other hand, this figure shows  <dig> of the candidate proteins grouped with the c. rugosa-like family, and  <dig> out of these putative proteins were selected to continue the study because they were the most closely related to the proteins from c. rugosa   <cit> , o. piceae   <cit> , and m. albomyces <cit>  with activity on both triglycerides and sterol esters. the  <dig> candidate proteins belong to different organisms but all of them are plant-associated fungi . species from the genus neurospora are known for their ability to colonize the wood from the trees after forest fires,  <cit> . the plant pathogenic nectria haematococca has also been related to the degradation of aromatic recalcitrant compounds,  <cit> . trichoderma species are frequently isolated from forest or agricultural soils, and are known for their ability to produce enzymes of industrial relevance  <cit> . aspergillus niger secretes a wide array of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes  <cit> . pyrenophora tritici-repenti is a plant pathogen causing a disease called “tan spot” that mainly affects wheat  <cit> . finally, the genus alternaria comprises many common saprophytic and plant pathogenic species  <cit> .

accession number q2mdg <dig> corresponds to sterol esterase precursor from melanocarpus albomyces, and accession number q5xtq <dig> to botryotinia fuckeliana lipase.

the ecological role of the extracellular lipases/esterases in these fungi can be related to the initial degradation of the epicuticular waxes and cuticle, which consist of a mixture of long-chain fatty acids, aldehydes, alkanes, primary and secondary alcohols, ketones and wax esters  <cit> . the deterioration of these external layers makes the plant cell-wall polysaccharides more accessible as carbon source for the plant-associated fungi, or facilitates the colonization by pathogenic species  <cit> .

candidate sequences analysis
the six candidate sequences as putative versatile enzymes with lipase and sterol esterase activity were compared against ncbi and led databases using blastp. in all cases, the highest score matched with both a sterol esterase precursor from m. albomyces <cit>  and the lipase from botryotinia fuckeliana <cit> , with sequence identities between  <dig> and 75% . the sequence identity of each candidate with the c. rugosa lip <dig>  used as a model protein, is shown in table  <dig>  all these data correlate with the results from the phylogenetic analysis .

additional file:  <dig> figure s <dig> shows the sequence alignment of lip <dig> against the versatile lipase/esterase candidates, highlighting the predicted signal peptides at the n-terminal of the putative proteins consisting in  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, the  <dig> conserved cys residues forming disulfide bonds and delimiting the lid region, the oxyanionic hole , and the catalytic triad . an n-glycosylation site is present in all the sequences analyzed, except for jgi|trire2|78828|.

moreover, it is known that the number of hydrophobic amino acids at the lid region is related to enzyme-substrate specificity  <cit> . lipase isoenzymes from c. rugosa share over 80% sequence identity but diverge in the sequence of the lid. in the active enzyme conformation, the open lid participates in the substrate-binding site and contributes to substrate recognition. the substitution of the lid from isoenzyme lip <dig> for that of lip <dig> was sufficient to confer to lip <dig> cholesterol esterase activity  <cit> . additional file:  <dig> figure s <dig> shows the differences in the residues located at the lid region of the putative proteins. the number of hydrophobic residues is  <dig> in necha <dig> and trire <dig>   <dig> in altbr <dig>   <dig> in pyrtr <dig> and neudi <dig>  and  <dig> in aspni <dig>  while lip <dig> only contains  <dig>  the number of hydrophobic residues in the lid of the different lipases produced by c. rugosa is higher in the isoforms that are more active on sterol esters than on triglycerides: lip <dig> > lip <dig> > lip <dig>   <cit> . according to this data, the o. piceae sterol esterase, with  <dig> hydrophobic residues in lid region, has been reported to possess higher activity on sterol esters than c. rugosa lip <dig>  <cit> . based on these observations it can be inferred that necha <dig>  trire <dig>  pyrtr <dig>  and altbr <dig> may have high affinity for sterol esters, while neudi <dig> and aspni <dig> could have intermediate characteristics.

molecular modeling analysis of selected candidates
molecular models of the selected putative candidate sequences were generated using swiss-model server and in all cases the template automatically selected was lip <dig> from c. rugosa , one of the versatile lipases better characterized  <cit> . figure  <dig> displays the comparison of the 3d structures obtained, showing the typical α/β-hydrolase conformation  <cit>  with a lid region formed by an α-helix which, in most lipases, allows a conformational change in the presence of the substrate improving its accessibility to the active site  <cit> . a superimposition of the residues from the catalytic triad in the  <dig> candidate models and the lip <dig> structure, showed an identical geometry in all cases, with the catalytic ser close to the mouth of the substrate pocket .

the percentage of hydrophobic residues at a distance of 4 Å or shorter from the predicted tunnels was calculated for each model. trire <dig> had  <dig> hydrophobic residues out of  <dig> in the tunnel area , similar to aspni <dig> that had  <dig> out of  <dig>  and pyrtr <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> . however, neudi <dig> presented a higher number of these residues  <dig> out of  <dig>  and necha <dig> showed even higher number,  <dig> out of  <dig> . altbr <dig> had less hydrophobic residues  <dig> out of  <dig> . in the case of c. rugosa lipases, lip <dig> had  <dig> out of  <dig> , lip <dig> presented  <dig> out of  <dig>  and lip <dig> showed  <dig> out of  <dig> , being lip <dig> and  <dig> the ones with the highest affinity for sterol esters. ope, with higher affinity than any lip on sterol esters, has  <dig> hydrophobic residues out of  <dig>  in the tunnels area. since all the selected putative enzymes, except altbr <dig>  presented more hydrophobic residues than ope and lip <dig> and  <dig>  this could be indicative of its increased affinity for sterol esters.

the model of the internal tunnels in each structure was made using caver  <dig>  . in all cases, a big tunnel coinciding with the substrate binding pocket and a second putative tunnel that may be an exit for the release of the reaction products can be observed. this hypothesis was already proposed for c. rugosa lip <dig> as a possible mechanism responsible for the high catalytic efficiency of this enzyme  <cit> . the length and shape of these tunnels differ for each model and the residues forming the tunnels can also vary. lip <dig> has a prominent entry tunnel and a bended exit tunnel, similar to that reported for lip <dig>  <cit> , while the o. piceae sterol esterase model presented a broad straight tunnel opposed to the substrate pocket, which could contribute to its reported higher catalytic efficiency as compared with lip <dig>  <cit> .

neudi <dig>  pyrt <dig> and aspni <dig> showed a prominent entry tunnel and a bended exit tunnel, similar to lip <dig> structure . altbr <dig>  necha <dig> and trire <dig> presented a broad straight tunnel opposed to the substrate pocket, in this case more similar to that found in o. piceae sterol esterase . as mentioned before, altbr <dig> has the smallest hydrophobic residues content in the tunnel, indicating that this characteristic is not strictly related to its shape, and that it could be a very efficient enzyme oxidizing triglycerides. all these data suggest that those putative enzymes with ope-like tunnels could be more efficient than those with c. rugosa-like tunnels, allowing a faster entry of the substrate and exit of the products, and the hydrolysis of big substrates.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present a useful strategy to identify enzymes with potential biotechnological interest by means of genomes mining. the strategy combines search of conserved motifs, phylogenetic analysis, sequence homology studies and protein model analysis. this strategy allowed identifying  <dig> candidate sequences . the six putative proteins selected were automatically annotated at jgi server except for aspni <dig> that has been manually annotated as a putative sterol esterase with homology to the enzyme from o. piceae. in this study we inferred the potential characteristics of the putative enzymes based on their model structures. our analysis, derived from the percentage of hydrophobic residues in the lid region, suggests that the affinity towards sterol esters of all the candidate proteins selected could be superior to that of the c. rugosa model lipases. in addition, the putative proteins altbr <dig>  necha <dig>  and trire <dig> may also have higher efficiency against this substrate than c. rugosa lipases due to their exit tunnel conformation. however, further studies on the expression and characterization of these new proteins will be necessary to corroborate their potential biotechnological or industrial interest.
