BACKGROUND
although most cellular proteins are part of protein complexes, little is known about how the formation of protein complexes occurs in vivo. to address this question we recently used a method called rip-chip  to identify mrnas associated with specific proteins. we found that ~38% of a set of proteins with varied structures and functions interacted with mrnas known or predicted to encode proteins that interact with the bait proteins. we also discovered that these associations required the presence of the protein encoded by the mrna as well as active translation. these results indicated that the interaction between the bait protein and the protein encoded by the associated mrna takes place cotranslationally . the immunoprecipitated protein is associated with the nascent peptide together with the mrna that is being translated, allowing the identification of the nascent peptide through its mrna . this appeared to be a widespread phenomenon, and applied to proteins with diverse structures and function, such as protein kinases, kinesins, proteasome components, transcription factors, etc.
 <cit> . similar results had been obtained for individual protein-mrna pairs
 <cit> , but our work and that of others demonstrated that this phenomenon could be addressed at the genome-wide level and in an unbiased manner using rip-chip
 <cit> . our observations suggested that protein-mrna interactions discovered by rip-chip could be used to identify novel protein-protein interactions. to test this hypothesis we followed up a previously described interaction between the sty <dig> map-kinase and the cip <dig> mrna
 <cit> , which encodes an rna-binding protein, and found that both proteins coimmunoprecipitate. moreover, we present a novel interaction between the exo <dig> protein  and an mrna that encodes an uncharacterised protein that shows no homology to other proteins . as hypothesised, we found that the two proteins coimmunoprecipitate in vitro and colocalise in vivo. this work demonstrates that genome-wide protein-mrna interaction datasets can be used to predict protein-protein associations.

RESULTS
the sty <dig> protein is a map kinase that mediates stress responses in fission yeast. rip-chip experiments revealed that sty <dig> interacts with two mrnas
 <cit> : pyp <dig>  which encodes a protein phosphatase known to physically interact with sty1
 <cit> , and cip <dig>  which codes for an rna-binding protein that regulates the response to oxidative stress
 <cit> . we have shown that the interaction between the sty <dig> protein and the cip <dig> mrna requires active translation of cip <dig>  as it is disrupted when translation is inhibited using puromycin and when the cip <dig> initiation codon is mutated
 <cit> . this strongly suggested that sty <dig> binds to cip <dig> as the cip <dig> protein is being synthesised on the polysome. we therefore predicted that the sty <dig> and cip <dig> proteins interact with each other. to test this hypothesis we epitope-tagged sty <dig> and cip <dig>  and used strains carrying the tagged proteins for coimmunoprecipitation experiments. as predicted, sty1-myc copurified specifically with cip2-tap . to confirm the specificity of the interactions we repeated the experiment using sty1-myc and cip2-gfp. consistent with the previous result, cip2-gfp copurified with immunoprecipitated sty1-myc . moreover, the interaction cip2-tap and sty1-myc was not disrupted by treatment with rnase, indicating that the associations are not mediated by the cip <dig> mrna, and thus that both proteins are part of the same complex . these results show that rip-chip data can be used to predict protein-protein interactions.

to confirm the general applicability of this principle, we decided to use a binding partner of unknown function. as part of a study of the regulation of mrna decay in fission yeast, we performed rip-chip experiments with the exo <dig> protein, which is the s. pombe homologue of the xrn <dig> 5′- > 3′ exonuclease
 <cit>  . a tap-tagged version of exo <dig> copurified with only two mrnas: spbc19g <dig> c, and spac12g <dig> . spbc19g <dig> c encodes an orthologue of the pat <dig> protein, which is a known interactor of xrn <dig> in yeast and higher eukaryotes
 <cit> , and we refer to it hereafter as ppo <dig> . spac12g <dig>  encodes a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids that lacks any known domain and does not display homology to any other protein. we named this gene eti <dig>  for exo two interacting . to confirm that these interactions reflected cotranslational assembly, we incubated cells expressing exo2-tap with puromycin to disrupt active translation, and used them for rip-chip experiments. this treatment led to a complete loss of interaction between exo <dig> and both ppo <dig> and eti <dig> mrnas . moreover, disruption of polysomes in vitro by incubating exo2-tap extracts with edta caused a similar effect . we also tested if these interactions were symmetrical, that is, whether eti <dig> would interact with the exo <dig> and ppo <dig> mrnas. rip-chip experiments with eti1-tap  did not reveal any enriched mrnas, indicating that the interactions were unidirectional. this might indicate that exo <dig> can only bind to eti <dig> in vivo before eti <dig> is fully translated and folded. based on these data, we hypothesised that the exo <dig> and eti <dig> proteins form a complex in vivo. to test this idea we made strains expressing tap-tagged exo <dig> and myc-tagged eti <dig>  myc-tagged eti <dig> coprecipitated with tap-tagged exo <dig>  indicating that both proteins interact . a strain containing eti1-tap and exo2-myc showed a similar association , confirming that the interactions were not dependent on the specific epitope tags used for the experiment. furthermore, the interactions were resistant to rnase treatment, indicating that both proteins are part of the same complex .

to prove that the association also takes place in vivo, we tagged exo <dig> and eti <dig> with different fluorescent proteins. exo <dig> and eti <dig> could be detected by fluorescence microscopy in very weak cytoplasmic foci reminiscent of processing bodies  in vegetatively growing cells . pbs are large cytoplasmic rna – protein complexes that include multiple proteins involved in mrna degradation
 <cit> , such as components of the decapping complex  and the 5′- > 3′ exonuclease exo2
 <cit> . however, pbs do not contain the poly binding protein pabp
 <cit> . to investigate the identity of these granules we coexpressed exo <dig> and eti <dig> with the pb marker dcp <dig>  as previously reported
 <cit> , we could observe dcp <dig> in discrete but weak cytoplasmic foci . although the weakness of the fluorescence signals of the tagged proteins precluded us from performing extensive the colocalization studies, we detected structures containing both dcp <dig> and eti <dig> , suggesting that eti <dig> may be a component of pbs.

glucose starvation caused the formation of bright cytoplasmic foci that contained both eti <dig> and exo <dig>  supporting the biochemical data on the coprecipitation of both proteins . these structures were reminiscent of stress granules, which are cytoplasmic aggregates of proteins and mrnas formed in response to environmental stress. to characterize these foci further we used pabp as a well-established marker of stress granules
 <cit> . both eti <dig> and exo <dig> clearly colocalized with pabp and dcp <dig>  suggesting that both proteins are components of stress granules .

finally, we tested whether exo <dig> and eti <dig> required each other for their localization. in eti1Δ cells, as in a wild type background, exo2-gfp was visualized as very weak foci in vegetative cells, but moved to stress granules upon glucose starvation . pabp-gfp also relocalized normally, indicating that eti <dig> is not required for stress granule assembly . by contrast, eti <dig> was present in bright granules in exo2Δ cells even in unstressed cells . inhibition of rna decay by inactivation of xrn1/exo <dig> in yeast causes an increase in the number and size of pbs in budding yeast cells, presumably due to the accumulation of decay intermediates
 <cit> . eti1-containing granules in exo2Δ mutants did not contain pabp , consistent with the idea that these foci represent pbs.

altogether, biochemical and cytological data confirm that exo <dig> and eti <dig> are part of the same complex, and suggest that eti <dig> is a novel component of stress granules.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that cotranslational mrna-protein interactions detected using rip-chip can be used to predict protein-protein associations. the nature and behaviour of the proteins we identified suggest that the interactions may have biological importance. for example, there is evidence that sty <dig> regulates the phosphorylation of cip2: cip <dig> is phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress, and this phosphorylation does not take place in sty <dig> mutants
 <cit> . our results demonstrate that sty <dig> and cip <dig> are associated, and suggest that sty <dig> may directly phosphorylate cip <dig>  in the case of eti <dig>  the interactions between exo <dig> and eti <dig> allowed us to identify a novel component of stress granules, which might be involved in rna decay. although only a small fraction of protein-protein interactions appear to form cotranslationally
 <cit> , rip-chip experiments often identify key partners of high biological significance and have a very low false positive rate. for example, rip-chip with the cdc <dig> protein, the fission yeast cdk <dig>  identified mrnas encoding key regulators of the g1/s transition  and of s phase initiation 
 <cit> . it is important to note that the associations revealed by rip-chip may not be direct. for example, a preformed protein complex might interact with a nascent peptide. we propose that rip-chip can serve as a complementary method to mass spectrometry-based techniques to identify interacting partners of a given protein.
