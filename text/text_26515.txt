BACKGROUND
atp-binding cassette  transporters are one of the largest membrane protein super-families and are present in all biota from prokaryotes to mammals. they play a fundamental role in the transport of exogenous and endogenous compounds across inter- and intracellular boundaries. malfunction of certain members of the abc family causes various diseases, such as tangier disease, cystic fibrosis and dubin-johnson syndrome  <cit> . among transporters that lower the cellular load of various toxicants and drugs and thus maintain physiological integrity is abcb1a or p-glycoprotein, the best studied abc transporter thus far. it confers so-called multidrug resistance  by diverting a range of drugs away from their site of pharmacologic action, a central concern in drug design for cancer therapy. on the other hand, abcb1-like activity that was found in a wide range of organisms provides protection from toxicants, granting so-called multixenobiotic resistance   <cit> . indeed, knock-out of abcb <dig> in mice led to an increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier for neurotoxic compounds, allowing for enhanced brain penetration and lethal effects  <cit> . moreover, occurrence of aquatic species in polluted environments is linked to high expression and increased efflux activity of abcb <dig> orthologs  <cit> , which are constituents of the transporter-mediated “environment-tissue barrier”  <cit> . in fact, mammalian abcb <dig> is regarded as the only abc transporter that has no physiological function other than protection of cells against a wide range of chemicals  <cit> . in contrast, two other abc transporters that are structurally highly similar to abcb <dig>  abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  appear not to be involved in cellular protection against toxicants. abcb <dig> has a specific physiological function in the liver and transports only particular compounds  <cit> . over-expression of abcb <dig> in certain cancer cells is associated with multidrug resistance  <cit> , but it may not provide toxicant protection to cells in its normal function.

ex utero embryo development is common among aquatic organisms and requires cellular adaptations affording explicit robustness and protection against adverse environmental impacts. these “orphan” embryos are literally flooded with a multitude of natural and man-made chemicals and efflux transporter proteins appear to form a primary defense mechanism that keeps these compounds out  <cit> . for instance, embryos of the echiuroid worm, urechis caupo, which develop in mudflats containing metabolic products of bacteria and plants, showed high levels of abcb1-like efflux activity  <cit> .

the zebrafish  embryo has emerged as a valuable vertebrate model in diverse fields, such as genetics and human disease, pharmacology and toxicology  <cit> . while it represents the most diverse group of vertebrates - fishes - it also offers the exquisiteness of fast development, access to genetic manipulation, comparability of organogenesis to higher vertebrates and transparency, along with suitability for high-throughput screening. for example,  <dig> chemicals were evaluated for potential human health and ecological effects as part of the u.s. environmental protection agency’s  toxcast™ phase-i program  and thousands of chemicals were screened to identify novel neuroactive drugs in a high-throughput behavioral assay with zebrafish embryos  <cit> . moreover, developments are underway to establish the zebrafish embryo for rapid evaluation of the toxicity and bioaccumulation potential of the thousands of chemicals undergoing environmental risk assessment instead of relying on juvenile and adult fish  <cit> . the role of abc transporters in the zebrafish developmental processes and in dealing with chemical exposure is, however, as yet unknown, and uptake and distribution of chemicals are generally assumed to be driven by passive diffusion.

we here demonstrate that the uptake of chemicals by zebrafish embryos can in fact be substantially influenced by abc transporter activity. throughout the first  <dig> hours of development, zebrafish embryos exhibit activity of an abcb1-like efflux. surprisingly, however, an abcb <dig> ortholog appears to be absent in zebrafish. we found gene expression of abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> in zebrafish embryos that both are structurally similar to mammalian abcb <dig> and we show that abcb <dig>  but not abcb <dig>  protein possesses functional properties of mammalian abcb <dig>  constituting an active barrier against chemical uptake and conferring resistance of embryos to abcb <dig> substrates.

RESULTS
p-glycoproteins in zebrafish are abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> orthologs
three structurally similar proteins, abcb <dig>  abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  are considered as “p-glycoproteins”. the zebrafish possesses only two p-glycoprotein genes that, being annotated as abcb <dig> orthologs, were previously designated abcb1a and abcb1b; abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> were considered absent  <cit> . we confirmed the predicted cdna sequences of both genes by cloning. nucleotide sequence identity of the cdnas is 59% and the deduced amino acid sequences show  <dig> to 64% identities with human abcb <dig>  abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> .

according to current annotations on the ensembl database  <cit>  former abcb1a is designated abcb <dig>  and former abcb1b is abcb <dig> ; an abcb <dig> ortholog is absent. our synteny analyses of the respective chromosomal localizations of the genes in zebrafish are in line with the ensembl annotations and support that the zebrafish p-glycoproteins are not abcb <dig> orthologs. human abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> are consecutively located, whereas in zebrafish there is only one p-glycoprotein in a corresponding chromosome region. this gene is in close proximity to crot, resembling human abcb <dig> and crot . furthermore, genes characteristic for the close vicinity of human and other vertebrate abcb <dig> genes, comprising rundc3b, slc25a <dig> and adam <dig>  are located approximately  <dig> megabases  away from this locus in zebrafish. in concordance with zebrafish, other fish species  also possess only abcb <dig>  but not abcb <dig> , whereas takifugu rubripes and tetraodon nigroviridis have both abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> . analysis of the abcb1a/abcb <dig> chromosomal localization indicates that zebrafish abcb1a is an abcb <dig> ortholog. this chromosomal region of abcb <dig> shares synteny with human abcb <dig> , indicating that this locus has a common ancestral origin. zebrafish abcb1a/abcb <dig> protein also associates with abcb <dig> orthologs from other organisms in a phylogenetic tree .

in this tree, proteins from different fish species designated as “abcb4”, “abcb1”, “mdr1” or “p-glycoprotein” group to a cluster of fish p-glycoproteins that show close relationship with tetrapod abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> . this suggests that tetrapod and teleost abcb1/abcb <dig> and abcb4/abcb <dig> have a common ancestor. mammalian abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> sequences are highly similar but the functions of the proteins largely differ. whereas substrate recognition of abcb <dig> is rather unspecific, enabling it to act as a versatile efflux pump of toxicants, abcb <dig> is a highly specialized transporter that trans-locates certain phospholipids and does not efflux toxicants from cells  <cit> . differences in function despite the high sequence similarity of abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> raise the question if functional properties of the closely related fish p-glycoproteins are abcb1- or abcb4-like and if they are toxicant transporters. further, the ability of human abcb <dig> to confer multidrug resistance of cancer cells  <cit>  may suggest that the zebrafish abcb <dig> ortholog may act as a cellular efflux pump of toxicants.

the absence of an abcb <dig> ortholog contradicted detection of an abcb1-like efflux activity and multixenobiotic resistance of zebrafish embryos . we, hence, investigated whether instead the other p-glycoproteins, abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  act as toxicant transporters.

abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> transcripts are constitutively expressed during the first  <dig> hours of zebrafish embryo development
we examined constitutive expression levels of abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> transcripts in zebrafish embryos from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf  for determining if these genes are transcribed and thus are candidates to be involved in cellular toxicant defense in these stages. transcripts of both transporters were present at all sampled time points of development  . abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> transcript levels varied one to two orders of magnitude among developmental stages, but expression was generally low in comparison to, for example, β-actin with transcript levels that were three to four orders of magnitude higher. from the different embryonic stages considered transporter transcript levels of both transporters were highest at  <dig> hpf; abcb <dig> was lowest at  <dig> hpf, increasing from there on; abcb <dig> levels varied from stage to stage . transcripts in  <dig> and  <dig> hpf embryos are maternally transferred mrna as de novo transcription is initiated between mid-blastula  and gastrula stages   <cit> .

the mrna abundances were determined in embryos at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post fertilization . the expression levels that were normalized to 18s rrna are shown as means ± sd of four independent rna isolations. expression values were multiplied by  <dig> for clarity of presentation. beta-actin transcript levels are exemplarily shown for a highly expressed gene for comparison.

whole-mount in situ hybridization  revealed ubiquitous, weak constitutive abcb <dig> expression in the developmental period of zebrafish embryos examined here, which is indicated by faint purple staining of the entire embryos at the examined stages . specificity of the probe we used was confirmed with  <dig> hpf embryos where a strong wish signal occurred in the gut . when assuming that transcript levels are indicative of protein expression and activity, the ubiquitous expression of abcb <dig> transcripts found in  <dig> and  <dig> hpf embryos suggests a general continuous abcb <dig> activity in all embryonic cells in this developmental phase.

expression of abcb <dig> transcripts has been found in epidermal cells of zebrafish embryos  <cit> , which could point to a similar function of the protein as in mammals where it regulates membrane potential and cell fusion of skin progenitor cells  <cit> .

abcb <dig> but not abcb <dig> antagonizes accumulation of fluorescent transporter substrates in zebrafish embryos
having shown that abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> transcripts are present in zebrafish embryos, we examined the function of the corresponding proteins as efflux pumps. rhodamine b and calcein-am served as proxies for efflux transporter activity. efflux transporter activity is indicated when the accumulation of fluorescent dye substrates is increased in cells due to disrupted transporter activity and, hence, disrupted active efflux of dye by transporter inhibiting chemicals  <cit>  or by knock-down of the transporter protein.

effects of transporter inhibitors on accumulation of rhodamine b and calcein-am/calcein in tissues of zebrafish embryos
we measured changes in uptake of these dyes by embryos in the presence of two pharmacologic inhibitors of mammalian p-glycoproteins, namely cyclosporin a  <cit>  and psc <dig>  <cit> , and of mk <dig>  an inhibitor of mammalian abcc transporters  <cit> . fluorescence micrographs of embryos show that rhodamine b accumulated mainly in the yolk sac, whereas calcein fluorescence appeared in the head, trunk and cells scattered in the embryo body surface . calcein-am is non-fluorescent, but once inside cells, it is hydrolyzed by cytosolic esterases and forms green, fluorescent calcein. thus, calcein fluorescence in addition to efflux transporter activity also depends on the rate of calcein formation by esterases. rhodamine b, on the other hand, is already fluorescent without modification in the cell and these differences may explain the differing spatial accumulation patterns of the dyes in embryo tissues. fluorescence intensities of both dyes were increased when cyclosporin a, psc <dig> or mk <dig>  was also present, indicating elevated dye accumulation in the embryos. thus, without an inhibitor, the accumulation of dyes in the embryos is kept low, evidencing that both rhodamine b and calcein-am are kept out of embryo tissues by an active efflux mechanism.

for quantifying amounts of accumulated dye in embryos of different developmental stages, we measured rhodamine b levels in embryo tissue extracts following one hour of dye exposure. rhodamine b amounts per embryo in controls, indicating the basal accumulation of the dye in the embryos with efflux transporters functioning, were approximately  <dig> fmol at  <dig> hpf, increasing to approximately  <dig> fmol at  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf and at  <dig> hpf and approximately  <dig> fmol at  <dig> hpf . enhanced accumulation of dye with the inhibitors cyclosporin a, psc <dig> and mk <dig> was seen in embryos of all tested developmental stages, which demonstrates efflux transporter activities in all those stages. rhodamine b tissue levels were elevated with increasing inhibitor concentrations and were up to  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold higher compared to controls . for example, at  <dig> μm cyclosporin a or  <dig> μm psc <dig>  amounts of rhodamine b per embryo at  <dig> hpf were approximately  <dig>  fmol and approximately  <dig>  fmol, respectively. mk <dig> also increased dye accumulation in the embryos, but it was less potent than cyclosporin a and psc <dig>  thus, at  <dig> μm mk <dig>  rhodamine b amounted to approximately  <dig> fmol per  <dig> hpf embryo.

effects of morpholino knock-down of abcb <dig> and/or abcb <dig> on accumulation of rhodamine b and calcein-am/calcein in tissues of zebrafish embryos
we examined whether abcb <dig> and/or abcb <dig> mediate cellular efflux activity in the embryos with morpholino knock-down. we used splice-blocking morpholinos for knock-down of abcb <dig>  and abcb <dig>  proteins, respectively, and assayed rhodamine b and calcein-am uptake by those embryos at  <dig> hpf. control morpholino-treated embryos  served as the control for unspecific effects of morpholino injection on dye uptake. abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> knock-down did not cause phenotypic or necrotic effects, indicating that both abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> are not essential for development or basic physiological homeostasis in embryos up to  <dig> hpf. this is reminiscent of abcb <dig> knock-out mice that also develop normally  <cit> . in the dye assays, rhodamine b and calcein fluorescence were brighter upon abcb <dig> knock-down compared to the control, whereas abcb <dig> knock-down had no visible effect on dye uptake . upon abcb <dig> knock-down, approximately  <dig> fmol rhodamine b accumulated per  <dig> hpf embryo compared to approximately  <dig> fmol and approximately  <dig> fmol in abcb <dig> knock-down and control morpholino treated embryos, respectively . abcb <dig> knock-down with a translation-blocking morpholino  resulted in accumulation of approximately  <dig> fmol rhodamine b per embryo, which is similar to the effect of the abcb <dig> splice-blocking morpholino . these results show that changes in rhodamine b or calcein accumulation were specifically related to abcb <dig> knock-down. thus, abcb <dig>  but not abcb <dig>  appears to act as an efflux pump of rhodamine b and calcein-am, respectively, keeping tissue concentrations of these compounds in zebrafish embryos low.

from these data, efflux of rhodamine b can clearly be associated with abcb <dig> activity; however, the effect of abcb <dig> knock-down on rhodamine b accumulation in the embryos was not as pronounced as with high cyclosporin a and psc <dig> concentrations . the reason for this discrepancy of abcb <dig> knock-down and inhibitor effects could be that morpholino knock-down does not result in complete suppression of abcb <dig> protein function. thus, morpholino treatment that leads to transient knock-down of correct pre-mrna splicing or mrna translation does not necessarily result in complete elimination of functional protein; thus, to a certain extent, functional abcb <dig> may still have been present in abcb <dig> knock-down embryos. rhodamine b efflux could, apart from abcb <dig>  be mediated also by other transporters that remain functional in abcb <dig> knock-down embryos, but are blocked by chemical inhibitors. there is, for example, indications that cyclosporin a and psc <dig>  apart from abcb, also block activity of abcc transporters of fish  <cit> . in addition to abcb <dig>  abcc transporters that have earlier been shown to be expressed in zebrafish embryos  <cit>  may play a role in rhodamine b efflux. however, our data indicate that the role of abcc transporters in efflux of rhodamine b is minor: mk <dig>  an inhibitor of mammalian abccs, has a comparatively small effect on rhodamine b efflux . in addition, the mk <dig> effect on rhodamine b accumulation may in fact be abcb <dig> inhibition as is indicated by our tests with mk <dig> and recombinant abcb <dig> . these results thus support that rhodamine b efflux in zebrafish embryos is majorly mediated by abcb <dig> and that abcb <dig> knock-down does not completely disrupt abcb <dig> function.

effects of other chemicals on rhodamine b efflux in zebrafish embryos
galaxolide, tonalide, phenanthrene, verapamil and vinblastine also caused increased accumulation of rhodamine b in  <dig> hpf zebrafish embryos in a concentration-dependent manner . the data confirm interaction of those compounds with the rhodamine b efflux mechanism in zebrafish embryos that, as we show here, is abcb <dig>  levels of rhodamine b in embryo tissue were significantly increased in zebrafish embryo tissue at concentrations ≥ <dig>  μm tonalide, ≥ <dig> μm phenanthrene and galaxolide, and ≥ <dig>  μm verapamil and vinblastine . galaxolide, tonalide and phenanthrene, which were included in the tests as ecotoxicologically relevant chemicals, were as effective as the inhibitors cyclosporin a and psc <dig> causing accumulation of approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  fmol rhodamine b per embryo, equivalent to  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold increases compared to the controls. galaxolide and tonalide, polycyclic musk compounds, have earlier been found to act as efflux transporter inhibiting chemosensitizers in marine bivalves  <cit> ; the data in this study indicate that the musks also affect the efflux of rhodamine b in zebrafish embryos, which appears to be conferred by abcb <dig> . the effect of verapamil, a potent inhibitor of mammalian abcb <dig>  was not as high as was found with the other abcb <dig> inhibitors, cyclosporin a and psc <dig>  the amount of rhodamine b was maximally  <dig> fmol per embryo, corresponding to a  <dig> -fold increase of rhodamine b accumulated in embryos with verapamil present . interestingly, however, our assays with recombinant protein indicated strong interaction of verapamil with abcb <dig> from zebrafish, suggesting that verapamil acts as a substrate of this transporter . being a substrate of the efflux transporter, verapamil may cause competitive inhibition of the transporter function and, therefore, its inhibitory potency depends on the degree of interference with another substrate  when both bind to the substrate binding site of the protein. thus, interference can be low if two compounds bind to different sites of the substrate binding site  <cit> . the discrepancy of comparatively weak inhibition of rhodamine b efflux and strong interaction with the transporter protein atpase by verapamil could thus be explained with little interference of the compounds when binding to the abcb <dig> binding site. all of the tested compounds interacted with recombinant abcb <dig> in the atpase assay  suggesting that their effect on rhodamine b accumulation in the embryos is associated with inhibition of the abcb4-mediated efflux activity of rhodamine b.

disruption of abcb <dig> activity leads to increased sensitivity of embryos to toxic transporter substrates
effects of abc transporter inhibitors on the mortality of embryos due to toxic compounds
we chose vinblastine, vincristine and doxorubicin, cytotoxic substrates of human abcb <dig>  <cit> , and phenanthrene as an ecotoxicologically relevant model compound, for determining to what extent chemical resistance of zebrafish embryos is associated with abc transporter efflux activity. in initial experiments that served to determine concentrations of the compounds that were toxic to zebrafish embryos we focused on the micromolar concentration range in which interaction of chemicals with transporters is generally observed. when embryos were exposed to the compounds from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf, we found lethal effects of vinblastine at concentrations > <dig> μm and 100% mortality at concentrations ≥ <dig> μm; of vincristine at concentrations ≥ <dig> μm; and of phenanthrene at concentrations > <dig> μm and 100% mortality at concentrations ≥ <dig> μm. within the concentration range tested , vincristine did not cause 100% mortality. toxicity of doxorubicin for zebrafish embryos appears to be low; we found no toxic effects for the compound at concentrations in the micromolar range and, indeed, lethal effects were reported for substantially higher concentrations  <cit> .

in further experiments that served to explore the role of transporter activity for the sensitivity of zebrafish embryos to toxic compounds, the test compounds were applied in a concentration series with two concentrations of vincristine  that were found to be toxic and for vinblastine and phenanthrene within the range causing up to 100% mortality in zebrafish embryos; doxorubicin was not further considered in these experiments. toxicities of vinblastine, vincristine and phenanthrene were compared when applied alone and in combination with the non-toxic concentration of  <dig> μm of the transporter inhibitor cyclosporin a and, in the case of vinblastine, as well with  <dig> μm psc <dig> 

in an experimental series with vinblastine and cyclosporin a, lc <dig> values  for vinblastine after exposure from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf were  <dig>  μm :  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm) without and  <dig>  μm  with cyclosporin a , which is a difference of  <dig> % . a similar decrease in lc <dig> for vinblastine was seen with psc <dig>  indicating higher toxicity of vinblastine when the transporter inhibitors were present. for testing whether the increase in vinblastine toxicity was indeed due to higher accumulations of the compound in the embryos, we studied uptake of bodipy-labeled, fluorescent vinblastine by embryos. fluorescence intensities were elevated in embryos treated with  <dig>  μm bodipy-vinblastine combined with cyclosporin a compared to embryos exposed to bodipy-vinblastine only . this indicates that accumulation of bodipy-vinblastine in the embryos depends on efflux transporter activity and confirms that higher vinblastine toxicity in the presence of inhibitors is due to reduced efflux and thus increased accumulation of the compound in the embryos.

as found for vinblastine, mortalities of embryos were significantly increased when vincristine and phenanthrene, respectively, were combined with  <dig> μm cyclosporin a, likewise indicating higher accumulation of those compounds in the embryos when cellular efflux activity is blocked . mortalities caused by  <dig> and  <dig> μm vincristine were increased by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold when cyclosporine was also present . cyclosporin a had a significant effect on the toxicity of phenanthrene, evidenced by a 37% difference between the lc <dig> values for phenanthrene alone  and with cyclosporine  .

effects of morpholino knock-down of abcb <dig> or abcb <dig> on vinblastine-caused mortalities in embryos
we furthermore examined the effect of disruption of transporter activity on resistance of embryos to vinblastine using morpholino knock-down. after  <dig> hours, exposure to  <dig> μm vinblastine caused 74% ±  <dig>  mortality in embryos upon knock-down of abcb <dig>  whereas abcb <dig> knock-down and control morpholino embryos showed mortalities  similar to untreated controls  . as with the abcb <dig> splice-blocking morpholino treated embryos, elevated sensitivity to vinblastine was also found for embryos treated with the abcb <dig> translation-blocking morpholino . the experiments with bodipy-vinblastine support the interpretation that stronger effects by vinblastine upon abcb <dig> knock-down are associated with increased vinblastine accumulation in the embryos. thus, as with cyclosporin a, the bodipy-vinblastine fluorescence in embryos was likewise increased when abcb <dig> knock-down embryos . when non-morpholino, control morpholino or abcb <dig> knock-down embryos were co-treated with cyclosporin a or psc <dig>  mortalities by  <dig> μm vinblastine were raised to similar levels as those in embryos with abcb <dig> knock-down without an inhibitor. the similar effects of abcb <dig> knock-down and of transporter inhibitor compounds indicate that abcb <dig> has a major role in mitigating vinblastine toxicity in zebrafish embryos and that the sensitivity-enhancing effect of the inhibitors, cyclosporin a and psc <dig>  is blocking activity of this transporter. the effect in treatments with abcb <dig> knock-down and inhibitors in combination tended to be slightly stronger than in treatments with only abcb <dig> knock-down or inhibitors . this can be seen as an indication that neither abcb <dig> knock-down nor treatment with the inhibitors at the concentration applied lead to complete suppression of abcb <dig> function, which is in concordance with the findings in the rhodamine dye accumulation experiments .

abcb <dig> substrates and inhibitors modulate the atpase activity of recombinant zebrafish abcb4
our results from the dye uptake and toxicological assays indicate that  zebrafish embryos employ a multidrug transporter like cellular efflux mechanism that blocks uptake of chemicals by the embryos from the water and thus mitigates their toxic effects;  this cellular efflux of compounds is largely based on the activity of abcb <dig>  but not of abcb5; and  effects of transporter inhibitors are associated with inhibition of abcb <dig> activity.

further evidence for interaction of the tested compounds with abcb <dig> as substrates and/or inhibitors comes from assays where effects of chemicals on the atpase activity of recombinant abcb <dig> protein were quantified. as a measure for interaction of chemicals with abcb <dig>  changes in atpase activity of recombinant abcb <dig> with the tested chemicals present were used . stimulation of the basal transporter atpase activity, indicated as the amount of inorganic phosphate  released during the hydrolysis of atp, occurs with compounds acting as substrates; inhibition of the stimulated atpase activity is found for transporter inhibitors  <cit> . for stimulation of abcb <dig> in the inhibition experiment and as a positive control we used verapamil, which stimulated the abcb <dig> atpase activity by  <dig> -fold . the action of verapamil on zebrafish abcb <dig> is comparable to its effect on the human abcb <dig> atpase activity, which is stimulated by  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold  <cit> .

stimulation of the basal abcb <dig> atpase activity
the compounds that were applied as fluorescent  or toxic  transporter substrates in experiments with the zebrafish embryos generally stimulated the basic abcb <dig> atpase activity  although the effect was statistically significant only for calcein-am . however, the pi levels were generally above baseline also with rhodamine b, vinblastine, vincristine and phenanthrene , which can be seen as an indication that these compounds also stimulated the abcb <dig> atpase activity, albeit to a lesser extent. doxorubicin stimulates the abcb <dig> atpase activity only at very high concentrations  <cit>  and, accordingly, the compound had no effect on the zebrafish abcb <dig> atpase activity in the concentration range we tested .

apart from the classic abcb <dig> inhibitor verapamil, the other tested inhibitors, cyclosporin a and psc <dig>  significantly and, in the case of mk <dig>  weakly, stimulated the abcb <dig> atpase activity . the atpase stimulating effect of cyclosporin a is consistent with its property as substrate of the mammalian abcb <dig>  <cit> , even though, in contrast to our results with abcb <dig>  the compound does not stimulate the abcb <dig> atpase  <cit> . interestingly, substantial abcb <dig> atpase stimulation was seen with tonalide and galaxolide, indicating their properties as abcb <dig> substrates . however, as the compounds are very lipophilic  <cit> , they probably highly accumulate in the cellular membranes and it is, therefore, questionable if abcb <dig> activity leads to efflux of the compounds from the cells.

activation of abcb <dig> atpase appeared in the nano- to low micro-molar concentration range of compounds corresponding to the concentrations applied in the dye uptake and toxicological assays with zebrafish embryos. this implies that these concentrations were in a range where the compounds are actively transported by abcb <dig> 

in the case of cyclosporin a, the concentration-dependent abcb <dig> atpase activity showed an initial increase in activity, followed by an activity decrease at higher concentrations . this biphasic response in atpase activities to increasing concentrations of a compound is common for substrates of human abcb <dig> and it is associated with the presence of two binding sites with different binding affinities in the protein, one for stimulation  and one for inhibition   <cit> . a decrease in atpase stimulation at higher concentrations was observed as a trend also for mk <dig>  vinblastine, galaxolide, tonalide and phenanthrene .

inhibition of the stimulated abcb <dig> atpase activity
except for rhodamine b , all of the tested compounds caused a decrease in the stimulated abcb <dig> atpase activity and the results are congruent with the sensitizing effects of cyclosporin a and psc <dig> in the embryotoxicity tests  and with the effects of cyclosporine a, psc <dig>  mk <dig>  vinblastine, tonalide, galaxolide and phenanthrene on rhodamine b accumulation in embryo tissue . for mk <dig>  which is an inhibitor of mammalian abcc <dig>  the inhibiting effect indicates that it also acts on zebrafish abcb <dig> and, as discussed above, its effects on rhodamine b accumulation in the zebrafish embryos may in fact be from inhibition of abcb <dig> in the embryos.

CONCLUSIONS
we here show that cellular efflux activity of an abcb <dig> ortholog in zebrafish embryos in the first  <dig> hours of development antagonizes uptake of chemicals from the water. this is evidenced by the finding that the presence of abc transporter inhibitors as well as morpholino knock-down of expression of functional abcb <dig> leads to increased accumulation of toxic and fluorescent transporter substrates in the embryos. atpase assays with recombinant zebrafish abcb <dig> confirm the properties of our test compounds as abcb <dig> substrates and/or inhibitors. since morpholino knock-down of abcb <dig> and exposure of embryos to chemical transporter inhibitors had similar effects on accumulation of substrates in the embryos it can be concluded that zebrafish abcb <dig> is a major component of the mxr system of zebrafish embryos.

this multixenobiotic resistance mediating function of the protein contrasts to mammalian abcb <dig>  which is a specialized translocator of phosphatidylcholine  into bile that transports cytotoxic drugs only at low rates and does not confer multixenobiotic resistance  <cit> . contrary to this, abcb <dig> in fish may not act as a pc translocator as is indicated by the lack of pc in the bile of the asian carp  <cit> , which, like zebrafish, is a cyprinid. the ability to transport a wide range of toxicants is probably a primary, ancient property of p-glycoproteins that is conserved for abcb <dig> in fish. this could explain why fish tolerate the absence of abcb <dig> since function as a toxicant pump is executed by the abcb <dig> ortholog. in adult zebrafish, abcb1-like efflux activity has been found to be a component of the blood-brain barrier  <cit> . as abcb <dig> is absent in zebrafish, this efflux activity may well be associated with the function of the abcb <dig> ortholog.

abcb <dig>  the other p-glycoprotein in zebrafish, appears not to mediate xenobiotic resistance.

the abcb4-mediated efflux activity of toxicants in zebrafish embryos, a major pharmacologic and toxicologic model system, has important implications: 1) abcb <dig> activity can substantially determine bioavailability - and thus pharmacologic and toxicologic potency - of a diverse array of chemicals to zebrafish embryos; 2) chemicals that modulate abcb <dig> activity, such as the chemical transporter inhibitors we used, will enhance bioavailability of chemicals to zebrafish embryos that are usually effluxed by abcb <dig>  this chemosensitization by efflux transporter inhibition can be caused by a variety of chemicals, including seemingly innocuous ones  <cit> . the polycyclic musk compounds galaxolide and tonalide are an example for such compounds as they do not exert obvious toxic effects on zebrafish embryo development  <cit> , but they clearly act as potent abcb <dig> inhibitors. our data underscore that efflux transporters are underappreciated but are important determinants of bioavailability of chemicals to cells and organisms. on the other hand, chemicals can reverse transporter function and thus increase bioavailability of other compounds. depending on efflux transporter interference with different compounds, bioavailability of compounds in a mixture can deviate from that of the same components when they are present alone. this suggests that current regulatory practice of assessing risks based on individual compounds may underestimate toxicity. in this context, our baculovirus-based abcb <dig> activity assay has proven reliable to determine substrate/inhibitor properties of test compounds and will be useful in chemical screens using zebrafish.
