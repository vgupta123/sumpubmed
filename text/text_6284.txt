BACKGROUND
bacterial expression systems enjoy great popularity because of their well-characterized genetics, availability of "taylor-made" cloning vectors as well as hosts, and ability to grow rapidly on inexpensive substrates. these systems are frequently used to construct cell factories for the expression of homologous or heterologous proteins and many industrial production strains were prepared in this way.

penicillin g acylase  is an excellent example of the commercially valuable enzyme for which a large number of bacterial expression systems was developed  <cit> .

the pgas of e. coli, arthrobacter viscosus, providencia rettgeri, kluyvera citrophila, bacillus megaterium and alcaligenes faecalis have been described  <cit>  and studied in details regarding the production of β-lactam nuclei by n-deacylation of penicillin g or deacetoxycephalosporin g. the same pgas can be used as potential catalysts for the kinetically controlled synthesis of semi-synthetic antibiotics such as ampicillin, amoxicillin, cephalexin, or cefadroxil from the β-lactam nucleus and appropriate activated acyl donor. the efficiency of the synthetic process is generally quantified by the ratio of the rates for the synthetic reaction and hydrolysis of activated acyl donor : the enzymes with higher value of this parameter are more convenient for a synthetic use  <cit> .

experimental data on the expression of pga gene and posttranslational processing of pga were obtained predominantly from studies on the pgas of enterobacteria: the enzyme accumulates in the periplasmic space as a heterodimer and, to become a mature, properly folded enzyme, the precursor peptide has to undergo rather complex processing. the pga precursor is an inactive prepropeptide that consists of a signal  peptide and a propeptide  separating α and β-subunits. processing of the enzyme precursor in e. coli begins in the cytoplasm where the β-subunit is released by intra-molecular autocatalytic cleavage  <cit> . the signal sequence of the precursor is cleaved upon crossing the cytoplasmic membrane which is followed by an intermolecular, sequential removing of the propeptide generating the c-terminus of the α-subunit  <cit> . the pga from gram-positive bacteria such as b. megaterium or a. viscosus is secreted to the growth medium  <cit> .

the expression system based on the methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris is another excellent cell factory based on eukaryotic microorganism: the system competes with the prokaryotic one in many aspects, e.g., stable genomic integration of the recombinant expression cassette, high-cell density cultivation, and efficient secretion of the product  <cit> . although the system is predominantly used as a secretory system, efficient cytosolic expression can be achieved. the data on the intracellular expression of bacterial proteins are scarce  <cit> . in the case of prokaryotic esterase of lactobacillus casei, cytosolic expression in pichia was found to be superior to a prokaryotic expression system: the expression of the esterase was as much as 50-fold higher in p. pastoris x- <dig> than in e. coli bl <dig>  <cit> .

the pga of e. coli was expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae: the pga gene was cloned on a multicopy plasmid and the enzyme was secreted to the medium in small amounts  <cit> . the pga from p. rettgeri secreted by the same host was partially o-glycosylated at the α-subunit  <cit> . this pga was also cloned and expressed in p. pastoris  <cit> . the secreted enzyme was entirely n-glycosylated, functional, and exhibited higher thermostability  <cit> . the extracellular production in a stirred bioreactor reached the volumetric and specific activities of  <dig> u l- <dig> and  <dig> u mgprotein- <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

so far, the only way of preparation of pga for industrial use is the expression of the enzyme in prokaryotic hosts. the production capacity for non-glycosylated prokaryotic pga in pichia cytosol could be higher but so far this approach has not yet been used.

we have cloned the leader-less gene encoding pga from e. coli  under the control of aox <dig> promoter in p. pastoris x- <dig>  intracellular expression of the gene was studied in a stirred bioreactor in a high-cell density culture under different profiles of the transient phase applied in the fed-batch process. the heterologous pgaec  was purified, characterized and compared with the wild-type pgaec regarding propeptide processing, substrate specificity, physico-chemical traits, kinetic parameters, and kinetically controlled synthesis of β-lactam antibiotics.

RESULTS
cloning of the leader-less pga gene
the structural gene for pgaec , including stop codon) encodes the preproprotein with  <dig> amino acids . chromosomal dna from the strain e. coli re <dig> was used in pcr reactions to obtain the leader-less pga gene starting from the 79th bp after atg triplet. in order to express the pga gene in p. pastoris x- <dig>  the upstream pcr primer contained a yeast consensus sequence  followed with the first triplet of the α-subunit. this construct was inserted into the ppicz-a under the control of aox <dig> promoter and the plasmid was used to transform the host p. pastoris x- <dig>  zeor clones identified on selective plates were cultured in shake flasks with methanol and tested for the pga activity: among  <dig> clones with mut+ phenotype,  <dig> isolates expressed elevated amounts of the pga ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  u ml- <dig> after  <dig> h of induction. the mut+ isolate with the highest activity was designated as p. pastoris x- <dig> and selected for further work.

high-cell density culture
the expression of leader-less pga gene of e. coli by eukaryotic system of p. pastoris x- <dig> was studied in a standard, four phase process in a stirred bioreactor. to evaluate the maximum synthetic capacity of the yeast system for the intracellular expression of hpgaec, a transient phase of the process was optimized .

four experiments were designed: the cultures with transient profile i  where continuous induction with methanol  was accompanied with linear drop of glycerol feeding to zero; the cultures with the profile ii  in which the cultures were starved for glycerol for two hours, and the induction was started with the dose of methanol  at the end of the transient phase. in all experiments, the feeding rate of methanol at the methanol feed phase was controlled by dissolved oxygen concentration: the process values of po <dig> ranged from  <dig> to 30%.

samples were taken at regular intervals and the courses of the culture parameters  and calculated average final parameters of the cultures are shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> 

tp profile - transient phase profile: i - linear feeding of methanol, linear decrease of glycerol feeding, ii - starvation for glycerol; methanol supplemented at the end of the transient phase in a single dose. methanol - final concentration at the beginning of methanol feeding phase. *  means the hour at which maximal volumetric activity was achieved. average volumetric activity - volumetric activity calculated from the last three values of activity assay. induction time - time of growth on methanol required to achieve the average activity.

the highest specific productivities of the hpgaec  <dig>  and  <dig>  u gcdw- <dig> h- <dig> were achieved in the experiments b and c, respectively: the inducer concentration in these cultures equalled  <dig> %. in addition, the highest average volumetric activity  and specific activity  were reached in the experiment b .

purification of pga from e. coli and p. pastoris and determination of authenticity of the heterologous product
to characterize both pgas, we purified the wild type pga from the strain e. coli re <dig> and hpgaec from p. pastoris x- <dig>  the pgaec from the prokaryotic host was purified by a purification process consisting of the disintegration of cells, preparation of crude enzyme solution, fractional precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. the yield of the activity was 20%, the enzyme was purified 29-fold and had the activity of  <dig>  u mgprotein- <dig>  purity control of the isolated pgaec by sds-page electrophoresis revealed two protein bands with molecular weights corresponding to α and β-subunits. calculated molecular weights from maldi-tof ms data of pgaec were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda for α and β-subunits, respectively, and corresponded to theoretical values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda .

to isolate the hpgaec from p. pastoris x- <dig>  crude enzyme solution was prepared by disintegration of the biomass from the fed-batch experiment b. the inhibitors of proteases in the course of hpgaec purification were used to exclude any further non-specific proteolysis of the enzyme.

sds-page gel analysis after each purification step showed that the enzyme was sufficiently pure after the purification step on deae fractogel. the enzyme was purified 26-fold with an overall activity yield of 46% and had the activity of  <dig>  u mgprotein- <dig>  sds-page gel electrophoresis revealed presence of two forms of the α-subunit: α <dig>  and α <dig> . molecular weights calculated from maldi-tof ms data were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda for α <dig>  α <dig>  and β-subunit, respectively .

comparison of maldi-tof ms analysis of tryptic digests of the α-subunit from e. coli and α <dig>  α2-subunits from p. pastoris x- <dig> revealed differences in primary structures: the c-terminus of the α2-subunit extends to the amino acid residue a <dig> of the spacer peptide  and the c-terminus of the α <dig> extends to k <dig> of the spacer . the c-terminus of the α-subunit from pgaec is formed by a <dig>  the n-terminus was investigated according to the modified protocol based on the use of the reagent 4-sulfophenyl-isothiocyanate  before protein separation by sds-page electrophoresis. analysis of the labelled n-terminus confirmed that the terminuses of α <dig> and α2-subunits of hpgaec start with methionine which is missing in the mature form of pgaec. as regards the β-subunits of pgaec and hpgaec, they were identical.

physico-chemical and kinetic parameters of pgaec and hpgaec
hydrolytic activities of both purified pgas were determined with penicillin g, penicillin v, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cephalexin, 6-nitro-3-phenylacetylamidobenzoic acid , and phenylacetamide . it is evident that the enzymes differ in the substrate specificity: in terms of a hydrolytic activity ratio, they have the same values for penicillin v, ampicillin or amoxicillin to penicillin g. the increased ratio of the hydrolysis of cephalexin, phenylacetamide or nipab to penicillin g was observed with hpgaec and the value ranged from 50%  to 200% .

stability of the hydrolytic activity , temperature optimum and ph optimum of the enzyme were determined for both enzymes with penicillin g as the reaction substrate. it was found that pgaec exhibited high stability in the range of ph from  <dig> to  <dig> , while hpgaec is stable only in the range of ph from  <dig> to  <dig>  the activity of the heterologous enzyme dropped by 15-20% at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . the remaining activity of 50% was assayed at ph values  <dig> and  <dig> 

the effect of the temperature on the stability of the enzymes was studied in the range of temperatures from  <dig> to 70°c. both enzymes were stable up to 40°c. at higher pre-incubation temperatures, the remaining activities of both enzymes fell down rapidly.

determination of the ph and temperature optima suggested that the temperature and ph optimum for the hydrolytic activity of pgaec and hpgaec were 55°c, ph  <dig>  and 50°c, ph  <dig> , respectively.

the kinetic parameters were determined with the natural substrate penicillin g and chromogenic substrate nipab. the initial reaction rate of the hydrolysis of the substrate was measured in the range of substrate concentrations: 5- <dig> μm for penicillin g and 7- <dig> μm for nipab. the values of km, kcat and vmax of pgaec and hpgaec are shown in table  <dig> 

to check if the aberrant processing of hpgaec could result in improved traits of the enzyme in syntheses of β-lactam antibiotics, kinetically controlled syntheses of cephalexin, amoxicillin and ampicillin catalyzed by both purified pgas were carried out at ph  <dig>  and 30°c. we found that the s/h ratios for the enzymatic formation of cephalexin by pgaec and hpgaec were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. both enzymes pgaec and hpgaec have similar s/h ratios for the synthesis of ampicillin from 6-aminopenicillanic acid  and d-phenylglycine amide , and amoxicillin from 6-apa and d-p-hydroxyphenylglycine amide .

discussion
at present, production strains for pga used in industry are mainly the recombinant strains of e. coli based on a homologous cloning of the genes: the same microorganism is used as the pga gene donor and the host for the recombinant plasmid. the finding that penicillin acylases may also catalyze syntheses of β-lactam antibiotics  started the search for "novel" or "improved" penicillin acylases with more convenient traits for these synthetic applications  <cit> . the development of the eukaryotic expression system based on p. pastoris and "bio-sourcing" of the genes from the environmental dna revealed an underestimated aspect of the expression of the cloned gene in a foreign host: an authenticity of the heterologous protein.

to evaluate the production potential of p. pastoris x- <dig> for intracellularly expressed pgaec, the leader-less pga gene was integrated into the chromosome of p. pastoris x- <dig> and the mut+ strain p. pastoris x- <dig> was constructed. the gene was not adapted to p. pastoris codon usage and its intracellular expression induced with methanol was studied in a stirred bioreactor in high-cell density cultures. the effect of the profile of the transient phase of the fed-batch culture on penicillin acylase production was selected as the parameter for the optimization of the fermentation process. it can be concluded that the change of glycerol to methanol utilization during the transient phase had a marked effect on the volumetric activity and specific productivity of the culture: a continuous decrease of glycerol accompanied with linear increase of the methanol concentration  resulted in the highest values of both parameters.

when the production capacity for the homologous pgaec was studied in a fed-batch culture of the recombinant e. coli, the specific activity of about  <dig> u gcdw - <dig> was reached  <cit>  which corresponded to the volumetric activity of about 14000- <dig> u l- <dig>   <cit> . in our experiments, the volumetric activity of hpgaec expressed in p. pastoris x- <dig> after induction with  <dig> % methanol reached higher level and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> u l- <dig>  however, the specific activity was lower in comparison with the bacterial culture.

the finding that the activity of the purified enzyme hpgaec is low  was surprising. considering the pattern of the subunit bands on sds gel, we have concluded that hpgaec is not correctly maturated in the cytosol of p. pastoris x- <dig> and the enzyme is a mixture of two isoforms in the ratio  <dig> to  <dig>  as expected, we have proved by deglycosylation experiment , that no n-glycosylation occurred as it was described for the secreted enzyme of p. rettgeri in p. pastoris gs <dig>  <cit> . the authors reported  <dig> types of the β-subunit and  <dig> forms of the α-subunit: while the β-subunit was glycosylated to a different extent , two bands of the α-subunit were formed due to non-specific proteolysis at the n-terminus of the subunit. however, the c-terminus of the smaller subunit was not analyzed.

in our case, different processing occurred in the cytosol at this very terminus. amino acid sequence analysis of the n- and c-terminuses confirmed that the β-subunits of pgaec and hpgaec are identical and that the first step of the precursor maturation, an autocatalytic cleavage between the spacer peptide and β-subunit, occurs correctly in the cytosol. this finding is in agreement with autocatalytic intracellular processing and the n-terminus formation of the β-subunit found in prokaryotes  <cit> .

at present, we have no piece of evidence if the host- or non-specific proteolysis is involved in processing of the hpgaec precursor consisting of the α-subunit and propeptide. it is known that the α-subunit of pga is responsible for the substrate specificity of the enzyme  <cit> . modified primary structures of the α-subunits can explain the lower activity of purified hpgaec expressed in the cytosol of p. pastoris x-33: the α-subunits start with methionine and their c-terminuses extend to a <dig> of the spacer peptide  or k <dig> .

in terms of biosynthetic potential of the cell for the properly matured enzyme, the volumetric activity and specific activity of hpgaec would correspond to about  <dig> u l- <dig> and  <dig> u gcdw- <dig>  respectively, because the ratio of the activity of purified pgaec to hpgaec equals about two.

a presence of several mature forms of the periplasmic pga from a. faecalis expressed in e. coli was also described  <cit>  and the results were discussed in terms of the conversion of the n-terminal glutamine to pyrrolidone carboxylic acid and the loss of three aa from the c-terminus of the α-subunit.

it is evident , that heterologous expression of pga may yield a mature enzyme with modified primary structure and traits.

a hydrolysis of selected substrates is an important parameter for evaluation of any changes in the substrate specificity of the heterologous enzyme that may have occurred at the expression in a given host. the hpgaec has got higher affinity to cephalexin , phenylacetamide and nipab . there was no change in the enzyme affinity to the substrates containing 6-apa moiety. regarding the kinetic parameters determined with the natural substrate penicillin g, aberrant maturing of hpgaec resulted in lower km, vmaxand kcat.

compared to the properly matured enzyme, the s/h ratio of hpgaec for the synthesis of cephalexin was increased by 50%. improvement of pga traits as regards the synthesis of cephalexin was described for a chimeric penicillin acylase. after shuffling of the pga genes of e. coli, p. rettgeri and k. cryogenes, the mutant enzyme displayed a 40% higher synthetic activity than the wild type enzyme of p. rettgeri  <cit> .

the ph and temperature stabilities of both enzymes are comparable with literature data  <cit>  and the heterologous expression in p. pastoris x <dig> system has no marked effect on these parameters.

CONCLUSIONS
the prokaryotic, leader-less gene encoding pgaec under the control of aox <dig> promoter can be efficiently expressed in the cytosol of the yeast p. pastoris x- <dig>  the activity of the mature enzyme equals  <dig>  u mgprotein- <dig> and this value corresponds to 49% of the pgaec activity. it was shown that the precursor of hpgaec was processed aberrantly and the enzyme exhibited improved traits for the synthesis of cephalexin, a β-lactam antibiotic containing 7-adca moiety. no improvement was observed in syntheses of the antibiotics derived from 6-apa. the understanding on structure/function relationships of the aberrantly processed or engineered propeptide of a penicillin acylase could be applicable to modify the traits of the enzyme.
