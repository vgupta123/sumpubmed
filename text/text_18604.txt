BACKGROUND
bacterial spot disease of tomato and pepper presents a serious agricultural problem worldwide, leading to significant crop losses especially in regions with warm and humid climate. the disease is characterized by necrotic lesions on leaves, sepals and fruits, reducing yield and fruit quality  <cit> . the disease is caused by a relatively diverse set of bacterial strains within the genus xanthomonas; strain nomenclature and classification for the strains that infect pepper and tomato have gone through considerable taxonomic revision in recent years. currently, the pathogens are classified into four distinct pathogen groups  within the genus xanthomonas. strains belonging to groups a, b and d infect both tomato and pepper. group c strains are pathogenic only on tomato  <cit> . these phenotypically and genotypically distinct strains have different geographic distributions. strains of group a and b are found worldwide. c strains have been increasingly found in the u.s., mexico, brazil, korea and regions bordering the indian ocean, and d group strains are found in the former yugoslavia, canada, costa rica, u.s, brazil and regions of the indian ocean  <cit> . three of the four groups except for d were originally described as a single pathovar within xanthomonas campestris and referred to as x. campestris pv. vesicatoria. the d group consisted of a strain isolated from tomato that had been designated 'pseudomonas gardneri' for many years  <cit>  although de ley provided evidence for placement in the genus xanthomonas  <cit> . subsequently all four groups were classified as separate species on the basis of physiological and molecular characteristics as follows: xanthomonas euvesicatoria , xanthomonas vesicatoria , xanthomonas perforans , and xanthomonas gardneri   <cit> .

based on 16s rrna analysis, x. euvesicatoria strain 85- <dig>  and x. perforans  together form a monophyletic group, whereas x. vesicatoria  and x. gardneri  cluster together with x. campestris pv. campestris  xcc strain  <dig>  <cit> . recently, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on mlst  data for a, b, c and d group strains and other xanthomonads  <cit> . the mlst approach revealed that x. euvesicatoria and x. perforans form a group along with x. citri strain  <dig> . x. gardneri is most closely related to x. campestris pv. campestris strains while x. vesicatoria forms a distinct clade  <cit> . this diversity among the four groups makes the xanthomonas-tomato/pepper system an excellent example to study pathogen co-evolution, as distinct species have converged on a common host.

while integrated management approaches for control of bacterial spot disease are available, the development of host resistance is more economical and environmentally benign for the control of the disease  <cit> . host resistance may also be required to replace the loss of some integrated management tools. use of copper and streptomycin sprays over the years, for example, has led to the development of resistant strains  <cit> . at the same time, genetic resistance has been lost due to race shifts in pathogen populations  <cit> . designing new and possibly durable resistance requires knowledge of pathogenicity factors possessed by the four groups.

many candidate pathogenicity factors have been identified in strains of xanthomonas. a number of virulence factors are employed by xanthomonads to gain entry into leaf or fruit tissue, and gain access to nutrients, while simultaneously overcoming or suppressing plant defenses. different secretion systems and their effectors have been shown to contribute to the virulence of plant pathogens. the type iii secretion system  encoded by the hrp  gene cluster  <cit>  and type iii secreted effectors have been widely studied for their role in hypersensitivity and pathogenicity. effectors common between strains are believed to be responsible for conserved virulence function and avoidance of host defense. differences in effector suites have evolved in closely related strains of plant pathogens and strain-specific effectors may help to escape recognition by host-specific defenses  <cit> . important insights into pathogenicity mechanisms of x. euvesicatoria strain 85- <dig>  have been obtained with its genome sequence  <cit> . here we report draft genome sequences of type strains of the other three bacterial spot pathogen species: x. vesicatoria strain  <dig>  , x. perforans strain 91- <dig> , and x. gardneri strain  <dig>  . we have annotated and analyzed predicted pathogenicity factors in the draft genomes. additionally, we have investigated differentiation between xanthomonads that might explain differences in disease phenotypes and in host range.

RESULTS
draft genome sequences of xv strain  <dig>  xp strain 91- <dig> and xg strain  <dig> were obtained by combining roche- <dig>  and illumina ga <dig>  sequencing data
initially, we sequenced xv strain  <dig>  , xp strain 91- <dig>  and xg strain  <dig>   by  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> . de novo assembly using newbler assembler resulted in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contigs, respectively, for xv, xp and xg, with approximately 10-fold coverage for each strain . many pathogenicity genes, including type iii effectors, existed in the form of fragments given the relatively low coverage of the 454-based assembly. more complete assemblies were obtained using illumina sequencing  <cit> . de novo assemblies of around 100-fold coverage were constructed from the illumina data alone or combined with pre-assembled  <dig> long reads using clc genomic workbench  <cit> . combined  <dig> and illumina sequencing produced a much better assembly than either technology alone . therefore, combined assemblies were chosen for all subsequent analyses. the average contig size in the combined  <dig> and illumina assemblies was around  <dig> kb for xv and xp, and  <dig> kb for xg. the n <dig>  values were  <dig> and  <dig> for xv and xp, respectively, and  <dig> for xg indicating that final assemblies consist of a few large contigs allowing reasonably accurate whole genome comparisons.

*n <dig> - number of contigs that cover 50% of the genome assembly.

the three strains were deduced to contain plasmids as evidenced by the presence of genes that are known to be involved in plasmid maintenance . we have used adjacency to such genes to infer occurrence of certain other genes on plasmids.

relationships of the strains to other xanthomonads using whole genome comparisons
16s rrna analysis and mlst-based phylogenetic analysis showed the diversity among the four bacterial spot species. we carried out phylogenetic analysis based on orthologous protein-coding genes from draft genomes and reference xanthomonads . whole genome comparisons were performed using the mumi index  <cit>  to assess pairwise distance between the draft genomes and available reference xanthomonas genomes as shown in the phylogenetic tree and the distance matrix . another program, dnadiff, based on nucmer  <cit>  showed the extent of homologies among the shared regions of the genomes by pairwise comparisons . all of the methods yielded consistent results: we were able to ascertain that among the three newly sequenced strains in relationship to the previously sequenced strains, xp and xcv form the closest pair, which is in turn closest to xac. next, xg is closest to xcc, with xv forming a clade with xg and the xcc species group .

four xanthomonads show variation in the organization of the type iii secretion gene clusters
annotation of the respective type iii secretion gene clusters, or hrp genes showed that xp has an almost identical and syntenic hrp cluster to that of xcv . the most notable difference is that hpag and hpaf encode the fusion protein xopae in xp, while they are present as separate genes in xcv. adjacent hypothetical protein xcv <dig>  is absent from xp. xv and xg show greater similarity to the core hrp cluster genes of xcc than to that of xcv. xv and xg contain hrpw associated with the hrp cluster as in xcc. additionally, xopd in xv and xg is not associated with the hrp cluster as in xcc . psva shows 74% and 84% sequence identity to the respective homologs from xv and xg. xopa  from xcv seems to be absent from xv and xg. interestingly, we found a novel candidate effector gene  upstream of hrpw in xv and xg . finally, the hrp-associated effector xopf <dig> is conserved and intact in all four tomato and pepper pathogens.

a reporter gene assay confirms translocation of novel type iii effectors
we identified and annotated t3ss effectors from the three newly sequenced xanthomonads . several candidate effectors, which had not yet been experimentally confirmed in xanthomonads, and candidate effectors with plausible translocation motifs were identified . corroborative evidence for t3ss-mediated translocation of the candidate effectors was assessed by constructing fusion genes with the c-terminal end of avrbs <dig> coding sequence  in a race  <dig> strain of x. euvesicatoria. translocation was measured in pepper cv. ecw 20r, containing the resistance gene bs <dig> . genes xopao, xopg, xopam, and xga_ <dig> , of which homologs were previously found in pseudomonas species, were demonstrated to direct avrbs2-specific hypersensitive reactions in ecw 20r . another candidate effector gene xopz <dig>  associated with the hrp clusters in xv and xg , was also functional in the avrbs2-based assay. thus, we identified five effectors  that have not been previously recognized in xanthomonas and showed their functionality.

*xv and xg contain effector xopz <dig> belonging to the same family xopz.

core effectors among four xanthomonads give insight into infection strategies of the pathogen
comparing the draft genome sequences of the three xanthomonads with that of xcv allowed us to identify the core effectors conserved in all four strains as well as strain-specific effectors .

at least  <dig> effector genes form a core set of common effectors for xanthomonads infecting tomato and pepper . of these  <dig>  eight effector genes  were found to be conserved in all sequenced xanthomonads including the three draft genomes presented here with the exceptions of x. albilineans and x. campestris pv. armoraciae. these genes might be necessary for maintaining pathogenicity of these xanthomonads in a wide range of host plants. xopn has been reported to suppress pamp -triggered immunity by interacting with tomato tark <dig> and tft <dig>  <cit> . xopf <dig> is conserved in tomato and pepper xanthomonads. although a homolog of xopf <dig> is found in xcc, the respective gene is truncated  <cit> . hence, xopf <dig> is a potential pathogenicity determinant in tomato. a xopf <dig> deletion mutant of xcv did not show any difference in virulence when compared to wild type xcv on the susceptible cultivar of pepper ecw, suggesting xopf <dig> is not the lone factor for pathogenicity of xcv on pepper  <cit> . another effector gene, xopd, is associated with the hrp gene cluster in xcv and xp. however, xopd appears to have translocated to another location in the genome in case of xg, xv and xcc strains. xopd is annotated as "psv virulence protein" in xcc genome  <cit>  and has been shown to be a chimeric protein sharing a c terminus with xopd from xcv  <cit> . although xopd homologs from xv and xg are syntenic with the psv gene in xcc, xv and xg have intact full-length copies of xopd as in xcv, indicating that the xopd could be another effector exclusive to the tomato pathogens and a possible pathogenicity determinant in tomato. xopd has been shown to enhance pathogen survival in tomato leaves by delaying symptom development  <cit> . two tandem copies of xopx are found in xg. however, one gene in xg appears to be inactive due to a frameshift mutation. in xp, the two copies of xopx are found in different locations in the genome with neighboring genes, including chaperone gene groel, which is also duplicated. orthologs of xopz are also found in all four xanthomonads, with 82% identity for xcv and xp and 35% identity for xg and xv. apart from low sequence identity in xv and xg, gene-specific rearrangements appear to have occurred within each ortholog. we propose that the overall low amino acid relatedness  of this effector in xv and xg warrants assigning the proteins to a new family within the xopz class, named xopz <dig>  while the orthologs from xcv and xp belong to family of xopz <dig> as originally described in xoo and as supported by pairwise sequence identities of at least 60% .

effectors unique to xp might be responsible for restricting growth on pepper
xp is pathogenic only on tomato. the avirulence gene, avrxv <dig>  present in xp, was previously shown to elicit an hypersensitive response  in pepper cv. ecw  <cit> . an avrxv <dig> knockout mutant of xp is not virulent in pepper cv. ecw indicating that other factors are associated with host specificity. comparing effector repertoires of the pepper pathogens xg, xcv, and xv with xp may provide clues to the factors that are responsible for reduced virulence . besides avrxv <dig>  the only effectors present in xp and absent or inactive in xg, xv and xcv are xopc <dig>  xopae and xopj <dig>  . the gene avrxv <dig> is absent from other sequenced xanthomonads and shows gene-for-gene interaction with the xv <dig> resistance gene from the wild tomato relative solanum pennellii but does not contribute to restricted growth of xp on pepper  <cit> . the effector xopc <dig> is a homolog of the effector rsp <dig> from ralstonia solanacearum gmi <dig> and xopae encodes an lrr protein with homology to the r. solanacearum effector popc. both genes, xopc <dig> and xopae, are truncated in xcv. therefore, these two effectors may trigger immunity in pepper. interestingly, xp contains a paralog of xopp. the two copies are found next to each other in the genome and share 75% identity at the amino acid level. the second copy is next to the candidate effector xopc <dig>  which is unique to xp among tomato and pepper pathogens. effectors xopc <dig> and xopp may both act to restrict growth in pepper. moreover, there are at least two effectors, xope <dig> and xopg, present in the pepper pathogens xcv, xv and xg but absent from xp. these effectors may be essential pathogenicity factors in pepper.

species-specific effectors
xv possesses two unique effector genes, xopag  and xopai . a phylogenetic analysis of xopag showed that xopag from xv is closely related to xopag from x. citri aw, which has been shown to be responsible for causing an hr on grapefruit  <cit> . xopai is a chimeric protein, which contains a conserved myristoylation motif at its n terminus, like xopj <dig>  this effector class also includes the homolog xac <dig> from xac as well as xaub_ <dig> and xauc_ <dig> from x. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii strains b and c, respectively  <cit> . the presence of transposons and phage elements in close proximity helps to explain the evolution of this novel effector in xac by terminal reassortment  <cit> . xv also contains effector gene avrbst, which is responsible for the hypersensitive response on pepper. loss of the plasmid containing avrbst in xcv strain 75- <dig> allows the strain to cause disease on pepper  <cit> .

xg contains at least two effectors, avrhah <dig>  and xopb as does xcv, and share sequence identity of 82% and 86% respectively to the corresponding effectors of xcv. however, avrhah <dig> appears to specify a different phenotype when compared to avrbs <dig> from xcv. avrhah <dig> was shown to be responsible for increased watersoaking on pepper ecw-50r and 60r, whereas xcv strains carrying avrbs <dig> show a phenotype that consists of small raised fleck lesions on pepper  <cit> . another effector gene, xopb, has a pip box at the 5' end in xcv, whereas the homolog in xg does not contain a pip box. neighboring genes to xopb in the respective strains are completely different between genomes, suggesting lack of synteny between the two species in this region . xopb from xg is 92% identical at the amino acid level to the homolog in xcv. deletion mutants of xopb from xcv did not show any difference in virulence, indicating it does not contribute significantly to virulence  <cit> . however, xopb may contribute to virulence in xg. we also identified eight effector genes that are unique to xcv . with the exception of xopaa , all of these genes belong to regions of low gc content compared to average genome gc content : avrbs <dig> , xopc <dig> , xopj <dig>  , xopj <dig>  , xopo , xopaj  .

few effectors are shared among phylogenetically related group strains
although xp and xcv, and xv and xg form distinct phylogenetic groups , relatively few effectors are shared between these species. for xp and xcv, they share at least six effectors - xope <dig>  xopf <dig>  xopp, xopv, xopak, xopap, which are absent from the other two genomes . xv and xg appear to be most closely related to strains of x. campestris pv. campestris, and this relationship is reflected in the suite of effector genes. in fact, xg and xv share four effector genes with xcc, namely, xopam, avrxcca <dig>  hrpw and xopz <dig>  with the caveat that hrpw and avrxcca <dig> may not function as intracellular effectors . furthermore, the genomic regions containing these genes are syntenic in xg, xv and xcc.

x. gardneri shows evidence of effector acquisition by horizontal gene transfer
effector homologs of avra, hopas <dig> and avrrpm <dig> from p. syringae pv. tomato t <dig> and p. syringae pv. syringae b728a are found in xg with 79%, 41% and 61% identity at the amino acid level, respectively . other x. gardneri strains also contain these effectors based on pcr screening . these three effectors, xga_ <dig> , xga_0764/xga_ <dig>  and xga_ <dig> , are unique to x. gardneri. the c terminal region of xga_ <dig> shows 53% identity to avrbs <dig> from xcv. hence according to the xanthomonas effector nomenclature  <cit> , xga_ <dig> from xg was placed under the class avrbs <dig>  xga_0764/xga_ <dig> and xga_ <dig> have not yet been reported to be found in xanthomonads and were assigned to new classes xopas and xopao. x. gardneri strains have been found to be associated with tomato and have a lower optimum temperature for disease development similar to that of pathovars of pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . a high score by alien_hunter analysis  <cit> , along with very low gc content  and the proximity of mobile genetic elements provides evidence for horizontal gene transfer . effector xopas appears to be separated into two orfs xga_ <dig> and xga_ <dig> by internal stop codon. the functionality of effector xopas needs to be confirmed by in planta reporter gene assay. avra of p. syringae pv. tomato pt <dig> was shown to contribute to virulence on tomato plants  <cit> . acquisition of xga_ <dig> by xg might have conferred increased virulence on tomato. avrrpm <dig> from p. syringae pv. syringae possesses a myristoylation motif, which is absent from homologs in xg. this modification in xg might have been acquired to escape host recognition. another candidate effector gene, xopaq, in xg is found  <dig> bps downstream of a perfect pip box. the gene shows 65% identity at the amino acid level to rip6/ <dig>  a novel effector from r. solanacearum rs <dig>  <cit> .

all four xanthomonads contain ax <dig> coding gene but only xcv contains a functional sulfation gene
the ax <dig>  gene is conserved among xanthomonas species and is predicted to encode a type i-secreted protein that may serve as a quorum sensing signaling molecule  <cit> . a 17-amino acid sulfated peptide from the n-terminal region of xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  ax <dig>  was shown to bind and activate the xa <dig> receptor kinase from rice, demonstrating that ax <dig> is a conserved pamp that can activate plant immune signaling  <cit> . the ax <dig> gene is present in xcv , xp , xv , and xg . the axys <dig> peptide is 100% conserved in xcv, xp and xv, while in xg there is a change from leucine to isoleucine at residue 20; this is unlikely to alter the activity of the peptide, since changing this residue to alanine had no effect on recognition by xa <dig>  <cit> .

recognition of axys <dig> by the xa <dig> receptor requires sulfation of tyrosine  <dig>  which requires the putative sulfotransferase raxst. in contrast to ax <dig>  the raxst gene is more variable in these genomes, which is consistent with a report of sequence differences in this gene among xoo strains  <cit> . furthermore, in xp, there is a single-nucleotide insertion at position  <dig>  causing a frameshift mutation. the xv and xg genomes do not contain raxst; therefore, the ax <dig> gene products may be nonfunctional in these strains. these findings have implications for the further study of the role of ax <dig> in quorum sensing and virulence, as well as for the usefulness of the xa <dig> receptor to confer resistance to xanthomonads in crop plants.

two type ii secretion systems are conserved in all four xanthomonas genomes
most cell-wall degrading enzymes, such as cellulases, polygalacturonases, xylanases, and proteases, are secreted by a type ii secretion system . the xps t2ss, present in all xanthomonads, has been studied for its contribution to virulence in xcc and xoo  <cit> . another t2ss cluster, known as the xcs system, is found only in certain species of xanthomonas, e.g. xcc, xac, and xcv. the xps system secretes xylanases and proteases and is under control of hrpg and hrpx  <cit> , indicating differential regulation. both xps and xcs systems are present in all three draft genomes.

xanthomonads possess diverse repertoires of cell-wall degrading enzymes, which are present in diverse genomic arrangement patterns
each species of xanthomonas has its own collection of genes encoding endoxylanases, endoglucanases, and pectate lyases which contribute to cell wall deconstruction during pathogenesis. we have compared these repertoires from the three draft genomes and other xanthomonads as detailed in table  <dig>  the genes are designated for different families of glycosyl hydrolases  and polysaccharide lyases  that include the enzymes that cleave glycosidic bonds in the structural polysaccharides of plant cell walls.

different cell wall degrading enzymes, such as xylanase, pectate lyase, glucanases, were compared for their repertoires among already sequenced xanthomonads including our draft genomes. genes identified by their locus tags in the respective genomes.

genes encoding secreted endoxylanases regulated by the xps genes have been described for their contributions to virulence, including xcv <dig>  <cit>  encoding gh <dig> endoxyalanase. the gh <dig> family catalyses the cleavage of methylglucuronoxylans in the cell walls of monocots and dicots at a β- <dig> -xylosidic bond penultimate to one linking the xylose residue that is substituted by an α- <dig> -linked 4-o-methylglucuronate residue  <cit> . such an enzyme secreted by erwinia chrysanthemi generates oligosaccharides that are not assimilated for growth, suggesting a function in which it contributes to cell wall deconstruction for access to pectates for growth substrate  <cit> . it is interesting to note the orthologous genes encoding gh <dig> enzymes are absent in xg and xv, with a truncated xyn <dig> gene in xac. on the basis of sequence homology, xyn <dig> genes may also contribute to virulence in xoo, xcc and xp.

the more common gh <dig> endoxylanases, which occur in several bacterial and fungal phyla, have been implicated in the virulence of plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi  <cit> . in xoo, deletion of the gene encoding a gh <dig> xyn10b resulted in diminished virulence  <cit> . all sequenced xanthomonas genomes contain either two or three copies of xyn <dig> genes, all of which are within a gene cluster that may comprise a single operon . the gh <dig> endoxylanases are the best studied of all of the xylanases, and structure/function relationships may be inferred on the basis of gene sequence. the action of these enzymes on glucuronoxylans generates xylotriose, xylobiose, and small amounts of xylose that generally serve as substrates for growth. also generated is methylglucuronoxylotriose, that is formed to the extent that xylose residues in the β- <dig>  xylan backbone are substituted with α- <dig> -linked 4-o-methylglucuronate residues  <cit> .

an adjacent gene cluster in an opposite orientation contains agu <dig> gene encoding a gh <dig> α-glucuronidase that serves to catayze the removal of 4-o-methylglucuronate from the reducing terminus of methylglucuronoxylotriose. this activity provides a synergistic function to the overall xylanolytic process to generate xylotriose, which is converted to xylose by xylanases and xylosidases for complete metabolism  <cit> . the coregulation of operons encoding xynb and agu <dig> enzymes occurs as a logical condition to coordinate expression of genes that encode these and additional enzymes that collectively process glucuronxylans and glucuronoarabinoxylans for complete metabolism. the accessory enzymes and transporters necessary for the function of these enzymes are embedded within these operons in gram positive bacteria  <cit>  and share similarities noted here with xanthomonas spp.. these include the genes encoding two glycohydrolases, a β-xylosidase and an α-l-arabinofuranosidase. also included in this cluster are genes encoding enzymes for intracellular metabolism of glucuronate and xylose, including glucuronate isomerase; xylulose isomerase; d-mannonate dehydratase; and d-mannonate oxidoreductase. genes encoding mannitol dehydrogenase and the hexuronate transporter, as well as the tonb-dependent receptor and laci transcriptional regulator, flank these two operons.

the arrangement and content of xylanolytic enzymes differentiate xanthomonas species into three groups . here, we propose a common nomenclature for xylanases, the genes for which have been annotated in the sequenced genomes. members of the first group are xac, xcv and xp in which all three genes encoding gh <dig> endoxylanases  are present, and with additional genes further downstream in this cluster. members of the second group are xcc, xv and xg in which genes encoding two of the three endoxylanases are present  and where one or more of the the downstream genes are absent. xoo strains represent a third group in which a different set of two endoxylanase encoding genes are present  and where the β-galactosidase and gluconolactonase genes flanking xyn10c are absent. it is noteworthy that the organization of genes in the cluster encoding the α-glucuronidase is conserved across xanthomonas species.

genes involved in several type iv secretion systems are present in genomes and plasmids
like xcv, the tomato pathogens, xg, xv and xp, also appear to contain more than one copy of a type iv secretion system  cluster . two t4ss clusters  are present in xcv, and genes belonging to both of these systems are found on plasmids  <cit> . the dot/icm type system is absent from xv, xp and xg.

in xv and xp, genes for one t4ss are on a plasmid and the second one on the chromosome while in xg, two t4ss gene clusters are on a plasmid and one is on the chromosome. the two t4ss clusters on plasmids of xg do not show any similarity to the genes for t4ss in xac, xcv, xcc and xoo. of the two t4ss clusters in xg, one is also found in xv and xp. this cluster appears to be exclusive to these three tomato pathogens . the genes belonging to this cluster show low  identity to the t4ss clusters from ralstonia, burkholderia, bradyrhizobium, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the other cluster from xg, which is absent from xv and xp, shows very high identity  and synteny to the t4ss cluster of burkholderia multivorans and around 89% identity to a t4ss cluster of acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli .

apart from the plasmid borne t4ss genes, xcv also contains a portion of a type iv system cluster on the chromosome and consists of virb <dig>  virb <dig>  virb <dig>  vird <dig> genes. this chromosomal cluster is flanked by a transposon element  that might indicate its horizontal gene transfer. xp, xg and xv genomes contain a complete chromosomal t4ss cluster showing high identity to the t4ss chromosomal clusters from xcc .

type v secreted adhesins function in synergism during pathogenesis
different adhesins have been shown to function at different stages of the infection process starting with attachment, entry, later survival inside host tissue and colonization by promoting virulence  <cit> . fhab hemagglutinin, important for leaf attachment, survival inside plant tissue and biofilm formation, is present in all four tomato pathogens. in xcv, fhab is divided into two separate open reading frames, xcv <dig> and xcv <dig>  with the two-partner secretion domains being present in xcv <dig>  sequence alignment indicates that fhab is possibly inactivated in xcv by the internal stop codon that separates xcv <dig> from xcv <dig>  in the case of xoo pxo99a, the xanthomonas adhesin-like proteins xada and xadb promote virulence by enhancing colonization of the leaf surface and leaf entry through hydathode  <cit> . as in xcv and xac, xp encodes two copies of xada, while xv and xg possess a single ortholog of xada as does xcc. yaph and the type iv pilus protein pilq were shown to be involved in virulence in xoo during later stages of growth and migration in xylem vessels. in xcv, xc, and xookacc, two copies of yaph are present. there are two pilq orthologs in xcv and only one in other sequenced xanthomonads. next to the fhab and fhac adhesin genes, hms operon is present in the genomes of xanthomonads, the homologs of which are pga operon genes in e. coli involved in biofilm formation  <cit> .

type vi secretion system is present in xcv, xv and xp
type vi secretion system  has been shown recently to contribute to host pathogen interactions during pathogenesis in vibrio cholerae, burkholderia pseudomallei and pseudomonas aeruginosa. hcp  and vgr  proteins are exported by the t6ss  <cit> . t6ss clusters can be assigned to three different types in xanthomonads . xcv and xp possess two types of t6sss ; whereas xv contains only a single type of t6ss, type  <dig>  as in xcc, there is no t6ss cluster in xg .

lps locus displays remarkable variation in sequence and number of coding genes and shows host specific variation
the lipopolysaccharide  biosynthesis cluster has been studied in detail in xcc  <cit> , which comprises three regions; region  <dig> from wxca to wxce involved in biosynthesis of water soluble lps antigen; region  <dig>  coding for lps core genes; and region  <dig> from wxck to wxco coding for enzymes for modification of nucleotide sugars and sugar translocation systems. this lps biosynthesis locus is positioned between highly conserved housekeeping genes, namely cystathionine gamma lyase  and electron transport flavoprotein , as reported in other xanthomonads  <cit> . comparison of this cluster from draft genomes to the already sequenced xanthomonads revealed high variability in the number of genes and their sequences. xv and xg have an identical type of lps gene cluster of  <dig>  kb encoding  <dig> open reading frames  which is similar in organization and sequence identity to the lps locus from xcc strains. interestingly, xg and xv also contain two glycosyl transferases involved in synthesis of xylosylated polyrhamnan as seen in xcc  <cit> , in contrast to glycosyl transferases  involved in synthesis of polymannan in xcv  <cit> . this suggests that basic structure of o-antigen in xg and xv is similar to xcc. the three tomato/pepper pathogens xcv, xv and xg have retained an ancestral type of lps gene cluster . on the other hand, xp has acquired a novel lps gene cluster during the course of evolution and is completely different in sequence and number of genes that are encoded. in xp, this lps locus is  <dig>  kb long and encodes  <dig> orfs, all of which are absent in the corresponding genomic region of xcv, xv or xg. also the first five orfs flanking the metb side of the lps locus in xp  showed very low or no identity to region  <dig> of the lps locus in the other xanthomonads. however, these orfs still belong to the same pfam families  <cit>  that are usually present in this region, for example, abc transporters and glycosyl transferases. the second half of the lps cluster flanking etfa side encodes six orfs, which are homologs of the lps cluster genes from xac, xcm and xoo. phylogenetic insight based on conserved metb and etfa genes that flank the lps locus suggest that the ancestor of all the xanthomonas pathogens of pepper and tomato studied in this paper had the same lps gene cluster, however putative horizontal gene transfer events at this locus have led to the acquisition of a novel lps gene cluster in xp . alien_hunter analysis also supports this acquisition with a high score showing this region to belong to an anomalous region . this event might have played a major role in changing the specificity of xp towards tomato and its dominance over its relative as reported previously  <cit> , similar to variant epidemic strain of vibrio cholerae, reported to be a major reason for its emergence and cholera outbreak during the 1990's in the indian subcontinent  <cit> . identity in terms of sequences and gene organization among pepper pathogens and absence of those genes from x. perforans and a novel lps cluster in the tomato pathogen x. perforans suggest a role of this cluster in host specific variation.

analysis of dsf cell-cell signaling system
rpfc/rpfg are two-component signaling factors and are involved in dsf  cell-cell signaling  <cit> , known to co-ordinate virulence and biofilm gene expression. the genomes of xv, xp, and xg carry an rpf  gene cluster  that is found in all xanthomonads and which encodes components governing the synthesis and perception of the signal molecule dsf  <cit> . the rpf of the dsf system regulates the synthesis of virulence factors and biofilm formation and is required for the full virulence of xcc, xac, xoc, and xoo  <cit> . rpff is responsible for the synthesis of dsf, whereas, rpfc and rpfg are implicated in dsf perception and signal transduction  <cit> . rpfc is a complex sensor kinase, whereas rpfg is a response regulator with a chey-like receiver domain that is attached to an hd-gyp domain. hd-gyp domains act in degradation of the second messenger cyclic di-gmp  <cit> . in addition to genes encoding these products, xg and xp have rpfh, which encodes a membrane protein related to the sensory input domain rpfc but whose function is unknown. xv contains rpfh but with an internal stop codon, whereas functional rpfh is present in xcv and xcc, and totally absent in xac and xoo.

cyclic di-gmp signaling
cyclic di-gmp is a second messenger known to regulate a range of functions in diverse bacteria, including the virulence of animal and plant pathogens  <cit> . the cellular level of cyclic di-gmp is controlled by a balance between synthesis by ggdef domain diguanylate cyclases and degradation by hd-gyp or eal domain phosphodiesterases. ggdef, eal and hd-gyp domains are largely found in combination with other signaling domains, suggesting that their activities in cyclic di-gmp turnover can be modulated by environmental cues. a number of proteins involved in cyclic di-gmp signaling have been implicated in virulence of xcc  <cit> . the genome of xcv encodes  <dig> proteins with an hd-gyp domain and  <dig> proteins with ggdef and/or eal domains. as in other xanthomonas spp., the hd-gyp domain proteins are completely conserved in xcv, xv, xg and xp. there is also almost complete conservation of ggdef/eal domain proteins between xcv and three draft genomes, although xv has no ortholog of xcv <dig> . in addition, the eal domain protein  encoded on a plasmid in xcv is absent in the other strains.

copper resistance  genes are present in xv and copper homeostasis  genes are present in all strains
among the xcv, xv, xp and xg strains sequenced, xv is the only one resistant to copper and the only strain harboring a set of plasmid borne genes, namely copl, copa, copb, copm, copg, copc, copd, and copf that are also present in copper resistant strains of xac  and s. maltophilia  <cit> . genes copa and copb have been previously annotated as copper resistance related genes for many different xanthomonad genomes including xoo, xoc, xcv, xac and xcc. homologs of these genes are also present in xv, xg and xp and are located on the chromosome. additionally, upstream of copa on the chromosome of all strains, there is an orf that shares homology with plasmid copl. in contrast to what has been published, chromosomal copa and copb are not responsible for copper resistance but likely for copper homeostasis and/or tolerance. while strains harboring the plasmid-borne cop genes, like in xv, are resistant to copper and can grow on mgy agar  amended with up to  <dig> mg l- <dig> of copper sulfate pentahydrate, strains that have only the chromosomal cop genes as for xcv, xp and xg, are sensitive to copper and can only grow on media amended up to  <dig> mg l- <dig> of copper. nucleotide sequence of plasmid cop genes in xv are 98% similar to the ones found in xac and stenotrophomonas, whereas chromosomal coplab from xv is 83% identical to homolog orfs in xcv, xg and xp. when copl, copa and copb genes from xv located on the plasmid are compared to the homologs on the chromosome of the same strain, the identity of nucleotide sequences is  <dig>   <dig>  and 65%, respectively. to avoid further confusion or misinterpretation, we suggest that the nomenclature of the chromosomal copl, copa and copb genes in xanthomonads should be changed to cohl, coha and cohb, respectively, referring to copper homeostasis genes. new nomenclature has been adopted in the annotation of the draft genomes.

genes unique to x. perforans as compared to pepper pathogens give clues to its predominance over xcv in the field and host specificity
thirteen gene clusters were found to be specific to the tomato pathogen xp when compared to the other three strains . a part of the clusters are syntenic to the genomic regions specific to the three pepper pathogens, suggesting the replacement of these genomic regions from pepper pathogens in correspond to these region in xp. these replaced regions in xp might provide potential candidates for host range determinants. most notable among these regions was the lps cluster genes . other such regions include the avirulence genes avrxv <dig> and avrxv <dig>  a tir-like domain containing protein, oxidoreductases, and bacteriocin-like proteins that were not found in any other sequenced xanthomonads. importance of bacteriocin-like genes in xp has already been studied for its predominance in the field over t <dig> strains  <cit> . alien_hunter analysis showed that the bacteriocin bcn-a region belongs to an anomalous region indicating possible horizontal gene transfer of this region .

pepper pathogenicity/aggressiveness factors increased in planta growth of xp
comparison of proteomes of xv, xg, xcv against xp showed  <dig> genes exclusive to pepper pathogens which might be candidate virulence factors on pepper . these include  <dig> genes with known function,  <dig> coding for mobile genetic elements, and  <dig> genes with unknown function/hypothetical proteins. out of the  <dig> genes with known function, xopg was confirmed to be a type iii effector using the avrbs <dig> reporter gene assay and  <dig> genes belong to the lps biosynthesis gene cluster. these  <dig> genes were searched against already sequenced genomes of xac, xcc and xoo. the wxco gene, which codes for o-antigen, has been identified to be a virulence factor in the x. fuscans - bean pathosystem by subtractive hybridization  <cit> . three genes, xcv <dig>  xcv <dig> and wxco, were initially selected for the verification of their contribution to virulence in pepper. individual genes along with their promoter regions were cloned into plafr <dig> and conjugated individually and in combination into x. perforans me <dig> , which no longer elicits an hr in pepper. however, in planta growth of me <dig> is more similar to that of an avirulent strain than the virulent pepper strain ted <dig> race  <dig>  me <dig> transconjugants carrying wxco and xcv <dig> in combination showed increased in planta growth and also comparatively increased number of lesions on pepper cv. ecw when compared to me <dig> revealing that these two genes play in fact a role in pepper pathogenicity .

genes specific to xg as compared to other tomato/pepper pathogens may explain its aggressive nature on tomato and pepper
comparison of genes from xg against xcv, xp and xv genes showed the presence of  <dig> genes specific to xg . these include four type iii effectors , twenty-one genes belonging to the unique type iv secretion system cluster and associated genes. these genes can be speculated to contribute to the aggressive nature of xg strains on tomato and pepper. xg also contains a unique beta xylosidase not present in any other xanthomonads. type ii secreted beta xylosidase has been studied for its role in plant cell wall digestion. moreover, xg contains xga_ <dig> coding for a hemolysin-type calcium-binding repeat containing protein, a homolog of which is found in xylella strains with 55% sequence identity. in xylella, this gene is annotated as a member of a family of pore forming toxins/rtx toxins. its homolog is also found in other plant pathogens . this protein has been described as a type i effector in x. fastidiosa strain temecula   <cit> . rtx toxin family members, especially of the hemolysin type, have been shown to be virulence factors in a variety of cell types in eukaryotes  <cit> . finally, a gene xga_ <dig> coding for lanthionine synthetase  is found among these xg specific genes, a homolog of which is found in xvm ncppb <dig>  lanl enzymes in pathogenic bacteria contribute to virulence by modifying the host signaling pathways, in most cases by inactivating mapks  <cit> .

genes common to all tomato pathogens but absent from other sequenced xanthomonads
in order to see what defines the tomato pathogens, we compared the four sequenced genomes  to other sequenced xanthomonads. we found seven genes that were conserved in all four tomato pathogens and absent from most of other sequenced xanthomonads with the exception of xcm, xvv, xaub and xauc, which possess homologs for six out of these seven genes . only the hypothetical protein xcv <dig> seems to be specific to the four tomato pathogens. this gene shows only 35% sequence identity to a gene from xvv and xcm. a homolog of the hypothetical protein, xcv <dig> was found in xau, but is absent from all other sequenced xanthomonads. genes homologous in xcm and xvv include two transposase genes both belonging to the transposase  <dig> superfamily , xcv <dig> , xcv <dig> , xcv <dig>  . interestingly, xcv <dig> encodes a protein known to be involved in phenylpropanoid degradation. phenylpropanoids are well known plant secondary metabolites induced during defense response upon pathogen attack  <cit> . it appears that the four tomato pathogens along with xvv and xcm have acquired this function to disarm the basal plant defense.

xanthomonas campestris pv.
the evolution of pathogenicity clusters corresponds to the mlst-based phylogeny
the correlation between tree topology using mlst and phylogeny based on the sequences of pathogenicity clusters and the avrbs <dig> effector gene, which is found in all xanthomonads, was tested. based on mlst, xp and xcv group together along with xac while xg is more closely related to xcc. xv forms a different clade and is more closely related to the xcc group. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  phylogeny based on mlst is congruent with phylogeny based on the pathogenicity clusters  and based on the avrbs <dig> effector, suggesting that overall these clusters were vertically inherited from the most recent common ancestor of these strains.

CONCLUSIONS
the interaction of xanthomonas strains with tomato and pepper represents a model system for studying plant-pathogen co-evolution because of the diversity present among the strains causing bacterial spot. although the four xanthomonas species infect the same host, tomato, and cause very similar disease, they are genetically diverse pathogens. the comparative genomic analysis has provided insights into the evolution of these strains. whole genome comparisons revealed that xg and xv are more closely related to xcc than xcv and xp. a few pathogenicity clusters, such as hrp, xcs and xps of xg and xv, were similar in terms of genetic organization and sequence identity to xcc . however, a few pathogenicity clusters of the four strains belonging to four phylogenetic groups showed different evolutionary origins. while the pepper pathogens xcv, xv and xg possess similar lps biosynthesis cluster, part of the lps cluster from xp is similar to the one from xac . xv contains few effectors, including xopag  and xopai the latter of which was previously found to be unique to citrus pathogens xac, xaub and xauc  <cit> . xg has a number of effectors homologous to p. syringae type iii effectors suggesting probable horizontal transfer of these effectors. xg contains a unique t4ss along with the one that is exclusive to xp, xv and xg. xp has two t6sss, as found in xcv. xv has only one t6ss which is similar to that of xac. xg has no t6ss as seen for xcc . while xg and xv show close relationship to xcc based on whole genome comparisons, few pathogenicity clusters mentioned above seem to be conserved among tomato/pepper xanthomonads.

type iii effectors have been investigated for their contribution to pathogenicity and host-range specificity. in addition to homologs of the known effectors, we identified novel effectors in the draft genomes. by comparing effector repertoires of tomato pathogens, two possible candidate pathogenicity determinants, xopf <dig> and xopd, were identified, of which xopd is responsible for delaying symptom development, and in turn, is important for pathogen survival. unique genes present in xg include the novel effectors xopao, xopaq, xopas and an avrbs <dig> member as well as a few other virulence factors, which have been characterized in other plant pathogens and which could explain the aggressive nature of xg on pepper. each species contains at least three unique type iii effectors, which could explain host preferences among the strains and their aggressiveness on tomato/pepper. comparison of the lps clusters between the four species revealed significant variation. xp has acquired a novel lps cluster during evolution, which might be responsible for its predominance and its limited host range. as seen from the in planta growth assay of xp Δavrxv <dig> mutant carrying the lps o-antigen from xcv, the lps cluster from pepper pathogens can be a contributor to the increased in planta growth of xp Δavrxv <dig> mutant on pepper, but is not the absolute virulence determinant. use of the xa <dig> receptor similar to the xoo-rice system in xcv - tomato/pepper could be one of the ways to confer resistance to xanthomonads due to presence of a similar ax <dig> peptide and a functional rax system in xcv. common and unique genes encoding enzymes involved in cell wall deconstruction are candidates for further study to define host preference and virulence.

in conclusion, comparison of draft genomes obtained by next generation sequencing has allowed an in-depth study of diverse groups of bacterial spot pathogens at the genomic level. this analysis will serve as a basis to infer evolution of new virulent strains and overcoming existing host resistance. the knowledge of potential virulence or pathogenicity factors is expected to aid in devising effective control strategies and breeding for durable resistance in tomato and pepper cultivars.
