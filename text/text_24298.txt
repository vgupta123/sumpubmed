BACKGROUND
the human leukocyte antigen  or the major histocompatibility complex  is a highly polymorphic region of the human genome  that is critically involved in the rejection and graft-versus-host disease  of hematopoietic stem cell transplants  <cit> , the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune diseases  <cit> , infectious diseases  <cit>  and drug adverse reactions  <cit> . many variations of the conventional hla genotyping methods such as incorporating restriction fragment polymorphisms   <cit> , single strand conformation polymorphism   <cit> , sequence specific oligonucleotides   <cit> , sequence specific primers   <cit>  and sequence based typing , like the sanger method  <cit> , have been used for the efficient and rapid hla matching in transplantation therapy  <cit> , research into autoimmunity and hla related diseases  <cit> , population diversity studies  <cit>  and in forensic and paternity testing  <cit> . the hla genotyping methods mainly applied today are pcr-ssop, such as the luminex commercial methodology  <cit> , and sbt by the sanger method employing capillary sequencing based on chain-termination reactions  <cit> . however, both methods often detect more than one pair of unresolved hla alleles because of chromosomal phase  ambiguity  <cit> . to solve the phase ambiguity problem, we previously reported the development and application of the super high resolution-single molecule-sequence-based typing  method using long-range pcr of the sample dna from the promoter-enhancer region to the 3′ untranslated region  for  <dig> classical hla loci, hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, hla-drb <dig>  hla-drb3/4/ <dig>  hla-dqa <dig>  hla-dqb <dig>  hla-dpa <dig>  and hla-dpb <dig> in combination with next generation sequencing  platforms such as ion pgm  and gs junior   <cit> . other long-range pcr and ngs-based hla genotyping methods using  <dig> gs-flx  and miseq  platforms  <cit>  also resolved the phase ambiguities. thus, the ngs methods combined with the long-range pcr technology are expected to produce genotyping results to the field  <dig> level  allelic resolution to efficiently detect new and null alleles without phase ambiguity.

the ngs methods are usually divided into three basic steps, long-range pcr of the dna samples, ngs, and allele assignment step   <cit> . before performing the ngs step there are at least five sub-steps for pcr, such as preparation of dna template and pcr mixes, the pcr runs, electrophoresis, purification, and quantitative determination of the pcr products . multiple micro-tubes are required for the singleplex pcr. for example, at least six micro-tubes are required to amplify nine loci per dna sample . at least two kinds of ngs library preparation processes can be used after performing the long-range singleplex pcr procedure. one process is to prepare a number of single locus tagging ngs libraries and then pool all of them into a single ngs library ). the other process is to pool all of the pcr products and prepare a single ngs library for each of the tagged multiple loci as a multiplex ngs library ). however, the long-range singleplex pcr amplification and ngs library preparation as outlined in figures 1b  and b  are extremely labor intensive and time consuming. furthermore, it is easy to make human errors at the pooling stage that negatively influence the sequence read numbers. therefore, simplification, acceleration and cost-saving in the ngs protocols are required if they are to become routine dna typing methods and replace the conventional hla genotyping methods such as sbt and pcr-ssop .figure  <dig> workflow by the ion pgm sequencer  and three different nine loci hla genotyping procedures by pcr and ngs . white and gray boxes indicate experimental steps using either several micro-tubes or a single micro-tube, respectively. numbers in micro-tubes indicate template dna amounts .



in this paper, we describe the development and evaluation of four types of multiplex pcr methods that genotype multiple hla loci to the field  <dig> level  using combinations of locus specific pcr primers for up to nine classical hla loci . we evaluated the uniformity and accuracy of ngs-based hla genotyping among the nine hla loci and between hla alleles obtained by one of the multiplex pcr methods  in a single ngs run with the ion pgm sequencer using  <dig> genomic dna reference samples from japanese subjects who represented a distribution of more than  <dig> % hla alleles in each of the hla locus in the japanese population. in addition, we investigated template dna amounts as low as 1 ng to evaluate the smallest amounts of genomic dna samples that we could use successfully in our multiplex pcr methods for ngs-based hla genotyping.

RESULTS
characteristics of four types of multiplex pcr methods
four types of multiplex pcr methods were developed after optimization of primer composition and pcr conditions such as annealing and extension temperatures using the hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, hla-drb1/3/4/ <dig>  hla-dqb <dig>  and hla-dpb <dig> specific primer pair sets . these four types were ci: a/b/c, cii: drb1/3/4/5/dqb1/dpb <dig>  7loci: a/b/c/drb1/3/4/ <dig>  and 9loci: a/b/c/drb1/3/4/5/dqb1/dpb <dig>  two, three, three, and four bands that reflect the targeted pcr products were observed in ci, cii, 7loci, and 9loci multiplex pcr methods, respectively. although most of the bands overlapped because of their similar pcr lengths as for hla-b and hla-c in ci , it is noteworthy that hla-a in ci , and hla-dpb <dig> in cii and 9loci  were clearly observed as unique bands. in addition, the pcr product from the hla-drb <dig> gene varies in size depending on the dr sub-type such as  <dig>  kb in the dr <dig> sub-type and  <dig> - <dig>  kb in the other dr sub-types.figure  <dig> band patterns of the multiplex pcr products. electrophoresis images of pcr products from four unrelated genomic dna samples  using four types of multiplex pcr methods, ci , cii , 7loci  and  <dig> loci , respectively. numbers  <dig> to  <dig> above the lanes indicate genomic dna samples ww <dig>  ww <dig>  ww <dig>  and ww <dig>  respectively. the lanes labeled m are bands of the  <dig> kb dna size marker ladder. the size of the bands and the hla loci amplified by pcr are indicated on the right side of the figure.



when we applied the nine loci multiplex pcr  method using  <dig> genomic dna samples , the pcr products with similar band patterns were observed in all samples, although weak bands were also observed in some samples such as jpn <dig>  jpn <dig>  jpn <dig>  and jpn <dig> .

sequence read information obtained from  <dig> genomic dna samples
sequence read information was obtained for all the  <dig> genomic dna samples after sequencing of the 9loci products using the ion pgm system in a single sequencing run after gathering the  <dig> barcode-labeled dna libraries into one tube. draft read numbers in total were  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads with a range of reads from  <dig>  in jpn <dig> to  <dig>  sequence reads in jpn <dig>  on average) that were high quality sequence reads with more than  <dig> quality values  and an average qv of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the high quality sequence reads. the draft read bases in total were  <dig>  mb with a range between  <dig>  mb in jpn <dig> and  <dig>  mb in jpn <dig> , with an overall average read length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bases and an overall mode read length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bases . therefore, the sequence reads had high quality and sufficient sequence volume for further hla genotyping analysis.

genotyping to the field  <dig> level on the nine hla loci
nucleotide similarity searches of the sequenced hla alleles to the field  <dig> level using the blat program identified  <dig> alleles at the six hla loci , except for drb3/4/ <dig>  that were consistent with known hla alleles assigned by the conventional luminex method . of the heterozygous  <dig> alleles,  <dig> were defined as two separate hla alleles without any ambiguities. however, one locus observed in jpn <dig>  was not defined fully due to the absence of an informative snp in exon  <dig> for dpb1*25: <dig> that was needed to assign the correct allele at the locus. also, five types of ambiguous hla alleles, such as drb1*04:07:01/*04: <dig>  drb1*04:10:01/*04:10: <dig>  drb1*09:01:02/*09: <dig>  drb1*12:01:01/*12: <dig>  and dpb1*13:01/*107: <dig> at a total of  <dig> loci, were observed because the informative snps that differentiate between ambiguous alleles were located outside of the pcr regions such as within exon  <dig> or exon  <dig> of hla-drb <dig> or hla-dpb <dig> .

from the results of genotyping to the field  <dig> level, five hla-drb <dig>  three hla-drb <dig>  and three hla-drb <dig> alleles were assigned in the  <dig> dna samples . there were thirty drb1-drb3/4/ <dig> haplotypes in total with  <dig> assigned as the drb1-drb <dig> haplotype,  <dig> as drb1-drb <dig>  and three as drb1-drb <dig>  these haplotypes were identified by estimating hla-drb <dig> and hla-drb3/4/ <dig> alleles without any descrepancy to previously reported drb structures  <cit> .table  <dig>

moreover, mapping analysis including other exons and introns using the seabass program suggested that no recombinations were evident within the gene loci examined for the  <dig> genomic samples . through this process one synonymous substitution was newly detected in exon  <dig> of hla-c*07: <dig> of jpn <dig> 

evaluation of the 9loci multiplex pcr method
to evaluate the 9loci method, we compared the depth of redundancy derived from the sequence read numbers between hla alleles and among hla loci. an observed average depth and range for six hla loci was as follows:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for hla-a,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for hla-b, <dig>  ±  <dig>  from  <dig> to  <dig>  for hla-c,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for hla-drb <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for hla-dqb <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for hla-dpb <dig> . the average depth ratio was mostly even for both alleles, ranging from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in hla-drb <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in hla-a, but allelic imbalances of  <dig> - <dig>  were observed in eight dna samples of hla-b and  <dig> dna samples of hla-drb <dig> . most of the loci contained specific hla allele groups such as b* <dig> and drb1* <dig>  on the other hand, an observed average depth among the hla locus was from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in hla-dpb <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in hla-drb <dig>  when we normalized the values using the average sequence read numbers , the depth was from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in hla-dpb <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in hla-drb <dig> . a locus balance plot showed locus imbalance among the loci ranging from high at hla-drb <dig> and hla-dqb <dig> to low at hla-a and hla-dpb <dig> . however, the genotypes obtained at all the loci  in this study, were consistent with known hla alleles to the field  <dig> level with more than  <dig> depth units per allele in dpb1*05:01: <dig> of jpn <dig>  suggesting that the locus balance completely made up for the allelic imbalances observed for some specific alleles. taken together, the 9loci pcr and ngs is a precise hla genotyping method with relevant locus balance and without excessive allelic imbalance  affecting the results deleteriously.table  <dig>

investigation of template dna amounts for the 9loci method
in order to achieve precise hla genotyping for the 9loci method even with using extremely small amounts of genomic dna samples, we tried the 9loci multiplex pcr using four different amounts of template dna, 1 ng, 5 ng, and 10 ng, along with standard amount of 25 ng. amplified pcr products were observed for all of the template dna amounts ranging from  <dig> to 25 ng . the dna amounts after purification of the pcr products ranged from  <dig>  ng  to  <dig>  ng  in tu <dig>  and from  <dig>  ng  to  <dig>  ng  in tu <dig>  the purified pcr products of 100 ng were used for construction of ion pgm libraries. the molarities after construction of ion pgm libraries ranged from  <dig>  pm  to  <dig>  pm , and the sequence read numbers ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the genotype results obtained for the eight samples used in this test of template dna amounts were consistent to the previously assigned hla alleles  <cit> .figure  <dig> electrophoresis images of pcr products from two unrelated genomic dna samples tu <dig> and tu <dig> using the 9loci method. numbers  <dig> to  <dig> above the lanes indicate the template dna amounts 25 ng, 10 ng, 5 ng, and 1 ng, respectively. the lanes labeled m are bands of the 1 kb dna size marker ladder.



discussion
in this study, we used a reference set of  <dig> japanese subjects that represented a distribution of more than  <dig> % of the japanese hla alleles at the nine hla loci genotyped by the multiplex pcr-ngs method using the ion pgm system. all of the genotypes and linkages of drb <dig> and drb3/4/ <dig> alleles were consistent with known alleles  and previous publications  <cit> , suggesting that a combination of our multiplex pcr methods and the ion pgm system is an efficient and accurate hla genotyping method for the detection of hla alleles to the field  <dig> level of genotyping without phase ambiguity. in addition, pcr products were obtained from all of the hla loci by the multiplex pcr-ngs methods in tests using  <dig> non-japanese , subjects, confirming that the methods will be useful for the japanese as well as for other world-wide populations .

the high density in the average depth of sequences by ngs suggests that an increase in the dna sample numbers for sequencing beyond  <dig> per run as described here is likely to contribute to even lower costs. for example,  <dig>  sequence reads for sample jpn <dig> that was imbalanced at drb1*04:06: <dig> was assigned with a sequence depth of  <dig> . when we assume that an average of  <dig>  sequence reads was obtained from a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads that have a similar quality to those described in additional file 2: table s <dig>  then at least  <dig> dna samples could have been genotyped in a single run using ion pgm. the multiplex pcr methods for hla genotyping could also be used on other ngs platforms such as miseq , gs junior and  <dig> gs-flx , as well as on the 3rd generation sequencing platform pacbio rs  that is based on single molecule real-time  technology .

although, a few samples like jpn <dig>  were not fully resolved by the multiplex pcr-ngs method, this problem could be solved in future by determining the full gene nucleotide sequence for the dpb <dig> gene with the *25: <dig> allele. hence, it is necessary to comprehensively collect the hla allele sequences for all of the pcr regions of all the hla genes to avoid misidentifying the true locus because of potential problems of allele sharing between different loci or pcr amplification of sequences in the wrong gene regions. in this study, only five ambiguous hla alleles, drb1*04:07:01/*04: <dig>  drb1*04:10:01/*04:10: <dig>  drb1*09:01:02/*09: <dig>  drb1*12:01:01/*12: <dig>  and dpb1*13:01/*107: <dig>  were observed at  <dig> loci. in these cases, the ambiguities were not solved because the informative snps for these genes are outside of the pcr regions such as in some of the introns or the 5′ and 3′ non-coding regions or because the informative snps that differentiate between ambiguous alleles are located outside of the pcr regions such as within exon  <dig> or exon  <dig> of hla-drb <dig> or hla-dpb <dig> . it is noteworthy, however, that there was no problem with phase ambiguity for more than 99% of the hla alleles detected by the 9loci method that included the signature sequences of the highly polymorphic exon  <dig> that play an important role for antigen presentation. therefore, the multiplex pcr-ngs hla genotyping method that we have described here is highly effective, accurate and informative and provides an important alternative to the conventional hla genotyping methods such as sbt and pcr-ssop that are currently in use in the clinical laboratory. when we applied our previously published long-range pcr primer sets for the ambiguous loci  <cit> , dpb1*05:01: <dig> and dpb1*25: <dig>  drb1*04:07: <dig>  drb1*04:10: <dig>  drb1*09:01: <dig>  drb1*12:01: <dig>  and dpb1*13: <dig> were assigned without ambiguity. these alleles were consistent with known hla alleles previously assigned by the conventional methods .figure  <dig> outline of the targeted pcr regions in nine hla loci. black, gray and white boxes indicate promoter regions, highly polymorphic exons and the other exons, respectively.



to evaluate the sequencing parameters for the 9loci pcr-ngs method, we compared the sequencing depth derived from the sequence read numbers between hla alleles and among hla loci. the lowest observed average depth  was for hla-dpb <dig> among the six loci with more than a read depth of  <dig> , where a depth of at least  <dig> is necessary to identify genetic variants with the highest sensitivity and resolution  <cit> . in this respect, it will be necessary to improve the sequence reads of hla-dpb <dig> by further optimization of primer composition.

in contrast to the one simple multiplex pcr step that is required for the  <dig> hla loci, the singleplex pcr models described in figure 1b  and b  require many more repetitive steps to amplify the  <dig> hla loci and at least five complicated pcr steps for each locus such as preparation of pcr reagents and dna templates, long range singleplex pcr, electrophoresis, purification, and quantitative determination of the pcr products before preparing the single locus tagging ngs libraries and pooling of all libraries ), and/or before pooling of all pcr products and preparing the multiple locus tagging ngs libraries ). as a more efficient, economical and rapid alternative to the time-consuming singleplex pcr of hla loci, we developed four types of multiplex pcr methods  for ngs-based hla genotyping of polymorphic exons.

all of the four types of multiplex pcr methods are useful for the hla genotyping , but the 9loci method is likely to be the more valuable method for future routine genotyping for the following reasons and technical advantages.  the 9loci genotyping method is capable not only for typing the specific hla loci such as hla-a, hla-b, and hla-drb <dig>  but also other classical hla loci such as hla-c, hla-drb3/4/ <dig>  hla-dqb <dig>  and hla-dpb <dig> at the same time .  the running cost and operation time for the pcr step in the 9loci method were reduced to one sixth of the singleplex pcr models. the use of only one micro-tube per sample for the pcr and ngs steps is time-saving and economically helpful for cost-savings on micro-tubes, dna polymerase and other reagents, and it also eliminates the pooling operations ). if the quantity of all template dna samples is adjusted accurately among the samples, then electrophoresis of the samples also could be omitted because the pcr products are quantified by the picogreen assay after their purification. thus, omission of some processes such as the pooling step that can influence the sequence read numbers could help to a further reduce potential human experimental errors.  the pcr step of multiplex 9loci pcr-ngs method for  <dig> dna samples was performed in one day. in comparison, the singleplex methods using  <dig> dna samples for each of the nine hla loci would have taken at least three days.  investigation of the template dna amount suggested that 1 ng of template dna is sufficient for genotyping all nine hla loci by the 9loci method . the 1 ng amount for the multiplex method is much less than that required for the singleplex pcr methods  and b ), and therefore markedly reduced the progressive loss of valuable dna samples that are required for genotyping of nine hla loci. this small dna amount also could be helpful for dna typing from swab samples derived from oral mucosa cells, facs derived lymphoma cells and other valuable clinical samples.  therefore, the multiplex pcr method for the nine hla loci greatly simplifies the procedures required in preparing the dna samples for ngs by reducing the time of preparation and the amount and costs of reagents, including the use of much smaller amounts of template dna samples. in addition, the use of different ngs methods might further improve the simplicity and cost of the multiplex pcr-ngs method in the future. for example, a new protocol using ion isothermal amplification chemistry that enables sequence reads of up to and beyond 500 bp, and ion hi-q™ sequencing chemistry that reduces consensus insertion and deletion  errors including homopolymer errors will be available in the near future , and might lead to further simplification and cost reduction with higher data quality.

CONCLUSIONS
our aim was to simplify and streamline the ngs-based hla genotyping method as an alternative to the conventional hla genotyping methods. although  <dig> genomic dna samples were used in the present study as an example of using multiple samples in a single genotyping run, we have recently applied the same methods for genotyping more than  <dig> dna samples from japanese, indian and french populations in a number of different genotyping runs to unequivocally define the hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, hla-drb1/3/4/ <dig>  hla-dqb <dig>  and hla-dpb <dig> loci to single hla alleles to the field  <dig> level without ambiguity. therefore, the multiplex pcr methods have contributed greatly to simplify, accelerate and reduce costs and reagents at the pcr step in the ngs-based hla genotyping method. the methods also conserve on the amounts of dna samples needed to genotype a multiple number of hla loci. overall, the multiplex pcr methods are a powerful tool that provides precise genotyping data without phase ambiguity and with a potential to replace the current routine genotyping methods to find polymorphisms. these methods may help to further activate many fields of medical research involved in the studies of transplantation, disease association, drug adverse reaction, peptide vaccination treatment for cancer and provide us with a better understanding about the diversity and evolution of the human mhc.
