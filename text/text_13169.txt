BACKGROUND
approaches for precise, efficient gene targeting or genome editing are highly important for functional genomic analysis of plants and for the production of genetically engineering crops. for the majority of researchers, transfer dna  and transposon insertional mutagenesis remain the main sources of mutants of genes of interest in model plants such as the dicot arabidopsis thaliana and the monocot rice   <cit> . there is an increasing demand for plants bearing mutations in multiple genes in order to dissect the functions of gene family members with redundant functions and to analyze epistatic relationships in genetic pathways. however, the current method for generating plants carrying multiple mutated genes requires time-consuming and labor-intensive genetic crossing of single-mutant plants. moreover, t-dna insertional mutants cannot be obtained for every gene of interest. therefore, new technologies that are affordable, efficient, and user-friendly are needed for plant genome targeting.

double-strand breaks  at specific genomic sites can introduce a mutation at the dna break site via the error-prone non-homologous end-joining  pathway. dsbs can also result in homologous recombination  between chromosomal dna and foreign donor dna through the hr pathway  <cit> . based on dsbs at target loci, sequence-specific nucleases, including homing meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, and transcription activator-like effector  nucleases have emerged as powerful technologies for targeted genome editing in eukaryotic organisms  <cit> .

recently, another dsb-based breakthrough technology for genome editing, the crispr/cas system, was developed  <cit> . this system is based on the bacterial and archaeal clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  adaptive immune system for purging invading viral and plasmid dna, which relies on the endonuclease activity of crispr-associated  proteins, with sequence specificity directed by crispr rnas   <cit> . the crispr/cas system, which is employed in a variety of organisms, is derived from the streptococcus pyogenes type ii crispr system and consists of three genes, including one encoding cas <dig> nuclease and two noncoding rna genes: trans-activating crrna  and precursor crrna . the programmable pre-crrna, which contains nuclease guide sequences  interspaced by identical direct repeats, is processed to mature crrna in combination with tracrrna. the two rna genes can be replaced by one rna gene using an engineered single guide rna  containing a designed hairpin that mimics the crrna–tracrrna complex. the binding specificity of cas <dig> with the target dna is determined by both grna–dna base pairing and a protospacer-adjacent motif  immediately downstream of the target region. both nuclease domains of cas <dig>  cleave one strand of double-stranded dna at the same site , resulting in a dsb  <cit> . the crispr/cas system has been harnessed to achieve efficient genome editing in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals, as well as human cell lines  <cit> . more importantly, using this rna-guided endonuclease technology, multiple gene mutations and their germline transmission have been achieved  <cit> .

in vertebrates such as zebrafish, mice, rats, and monkeys, coinjection of grna and cas9-encoding mrna transcribed in vitro into single-cell-stage embryos can efficiently generate animals with multiple biallelic mutations that can be transmitted to the next generation with high efficiency  <cit> . however, this method is not feasible in plants, where transgenic lines stably expressing the crispr/cas <dig> system are required for the generation of plants with one or more gene mutations. agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a routine method used to generate transgenic plants, and a few binary vectors have been developed to deliver the crispr/cas <dig> system into plant genomes via this method  <cit> . nevertheless, to accelerate the application of this system to a variety of plant species under normal or complex conditions , a toolkit with additional plant selectable markers, more grna modules, and easier methods for assembling one or more grna expression cassettes is frequently required, especially for targeted mutation of multiple genes. we report the development of such a toolkit for multiplex genome editing in plants.

RESULTS
crispr/cas <dig> binary vector set and grna module vector set for multiplex genome editing in plants
binary vectors with two types of backbones were utilized; one type is based on pgreen, while the other is based on pcambia. the pgreen binary vectors were constructed based on a previously reported strategy  <cit> . the advantage of pgreen-like vectors is their relatively small size, allowing them to be used for transient cas <dig> and grna expression in protoplasts to test the effectiveness of target sites. as the vectors can be directly used to generate transgenic plants after validation in protoplasts, the use of this single vector-based strategy for both transient and stable expression of crispr/cas <dig> can save time, effort and money. in agrobacterium, the pgreen-like vectors depend on their psa origin for propagation, and they require a helper plasmid to provide replication protein . agrobacterium containing psoup helper plasmid can be used as hosts for pgreen-like vectors  <cit> . among the pcambia-derived binary vectors, those with a hygromycin-resistance gene as a selectable marker were derived from pcambia <dig>  while those with a kanamycin-resistance gene were derived from pcambia <dig>  and those with a basta-resistance gene were derived from pcambia <dig>  the vectors pcambia1300/2300/ <dig> and their derivatives  are some of the most widely used binary vectors for a variety of plant species  <cit> , and some plant transformation protocols have been specifically optimized based on these vectors. therefore, the generation of pcambia-based crispr/cas <dig> binary vectors enhances the compatibility of these vectors with some optimized plant transformation protocols and/or the habits or preferences of some researchers. an important improvement in each of the pcambia-derived vectors is that the bsai site in the pvs <dig> region  was disrupted in order to enable the use of bsai sites to assemble grna expression cassettes .figure  <dig>

in order to integrate multiple grnas into a single binary vector for multiplex genome editing, we constructed six grna module vectors, including three designed for dicots and three designed for monocots . using these grna module vectors, two to more grna expression cassettes could easily be assembled using the golden gate cloning method  <cit>  or the gibson assembly method  <cit> . by employing more suitable pol iii promoters, additional grna modules can be constructed for the assembly of more grna expression cassettes. therefore, the grna module vector set is extensible and can easily be updated.figure  <dig>

validation of the crispr/cas <dig> toolkit in maize protoplasts
to validate the toolkit and to compare the mutation efficiency of different cas <dig> or pol iii promoters used to drive the grnas, we generated two sets of test vectors targeting the same maize genomic dna site . one set comprises pbun201-zt <dig>  pbun301-zt <dig>  and pbun401-zt <dig>  which harbor different cas <dig> sequences, including hcas9-nls-3 × flag in pbun201-zt <dig>  3 × flag-nls-hcas9-nls in pbun301-zt <dig> and 3 × flag-nls-zcas9-nls in pbun401-zt <dig>  the hcas <dig> and zcas <dig> sequences are human-codon and zea mays-codon optimized cas <dig>  respectively. another set comprises pbun401-zt <dig>  pbun411-zt <dig>  and pbun421-zt <dig>  these vectors differ based on the pol iii promoters used to drive the grna: atu6-26p in pbun401-zt <dig>  osu3p in pbun411-zt <dig> and tau3p in pbun421-zt <dig> 

for the target site zt <dig>  the mutated alleles were examined via xcmi digestion of the pcr fragments surrounding the putative cleavage site . xcmi analysis indicated that maize codon-optimized cas <dig> performed considerably better than the two human codon-optimized cas <dig> genes . the tau <dig> promoter appeared to perform slightly better than the osu <dig> promoter, and the osu <dig> promoter performed much better than the atu6- <dig> promoter .figure  <dig>

to verify mutation events, the pcr products were cloned, and the resulting colonies were screened by colony pcr and xcmi digestion of the colony pcr products. dna from clones whose colony pcr products were resistant to xcmi digestion was sequenced . interestingly, we obtained eight insertional mutations, including one derived from hcas <dig> from the vector and seven from the ubiquitin promoter, which were presumably derived from the degraded vector rather than the maize genome . these results suggest that the efficiency of targeted integration is relatively high when donor genes are provided.

validation of the crispr/cas <dig> toolkit in transgenic maize
to test the targeted mutation efficiency of the toolkit in monocots, we generated a pcambia-derived crispr/cas <dig> binary vector with two grna expression cassettes targeting the two adjacent sites of the same maize gene, zmhkt <dig> . we analyzed 20 t <dig> transgenic lines by restriction enzyme digestion of a pcr fragment spanning the two target sites, finding that more than 60% of the transgenic lines had a mutation efficiency of approximately 100% for both target sites . we cloned and sequenced the pcr fragments from two lines with a mutation efficiency of approximately 100%, finding that sequences between the two target sites were deleted, as shown in figure 4d. these results indicate that the toolkit can be used for high efficiency targeted mutation in maize and possibly other crops.figure  <dig>

validation of the crispr/cas <dig> toolkit in arabidopsis for the generation of mutants with multiple gene mutations
two vectors, p2gr-tri-a and p2gr-tri-b , each carrying two grnas targeting three genes related to trichome development, were used to transform arabidopsis. both vectors contain the same grna , which targets etc <dig> and possibly cpc, a much less favorable target . the vectors also contain different grnas . the 18-bp target sequence in t1a-tc is reversely complementary to that in t1b-tc. both t1a-tc and t1b-tc target the same two genes: try and cpc . there is only one mismatch between the 20-nt target of t1a-tc grna and try or cpc and between that of t1b-tc and try, whereas there are two mismatches between that of t1b-tc and cpc . for p2gr-tri-a, more than 70% of the t <dig> transgenic plants displayed highly clustered trichomes , as expected for try cpc double or try cpc etc <dig> triple mutant plants  <cit> . for p2gr-tri-b, less than 10% of the plants displayed the expected phenotypes, which suggests that t1b-tc has a much less favorable performance level than t1a-tc. sequencing of the mutated alleles from a p2gr-tri-b t <dig> transgenic line revealed that although the mutation efficiency of the try allele was more than 90%, that of cpc resulting from the same t1b-tc grna was only 42% . by contrast, both cpc and try targeted by the same t1a-tc grna had similar mutation frequencies , regardless of the fact that there were different pams between the two target sites . these results suggest that the two mismatches might explain the poor performance of t1b-tc, although the two mismatches are located at the 5’-end of the grna. furthermore, when there were three mismatches between the 20-nt target sequence of t2-etc <dig> grna and the targeted gene cpc , no mutation was detectable in more than  <dig> clones from the p2gr-tri-a transgenic line. by contrast, etc <dig> from the same t2-etc <dig> grna had a mutation efficiency of 72% . these results indicate that in planta, the crispr/cas <dig> system has high sequence specificity, and two or more mismatches can greatly reduce the targeting efficiency and off-target effects, especially when a mismatch is near the 3′-end of the 20-nt target of a grna.figure  <dig>

there were many different mutated alleles in a single transgenic plant , which suggests that the crispr/cas <dig> functioned after the division of fertilized eggs. to confirm that germline transmission of the mutations into t <dig> plants is possible, we examined the transmission of mutations of five p2gr-tri-a t <dig> transgenic lines with strong phenotypes. since cas <dig> and grna are constitutively expressed in t <dig> transgenic lines, it is sometimes difficult to determine the sources of mutations, which might have arisen from germ cells or somatic cells. on the contrary, mutations from separated t <dig> nontransgenic plants must result from germline transmission of the mutations from t <dig> plants. therefore, we focused on segregated nontransgenic t <dig> plants to simplify analysis of germline transmission of the mutations. the nontransgenic plants were identified by pcr counterselection with three primer pairs, including two for the hygromycin-resistance gene and one for cas <dig>  we determined the biallelic mutations for both try and cpc based on their clustered trichome phenotypes, finding that the try and cpc mutations were transmitted to t <dig> plants with high efficiency;  <dig> %, 100%,  <dig> %, 100%, and 100% of nontransgenic t <dig> plants derived from five t <dig> lines, respectively, were biallelic mutants for both try and cpc . we first analyzed etc <dig> mutations of nontransgenic t <dig> double mutant plants by directly sequencing pcr products or by sequencing dna from different clones harboring the pcr products, and we then analyzed try and cpc mutations of etc <dig> mutants verified in the first step of analysis . we found that the verified try cpc etc <dig> triple mutants could easily be differentiated from try cpc double mutants; the former plants were shorter than the latter and had upwardly curled leaves . biallelic t <dig> mutants for etc <dig> were segregated from only two t <dig> lines among the five lines examined , demonstrating that the frequency of germline transmission of the etc <dig> mutations into t <dig> plants was much lower than that of the try and cpc mutations. this result could be explained by the lower mutation frequencies of etc <dig> in t <dig> plants.table  <dig>

to further validate the toolkit in arabidopsis, we constructed a pcambia-based vector, phse-2gr-chli, carrying two grnas targeting chli <dig> and chli <dig> , which are the same as the grnas employed in a previous study  <cit> . simultaneous disruption of chli <dig> and chli <dig> led to an albino phenotype, while chli <dig> or chli <dig> single mutants displayed a pale green phenotype  <cit> . a higher ratio of t <dig> transgenic arabidopsis seedlings displayed an albino phenotype  than that reported previously , further demonstrating that the toolkit works well for arabidopsis. mutation frequencies could be enhanced further through the use of two or more grnas to target two or more target sites of the same gene. with the enhanced mutation efficiencies, somatic mutations could be more efficiently transmitted to the next generation. thus, the toolkit developed in this study could be used to generate arabidopsis mutants with high levels of efficiency and specificity.figure  <dig>

discussion
dissecting the functions of gene family members with redundant functions and analyzing epistatic relationships in genetic pathways frequently require plant mutants bearing mutations in multiple genes. the recently developed crispr/cas <dig> system provides an excellent method for genome editing  <cit> . however, to produce multiple gene mutations in plants, resources and methods for the assembly of multiple grna expression cassettes are frequently required. in this report, we describe methods used to generate grna modules and to assemble multiple grna expression cassettes using premade grna modules. these resources, comprising binary vectors and grna module vectors, are able to meet most of the requirements for use in a variety of plants under normal or complex conditions. these methods also allow researchers to customize their own grna modules and to assemble multiple grna expression cassettes for multiplex genome editing. using this kit, we found that crispr/cas <dig> could be used to knock out multiple plant genes simultaneously, and the efficiencies of multiple-gene mutations, in accordance with the “bucket effect” theory in economics, depended on the lowest mutation efficiencies of the targeted genes.

binary vectors are required for the use of crispr/cas <dig> in plants. to fuse a 20-bp target sequence to the 5′-end of the grna scaffold, it is best to use type iis restriction enzymes. although a few type iis restriction enzymes, such as arai, bbsi/bpii, bsai/eco31i, bsmbi/esp3i, bspmi/bfuai/bvei, and btgzi are commercially available, few such enzymes can be used to linearize commonly used binary vectors, such as pcambia series and ppzp series vectors  <cit> , due to the presence of one or more sites in the backbones of these vectors. for example, not including the t-dna region, the pcambia backbone contains one bsai, two bbsi, two bsmbi, two bspmi, and four btgzi sites. although no aari site can be found in the pcambia backbone, there is an aari site in the bar selectable marker gene of the t-dna region of pcambia <dig>  fortunately, despite the presence of a bsai site in the pvs <dig> replication region, which is required for plasmid propagation in agrobacterium, there are no bsai sites in commonly used elements, such as promoters including the double camv 35s promoter and the ubi <dig> promoter, or in selectable markers including kan, hyg and bar. moreover, bsai is the least expensive of the commonly used type iis restriction enzymes. for example, the price per activity unit of bsai/eco31i is only approximately 1/ <dig> that of aari . to utilize bsai to assemble grna expression cassettes into pcambia binary vectors, we disrupted the bsai site of the pvs <dig> region. thus, for the binary vector set we developed, no restriction enzyme but bsai is required for the assembly of one or more grnas.

this toolkit provides the easiest method for generating plant crispr/cas <dig> binary vectors. when constructing binary vectors carrying one or two grnas, only two 23-nt synthetic oligos  or a pcr fragment, respectively, are required, along with any of the binary vectors described in this report, to set up golden gate reactions. when constructing binary vectors carrying multiple grnas, two or more pcr fragments are required. based on either the golden gate cloning method  <cit>  or gibson assembly  <cit> , two or more pcr fragments could easily be assembled into multiple grna expression cassettes onto any of the bsai-linearized binary vectors in only one cloning step. two strategies can be used to assemble more than four grna expression cassettes, i.e., generating more grna modules with additional validated pol iii promoters, and inserting  grna expression cassettes harboring the spectinomycin-resistance gene into binary vectors that already contain four grnas followed by the assembly of additional grnas into the bsai-linearized vectors. thus, the binary vector set combined with the grna module vector set comprise an efficient, inexpensive, time-saving, user-friendly, multifaceted, extensible toolkit for the generation of crispr/cas <dig> binary vectors carrying one or more grnas for targeted mutations of multiple genes.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a crispr/cas9-based binary vector set and a grna module vector set as a toolkit for multiplex genome editing in plants. we validated the kit using maize protoplasts, maize transgenic lines, and arabidopsis transgenic lines and found that it exhibited high efficiency and specificity. the binary vector set combined with the grna module vector set comprise an efficient, inexpensive, time-saving, user-friendly, multifaceted, extensible toolkit for the generation of crispr/cas <dig> binary vectors carrying one or more grnas for targeted mutations of multiple plant genes. this toolkit, which facilitates transient or stable expression of crispr/cas <dig> in a variety of plant systems, can be applied to a variety of plants and is especially useful for high-efficiency generation of mutants bearing multiple gene mutations.
