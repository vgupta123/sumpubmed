BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  are a family of integral-membrane proteins  that transduce chemical and optical signals through the cell membrane  <cit>  leading to the activation of g proteins, which in turn trigger a wide range of biological events  <cit> . gpcrs share a conserved structure consisting of seven transmembrane α-helices, as determined by a variety of methodologies including electron cryo-microscopy  <cit>  and x-ray diffraction  <cit> . detailed structural knowledge of gpcr structure is of interest in part because they are prime targets for therapeutic agents  <cit> . a number of web sites provide theoretical models and other information on gpcrs. for example, at gpcrdb , diverse data on gpcrs, including close to  <dig> structural models, have been collected and organized  <cit> .

several modelling approaches have been used to construct three-dimensional models of gpcrs and can be classified broadly into two categories: those using structural templates  <cit>  and those using de novo approaches  <cit> .

low- and high-resolution structures of bacteriorhodopsin  have been used as templates for modeling the structures of gpcrs because of the seven transmembrane regions and the similarity of mechanism of activation of br to that of rhodopsin. however, there are many assumptions inherent in the use of br as a template. for example, although br and rhodopsin are activated by light, br functions as a proton pump  <cit>  whilst rhodopsin is coupled to a g protein  <cit> . the sequence identity between br and rhodopsin is low  and a comparison of the high-resolution structures of br and rhodopsin reveals different helix bundle arrangements  <cit> . modelling of gpcrs based on alignment with the structure of br may, therefore, be error prone  <cit> . nevertheless, many 3d models of gpcrs have been generated based on the structure of br, such as those of the receptors for dopamine, adrenalin, serotonin, acetylcholine  <cit> , vasopressin v <dig>  <cit> , opioids  <cit> , guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein  <cit> , human thromboxane a <dig>  <cit> , 5-ht2b  <cit>  and galanin  <cit> .

the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin, solved to a resolution of  <dig>  Å, represents the first high-resolution structure of a gpcr  <cit> . since then, this crystal structure has been used as a template for modelling other gpcrs  <cit>  on the basis that the structure of rhodopsin represents a consensus template.

lower-resolution templates have also been used to model gpcrs. the template developed by baldwin et al. based on the electron density map of frog rhodopsin  <cit>  includes the cα positions of the  <dig> transmembrane helices as well as their extensions beyond the membrane on both sides. the sequences of  <dig> gpcrs were then examined using a consensus approach, based on residue conservation and hydrophobicity analysis of amino acids, and projected into the plane of the membrane to postulate several structural features of the family, including the location of the transmembrane segments within a sequence, transmembrane lengths and extensions beyond the membrane, and orientations of the helices with respect to one another. strahs and weinstein have modelled opioid receptors using comparative and molecular dynamics studies in which the transmembrane helix bundles were assembled on this baldwin template  <cit> . luteinizing hormone  <cit> , α1b-adrenergic  <cit>  and type one thyrotropin-releasing hormone  <cit>  receptors are among other gpcr models based on the baldwin template. rubenstein et al. studied the mechanism of activation for β2-adrenergic receptor using molecular dynamics techniques and a biophysical model based on the baldwin template  <cit> . the template continues to be useful as a starting point for modeling gpcrs even with the release of the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin .

however, no single template appears to be appropriate for modeling the structures of all gpcrs. for example, the use of the high-resolution structure of rhodopsin as a template has recently been questioned: the model of cck <dig> receptor built based on the rhodopsin structure was unable to reproduce the experimentally observed interactions between the ligand  and the receptor model in docking approaches  <cit> . similarly, for the baldwin template, 'conserved' residues for a particular gpcr are not always present and often there is no obvious cluster of hydrophobic residues on one side of the helices to help locate them either vertically with respect to the membrane or with respect to rotation. thus, the available data suggest that the organization of the transmembrane components of gpcrs is dictated by more considerations than contained in the currently available templates, regardless of the resolution. this is not surprising, given that sequence conservation among gpcrs can be low, they have adapted to bind a large range of ligand types and sizes, and nonidealities in the structure of transmembrane segments such as kinks, unwindings and tightenings are likely to be, in many cases, gpcr-specific.

several inverse-folding methodologies have been developed to model the three-dimensional structures of proteins. these methods are based on physicochemical, as opposed to sequence homology, considerations and use potential functions frequently involving pairwise amino-acid interaction, solvent exposure, and local secondary structure. based on these criteria, the probability of finding specific residues in a particular class of environment can be estimated. the string of residues of the protein is thus converted to a string of environment classes from which compatible structures can be generated.

reverse-environment prediction of imp structure   <cit>  is a modification of the profiles-3d application, an inverse-folding methodology appropriate for water-soluble proteins  <cit> . the modification accounts for the fact that sidechains of many residues in imps are in contact with lipid rather than water. the correction ensures that lipid-exposed residues are appropriately classified with respect to their physicochemical environment. as a result, compatibility scores calculated using repimps for imps whose structures have been solved improve significantly over those calculated using profiles-3d, and there is a reduced possibility of rejecting a 3d model of an imp because the presence of a lipid environment was not included  <cit> . repimps has been used to locate the transmembrane segment in imps with a single transmembrane domain, has the potential to locate transmembrane segments in imps with multiple transmembrane domains, and can be used to assess if transmembrane segments are appropriately oriented with respect to the lipid environment and surrounding transmembrane domains  <cit> .

we highlight the value of the repimps method by applying it to models of gpcrs generated from an idealised template, the baldwin template, to test the validity of, and refine, the models with respect to helix rotation and vertical position. the method can, in principle, be applied to any low- or high-resolution gpcr template or structure, or to any multi-pass membrane protein, and potentially can be used in combination with other high-throughput methodologies to generate and refine models of imps.

RESULTS
large-scale comparative modelling of gpcrs based on the baldwin template and calculation of lipid-corrected compatibility scores and cad values
three-dimensional models were built for the  <dig> gpcrs in the database used by baldwin et al.  <cit> , which contains the coordinates of the cα atoms predicted to be part of the transmembrane segments and their helical continuations at both sides of the membrane. side-chain positions were refined as outlined in methods.

for the  <dig> gpcr models, compatibility scores were calculated using profiles-3d, which assumes an aqueous environment . the compatibility scores were also calculated using repimps  <cit> , which assumes that atoms in contact with the membrane are in a hydrophobic environment . the average lipid-corrected compatibility score using repimps was  <dig> compared to an average score of  <dig> calculated using profiles-3d. the level of improvement was not the same for all models. figure 1b shows the distribution of the improvement in the compatibility scores for individual gpcrs calculated using repimps versus the value calculated using profiles-3d. scores were also compared for individual helices as part of the whole model . for each of helices i–vii of the  <dig> gpcr models, the mean lipid-corrected compatibility scores, as calculated by repimps, were significantly higher  than the mean scores calculated using profiles 3d, as determined by paired t test.

in order to evaluate the arrangement of the helices in the helix bundle of the  <dig> models generated based on the baldwin template, the model structures were altered systematically by rotating the individual helices one at the time by 30° about the helix long axes. for each rotation, the change in the lipid-corrected compatibility score was calculated using repimps for all  <dig> gpcr models. the values were then averaged and normalized against the average score for the unchanged models .

to analyse the degree of structural difference between consecutive pairs of models after rotation of each of the helices, contact area difference  values were calculated  <cit>  and the average value for all models plotted against the rotation of individual helices . for example, helix i of the model for a particular gpcr was rotated from 0° to 30°, and then a cad comparison was performed between them. the results of the cad calculation for this change in the models of all  <dig> gpcrs were then averaged and plotted at 0°.

repimps-guided modelling of bovine rhodopsin and hgalr1
there is good agreement between the transmembrane regions of bovine rhodopsin determined from the crystal structure and the baldwin template : superposition of the model for bovine rhodopsin derived from baldwin template with the equivalent residues in the crystal structure gave an rmsd of  <dig>  Å for the  <dig> cα atoms, which suggests very similar arrangement of the helices  <cit> . for individual helices, the rmsds were largely due to nonidealities , translation perpendicular to the membrane, and helix rotation up to ~30°  <cit> . note that a small amphipathic helix is seen in the crystal structure following helix vii which is not present in the baldwin template . this helix is not predicted to be transmembrane but rather to lie on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane bilayer.

the strong similarity between the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin and the model derived from the baldwin template suggests the template remains a useful starting point for further refinement of the structures of individual gpcrs. indeed, the presence of nonidealities present in the crystal structure may be, in some cases a disadvantage since these are likely to be gpcr-specific.

we examined several in silico tools used to predict the position and number of transmembrane segments of imps and compared the results when these tools were applied to the sequence for the gpcr, hgalr <dig> . the exact locations, length and number of transmembrane segments predicted by the different tools varied. for example, toppred predicted  <dig> transmembrane segments for hgalr <dig> and the predicted location of helix vii using the various methods was, in some cases, mutually exclusive. the hydrophobicity and hydrophobicity moments of the transmembrane segments of hgalr <dig> proposed by baldwin et al.  <cit>  were also calculated   <cit> . the values of the moments were small, and consistent with values estimated for other imps  <cit> .

next, we used repimps to consider a series of possible alignments of just the transmembrane segments of hgalr <dig> mapped onto the baldwin template. the sequences used for the model building cover the sequence alignment postulated by baldwin and four alternatives deviating from the baldwin alignment by frameshifting the sequence by up to two positions in either direction, as shown for helix i of hgalr <dig> in table  <dig>  this effectively generated models in which the helices were rotated along the helix axis and translated up and/or down relative to the other helices in the bundle. using all possible combinations of the different sequences defined for the seven helices of hgalr <dig>  a total of  <dig>  models were generated.

the lipid-corrected compatibility score for the baldwin consensus model of hgalr <dig>  as determined by repimps, was  <dig> . fig. 3a shows the distribution of scores for all  <dig>  models. the mean score was  <dig>  ±  <dig> σ.  <dig> models had scores greater than two standard deviations above this mean  and were subjected to further structure refinement by searching for energetically favourable rotamers for the side chains. fig. 3b compares the lipid-corrected compatibility scores for these models before and after structure refinement. on average, structure refinement reduced the scores by a mean value of  <dig>  . the sequences of the transmembrane helices for the model of hgalr <dig> with the highest lipid-corrected compatibility score following structure refinement are shown in table  <dig> and compared with sequences derived from the baldwin template for this receptor.

the model building method and identification of the transmembrane helices using the abovementioned procedures were also applied to bovine rhodopsin, the first gpcr for which there is a crystal structure. using repimps, the baldwin model of this protein had a lipid corrected compatibility score of  <dig>  and was not among the top scoring models, whilst the best model amongst the  <dig>  models generated had a repimps score of  <dig>  and showed deviations from the model proposed by baldwin .

discussion
gpcrs are signalling molecules that traverse the cell membrane with seven helices in an anticlockwise progression as viewed from outside the cell. though much evidence suggested this overall architecture  <cit> , it was only with the first reported crystal structure of a gpcr that this was confirmed  <cit> . gpcrs bind ligands ranging from small molecules to large proteins, indicating that details of their architecture must deviate. furthermore, additional factors that affect the structure and function of gpcrs, such as dimerisation and interactions with associated proteins, have been reported  <cit> . the overall result is that no single in vivo mechanism of a gpcr has been fully characterised at the structural level.

gpcrs are considered non-standard proteins based on the most applicable methods of structure determination  <cit> , and so it is not expected that high-resolution structural data will accrue rapidly for this class of protein in the near future. for this reason, comparative protein modelling methods, which assume that a single template structure is appropriate for all members of a family, remain an important approach in modelling the structures of gpcrs and indeed all other families of imp. however, these templates, whether high- or low-resolution, should only be regarded as a starting point for determining the unique structural properties of individual members within the family. thus, in silico tools, such as those used to predict the location of transmembrane segments and to refine the structural features of the template, also remain an important feature of predictive modelling for imps.

we applied the repimps methodology to a well-known template for gpcrs, the baldwin template, to indicate that, for individual gpcrs, the rotational position of helices and their vertical positioning may differ significantly from the template. this in silico tool compares favourably with other tools in terms of predicting the location of transmembrane helices  <cit>   and can, in principle, be applied to templates from any imp family, including, for example, the high-resolution structure of the gpcr, bovine rhodopsin. the fact that so few high-resolution structures have been determined for gpcrs indicates that low-resolution templates, such as the baldwin template, will continue to play a role in predictive modelling of individual gpcrs. in addition, we have shown previously that the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin and the model of this protein derived from the baldwin template show overall structural similarity   <cit> . because of this, it is likely that both the high-resolution crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin and the baldwin template remain valid starting points for building models of individual gpcrs with the aid of in silico tools such as repimps.

starting with either the crystal structure or the baldwin template is likely to have its advantages and disadvantages. for example, the nearly idealised helices of the low-resolution template may prove useful in some respects since they lack the nonidealities of the crystal structure, such as localised unwindings, tightenings and kinks, which may well be gpcr-specific. alternatively, it may prove useful in some cases to apply repimps to models derived from the high-resolution structure in which the effects of the documented nonidealities and in silico mutations can be assessed.

improvement of the compatibility score of the baldwin template for gpcrs using repimps
we built  <dig> models of gpcrs based on the baldwin template  <cit>  and assessed them with the repimps methodology, which unlike profiles-3d from which it was derived, takes into consideration that sidechains of many residues in imps are in contact with lipid rather than water  <cit> . repimps improved the average compatibility score for all  <dig> gpcr models to  <dig>  compared to a value of  <dig> obtained with profiles-3d . the greatest improvement was seen for helices i and v which have a greater area exposed to the lipid membrane in the baldwin template . similarly, the lowest improvement of compatibility scores was observed for helices iii and vii which have the smallest area exposed to lipid. we previously demonstrated the existence of the correlation between area exposed to the solvent and the extent of the improvement of compatibility scores for a set of imp structures  <cit> .

the effects of the rotation of helices about their axis show that there are rotational steps for which the lipid-corrected compatibility score is significantly higher than that at the origin  . a higher value for a rotated helix compared to that calculated for the baldwin template at zero rotation is an indication that an alternate position for the helix is available which positions the side chains in a more compatible environment within the bilayer. this is most evident for helix vii, where it appears that for most gpcrs a rotation of 240–300° relative to the baldwin template position is the preferred orientation. alternatively, this may not be the consequence of misorientation of helix vii in the baldwin template, but rather from nonidealities similar to those seen in the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin  <cit> . nevertheless, the repimps approach suggests deficiencies in the baldwin template purely using a molecular modelling approach based on placing imps in the correct  environment.

most of the commonly used methods to evaluate the difference between a model and a reference structure are based on calculating rmsd values. however, the structural changes that we have applied to the models of gpcrs, namely the rotation of the helices, require the analysis of structural differences which are not dependent on the geometrical changes of the structure. for this reason, we used the cad method  <cit>  which measures a normalised sum of absolute differences of residue-residue contact surface areas calculated for a reference structure and a model.

the average of the cad values were used to compare a pair of models, which differed by the rotation of a single helix by 30° about the helix axis. the cad values for each helix for  <dig> models were plotted against the total rotation from the starting model as shown in figure 2c. as is clear from the figure, rotation of the helices about the helix axis did not produce major fluctuations in the values. the maximum cad value was ~ <dig>  seen for rotation of helix iii. this is in the range observed for the differences between different models of a protein derived from structures solved using nmr techniques  <cit> . because the relevance of the absolute values of the cad method is difficult to determine, we were most interested relative changes. the calculations suggested there were no rotations that produced unrealistic changes.

for a more reasonable assessment of the differences between the models as the result of rotation of the helices, the cad values were calculated for just that part of the model in which changes were made. in the case of bovine rhodopsin, the model was truncated to contain just the helix being rotated as well as those helices which are in contact with the rotated helix. in this way the average cad value for helix i increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig> . in a similar way, the cad value as a result of rotation of helix iii increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig> . these higher cad values are also in the range that one can expect for the differences between the models of a protein built based on the data from nmr spectroscopy. overall, the process of rotating helices in gpcrs does not greatly affect cad values. this provides justification for rotating helices and using repimps to assess the quality of models and the appropriate orientation of helices.

modelling of bovine rhodopsin and hgalr <dig> based on the baldwin template using repimps and different alignments of transmembrane segments
we generated  <dig>  models for both bovine rhodopsin and hgalr <dig> built using  <dig> different threads of sequences originating from each of the transmembrane regions. the models were then scored using the repimps algorithm.

the validity of the models could be further tested by experimental means such as site-directed mutagenesis. there is evidence that helix iii  <cit> , residues at the top of helices iv and vii  <cit>  and residues his <dig> and his <dig> in helix vi  <cit>  are important for galanin binding. both the model generated directly from the baldwin template and the 'refined' model generating using repimps have the his residues positioned inside the helix bundle.

with respect to bovine rhodopsin, the repimps approach identified a set of sequences for the transmembrane segments that are different from those for the model generated from the baldwin template . the repimps-based model built from these sequences shows an rmsd of  <dig>  Å to the crystal structure for  <dig> cα atom pairs of the residues indicated in table  <dig>  this rmsd value is comparable to that obtained for the model of rhodopsin proposed by shacham   <cit> , baldwin   <cit> , and yarov-yarovoy   <cit> . in our model lys <dig> is moved  <dig>  Å down in the helix axis and faces toward the binding pocket of the retinal molecule created by helices 3– <dig>  in the baldwin model, lys <dig> is facing helix  <dig>  in a direction opposite to the binding pocket. the differences between our model and the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin may be indicative of deficiencies in our method. however, the crystal structure represents just one form  of this receptor  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
repimps can be used as an in silico tool to assist in the modelling positional features of transmembrane segments of imps. the method can, in principle, be applied to any template for gpcrs as well as templates for other families of imp. here, we have applied repimps to the baldwin template of gpcrs and shown that, individually and collectively, vertical positioning and rotational orientation of the transmembrane helices can differ significantly from the template.
