BACKGROUND
firmicutes, and in particular bacillus subtilis, form spores, through a complex and well-studied differentiation to a very stable endospore, where they can survive for decades until revived; for a recent review see  <cit> . firmicutes include the genera bacillus and clostridia, which include the pathogenic agents of anthrax, tetanus and botulism, as well as one of the best-studied laboratory bacteria b. subtilis. in contrast in actinobacteria the dormant state is the most stable form, where the bacteria enter a state of very low metabolic turnover and no cell division from which they are hard to revive  <cit> . the actinobacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis  survives in granulomas in the lung for decades in the dormant state. this can be recapitulated in vitro by extended growth of stationary cultures or by hypoxia  <cit> . the physiological situations where firmicutes enter and exit a dormant state, or at least a late stationary phase state rather than undergo sporulation, are less well understood in terms of the pathogenic lifecycle than dormancy in actinobacteria. however, a dormant state in firmicutes can be recapitulated in the laboratory  <cit> . this paper describes the first structure of a group of peptidoglycan cleaving enzymes from firmicutes, called stationary phase survival proteins , that are involved in survival in the stationary phase and are analogous to the resuscitation promoting factors  from actinobacteria.

resucitation promoting factors revive actinobacteria from dormancy  <cit> . they have a conserved catalytic domain that cleaves peptidoglycan  <cit>  and structurally resembles a stripped-down version of lysozyme and lytic transglycosylases  <cit> . they vary in the ancillary domains attached to the catalytic domain. two models have been proposed for the action of rpfs, either they release a peptidoglycan fragment that acts as a signal for a receptor or the hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan leads to a physical removal of a block to cell division . recent evidence supports the peptidoglycan fragment model  <cit> .

stationary phase survival  proteins were discovered by comparison of the domain structure of m.tuberculosis rpfb with proteins from bacteria in the firmicute phylum. this search found a protein, yabe in b. subtilis, which had the same ancillary domains   <cit> . this led to the proposal of a non-orthologous domain displacement event where the overall ancillary domain architecture of rpfb, and the homology of surrounding genes, was maintained but the rpf catalytic domain was replaced by another domain widely found in firmicutes, which was named ‘stationary phase survival’  domain  <cit> . the sps domain has low, but significant, sequence similarity to the c-terminal region of mlta , which contains the 3d  domain motif, that includes the catalytic aspartate, and is consequently a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase of the mlta/3d family  <cit> .

there are five major groups of sps proteins in firmicutes based on their domain structure  <cit> . the spsa group, which includes the b.subtilis protein yoch, contains two lysm domains as well as the sps domain. lysm domains bind peptidoglycan and are found in a range of proteins including some rpf proteins, amongst which is the first rpf to be discovered from m.luteus  <cit> . spsb group are the proteins that resemble rpfb in ancillary domain structure. yuic is a member of the spsc group which, like rpfc  <cit> , rpfd and rpfe, only has a signal peptide and short extensions beyond the conserved catalytic domain. the spsd group contains a cog <dig> domain, only found in putative peptidoglycan cleaving enzymes in firmicutes, in addition to the catalytic domain. there is no example of this group in b.subtilis, nor of the spse group that contain two sh3b domains, again found in peptidoglycan cleaving enzymes, as well as the catalytic domain. b.subtilis does have a fourth sps protein yorm located on a phage in the chromosome, which are classed in a minor group  <cit> .

ravagnani et al.  <cit>  proposed that the sps proteins were not involved in spore formation and germination, but in the prolonged survival of these bacteria in stationary phase prior to spore formation. studies have looked at the effect of deleting the archetypal sps from b. subtilis, yoch  <cit> , and deleting both sps proteins in listeria monocytogenes  <cit> . shah and dworkin  <cit>  showed the yoch was induced by muropeptides, via the ser/thr kinase prkc, was active in degrading peptidoglycan in a zymogram and that deletion of yoch compromised survival in stationary phase, which could be rescued by other bacteria secreting yoch. however, yoch is only one of three genomic sps proteins in b. subtilis . pinto et al.  <cit>  showed that knockouts of the sps proteins in l. monocytogenes extend the lag phase for growth on minimal medium, but have no effect on rate or duration of growth in the exponential phase. recently a dormant state was shown in the pathogenic firmicute, staphylococcus aureus, that could be revived by culture supernatant, analogous to the behaviour of actinobacteria. however, the paper did not directly show that an sps protein was the active factor  <cit> .

in this paper we present three high-resolution crystal structures of yuic, an sps protein from b. subtilis. these are of the apo-enzyme , of the enzyme with a monosaccharide, n-acetylglucosamine  bound in part of the active site  and with a  <dig> -anhydro-n-acetylglucosmaine-n-acetylglucosmaine disaccharide product  arising from incubation of the enzyme with penta-n-acetyl-penta-glucosamine . this defines for the first time the boundaries of the sps domain and confirms that it is a minimal catalytically active version of the mlta structure. this structural simplicity is analogous to that of the rpf domain being a minimal version of the slt/lysozyme fold.

RESULTS
protein expression and structure solution
b. subtilis yuic 32– <dig> , which lacks only the predicted signal peptide, was purified after cytosolic expression in e. coli. this protein ran as two peaks on gel filtration corresponding to probable monomer and dimer fractions based on the elution volume . the sample also showed partial proteolysis to give a lower molecular weight band on sds-page . peptide mapping by mass spectrometry indicated that this was likely to be cleavage at or close to r <dig> based on the sequence found in the uniprot database. nmr spectroscopy of the truncated fragment indicated that there was loss of a series of sharp peaks in the amide region compared to a full-length sample, consistent with loss of an unstructured region at the n-terminus . subsequent n-terminal truncated constructs , designed to remove the disordered regions of the protein, still ran with two peaks on gel filtration. so far only the first-eluting gel filtration  peak ever produced crystals of any construct.

three structures of yuic have been solved by molecular replacement based on distant homology to e. coli mlta . two are in space group r <dig> with two chains forming a tight dimer in the asymmetric unit. both structures contain ligands bound to both chains. one contains the partial substrate n-acetylglucosamine  . the other  was grown in the presence of penta-nag , but with clear density in each chain for a  <dig> -anhydro-n-acetylglucosamine- <dig> -n-acetylglucosamine disaccharide; the expected product of cleavage of a nag oligosaccharide substrate. the other structure has no ligand and was solved in space group c <dig> with a single chain in the asymmetric unit  . the apo structure forms a similar dimer to that seen in the r <dig> structure . details of the data collection and refinement are given in table  <dig> table  <dig> data collection and refinement statistics

fold analysis
the overall fold of each domain of the symmetric dimer consists of a mixed direction six stranded double psi beta barrel surround by five helices . in all the structures, the final two helices and the last strand of the beta barrel of each half are supplied by the other chain in the dimer. this appears to be a classical example of crystallographic domain swapping as defined by eisenberg  <cit> . it is likely, and certainly topologically possible, that in the monomeric form seen in solution the last strand  and final helices  of the domain are provided by the same chain. these three secondary structural elements then swap to form a dimer at higher protein concentrations .fig.  <dig> structure of yuic and comparison with mlta. a dimer of yuic with nag bound. chain a is in magenta and chain b in blue with the positions of starts and ends of secondary structure elements labelled. nag is ball and stick with carbon in green, oxygen in red and nitrogen in blue. the distance between the ca of g <dig> of each chain is shown in Å. b structural superposition of yuic structure backbones. +nag chains in magenta and blue with ligand in green, +anhydro chains in red and pale crimson and ligand in dark purple. apo chains in green and yellow. c structural superposition of + nag yuic in cyan  and blue   and mlta from e.coli   <cit>  in gold. lower picture is 90° rotation around horizontal of upper. the distance between a <dig> and b <dig> of yuic is shown in Å. d sequence alignment based on the structural superposition in c with secondary structure elements labelled, conserved aspartates shown in green and other conserved residues shown in red. g <dig>  where the domain swap is centred, is coloured yellow and labelled. structural superposition used ssm  <cit>  in ccp4mg  <cit> , structural alignment generated by ucsf chimera  <cit> , structures drawn with ccp4mg  <cit>  and alignment with espript  <cit> 



the domain swapping is probably enabled by the ability of g <dig> to adopt the necessary phi-psi angles to allow either monomer or dimer to form. g <dig> lies at the end of the third helix. the cas of g <dig> in the two chains are only  <dig>  Å apart , so movement of a single helix to an “average” position in the monomer is plausible. most of the dimer interface interactions would be found in a monomer, the exceptions are the interface between the two copies of the third helix . taking just the residues 166– <dig> from the two chains of + nag using pisa  <cit>  316 Å <dig> is buried between the two helices and surrounding linkers with no additional hydrogen bonds or salt bridges definitely formed in the dimer compared to two separate monomers. this compares to 3955 Å <dig> in the total interface between the a and b chains. two hydrogen bonds are formed from residues in this swapping region to other parts of the second chain. e <dig> side chain forms a hydrogen bond to t  <dig> very close to c-terminus of the other chain, and would presumably maintain this link in the monomer. the hydroxyl of y <dig> forms a hydrogen bond to glu <dig> in the other chain. it would take a movement of about 5 Å, rotating the helix in the right direction to bring g <dig> to the position of g <dig> in the other chain, for this to be an intrachain rather than an interchain hydrogen bond. this indicates that the dimer should only be slightly more stable than the monomer.

the two ligand bound structures have good electron density for all residues, and superimpose very well with a rmsd  <dig>  Å over  <dig> ca atoms of the dimer or  <dig>  Å over  <dig> ca atoms of the pseudo monomer  . the apo structure is locally less ordered than the substrate bound structures, lacking density for residues 97– <dig> and for four residues at the c-terminus compared to the + nag structure, which just misses one residue at the c-terminus. otherwise, the apo form of the pseudo monomer superposes well onto the + nag structure with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> ca atoms for the pseudo monomer. the domain swapped dimers superimpose less well with the rmsd for the apo dimer vs + nag of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> ca atoms as a consequence of flexibility in the positioning of the pseudo monomers within the dimer. the domain swapped dimer corresponds to a two-fold axis parallel to the third helix which lies at the centre of the dimer interface. in the apo crystals, the two fold axis is crystallographic.

if one pair of pseudo monomers is superimposed between apo and + nag, it requires a rotation of 26° and a translation of 6 Å along a screw axis perpendicular to the third helix to superimpose the second pair of monomers  starts at residue  <dig> just before the third helix, however the two residues with very large phi/psi angle changes between liganded and apo structures, where most of the movement arises are g <dig>  and k <dig> . the flexibility of g <dig> agrees with, but does not prove, our proposal that a major rearrangement at this residue will generate the non-domain swapped monomer. the nz of k <dig> in the apo structure forms hydrogen bonds to both the main chain and side chain carbonyls of n <dig>  whereas in the liganded structures this side chain is pointing in to solvent. whether this is the cause of the phi/psi angle at this residue is not clear. the region 176– <dig> lies away from the sugar binding site, so the change is not a direct result of ligand binding. however the other end of the third helix lies quite close to the ligand binding site and the loop that becomes ordered on ligand binding, so the difference in domain position may be propagated from sugar binding. however, it is also possible that changes in crystal packing may be the sole cause of the difference in the position of the second monomer seen in the apo structure.

comparison to mlta
mlta    <cit>  is defined as a single domain in scop, but as two domains in cath -  the barwin-like endoglucanase beta barrel, formed by a section from the n terminus   and the c terminal region  , and an unclassified domain . mlta superimposes on the yuic  structure with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> of the  <dig> modelled residues  in the pseudo monomer . this is entirely within the beta barrel domain of mlta, which is  <dig> residues long and is slightly longer than the ordered region of yuic . overall yuic resembles closely the barwin-like endoglucanase beta barrel of mlta, but instead of the second  <dig> residue domain of mlta, yuic just has a  <dig> residue loop linking the two sections of the barrel. all the beta strands of yuic have equivalents in mlta . the first strand and adjacent peptide of yuic  is overlapped by the second and third strands of the mlta , which has an eight residue loop between the two strands that does not superimpose with yuic. there is no equivalent of the first strand and helix of mlta in yuic. where the cath barwin-like endoglucanase domain of mlta begins again , the backbone is very close to yuic  in a small hairpin in both structures. the second to fifth strands of yuic superimpose with the tenth to thirteenth of yuic. before the final strand of the beta barrel both have helices, which do not superimpose well. the yuic helix at this point, α <dig>  is where the domain swap begins. the final strand of the beta barrel  is formed by the last strand of yuic from the other chain in the domain swap and is equivalent to the last strand  of mlta. yuic then has a pair of helices, which are close in space to the helices at the n-terminus of mlta but are not structurally equivalent.

ligand binding
crystallisation of yuic in the presence of nag gives a structure with a single well defined nag per chain. incubation of yuic with 5 mm penta-nag in the crystallisation results in two linked sugars in the final structure per chain. one of the sugars is a nag that occupies the same − <dig> site as the sugar in the crystals grown in the presence of nag monomer. the second sugar has clearly formed a  <dig> -anhydro reaction product. the interactions of these compounds with yuic are shown in fig. 2a and b and discussed more fully below. peptidoglycan consists of chains of alternating n-acetylglucosmine  and n-acetylmuramic acid  sugars, cross-linked with peptide chains. the two sugars differ at the o <dig> position, where nam has a lactate, which then links to the crosslinking peptide, whereas nag just has an oh. this means that nam is much more bulky at the o <dig> position, which often confers the selectivity in cleavage.fig.  <dig> interactions with ligands for yuic and mlta. a interaction of yuic  with nag  . b interaction of yuic  with  <dig> -anhydrodisaccharide . 2fo-fc electron density for the ligand at  <dig>  sigma shown clipped to  <dig>  Å around the ligand. c interaction of mlta  with hexachitose    <cit> . 2pi <dig> is a d308a mutation to prevent catalysis so d <dig>  from the superposed active mlta  is shown  <cit> . a-c are superimposed views d superposition of yuic  with mlta  showing the superposition of substrates hexachitose  and the  <dig> -anhydrodisaccharide . this shows the ligands overlapping at the − <dig> and − <dig> sites. the sidechains of the three conserved aspartates giving rise to the 3d domain name are also shown. e the potential clash of the ends of a hexachitose in the yuic structure showing the + <dig> nag of mlta  clashing with chain b domain swapping helix  and the − <dig> nag clashing with a symmetry related copy of yuic in the lattice . diagrams drawn with ccp4mg  <cit> 



the structure of the catalytically inactive d308a mlta with chitohexose  <cit>   has six clearly defined nag sugars, four, − <dig> to − <dig>  on the non-reducing end before the cleaved bond and two, + <dig> and + <dig>  at the reducing end. the nag in + nag superimposes with the − <dig> position in the chitohexose in mlta. the anhydro sugar lies at the − <dig> position and the unmodified nag lies at the − <dig> position in the disaccharide reaction product. the interaction of the conserved d <dig> /d <dig>  with the n of the n-acetyl group of the nag at the − <dig> position is conserved . further hydrogen bonds to this sugar in yuic are from the non-conserved k <dig> nz to the n-acetyl carbonyl and o <dig> of nag. mlta does not have any atoms near k <dig> nz in the superposition and k <dig> lies in the yuic insert that replaces a whole domain in mlta. the oh of s <dig> in mlta does form an h bond to the −2 n-acetyl carbonyl, but lies  <dig>  Å from k102nz in the superposition and does not also interact with o <dig>  and there is a water  in the yuic structure at the position of the mlta s <dig> oh.table  <dig> list of hydrogen bonds between protein and substrates and conservation in mlta



more generally there is good conservation of the backbone on the d <dig> side of the sugar, but little conservation on the other face. the o <dig> hydroxyl in the − <dig> position forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone carboxyl of l <dig>  which would prevent there being a n-acetylmuramicacid  at this position. nam can easily be accommodated at the − <dig> position as the o <dig> of the sugar, which has the lactic acid group in nam and then the peptide in peptidoglycan, is pointing into the solvent. the − <dig> site in mlta has a hydrogen bond to the main chain carboxyl of residue v <dig> from the o <dig> hydroxyl . this backbone position is conserved in yuic, but the hydroxyl has moved away to form the anhydro product and so this contact is lost in the product. the n of the n-acetyl group is interacting with the main chain carboxyl of v <dig> in mlta. this is roughly equivalent in position to the carbonyl of s <dig> in yuic + anhydro structure, which forms a similar interaction, despite the overall fold not being conserved in this region. the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group of the − <dig> sugar in the yuic + anhydro product interacts with two main chain nh groups , which are conserved in mlta , although the carbonyl also interacts with the side chain oh of s <dig> in yuic, which is an extra interaction compared to mlta. in mlta the acetyl carbonyl is further away and the interaction with g300/a <dig> is water mediated. without a product structure for mlta or an uncleaved substrate in yuic it is impossible to determine whether the differences in binding are due to substrate/product differences or protein differences.

the superposition of the mlta sugars allows us to look more widely at possible sugar binding sites in yuic. intriguingly there is only room for one sugar site on the vacant + side of the cleavage in the + nag and anhydro structure. the + <dig> sugar in the mlta superposition clashes with the third  helix backbone . this would prevent the sugar chain being longer than + <dig> and so the dimer could only remove a terminal nag . however the movement of the second pseudo monomer of the domain swapped dimer in the apo structure described above, displaces the third helix away from this position so that this clash is reduced to ends of side chains, which could adopt other positions. this probably would allow cleavage within a chain  in the dimer as well, and certainly allow removal of disaccharides as seen in many lytic transglycosidases. in the pseudo monomer, the block from the helix probably does not occur and the active site is much more open so the monomer is likely to be able to cleave in either an endo or exo mode.

the main interactions with the + <dig> sugar in mlta are formed by residues v <dig> and q <dig>  which lies in the inserted domain in cath that is not present in yuic. however, the hydroxyl of s <dig> of yuic, which is part of the much more direct link that replaces the inserted domain, lies close to the position of the q <dig> side chain of mlta and could potentially hydrogen bond to o <dig> of the + <dig> sugar. there is not much space round the superimposed + <dig> o <dig> hydroxyl in yuic and so the + <dig> position is likely to be specific to nag and not able to house a nam residue.

although we can only clearly see two sugars in the product, potentially a third may be present in the anhydro product in a disordered state. the regions of mlta that interact with the − <dig> and − <dig> sugars in mlta are not homologous with yuic. the superimposed − <dig> sugar of mlta collides with a symmetry related molecule of yuic  suggesting that a product with four sugars would not bind in the lattice. intriguingly this would be the obvious product of the penta-nag in the yuic dimer r <dig> crystal as the + <dig> position is also sterically blocked. it is hard to envisage yuic having any positive interaction with a sugar in the − <dig> position as the protein does not extend out that far. despite being larger, mlta only has limited interaction with the sugar at the − <dig> position. careful inspection of the − <dig> site indicate some waters are in positions likely to be where hydroxyls of the sugar would be positioned, but if it is present the sugar is either much more mobile or much less occupied due to cleavage at a mixture of positions in the penta-nag. it is more likely that multiple cleavage events before crystals formed have led to a predominant two sugar anhydro product and this form bound to the dimer may have been preferentially selected by the lattice.

catalytic activity
the conserved aspartates of the 3d domain, the pfam annotation of yuic , superimpose well with the equivalent residues in mlta. yuic d <dig> is equivalent to mlta d <dig> ; yuic d <dig> to mlta d261and yuic d <dig> to mlta d <dig>  no equivalent atoms are further than  <dig>  Å apart and all cas within  <dig>  Å.

the conserved d <dig> is the catalytic carboxylate and is orientated by t <dig> which is conserved in mlta  . a number of proposed mechanisms for mlta have been put forward. in the preferred mechanism of van straaten et al.  <cit>  the catalytic aspartate residue is proposed to protonate the leaving hydroxyl at the + <dig> position and deprotonate the o <dig> hydroxyl, which attacks a carbenium ion intermediate to form the anhydro product. it is proposed in mlta that the carbenium ion is stabilised by the α <dig> helix dipole. this helix lies in the inserted domain which has no equivalent in yuic. however in the + nag and anhydro product structures the nearest residues to the position of the helix in the superposed mlta are e <dig> and s <dig>  the main chain carboxyl of s <dig> is hydrogen bonding to the n of the n-acetyl group of the − <dig> anhydrosugar with the side chain of e <dig> pointing away towards the side chain of t <dig>  however the stretch of residues from  <dig> to  <dig> is disordered in the apo structure indicating that these residues are flexible and therefore e <dig> may be able to rearrange and act as a second carboxylate in the reaction mechanism, either just to stabilise the carbenium ion as the dipole is proposed to do in mlta, or opening up the possibility of a two carboxylate mechanism analogous to the retaining lysozymes.fig.  <dig> schematic of the yuic active site showing the conservation with mlta. the lower barrel side shows significant conservation to mlta including the conserved catalytic aspartate and the residues allowing mechanism  <dig> of powell et al.  <cit> . the upper face is not conserved. substrate assisted catalysis is unlikely because s <dig>  which is unique to yuic is holding the acetyl carbonyl in the wrong place for this mechanism. the helix from mlta  is thought to stabilise the carbenium ion. it is possible that the helix from yuic  may play a similar role or release e <dig> to act as a second carboxylate, as 97– <dig> are disordered in the apo structure indicating flexibility in this region. the two helices are shown in their superimposed positions. where two numbers are given the first is b.subtilis yuic and the second e.coli mlta 



substrate assisted catalysis has also been proposed for mlta  <cit> . this would require the − <dig> sugar n-acetyl oxygen to be on the opposite face of the substrate from the o <dig> that generates the anhydrosugar. however in yuic the − <dig> sugar n-acetyl group oxygen of the anhydro product is interacting with s <dig> and is on the same face as the o <dig> oxygen would be. unless the s <dig> interaction is only formed in the product then substrate assisted catalysis using the n-acetyl group is unlikely, as a very large rearrangement of the n-acetyl group is required to place it in position to assist in substrate catalysis from its position in the product structure. all the homologous residues for the second mechanism of powell et al.  <cit>  involving y <dig> and d <dig> of yuic acting in the same way as proposed for y <dig> and d <dig> of n. gonnorrhoeae mlta to abstract the proton from the o <dig> to promote nucleophilic attack on the carbenium to form the anhydro product.

is the monomer or the dimer the true structure?
zymograms indicate that protein from both peaks of the gel filtration are enzymatically active and can degrade peptidoglycan after refolding after sds-page . however, this does not demonstrate which oligomeric states are active as the refolding from the unfolded monomer in the gel could have led to either, or a mixture of both, oligomeric states. a native gel shows no major difference in apparent size or activity of the samples originating from the monomer and dimer peaks , probably the very high concentration in the stacking gel has driven the protein largely into the dimer state. there are some other higher oligomer bands that are also active, particularly from the monomer peak.fig.  <dig> zymograms of yuic. a sds-page and b denaturing zymogram of yuic_p <dig> and yuic_r <dig> constructs. lane 1: yuic_p73-e <dig> dimer, 2: yuic_p73-e <dig> monomer, 3: yuic_p73-k <dig> dimer, 4: yuic_p73-k <dig> monomer, m: pageruler prestained protein ladder, 5: yuic_r52-e <dig> peak  <dig> , 6: yuic_r52-e <dig> peak  <dig> , 7: yuic_r52-e <dig> peak  <dig> , 8: yuic_r52-k <dig> peak  <dig> , 9: yuic_r52-k <dig> peak  <dig> , 10: yuic_r52-k <dig> . c native-page and d native zymogram of yuic_p <dig> constructs. lane 1: lysozyme, m: nativemark unstained protein standard, 2: yuic_p73-e <dig> dimer, 3: yuic_p73-e <dig> monomer, 4: yuic_p73-k <dig> dimer, 5: yuic_p73-k <dig> monomer, 6: negative control . positions of the principal bands in the native zymogram are marked with red arrows as they are faint



the domain swapped dimer seen in the crystal may be an artefact of high level expression in the e.coli cytosol and high concentrations used for structural studies, however, we have no direct evidence for this. nevertheless, both the monomer and dimer are stable species. rerunning samples of either peak, after being frozen for some weeks, gives a single peak with a similar retention volume on gel filtration as when first run . this indicates that both states are stable and there is at best very slow kinetic interchange between the two.

it is pure speculation as to what the oligomeric state is in b.sutbtilis in vivo. a mixture of the two states is possible, particularly as both are kinetically stable and probably active. highly expressing protein in the cytoplasm of e.coli is different from an unknown level of expression of secreted protein in b.subtilis, so the distribution seen in our experiments may not reflect nature. furthermore yuic may interact with the cell wall or other enzymes through the disordered region at the n-terminus, which could influence its ability to oligomerise. peptidoglycan remodelling enzymes are known to interact. rpfb and rpfe bind to ripa and there is synergy in cleavage seen between the two . indeed rpfb and ripa assemble into a larger complex with pbp <dig> at the poles septum  <cit> . the assembly of multiple peptidoglycan enzymes is a theme also seen in gram-negative e. coli  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the structure of yuic from b. subtilis has shown that the stationary phase survival  proteins are smaller versions of the mlta family of lytic transglycosylases. this structural simplification is analogous to that of the resuscitation promoting factors in actinobacteria being reduced versions of lysozyme and slt proteins  <cit> . indeed there is conservation of ancillary domains between groupings of the rpfs and the sps and in some cases synteny in the surrounding operons  <cit> .

our structural work has shown that the sps protein family is indeed homologous to mlta, but a more compact, perhaps minimal, version of the enzyme. we have also trapped an  <dig> -anhydrosugar product in the active site, showing that formation of a  <dig> -anhydrosaccharide is the product of the reaction. the analogy with the resuscitation promoting factors of actinomycetes supports the role of these proteins in stationary phase survival of the firmicutes.
