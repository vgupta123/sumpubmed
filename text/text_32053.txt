BACKGROUND
the classic model of sex chromosome evolution begins with the emergence of a new sex- determining gene on an autosome
 <cit> . the new sex-determiner may be linked with genes experiencing sexually antagonistic selection. selection favors mechanisms, such as chromosomal inversions, that reduce recombination between the sex-determination locus and sexually antagonistic genes
 <cit> . the human sex chromosomes have undergone at least four such inversions, which may have limited recombination between the sex-determination locus and nearby sexually antagonistic genes
 <cit> .

inversions create a clonally inherited chromosomal segment with a relatively small effective population size when compared to the rest of the genome
 <cit> . sex chromosomes therefore become a haven for deleterious mutations and repetitive elements that are difficult to purge. these deleterious mutations accumulate via muller’s ratchet, as well as by hitchhiking with advantageous mutations
 <cit> . degradation of functional genes on the y- or w-chromosome leaves the homogametic sex carrying two functional copies of a particular gene, while the heterogametic sex carries only one functional copy. therefore, mechanisms are needed to maintain appropriate expression of dosage-sensitive genes on emerging sex chromosomes
. in mammals, global dosage compensation is accomplished through x-inactivation
 <cit> . however, in many species, dosage compensation is partial and the expression of many genes is not compensated
 <cit> .

some sex-determining genes are conserved for long periods of time. an example is sry, a gene that has controlled sex-determination in therian mammals for approximately  <dig> million years
. other sex-determination genes hold sway for much shorter periods of time. there have been at least five transitions in the mechanism controlling sex-determination in rice fish  during the last  <dig> million years
 <cit> . similarly rapid rates of sex chromosome evolution have been identified among sticklebacks 
 <cit> .

the evolution of new sex-determination genes may have contributed to the rapid radiation of african cichlid fishes
 <cit> . among the closely related haplochromine cichlids of lake malawi, sex-determination regions have been localized to linkage groups  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> 
. among tilapia cichlids, sex-determination regions have been localized to linkage groups  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> 
 <cit> . multiple sex-determination genes often segregate within a single species
 <cit> . the blue tilapia, oreochromis aureus, segregates both an xy system on linkage group  <dig> and a zw system on linkage group 3
 <cit> . some strains of the nile tilapia, o. niloticus, have an xy system on linkage group  <dig>  while others segregate an xy system on linkage group 23
 <cit> .

the goal of this study was to characterize the sex-determination locus on linkage group  <dig> in o. niloticus. we took a family-based strategy, separately pooling males and females from two crosses, and performing whole genome sequencing on the pooled dnas. we cataloged the density and frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and assessed their functional impact. we identified an  <dig>  mb block of differentiation suggestive of a y-linked inversion on linkage group  <dig>  we found high densities of functionally significant snps within this differentiated block. analysis of gonadal transcriptomes demonstrated an enrichment of female-biased gene models within the inversion, which suggests that dosage compensation is incomplete in this strain of o. niloticus.

RESULTS
sequencing of male and female dna pools
we obtained ~ <dig> million reads from the pool of male dna and ~ <dig> million reads from the pool of female dna.  <dig> % of the male and  <dig> % of the female reads were aligned to the o. niloticus reference genome. genome-wide coverage was slightly lower in males , compared to females .

large block of divergence on linkage group 1
the mean fst between the male- and female-pooled genomes at polymorphic sites over the entire genome was  <dig>  . a region between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb on linkage group  <dig> showed a substantially higher value of fst =  <dig>   . this region corresponds to the previously mapped sex-determination region in this strain of o. niloticus
. mean read coverage within the differentiated region was lower in males , compared to females , but this difference was consistent with the total number of reads obtained from each sex. we used fisher’s exact test to determine whether the allele frequency of snps was significantly different between males and females. we found a cluster of highly significant snps within the differentiated block on linkage group  <dig> .figure  <dig>

we also counted the number of positions per  <dig> kb window that were fixed in female pools and had a snp in intermediate frequency in male pools, as would be consistent with females having two x chromosomes and males having an x and a y chromosome, using sex_snp_finder_now.pl. there were  <dig>  of these snps found across the genome.  <dig>   lay inside the differentiated block and  <dig>   lay outside. among the  <dig> non-overlapping  <dig> kb windows with the highest frequency of these snps,  <dig> were found within the differentiated block on linkage group  <dig>  the mean number of such snps per window was  <dig>   within the differentiated block and only  <dig>   outside of this region . the elevated fst, along with the abundance of intermediate frequency snps in males that are fixed in females, suggests that this region has limited, if any, recombination between the x and y alleles.

we considered the possibility that this block of differentiation is an artifact of the process by which we selected individuals for sequencing. we initially screened individuals by genotyping two sex-linked microsatellites in order to confirm family identity and sex. we required males to demonstrate a heterogametic pattern and females to demonstrate a homogametic pattern for both markers. five male and five female individuals were excluded by these criteria and may represent naturally sex-reversed individuals. the sharply defined edges of the block lie  <dig>  mb upstream and  <dig>  mb downstream of the microsatellites we genotyped , which would normally represent approximately  <dig> cm of genetic distance in this species
 <cit> . however, there is no evidence of an exponential decay of fst in the flanking regions as would be expected if there was recombination between the markers and the edges of the block. we also considered the possibility that the high level of differentiation might be due to an  <dig>  mb duplication on the y. however, the depth of read coverage is relatively consistent across this entire linkage group. additionally, cytogenetic studies have not revealed any evidence of heteromorphy in this chromosome pair as would arise from a translocation
 <cit> . the sum of the evidence suggests that this block of differentiation most likely reflects an  <dig>  mb inversion on the y-chromosome.

the relatively small size of the putative inversion, and its location in the middle of the chromosome, make it challenging to characterize using standard cytogenetic techniques. ideally, we would characterize the breakpoints, but we were unable to identify anomalous illumina mate pairs near the ends of the inversion in our short insert libraries. longer reads or more widely spaced mate pairs will be needed to characterize the breakpoints of the proposed inversion.

functionally significant snps
we examined the functional consequences of the snps that were fixed in female pools but at intermediate frequency in male pools at the same position using snpeff and snpsift
 <cit> . within the  <dig>  mb differentiated block we found  <dig> stop codon changes ,  <dig> start codon losses  and  <dig> splice site alterations . in the remaining 919 mb of the genome we found a total of  <dig> stop codon changes , no start codon losses, and  <dig> splice site alterations . snps classified as non-synonymous coding changes by snpeff totaled  <dig>  within the differentiated region and  <dig>  across the rest of the genome .table  <dig>

the elevated density of high impact snps within the proposed inversion leads us to believe that deleterious alleles have begun to accumulate on this proto-y. this is in accordance with the canonical model of heterogametic sex-chromosome evolution
 <cit>  and empirical observations of the therian mammal y-chromosome, silene, drosophila and tongue sole
.

localization of the sex-determining gene
previous studies have concluded that sex is multifactorial in o. niloticus
 <cit>  with a major sex-determination gene on lg1
 <cit> . our study confirms this previous work, identifying an xy sex-determination locus in the middle of lg <dig> . the sex-determination gene was first mapped near microsatellite markers gm <dig>  and unh <dig> 
 <cit> . additional aflp and fish mapping found sex-associated markers at  <dig>  mb, near 18 mb and at  <dig>  mb 
 <cit> . another study confirmed gm <dig> and unh <dig> along with several other sex-associated markers spanning a region from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb 
 <cit> . lastly, a rad-seq experiment found the highest associations at  <dig>  mb , but demonstrated a broad region spanning  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb with a lod score above  <dig> 
 <cit> .figure  <dig>

the multifactorial nature of sex-determination in this species causes difficulties for genetic mapping studies. an xx individual may develop as a male due to other genetic factors, or environmental effects on differentiation. these individuals would appear to be recombinant in the sex interval. we previously claimed to exclude wilm’s tumor protein homolog  as the sex-determining gene on the basis of two recombinant individuals
 <cit> , but this conclusion is now in doubt. conversely, the absence of recombination within the proposed inversion may preclude any further fine-mapping of the gene responsible for sex-determination.

differences in gene expression
the block of differentiation on linkage group  <dig> comprises just more than 1% of the assembled genome and contains  <dig> refseq annotated genes. cufflinks predicted  <dig> gene models within the block of differentiation and predicted  <dig>  gene models across the entire transcriptome. of the gene models that showed an fpkm of > <dig>  in at least one sex,  <dig>  gene models  showed higher expression in males, while  <dig>   gene models showed higher expression in females. furthermore, within the inverted region, only  <dig> of these gene models  showed a male bias , while  <dig> of these gene models  showed a female bias . the enrichment of female biased gene models within the proposed inversion is significant . these data suggest that this sex chromosome is at an early-to-intermediate evolutionary phase where the degradation of a proto-y has begun and expression of y-linked genes in males is reduced. however, mechanisms for complete dosage compensation have yet to take hold.

candidate sex determiners
since the proposed inversion limits further attempts to fine-map the sex-determination gene, we evaluated candidate genes based upon putative functional polymorphisms, differential expression and prominence in pathways considered critical to sex-determination in other species. the complete list of candidate genes is presented in table 
 <dig> table  <dig> 
candidate genes in the proposed inversion


sex-determination candidate genes within the proposed inversion with any codon changes and their fpkm values.



first, we analyzed all snps that snpeff classified as high impact mutations . one prominent candidate within the proposed inversion is ras-related protein r-ras <dig> , which is part of the ras-mek-erk pathway within the tgf-β signaling network
 <cit> . alterations to the tgf-β network have been suggested as the mechanism for sex-determination in several fish species
 <cit> . ras <dig> has been implicated as particularly important in the proliferation of cells
 <cit>  and is expressed during early development in a hermaphroditic fish, kryptolebias marmoratus
 <cit> . ras-related protein r-ras <dig> has a stop codon gain in intermediate frequency in males that is absent in females. disruption of r-ras <dig> could lead to decreased cell proliferation of primordial germ cells, resulting in increased likelihood of maleness
 <cit> .

next, we evaluated snps that snpeff categorized as missense mutations . the first of these candidate genes is wilms tumor protein homolog, wt1b , which has been implicated in gonadal development and acts directly upstream of amh, the sex-determination gene in odontesthes hatcheri
 <cit> . wt1b has also been demonstrated to bind to dna and upregulate the sex-determination gene sry in mammals. there is an a237v missense mutation in wt1b that is absent in females and in intermediate frequency in males. although our previous paper rejected wt1b on the basis of two recombinant individuals
 <cit> , in light of the proposed inversion, we now believe that these individuals represented instances of natural sex reversal, not recombination.

a third candidate gene is estrogen-related receptor gamma, errγ . it has a r172h missense mutation within a predicted dna-binding domain
 <cit> . errγ has been shown to be a transcriptional activator of dax- <dig>  and dax- <dig> has been implicated as having an antagonistic effect to sry in mammals
 <cit> . therefore, a mutation in the dna-binding domain of errγ could reduce dax- <dig> transcription and thus have a masculinizing effect.

growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer  <dig>  is another candidate gene  with a missense mutation. the r1775c mutation alters the side chain from a basic side chain to a polar side chain. greb <dig> has been shown to be predominantly expressed within ovaries of young mice
 <cit> . additionally, greb <dig> has been demonstrated to be a coactivator of estrogen receptor-α
 <cit> . therefore, the missense mutation in greb <dig> could downregulate the expression of estrogen receptor-α, resulting in a masculinizing effect on the developing embryo.

another potential sex-determination gene is transcription factor sox- <dig> . there is a t789k missense mutation in intermediate frequency in males that is fixed in females and changes a polar side chain into a basic one. sox- <dig> protein is localized to the same nuclear speckles as sry and it has been suggested that it might play a role in sex-specific splicing in mammals
 <cit> .

we also evaluated gene models showing differential expression between males and females . afg3-like protein  <dig>  has over a nine-fold male-biased expression. it is also on the list of snps with high impact coding alterations with a stop codon gain. however, a clear tie to sex-determination has yet to be elucidated.

suppression of tumorigenicity  <dig> protein  and ras association domain-containing protein  <dig>  were also identified for having over a three-fold male-biased expression pattern. ras association domain family proteins have been implicated as tumor suppressors
. therefore, upregulation of these genes could suppress primordial germ cell proliferation leading to maleness.

lastly, it is possible that there could be y-specific genes that were not captured in our study, because the reference genome that the reads were aligned to is a homozygous clonal xx individual.

CONCLUSIONS
inversions have been well-documented in sex-chromosome evolution and are one possible mechanism for resolving sexually antagonistic selection near the novel sex-determiner through a reduction in recombination
 <cit> . this study revealed an  <dig>  mb block of differentiation between males and females. the variety of evidence presented here is most consistent with the presence of an inversion. the decay of genes and overall level of differentiation indicate that this region has substantially reduced recombination. we have also documented an accumulation of snps causing functional alterations within this region, as would be expected for a genomic region suffering both the deleterious effects of muller’s ratchet and accumulation of deleterious alleles hitchhiking to fixation with advantageous alleles. the transcriptome data indicates that genes inside the proposed inversion show significant enrichment for female-biased expression. these data suggest that o. niloticus has not yet evolved complete dosage compensation. future functional studies are needed to identify the master sex-determination gene within this region. further research on cichlid sex determination will help unravel the underlying sex-determination network that underlies the rapid turnover of sex-determination mechanisms within teleosts.
