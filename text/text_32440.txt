BACKGROUND
sweetpotato  is a hexaploid  dicot and belongs to the family of convolvulaceae. due to its high yielding potential and adaptability under a wide range of environmental conditions, sweetpotato is one of the world's important food crops, especially in developing countries. according to the food and agriculture organization  statistics, world production of sweetpotato in  <dig> was more than  <dig> million tons, and almost 80% came from china, with a production of around  <dig> million tons from about  <dig>  million hectares  <cit> . now sweetpotato is usually used as staple food, animal feed, industrial material and potential raw material for alcohol production. in addition, the high beta carotene content of orange-fleshed sweetpotato plays a crucial role to prevent vitamin a deficiency-related blindness and maternal mortality in many developing countries.

despite its importance, sweetpotato breeding is constrained by the complexity of the genetics of this hexaploid crop and by the lack of genomic resources. molecular markers have great potential to speed up the process of developing improved cultivars. although several sweetpotato genetic maps have been published  <cit> , the existing maps do not have sufficient markers to be highly useful for genetic studies. thus, there is a great need for development of novel markers. with the newly developed high-throughput next generation sequencing technology, a large number of transcribed sequences have been generated for model species as well as economically important non-model plants. in addition to providing an effective approach for gene discovery and transcript profile characterization, these ests can be used as a cost-effective, valuable source for molecular marker development, such as single nucleotide polymorphism  and simple sequence repeats .

dna simple sequence repeats, also known as microsatellites, are tandem repeats of 2- <dig> bp dna core sequences, which are widely distributed in both non-coding and transcribed sequences, commonly known as genomic-ssrs and est-ssrs  <cit> . with the advantages of being pcr-based, reliable, co-dominant, multi-allelic, chromosome specific, and highly informative, ssrs are useful for many applications in plant genetics and breeding such as construction of high-density linkage maps, genetic diversity analysis, cultivar identification, and marker-assisted selection. although genomic ssrs are highly polymorphic and widely distributed throughout the genome  <cit> , and advances in techniques to enrich ssrs have also resulted in the accelerated development of large numbers of genomic ssr markers in many plants  <cit> , it is still expensive, labor-intensive and time-consuming to develop genomic ssr markers. in contrast, est-ssrs can be rapidly developed from est database at lower cost. moreover, due to their association with coding sequences, est-ssrs can also lead to the direct gene tagging for qtl mapping of agronomically important traits and increase the efficiency of marker-assisted selection  <cit> . in addition, est-ssrs show a higher level of transferability to closely related species than genomic ssr markers  <cit>  and can be served as anchor markers for comparative mapping and evolutionary studies  <cit> .

in sweetpotato, the genomic ssrs were originally developed by jarret and bowen  <cit>  and used in inheritance evaluation and mutation mechanisms of microsatellite markers  <cit> , paternity analysis  <cit>  and assessment of genetic diversity and relationship  <cit>  in cultivated sweetpotato and wild species. later, hu et al  <cit>  developed  <dig> primer pairs from small-insert and enriched library,  <dig> of which showed length polymorphism among  <dig> sweetpotato accessions examined. at the same time, they also identified and designed  <dig> primer pairs from a published est database, and  <dig> loci showed length polymorphism among  <dig> sweetpotato genotypes. recently, large amount of ests were generated using pyrosequencing and illumina paired end sequencing and provided the opportunity to develop more useful est-ssrs for sweetpotato  <cit> . in this study, in order to reduce redundancy we combined and reassembled all these available sequences and screened a large scale of ests  with the objectives:  to analyze the frequency and distribution of ssrs in transcribed regions of cultivated sweetpotato genome;  to design new pcr primer pairs from these assembled sequences for sweetpotato;  to validate and evaluate the designed ssr primer pairs in various cultivated sweetpotato genotypes.

RESULTS
frequency and distribution of est-derived ssr markers in sweetpotato
a total of  <dig>  ests with an average length of  <dig> bp were used to evaluate the presence of ssr motifs. in order to eliminate redundant sequences and improve the sequence quality, the tigr gene indices clustering tools   <cit>  was used to obtain consensus sequences from overlapping clusters of ests. assembly criteria included a  <dig> bp minimum match, 95% minimum identity in the overlap region and  <dig> bp maximum unmatched overhangs. in total,  <dig>  potential unique ests including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons were generated. for annotation of these assembled ests, similarity search was conducted against the uniprot database http://www.uniprot.org using blastx algorithm with an e value threshold of 10- <dig>  the results showed that out of  <dig>  ests,  <dig>   showed significant similarity to known proteins and matched  <dig>  unique protein accessions. as shown in table  <dig> using the misa perl script http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/, a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified from  <dig>  unique ests, with an average of one ssr per  <dig>  kb. of these,  <dig> ests contained more than one ssr, and  <dig> were compound ssrs that have more than one repeat type. in order to identify the putative function of genes containing the ssr loci, the  <dig>  est sequences were also searched against uniprot database with e-value cutoff less than 10- <dig>  among of them,  <dig>  had blast hits to known proteins in this uniprot database.

the compilation of all ssrs revealed that the proportion of ssr unit sizes was not evenly distributed. among the  <dig>  ssrs, the tri-and di-nucleotide repeat motifs were the most abundant types , followed by tetra- , penta-  and hexa-nucleotide  repeat motifs . as shown in table  <dig>  ssr length was mostly distributed from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, accounting for  <dig> % of total ssrs, followed by 21- <dig> bp length range . a maximum of  <dig> bp di-nucleotide repeat  was observed. in addition, a total of  <dig> ssr motifs were identified, of which, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeat had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> types, respectively. the ag/ct di-nucleotide repeat was the most abundant motif detected in our est-ssrs , followed by the motif aag/ctt , at/ta , ccg/cgg , aat/att , agt/atc , ac/gt , act/atg , agg/cct  and aac/gtt . the frequency of remaining  <dig> types of motifs accounted for  <dig> % .

primer design and evaluation of est-ssr markers in cultivated sweetpotato
est-ssrs of sweetpotato have been developed previously  <cit> . in order to ensure designing of novel est-ssr primer pairs only, the primers from these published microsatellites were compared against the  <dig>  potential unique ssr-containing sequences. a total of non-repeat  <dig>  ssr motifs were identified in this study. based on these ssr-containing sequences,  <dig>  pairs of high-quality ssr primers were designed using primer premier  <dig>  . of these designed primers,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were for di-, tri-, tetra-, pena-, hexa-nucleotide repeats and compound formation repeats, respectively . after being tested in e shu  <dig> hao and guang 2k- <dig>   <dig> primer pairs  were successfully amplified. the remaining  <dig> primers failed to generate pcr products at various annealing temperatures and mg2+ concentrations and would be excluded from further analysis. of the  <dig> working primer pairs,  <dig> amplified pcr products at the expected sizes, and  <dig> primer pairs resulted in larger pcr products than what expected, and pcr products of the other  <dig> primer pairs were smaller than expected. the  <dig> primers were employed for further validation in eight diverse sweetpotato cultivars, and  <dig> could generate clean and reproducible amplicons in the eight cultivars. examples of pcr products amplified by ssr primer pairs in e shu  <dig> hao and guang 2k- <dig> and in the eight cultivars were shown in figure 3a, b. marker names for the  <dig> primer pairs, along with ssr motif, primer sequences, ssr containing sequences, tm , expected product length are provided in the additional files .

polymorphism of est-derived ssr markers in cultivated sweetpotato
the polymorphism assessment was first examined in e shu  <dig> hao and guang 2k- <dig>  among the  <dig> effective ssr primer pairs,  <dig>  were polymorphic between the two mapping parents. a total of  <dig> alleles at polymorphic loci were detected and the average number of alleles per ssr marker was  <dig>  with a range of 2- <dig>  based on the dominant scoring of the ssr bands characterized by the presence or absence of a particular band . polymorphisms could be observed for  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri-,  <dig> tetra-,  <dig> penta-,  <dig> hexa-nucleotide repeats and  <dig> compound formation repeats . the results of a blastx search showed that  <dig> %  of the polymorphic ssr loci could be associated with known or uncharacterized functional genes.

the polymorphism of the  <dig> est-derived ssrs was further evaluated in eight diverse accessions of cultivated sweetpotatoes. the results showed that  <dig>  primers were polymorphic, with a total of  <dig>  alleles detected . the average number of alleles per locus was  <dig>  with a range of 2- <dig> alleles. a maximum of  <dig> alleles was observed for primer gdaas <dig>  the pic values varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average value of  <dig> . polymorphisms could be observed for  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri-,  <dig> tetra-,  <dig> penta-,  <dig> hexa-nucleotide repeats and  <dig> compound formation repeats . among of these  <dig> polymorphic ssr loci,  <dig> had blast hits to known proteins in the uniprot database.

discussion
frequency and distribution of sweetpotato est-ssrs
the frequency of ssrs in ssr containing ests can accurately reflect the density of ssrs in the transcribed region of the genome. using sanger and next generation sequencing, a large number of est sequences for sweetpotato have been generated. these sequences offered us an opportunity to discover novel genes, also provided a resource to develop markers. however, there is abundant redundancy in these est sequences due to the non-normalized cdna libraries and submission by different researchers. in this study, in order to reduce the redundancy and avoid overestimation of the est-ssr frequency, ssr searching was performed following redundancy elimination. a total of  <dig>  potential unique est sequences  were used for ssr searching and  <dig>  ests  contained ssr motifs, generating  <dig>  unique ssrs. the result of ssr abundance was in agreement with the report by hu et al   <cit> . these two results indicated that the abundance of ssrs for sweetpotato ests was relatively higher than that for other species, e.g. peanut   <cit> , barley , maize , rice , soyghum , wheat   <cit> , medicago truncatula   <cit> , epimudium sagittatum   <cit> . in this work, the frequency of occurrence for est-ssrs was one est-ssr in every  <dig>  kb. in previous reports, an est-ssr occurs every  <dig>  kb in arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig>  kb in rice,  <dig>  kb in maize,  <dig>  kb in soybean,  <dig>  kb in tomato,  <dig>  kb in cotton and  <dig>  kb in poplar  <cit> . however, a direct comparison of abundance estimation and frequency occurrence of ssr in different reports is difficult due to the fact that the estimates were dependent on the ssr search criteria, the size of the dataset, the database-mining tools and the est sequence redundancy.

in earlier reports, tri-nucleotide repeats were generally the most common motif found in both monocots  <cit>  and dicots  <cit> . in the present investigation, tri-nucleotide repeat was also found to be the most abundant ssrs, followed by di-, tetra-, penta, and hexa-nucleotide . as shown in figure  <dig>  the most dominant di- and tri-nucleotide motif types were ag/ct  and aag/ctt , respectively. these were in agreement with recent studies in cultivated peanut   <cit> , epimudium sagittatum  <cit> , and many dicotyledonous species  <cit> . the previous studies of arabidopsis  <cit>  and soybean  <cit>  also suggested that the tri-nucleotide aag motif may be common motif in dicots. in contrast, the most frequent tri-nucleotide repeat motifs were n in wheat, n in rice, and n in maize, barley and sorghum  <cit> . the abundance of the tri-nucleotide ccg repeat motif was favored overwhelmingly in cereal species  <cit>  and also considered as a specific feature of monocot genome, which may be due to the high gc content and consequent codon usage bias  <cit> . but interestingly, in this study, the second most dominant tri-nucleotide repeat motif was ccg/cgg , following aag/ctt. this result was similar to the previous report in sweetpotao  <cit> , which also showed ccg repeat was one of high abundant tri-nucleotide motifs.

validation and polymorphism of sweetpotato est-ssrs
in this study, in order to remove possible duplicate of published est-ssrs of sweetpotato, the primers from the published est-ssr markers were compared against the  <dig>  unique ssr-containing sequences. a total of  <dig> pairs of ssr primers were found matching to ssr-containing sequences of this investigation, and the matched sequences were excluded from primer designing later. among the  <dig> ssr primers, seven pairs of primers designed by wang et al.  <cit>  and seven primer pairs  matched to the same  <dig> ssr-containing sequences . this indicates that the seven ssr primer pairs amplify the same ssr loci as the other seven ssr markers.

based on these non-repeat ssr-containing sequences, a total of  <dig>  primer pairs were designed and used for validation of the est-ssr markers in sweetpotato. of these,  <dig> primer pairs  yielded amplicons in the two parents of our mapping population. this result was similar to est-ssr amplification rate in sweetpotato  <cit>  and many other studies in which a success rate of 60-90% amplification has also been reported  <cit> . in those studies , they also reported a similar success rate of amplification for both genomic ssrs and est-ssrs. however, in sweetpotato, the amplification efficiency of est-ssrs was much higher than that of genomic ssrs  <cit> . the higher efficiency of pcr amplification of est-ssrs may be attributed to the reason that sequence data for primer design were from relatively highly conserved transcribed regions, not randomly from total genomic libraries. just due to the reason that est-ssrs were from highly conserved transcribed regions, they were reported to be less polymorphic, but have higher transferability and better applicability than genomic ssr markers in crop plants  <cit> . the  <dig> amplifiable est-ssr primers will further be used for validation of the amplification and assessment of the polymorphism among wild ipomoea species.

as is commonly known, polymorphic ssr markers are important for research involving genetic diversity, relatedness, evolution, linkage mapping, comparative genomics, and gene-based association studies. in the present investigation, ssr primer polymorphism was first examined in the two parents of our mapping population. among the tested primers,  <dig> were polymorphic between the two mapping parents. these markers would be useful for construction of an ssr-based linkage map. furthermore, among of these working primer pairs,  <dig>  showed polymorphism in the eight cultivated sweetpotatoes. this value was lower than earlier studies, in which  <dig> % and  <dig> % ssrs revealed to be polymorphism in different test set  <cit> . a small number of dna samples and dna samples from a different geographic origin may result in a different polymorphism. for example, a relatively high level of polymorphism was reported in cassava when the number of accessions used increased from  <dig> to over  <dig>  <cit> . additionally, sufficient published data from other plant and animal species have proved that tri-nucleotide ssr loci possess low variability than di-nucleotide containing ssr loci  <cit> . in our results, no correlation was found between the number of nucleotide motif repeats and the level of polymorphism .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, in addition to the characterization of est-derived ssr markers in cultivated sweetpotato, we designed and validated  <dig>  ssr markers in two parents of our mapping population. among the effective primers,  <dig> % of them showed polymorphism in eight sweetpotato cultivars. these developed ssr markers will provide a valuable resource for genetic diversity, evolution, linkage mapping, comparative genomics, gene-based association studies, and marker-assisted selection in sweetpotato genetic study. since these markers were developed based on conserved expressed sequences, they may be valuable for functional analysis of candidate genes. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to exploit est dababase and develop large numbers of ssr markers in sweetpotato.
