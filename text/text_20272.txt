BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori is carried by more than half of the world's adult population  <cit> . it can chronically colonize the human gastric mucosa, where it is found in the mucus layer and is adhered to epithelial cells  <cit> . although most infected subjects remain asymptomatic, infection with h. pylori can promote severe gastritis  <cit>  and significantly increase the risk of gastric malignancies  <cit> . in some epidemiological studies, h. pylori eradication was shown to be effective in gastric cancer prevention  <cit> . additionally, h. pylori eradication was found to decrease the incidence and the severity of lesions with carcinogenic potential in animal models  <cit> . natural mechanisms that protect the host from h. pylori infections depend on the function of the innate defense system in which antibacterial peptides such as cathelicidin ll- <dig>  <cit>  and o-glycans in gastric mucin  <cit>  play a key role.

ll- <dig> is a proteolytically processed peptide derived from the c-terminal domain of human cathelicidin  that is constitutively released to the extracellular space by phagocytic granulocytes and epithelial cells  <cit> . functions ascribed to ll- <dig> include prevention of bacterial growth  <cit> , neutralization of bacterial wall molecule bioactivity  <cit> , and activation of host cells by binding specific cell membrane receptors  <cit> . h. pylori upregulates the production of ll-37/hcap <dig> by the gastric epithelium, suggesting that cathelicidin or its derivative ll- <dig> contributes to determining the balance between host mucosal defense and h. pylori survival mechanisms that govern chronic infection with this gastric pathogen  <cit> .

cationic antibacterial peptides  including ll- <dig> have been extensively investigated as a potential source of new antibacterial molecules. the engineered wlbu <dig> peptide whose residues are arranged to form an amphipathic helical structure with optimal charge and hydrophobic density, overcomes some limitations of natural ll- <dig> such as sensitivity to mg2+ or ca2+ and inactivation by blood serum  <cit> . therefore wlbu <dig> could treat infections where ll- <dig> is ineffective. in order to generate molecules able to mimic caps' ability to compromise bacterial membrane integrity, non-peptide ceragenins with cationic, facially amphiphilic structures characteristic of most antimicrobial peptides were developed. ceragenins such as csa- <dig> reproduce the required cap morphology using a bile-acid scaffolding and appended amine groups  <cit> . they are bactericidal against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including drug-resistant bacteria such as clinically relevant methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , and a previous susceptibility study demonstrated that csa- <dig> has a mic50/mbc <dig> ratio of  <dig>  <cit> . in this study we compare the bactericidal potency of ll- <dig>  wlbu <dig> and csa- <dig> against clinical isolates of h. pylori. the results suggest that cholic acid-based mimics of antimicrobial peptide such as csa- <dig> have potential for treatment of h. pylori infection, including those caused by the clarithromycin and/or metronidazole-resistant strains.

RESULTS
immunohistochemical probing of human gastric mucosa sections with anti-hcap-18/ll- <dig> antibody
microscopic images of mucosal biopsies after immunohistochemical evaluation with anti-hcap-18/ll- <dig> antibody are shown in figure  <dig>  the dab-positive staining indicates the presence of the ll- <dig> peptide and/or its parent protein hcap- <dig>  high intensity dab staining  at the mucus-producing epithelial cells and fundic glands indicates high accumulation of hcap-18/ll- <dig> peptide most likely driven by ll- <dig> specific interaction with mucin, which was reported in previous studies  <cit> . the distribution of hcap-18/ll- <dig> in the more differentiated epithelial cell population of the gastric mucosa differs from that found for human β-defensin  <dig>  <cit>  or lysozyme  <cit>  but is similar to that observed in the colon  <cit> . gastric mucosal biopsies from patients infected with h. pylori show higher intensity of dab staining compared to those obtained from non-infected subjects. according to previous reports, this result indicates a host defense response to h. pylori  <cit> , which is partly based on increased expression of hcap-18/ll- <dig> by gastric epithelial cells.

bactericidal activity of ll- <dig>  wlbu- <dig> peptides and ceragenin csa- <dig> against different strains of h. pylori
to identify resistant strains, clinical isolates of h. pylori were subjected to mic evaluation  with several antibiotics currently used in clinical treatment of h. pylori infection. among seven tested isolates obtained from different subjects, strain  <dig> was resistant to metronidazole and strains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were resistant to both metronidazole and clarithromycin. all isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin and tetracycline. consistent with previous reports on the effects of hbd- <dig>  h-bd- <dig> and ll- <dig> peptides against h. pylori  <cit>  all isolated strains of h. pylori were killed after  <dig> hours incubation with ll- <dig>  wlbu <dig> and csa- <dig> with average mbc  values  <dig>  ±  <dig> ;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  when mbc was evaluated in hepes buffer, or  <dig> ±  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  when mbc was evaluated in brucella broth bullion respectively . evaluation of mbc values in hepes buffer with addition of  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> for h. pylori atcc  <dig> revealed an eight fold increase for ll- <dig>  and a four fold increase for both wlbu <dig> and csa- <dig> .

antibacterial activity of ll- <dig>  wlbu <dig> and csa- <dig> after pre-incubation at low ph with pepsin or mucin
in addition to known inhibition of caps antibacterial activity by divalent cations such as mg2+ and ca2+, the proteolytic activity of pepsin may also compromise caps function in the gastric juice environment with the presence of mucins, and low ph. to address this possibility we evaluated the antibacterial activity against escherichia coli mg <dig> after  <dig> hours pre-incubation of ll- <dig>  wlbu <dig> and csa- <dig> in simulated gastric juice in comparison to activity after their pre-incubation in pbs at ph  <dig> . before conducting the killing assay, the ph of samples with low ph and low ph/pepsin was adjusted to  <dig> . the antibacterial activity of ll- <dig> and wlbu <dig> peptides against e. coli mg <dig> was not significantly changed after pre-incubation at ph ~ <dig> , but was lost after pre-incubation at ph ~ <dig>  in the presence of pepsin . in contrast, the antibacterial activity of csa- <dig> was unchanged by pre-incubation at ph ~ <dig>  with or without pepsin . on the other hand, bactericidal activities of all components were compromised to various extents when tested using a bacterial killing assay in the presence of purified gastric mucin. in close agreement with results obtained from this e. coli mg <dig> study, mbc values of ll- <dig> peptide evaluated after 1h pre-incubation with buffer at low ph containing pepsin or mucin was increased but those of csa- <dig> were nearly unchanged . all evaluated agents lost antibacterial activity in pbs supplemented with 10% human bile . this result suggests that physico-chemical properties of antibacterial molecules promote their insertion in bile lipoprotein, thereby limiting their interaction with the bacterial wall. there has been no study to evaluate antibacterial activity of caps in duodenal juice, but these results indicate that bile reflux into the stomach may interfere with caps activity.

analytical characterization of ll- <dig> and csa- <dig> after incubation with pepsin
mass spectrometry analysis  reveals that three hours incubation with pepsin results in extensive degradation of ll- <dig>  however, at low ph, pepsin digestion is highly specific and ll- <dig> peptide cleavage is limited to the site with hydrophobic amino acids. potential cleavage sites predicted by peptidecutter characterization software http://kr.expasy.org/tools/peptidecutter/, suggest that ll- <dig> digestion with pepsin in our experimental conditions should release  <dig> products, including  <dig> shorter peptides . these predictions are consistent with mass spectral analysis, which does not show the presence of any intact ll- <dig> remaining following incubation with pepsin at low ph, but does reveal the emergence of multiple new peaks with different retention times. the remaining antibacterial activity of ll- <dig> following treatment with pepsin  in the killing assays likely represents the residual activity of these ll- <dig> fragments. contrary to the observed degradation of ll- <dig>  csa- <dig> analytical characterization was not changed after incubation with pepsin at low ph.

toxicity of ll- <dig>  wlbu <dig> and csa- <dig> against rbc and human adenocarcinoma cells
non-specific insertion of antibacterial peptides and their mimics into host cell membranes can cause toxicity. host cell membrane permeabilization can be measured by the release of proteins such as hemoglobin and ldh from the cytosol to the extracellular space. by evaluating hemoglobin and ldh release , we show no significant membrane permeabilization by any tested molecules in the range at which they have bactericidal activity in saline buffers . this finding was confirmed by microscopic evaluation of adenocarcinoma cell morphology showing no visible difference between the control cells and those treated with  <dig> μg/ml ll- <dig>  wlbu <dig> or csa- <dig> . however an increase in hemoglobin and ldh release was observed with increasing concentration. among the three molecules tested, wlbu <dig> was the strongest hemolytic agent, but all of them showed similar ability to compromise adenocarcinoma cell membrane integrity . csa- <dig> bactericidal concentrations against h. pylori and e. coli mg <dig>  evaluated in saline as well as nutrient containing buffer were below its minimal hemolytic concentration and below concentrations causing dysfunction of adenocarcinoma cell membranes.

discussion
the rate of successful treatment of h. pylori stomach infection, achieved with combination therapies of two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor has declined from over 90% to about 80% during the past decade  <cit> . in addition, the cost of this therapy is significant, and therefore a need for more widely available means of treating or preventing h. pylori infection still exists  <cit> . new agents to treat h. pylori infections are necessary also due to increasing drug-resistance problems caused by extensive use of antibiotics  <cit>  and the adaptive survival mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria to counteract currently used antimicrobials. for example, h. pylori strains resistant to amoxicillin, metronidazole and clarithromycin have been reported  <cit> . methods to improve treatments for h. pylori might be guided by insight into the natural mechanisms by which infected patients respond to this bacterium and the reasons why the normal host-defense mechanisms fail.

this study confirms a previous report of increased hcap-18/ll- <dig> expression in gastric mucosa of subjects infected with h. pylori  <cit> . this finding suggests that increasing production of the bactericidal peptide ll- <dig> may play a key role in host defense against h. pylori  <cit> . however, this bactericidal response in some subjects is insufficient and h. pylori infection can still reach a chronic stage. the lack of bactericidal function of ll- <dig> in this setting has suggested that increased expression of hcap-18/ll- <dig> peptide in gastric mucus of infected subjects may have additional functions as an anti-inflammatory and growth stimulating agent. indeed, it was recently shown that gastric ulcer healing in rats is promoted by cathelicidin-mediated transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptors  via the transforming growth factor alpha  signaling pathway  <cit> . alternatively, loss of defense against h. pylori may be due to loss of antibacterial function of ll- <dig> in the milieu of the gastric mucosa. consequently, design of antimicrobial agents that are more effective in this setting can be beneficial.

motivated by immunohistological results, the activity of ll- <dig> against clinical isolates of h. pylori and e. coli mg <dig> under biologically relevant conditions was compared with that of the synthetic peptide wlbu <dig> and the ceragenin csa- <dig>  this study shows that csa- <dig>  contrary to ll- <dig> and wlbu <dig> peptides, maintains strong bactericidal activity in the presence of mucin and after preincubation with pepsin at low ph. these conditions represent unique challenges related to h. pylori treatment, as these bacteria in the stomach are protected from the acidic environment by a thick mucus layer and the effectiveness of many antimicrobial drugs is greatly diminished at acidic ph  <cit> . accordingly, the first effective therapy for h. pylori infection was a combination of relatively ph-insensitive antimicrobial drugs such as bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole  <cit> . in addition, as the stomach periodically empties its contents  the finding that csa- <dig> has bactericidal activity at much lower concentration then ll- <dig>  after the same incubation time   <cit> , suggests that csa- <dig> may have therapeutic potential for treatment of h. pylori infection. the antibacterial activity of csa- <dig>  which has a smaller net charge and a unique distribution of this charge over a steroid scaffold when compared with ll- <dig> and wlbu <dig> peptides, was also found to be less inhibited by mucin isolated from gastric mucosa. therapeutic potential based on the ability of csa- <dig> to eradicate h. pylori is also supported by previously reported antibacterial activity against other bacteria strains, including clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  and s. aureus  <cit> . csa-13's unique ability to compromise bacterial membrane integrity and the chemical nature of this low-molecular-mass compound that translates to lower cost of synthesis compared to cationic antibacterial peptides suggest that csa- <dig> or perhaps other ceragenins have potential for treatment of h. pylori infection, including those caused by its resistant strains.

CONCLUSIONS
bactericidal activity of ceragenin csa- <dig> is maintained after preincubation in simulated gastric juice and in the presence of mucin. this in vitro evaluation indicates a significant potential of this molecule in treatment of stomach mucosal infection.
