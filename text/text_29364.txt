BACKGROUND
post-embryonic development in plants depends on the establishment of stem cell niches in shoot and root meristems that take place during embryogenesis. pattern formation in the embryo is under the control of co-ordinated spatially and temporally regulated gene expression, cell division, and hormone function. most of our knowledge about the regulation of pattern formation during embryo development is based on studies of embryo-defective mutants in the angiosperm model plant arabidopsis   <cit> . by contrast, our knowledge about the regulation of embryo development in gymnosperms is limited. molecular data suggest that extant seed plants  shared a final common ancestor about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . therefore, characterization of the expression and functions of genes regulating embryo development in gymnosperms is interesting from an evolutionary point of view. another reason to study gymnosperms, and especially conifers, is that they are of great commercial importance.

embryo development in pinus can be divided into three phases  <cit> :  proembryogeny – all stages before elongation of the suspensor,  early embryogeny – all stages during and after elongation of the suspensor and before establishment of the root meristem,  late embryogeny – establishment of the root and shoot meristem and further development of the embryo. proembryogeny starts with a free nuclear stage. the zygote undergoes several rounds of nuclear duplication that are not followed by cytokinesis. after cell wall formation, four tiers are formed of which the lowest tier will form the embryonal mass and the second lowest tier will elongate to form the embryonal suspensor. in most pinus species the four apical cells and the suspensor network in the proembryo separate into four filamentous embryos  <cit> . this process is termed cleavage polyembryony  <cit> . the four embryos, which arise from the separated tiers, begin their development by apical cell growth  <cit> . the basal cells of the embryonal mass divide anticlinally and elongate, contributing to the suspensor, which consists of several files of terminally differentiated non-dividing cells. early embryogeny begins with the elongation of the suspensor. the enlarging suspensor pushes the embryo out of its archegonial jacket into the rich nutritive reserves of the megagametophyte. in an ovule where polyembryony is present, the competition between genetically identical embryos offers no selective advantage; instead it has been suggested that the embryo with the best physiological constitution situated in the most suitable environment becomes the dominant embryo, which usually develops to maturity  <cit> . the rest of the embryos, the subordinate embryos, are degraded by programmed cell death   <cit> . during late embryogeny the root and shoot apical meristems are delineated and the plant axis established. the maturing embryo is characterized by the initiation of cotyledons.

various approaches have been taken for elucidating the regulation of embryo development in plants. the most comprehensive study of transcript profiling in a conifer was conducted in loblolly pine  where approximately  <dig>  ests were regenerated from zygotic and somatic embryos  <cit> . based on  <dig> genes, essential for embryogenesis in arabidopsis, 85% had very strong sequence similarity to an est in the loblolly pine database  <cit> . stress-related processes and auxin-mediated-processes were, by using microarray analysis, identified to be associated with early somatic embryo development in norway spruce  <cit> . microarray analysis has also been performed for studying global gene expression during development of dominant zygotic embryos of maritime pine   <cit> . the results revealed that epigenetic regulation and transcriptional control related to auxin transport and response are critical during early to mid-stages of pine embryogenesis, and that important events during embryogenesis seem to be coordinated by putative orthologs of major developmental regulators in angiosperms. recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies enable global transcriptome profiling without prior sequence knowledge  <cit> . by analysing the transcription network between embryo and endosperm during early seed development in maize  it was shown that many metabolic activities are specific for the embryo or the endosperm, and that transcription factors and imprinting genes are specifically expressed in the embryo or the endosperm  <cit> . comparative transcriptome analysis of somatic and zygotic embryos in cotton  uncovered that the process of somatic embryogenesis is characterized by induction of several stress-related genes  <cit> . whole transcriptome profiling during initiation of embryogenic tissue in maize showed an increased expression of stress factors and the importance of a coordinated expression of somatic embryogenesis-related genes  <cit> , as well as the involvement of a complex auxin-signalling pathway  <cit> . several metabolic events were detected by transcriptome analysis in proliferating embryogenic cultures of japanese larch   <cit> .

to improve the understanding of genomic factors involved in early embryo development in scots pine we performed a genome-wide high-throughput transcriptome sequencing for early stages during zygotic embryogenesis. the expression of twenty-three differentially expressed genes was confirmed by qrt-pcr analyses. based on these analyses, and on the assumption that the scots pine genes are homologous to their arabidopsis counterparts, we have identified transcripts and putative processes that take place during early embryo development including initiation of cleavage polyembryogeny and development of dominant embryos. to our knowledge, this represents the first genome-wide transcript expression profiling of the earliest stages during embryo development in a pinus species.

methods
plant material
immature cones were collected for sequencing during summer  <dig>  from an open-pollinated seed orchard clone  of scots pine  in hade, central sweden . the swedish forestry research institute, that is running the seed orchard, had given us permission to collect cones. the same clone has been used for sequencing the scots pine genome . in order to collect the desired developmental stages of zygotic embryos and megagametophytes, cones were harvested periodically between the 11th and 20th of july. the zygotic embryos were excised from the megagametophytes under a stereomicroscope. both the embryos  and the megagametophytes  were sorted and collected, in eppendorf tubes placed on ice, according to developmental stage : stage  <dig>  the ovules contained a single embryo at the stage before cleavage ; stage  <dig>  the ovules contained an embryo at the stage of cleavage ; stage  <dig>  the ovules contained a dominant embryo, do, and subordinate embryos, su ; stage  <dig>  the ovule contained a dominant embryo just before cotyledon differentiation . after a maximum of 10 min on ice, the eppendorf tubes with collected embryos or megagametophytes were frozen in liquid nitrogen. each sample included from  <dig> to  <dig> embryos, depending on the developmental stage. equivalent materials were collected for qrt-pcr analyses during summer  <dig>  to avoid specificity of the embryogenesis process in a particular region, the new samples were collected from a tree of scots pine growing at the slu estate located in ultuna, central sweden , from which an unlimited number of cones could be collected. the harvesting of cones was performed periodically between the 17th of june and 8th of july.fig.  <dig> early stages during development of zygotic embryos in scots pine that have been included in this study. a a single zygote-derived early embryo . b the single embryo at stage e <dig> has cleaved to form multiple embryos of equal size . c one embryo has become dominant  and subordinate embryos  successively stop developing. d a well-developed dominant embryo before cotyledon differentiation . bars  <dig>  mm




rna extraction and cdna synthesis
total rna from zygotic embryos was extracted using the rnaqueous-micro rna isolation kit , followed by a dnase i treatment to remove any residual genomic dna, according to manufacturer’s instructions. rna from megagametophytes was isolated using the spectrum plant total rna kit , including the on-column dnase i digestion step for removing traces of genomic dna.

the concentration of the isolated rna from samples collected for rna sequencing  was determined fluorometrically using a qubit fluorometer , and the integrity was verified by an agilent bioanalyzer using the rna  <dig> nano chip . the rna samples with an rna integrity number  higher than  <dig> were used for cdna synthesis and amplification with the mint- <dig> cdna synthesis kit . briefly, first-strand synthesis was initiated from 1 μg of total rna by a mint rt using a modified poly-dt primer. second strand synthesis was carried out by the encyclo dna polymerase , followed by pcr amplification. the number of cycles  for double-strand cdna  amplification was estimated for each sample. amplified cdna was then purified with the nucleospin gel and pcr clean-up kit . finally, a reamplification step was performed with specific primers for  <dig> pyrosequencing. in total, nine different dsdna enriched libraries were constructed, five from zygotic embryos at stage e <dig>  e <dig>  e3do, e3su and e <dig>  and four from megagametophytes at stage m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> 

rna isolated from embryos collected for qrt-pcr  was quantified using a nanodrop- <dig> spectrophotometer . cdna synthesis from 100 ng of total rna was performed using the quantitect whole transcriptome  followed by 8 h amplification according to the manufacturer’s protocol for high-yield reactions.

transcriptome sequencing
transcriptome sequencing was performed at the university of malaga ultrasequencing facility using the gs-flx + platform with a gs-flx titanium kit, roche applied sciences  following the protocol described by canas et al.  <cit> .

transcript reconstruction from rna-seq
before assembly, the  <dig>  million raw  <dig> reads were quality checked, and short reads  and adapter sequences were removed from the dataset using seqclean . after cleaning the reads were de novo assembled using the newbler software  which resulted in  <dig>  isogroups containing  <dig>  isotigs . in order to get an even more comprehensive transcriptome dataset, we then also incorporated publically available datasets with the previously obtained assembly. we integrated another  <dig>  puts from plantgdb   <cit>  and a set of  <dig> ests from the ncbi estdb, which were used as a reference to map reads against . the various datasets were integrated using the cd-hit software  <cit>  in order to remove redundant transcripts and clustering into isogroups. for each isogroup only the longest isotig was retained for further analysis. this resulted in a final transcriptome set of  <dig>  transcripts . the lengths of the assembled transcripts are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

note: puts and cl/ <dig> transcripts that were not present in the seed transcriptome did not receive any reads, so their rpkm was  <dig> for all the stages and were then removed from the differential expression analysis.

for expression quantification of each sample, all cleaned reads were mapped back to the integrated transcript set using bwa  <cit> . afterwards the mapping results were processed with samtools  <cit>  to obtain read counts, which were then processed with an in-house perl script to result in rpkm values for each transcript.

open reading frame  predictions on the total  <dig>  transcripts were obtained by applying transdecoder with default parameters except for the coding model, which was specific for p. sylvestris, built from manually curated full length transcripts. transdecoder identified  <dig>  orfs in the dataset.

functional annotation and enrichment analysis
in order to functionally characterise the resulting orfs, a blastp analysis  was performed against the arabidopsis tair <dig> database. all orfs were also analysed for protein domains with interproscan   <cit>  and possible go-terms were determined based on the interpro domains. to identify putative transcription factors  in our dataset all orfs were screened against the plant transcription factor database, planttfdb v <dig>   <cit>  using blastp .

gene annotation analyses and functional enrichment of differentially expressed transcripts in embryos and megagametophytes were performed with wego  tool  <cit>  and agrigo analysis toolkit  <cit>  respectively. for functional enrichment analyses the seed annotated transcriptome was used as background/reference genome. hypergeometric test was used as statistical method with an adjusted fdr value  and complete go was selected as gene ontology type in the settings.

identification of differentially expressed transcripts
for identification of differentially expressed transcripts , pairwise comparisons were performed between:  embryos and megagametophytes at the same developmental stage ,  embryos at consecutive developmental stages  and  megagametophytes at consecutive developmental stages . the relative fold-change  is presented as log <dig> of the rpkm ratio . transcripts with a fc higher than  <dig> were considered as differentially expressed transcripts . when the rpkm value of one sample was  <dig>  the fold-change could not be estimated. in these cases  <dig> and - <dig> values were assigned as relative fold-changes. in addition, when the rpkm value was  <dig> in one of the samples and lower than  <dig> in the other, the transcript was excluded from differential expression analyses.

venn diagrams have been drawn with the online web tool available at http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/venn/.

k-means cluster analysis was performed with a subset of dets  detected in any of the pairwise comparisons between different developmental stages in embryos and in megagametophytes. initially, the relative expression value for each det was calculated by normalizing all the rpkm values from different developmental stages to its maximum rpkm value. the optimal number of clusters was estimated separately for the embryo and megagametophyte data and normalized values were clustered using the kmeans function in r software.

quantitative rt-pcr
quantitative rt-pcr was performed in a bio-rad cfx connect™ real-time pcr detection system cycler . all samples were run in duplicate starting from 5 ng of cdna from four biological replicates for each developmental stage. elongation factor  <dig>  and phosphoglucomutase  were used as reference genes  <cit> . relative quantitative analyses were performed following the 2-ΔΔct livak method. only transcripts showing a similar expression profile in at least three out of four biological replicates have been included. the primer sequences for the transcripts tested are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  significant differences in transcript accumulation between different developmental stages were estimated by a t-test mean comparison analysis  using the jmp software .

to validate the rna-seq data, the same rna that was used for sequencing was tested by qrt-pcr. new cdna from embryos was synthesized and amplified using the quantitect whole transcriptome kit , as has been explained above. cdna from megagametophytes was synthesized by using the primescript™ rt reagent kit , according to manufacturer’s instructions. the pearson correlation coefficient between the expression profiles obtained by rna-seq and qrt-pcr was calculated for each of the  <dig> candidate transcripts in embryos and for  <dig> selected dets  in megagametophytes . the correlation coefficient was estimated by using the pearson statistical function in microsoft excel.

RESULTS
overview of the transcriptome in seeds
to identify transcripts and biological processes involved in early zygotic embryogenesis in scots pine, rna was isolated from embryos and megagametophytes representing four developmental stages . nine rna-seq libraries were sequenced by using  <dig> roche sequencing technology. a total of  <dig>  million raw reads was generated, resulting in  <dig>  transcripts varying in length from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and with a mean length of 1242 bp .

in total,  <dig>  transcripts containing orfs were identified in the seed transcriptome, of which  <dig>  transcripts  had significant alignments to the arabidopsis thaliana tair <dig> database and  <dig> transcripts  with the plant transcription factor database .  <dig>  transcripts  had annotated go terms into at least one of the three main categories:  <dig>  transcripts  displayed one or more ontologies related to biological process,  <dig>   to molecular function and  <dig>   to cell component.table  <dig> summary of rna-seq seed transcriptome data




transcript expression values were calculated as rpkm, resulting in  <dig>  assembled transcripts with detectable expression signals , in at least one of the developmental stage .  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts were detected in embryos and megagametophytes, respectively. most of the transcripts  were detected in both tissues, however the number of unique transcripts was threefold higher in embryos than in megagametophytes . the number of identified transcription factors  was also higher in embryos .fig.  <dig> venn diagram demonstrating the total number of transcripts and tfs detected in embryos and megagametophytes. numbers in the intersection represent transcripts/tfs detected both in embryos and megagametophytes. a all detected transcripts  in the seed transcriptome. b number of tfs  detected in the seed transcriptome




the total number of transcripts detected at each developmental stage during seed development increased in embryos, but decreased in megagametophytes . around  <dig>  transcripts were expressed at all developmental stages both in embryos and in megagametophytes. the number of unique transcripts detected at specific developmental stages was fairly constant in the embryos, but decreased in the megagametophytes during seed development from  <dig>  transcripts at stage m <dig> to  <dig> transcripts at stage m <dig> . out of  <dig> tfs identified during early embryo development,  <dig> tfs  were detected at all developmental stages, and about  <dig> tfs were only detected at one developmental stage . in megagametophytes,  <dig> tfs  were detected at all developmental stages, however, the number of tfs detected at only one developmental stage decreased during seed development .table  <dig> number of transcripts and tfs detected in embryos and megagametophytes at different developmental stages 




to test the reliability of the rna-seq results,  <dig> transcripts  were selected for examination by qrt-pcr. the pearson correlation coefficient between the expression profiles obtained by rna-seq and qrt-pcr was calculated from each transcript separately . the correlation coefficient obtained was similar for most transcripts, except for a few transcripts at some time points.

changes in transcript accumulation during seed development
differentially expressed transcripts in pairwise comparisons between embryos and megagametophytes during seed development
to identify differentially expressed transcripts  we performed pairwise comparisons between embryos and megagametophytes at the same developmental stage. in total  <dig>  transcripts were up-regulated with a fold change higher than  <dig>  in at least one of the pairwise comparisons between embryos and megagametophytes .  <dig>  transcripts were up-regulated in embryos and  <dig> in megagametophytes. the greatest difference in the number of up-regulated transcripts between embryos and megagametophytes was observed at developmental stage  <dig> .

about 54% of the dets up-regulated in embryos and 58% of the dets up-regulated in megagametophytes could be go annotated . cellular and metabolic processes were the most dominant groups in the biological process category both in embryos and megagametophytes . furthermore, transcripts assigned to response to stimulus were over-represented in megagametophytes. in both embryos and megagametophytes, enriched go terms in the molecular function category included catalytic and binding activities, and in the cell component category the subcategories cell and cell part were the most abundant.fig.  <dig> go annotation analysis of differentially expressed transcripts  in embryos and megagametophytes. the analysis included the total number of dets with a fold-change greater than  <dig>  in any of the pairwise comparisons between embryos and megagametophytes. presented data show the percentage of transcripts related to the total number of transcripts used as input in each go subcategory  in embryos  and in megagametophytes , using the wego  tool




by increasing the go annotation level, it was found that transcripts up-regulated in embryos were enriched for diverse biological processes such as cellular component biogenesis and cellular and metabolic processes related to chromosome organization, dna packaging, translation and gene expression . in the megagametophytes the up-regulated transcripts were highly enriched in response to stimulus, such as response to stress and to chemical and endogenous stimulus, including response to abscisic acid  . in the molecular function category, assignments in the embryos were mainly related to dna binding and structural constituent of ribosome. both activities are highly related to gene expression and protein synthesis. in the megagametophytes, transcripts functioning in nutrient reservoir activity were highly over-represented . transcripts identified in embryos for the cell component category showed enrichment for nucleus, ribosome and protein-dna complex  and transcripts in megagametophytes were enriched mainly in protein body component . as expected, transcripts up-regulated in embryos showed go enrichment for different cellular processes and functions in dna-packaging, translation and gene expression. these processes are important during active cell proliferation  <cit> . transcripts up-regulated in megagametophytes were enriched for accumulation of storage material and response to chemical and endogenous stimuli. this might indicate that the megagametophyte, in a similar way as the endosperm, can sense environmental signals and induce the corresponding signalling pathways for regulating embryo development  <cit> .fig.  <dig> summary of gene ontology  enrichment analysis for differentially expressed transcripts during early seed development. the analysis included dets with a fold change greater than  <dig>  identified in any of the pairwise comparisons between embryos and megagametophytes. the most abundant classes in each category, biological process, molecular function and cell component are shown for a embryos and b megagametophytes. level of enrichment is proportional to color intensity. fdr values are presented in parenthesis. detailed information is shown in additional file 3: figures s <dig> and s3




we carried out pairwise comparisons between the group of transcripts showing the highest differences in abundance between embryos and megagametophytes at each developmental stage . transcripts related to members of the arabidopsis cytochrome p <dig> gene family  showed, at all developmental stages, high accumulation in embryos but low or no accumulation  in megagametophytes. up-regulated transcripts in megagametophytes were mainly related to the arabidopsis 12s seed storage protein family , also known as cruciferins. these proteins are involved in nutrient reservoir activity and are the major sources of nitrogen and carbon during early seed germination  <cit> . the rpkm values of cruciferin-related transcripts were similar at all developmental stages. the majority of the transcripts up-regulated in the megagametophytes had no hits against the tair database .

at stage e <dig>  e <dig> and e3do, transcripts related to genes encoding for cell wall modifications  were detected. specifically at stage e <dig>  a putative homolog to somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase <dig> , as well as transcripts related to genes involved in response to auxin and other hormones such as indole-3acetate o-methyltransferase  <dig> , skp1-like protein 1a , gamma-vacuolar-processing enzyme , gibberellin-regulated protein  <dig>  and glutathione s-transferase u <dig>  were highly abundant . transcripts related to nucleosome assembly  were detected at all developmental stages except at stage e <dig>  other transcripts up-regulated from stage  <dig> onwards coded for proteins related to stress responses i.e. non-specific lipid-transfer protein  <dig> , sugar transport protein  <dig>  or abscisic acid insensitive  <dig> . transcripts up-regulated at stage e <dig> included transcripts related to cell signalling, negative regulation of cell division and cell wall loosening, as well as transcripts related to development such as protein ralf-like  <dig> , fama, plantacyanin  or pectin acetylesterase  .

in total  <dig> tfs were detected during early seed development . out of these tfs,  <dig> were differentially expressed with a fold change higher than two between embryos and megagametophytes . the differentially expressed tfs belonged to  <dig> families, of which the bhlh, far <dig>  traf and nac families were the largest . in general, the number of tfs belonging to each family was higher in embryos than in megagametophytes. interestingly, some of the tf families were enriched differently in embryos and megagametophytes during seed development e.g. for bhlh, c3h, nac, ap2-erebp and traf . in addition, sixteen tf families were detected only in embryos and four tf families were detected only in megagametophytes. in general, several tfs belonging to families specifically expressed in embryos were involved in plant growth and development, while tf families detected only in megagametophytes were related to responses to stress and other stimuli .

differentially expressed transcripts during embryo development
in total,  <dig>  dets with a fold change higher than two were identified in the pairwise comparisons between embryos at different developmental stages . when including only transcripts with a rpkm >  <dig>   <dig> dets were detected. to provide an overview of the expression patterns of these dets during embryo development, k-means clustering analysis was performed . four types of expression profiles were detected, where type i and ii included four clusters each and type iii and iv include two clusters . the accumulation of transcripts belonging to type i increased throughout the course of embryo development. transcripts in cluster  <dig> and  <dig> were specifically enriched for processes related to response to abiotic stress, and transcripts in cluster  <dig> and  <dig> were highly enriched for nutrient reservoir activity , response to aba and other hormones. the expression of type ii transcripts decreased during embryo development. however, the accumulation pattern differed among the four clusters. transcripts in cluster  <dig> and  <dig> were abundant for cell wall modification, toxin and carbohydrate metabolic processes, while cluster  <dig> included a higher number of transcripts with a function in structural constituents of ribosomes. type iii transcripts showed high accumulation at only one intermediate developmental stage . transcripts within cluster  <dig>  mainly accumulated at stage e <dig>  were highly enriched for nutrient reservoir activity. however, no significant go enrichment was obtained for cluster  <dig>  the expression level of type iv transcripts was either high or low at both e <dig> and e3do stages. cluster  <dig> included transcripts involved in dna packaging and protein-dna complex assembly. together the go enrichment analyses of the clusters showed that the abundance of transcripts related to stress response and nutrient activity increased during embryo development, while the abundance of transcripts related to cell wall modification decreased.fig.  <dig> clustering of differentially expressed transcripts identified in the pairwise comparisons between embryo developmental stages. the analysis included dets with a fc >  <dig> and rpkm >  <dig>  for each transcript, rpkm values were normalized to its maximum rpkm value during embryo development. normalized values were subjected to k-means clustering method and classified into  <dig> different clusters, based on their expression level across the four developmental stages. the y-and x-axis represent relative expression  and different embryo developmental stages, respectively. enriched processes and functions and their enrichment level  are presented for each cluster. the level of enrichment is proportional to colour intensity




when comparing embryos at consecutive developmental stages, including subordinate embryos,  <dig> dets were detected. the highest number of dets  was detected in the comparison between embryos at stage e <dig> and e <dig>  and 80%  of these dets were only detected in this pairwise comparison . dets highly accumulated at stage e <dig>  were enriched for biological processes related to cell wall loosening, organization and modification, with a beta-expansin -related transcript having the highest fold-change . furthermore,  <dig> tfs involved in several developmental processes were detected, out of which transcripts related to lob domain-containing protein  <dig>  and serk <dig>  as well as some members belonging to the homeobox-leucine zipper protein family , showed a high fold-change . transcripts that were over-represented in e <dig> were enriched for processes related to response to aba, hormone stimulus, nucleosome organization and nutrient reservoir activity . these dets included  <dig> tfs that were go annotated for developmental processes .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts  between consecutive stages during embryo development. the analysis included dets with fc >  <dig> and rpkm >  <dig> identified in any of the four pairwise comparisons. a histogram showing the number of up-regulated  and down-regulated  dets between consecutive developmental stages. b venn diagram showing the number of common and specific dets between consecutive pairwise comparisons




close to  <dig> dets were identified when comparing embryos at stage e <dig> and e3do . transcripts assigned to response to aba and hormone stimulus showed higher accumulation at stage e <dig>  and those involved in response to abiotic stress were enriched at stage e3do . when comparing dominant embryos at stage e3do and stage e <dig>   <dig> dets were detected . transcripts up-regulated in e3do embryos were mainly related to axis specification processes, while transcripts up-regulated at stage e <dig> were involved in processes related to response to hormone stimulus and lipid transport  . tfs, differentially expressed in embryos at stage e3do and e <dig>  which were annotated to developmental processes, included transcripts related to auxin responsive factor  <dig> , leunig , wuschel-related homeobox , cyp78a <dig> and arabidopsis nac domain containing protein  <dig>  .

by comparing dominant and subordinate embryos at stage e <dig>  it was possible to detect  <dig> dets . many of the transcripts up-regulated in dominant embryos were related to carbohydrate metabolic processes and axis specification processes . dets enriched in subordinate embryos were involved in response to water stress  and lipid transport. nac and hb were the largest tf families in dominant embryos, while in subordinates myb-related factors were the most abundant .

a schematic summary of the results obtained from the pairwise comparisons between consecutive stages during embryo development is presented in fig.  <dig>  together our results show that processes involved in cell-wall modifications, hormone signalling, axis specification and stress-induced responses are activated during early embryo development. a strict regulation of cell division, elongation and adhesion is critical during embryonic patterning formation. auxin is perhaps the most pervasive signalling molecule in plants and has been implicated in many developmental processes including embryogenesis in both angiosperms and conifers . in several studies it has been shown that genes related to stress are over-represented during early embryo development  <cit> . furthermore, many of the differentially expressed tfs that belong to the largest families  are related to cellular and developmental processes, hormone signalling and stress responses .fig.  <dig> schematic summary of the results obtained from the pairwise comparisons between consecutive stages during embryo development .  number of dets detected;  go enriched biological processes;  number of tfs identified




differentially expressed transcripts between different developmental stages in megagametophytes
dets identified in the pairwise comparisons between megagametophytes at consecutive developmental stages were also subjected to k-means clustering, resulting in  <dig> different clusters grouped into five types of expression profiles . no significant go enrichment processes or functions  were assigned to any of the clusters. the accumulation of type i transcripts increased from stage m <dig> to stage m <dig>  transcripts related to response to stimulus and regulation of biological process were the most abundant. the expression of type ii transcripts decreased from stage m <dig> to stage m <dig>  type ii clusters were abundant in transcripts with go terms associated with cell wall organization, and reproductive and developmental processes. type iii transcripts accumulated either at stage m <dig> or stage m <dig>  go terms assigned to clusters in type iii were mainly related to response to stimulus. type iv and v included only one small cluster each. cluster  <dig>  with transcripts accumulating both at stages m <dig> and m <dig>  presented a high percentage of dets responding to stimulus, while transcripts from cluster  <dig> were annotated only for metabolic and cellular processes.

a total of  <dig> dets  were detected in the pairwise comparisons between megagametophytes at consecutive developmental stages. no significant enriched processes or functions were found in any of the pairwise comparisons. similar to embryos, the highest number of dets was detected during the transition from stage m <dig> to m <dig>  and 85% of the dets were specifically detected in this pairwise comparison . the number of transcripts annotated for developmental processes decreased from  <dig> at stage m <dig> to  <dig> at stage m <dig>  meanwhile, the number of dets with go terms associated with response to stress and stimulus remained more constant . in addition, transcripts encoding for proteins belonging to the small heat shock protein  family, known for its role in stress response, showed similar accumulation during all developmental stages .

ten dets with assigned go terms related to development were specifically detected at stage m <dig>  in which putative homologs to expansins  and agamous-like mads-box  were included. agl <dig> was not detected in embryos at any developmental stage. in accordance, agl <dig> was expressed in the endosperm but not embryos of brachypodium distachyon . several transcripts related to metal ion transport, e.g. copper transporter  <dig>  and zinc transporter  <dig> , were detected at stage m <dig> . zip transporters participating in ion translocation during embryo and endosperm development have been detected in maize seeds  <cit> . at stage m <dig>  a transcript related to atep <dig>  encoding for an endochitinase, was highly abundant . a homologous gene, chia4-pa <dig>  has been shown to be expressed in the single cell-layered zone surrounding the corrosion cavity in the megagametophyte in norway spruce seeds  <cit> .

expression of selected transcripts during early embryo development
the transcript levels of selected dets were tested by qrt-pcr in four biological replicates. the selection was based on the estimated expression  obtained from the transcriptome data and functional annotations of homologous genes in other species, mainly arabidopsis, that have been related to embryo development. gene sequence information in conifers is limited, thus for convenience, we refer each conifer transcript to the arabidopsis gene that it shares most sequence similarity to. we have taken this approach for making it possible to get a general idea about which processes might be important during early embryo development. the results generated from qrt-pcr analysis are presented in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> quantitative real-time -pcr analysis of the relative transcript level of selected genes during early embryo development. relative expression levels, estimated by the livak method , are referred to the developmental stage showing the minimum accumulation for each transcript. expression values are normalized against two reference genes elongation factor- <dig>  and phoshoglucomutase . transcript levels are means ± sd of three or four biological replicates, with two technical replicates each. different letters indicate significant differences in the relative expression level 




transcripts related to endo-beta-mannase  <dig> , transparent testa <dig> , expb <dig>  serk <dig>  ltp <dig>  and hap3a were highly abundant at stage e <dig> and decreased significantly at stage e <dig> 

in arabidopsis seeds, the mannanase-encoding gene, atman <dig>  is expressed in the micropylar endosperm and in the radicle tip just before radicle emergence  <cit> . we assume that the high expression of psman <dig> in e <dig> embryos might facilitate their penetration into the nutritious megagametophyte.

early embryogenesis is a critical developmental phase when the apical-basal polarity is established through directional auxin transport mainly mediated by auxin influx and efflux carriers  <cit> . in addition, flavonols can act as negative regulators of auxin transport  <cit> . attt <dig> encodes flavonoid 3′hydroxylase, a flavonol biosynthetic enzyme. down-regulation of pstt <dig> from stage e <dig> might reflect that auxin transport is increased from the cleavage stage and during further embryo development. previous studies have associated the action of expansins in cell wall loosening, expansion, dissemble or separation  <cit> . a high expression of psexpb <dig> at stage e <dig> might indicate the importance of loosening the cell walls to allow separation of the four early embryos. atserk <dig> marks cells that are competent to form embryos, and it also influences the competence of the cells to differentiate into embryos  <cit> . the high expression of psserk <dig> at stage e <dig> might be important for stimulating the four apical cells to differentiate into separate embryos and thereby stimulate the cleavage process to start. directly after the first cleavage, the four new embryos should develop further. we assume that down-regulation of psserk <dig> is important for blocking a second round of cleavage.

another set of transcripts, represented by putative homologs to cyp78a <dig>  dwarf in light  <dig>  and rop-interactive crib motif-containing protein  <dig> , were also highly abundant at stage e <dig> but declined successively during later developmental stages.

cytochrome p450s are involved in the metabolism of most phytohormones and many secondary metabolites in plant cells. overexpression of a member of the cyp78a family in rice  promotes cell proliferation but reduces the size of the embryos  <cit> . furthermore, the gene product of atdfl <dig>  which is involved in auxin signal transduction, can inhibit cell elongation  <cit> . before the development of the dominant embryo, the four early embryos are equal-sized. although it is not known which mechanisms are restricting the growth of the embryonal mass of stage  <dig> embryos, our results indicate that pscyp78a and psdfl <dig> might be involved. atric <dig> is important for tip growth of pollen tubes  <cit> . early embryos in pinus, developing after the cleavage process, begin their development by apical cell growth  <cit> . a high expression of psric <dig> at stage e <dig> and e <dig> might reflect that these embryos develop by apical cell growth.

the level of transcripts related to nac <dig>  fama, protodermal factor <dig> , and viviparous <dig>  were low at stage e <dig> but increased during later stages. putative homologs to plantacyanin  and glyoxalase i  showed a higher accumulation at stage e3do. in addition, a peak of transcript abundance in subordinate embryos was observed for transcripts related to wox <dig>  wox8/ <dig>  aintegumenta-like  <dig> , phosphoglucan water dikinase , myo-inositol oxygenase  <dig> , alfin-like  <dig>  and a transcript encoding auxin-dormancy-related protein.


anac <dig> is expressed in root cap stem cells where it promotes periclinal cell divisions  <cit> . fama, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, regulates a critical switch between division and differentiation during stomatal development  <cit> . in norway spruce, the apical-basal polarization during early embryogeny proceeds through the establishment of the meristematic cells of the embryonal mass and the terminally differentiated, expanding suspensor cells  <cit> . the high expression of psnac <dig> and psfama at stage e3do and e <dig>  but not at stage e3su, may reflect the importance of correct cell division pattern for the development of dominant embryos. pawox8/ <dig> regulates the orientation of the cell division plane in the basal part of the embryonal mass during early and late embryogeny in norway spruce  <cit> . in accordance, pswox8/ <dig> was expressed at all analysed developmental stages, however, the expression was significantly higher at stage e3su. although we do not know how overexpression of pawox8/ <dig> affects early embryo development, it is tempting to assume that the high expression of pswox8/ <dig> in subordinate embryos inhibits further development of the embryos or is only a consequence of a blocked development caused by other factors. in arabidopsis plants overexpressing atarpn, the endothecium degenerates, probably as a consequence of plantacyanin-induced precocious pcd  <cit> . the terminally differentiated suspensor cells in early embryos of scots pine and norway spruce are eliminated by pcd  <cit> . the high expression of psarpn in e3do and e <dig> embryos, but not in e3su, coincides with the degeneration of the suspensor cells. taken together, these results suggest that the apical-basal polarization is strictly regulated in dominant embryos but not in subordinate embryos.


picea abies homeobox  <dig> , a homolog of atpdf <dig>  and pawox <dig> are important for specification of the protoderm in somatic embryos of norway spruce  <cit> . furthermore the expression of a norway spruce ltp gene  switches from a uniform expression in proembryogenic masses to a protoderm-specific localization in developing somatic embryos  <cit> . we assume that the differential expression of psltp <dig> and pspdf <dig> is reflecting specification of the protoderm, which would indicate that radial patterning is regulated in a similar way in dominant and subordinate embryos. the expression pattern of pswox <dig> was similar to that of pswox8/ <dig>  both transcripts were expressed at all developmental stages, but with significantly higher levels in subordinate embryos. this is probably related to the blocked development of the subordinate embryos.

we have previously shown that pshap3a is expressed during the morphogenic phase and psvp <dig> during the maturation phase  <cit> . pshap3a was down-regulated in both e3do and e3su embryos, while psvp <dig> was up-regulated in e3do but not in e3su embryos. overexpression of the arabidopsis embryomaker , which is identical to atail <dig>  results in the formation of embryo-like structures on seedlings  <cit> . the authors concluded that atemk is a key player to maintain embryonic identity. the psail <dig> transcript was down-regulated in e3do but not in e3su embryos. taken together, the low expression of psvp <dig> and high expression of psail <dig> in the subordinate embryos indicate that the transition from the morphogenic phase to the maturation phase is not completed in the subordinate embryos.


although the functions of genes encoding for proteins related to pwd, miox <dig>  al <dig> and an auxin-dormancy related protein during embryo development are not known, the fact that they are differentially expressed in e3do and e3su embryos indicates differences in metabolic processes between dominant and subordinate embryos.

based on the processes identified in the go enrichment analyses and the expression of the selected transcripts we suggest that processes related to embryogenic competence and cell wall loosening are involved in activating the cleavage process. directly after cleavage, the growth of the embryos is restricted. apical-basal polarization is strictly regulated in the dominant embryo, which has reached the maturation phase. however, functional studies must be performed before we will understand the processes controlling the successive development of the early embryos.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have analysed changes in transcript accumulation during early seed development. go enrichment analysis of transcripts differentially expressed in embryos and megagametophytes highlighted the importance of different cellular processes and functions related to dna replication and translation in embryos and accumulation of storage material and transcripts responding to different stimuli in megagametophytes. transcripts related to embryogenic competence, cell wall modifications, cell division pattern, axis specification, and response to hormones and stress factors were highly abundant and differentially expressed during embryo development. the abundance of representative dets during different stages of embryo development was verified by qrt-pcr analyses.

however, it has to be kept in mind that we have had to focus on genes that have been characterized in angiosperms. further functional studies of the differentially expressed genes, and at least those which have been annotated to angiosperm genes without known function or that completely lack an angiosperm homolog, will increase our understanding of the regulation of embryo development in pinus.
