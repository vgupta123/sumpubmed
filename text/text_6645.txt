BACKGROUND
contemporary studies of biological systems are increasingly dependent upon detailed knowledge of genomic sequences, as well as spatiotemporal data on gene expression in cells and tissues. this need is being met in part by a growing but limited number of published complete genomic sequences that are now available for many of the most studied model organisms, but for many important and useful species this is not currently the case, though the ever-decreasing cost of large scale sequencing leads to some optimism that this will change in the near future. for functional genomic studies, however, the significantly more modest investment required for creating transcript databases of expressed sequence tags derived from cdna libraries has provided the opportunity to pursue gene discovery and functional genetic studies in the absence of a fully sequenced genome. we report here the creation of a transcriptome resource for the medicinal leech, an organism with a long history of contributions in neuroscience.

the medicinal leech, hirudo medicinalis, is an important model system for the study of nervous system structure, function, development, regeneration and repair. it is also a unique species in being presently approved for use in medical procedures, such as clearing of pooled blood following certain surgical procedures  <cit> . it is a current, and potentially also future, source of medically useful molecular factors, such as anticoagulants and antibacterial peptides  <cit> , which may have evolved as a result of its parasitizing large mammals, including humans. because of its relative simplicity and accessibility, the central nervous system  the medicinal leech, hirudo medicinalis, has been extensively studied and analyzed. central neurons can be identified, beginning early in embryogenesis, and most have been characterized anatomically and physiologically, their synaptic connectivities assayed, and their roles in particular behaviors determined  <cit> . the leech cns has also become a focus for studies of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of development, regeneration and repair, as well as the interface of neural function and the innate immune response  <cit> . recent advances in the application of contemporary molecular genetic and biochemical techniques to studies of the leech nervous system, including rna interference  <cit>  and ectopic gene expression in single identified cells  <cit>  or groups of cells  <cit> , as well as mass spectrometry  imaging of embryonic whole mounts and adult sections  <cit> , have opened the door to detailed studies of the mechanisms underlying fundamental biological phenomena.

leeches are annelids with a fixed number of segments , in contrast to other annelid groups , which have variable numbers. the cns of the leech consists of  <dig> bilateral neuromeres, of which the  <dig> anterior-most fuse to form the sub-esophageal ganglion and the  <dig> posterior-most fuse to form the tail ganglion. individual ganglia in mid-body segments are comprised of single bilateral neuromeres connected to each other by a bilateral pair of nerves  and a single small medial nerve , and to the periphery by two or three bilateral pairs of nerves  that branch in stereotypic patterns. in addition, many sensory neurons in the body wall and other internal organs comprise the peripheral nervous system , providing a variety of sensory information to the cns.

in hirudinid leeches, each segmental ganglionic primordium gives rise to ~ <dig> neurons  <cit> . most of these occur as bilateral pairs , but 5-8% are unpaired, with at least some becoming unpaired through cell death  <cit> . thus, understanding how a leech segmental ganglion functions requires, in principle, detailed knowledge of the function and connectivity of only ~200- <dig> individual neurons. moreover, since each segmental ganglion is a variation on a theme , the leech has one of the most accessible nervous systems from a systems analysis point of view. current knowledge of which neurons contribute to the activity of neuronal circuits responsible for generating specific behavioral responses  is becoming much more complete as a result of the recent and successful application of multi-neuronal functional imaging to leech ganglia  <cit> .

lacking within this constellation of detailed knowledge about the nervous system of the medicinal leech are genomic and transcriptomic sequence databases of sufficient size to enable detailed genetic functional studies. this paucity led us to undertake the construction of est libraries, particularly from neural tissue, the sequencing of over  <dig>  clones, and the generation and analysis of a representative transcriptomic database reported herein. the generation of these resources paves the way for an in-depth examination of genetic pathways involved in development and regeneration of the nervous system as well as mechanisms of neuroimmunity.

RESULTS
generation and assembly of total embryonic and adult cns ests
our general goal was to define a large  representative set of the genes expressed in the embryonic and adult central nervous systems of the medicinal leech that would be useful in future analyses of neural development, neural regeneration and repair, neural stress responses and neural innate immune responses.

to this end, we generated expressed sequence tags  from two cdna libraries derived from  multiple embryonic stages and  adult central nervous system . this approach has been successfully used in the past to identify the set of transcribed genes specific to an organ or tissue of a particular organism .

after subtraction of the most abundant clones, the libraries were sequenced using different strategies at three separate sites. sequencing at the university of iowa included embryonic clones and adult cns clones, mostly from the 3' end; at the joint genome institute sequences were generated starting at both 5' and 3' ends of clones from the embryonic cdna library; and at genoscope, sequences were generated only from the 5' ends of adult nervous system library clones exclusively. a total of  <dig>  reads were generated,  <dig>   representing embryonic transcripts and  <dig>   adult transcripts; the contributions from each source are enumerated in table  <dig>  of these, 76% were sequenced 5' to 3', and 24% 3' to 5'.

the ~ <dig>  raw sequences represent ~ <dig>  ×  <dig> nucleotides. raw sequences were trimmed of vector and repetitive as well as low-quality sequences, yielding  <dig>  high-quality masked ests with an average read length of  <dig> nt. some of the sequences were paired  and if they overlapped, were merged. these operations removed about 5% of the raw sequence data, leaving ~ <dig>  ×  <dig> nucleotides and an average sequence length of  <dig> nt.

the sequences were assembled using the phrap program, which yielded  <dig>  contiguous sequences . about 20% of these were sufficiently similar to others that they might be considered repeats. they might also represent genetic variants since our libraries likely contain transcripts from two very closely related species of european medicinal leeches, hirudo medicinalis and hirudo verbana  <cit> . or, they may represent splice variants. since splice variation is abundant in the human cns  <cit> , our assembly was tuned to preserve small variations as separate transcripts . thus, we estimate that these complete and partial transcripts may represent ~ <dig>  unique gene structures. 3% of the transcripts were assembled from only embryonic sequences, 23% from only adult cns sequences, and 74% from clones derived from both sources. of the total  <dig>  ests,  <dig>  contributed non-redundant information to the assembly. the remaining ests matched subsequences of contributing ests. table  <dig> shows the numbers of contiguous sequences that were assembled from different numbers of non-redundant ests;  <dig>  transcripts are assembled from two or more ests, and  <dig>  are singletons, of which  <dig>  matched no assembled transcript at any percent identity.

contigs resulting from the clustering of  <dig> to  <dig> ests

computational analysis of the sequence data was performed to evaluate sequence redundancy within and across datasets, sequencing quality, and transcript paralogy .

annotation of the assembled sequences: interspecies comparisons
the  <dig>  sequences from the merged input sets were pairwise aligned with blastx using default parameters with the non-redundant set of public protein sequences, nr, downloaded from genbank, maintained at ncbi . for each query sequence, its suite of pairwise alignments was evaluated to select a well-supported description line and to build a weighted index of descriptive words. using a relevance scoring algorithm based on alignment qualities , the most relevant description was selected as representative for the query sequence.

numbers of amino acid sequence top matches of translated hirudo clustered ests to protein sequences available in public databases of seven organisms with sequenced genomes. the order of the species reflects the descending number of first rank matches, i.e., the number of instances where the best match was to a particular species. numbers in bold are maxima for each rank

to construct the seven-proteome comparison to the hirudo transcripts, six-frame translations of transcripts were compared with complete proteomes from seven organisms selected to range in phylogenetic distance from hirudo. for each transcript, for each proteome, the rank from one to seven of the best match was counted. of note, no proteome consistently had the best match or even the top three matches for hirudo, and every proteome contributed at least a few best matching proteins, with c. elegans lowest at  <dig> proteins with a match rank of  <dig> 

another way to compare the hirudo data to those of the same set of species is shown in figure  <dig>  where the number of matches is plotted versus average percent identity at the amino acid level for the same comparison group. again, the closest species is h. robusta and the most distant is c. elegans. in the middle range of 30-50% identity, the number of matches of translated hirudo transcripts is approximately the same to the vertebrates as it is to the two other annelids, and significantly higher than to either drosophila or caenorhabditis. of general interest is the small cohort of protein domains that remain perfectly or nearly perfectly conserved across all seven organisms, represented by the alignments in the 91-100% range.

comparison of translated open reading frames  with the other openly available leech datasets, the genome and transcriptome of helobdella robusta, shows an average identity at the amino acid level of 58% in matched sequences. interestingly, comparison with other available lophotrochozoans shows similar high levels of amino acid identity where sequences match, for example, 64% with capitella capitata   <cit>  and 56% with aplysia californica   <cit> , as well as 58% with schistosoma mansoni   <cit> 

these results support the idea that, evolutionarily, the annelids have diverged less from the chordates than have the more highly derived arthropods and nematodes  <cit> . this is further supported by the analysis of a specific group of functionally related proteins, those involved in the innate immune response, as discussed below.

gene ontology analysis of neural proteins represented in the hirudo transcript database
to test the potential representation of genes in the hirudo transcriptome database that might be involved in nervous system structure, function or development, we aligned six-frame translations of the ~ <dig>  unique transcripts  against the gene ontology data in all relevant categories. overall, we obtained  <dig>  matches against  <dig> of the  <dig> categories that include the defining term "neuro" and have representative sequences in the gene ontology database. the number of matches for any one term ranged from  <dig> to a maximum of  <dig> . table  <dig> presents the number of hirudo matches for  <dig> go categories that are relevant to neuronal development and have the largest numbers of matching transcripts. numbers of transcripts assigned to each neural process are shown, including numbers assembled from embryo library sequences only, from cns libraries only, and from a mix of ests from both types of libraries. embryo-only, cns-only, and "mixed" were determined based on the full set of 133k ests, not just the non-redundant contributing ests. the total number of unique leech transcripts that matched these  <dig> categories is  <dig> .

partial hirudo protein sequences were extracted from the alignment data and annotated with their corresponding go categories. . our results indicate that the hirudo transcript database contains a significant number of neural sequences, and that it will provide a useful resource for exploring various aspects of nervous system function and development.

innate immunity response genes in hirudo
the innate immune response is an evolutionarily ancient defense strategy against pathogens that has been documented widely in living organisms, including plants and fungi as well as invertebrate and vertebrate animals. in vertebrates, its major functions include:  recruiting immune system cells to infection sites though the production of chemokines and cytokines;  activating the complement cascade in order to identify pathogens, activate cells to promote pathogen clearance and stimulate the adaptative immune response;  interacting specifically with pathogens through membrane or cytosolic receptors in leukocytes in order to remove pathogens from organs and tissues;  activating the adaptative immune response though antigen presentation processes  <cit> .

to search for the major players for these four functions, we screened the hirudo transcriptome database for possible homologs of vertebrate genes in these categories. the results of this analysis are shown in table  <dig>  the  <dig> different transcripts identified fell into eight groups relevant to the immune system, including: pattern recognition receptors , prr pathways, cytokine-related molecules, complement system factors, clotting and fibrinolytic cascades, cluster of differentiation related genes, effector genes and adaptive immune response factors.

numbers of hirudo transcripts identified as putative homologs of genes belonging to seven major groups implicated in the innate immune response, plus a group of potential representatives of the adaptive immune response. most transcripts are assembled from both whole embryo and adult cns est clones, with ~3% present exclusively in the embryonic clones and ~18% exclusively in the adult cns. identification of individual transcripts and the corresponding names of their putative homologs can be found in additional file  <dig> 

as can be seen in table  <dig>  of the  <dig> transcripts identified in the database as putatively related to immunity,  <dig> were derived from est clones obtained from adult cns tissues, suggesting that the nervous system is deeply involved in and capable of mounting a fully capable innate immune response. a caveat that needs to be considered is that the leech cns normally resides within a blood sinus and is therefore continuously in contact with cells of the blood and circulatory system, including fibroblasts, macrophages and microglia, which have been implicated in immune responses in various systems. some of these may have been carried with the dissected adult nervous systems that provided the mrna from which the est libraries were made. further work will be essential in order to determine whether neurons and neuroglia do express all of the factors we have identified as neuronal or not.

we also determined the numbers of individual est clones in the raw data that showed high sequence overlap  as a way to gain some measure of the relative abundances of the putative immune system transcripts present in the est libraries. as can be seen in this table, with a 90% nucleotide match criterion, the numbers of clones matching the assembled transcripts range from a single one to over several hundred. the significance of this variability in the frequency with which clones corresponding to these transcripts were picked needs to be explored in detail, but it does suggest that some components or some pathways are actively and continuously expressed at higher levels in the adult nervous system.

pattern recognition receptors 
danger signaling receptors are well conserved in leeches. the innate immune system uses different molecules that sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns. these include toll-like receptors , retinoic-acid-inducible gene- <dig>  receptors , and the nod-like receptors , all of which contain leucine rich repeat domains . some immunoglobulin superfamily members also contain lrr domains and are known as islrs , as for example the trk neurotrophin receptor protein  <cit> .

toll-like receptors 
in the hirudo est libraries reported here, our analysis led to the identification of  <dig> tlrs . the complete sequence of one of these, hmtlr <dig>  has been obtained and shows particular homology to the mouse tlr <dig>  <cit>  interestingly, in the leech nervous system hmtlr <dig> appears to be associated with the expression of a cytokine, emapii, following exposure to bacterial toxins or in response to a nerve crush  <cit> , but not with the expression of antimicrobial peptides known to be expressed by the central nervous system  <cit> . it is worth pointing out that these antimicrobial peptides  appear to exert neurotrophic effects after a nerve crush  <cit>  in line with recent data obtained in mammals  <cit> .

tlr pathways
analysis of the hirudo transcriptome database reveals the presence of putative homologs of nearly all factors reported to play critical roles in human tlr pathways, with the exception of homologs of trif, tab1/ <dig> and the endosome receptor . this stands in sharp contrast to other invertebrates, such as insects and nematodes, for which the prr pathways thus far appear to be much simpler, with many components missing. whether all the identified leech putative homologs indeed play similar functional roles remains to be shown by further analysis, but their presence in the transcriptome database adds support to the hypothesis that lophotrochozoan genetic programs are more closely related to those of vertebrates than are those of drosophila and caenorhabditis, two highly-derived members of the other major protostomian group, the ecdysozoans

immune effectors: antimicrobial peptides
several antimicrobial peptides  and destabilases sharing activities against gram+ and/or gram- bacteria have been detected and cloned from the hirudo cns  <cit>  . we have also identified putative leech homologs of serpins  and a tryptase inhibitor , which in other systems are known to be active against viruses like hiv or hepatitis c virus ns <dig> protease  <cit> .

cytokines
several cytokines have been identified recently in leech , e.g., one is related to human p43/endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide  <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, in the leech nervous system hmtlr <dig> appears to be associated with the expression of the cytokine emap <dig> following exposure to bacterial toxins or in response to a nerve crush  <cit>  but not with the expression of antimicrobial peptides also present in the nervous system  <cit> .

once activated, danger sensing receptors can promote the production of numerous molecular effectors like antimicrobial peptides , chemokines and cytokines. these factors participate in the recruitment of immune cells, development of the inflammatory response and finally, in mammals, the adapative immune response. among the effectors already discovered in leeches, hmtlr <dig> is linked to the cytokine related to emap <dig> in the context on the brain immune response after  <cit> . emap <dig> is the first cytokine-related molecule characterized in invertebrate nervous systems. in mammals, emap <dig> is known to participate in the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear phagocytes, to promote endothelial apoptosis, and to enhance the expression of some other cytokines  <cit> .

complement
the hirudo database contains putative homologs of the majority of elements thought to participate in pathogen recognition in vertebrates through cell-membrane carbohydrate detection, opsonization and phagocytosis through c3-related protein and α <dig> macroglobulin-related protein . however, the first element already characterized in the leech brain, related to c1q, has been shown to be involved in microglial chemotaxis  <cit> .

cluster of differentiation  proteins
the cd system is commonly used as cell markers, allowing cells to be defined based on what molecules are present on their surface. in particular, cd proteins are often used to associate cells with certain immune functions. while using one cd molecule to define populations is uncommon , combining markers has allowed for cell types with very specific definitions within the immune system  <cit> . we detected several putative leech cds  that are similar to mammalian cds, e.g., hmcd <dig>  sharing 55% identity with human cd <dig>  and hmcd <dig>  hmcd <dig> and hmcd <dig> sharing 32%, 31% and 31% identity with mouse cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  these data are in line with the results obtained by de eguileor et al.,  <cit> , who used human monoclonal antibodies to detect different leech hemocytic cell types, e.g., macrophage-like cells positive for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd11b and cd11c, nk-like cells positive for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  and granulocytes positive for cd11b and cd11c.

adaptive immune response elements
the data discussed above indicate that the majority of proteins known to participate in the vertebrate innate immune response are present in the medicinal leech transcriptome. this raises an interesting question: are orthologs of factors implicated in the vertebrate adaptive immune response also present in the leech transcriptome? indeed, several are, including genes related to rag- <dig>  as well as calnexin, calreticulin, cathepsins and several others . for example, the hmrag- <dig> transcript in the hirudo database displays high sequence homology with vertebrate rag- <dig>  particularly in two mtn3/saliva domains . the presence of a rag- <dig> related gene in leech is suggestive of the presence of an adaptative response in these long-lived span animals  and opens the door to a reconsideration of the evolution of immune response. determining whether molecules sharing recombination signal sequence   <cit>  homology are present in the leech will be an important step towards establishing the presence of a real adaptive immune response in the medicinal leech, but the presence of rag- <dig> related genes in leech is consistent with recent data obtained in the aplysia genome, in which a n-rag-tp transposon encodes a protein similar to the n-terminal part of rag- <dig> in vertebrates has been discovered  <cit> . similarly, a rag1/2-like cluster has been found in the sea urchin genome  <cit> . these data are consistent with the theory that vj recombination reaction in jawed vertebrates catalyzed by the rag- <dig> and rag- <dig> proteins could have emerged approximately  <dig> million years ago from transposon-encoded proteins. interestingly, the "core" region of rag- <dig> required for its catalytic activity is significantly similar to the transposase encoded by dna transposons that belong to the transib superfamily. this superfamily was discovered recently based on computational analysis of the fruit fly, the african malaria mosquito, yellow fever mosquito, silkworm, dog hookworm, hydra, soybean rust and sea urchin genomes  <cit> . the leech rag-1-related molecule also aligns with the core part of the transib transposase from helicoverpa zea  <cit>  further supporting the hypothesis. the complete gene sequence will allow us, in the future, to confirm definitively its homology.

while these observations need to be supplemented by functional studies that confirm the tentative identifications, they do raise a question that needs to be fully explored: did the adaptive immune response evolve earlier than presently thought?

CONCLUSIONS
we expect that the open availability of the hirudo transcript database described herein will help researchers interested in pursuing both functional and comparative studies of proteins and peptides involved in many important biological phenomena. transcript sequence information is an essential complement to other on-going studies of the leech nervous system, making it possible to explore systemically the genetic programs and the molecular mechanisms that specify individual cns cells and their ensemble properties in this important model organism. since gene expression and function can now be assayed and modulated in individual leech neurons or groups of neurons, a systems level approach, focused on relating the neural expression of genetic programs to physiological programs, would be timely and perhaps uniquely feasible in the leech.

considering the immune response, our data suggest that a well conserved innate immune response, very similar to that found in vertebrates as well as other invertebrate species, including biomphalaria glabrata  <cit> , daphnia pulex  <cit> , crassostrea gigas  <cit> , aplysia  <cit> , and chlamys farreri  <cit> , is present in hirudo, but many details need to be explored further. the medicinal leech is a very important model for exploring interactions between danger sensing receptors in and anti-microbial responses to both bacteria and viruses, given its interactions over time with its human hosts. perhaps the most important aspect of the observations we are reporting here is that most if not all the immune factors and mechanisms we have identified appear to be present in the hirudo nervous system. thus, we have preliminary evidence that an essentially complete innate immune response occurs in the leech cns, especially after mechanical damage, such as a nerve crush, during the complex processes that underlie regeneration. thus, this model system will allow dissecting the cross-talk between neurons, macroglia and microglia cells, as well as cells and other factors found in the haemolymph. the leech ventral nerve cord is covered by a semi permeable protective capsule and resides within the ventral sinus of the circulatory system, thus being continuously bathed by haemolymph. this capsule and the interaction with blood resemble the mammalian hematological blood-brain barrier. hirudo, therefore, is an excellent model system for exploring fundamental questions about the interaction of the nervous and innate immune systems, including  what is the range of functions of microglia?  what are the interactions among neurons, glia and blood-borne cells in the responses to pathogens, mechanical damage and other stresses? and  what is the nature of the innate immune response mounted by the nervous system?
