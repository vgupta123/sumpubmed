BACKGROUND
tissue renewal and maintenance fundamentally depend on the activity of stem cells, which provide a pluripotent source to replace lost or damaged tissue. stem cells need to be tightly controlled through regulation of their proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation. disruption of this regulation can lead to severe consequences, such as age-related pathologies and cancer  <cit> . this important level of control is typically exerted by the microenvironments or niches in which the stem cells reside. cellular niches are comprised of highly specialized cells, often in defined locations within tissues, which provide anchorage to stem cells and contribute to signals that regulate stem cell maintenance, proliferation and differentiation. however, it is becoming clear that stem cells are also regulated by systemic signals that provide adaptation to the physiological status of the organism, in ways that are still not well understood. these systemic signals may for example mediate the effects of nutrition and exercise on stem cell maintenance and proliferation, with possible consequences for longevity and prolonging a healthy lifespan  <cit> . such physiological responses of stem cells and their daughter cell lineages also underlie the large capacity for remodelling of many tissues and organs observed in different organisms. for example the large changes in size of the mammary gland during pregnancy and post lactation  <cit> , and the reversible contraction and regrowth of the drosophila intestine during starvation and refeeding experiments  <cit> . little is known however regarding whether the niches themselves can be remodelled in response to environmental stimuli. however studies using stem cell transplantation  <cit>  and with cancer stem cells  <cit>  have suggested that niches can be more flexible and dynamic structures than previously thought.

drosophila oogenesis has been shown to be highly sensitive to diet. previous work has demonstrated a sixty-fold difference in egg laying between rich and poor food conditions  <cit>  mediated through several regulatory points during oogenesis. the germline stem cell  niche of the drosophila ovary has been instrumental in establishing the niche paradigm of stem cell regulation and provides one of the most highly characterized models of niche-stem cell interactions. the ovary is composed of sub-structures called ovarioles that consist of a chain of egg chambers, each at a different developmental stage. the germ line and somatic cell lineages are derived from two stem cell populations that are located in the germarium, which lies at the anterior tip of each ovariole  <cit> . the gscs reside in a highly defined location  comprising of well characterized and distinguishable somatic cell types found at the anterior of the germarium. five to six cap cells form the niche for two to three germline stem cells , providing anchorage via de-cadherin  <cit> . the cap cells in turn are located at the posterior end of the terminal filament, a line of cells extending anteriorly from the niche. the terminal filaments form during larval development and their number defines the number of niches and hence number of ovarioles in the ovary. the terminal filaments play a key role in recruiting cap cells to form the niche through activating notch signalling in cap cell precursors  <cit> . gscs locate to the niche during pupal development and begin proliferating asymmetrically to self-renew the gsc and to generate daughter cystoblasts that then undergo 4 cycles of mitosis to form a  <dig> cell germline cyst  <cit> . gscs thus maintain egg production throughout the lifespan of the adult. escort cells are located immediately adjacent to the niche and line the anterior germarium. their cellular processes invade between the cysts and help propel them posteriorly  <cit> . two somatic follicle stem cells  are bilaterally located approximately midway along the germarium and give rise to follicle cells that encapsulate each cyst to form successive egg chambers. the cap cell niche provides diffusible signals such as decapentaplegic, which regulates gsc maintenance  <cit> , and hedgehog, which acts at a distance to regulate ssc proliferation  <cit> . on a protein poor diet germline and somatic cell proliferation is reduced and cysts in region 2a/2b undergo apoptosis  <cit> . insulin-like peptides and the target of rapamycin  pathway control the response of the gscs to nutritional status  <cit> . insulin signalling also acts through notch in cap cells to maintain the niche  <cit>  and hence flies maintained constantly on poor diet show a loss of cap cells in aged flies compared to rich fed controls . although insulin signals are involved in long term gsc niche maintenance and rapidly affect gsc proliferation directly in response to diet, previous studies have not shown whether short-term dietary changes can have an impact on the niche size. in this study we show that the drosophila ovary gsc cap cell niche can contract and expand in fluctuating dietary conditions through cell fate transitions involving flanking somatic cells. cap cells are lost when adult flies are shifted to poor diet and notch signalling is reduced. returning flies to nutrient-rich medium restores notch signalling, expands the niche and delays loss of gscs. in old flies decreased notch signalling is associated with decreased robustness of the niche to dietary changes. the results suggest a key role of notch in controlling reversible niche remodelling in response to environmental change.figure  <dig>

RESULTS
diet reversibly regulates the size of the gsc niche
to identify and score cap cells we used combined staining with anti-laminc and the cell junction marker coracle . the terminal filament and cap cells express nuclear membrane laminc, which is not present in escort cells  <cit> . coracle staining is enriched in cap cells compared to terminal filament and escort cells and corresponds to other common utilised markers of cap cells  such as zonula occludens- <dig>   <cit>  and engrailed  <cit> . cap cells also have a distinctive rounded morphology compared to terminal filament and escort cells. we investigated the consequence on the gsc niche of culturing wild type  flies on protein rich and poor conditions by maintaining adult flies from eclosion on either our standard fly culture medium  or standard medium protein-enriched by supplementation with live yeast paste . addition of yeast paste has previously been shown to lead to substantial differences in rates of oogenesis and gsc proliferation  <cit> . however we observed no change in cap cell number over a prolonged time course . gscs showed a slow reduction in numbers over time after eclosion but this was similar in both dietary conditions . therefore we instead cultured flies on a protein/glucose -depleted medium, which lacked both yeast paste and supplementary glucose. we observed a reduction in niche size that was apparent 15 days after eclosion . gsc numbers declined over time in these conditions but we observed no significant difference compared to st and st + yeast media . flies kept on agar showed a more rapid loss of cap cells which was evident by 6 days after eclosion and a significant decrease in gscs compared to all other medium conditions . thus diet can affect both niche size and gsc numbers with progressively more severe and rapid effects as nutritional content is reduced.

fly ovaries can reversibly adapt egg-laying rates to changes in diet  <cit> . therefore we wondered if changes in the niche size would be similarly reversible. when flies were shifted back to st + yeast after either  <dig> or 24 days on p/g-depleted medium, a recovery in cap cell number was observed . we also observed higher numbers of gscs 9 days after flies were shifted to richer nutrient conditions, compared to unshifted flies. thus there is a delayed decline in gsc number associated with the dietary shift compared to flies kept in constant nutritional conditions . a similar recovery in cap cells was observed when flies were first starved for 6 days on agar and then shifted for 9 days to st + yeast .

diet can reversibly regulate notch signalling in the niche and escort cells
we next investigated if different medium conditions could affect the levels of notch signalling which is known to be required for maintenance of cap cell number in adult flies. we first examined the expression pattern of different notch signal reporter lines since different reporters are known to be tissue-dependent  <cit> . as previously reported the enhancer of split m7-lacz   <cit>  construct was expressed in the cap cells  while enhancer of split mβ <dig> -lacz   <cit>  was found to express in the escort cells and to a lesser extent in cap cells . m7-lacz expression showed a small decrease in 3 day old adults on st medium compared to st + yeast and a further reduction in signalling on p/g-depleted medium . mβ-lacz expression showed a strong reduction on st medium compared to st + yeast and this minimal level was not further reduced when flies were on p/g-depleted medium . thus different reporters exhibit both differences in spatial distribution of expression and different sensitivities to altered dietary composition. the stronger loss of notch signalling on p/g-depleted medium may explain why we detected cap cell loss with this medium and not with standard medium.figure  <dig>

we investigated if notch signalling through the different reporters changed over a time course after eclosion. on st + yeast, m7-lacz expression showed a small decrease at 9 days post eclosion and was strongly reduced by 15 days . in contrast to this age-dependent reduction we found that the mβ-lacz reporter lines showed little change over time in flies maintained on st + yeast after eclosion . we next investigated how a timeline of nutrient down and upshifts  affected notch activity. on p/g-depleted medium m7-lacz expression showed a noticeable reduction after 3 days post eclosion with further declines up to 9 days . mβ-lacz was lost more rapidly reaching minimal expression in 3 day old adults . when flies kept on p/g-depleted medium were shifted back to st + yeast at 6 days after eclosion we found different responses of the two reporters. after shifting to st + yeast medium, m7-lacz expression showed no recovery , but mβ-lacz expression levels were restored after 1 day . we wondered if the age-dependent reduction of m7-lacz expression was the underlying reason for the lack of recovery of its expression in flies undergoing nutrient up-shifts at 9 days. we therefore made use of the more rapid response and recovery allowed by keeping flies on agar-only medium. there was a strong loss of m7-lacz expression in these younger adult flies after 3 days post eclosion in starvation conditions, followed by a recovery of m7-lacz after a further three days on st + yeast . the reduced notch signalling in aged flies correlated with a less robust niche, which had a shorter lag time to niche reduction and loss of gscs after switching to a p/g-depleted medium , compared to similar shifts of young adult flies on eclosion .figure  <dig>

loss and recovery of notch signalling reversibly regulates cap cell number
to investigate whether altering notch signalling could also reversibly affect niche size we used the nts <dig> and nts <dig> temperature sensitive alleles  <cit> , which allow normal notch function at 18°c but produce strong notch loss of function when flies are shifted to 29°c. flies were shifted from 18°c to 29°c on eclosion and the population sampled at different time points for oogenesis phenotypes. as previously published  <cit>  we observed a decline in cap cell number over time for both notch alleles, while the niche size for wt controls at 29°c remained stable . we did not find any evidence that loss of cap cells resulted from apoptosis . notch mutant flies that remained at 18°c also did not show a significant decline in cap cell number. similarly, we observed a greater decrease in gsc number over time in temperature shifted nts mutant flies compared to wt at 29°c and 18°c controls . these phenotypes were accompanied by a reduction of escort cell invasion between cysts and the onset of expected follicle packaging phenotypes . we investigated if the observed phenotypes could be reversed by transferring flies to 18°c part way through the time course to restore notch activity. when the temperature down-shift was initiated  <dig> or 9 days into the time course we observed niche recovery. gsc numbers similarly recovered , as did other ovariole phenotypes affecting cyst packaging . notch signalling thus has an impact on numerous cell types in the germarium, including the cap cells, to maintain their function in the ovary. we next investigated the effect of a dominant gain of function notch mutant allele abruptexe <dig>   <cit> . although, on eclosion, the niches of axe2/+ flies were comprised of a similar number of cap cells as wild type, the numbers subsequently increased in the axe2/+ niches after eclosion . however gsc numbers, although they were initially higher than wild type, eventually declined to wild type levels despite the larger niche , suggesting that a subtle balance of notch activity levels in the adult germarium affects the cap cell to gsc ratio. the reversibility of the niche phenotypes shows that there are two ways that notch can function to maintain cap cell number. notch acts to prevent loss of cap cells but also functions to re-expand the niche.figure  <dig>

spatially distinct notch functions are associated with niche contraction and recovery
the two identified functions of notch that control niche size may reside in the same or different cell types. thus altered notch signalling in different tissues might directly or indirectly contribute to either cap cell loss or niche restoration. notch null cap cell clones generated during development fail to be incorporated into the niche indicating notch function during development of the niche is cell autonomous  <cit> . however it is not known whether niche maintenance in the adult only depends on notch signalling in the cap cells or whether other cell types are involved in supporting cap cell numbers. the cap cell niche is reported to be post mitotic  <cit>  ruling out use of clone induction in adults to investigate requirements that are specific for adult functions. we therefore utilized a number of gal <dig> lines to express constitutively active notch intracellular domain  or notch rnai in different cell types. in order to generate notch gain and loss of function only in the adult, we created fly stocks carrying both the gal <dig> driver and a temperature sensitive gal80ts construct  <cit> . the bric-a-brac1-gal <dig>  drives expression in cap cells, in the terminal filament and more weakly in the anterior escort cells  <cit> . in contrast patched-gal <dig>  and c587-gal <dig> express only in adult escort cells  <cit> . the c306-gal <dig> line expresses in the follicle cell region of the germarium  <cit>  and engrailed-gal <dig>  expresses in all the cells of the terminal filament but not the cap or escort cells  <cit> . nanos-gal <dig> expresses in the germline but not in the somatic cells of the germarium  <cit> . thus by considering the overlapping and distinctive expression patterns of different gal <dig> drivers it is possible to infer the spatial requirements for notch function . flies were kept at 18°c during development and then switched to 29°c at eclosion to induce gal <dig> expression. we confirmed gal4-gal80ts functionality by expressing uas-cd8-gfp at 18°c and 29°c. gfp expression was observed at 29°c but not at 18°c . to investigate if increased activation of notch signalling can function to increase the adult niche size we expressed constitutively active nicd. separately the uas-nicd line and the different gal <dig> drivers did not cause an increase in niche size  while c587-gal <dig> and ptc-gal <dig> driven nicd expression resulted in an increase in cap cell number . bromodeoxyuridine  labelling showed that this niche expansion did not depend on cell division . in contrast, no increase in cap cell number was noted with en-gal <dig>  c306-gal <dig> or bab1-gal <dig> . in the adult ovary c587-gal <dig> and ptc-gal <dig> express strongly in the escort cells and not the cap cells and bab1-gal <dig> expresses in cap cells and less strongly than other drivers in escort cells. therefore we can conclude that notch acts in escort cells to increase niche size, presumably by a transition to a cap cell phenotype. c587-gal <dig> driven nicd resulted in similar increase of cap cell numbers on both rich and p/g-depleted medium showing that nutritional control acts upstream of proteolytic activation of notch . as with axe2/+ flies  the increase in cap cell number induced by deregulated notch signalling was not associated with a net increase in gsc number . nevertheless we identified a population of escort cells that responded to nicd expression by increasing the numbers of niche cells expressing cap cell markers.figure  <dig>

to examine which cells were sensitive to notch loss of function we expressed notch rnai in adult flies, which were dissected on eclosion, and after 6 days or 15 days. the separate uas lines were also out-crossed to wt flies. none of the lines individually showed any significant loss of cap or gscs compared to wild type flies between eclosion and the 15 day time point . notch rnai expressed by different gal <dig> drivers resulted in distinct outcomes. en-gal <dig> driven notch rnai in the terminal filament did not show any phenotypes throughout the timeline . bab1-gal <dig> driven notch-rnai caused a significant loss of cap cells over time . reduction of gsc numbers was also observed . c587-gal <dig> and ptc-gal <dig> driven notch rnai showed a strong loss of gscs and a small reduction was seen when notch rnai was expressed in follicle cells . however, despite disruption to other germarium cell types, none of the drivers apart from bab1-gal <dig> resulted in a significant loss of cap cells when driving notch rnai expression . we also observed no phenotypes when notch rnai was driven only in the germline with nanos-gal <dig> , consistent with previous results that failed to find a function for notch in germline cells  <cit> . by taking into account the distinctive expression patterns of the different gal <dig> drivers we conclude that notch signalling is required only in the cap cells for adult niche maintenance but indirect effects of notch in other somatic tissues also affect gsc number. our combined data thus shows that notch acts separately in cap cells and escort cells to maintain or re-expand the niche.figure  <dig>

discussion
stem cells often reside in defined cellular niches adhered to specialized support cells. these niches provide a favourable environment and signals to maintain a stable population of stem cells. changes to the activity and population level of stem cells are closely associated with tissue homeostasis, repair and remodelling to different physiological inputs. little is known however regarding how niches are normally regulated and altered during the lifespan of an individual or how they respond to its physiological status or the organism’s environment. this is in part due to lack of a well-characterized and experimentally accessible model whereby environmental changes to the niche and to the niche regulatory signals can be observed with defined outcomes. here we have uncovered an unexpected plasticity of the drosophila ovary gsc niche. we have found that the niche can contract and re-expand in response to altered notch signalling, a dynamic response which we have also linked to dietary regulation. we have defined two spatially distinct activities of notch that regulate adult cap cell number. notch can act in the adult cap cells to prevent their loss while increased notch activation in the escort cells causes niche expansion. the reversible response of the niche to dietary composition may be an adaptive response to tune niche activity to external environmental conditions allowing a restoration of niche capacity if there is a return to conditions more productive for offspring survival. intriguingly we found that after keeping adult flies on p/g-depleted medium, the transfer back to st + yeast medium delayed the loss of gscs compared to flies maintained in constant nutritional conditions whether rich or poor. it is intriguing therefore to speculate that a boost of niche signalling capacity on restoration of the niche might have a rejuvenating effect on gsc survival, but our current study does not discriminate the latter possibility from direct effects of dietary history on the gscs. however we do note that restoration of notch activity by temperature down shifts of nts mutants does restore the gsc capacity of the niche. interestingly we found, using rnai, that disrupting notch function in escort and follicle cells separately led to reduction of gsc numbers without decreasing the niche size, while constant high level of notch signalling in escort cells caused niche expansion without sustaining increased gsc numbers. previously song et al., using a different method to express activated notch in mitotic clones of escort cells, also concluded that sustained high activation of notch did not result in recruitment of additional gscs to the escort cells  <cit> . intriguingly we found that the gain of function axe <dig> mutation of notch produced first a gain then a loss of gscs in a time course analysis. this suggests the level and duration of notch signalling is important in determining the outcome, and this has to be considered when interpreting the lack of gsc recruitment after constitutively active nicd is expressed. our rnai data also indicate that that multiple mechanisms involving notch in various somatic cell types are involved in regulating the gsc to cap cell ratio in the niche.

surprisingly our results did not replicate the finding that poor diet accelerated the decline of gsc number compared to rich diet that has been previously reported  <cit> . in our analysis, gsc loss was similar when flies were kept continuously on rich and poor conditions. only starvation conditions led to a loss of gscs a loss of gscs compared to fed flies were less robust to later dietary shifts to poor diet. additionally we did not observe a decline in cap cell numbers with age on rich medium or indeed on our standard medium lacking yeast paste, only when glucose supplement was removed did we observe an age-dependent decline of cap cells. it is possible that fly strain differences or different diet regimes may explain these different outcomes, but our results demonstrate that age-dependent decline of gscs does not necessarily imply a change in cap cell number, consistent with our findings that multiple mechanisms control gsc to cap cell ratio.

the dynamic changes to the niche in response to diet correlated with changes in expression of the notch lacz reporters m7-lacz and mβ-lacz, which showed distinct spatial and age-dependent differences. both m <dig> and mβ expression were reduced on poor diets and could be restored on shifting to rich media. but m7-lacz also showed a decline in expression with fly age even on rich medium and hence was only restored on nutrient up-shifts in adults that were less than 1 week of age post-eclosion. the age-dependent decline of m7-lacz expression in the cap cells was associated with a decreased robustness of the niche when aged flies were transferred to a poor diet. the plasticity and dynamic responses of the cap cell niche thus provide a read out of the physiological status of the fly, integrating both environmental and age-dependent changes. at present we do not know how the expression of the m <dig> and mβ reporter genes are spatially and temporally uncoupled from each other, but other studies have suggested that different co-regulatory inputs may cause tissue-dependent differences in the expression of different notch target genes  <cit> . it will be interesting to discern how notch signalling levels and responses in cap and escort cells depend on distinct or overlapping nutrient sensing mechanisms. insulin signalling has previously been shown to play a role in maintaining a stable niche over the fly lifespan by promoting notch activity and appears to mediate differences in cap cell number in flies maintained in constant rich or poor conditions  <cit> . changes to insulin signalling are therefore a strong candidate to mediate the reversible nutrient regulation of the niche size that we observe. it is likely however that additional nutrient-sensing mechanisms such as tor signalling are also involved. for example a number of studies have shown that nutrient sensing at the cellular and systemic levels can converge to cooperatively regulate cell proliferation growth and metabolism in different physiological contexts  <cit> . our data do not as yet rule out the possibility that the notch response in the cap cells might reflect an indirect consequence, lying downstream of global changes initiated by nutritionally regulated signals, although the rapidity of the mβ − lacz response, together with previously published data indicating the cell autonomous requirement of notch in cap cells for their maintenance  <cit> , strongly argue against this caveat.

our data ruled out the possibility of adult niche expansion through mitosis of the cap cells and instead suggests a model in which cell fate transitions between cap cells and adjacent escort cells cause the changes to adult niche size . previous work has shown that overexpression of nicd in undifferentiated somatic precursor cells in the developing ovary cause greatly expanded niche sizes  <cit> , reflecting the role of notch in niche recruitment and demonstrating some plasticity in the developmental lineage. however in the adult ovary we found that widespread nicd expression in differentiated escort cells resulted in only a small but reproducible expansion of cap cell numbers suggesting only a limited number of adult cells retained the capacity to trans-differentiate. interestingly a relationship has previously been shown in the drosophila testis gsc niche between the niche hub cells and the adjacent cyst cells. in the male gsc niche the cyst cells are somatic cells, which surround the developing germline cysts in a way that is somewhat analogous to the escort cells and follicle cells of the drosophila ovary  <cit> . like the follicle cells  <cit>  but unlike the escort cells  <cit> , the cyst cells are continually turning over and are derived from proliferating cyst stem cells   <cit> . the hub cells are post mitotic and are developmentally derived from a common precursor to the cyscs. interestingly in the absence of a transcriptional regulator called lines, cyscs differentiate into hub-like cells  <cit> . in the adult it has been reported that there is a steady state turnover of the hub cell niche and that niche size is maintained by adoption of hub cell fate by cyscs  <cit> . however a later study found this conversion was not significant  <cit> . it will be interesting to determine whether this discrepancy was due to environmental differences and if similar dietary regulation affects the male gsc niche. a previous study  <cit>  has shown that the number of gscs and cyscs in the male testes are reversibly affected by diet but did not distinguish whether there was an outcome on the number of hub cells themselves.figure  <dig> 
nutrient-dependent plasticity of the gsc niche. model of nutrient-responsive niche dynamics through notch-dependent cell fate transitions between cap cells and an adjacent pool of nascent niche cells, likely a sub-population of escort cells, regulated by dietary inputs.



few other niches have been characterized in such detail as the drosophila gsc niche, but there is some evidence that niches in other systems may have a post-developmental plasticity. for example transplanted mouse hair follicle stem cells have been shown to organize a functional niche to maintain hair growth in recipient nude mice  <cit> . age-related changes to niches have also been observed. in the mouse hippocampus, for example, age-dependent quiescence of neural stem cells is associated with morphological and cytological changes to the support cells of their sub-ventricular zone  niche  <cit> . interestingly experimentally induced damage to the mouse svz stem cell niche is eventually repaired to produce a remodelled neural stem cell niche from svz progenitor cells  <cit> . cancer stem cells also modify their environments to induce a supportive niche. for example myeloproliferative neoplasia remodels the bone marrow niche to favour the growth of leukemic stem cells at the expense of normal hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . the induction of new cancer stem cell niche environments to support the formation of metastases has also been reported  <cit> . similarly in c.elegans, ectopic niches for gscs can be generated in the oviduct by mutations that lead to mis-expression of ligands for glp1/notch, which in c.elegans is activated in the gscs  <cit> . these studies suggest that niches may exhibit a degree of plasticity and that some cellular environments may act as nascent niches able to be recruited in response to appropriate signals. the reversible control of niche size that we have shown in the drosophila model highlights the possibility that similar niches in humans may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates a previously unexpected reversible plasticity of the well-studied gsc niche in the drosophila ovary in response to dietary nutrients, which we find associated with reversible changes in notch signalling. we further identified different capabilities of notch in cap and escort cells to maintain and replenish niche function and suggest gene expression changes rather than cell death and mitosis are responsible for the changes in niche size that we observe. interestingly we showed that there are spatially distinct target gene responses of notch activity in and around the adult niche with differential responses to dietary changes and adult age, reflected in changing robustness of the niche. further studies that identify the mechanisms regulating notch signalling will provide insights into how niche responses integrate these two systemic inputs.
