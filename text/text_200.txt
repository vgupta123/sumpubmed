BACKGROUND
activin a, a pleiotrophic cytokine belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta  superfamily, is synthesized by many cell types throughout the body  <cit> . the molecular structure is a disulphide-linked, homodimeric glycoprotein composed of two inhibin βa chains. activin a was first recognized as an endocrine factor, but is now known to be essential to developmental and repair processes, and total ablation is neonatal lethal  <cit> . contrasting regulatory roles have been cited for activin a in inflammation  <cit> . human monocytes synthesize activin a upon stimulation with classical m <dig> macrophage activation inducers such as gm-csf, lps, and ifnγ  <cit> . exposure of gm-csf treated macrophages to anti-activin a reduces m <dig> markers and enhances alternative m <dig> phenotype markers such as il- <dig>  <cit> . activin a also inhibits monocyte production of il-1β and enhances il- <dig> receptor antagonist production  <cit> . interestingly, in severe asthma, activin a may be elevated in serum, and data from animal models suggests that activin a may suppress t helper  <dig>  mediated allergic responses  <cit> . collectively these observations suggest multifunctional roles for activin a in inflammatory processes.

maintenance of lung homeostasis is a complex process dependent upon a network of interacting cells and cytokines. gm-csf is required for alveolar macrophage  function and pulmonary homeostasis  <cit> . in genetically altered mice homozygous for a disrupted gm-csf gene , hematopoiesis is normal but there is accumulation of excess lung surfactant  <cit> . this surfactant pathology mirrors that of human pap, an autoimmune disease characterized by high levels of autoantibody to gm-csf  <cit> . aerosolized gm-csf resolves the pulmonary pathology of gm-csf knockout mice, thus demonstrating that surfactant homeostasis can be influenced by local administration of gm-csf to the respiratory tract  <cit> .

previously we reported that healthy human ams synthesize activin a in response to gm-csf but ams of patients with pap are deficient in activin a  <cit> . in addition, pap ams are deficient in the nuclear transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, , a regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism that is restored by gm-csf treatment  <cit> . pparγ has also been shown to be a negative regulator of inflammation  <cit> . interestingly, alveolar macrophages of gm-csf knockout mice are also deficient in pparγ  <cit> . the role of activin a in the lung has not been established. because of the phenotypic similarities between human pap and the gm-csf knockout mouse, this study was undertaken to investigate activin a regulation in the lung. initially, it was hypothesized that activin a might be impaired in gm-csf knockout mice based upon previous data from pap studies  <cit> .

RESULTS
activin a and ifnγ are intrinsically elevated in gm-csf knockout mice as compared to wild-type mice
unlike previous findings of activin a deficiency in human pap  <cit> , activin a mrna expression of bal cells was significantly  elevated in gm-csf knockout mice compared to wild-type controls . quantification of activin a protein in bal fluids confirmed mrna findings with significantly  elevated protein levels in gm-csf knockout compared to wild-type . gm-csf knockout expression of follistatin, an inhibitor of activin a  <cit> , was similar to wild-type mice  and thus could not account for the striking elevation of activin a.

intrinsic factors that could potentially affect activin a levels were subsequently investigated in gm-csf knockout mice. macrophage colony-stimulating factor  has been reported to be upregulated in gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> . examination of m-csf in the current study, however, indicated no effect on activin a in vitro in either wild-type or gm-csf knockout ams . elevated ifnγ has been reported in lungs of gm-csf knockout mice  <cit>  therefore intrinsic levels of ifnγ were examined. ifnγ mrna expression was significantly  elevated in gm-csf knockout bal cells compared to wild-type controls . immunocytochemistry of gm-csf knockout bal cells confirmed mrna results and indicated markedly increased expression of intracellular ifnγ protein compared to wild-type .

ifnγ is not elevated in human pap bal cells
in contrast to results from gm-csf knockout mice, examination of ifnγ expression in human bal cells from pap patients revealed no significant increase compared to healthy controls .

activin a levels are enhanced by ifnγ and reduced by ifnγ blockade
ifnγ has been shown to upregulate activin a expression in human monocytes  <cit>  but ams have not been studied. results from 24-hour in vitro cultures of wild-type ams indicated that ifnγ  significantly  increased activin a expression . to determine whether blockade of ifnγ with specific anti-ifnγ antibody would alter intrinsic activin a expression, unstimulated gm-csf knockout ams were cultured in vitro for 24 hours with irrelevant immunoglobulin  or anti-ifnγ. elisa analysis of conditioned media indicated that anti-ifnγ reduced activin a protein synthesis compared to irrelevant ig  confirming that ifnγ blockade reduced intrinsic activin a production.

because activin a is intrinsically elevated in pparγ deficient gm-csf knockout mice but severely decreased in pparγ deficient human pap patients  <cit> , it appeared unlikely that pparγ would exert a direct effect on activin a. observations made elsewhere  <cit>  also found no evidence of a pparγ effect on activin a. we have shown, however, that ifnγ is elevated in macrophage-specific pparγ knockout mice and significantly reduced after in vivo restoration of pparγ via a lentivirus vector  <cit> . we utilized this approach to determine whether pparγ restoration in gm-csf knockout mice might reduce ifnγ and thereby reduce activin a. results supported this action. ten days post intratracheal inoculation of lentivirus reagents into gm-csf knockout mice, bal cell mrna expression of both ifnγ and activin a was significantly reduced in animals receiving lentivirus-pparγ compared to controls receiving lentivirus-egfp  .

human alveolar macrophage activin a is increased by ifnγ
while the above studies clearly defined ifnγ-mediated regulation of activin a in murine alveolar macrophages, it was necessary to confirm this pathway in human alveolar macrophages. in vitro studies demonstrated that ifnγ significantly enhanced activin a protein production  in healthy human alveolar macrophages. thus activin a synthesis in both human and murine alveolar macrophages is responsive to ifnγ upregulation even though intrinsic activin a levels differ between human and mouse.

gm-csf bal cells show intrinsic elevation of both m <dig> and m <dig> macrophage phenotypic markers
we and others reported previously that m-csf gene expression and protein, a cytokine associated with the m <dig> macrophage phenotype, was elevated in gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> . current data indicate that the m1-associated cytokine, ifnγ  is also increased in these mice. therefore, it was unclear whether gm-csf knockout bal cells would express predominantly m <dig> or m <dig> profiles. to address this issue, we determined mrna expression of several m <dig> and m <dig> markers in gm-csf knockout bal cells. with respect to m <dig> markers, we examined the ifnγ-regulated target gene, inos , together with ccl <dig> , and il- <dig> , and found that all were significantly elevated compared to wild-type mice. the m <dig> marker, il- <dig>  has been reported to be suppressed by elevated activin a  <cit> , and in pap, activin a deficiency is accompanied by elevated il- <dig>  <cit> . surprisingly, analysis of il- <dig> expression in gm-csf knockout bal cells revealed significantly elevated levels compared to wild-type mice . analysis of another m2-associated marker, ccl <dig>  also indicated significant elevation compared to wild-type mice . these results suggested that gm-csf knockout alveolar macrophages might constitute a mixed population of both m <dig> and m <dig> phenotypes.

discussion
the current findings suggest that ifnγ is a major contributory factor to the intrinsic elevation of activin a in ams. findings also point out a striking difference in activin a expression in human pap and gm-csf knockout mice despite common deficiencies of gm-csf and pparγ . in parallel with activin a, gm-csf knockout mice displayed over-expression of ifnγ  <cit> , a positive regulator of activin a  <cit> . in contrast, bal cells of pap patients do not exhibit elevated ifnγ and activin a is deficient  <cit> .

elevated ifnγ has been reported previously in the bal fluids of gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> . our previous studies also found elevated ifnγ expression in macrophage-specific pparγ knockout mice  <cit> . restoration of pparγ via lentivirus vector in these mice greatly diminished ifnγ expression  <cit> . in the current study, similar results were seen after pparγ–lentivirus treatment of gm-csf knockout mice. such findings suggest that the pparγ deficiency present in gm-csf knockout mice may contribute to elevated ifnγ. gm-csf has been shown to be a critical upregulator of pparγ  <cit> . the total lack of gm-csf in knockout mice may maintain an extreme pparγ deficiency which is ineffective at repressing inflammatory mediators such as ifnγ. in human pap, ifnγ levels are not increased despite pparγ deficiency, furthermore, gm-csf is not totally absent  <cit> . the primary etiology of pap is considered to be an autoimmune response to gm-csf in the form of high levels of circulating, neutralizing autoantibody to gm-csf  <cit> . it is also possible that additional regulatory mechanisms are present in human lung to help prevent ifnγ buildup in pap.

the varying characteristics of activated macrophages have led to attempts to categorize activation phenotypes  <cit> . the m <dig> phenotype is characterized by production of microbial or ifnγ-triggered molecules such as inos and il- <dig>  gm-csf has been cited as an inducer of m <dig> phenotypes while m-csf has been shown to induce the m <dig> alternative activation phenotype in which il- <dig> or tgfβ may be produced  <cit> . we have shown that m-csf is elevated in gm-csf knockout mice  <cit>  and in human pap  <cit>  which might suggest the presence of an m <dig> macrophage phenotype . interestingly, pparγ, which is deficient in gm-csf knockout mice, is also a major driver of the m <dig> phenotype  <cit> . it has been pointed out however, that macrophage phenotypes were defined by carefully controlled in vitro conditions which may be vastly different from the in vivo milieu  <cit> . thus the juxtaposition of both ifnγ and m-csf in the lungs of gm-csf knockout mice could produce the novel combination of macrophage activation phenotypes illustrated by elevated m <dig>  and m <dig>  markers . other ifnγ-inducible pro-inflammatory mediators  have been noted in the lungs of gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> . previously, we found that mmp- <dig>  a matrix metalloproteinase associated with m-csf and alternative m <dig> activation, is also elevated in gm-csf knockout bal cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the current findings extend our previous studies examining pulmonary mechanisms operative in human pap and the gm-csf knockout mouse. it is clear that pathways of activin a regulation may utilize gm-csf or ifnγ as stimulatory factors. in the gm-csf knockout mouse, lack of gm-csf may restrict production of sufficient pparγ to control inflammation. the persistent elevation of both m-csf and ifnγ may influence ams to express characteristics of both m <dig> and m <dig> phenotypes. the current data emphasize the plasticity of alveolar macrophages in assuming a unique activation phenotype when regulatory pathways become dysfunctional.
