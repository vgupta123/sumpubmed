BACKGROUND
molecular markers are the foundation of modern molecular plant breeding. there are many types of molecular markers such as restriction fragment length polymorphism , simple sequence repeat  and snps. in cotton which is the world most important natural fiber crop, the most prevalent marker type as of today is ssr. however, with the advent of next generation sequencing technologies that significantly reduce sequencing cost, snp markers are becoming more and more important due to their abundance in the genome and very simple genetic mode .

cotton researchers have tried different methods to develop snp markers. an et al.  <cit>  reported a few snp markers when studying r2r3-myb transcription factors. in  <dig>  van deynze  <cit>  reported the first large-scale snp discovery results in cotton. they developed about  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels by re-sequencing the ests of  <dig> upland cotton genotypes. about  <dig> of these snps were also mapped in the tm-1 × 3- <dig> genetic map  <cit> . recently, research in cotton snp discovery has been accelerated and many snp markers have been reported  <cit> . in spite of this, the number of cotton snp markers is still low as compared with other major crops such as maize or soybean. more importantly, a great majority of these snp markers have neither been validated in other genotypes nor mapped.

due to its allotetraploid nature, it has been a challenge to differentiate a true snp  from a pseudo-snp  in cotton snp marker development. in  <dig>  trick et al.  <cit>  developed many snp markers in brassica napus that is also an allotetraploid using transcriptome sequencing. this study provided some insights that could be useful in the development of cotton snp markers.

direct sequencing has been a standard method to develop snp markers, although its efficiency is low, especially in plants with complex genomes  <cit> . another alternative is to take advantage of the large amount of sequence data available in public databases to develop snp and indel markers using bioinformatics  <cit> .

expressed sequence tags  have been mined for large-scale snp discovery in plants including arabidopsis
 <cit> , barley  <cit> , maize  <cit> , sugarcane  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and cotton  <cit> . snps mined from ests have the potential to be functional markers if the particular est or gene is responsible for phenotypic variations  <cit> . several methods for identifying snps from ests have been reported  <cit> , and numerous cotton ests are available in public databases  <cit> , providing important foundations for the development of est-based cotton snp markers.

the 3′ untranslated regions  undergo less selective pressure than the coding sequences   <cit> , resulting in a higher rate of sequence variation than the cdss. thus, 3′utrs have become valuable resources in identifying snps or indels, especially in those species with duplicate genomes  <cit> . koepke et al.  <cit>  developed indel markers by focusing on the 3′utrs of the rna-seq data in sweet cherry.

in the present study, cotton snp and indel markers were developed using four strategies. first, interspecific est-snps were developed by comparing the ests between g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. second, intraspecific est-snps were developed by mining the unigenes of g. hirsutum. third, est-indels were developed by mining the 3′utrs of public g. hirsutum sequences. and fourth, indel markers were developed by blasting putative 3′utrs of g. hirsutum against the 3′utrs of arabidopsis. subsequently, we used sscp technology to validate these markers, and analyzed their polymorphisms between the two mapping parents. polymorphic markers were used to genotype our bc <dig> mapping population  <cit>  and mapped. snp and indel markers developed in this report will be a valuable genomic resource for cotton genetics and breeding research.

RESULTS
in silicoanalysis and primer design
interspecific est-snp markers
the collected  <dig>  g. hirsutum ests and  <dig>  g. barbadense ests were clustered into  <dig>  clusters, which were then imported into haplosnper  to identify the interspecific snps. of the  <dig>  clusters,  <dig>   had no snps,  <dig>  had only inter-homoeologous snps,  <dig>  had inter/hemi-snps, and  <dig>   had hemi-snps. only the clusters containing inter/hemi-snps or hemi-snps were used to design primers to detect interspecific snps .

among the  <dig> clusters containing inter/hemi-snps, the number of clusters containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and ≥ <dig> sequences was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. five clusters were removed due to failing to meet the stringent criteria described in the ‘methods’. among the remaining  <dig> clusters, the number of clusters containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and ≥ <dig> sequences were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. eventually,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> inter/hemi-snps, and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hemi-snps were developed, respectively . detailed information of the markers, sequence accession numbers and sequences used to design primers, and snps of  <dig> inter/hemi-snps and  <dig> hemi-snps are listed in the additional file  <dig> 

to those  <dig>  clusters containing only hemi-snps, the same classification analysis was conducted. after selection of the same stringent criteria, only  <dig>  clusters were kept for snp marker design. finally, a total of  <dig> hemi-snps were developed .

intraspecific est-snp markers
there were a total of  <dig>  unigenes available from ncbi  in july  <dig> when this research was initiated, derived from more than  <dig> cotton genotypes. after removing  <dig>  unigenes containing less than  <dig> sequences, the remaining  <dig>  unigenes were downloaded from ncbi, and the  <dig>  unigenes containing sequences originating from the same genotype were further removed. as a result,  <dig>  unigenes were imported into haplosnper to identify est-snps. the results showed that  <dig>  unigenes did not contain snps, while  <dig>  unigenes contained snps.

the  <dig>  unigenes were first classified according to the previously mentioned standards. then the unigenes containing only putative snps were removed, and only  <dig>  unigenes containing reliable snps were kept for primer design. finally,  <dig> intraspecific est-snp markers were designed . in general, one primer pair was developed from each unigene. however, ideal primer pair could not be designed from some unigenes; and two or more primer pairs were designed from the unigenes containing some distant snps to amplify more possible snps.

indel markers of g. hirsutum
a total of  <dig>  g. hirsutum nucleiotide sequences were evaluated for possible indel marker development, and  <dig>  sequences with complete cdss were selected. among these sequences,  <dig> had 3′utr sequences longer than 100 bp. after removing redundancy,  <dig> unique sequences were eligible to develop indel markers. in total,  <dig> hau-indel-prefixed markers were developed .

three sets of g. hirsutum sequences, including  <dig>  genome survey sequences ,  <dig>  nucleotides sequences and  <dig>  mrnas were used to blast against the  <dig>  3′utrs of arabidopsis sequences. according to the criteria described in the ‘methods’,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences were homologous to the 3’utrs of arabidopsis sequences including  <dig> singlets and  <dig> contigs. subsequently, another  <dig> hau-indel-prefixed markers were developed .

polymorphisms of the snp and indel markers
all the  <dig>  snp and indel markers described above were analyzed for their polymorphisms between g. hirsutum cv. emian <dig> and g. barbadense acc. 3– <dig> using sscp method. as a result,  <dig>  primer pairs were polymorphic, and produced  <dig> loci .table  <dig>

among the  <dig> interspecific est-snp primer pairs,  <dig>  pairs were polymorphic, and revealed  <dig> loci, including  <dig> inter/hemi-snps and  <dig> hemi-snps . the  <dig> polymorphic inter/hemi-snps were screened out of  <dig> primer pairs, with a polymorphic rate of  <dig> %. and the  <dig> polymorphic hemi-snps were selected from  <dig> primer pairs, with a polymorphic rate of  <dig> %. sscp analysis revealed  <dig>  polymorphic markers out of the total  <dig> intraspecific est-snp primer pairs, producing  <dig> loci . as for the polymorphisms of the indel markers,  <dig> were polymorphic, and revealed  <dig> loci. more specifically, of the total  <dig> indel markers designed through g. hirsutum mrnas,  <dig>  were polymorphic, and produced  <dig> loci . among the total  <dig> indel markers developed from blast analysis against arabidopsis 3′utrs,  <dig>  were polymorphic, and produced  <dig> loci .

distribution of snp and indel markers on the interspecific bc <dig> linkage map
after linkage analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> snp and indel polymorphic loci were mapped on the  <dig> cotton chromosomes. sixty-six loci were mapped on the  <dig> chromosomes of the at genome, which included  <dig>  loci with a total genetic distance of  <dig> .27 cm and an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. sixty-seven loci were mapped on the  <dig> chromosomes of the dt genome, which included  <dig>  loci with a total genetic distance of  <dig> .24 cm and an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. the present interspecific linkage map contains  <dig>  loci with a total genetic distance of  <dig> .51 cm and an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm . although the  <dig> snp and indel markers were mapped on all  <dig> chromosomes, they were not evenly distributed. chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig> had more loci, while chr <dig> and chr <dig> had fewer loci .table  <dig>

statistical analysis of base variations and snp frequency of cotton genes
statistical analysis of reliable base variations showed that the snps in different clusters/unigenes that were used to design hau-snp-prefixed markers had the same tendency towards more base transitions  . specifically, the percentage of a certain base variation varied from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  in the clusters used to design the interspecific est-snp markers, and from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  in the unigenes used to design the intraspecific est-snp markers . in total, the percentage varied from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  in this study, with base transitions  accounting for  <dig> % of the total snps .table  <dig> 
summary of cotton base variations




in order to gain more understanding about the relationship between snps and gene functions, we conducted functional annotation analyses of the consensus sequences. the number of snps/gene involved in cellular component, molecular function and biological process was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively for those clusters used to design interspecific est-snp markers. in the unigenes used to design the intraspecific est-snp markers, a similar analysis showed that the number of snps/gene in cellular component, molecular function and biological process was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in total, the highest number of snps/gene was in the cellular component category , followed by the molecular function  and biological process  categories .table  <dig>

go analysis of the total  <dig> consensus sequences on level  <dig> showed that  <dig> sequences were assigned to  <dig> functions in the ‘cellular component’ category,  <dig> were assigned to  <dig> functions in the ‘molecular function’ category, and  <dig> were assigned to  <dig> functions in the ‘biological process’ category . among these functions, genes belonging to ‘killing of cells of other organism’ had the maximum snps/gene ; while, genes belonging to ‘selenium binding’, ‘circadian rhythm’, etc. harbored the minimum snps/gene  .

confirmation of the predicted snps
to validate the snps predicted by in silico analysis, the pcr products generated from three polymorphic primer pairs were randomly chosen to be cloned and sanger-sequenced. the results showed that the product sizes of two markers  were not different between emian <dig>  3– <dig> and the original sequences, but those of marker hau-snp <dig> were slightly different between them .figure  <dig>

in silico analysis predicted several snps in the amplified products of the marker hau-snp <dig>  including base transitions at the 88th and 93rd bases, and a series of base variations starting at the 161st base. however, sequence analysis of the two mapping parents differed from the predicted results. two base transitions appeared at the 61st base  and the 80th base . the interspecific differences in the end of the amplified sequences appeared at the 163rd and 164th bases  .

the three predicted interspecific snps in marker hau-snp <dig> included base transitions at the 112nd and 118th bases, and a base transversion at the 148th base. these snps were confirmed by the two mapping parents without any discrepancy .

only one snp was predicted in the amplified products of the marker hau-snp <dig>  which was a transition at the 62nd base . however, both emian <dig> and 3– <dig> contained t at the 62nd base, while the difference between the two parents appeared at the 183rd base . besides the base transitions at the 62nd and 183rd bases, there was no difference among the four sequences .

discussion
reliability of snps contained in clusters/unigenes
the in silico analysis of clusters used to design the interspecific est-snps showed that, among the  <dig> clusters containing inter/hemi-snps,  <dig>  contained reliable snps. this value increased with the number of sequences contained in the clusters increased . similar trend was observed in the  <dig>  clusters containing hemi-snps though the number of reliable snps was smaller . the reason behind this might be that most of the clusters containing hemi-snps had fewer g. barbadense sequences while more g. barbadense sequences existed for those containing inter/hemi-snps.

in silico analysis of unigenes used to design the intraspecific est-snps showed that, only  <dig>  of the total  <dig>  unigenes containing putative snps harbored reliable snps. this number further decreased with the increasing number of sequences contained in the unigenes, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . this might be partially due to different sequences of the same genotype submitted by different researchers, along with the increase of the total number of sequences contained in the unigenes that demands more rigorous comparison.

polymorphism comparison of snp and indel markers
the polymorphic rate of the intraspecific est-snp markers  was relatively low, which is consistent with the fact that markers derived from coding sequences have a lower polymorphism due to their more conserved nature compared to non-coding sequences  <cit> . the interspecific est-snp markers had the highest polymorphic rate , which is mainly due to the focused attention on the interspecific differences while developing markers  <cit> . although various polymorphic rates of markers among the subclasses existed in the both categories, the polymorphic rate of inter/hemi-snps  was much higher than that of hemi-snps .

compared to the intraspecific est-snp markers, the first batch of hau-indel-prefixed markers had a higher polymorphic rate , which is consistent with the results obtained by zhu et al.  <cit> . however, the second batch of hau-indel-prefixed markers showed the lowest polymorphic rate . generally, this is a possible but unsatisfactory method to develop cotton markers by comparing with arabidopsis sequences. application of this method might result in inaccurate information. this inaccuracy may be overcome when tetraploid cotton genome sequence becomes available. in summary, appropriate methods of marker development, either through improving the reliability of predicted snps or targeting regions possessing more variations, are necessary to increase polymorphic rates.

even distribution of snp and indel markers on the interspecific bc <dig> linkage map
no obvious difference was observed in the number of snp/indel loci mapped between the at and dt sub-genomes. however, uneven distribution was present among chromosomes. within a chromosome, the snp/indel loci were relatively evenly distributed . the results are consistent with the fact that base substitutions exist throughout the cotton genome  <cit> .

transition preference and snp frequency of cotton genes
statistical analysis of the cotton base variations showed that base transitions appeared more frequently than other base variations, consistent with previous reports of the preference for base transitions  <cit> . specifically, base transitions accounted for  <dig> % of all the reliable snps in this study, which may be due to methylated cytosines in cpg dinucleotides changed into thymines during the genesis of the snps  <cit> .

snp frequency of cotton genes on level  <dig> showed that snps/gene decreased gradually in the order of cellular component category, molecular function category and biological process category . on level  <dig>  snp frequency in each gene varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  among genes with different functions . these results could provide directions to the research on snp effects on gene functions.

advantages and disadvantages of developing est-snp/indel markers
with the availability of large number of ests and the release of plant genomes, a large number of snps/indels in various plants have been discovered using bioinformatics  <cit> , indicating that bioinformatics is an efficient tool to discover snps/indels. in this study, however, there were some differences between the predicted results and the sequencing results . the materials used for sequencing in our study are different from those materials for predicting snps/indels, which may account for the differences observed. additionally, the deviation between bioinformatics and experiments partly explained why these markers had such low polymorphism in this study. in conclusion, direct sequencing of the mapping parents may be the best way to develop highly reliable and polymorphic snp/indel markers.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig>  snp/indel markers were developed from a large number of ests. of them,  <dig> markers  were polymorphic between two mapping parents and revealed  <dig> polymorphic loci based on the sscp analysis. although the marker discovery efficiency and marker polymorphism were relatively low, linkage analysis mapped  <dig> loci on the  <dig> chromosomes, indicating that est-based snps and indels developed by in silico analysis are useful in tetraploid cotton genetic mapping. in addition, this study also revealed the preference of base transitions over other types of base variations and different snp frequencies contained in cotton genes. sanger sequencing showed certain discrepancy between the in silico sequence prediction and the actual sequences. in general, the in silico analysis is a complementary but of low efficiency method to develop snps and indels in cotton, indicating that resequencing or high-throughput sequencing may be a better way to develop cotton snps/indels.
