BACKGROUND
research efforts are currently underway in order to better understand the host-microbe interactions that occur in the human gastrointestinal  tract  <cit> . evidence suggests that the upset of the gi microflora balance underlies many diseases and that therapies often start with the restoration of a healthy balance  <cit> . in this respect, probiotics  are gaining widespread recognition as new prevention strategies or therapies for multiple gi diseases  <cit> .

lactic acid bacteria  are indigenous inhabitants of the human gi tract  <cit> . they also have a long history of traditional use in many industrial and artisanal plant, meat, and dairy fermentations. based on their putative or proven health-promoting effects, these bacteria are commonly marketed as probiotics  <cit> . some lab strains have clearly been shown to exert beneficial health effects  <cit> . however, these effects are known to be strain specific  <cit> , and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood  <cit> . the level of evidence provided varies greatly depending on studies, and effects associated with most of the marketed products remain unsubstantiated. current legislations agree to call for scientific substantiation of health claims associated with foods, mainly through well-designed human intervention clinical studies  <cit> . therefore, scientific evidence that would help understand the mechanisms behind the activities of probiotics and narrow down the expensive and time-consuming clinical trials to strains that stand the best chance of success are of great interest. such evidence may include data from epidemiological studies, from in vivo and in vitro trials, as well as from mechanistic, genomic and proteomic studies.

proteomics plays a pivotal role in linking the genome and the transcriptome to potential biological functions. as far as probiotics are concerned, comparative proteomics can be used in the identification of proteins and proteomic patterns that may one day serve as bacterial biomarkers for probiotic features  <cit> . comparison of differentially expressed proteins within the same strain in different conditions have been performed, shedding light on bacterial adaptation factors to gi tract conditions, such as bile  <cit> , acidic ph  <cit> , and adhesion to the gut mucosa  <cit> . on the other hand, 2-de coupled with mass spectrometry  has been used to analyze bacterial protein polymorphisms and to distinguish between closely related pathogenic organisms  <cit> , but this approach has rarely been employed to compare strains based on their probiotic features. we previously reported the first study of this kind which highlighted key proteins involved in the adhesion properties of lactobacillus plantarum to mucin  <cit> . recently, hydrophobicity and cell agglutination properties in bifidobacterium longum were investigated through the protein patterns of four strains  <cit> . both studies focused on cell surface properties related to adhesion. to our knowledge, proteomics has not been used to compare intra-species strains as regards other gi tract adaptation factors.

yet, the ability to survive exposure to bile is one of the commonly used criteria to select potential probiotic strains, since bile is a major challenge for bacteria entering the gi tract  <cit> . in addition to affecting membrane characteristics, bile has numerous other effects on bacterial cells including detergent action, dna damage, acid, oxidative and osmotic stresses  <cit> . thus, when it comes to the study of bile stress, the overall bile, oxidative, acid, detergent and salt  stresses should be taken into account. although mechanisms of survival to bile stress are not fully understood, several genes and molecules involved in this process have been indentified in lactobacilli  <cit> .

the latter remain the most prominent group of probiotic bacteria, despite the increasing use of other genera such as bifidobacteria. widely studied with regard to numerous properties, they represent a suitable bacterial model. among the most common species, l. plantarum is part of a number of ethnic as well as commercial probiotic preparations where it has a long history of safe use  <cit> . in addition, it is an important member of the gi tract microbiota and is a flexible and versatile species with one of the largest genomes known within lab  <cit> .

the present paper investigates the natural protein diversity within the l. plantarum species with relation to bile tolerance and subsequent ability to resist gi tract conditions. this investigation is based on the study of the proteomic profiles of three l. plantarum strains selected according to their in vitro bile tolerance properties.

RESULTS
in this study, three strains showing different levels of bile tolerance ability in vitro were chosen out of nine l. plantarum subsp. plantarum cultures . the selected strains were cultured in non-stressing conditions so as to investigate their inherent proteome differences, with a specific focus on proteins that may play a role in bile tolerance processes. in addition, changes in protein expression during bile salt exposure were analyzed in order to assess the effective involvement of the proteins of interest in the bile stress response of the three strains.

bile salt tolerance
l. plantarum strains were exposed to bile stress using increasing oxgall concentrations. the effects of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % oxgall  on the maximum growth rates were investigated . two-way analysis of variance  revealed significant effects of both the bile concentration and the strain . a stepwise increase in the oxgall concentration resulted in a gradual decrease in the maximal growth rate for all strains except l. plantarum cect 748t and cect  <dig> . strains could be assigned to three groups according to their bile sensitivity. l. plantarum  <dig> v and lc  <dig> showed the best ability to grow in oxgall-supplemented culture broth with relative growth rates that ranged from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, as compared to standard conditions. l. plantarum lc  <dig> was the most sensitive strain to bile salts, with relative growth rates from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. the six other strains tested were moderately bile tolerant and had relative growth rates in the range of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. l. plantarum lc  <dig> , l. plantarum lc  <dig>  and l. plantarum  <dig> v  were used for comparative proteomic analysis in standard conditions and following bile salt exposure.

comparative proteomic analysis of l. plantarum strains in standard growth conditions
l. plantarum lc  <dig>  lc  <dig> and  <dig> v were cultured under non-stressing conditions and cell proteins were extracted. protein loads of  <dig> μg representing total proteomes of each of the three strains were separated by 2-de. three independent biological replicates were carried out per strain. figure  <dig> shows representative 2-de patterns for the three strains when cultured in standard conditions. inter-strain discrepancies between inherent proteomic patterns were investigated with regard to the different bile tolerance abilities of the strains, so as to pinpoint proteins that may be implicated in the bile tolerance process.

although the overall inherent protein patterns of the three l. plantarum strains were similar,  <dig> out of an average of  <dig> detected protein spots displayed different abundance levels in standard conditions . the corresponding gel spots were excised and subjected to tryptic digestion followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  analysis and proteomic database search using phenyx and omssa to elucidate their identity and likely function. proteins in a total of  <dig> spots were identified, some of which were found in more than one spot, indicating the presence of protein isoforms. proteins fell into  <dig> functional categories, covering most of the biochemical functions encountered in bacterial cells. sequence alignment analysis focused on the three sequenced l. plantarum strains wcfs <dig>  jdm <dig> and atcc  <dig> revealed a systematic occurrence of the corresponding genes with high levels of similarity .

among the proteins with differential abundance levels between strains that were identified in non-stressing conditions,  <dig> have previously been reported to be involved in boads stress tolerance processes :  five proteins , spot 1; bile salt hydrolase  <dig> , spot 11; glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase , spot 26; groel chaperonin , spot 76; f0f <dig> atp synthase subunit δ , spot 90) were exclusively detected or significantly more abundant  in the resistant strain ;  three proteins , spot 18; glutathione reductase  <dig> , spot 24; and atp-dependent clp protease proteolytic subunit, spot 77) were present at the same level in both resistant and intermediate strains , but not observed in the sensitive strain ;  two proteins , spot 4; and bifunctional gmp synthase , spot 80) were present solely or to a higher extent in the intermediate strain;  one protein , spot 19) showed the same expression level in the resistant and sensitive strains, while it was barely detected in the intermediate strain;  two proteins , spots  <dig> and 41; cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase , spots  <dig> and 72) displayed different expression levels between strains depending on the considered isoform; and  two proteins , spot 42; and ribosomal protein s30ea, spot 62) were only detected in the sensitive strain. these  <dig> proteins belonged to  <dig> functional categories, including cell membrane biogenesis, molecular transport, energy metabolism, as well as chaperone activity.

bile influence on expression levels of proteins reportedly involved in bile tolerance
cells were cultured in stressing conditions using  <dig> % oxgall for  <dig> h ,  <dig> h  and  <dig> h , which allowed the harvesting of all cells at the early-stationary phase, as in non-stimulating conditions . as protein expression is growth-phase dependent, having cells in a comparable physiological state was in fact key in this investigation. analysis of changes in protein expression during bile salt exposure was focused on the  <dig> proteins previously reported to play a role in boads stress tolerance. figure  <dig> illustrates representative 2-de patterns for the three strains when cultured with  <dig> % oxgall. while these patterns looked similar to each other, they were quite different from those obtained in standard conditions, suggesting quantitative changes for most of the protein spots observed. table  <dig> reports changes in spot intensities between standard and bile stress conditions for the  <dig> proteins of interest in this study. thirteen out of the  <dig> proteins linked to boads stress tolerance in previous studies appeared to respond to the presence of bile , suggesting a direct involvement of these proteins in the bile tolerance process of the studied l. plantarum strains. these proteins could be divided into three groups. three proteins showed higher expression levels in stressing conditions: hsp <dig>  spot  <dig> ; hsp <dig>  spot  <dig> ; and clpp, spot  <dig> . conversely, two other proteins were repressed when challenged with oxgall: bsh <dig>  spot  <dig> ; and ribosomal protein s30ea, spot  <dig> . the third group includes eight proteins with modifications in expression levels that depended on strains  or resulted in a different expression of protein isoforms . the expression levels of two proteins  however were not impacted following exposure to  <dig> % oxgall , suggesting a minor role for these in the bile tolerance process of the considered l. plantarum strains.

discussion
this paper reports the application of 2-de and ms analysis to investigate lab proteins that are key in the bile tolerance process, a major factor when it comes to probiotics adaptation to the gi tract. although 2-de has known limitations and only explores part of bacterial proteomes as compared to other gel-less analyses  <cit> , it is a widely used and affordable technique which proved to be valuable in discriminating strains according to their bacterial features  <cit> . with regard to probiotic research, two previous studies used a similar approach to explore adhesion properties of l. plantarum  <cit>  and b. longum  <cit> . however, this is the first time that an attempt is made towards getting a broad picture of bile tolerance at the species level rather than focusing on a single strain.

l. plantarum, a versatile species with marketed probiotic strains, was chosen as a model for this study. an in vitro test was used to assess bile tolerance of nine strains, including l. plantarum  <dig> v, a probiotic with outstanding bile resistance properties  <cit> . these properties were confirmed in our study, as this strain showed the best ability to grow in bile supplemented culture broths. considerable variations in growth rates were observed between strains, with the highest effect of bile on l. plantarum lc  <dig>  which is in accordance with previous reports showing a strain-specific behavior of lab with regard to bile tolerance  <cit> . strains lc  <dig> , lc  <dig>  and  <dig> v  were selected for the proteomic investigation. for that purpose, we focused on the whole cell proteomes, since the ability of an organism to tolerate bile may require a wide array of proteins implicated in either membrane- or cytosol-based functions and mechanisms  <cit> .

the differentially expressed proteins among the three selected strains cultured in standard conditions all appeared to be encoded by highly conserved genes in the l. plantarum species. these core-genome proteins are of great interest in the search for bacterial biomarkers as their relative abundance is likely to be assessed for any l. plantarum strain. in our case,  <dig> proteins displayed increasing levels of expression from the sensitive strain  to the resistant one , suggesting a positive correlation of these proteins with bile resistance. conversely,  <dig> proteins showed decreasing levels of expression as the considered strain was more tolerant to bile, indicating a link with bile sensitivity. therefore, these proteins might represent potential biomarker candidates of bile tolerance in l. plantarum and should be further studied, especially the ones with unknown functions .

particular interest was in differentially expressed proteins with a reported putative involvement, not specifically in bile tolerance, but in the overall boads stress tolerance, since the deleterious effects of bile not only include a detergent action, but also low-ph, oxidative and osmotic stresses  <cit> . this led to the identification of  <dig> proteins likely to be implicated in bile tolerance of the selected strains. two of these proteins  have previously been negatively correlated to constitutive acid  <cit>  and bile  <cit>  tolerance, respectively, suggesting they could impart bacterial sensitivity to theses stress factors. interestingly, they were not detected  or naturally underexpressed  in the resistant strain. on the other hand, the  <dig> remaining proteins have been linked to boads stress resistance in previous studies. ten of them were overexpressed in the resistant or intermediate strains, while only one of them displayed higher expression levels in the bile sensitive strain. these results showed that the natural protein diversity observed among l. plantarum strains cultured in standard conditions can reflect their ability to tolerate bile. the more resistant a strain is to bile, the more it naturally expresses proteins that can help in the bile resistance process, but also the less it produces proteins that may impart sensitivity to this stress. these proteins could therefore constitute an inherent and characteristic proteomic profile that is indicative of bile tolerance.

to confirm the putative involvement of the  <dig> proteins of interest in the bile tolerance process and get an overview on how bile salts affect their levels of expression, proteomic analysis of strains response to bile exposure was performed. thirteen proteins appeared to be directly implicated in bile stress adaptation, since their expression was significantly affected by exposure to bile salt . five of them  are general stress-response proteins involved in repair and protection of proteins and dna. they were up-regulated in response to bile challenge, which is in accordance with previous findings  <cit> . this set of proteins intervenes in numerous stress-management response systems, suggesting they have unspecific contributions to bile stress tolerance, which may result in multifaceted stress-dependent mechanisms of action, as this was recently reviewed for dps  <cit> . two other proteins  are part of regulatory systems modulating protein translation during environmental stresses. guaa, involved in guanine nucleotide metabolism, indirectly governs intracellular gtp level responsible for translation efficiency  <cit> , while ribosomal protein s30ea limits protein synthesis by reducing translation initiation  <cit> . both proteins were down-regulated in the sensitive strain following bile exposure, which is consistent with previous studies  <cit> . all in all,  <dig> out of the  <dig> proteins directly involved in bile tolerance of the three-selected l. plantarum strains were not dedicated to one of the damaging effects of bile, but covered a wide range of environmental stresses instead.

in contrast, other factors contribute in a specific way to bile tolerance. this is the case of gshr <dig> and gshr <dig> which help protect the cell against oxidative injury  <cit> . this coincides with the lower global levels of glutathione reductases in the sensitive strain in both standard and stimulating conditions found in our study. another protein, the cfa <dig>  catalyzes the cyclopropane ring formation in phospholipid biosynthesis, which may help maintain integrity of the cell envelope. in escherichia coli, the cytoplasmic membrane of a cfa-mutant displayed increased overall permeability to protons compared to the native strain  <cit> . this could for instance explain the higher acid sensitivity of a cfa-mutant of l. acidophilus ncfm  <cit> . in our study, a cfa <dig> isoform was absent in the sensitive strain, while another isoform was not detected in the resistant one, suggesting different functional properties of the isoforms with regard to bile tolerance.

another specific mechanism of bile adaptation is the active removal of bile-related stress factors. such is the case of the f0f1-atp synthases which facilitate the extrusion of protons from the cytoplasm by proton motive force  <cit> . previous findings reported that a bile-adapted b. animalis strain was able to tolerate bile by inducing proton pumping by a f0f1-atp synthase, therefore tightly regulating the internal ph  <cit> . in our study, a representative f0f1-atp synthase, atph, was absent in the weak strain and was up-regulated in the intermediate strain, which is consistent with the up-regulation of the corresponding gene reported for l. plantarum wcfs <dig> when exposed to porcine bile  <cit> . abc transporters are also a major part of the efflux systems involved in the transport of harmful-compounds and cell detoxification  <cit> . a representative abc transporter, opua, was more abundant in the resistant strain, less abundant in the intermediate one, and not detected in the sensitive one. this protein is known to be implied in the l. plantarum response to osmotic stress, one of the numerous deleterious effects of bile  <cit> . in addition, deletion of an opua gene in listeria monocytogenes was shown to significantly increase bacterial sensitivity to physiological concentrations of human bile  <cit> . this protein is therefore likely to be a key determinant of the high bile resistance of strain  <dig> v.

when it comes to bile tolerance, bsh is probably what first comes to mind, since it involves the direct hydrolysis of bile salts. although the ecological significance of microbial bsh activity is not yet fully understood, the suggestion was made that it may play a major detoxification role  <cit> . l. plantarum strains carry four bsh genes . bsh <dig>  bsh <dig> and bsh <dig> are highly conserved among l. plantarum species, while bsh <dig> is not and seems to be the major determinant of the global bsh activity of l. plantarum strains. besides, a bsh1-mutant of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> displayed a decreased tolerance to glycine-conjugated bile salts  <cit> . in our study, a bsh <dig> homologue could only be found in the most resistant strain in standard conditions, but its amount decreased following the strain's exposure to bile. this result contrasts with the bsh <dig> gene up-regulation in l. plantarum wcfs <dig> following bile challenge  <cit> . strains from l. acidophilus and l. salivarius on the other hand did not seem to up-regulate their bsh <dig> production following bile exposure  <cit> . such discrepancy in regulation trends of bsh genes suggests that, depending on the considered strains and species, bsh activity may or may not be a major determinant of bile resistance.

finally, it appeared that the six bile tolerance factors described above may contribute in various ways to the bile tolerance of l. plantarum strains. in particular, strains appeared to regulate key proteins differently following exposure to bile, which suggests that several strategies coexist in the bile adaptation process of l. plantarum species, some strains favoring certain specific pathways, while others downplaying them.

CONCLUSIONS
this work used comparative and functional proteomics to analyze cell-free protein extracts from three l. plantarum strains with different bile resistance properties. this approach showed that the natural protein diversity among l. plantarum strains cultured in standard conditions can reflect their ability to tolerate bile. the results provided an overview of proteomic patterns related to bile tolerance, and showed a clear effect of bile salts on the level of expression of certain proteins within these patterns. particularly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> proteins of interest were shown to be directly involved in the bile tolerance of l. plantarum, six of which could be part of specific bile adaptation pathways, including protection against oxidative stress , maintenance of cell envelope integrity , and active removal of bile-related stress factors . also, analysis of changes in protein expression gave insight into the way the different strains use these pathways for their survival, suggesting complex, strain-specific and probably conflicting molecular mechanisms in the cell's adaptation strategy to bile.

finally, this study showed that comparative proteomic analysis can help understand the differential bacterial properties of lab. in the field of probiotic studies, characteristic proteomic profiles can be identified for individual properties which may serve as bacterial biomarkers for the preliminary selection of strains with the best probiotic potential. this would certainly increase the chances of success of clinical trials through a more focused approach.
