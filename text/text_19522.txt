BACKGROUND
smooth muscle protein of 22kda  was one of three protein isoforms  first purified from chicken gizzard muscle but with no known function  <cit> . several years later sm <dig> was rediscovered and named transgelin due to its apparent ability to induce gelation of actin filaments in vitro  <cit>  however subsequent analysis revealed that sm <dig> and transgelin were one and the same protein  <cit> . these and subsequent analyses have identified a family of related proteins variously known as mp <dig>  np <dig>  np <dig>  p <dig>  sm22α, sm22β, transgelin and ws3- <dig> . following the sequencing of various vertebrate genomes, it is now recognized that all these proteins arise from just three genes named tagln1- <dig>  with sm22α, transgelin and ws3- <dig> being independently discovered, but identical products of the tagln <dig> gene, sm22β the product of tagln <dig> and the neuronally expressed np <dig> and np <dig> the product of tagln <dig>  sm <dig> is a member of the calponin family of proteins  <cit>  all of which comprise an amino-terminal calponin homology  domain and from one  to three  short motifs know as calponin or clik <dig> repeats  <cit> . all family members are actin binding and under some circumstances actin bundling proteins. despite the presence of a ch domain, actin binding is not mediated by the ch domain  <cit>  but through sequences between the ch domain and the first calponin repeat and within the calponin repeats themselves . sm <dig> orthologues in invertebrates have also been described including mp <dig> in drosophila and scp1p in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . unlike the situation in vertebrates with three tagln genes, in s. cerevisiae scp1p is the sole sm22/transgelin representative. studies on scp <dig> have shown that deletion of scp <dig> enhances cell longevity through an increase in f-actin turnover and a drop in levels of cell reactive oxygen species. conversely, increased levels of scp <dig> led to decreased actin dynamics, an increase in cellular levels of reactive oxygen species and increased cell death  <cit> . in addition, it has been observed that sm <dig> levels are elevated in senescent mammalian cells suggesting that the role of the interaction characterized between scp <dig> and actin in yeast may play a similar role in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . we therefore investigated the relationship between sm22/transgelin and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell migration and response to stress in fibroblast and prostate cancer cell lines.

RESULTS
expression of sm22/transgelin family products in cell lines
most vertebrate genomes contain  <dig> tagln genes and many tissues and cells express more than one gene. in order to examine the function of single tagln gene products and to increase the chances of being able to deplete all tagln gene products in a given cell, we made an initial screen of cell lines from different tissue sources in order to determine what complement of tagln gene products were expressed. after analyzing cell lines of fibroblast, muscle, neuronal and epithelial origin, we selected the rat embryo fibroblast cell line ref <dig> as suitable for further study. this was not only due to its flattened morphology and well organized actin stress fibre morphology that would aid morphological characterization of effects on the actin cytoskeleton, but also based on western blotting showing the presence of only one of the tagln gene products namely sm22α . in keeping with previous reports that sm <dig> is an f-actin binding/bundling protein, both the endogenous sm22α, revealed by specific antibody staining, and an exogenous sm22α-gfp construct localized strongly with the prominent f-actin containing stress fibres in these cells .

depleting sm <dig> expression levels alters actin organization
in order to further dissect the role of sm <dig>  we used sirna-mediated sm <dig> depleted ref <dig> cells to investigate the contribution of sm <dig> to the actin morphology. depletion of sm <dig> to between 20% and 40% of normal levels resulted in a dramatic and reproducible change in actin stress fibre morphology . in clones of ref <dig> cells depleted for sm <dig>  using either ref <dig> stably expressing sirna constructs directed against sm <dig>  or transient rnai expression driven from a psiren-dnr-dsred plasmid , there was a reproducible and qualitatively similar reduction in sm <dig> with concomitant loss of actin stress fibre organization. in greater than 70% of wild-type cells actin was organized in longer relatively parallel arrays of fibres, the typical morphology for this cell type . however, in two independent clones  of sm <dig> depleted cells there was a significant increase in the proportion of cells observed with shorter and orthogonal arrays of actin fibres. these cells also had a marked increase in the proportion of cells with no apparent stress fibres. see insets in figure 2a for detail of the phenotypes. these observations demonstrate that sm <dig> has a significant role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and that reduction in sm <dig> levels leads to a less bundled, less well organized and potentially more dynamic actin cytoskeleton.

migration, chemotaxis and invasion in sm <dig> depleted cells
given the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in cell motility, and that sm <dig> levels appear altered in tumour cells that often have altered migratory properties, we next investigated the effect of reducing sm <dig> levels on various in vitro measures of cell migration, chemotaxis and invasion. for improved consistency of cellular response in these experiments ref <dig> cells stably expressing shrna were used with a resulting 50% depletion of sm <dig> compared to sense control . single cell tracking of individual sm <dig> depleted cells revealed that the sm <dig> depleted cells showed impaired movement with considerably reduced trajectories compared to the sense control. this data was then used to calculate cellular velocities, and as expected revealed that both sm <dig> depleted clones had significantly reduced average velocity compared to that of the sense control . similar effects on cell migration have been noted for vascular smooth muscle cells depleted for sm <dig>  <cit> .

we also analyzed whether there was a change in chemotactic response in sm <dig> depleted cells. loss of actin organization can affect not only the mechanics of cell migration, but also cell polarity, which is required for productive directional migration. cells exposed to a serum gradient in a dunn chamber assay showed no significant defect in their chemotactic response, indeed clone 1b appeared to have a higher persistence ratio than wildtype cells  but nonetheless still migrated a shorter distance. however, motility assays carried out on rigid two-dimensional substrates do not always reflect the motility and invasion of cells in three dimensions which would be more analogous to the in vivo situation. we therefore exposed sm <dig> depleted cells to a chemotactic gradient in matrigel coated boyden chambers. interestingly, in this environment the sm <dig> depleted cells were able to invade and migrate through the matrigel much more readily than the control cells . therefore despite the inability to migrate and the relative lack of responsiveness to chemotactic stimuli on hard two-dimensional substrates, sm <dig> depleted cells appear to be much more effective at migrating through soft substrates in response to a similar chemotactic stimulus.

podosomes form spontaneously in sm <dig> depleted cells
podosomes, and the related structures invadopodia, are typically found in macrophages, osteoclasts and tumour cells and are not usually seen in other mesenchymal cells unless transformed for example with active src  <cit> . smooth muscle cells and myoblasts however, have been shown to form podosomes under certain non-transformed conditions, including following phorbol ester or tgf-β stimulation  <cit> . on examining the actin staining pattern of sm <dig> depleted cells in more detail, we noted in addition to the change from the prominent stress fibre phenotype seen in wild type and control ref <dig> cells, to the less organized actin morphology of sm <dig> depleted cells , peripheral bands of diffuse f-actin staining and dense puncta of f-actin were now observed with higher frequency . these f-actin puncta and diffuse clouds of f-actin are reminiscent of podosomes and f-actin rosettes seen in other migratory and invasive cells. quantification of these additional actin phenotypes demonstrated that there was a increase in both lamellipodial rosettes and/or spontaneous podosome formation in cells depleted for sm <dig>  although only the increase in peripheral actin bands was significant. these findings demonstrate a further change in cellular actin structures in response to sm <dig> depletion. the relatively static stress fibre phenotype with associated focal adhesions changes to a more dynamic f-actin based adhesion system is seen by the appearance of more podosomes and rosettes in sm <dig> depleted cells.

depleting sm <dig> expression levels alters levels of reactive oxygen species
deletion of the sm <dig> homologue in yeast leads to increased actin dynamics and reduced levels of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . here we describe sm <dig> depletion having an effect on actin organization by reducing prominent stress fibres to a more disorganized array  also suggestive of an increase in actin dynamics, with further evidence of an increase in actin dynamics revealed by the appearance of podosomes . in addition, invasive motility is also increased. a concomitant reduction in reactive oxygen species would potentially allow a cell depleted for sm <dig> to have an increased survival advantage in a hypoxic tumour environment. in order to test whether deleted sm <dig> levels would also lead to changes in cell's levels of reactive oxygen species, we subjected ref <dig> cells, either normal controls or sm <dig> depleted, to complete serum starvation for either  <dig> or  <dig> hours. serum starvation is a recognized cellular stress that leads to elevated ros in normal and tumour cells . as can be seen from figure 6a, both  <dig> and  <dig> h serum starvation induced a greater than 15-fold increase in ros levels in control ref <dig> cells. however, analysis of ros levels in sm <dig> depleted ref <dig> cells , revealed considerably reduced ros levels at  <dig> h and  <dig> h . moreover untreated sm22-depleted cells had a baseline ros level one third of wildtype cells. sm <dig> depletion per se appears to reduce ros levels in ref <dig> cells, as was seen in yeast when the yeast orthologue scp <dig> was deleted  <cit> , but in addition sm <dig> depletion also appears to be protective against stressful stimuli that lead to ros accumulation.

re-expression of sm <dig> in prostate tumour cell line pc <dig> reduces podosome formation
given that sm <dig> depletion in ref <dig> cells had a significant effect on actin morphology and increased matrigel invasion, and that sm <dig> is also reduced in many tumour cells  <cit> , we investigated the effect of manipulating sm <dig> levels in pc <dig> prostate cancer cells, a cell type that forms podosomes spontaneously  <cit> . as sm <dig> is not detectable by western blotting in pc <dig> cells , we therefore compared the ability of normal pc <dig>  and pc <dig> overexpressing sm <dig> to form podosomes and to migrate through matrigel coated boyden chambers. as can be seen in figure 7a, sm <dig> overexpression reduced the ability of pc <dig> cells to migrate through matrigel in response to a serum gradient. podosomes were detected using antibodies to a podosome component cortactin. pc <dig> cells can be seen to exhibit prominent ruffling membranes and podosomes , as indicated by co-staining of f-actin and cortactin. however, sm <dig> expressing pc <dig> cells had reduced ruffling membranes and were devoid of podosomes .

discussion
as we have demonstrated here, modulation in the levels of sm <dig> in fibroblast cells alters actin morphology which in turn affects their adhesion and migration phenotype. these changes are consistent with increases or decreases in the overall actin bundling activity in the cell resulting in decreased or increased actin dynamics respectively. studies in yeast have revealed similar consequences for the effects of scp1p, the yeast homologue of sm <dig>  in actin dynamics and actin dependent processes such as endocytosis  <cit> . the actin binding and bundling activity of sm <dig> and related proteins is conferred via sequences c-terminal of the calponin homology  domain including a short linker peptide and one to three calponin-like or 'clik23' repeats  <cit> . the presence of multiple clik repeats can increase the actin bundling properties of the protein thus stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton of the cell  <cit> . by the use of the c. elegans unc- <dig> protein, which contains  <dig> clik repeats  <cit> , gimona and colleagues elegantly demonstrated that expressing increasing numbers of unc- <dig> clik repeats progressively stabilized the actin cytoskeleton and inhibited the cell motility and growth in soft agar of breast cancer cell lines  <cit> .

stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton by the overexpression of an actin bundling protein might be expected to have an effect on properties of the cells that rely upon a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. however, the ability of clik repeat-containing proteins and for sm <dig> in particular to achieve this effect appears to be a more specific function that could be associated with suppression of the tumour phenotype. numerous studies have identified sm <dig> as being downregulated in cancer  <cit>  and some have even gone so far as to claim it as a tumour suppressor  <cit> . however, there are contradictory reports suggesting a positive correlation between an increase in sm <dig> levels and colon cancer metastasis to lymph node  <cit>  and increased sm <dig> levels in gastric cancer  <cit> , though in the latter study it was acknowledged that this was likely due to sm <dig> associated with the increased vascularisation of the tumour rather than in the tumour cells themselves. proteomic profiling of prostate cancer cell lines revealed considerable variation in levels of sm <dig> in pc <dig> and lncap cells, even between different clonal variants of the same cell line  <cit> . similar studies comparing prostate, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma also identified increased levels of sm <dig> associated with invasiveness  <cit> .

whilst the various studies investigating sm <dig> levels in different tumours appear to be at odds, one has to consider the cellular basis for the various cancers under scrutiny. sm <dig> is normally expressed in mesenchymal cells and not in epithelial cells, however in tumour cells undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition , it may be that sm <dig> is re-expressed as a consequence of the adoption of the mesenchymal phenotype. a similar phenomenon occurs with other epithelial proteins in emt, such as the e-cadherin to n-cadherin switch  <cit> . therefore differences observed in the levels of sm <dig> in different tumours may be a reflection of several factors, including the tissue/cell of origin, whether it is a primary or secondary tumour, the cellular phenotype with respect to emt, the precision of the sampling of the tumour if it was conducted on a tissue sample, and/or the relationship between a cell line and the original tumour if it is an in vitro study. therefore sm <dig> may be upregulated in an adenocarcinoma during emt, but downregulated in a sarcoma. additionally sm <dig> appears to have a role in regulating transcription, with some genes being regulated in an sm22-dependent way  <cit>  which could also modulate the tumour phenotype. in particular, relief of the repression of the matrix metalloproteinase mmp <dig> expression by sm <dig> in tumour cells where sm <dig> is downregulated  <cit>  would lead to increased mmp <dig> levels. this could have a significant impact on cancer progression, especially invasion and metastasis. whether the effect of sm <dig> re-expression suppressing the matrigel invasion phenotype of pc <dig> cells is a consequence of reduced mmp <dig> expression or simply an effect on the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton will require further analysis. this coupled with our observation that a reduction in sm <dig> levels also caused an increase in podosome and rosette-like structures in non-transformed ref <dig> cells might tend to argue in favour of sm <dig> acting as a tumour suppressor  <cit> . but the lack of a consistent association between a reduction in sm <dig> levels and tumour phenotype, and the contrary evidence of sm <dig> overexpression reducing growth in soft agar,  <cit>  would tend to argue against sm <dig> being a true tumour suppressor. one additional explanation for why loss of sm <dig> might be advantageous in a tumour environment comes from its effect on the levels of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . as we show here, sm <dig> depletion results in ref <dig> cells being less susceptible to stress-induced ros production, in a manner analogous to the reduction in ros levels seen upon scp1p depletion in s. cerevisiae. moreover, oxidative stress in diploid fibroblasts specifically upregulates sm <dig> expression via a tgf-β dependent mechanism, contributing to the senescent phenotype  <cit> . reduction in sm <dig> levels would therefore tend to promote cell survival when cells are under stress, such as in a tumour environment, and may also contribute to increases in actin dynamics that favour metastatic potential.

CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights some of the mechanisms for the apparent anti-oncogenic effect of sm <dig> at the cellular level. others have found that the raised expression of this protein is associated with transforming and anti-transforming phenotypes but this is also known to be the case for many other actin cytoskeleton associated proteins, for example, gelsolin  <cit> . the present study is especially interesting since the down regulation of sm <dig> is associated with the appearance of podosomes, structures implicated in extracellular remodeling and invasion. these results open the way to understanding how these structures form and what the role of sm <dig> and other genes are in this important process.
