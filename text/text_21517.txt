BACKGROUND
packaging of dna into macromolecular nucleoprotein complexes is essential for cell division and the control of gene expression. in eukaryotes, histone proteins associate with dna to form chromatin. chromatin formation occurs during s phase and is dependent on the coordination of histone and dna synthesis. in animals, replication-dependent histone genes are expressed during s phase and provide the protein building blocks for chromatin. they are the only genes known to produce mrnas that lack polyadenylated ) tails, and instead end with a highly conserved hairpin structure. specialised histones, termed replacement variant histones, define specialised chromatin domains and are independently integrated into chromatin. the expression of replacement variant histone genes is not linked to dna synthesis, and their mrnas, which normally lack the hairpin element, are polyadenylated.

in animals, the four core histone proteins h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig> and the linker histone h <dig> are normally encoded by multi copy replication-dependent histone genes . these genes are clustered and have conserved histone specific elements in the 3' untranslated region , including the hairpin rna element. the rna binding protein termed hairpin-binding, or stem-loop binding protein  specifically binds the rna hairpin and is a key regulator of histone gene expression  <cit> . hbp/slbp facilitates histone mrna 3' end processing in the nucleus  <cit> , and controls histone mrna translation  <cit> . an additional motif, the histone downstream element or spacer element , is present 3' of the hairpin and serves as binding site for the u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein . u <dig> snrnp binding occurs via base pairing of the u <dig> snrna, the rna component of the u <dig> snrnp, to the hde and is facilitated by hbp/slbp. it is instrumental for the formation of the histone mrna 3' end by endonucleolytic cleavage after the hairpin, most likely by u7snrnp- mediated recruitment of the rna endonuclease cpsf- <dig>  <cit> . as in mammals, drosophila dslbp is essential and is required for histone-specific mrna 3' end processing  <cit> . in dslbp mutants, histone-specific mrna 3' end processing is inhibited and end formation occurs instead via cryptic polyadenylation signals and results in polyadenylated histone mrna  <cit> . however, this alternative rna 3' end processing is not sufficient to complement the defect in histone gene expression in dslbp mutants.

c. elegans has multicopy h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig> histone genes that have hallmarks of replication-dependent histone genes: they are clustered and have a conserved hairpin structure in the 3'utr  <cit> . this element is followed by a highly conserved potential u7snrnp binding site  <cit> , and then immediately by a conserved polyadenylation signal . all known c. elegans histone h <dig> genes are similar to replacement variant histone genes and do not have the conserved 3'utr sequence elements  <cit> . we previously identified the sole c. elegans hbp/slbp cdl- <dig>  <cit> , and showed that it binds specifically to the c. elegans hairpin rna element  <cit> . cdl- <dig> is essential and required for histone synthesis  <cit> .

here we investigate the expression of c. elegans histone genes during development and elucidate the structure of c. elegans histone mrna 3' ends. we observed that, as is the case in other metazoans, histone mrnas end after the hairpin structure and not after the conserved polyadenylation signal, compatible with histone mrna 3' end formation by histone-specific processing. we demonstrate that knockdown of cdl- <dig> severely inhibits histone gene expression, but does not have a significant effect on histone mrna steady state levels, compatible with a role for cdl- <dig> in post-transcriptional control of histone mrna. finally we report that histone gene expression in c. elegans correlates with the presence of actively dividing cells, consistent with a need to generate histones during cell division.

RESULTS
the structure of c. elegans histone mrnas 3' end structure
a survey of c. elegans histone gene 3'utrs and flanking regions revealed that the conserved  <dig> nucleotide hairpin sequence, the core element of the binding site for cdl- <dig>  <cit> , is embedded in a highly conserved 32– <dig> nucleotide region, and is followed by a similarly conserved aatcc element at a position indicating that this element may act as hde, the binding site for the u <dig> snrnp . in addition, all histone genes have at least one polyadenylation signal aataaa motif, or a variant thereof, immediately downstream of the aatcc. this is followed by a ca dinucleotide that may act as cleavage site, and g/t or t-rich downstream sequences that may act as a downstream element in polyadenylation   <cit> . thus, clearly identifiable and potential histone-specific 3'utr sequence elements  and polyadenylation signals are conserved and in close proximity to each other. polyadenylation signals are also found in other animals downstream of histone genes. for example, a survey of the human h2a histone genes revealed that canonical polyadenylation signals are located at distances from between  <dig> to >  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the histone hairpin. in drosophila, histone genes are organised in tandem repeats with intergenic regions that contain polyadenylation signals at various distances from the hairpin, and these signals are used for mrna 3' end processing in a dslbp mutant background  <cit> . in the presence of dslbp, drosophila histone mrnas end shortly after the hairpin, similar to vertebrate histone mrna  <cit> .

we wished to determine whether histone mrna 3' end processing would result in mrnas ending after the hairpin as in other metazoans, or whether 3' end formation would normally occur by cleavage and polyadenylation using the conserved polyadenylation signal, and result in polyadenylated mrna. first, we exploited the fact that polyadenylated histone mrna is enriched by selection with oligo-dt coupled to cellulose  <cit> . total rna prepared from adult n <dig> animals was isolated and subjected to two subsequent rounds of selection with oligo-dt cellulose, and the rna content was analysed by northern blotting . for comparison we performed the same procedure in parallel with total rna extracted from hela cells. polyadenylated human and c. elegans gapdh mrna were enriched, indicating that the selection procedures were successful. as expected, human histone mrnas, which are known to lack a poly tail  <cit>  and do not to bind to oligo cellulose  <cit> , were lost during the selection for poly rna. c. elegans histone mrnas were similarly lost during the procedure, indicating that the structure of c. elegans histone mrna 3' ends is similar to human histone mrna ends. an exception was the enrichment of a low mobility c. elegans histone h <dig> mrna species that may represent polyadenylated transcripts of c. elegans replacement variant histone h <dig> genes  <cit> .

next, we performed rnase protection assays to further characterise the ends of selected histone mrna species . probes were designed to distinguish between mrnas from the h2b gene his- <dig> and the histone h <dig> genes his- <dig>  his- <dig> and his- <dig> ending after the polyadenylation signal or after the hairpin structure, respectively. the 3'utr and 3' flanking regions of the his- <dig> h2b gene contains the highly conserved  <dig> nucleotide element encompassing the hairpin element, and aatcc and aataaa elements, but differs in the non-conserved regions from other h2b genes. rnase protection with the his- <dig> probe revealed a series of protected fragments. using a combination of dna marker and single-nucleotide ladder produced by koh treatment of 5' end labelled probe rna to estimate the length of the protected fragments, we found that the longest protected fragment was ~ <dig> nucleotides long. this is compatible with protection of the probe by hybridisation with his- <dig> mrna ending after the hairpin. shorter protected fragments were most likely due to partial protection of the probe by hybridisation to other histone transcripts. fragments of ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> nucleotides length can be accounted for by hybridisation to the region containing the hairpin element conserved in the other h2b mrnas and also in mrnas from other histone gene types , and longer fragments of ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> nucleotides most likely arose from hybridisation of the probe to other h2b mrnas that differ from his- <dig> mrna at the 5'end of the protected region .

the 3'utr of the his- <dig> gene is identical to the 3'utrs of the his- <dig> and his- <dig> genes, which are therefore also detected in rnase protection assays with the probe designed to determine the his- <dig> mrna 3' end. rnase protection with total rna prepared from n <dig> adults and the his- <dig> probe revealed protected histone mrna fragments of ~ <dig> nucleotides in length, indicating that the majority of transcripts from the his- <dig>  his- <dig> and his- <dig> genes lacked the polyadenylation signal and ended after the hairpin. thus, the findings obtained with two experimental approaches described – poly selection and rnase protection – are compatible with the majority of c. elegans histone mrnas ending after the hairpin structure and lacking a poly tail.

to independently confirm this we decided to determine the sequence of c. elegans histone mrna 3' ends. we exploited the fact that yeast poly polymerase will add non-template encoded nucleotides to the 3' end of rna molecules with a 3'oh group  <cit> . we first incubated total rna prepared from adult n <dig> animals with inosine triphosphate  and yeast poly polymerase, and subsequently added atp to the reaction. rnas were then reverse transcribed using an oligo-dt/anchor primer and reverse transcriptase. histone 3'utr fragments were pcr amplified using histone-specific primers and an anchor primer, cloned and sequenced . all fragments sequenced were derived from histone mrnas, demonstrating that our protocol was specific and that the histone mrnas had a 3'oh group. comparison with genomic dna sequence revealed that all fragments contained the conserved hairpin structure. significantly, they diverged from genomic dna three to six nucleotides downstream of the hairpin structure, after an a or after a t, where a non-genome encoded tail was observed. in mrna 3' end formation by polyadenylation, the poly tail is added 3' of the aauaaa signal. as this element was not present in any of the sequences analysed, this was in agreement with the results described in figure  <dig> and confirms that histone mrnas 3' ends were not formed by a canonical cleavage/polyadenylation reaction. while in many cases the tail consisted of as only, a significant proportion of these tails started with gs, the result of the addition of inosine, marking the precise position of the mrna end. as incorporation of inosine by poly polymerase is very inefficient compared to the incorporation of adenosine, the proportion of sequences where the tails start with inosine is an underrepresentation of the proportion of mrnas ending after the hairpin  <cit> . in conclusion, this approach showed that histone mrnas end three to six nucleotides 3' of the hairpin structure, after an a or after a u, and have a 3'oh group. this is similar to vertebrate, sea urchin and drosophila histone mrnas that normally end a few nucleotides after the hairpin, 3' of an a and also have a 3'oh group  <cit> . we cannot completely exclude the possibility that some c. elegans histone mrna ends – represented by sequences where inosine was inserted into a poly tail – have poly tails added after the hairpin structure in vivo that were then extended during the experiment by incorporation of first inosine and then adenosine. polyadenylated histone mrnas with a short poly tail added immediately after the hairpin have been detected in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . the tail is lost after fertilisation, concomitant with the translational activation of histone mrna  <cit> . however, the combination of poly selection, rnase protection assays and sequence analysis indicates that the majority of c. elegans histone mrna do not extend past the polyadenylation signal but end three to six nucleotides after the hairpin structure. this is compatible with histone mrna 3' ends being formed by histone mrna cleavage after the hairpin, as in other animals  <cit> .

histone mrna was tailed with itp and subsequently atp using poly polymerase, and histone mrna 3'utrs were amplified by rt-pcr, cloned and sequenced. sequences were aligned using the hairpin structure as anchor . the hairpin structure is followed by genome encoded nucleotides and a non-genome encoded tail added by poly polymerase. the transition point from genomic sequence to non-genomic tail marks the 3' end of histone mrna that is located three to six nucleotides after the hairpin.

knockdown of cdl- <dig> inhibits histone protein synthesis but does not affect histone mrna levels
we previously described the identification of the c. elegans hbp/slbp cdl- <dig> and reported that it is essential for histone gene expression and cell division  <cit> . we observed that cdl- <dig> and rnai targeting histone h <dig> and h <dig> genes resulted both in sterility and early embryonic arrest, linked to defects on chromatin structure  <cit> . we wished to extend this study by determining whether the reduction of histone proteins in cdl- <dig> treated animals was linked to a reduction in steady state histone mrna levels. animals were subjected to cdl- <dig> by feeding. untreated animals and gfp animals were used as controls. as reported previously, depletion of cdl- <dig> expression using the same rnai-by-feeding regime resulted in a protruding vulva  phenotype  <cit> . this phenotype was observed in  <dig> % of cdl- <dig> animals, but not in gfp animals which were wild type in appearance . this was paralleled by an ~ <dig> % reduction of cdl- <dig> mrna in cdl- <dig> animals compared to n <dig> and gfp animals, as determined by semi-quantitative rt-pcr .

we then examined the effect of cdl- <dig> and gfp on histone h2b and h <dig> gene expression. we expect, given the similarities of histone genes and examples from other species, that findings are transferable to the other replication-dependent histone genes. histone h2b and h <dig> mrna levels were not significantly different in animals subjected to the two rnai treatments, and were similar to levels in untreated animals . for comparison we also determined actin mrna levels and could again not find a significant, more then 2-fold change in mrna level. to determine whether the cdl- <dig> treatment caused rna 3' end formation to occur more frequently at polyadenylation signals, we compared the structure of his- <dig> mrna in rna prepared from n <dig> animals and from cdl- <dig> animals . this assay did not provide evidence for a change in histone mrna 3' end formation in cdl- <dig> animals. analysis of histone protein levels by western blotting revealed that histone h2b and h <dig> levels were broadly similar in untreated and gfp n <dig> animals . relative histone protein levels plotted in the graph in figure 4c were standardised using actin as reference. we have currently no explanation for the ~ <dig> % difference in relative histone protein levels between gfp and untreated n <dig> animals. however this effect is minor compared to the severe depletion of histone proteins in cdl- <dig> animals. this effect of cdl- <dig> on histone protein synthesis indicates that cdl- <dig>  as is the case for its homologues in other animals, is mainly required for post-transcriptional control of histone gene expression.

c. elegans histone genes are expressed during periods of active cell division
it is well established that replication-dependent histone gene expression occurs in mitotically active cells and is coupled to dna synthesis. with this in mind we investigated the correlation between histone gene expression and cell division throughout c. elegans development. we examined the level of histone transcripts from wild-type  and glp- <dig> hermaphrodites by northern blotting. hermaphrodites homozygous for the temperature-sensitive glp- <dig> mutation almost completely lack germ line proliferation when grown at the restrictive temperature of 25°c  <cit> . histone h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig> transcripts cannot be detected in glp- <dig> adult hermaphrodites grown at the restrictive temperature , but are clearly present in those grown at the permissive temperature. as these animals lack a germ line, this suggests that histone gene expression in c. elegans adults is largely confined to the germ line; the only actively dividing cells at this stage of development. if this were the case we would expect to see histone gene expression in earlier, larval stages, when many somatic cell lineages are actively dividing, irrespective of whether they have a germ line. we therefore examined histone gene expression in glp- <dig> and bristol  worms at the first and third larval stages and in adults  at the permissive  and non-permissive  temperatures . glp- <dig> worms grown at the permissive temperature did not differ from wild-type in their levels of histone gene expression . similarly, there was no significant difference in the histone h2b and h <dig> rna levels between l <dig> and l <dig> glp- <dig> and wild type larvae grown at the restrictive temperature, consistent with the fact that most of the dividing cells in these developmental stages are somatic cells. in agreement with the results seen in figure 5a, the level of histone gene expression in glp- <dig> adult worms raised at the restrictive temperature is negligible . the lack of histone gene expression in these animals is particularly evident when compared to the level of 18s rrna. these results indicate that, consistent with the role of histones in the cell nucleus, histone gene expression in c. elegans occurs during periods of active cell division.

discussion
the organisation and structure of c. elegans histone genes is similar to histone genes in other metazoans. the conserved hairpin element in the 3' utr, the core element of the binding site for hbp/slbp, is clearly present, and is followed by a conserved element that may serve as the u <dig> snrnp binding site hde . however all c. elegans histone genes have a conserved potential polyadenylation signal immediately downstream of the hde, a feature not shared with histone genes from other organisms. we have used three independent approaches to analyse the structure of histone mrna 3' ends. they reveal that histone mrnas end after the hairpin structure, indicating that 3' end processing of c. elegans histone mrnas occurs via cleavage immediately after the hairpin, and that cleavage following the putative polyadenylation signal occurs rarely, if at all. first, we found that c. elegans histone mrnas were lost during selection of poly mrna using oligo-dt cellulose, similar to hela cell histone mrna known to end after the hairpin and to lack a poly tail . next, we investigated the structure of histone mrna ends using an rnase protection assay designed to distinguish between rnas ending after the hairpin, and rnas ending after the polyadenylation signal . the protection patterns obtained indicate that the vast majority of transcripts of the histone genes analysed  end after the hairpin signal. finally, cloning and sequencing of synthetically poly tailed histone mrnas showed that none of the mrnas included the putative hde element or polyadenylation signal . instead this revealed that histone mrnas end three to six nucleotides after the hairpin structure and, as they are a substrate for poly polymerase, have a 3'oh group. thus our data indicate that the structure of c. elegans histone mrna 3' ends is similar to the structure of histone mrna 3' ends in vertebrates and drosophila  <cit> , and is typical for histone-specific mrna 3' end processing mediated by the u7snrnp and associated factors. it will be interesting to analyse the function of the conserved aatcc element. we believe that this is the core motif of a u <dig> snrnp binding site. we will exploit this to search for u <dig> snrna, using bioinformatics and experimental approaches.

it is known that polyadenylation signals contribute to transcription termination by changing the properties of the passing rna polymerase  <cit> . perhaps, in c. elegans replication-dependent histone genes the polyadenylation signal functions as transcription terminator rather then as an rna processing site. we also cannot currently exclude the possibility that, instead of histone-specific processing, the mrna 3' ends are formed by cleavage after the polyadenylation signal, followed by 3'-5' exonucleolytic trimming of the pre-mrna up to the hairpin element.

we previously described that cdl- <dig> results in the inhibition of histone synthesis  <cit> . here we analyse this in more detail and show that cdl- <dig> does not significantly affect histone mrna levels, but, as shown previously, severely inhibits histone protein expression . this indicates that cdl- <dig> functions similar to hbp/slbp in mammals and in drosophila. in these animals, hbp/slbp controls post-transcriptional regulation of histone gene expression including mrna 3' end processing and translation. it will be interesting to determine whether similar to the role of hbp/slbp in other organisms, cdl- <dig> is required for histone mrna 3' end processing, translation and perhaps also mrna stability control in c. elegans.

we have shown that during c. elegans development, histone mrna levels positively correlate with mitotically active tissues . thus, as in other organisms, c. elegans histone gene expression is cell cycle regulated. in wild-type embryos we detected a two-fold reduction of histone mrna levels, relative to 18s rrna, in l3-stage animals compared to l <dig> larvae, presumably reflecting the fact that proportionally more cells are proliferating in l <dig> larvae compared to l <dig> larvae. relative histone mrna levels were again increased in adult n <dig> animals, which was expected since the adult germ line is mitotically active, and most adults would contain a number of highly proliferating early embryos. this pattern was independent of temperature and was similar at 16°c and 25°c. the fact that no histone mrnas could be detected from glp <dig> adult animals grown at  <dig> °c, which essentially lack germ line proliferation when grown at the restrictive temperature, shows that in adults most, if not all histone gene expression is confined to the germ line. thus our findings indicate that the link between dna synthesis and histone gene expression observed in mammals and drosophila is also the case for c. elegans.

CONCLUSIONS
c. elegans is a well established animal model to study development. in contrast, comparatively little is known about the control of gene expression in this animal. here we show that histone gene expression is linked to cell proliferation, and is subject to similar post-transcriptional controls as histone gene expression in other animal species. thus c. elegans will be an ideal model to investigate the regulation of histone gene expression during animal development.
