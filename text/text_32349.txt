BACKGROUND
the genus seriola, which includes yellowtail , amberjack , and kingfish , accounted for >60% of the total japanese mariculture production in  <dig>  <cit> . yellowtail, in particular, are very popular with japanese consumers. at present, culturists rely on the capture of wild juveniles to provide the seed as commercial scale methods for captive reproduction and early rearing have yet to be developed. thus, there is a clear need to develop methods for breeding to preserve wild stocks and facilitate the selection of economically important traits. the latter requires genomic information such as the chromosomal locations of genetic polymorphisms and expressed genes. currently, there are a limited number of yellowtail families available for linkage analysis. even though a female linkage map with  <dig> microsatellite markers has been reported  <cit> , there remains a need for maps of expressed sequence tags  and cdnas to inform yellowtail genomic structure. recently, linkage maps were developed for several, commonly cultured species, including atlantic salmon  <cit> , atlantic cod  <cit> , common carp  <cit> , and catfish  <cit> . these maps were created with microsatellite markers and gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms  derived from ests. snps, the most abundant type of dna sequence polymorphism, are suitable for high-throughput genotyping and provide enhanced possibilities for genetic and breeding applications, linkage map development, assessment of genetic variability, and marker-assisted breeding. furthermore, snp correlation analysis can be used to facilitate selective breeding for desirable traits. to place marker dna sequences on a linkage map, there must be polymorphisms within the families that are used for the linkage analysis. ests sometimes have snps, but many ests lack snps in linkage analysis families obtained by mating one male and one female. to address this, we physically mapped a large number of ests using radiation hybrid  cell lines.

an rh map is a powerful tool for building a physical map of the whole genome. this technique can be used to determine the order and distance between dna markers by analyzing their presence or absence in hybrid cells, and to localize both polymorphic markers and non-polymorphic markers, such as ests. furthermore, rh maps serve as a valuable tool for the molecular identification of mutations using a candidate gene approach, and can be used to facilitate the construction of gene orthology relationships through conserved synteny analysis. in mammals, rh maps have been reported for humans  <cit> , mice  <cit> , dogs  <cit> , cats  <cit> , horses  <cit> , and pigs  <cit> . in addition, six rh panels have been published for five teleost fish species: two zebrafish rh panels were derived from the fibroblast cell line ab <dig>  <cit>  one gilthead seabream rh panel was derived from primary fin fibroblasts  <cit> , a medaka panel was derived from a fin fibroblast cell line  <cit> , a european seabass panel from splenocytes  <cit> , and a nile tilapia panel from a homozygous clonal line  <cit> . in the current study, we developed the first rh panel derived from a yellowtail fin fibroblast cell line.

we used a nanofluidic dynamic array  high-throughput genotyping system. this system was originally developed for snp genotyping assays and gene expression analyses, and is able to perform  <dig>  real-time polymerase chain reactions   on a single chip. we adapted this system for use as an expression assay platform to map est and snp sites as dna markers.

here, we report on the production of a yellowtail fin radiation hybrid cell line and the construction of a 580-marker map that includes  <dig> microsatellite markers.

RESULTS
visual analysis of chromosomes in the fibroblast cell line
a photomicrograph of mitotic metaphase chromosomes from a yellowtail fibroblast cell is shown in figure  <dig>  the modal number of chromosomes was  <dig>  this number is consistent with a previous report that noted the diploid chromosome number in yellowtail gill cells was  <dig> with a karyotype consisting of one pair of submetacentrics, one pair of subtelocentrics, and  <dig> pairs of acrocentrics  <cit> . therefore, we divided the rh map into  <dig> linkage groups.

construction of an rh panel
a fibroblast cell line with an integrated geneticin® resistance gene was irradiated with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  rads  to induce chromosome breakage. hybrid clones maintaining yellowtail genome fragments were selected based on their growth in dmem medium containing 1 mg/ml geneticin®. we were able to obtain hybrid clones at all radiation doses. specifically, we recovered  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clones from those exposed to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  rads, respectively. in total,  <dig> hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse b <dig> cells. those numbers were similar to what has previously been obtained using human   <cit> , zebrafish   <cit> , gilthead seabream   <cit> , medaka   <cit> , european seabass   <cit> , and nile tilapia cells   <cit> . thus, we felt confident that the number of yellowtail hybrid cell lines we obtained would be a sufficient starting point from which to select  <dig> hybrid clones for the rh panel.

the retention frequency was estimated for each clone by genotyping a set of  <dig> microsatellite markers that were selected from the linkage map , and by scoring them as present, absent, or ambiguous. the retention frequency of the  <dig> microsatellite markers in the  <dig> hybrid cell lines is shown in figure  <dig>  the average retention frequencies at each radiation dose were approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively. the average retention frequency of the  <dig> hybrid cell lines was approximately  <dig> %. these values were not correlated with the radiation dose. however, we did expect the size of the chromosome fragments retained within the hybrid cell lines to differ depending on the intensity of radiation received by the cells.

a set of  <dig> hybrid cell lines was selected to form the rh panel, including  <dig> lines from the  <dig> -rad dose,  <dig> from the  <dig> -rad dose,  <dig> from the  <dig> -rad dose,  <dig> from the  <dig> -rad dose,  <dig> from the  <dig> -rad dose, and  <dig> from the  <dig> -rad dose. in general, the hybrid cell lines were selected based on high-retention frequency values; however, in one case a cell line was substituted to obtain a better representation of the whole genome. the retention frequencies of each clone in the rh panel were in the range of  <dig> – <dig> %, and averaged  <dig> %. for comparison, the average retention frequencies for the rh panel clones in previous studies were 22% in zebrafish  <cit> , 30% in gilthead seabream  <cit> , and  <dig> % in european seabass  <cit> . thus, by analogy to those studies, the yellowtail rh panel was an adequate starting point for the construction of a physical map.

construction of an rh map
the genomic dna that was extracted from the rh panel was pre-amplified with  <dig> pooled primer pairs. the pre-amplified dna was used as the template for the second pcr with each nested primer pair for each of the  <dig> markers using the biomark™ hd system . the biomark™ hd system is able to perform high-throughput tm shift reactions, snp analysis, and gene expression analysis. therefore, we took advantage of this system to conduct marker genotyping of the physical map using a  <dig>  nanofluidic dynamic array. the results of the reaction were estimated from the ct  values, the melting temperature of amplification products, and the amplification curves of the pcr products . we then confirmed the existence of the amplification products using these three analytical measurements. the proportion of useful primer pairs among the  <dig> markers was approximately 25–50%, owing to the sensitivity and specificity of the system. we did not detect any non-specific amplification products. the biomark™ hd system provided results from ~24– <dig> primer pairs in 6 h, and clearly had higher throughput relative to electrophoresis. moreover, the reproducibility of the dynamic array data for replicates within a chip and between different chips is very good  <cit> . by performing pcr on a dynamic array, one can obtain high-throughput gene expression data that are essentially identical in quality to conventional microliter reverse-transcription-quantitative pcr and are of superior quality to publicly available array data from the same tissue type  <cit> .

we genotyped  <dig> markers to construct the rh map. the two-point analysis, performed at an lod score of  <dig>  and a distance threshold of  <dig>  yielded  <dig> groups using carthagene software  <cit> . furthermore, by reference to the locations of several markers on the previously constructed genetic linkage map for yellowtail,  <dig> markers were assigned to  <dig> linkage groups. fifty-one markers in  <dig> groups were not distributed among the genetic linkage groups because of the lod score or the distance threshold error. thus, the current yellowtail physical map was constructed with a final set of  <dig> markers consisting of  <dig> genes and  <dig> microsatellite markers that were genotyped by pcr and electrophoresis . for individual groups, the rh map had a size range of  <dig> – <dig>  cr  with an average of  <dig>  cr. the combined size of all rh groups was  <dig>  cr. the yellowtail genome is estimated to be  <dig> mbp  <cit> , which yields a value of  <dig> cr =  <dig>  kbp .

we were able to quickly obtain a large quantity of data using the biomark™ hd system, highlighting its utility for developing rh maps. furthermore, the janus™  and the biomek™  units can pipet sub-microliter volumes accurately into hundreds or thousands of pcr plates per day. alternatively, assays can be transferred to a completely different genotyping platform. for instance, taqman™, molecular beacon™, and scorpion® assays can be run on fluidigm instruments that use automation and microfluidics to perform  <dig> single assays on  <dig> individual samples in a single plate. the reduction in assay volumes substantially decreases reagent costs, although the instruments themselves require the purchase of consumables  <cit> . the dynamic array does have some limitations, including the inability to run specific real-time pcr conditions for individual snps, and the need for specialized hardware. nevertheless, the accuracy, efficiency, and cost savings in time, reagents, and dna for a nanofluidics dynamic array make it suitable for medium- to high-throughput genotyping against targeted snps  <cit> .

after developing our rh map, rh group  <dig>  and  <dig> other rh groups were compared with the genetic linkage groups . the distances between adjacent markers and the local order of markers were compared to confirm the accuracy of sq <dig> in the yellowtail physical map. the order in which genes were arranged in sq <dig> was the same as that observed in the yellowtail linkage map, demonstrating the local accuracy of the physical map. a manuscript fully describing the genetic linkage map data is in preparation, thus, other map data are not shown here. once a high-density yellowtail rh map is constructed, this rh map will be compared with the  <dig> genetic linkage maps to confirm the accuracy of the local order of markers. to anchor the rh map to the karyotype, ests and microsatellite markers should be used simultaneously in fish  experiments and rh mapping  <cit> .

synteny relationship with medaka
the  <dig> yellowtail marker sequences within the sq <dig> rh map were compared with the cdna sequences of three fish species: zebrafish , medaka , and the green-spotted pufferfish , using the tblastx algorithm. of the  <dig> sequences,  <dig>  genes had identified orthologs in zebrafish and the green-spotted pufferfish, and  <dig>  had recognizable orthologs in medaka . furthermore, we found syntenic relationships among sq <dig>  chromosome  <dig> of medaka, and chromosome  <dig> of the green-spotted pufferfish. however, the syntenic relationship between sq <dig> and the zebrafish sequence was rather low. medaka are a member of the order beloniformes, which includes freshwater and marine fish such as pacific saury and flying fish. zebrafish are a member of cypriniformes, which consists almost exclusively of freshwater fish. notably, our sq <dig> synteny results reflect the known taxonomic relationships of these fish. in teleostei, it is thought that a whole-genome duplication and eight subsequent major rearrangements occurred about 314– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . furthermore, it is thought that zebrafish and medaka diverged after the eight major rearrangement events. therefore, the availability of the yellowtail rh panel enabling the construction of a high-density map offers an opportunity to investigate chromosomal evolution after the eight major rearrangements.

the production of a high-density rh map with about  <dig>  ests is underway and will provide information on conserved synteny and chromosome evolution in fish species. furthermore, the high-density yellowtail rh map can be used to highlight associations with economically important breeding traits using snp chips, and identify their chromosomal location.

CONCLUSIONS
a yellowtail rh panel was constructed to facilitate the localization of markers from  <dig> hybrid cell lines. then, the framework rh map was constructed with  <dig> markers containing ests and snps. information from the high-density physical map will facilitate the discovery of linked regions associated with economically important traits. this will, in turn, aid the development of yellowtail strains suitable for aquaculture.
