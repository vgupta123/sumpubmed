BACKGROUND
soybean cyst nematode  is one of the most destructive pests of soybean  merr.). scn suppresses soybean yield, and causes an estimated seed yield loss of approximately $ <dig>  billion dollars per year only in united states  <cit> . h. glycine probably evolved either in china or japan and had been spread to the new world  <cit> .

an scn race was first recognized in  <dig>  and a total of  <dig> races were reported based on all the possible combinations on four soybean differentials including peking, pickett, pi  <dig> and pi  <dig>  <cit> . recently, the hg type based on eight diffferential cultivars was introduced to more accurately represent the h. glycine population types found in soil instead of the previously described race  <cit> . h. glycine is now widely distributed in more than  <dig> countries, particularly in those areas where soybean is grown on a commercial scale, like usa and china  <cit> . hg type  <dig> or  <dig>  was mainly distributed in the south of 37°n latitude in the united states. and the hg type  <dig> .5-  were predominant for soybean production areas in the north of 37° n latitude in the united states  <cit> . in china eight races of scn predominate   <cit> . hg type  <dig> was predominant in the northeastern provinces of china , and hg type  <dig> ,5- was one of the two predominant races in huang-huai valleys   <cit> .

a limited control of this pest is achieved by different forms of rotations and the application of pesticides. however, breeding cultivars with resistance has been the most effective and economical way to control scn. a number of soybean lines have resistance to scn, but only a few of them have been used to breed commercial soybean  <cit> . currently, most scn-resistant cultivars in the north central united states were developed from a single source of resistance, pi <dig>  only a few cultivars were derived from pi  <dig>  and pi  <dig>   <cit> . pathogen populations have the ability to mutate, recombine and/or drift quickly to new hg types that overcome plant resistances  <cit> . therefore, using the soybean varieties with the genetic background of a few  resistant cultivars, like pi <dig> and peking, would lead to the changes of predominant races and the loss of resistance  <cit> . hence, multiple sources of resistance are urgently needed for effective management of scn in the world.

the knowledge of genetic architecture of scn resistance is very important for breeding resistance varieties  <cit> . so far, genetic architecture analyses mainly depended on traditional quantitative trait locus  linkage mapping based on bi-parental populations. once the desired qtl were mapped, molecular markers that were tightly linked to the qtl could be applied in marker-assisted breeding to improve and shorten the process for developing cultivars with resistance to scn. many qtl conferring resistance to scn in soybean have been mapped on almost all chromosomes  based on ssr markers . of them, two major qtl, rhg <dig> on gm <dig> and rhg <dig> on gm <dig>  <cit> , were identified in many different resistance sources. genes and their alleles underlying both loci were identified from pi <dig> and cultivar forrest, respectively  <cit> . fine mapping, sequencing and gene analysis of rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> were reported . the receptor like kinase at rhg1-a caused pleiotropic resistance to sudden death syndrome and soybean cyst nematode as a transgene by altering signaling responses  <cit> . the study on rhg1-b allele’s locus by cook et al.  <cit>  considered the scn resistance of rhg <dig> in pi  <dig> was conferred by three genes, and the copy number variation of these genes caused the phenotypic differences between susceptible and resistant varieties. the scn resistance of rhg <dig> in forrest was controlled by a serine hydroxymethyl transferase gene, that acted in cellular one-carbon metabolism  <cit> . the mutation of this gene could disturb the concentration of folate and lead to a nutritional deficiency detrimental to the life cycle of scn  <cit> . although few scn resistance genes have been cloned based on the identified qtl, the large confidence genomic intervals of most qtl impaired the precise identification of causative genes.

association mapping, which exploits historical recombination events at the population level, could supplement linkage mapping in the dissection of complex trait variation  <cit> . genome-wide association  mapping, a specific association mapping stage, is a powerful complementary strategy for an alternation of classical bi-parental linkage mapping to dissect complex traits by using the naturally occurring population  <cit> . gwas mapping approach has been used with success in studies on important traits of model plants and crops, such as arabidopsis thaliana, rice, maize, sorghum, barley . recently, gwas mapping of seed quality related traits and disease resistance of soybean were reported. hwang et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in  <dig> different genomic regions significantly associated with seed protein content using a data set of  <dig>  snps. a major seed protein qtl has been previously mapped to the same location and potential candidate genes have recently been identified in this region. twenty five snps in  <dig> different genomic regions associated with seed oil content were also detected by gwas. gwas mapping of sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance in soybean with a genotyping-by-sequencing approach  <cit> , have also been used to identify qtl for sudden death syndrome using soybean reference genome sequence and high throughput snp assays. both known qtl and new quantitative trait nucleotide  were detected and candidate genes were predicted in the above two studies  <cit> . therefore, gwas mapping could detect beneficial alleles from excellent germplasm with different genetic background in one mapping panel and obtain the fine map of association genomic regions and candidate genes by using sufficient density of snp markers. whole genome sequencing  is the most straightforward method for gwas; however, wgs is not still affordable for most researcher, especially for genotyping hundreds of samples. different form wgs, reduced representation sequencing have many advantage such as reducing the genome complexity and lower cost. to date, many reduced representation sequencing have been developed such as restriction site–associated dna  tag sequencing 2b-rad  <cit> , and specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing   <cit> . with comparison with other reduced representation sequencing method, slaf-seq have definite advantage such as higher genotyping accuracy, lower sequencing costs, higher efficient detect system, which was successfully applied in rice  <cit> , sesame  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . the objectives of the present study were; 1) to investigate the genetic architecture of soybean resistance to scn hg type  <dig> and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> by gwas using reduced genomic sequencing data from  <dig> diverse soybean germplasm mostly collected from china where scn resistant germplasm was enriched; 2) to evaluate the beneficial alleles of each snp marker associated with the resistance to the two tested hg types in order to provide valuable markers to breed soybean lines with scn resistance; and 3) to analyze the genetic landscape of each association signal to identify genes that may participate in the interaction of scn and soybean roots.

RESULTS
snp genotyping
the genotyped samples included a set of  <dig> soybean germpasm collected mostly in china, representing a broad diversity of genotypes . the genomic dna of the  <dig> accessions were partially sequenced using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing  approach by illumina genome analyzer ii  <cit> . the  <dig> million paired-end reads with 45 bp read length were mapped to the reference soybean genome  and a mean of  <dig>  high quality tags were identified from paired-end reads for each accession. a data set of  <dig>  snps at minor allele frequency  ≥ 4 % was generated from  <dig>  high quality tags . the rate of missing data was controlled at less than 10 % for each accession. the set of snps covered  <dig> chromosomes of soybean and the snp numbers ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   with an average number of  <dig>  for each soybean chromosome. because the length of g. max genome was around  <dig> megabases  <cit> , the resulting snp density of one snp per  <dig> kbp was available in the present study. this sequencing-based snp map would offer benefits for mapping studies for many other soybean traits.

linkage disequilibrium  and population structure analysis
to characterize the mapping resolution for genome wide association study, the distributions of the average extent of ld decay and r <dig> between the different physical distances were quantified. ld decay for each chromosome was different . the mean ld decay distance also varied among all chromosomes, ranging from  <dig> kbp to  <dig> kbp. the average r <dig> for all chromosomes was estimated at  <dig> kbp. the marker density would meet the demand of gwas mapping based on this ld pattern.fig.  <dig> linkage disequilibrium pattern of soybean genome



to understand the population stratification of mapping panel, principle component analysis was conducted for the association panel based on  <dig>  snp markers. the result showed that the total amount of genetic variation explained by the first  <dig> principal components was only  <dig>  %, indicating that the lines of the association panel were randomly sampled. the association panel was separated into three sub-populations by the first two pcs with some intermediate individuals among them . however, the accessions could not to be grouped clearly by either pc <dig> and pc <dig>  or pc <dig> and pc <dig> . the genetic variation was decreased sharply at the point of pc <dig> . therefore, the population structure could be well controlled with the first three pcs.fig.  <dig> population structure evaluation based on principle component analysis. a–c population structure was revealed by principle component  <dig>  and principle component  <dig> , pc <dig> and pc <dig>  pc <dig> and pc <dig>  d genetic variations of the first  <dig> pcs

the genetic basis of natural variation for soybean resistance to scn hg type  <dig> and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> were explored by using an association panel of  <dig> diverse germplasm genotyped with  <dig>  snp markers. a total of  <dig> association signals were identified with p <  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for the two traits in a genome wide scan under compressed mixed linear model that controlled the population structure and familial relatedness . among the  <dig> association signals, eighteen were declared significant under the threshold of p <  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  the  <dig> peak snps explained  <dig> – <dig>  % of the total phenotypic variation. twelve signals were significantly associated with the resistance to hg type  <dig> and another seven signals were found to be related to the resistance to hg type  <dig> , <dig> , <dig>  the known scn resistant loci, rhg <dig> and rhg <dig>  were identified by the present study for soybean resistance to hg type  <dig>  the rhg <dig> locus was also found to contribute resistance to hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig>  the rs <dig> located on gm <dig> was significantly associated with the resistance for both hg types. it could be an important locus that offered resistance to multiple hg types. eight signals overlapped with reported qtl, and another eight were located in the linked region of known qtl . three qtl were newly found in the present study.fig.  <dig> genome wide association signals for soybean resistance to hg type  <dig> and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig>  a,c genome wide manhattan plots of associations from compressed mixed linear model. x axis showed the snps along each chromosome; y axis was the −log  <dig>  for the association for soybean resistance to hg type  <dig> and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig>  respectively. b,d quantile-quantile plots for mixed linear models of the resistance to hg type  <dig> and hg type  <dig> . <dig> .7

beneficial allele evaluation of peak snp and genetic architecture of significantly associated genomic regions
to confirm the beneficial allele of each peak snp associated with scn resistance, the average fi value of the soybean accessions that carried each allele of peak snps were calculated. the result indicated that the average fi values of accessions with resistant alleles were significantly lower than that of the accessions with susceptible alleles for all  <dig> association signals. they were also lower than the average fi value of the whole association panel . therefore, these resistant alleles could be useful for marker-assistant selection  of scn resistance.

the candidate genes related to the identified loci against scn hg type  <dig> and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> was further evaluated. gene models that located in  <dig> kbp genomic region upstream and downstream of each peak snp in the reference soybean genome  were considered to be resistance gene candidates since the mean ld decay distance of soybean genome was around  <dig> kbp according to the present study and the reports of hwang et al.  and lam et al.   <cit> . a total of  <dig> soybean gene models were found in the flanking regions of each peak snp. of these gene models,  <dig> genes had no functional annotation. fourteen genes belonged to the domains of unknown function families. among the other  <dig> gene models, several genes encoded serine/threonine protein kinases known to be involved in plant disease response. genes encoding leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins, which might function in plant disease resistance pathways in response to a variety of external stimuli from pathogens, were also identified. five other domain types were common including cytochrome p450s, protein kinases, zinc fingers, ring domains, myb and wrky families . of these gene families, there were five clusters of genes with disease resistance protein and/or lrr protein domains that were found in both side of rs <dig> on gm <dig> that was associated with the resistance to both hg type  <dig> and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig>  the hg type  <dig> resistance loci , as well as hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> resistance locus  were tightly linked with the genes of ring/u-box superfamily protein or ring-h <dig> finger c1a gene. the distance of each ring gene to their corresponding peak snp ranged from  <dig>  kbp to  <dig>  kbp with an average distance of  <dig>  kbp. it could be inferred that the ring/u-box superfamily protein might be involved in the disease resistance responsive to hg type  <dig> and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> fig.  <dig> main gene families in the flanking genomic regions of peak snp



discussion
the precisely identifying and positioning of qtl are crucial for successful mas. up to now, many qtl associated with scn resistance have been effectively tagged with different molecular marker systems, including ssr, rapd, rflp and snp . however, no sequencing based mapping like gwas for qtl or genes underlying the resistance to scn has been reported so far. in the present study, the gwas mapping approach and sequence based snp maps with a large and diverse sample of soybean germplasm collection were used to identify the quantitative trait loci associated with the resistance to scn hg type  <dig>  and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> . a total of  <dig> qtl were identified.

among the  <dig> qtn  associated with qtl underlying resistance to scn hg type  <dig>  one qtn  was identified on chromosome  <dig> , where a known and major qtl region associated with rhg <dig> locus had been commonly reported before . concibido et al.  <cit>  reported that a qtl near the rhg <dig> locus could explain 15 % of the total phenotypic variation in pi  <dig> to scn hg type  <dig>  the rhg <dig> locus was confirmed as one of the major qtl controlling soybean resistance against scn hg type  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, kazi et al. and ferreira et al.  <cit>  confirmed the effect of rhg <dig> on resistance to race  <dig> and  <dig>  while rhg <dig> was less associated with resistance to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, this locus was also detected to be related to the resistance to hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig>  in our study, indicating that it could underlie scn resistance more than one races simultaneously and might facilitate to breed new soybean varieties resistant to scn race  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

in soybean, gm  <dig>  was very important for scn resistance. the rhg <dig> loci, located on gm  <dig>  had been conformed to have an impact on the depression of scn development in several resistance lines and provided scn resistance in many commercial varieties from several resistance sources . for example, concibido et al.  <cit>  reported the recessive gene rhg  <dig> that located on gm  <dig> was identified to resistant to scn race  <dig> and  <dig> as a major scn resistance source. similarly, wu et al.  <cit>  also detected a major qtl near rhg <dig> with a relative large r <dig>  resistant to scn race  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. here, the snp rs <dig>  associated with the resistance to scn hg type  <dig> , was detected to fall within the rhg <dig> locus and was located in the  <dig> kbp copy number variation  region of rhg <dig> locus. the snp marker rs <dig> was  <dig>  kpb,  <dig>  kbp and  <dig>  k bp distances from the three key genes  in cnv region  <cit> . however, the distance between ssr marker barcsoyssr_18_ <dig> and rhg 1-b was  <dig> kbp in a fine mapping study of rhg  <dig> locus that was reported by kim et al.  <cit> . the distance from marker to causal genes in our study was much shorter than that reported by kim et al., indicating that better mapping result could be available from gwas using snp markers. the locus rs <dig> could be more effective for marker-assisted selection of lines resistant to scn.

additionally, most of the snps associated with the resistance to scn hg type  <dig>  fell within the previously reported scn resistant qtl intervals in the present study . for example, two loci , resistant to scn hg type  <dig> on gm  <dig> , were similar to the results reported by yue et al. and vuong et al.  <cit> . in particular, the locus rs <dig> on gm  <dig>  was detected to associate with the resistance to scn hg type  <dig>  and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> simultaneously, which was similar to the results reported by chang et al.  <cit> .

a total of seven snps were associated with the resistance to scn hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> , and six of them were within the previously reported marker intervals  <cit> . of them, rs <dig> and rs <dig> were overlapped with the same loci associated with resistance to scn hg type  <dig>  suggesting that they could accelerate the development of soybean varieties with the resistance both to scn hg type  <dig> and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> 

in the present study, rs <dig> on gm  <dig> , rs <dig> on gm <dig>  and rs <dig> on gm <dig>  were the novel loci reported for scn resistance. they might have the potential to be used in mas for enhanced scn hg type  <dig> and hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> resistance.

here, we mapped  <dig> qtl representing  <dig> genomic regions associated with soybean resistance to hg type  <dig> and/or hg type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig>  more than  <dig> candidate genes were found in the linked region of these qtl, and as many as 25 % might have scn response. disease resistance-like proteins were found to be induced by different hg types of scn in other studies too such as by mazarei et al. and matsye et al.  <cit> . that suggested that disease resistance like proteins was a class of genes with broad-spectrum resistance to scn. in addition, expression patterns of genes that encoded cytochrome p <dig>  zinc finger protein, myb domain protein, and wrky dna-binding protein that were mapped here were changed in scn induced soybean roots . saur-like genes has been suggested to encode short-lived nuclear proteins involved in auxin signaling by interacting with calmodulin  <cit> . a report about auxin-responsive factor  in arabidopsis thaliana described that double mutants of arf gene showed a strong auxin phenotype that resulted in the absence of lateral root formation than single mutant expression. in addition, glyma.02g <dig> that encoded the ring-h <dig> finger domain was the nearest gene to rs <dig> which is a novel locus associated with resistance to scn. ring-h <dig> finger as an domain in e <dig> ubiquitin ligase was considered to participate in the degradation of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum in human  <cit> . e <dig> ubiquitin ligases was known to play an important role in mediating plant defence signaling  <cit> . therefore, glyma.02g <dig> with ring-h <dig> finger domain might be a new gene source of scn resistance. however, many such genes alter the degree of susceptibility  more than the degree of resistance .

CONCLUSIONS
gwas was successfully used to examine the genetic architecture of resistance to scn hg types  <dig> and type  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> in multiple genetic backgrounds. nineteen associations were obtained for scn resistance to the two hg types. the multiple beneficial alleles from resistant germplasm may be useful to breed varieties with improved resistance to scn. identification of causal gene underlying scn resistance may be assisted.
