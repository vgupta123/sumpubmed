BACKGROUND
anthocyanins represent a major group of the flavonoid family, consisting of small water-soluble molecules stored in vacuoles. as widespread plant secondary metabolites, they are responsible for red and blue colors of many plant tissues  <cit> . anthocyanins, as major pigments, play important roles in plant reproduction by attracting pollinators and seed dispersers and in protection from photo-oxidative stress  <cit> . in crops, ornamental plants, and fruits, they constitute a key trait for the aesthetic quality of the product. in grape, they play a crucial role as they participate in both wine color and organoleptic properties due to their complex interactions with other phenolic compounds, as well as with proteins and polysaccharides  <cit> .

the anthocyanins identified in vitis vinifera are 3-o-monoglucosides  and 3-o-acyl monoglucosides derived from the five main anthocyanidins--delphinidin , cyanidin , peonidin , petunidin  and malvidin --, which differ from each other in the number and position of the hydroxyl and methoxyl groups located on their b-ring : delphinidin and cyanidin being unmethylated, peonidin and petunidin mono-methylated and malvidin di-methylated. methylation by s-adenosyl-l-methionine  dependent-o-methyltransferase plays an important role in modifying the structure of plant secondary metabolites. for anthocyanins, methylation stabilizes the phenolic b ring, thus reducing the reactivity of the overall molecule  <cit> , and increases water solubility, thus reinforcing its color properties  <cit> . the color of anthocyanins greatly depends on the number of hydroxyl groups: the larger the number of groups, the bluer the color. on the other hand, the o-methylation of anthocyanins has a reddening effect.

the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway has been extensively characterized in numerous plant species  <cit> . in grapevine, the core structural genes of the anthocyanin pathway leading to the synthesis of dp 3-glc and cy 3-glc have been cloned and characterized  <cit> . recently, two anthocyanin o-methyltransferases  able to methylate anthocyanins in vitro and in vivo have been identified  <cit> . anthocyanin biosynthesis is controlled by myb-bhlh transcriptional complexes that activate the expression of structural genes involved in the late steps of the pathway  <cit> . in particular, the vvmyba genes induce the transcription of ufgt and aomt in colored tissues  <cit>  and were shown to control anthocyanin accumulation in grape  <cit> . while anthocyanin methylation in grapes is altered by environmental and cultural conditions  <cit> , it is also strongly affected by genetic factors. indeed, both the total amount of anthocyanins and the relative abundance of single anthocyanins are extremely variable among red--to blue-skinned cultivars. in spite of this variability, mono--and di-methyl derivatives are largely predominant  <cit> , malvidin 3-glucoside being the main anthocyanin in most cultivars and peonidin 3-glucoside usually being less abundant  <cit> . genes encoding flavonoid 3'--and 3'5'--hydroxylases involved in anthocyanins hydroxylation  <cit>  or genes encoding o-methyltransferase involved in anthocyanins methylation  <cit>  can potentially generate differences in anthocyanin composition. the availability of the full genome sequence  <cit>  as well as broad genetic resources will help us to further clarify the mechanisms involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in grape.

the objective of this study was to understand the architecture of the genetic control of anthocyanin methylation in grape and to improve our understanding of the complex factors involved in the regulation of anthocyanin methylation. two qtls for anthocyanin methylation variation were identified: one colocalized with a myba gene cluster and the second colocalized with a cluster of three putative aomt genes. this work aims to validate the role of the latter in anthocyanin methylation and to identify the molecular factors underlying genetic variation. the combination of forward genetic approaches  with functional genomics and enzymology allowed the description of the complex regulation of an anthocyanin-o-methyltansferase gene cluster as a major player for the control of anthocyanin methylation in grape.

RESULTS
variation in methylated anthocyanin content
in order to investigate the genetic bases of anthocyanin methylation, three plant collections were analyzed:  a syrah × grenache  progeny of  <dig> genotypes replicated in two blocks,  a collection of  <dig> colored genotypes from the vassal germplasm collection , and  a subset of  <dig> genotypes selected to optimally represent the diversity in anthocyanin methylation level of the original  <dig> individuals sample with a smaller number of individuals . anthocyanin composition differed dramatically both in the sxg progeny  and in the collection of natural diversity . after a log-transformation, distribution of methylated anthocyanin  was normal in the three samples . the sxg progeny showed extensive variation in levels of mt, ranging from 50% to 97% of methylated anthocyanins with a mt variance of σ2mt sxg =  <dig>  . the collection of  <dig> colored grape varieties  showed variation ranging from 31% to 97% of methylated anthocyanins with a mt variance of σ2mt  <dig> cv =  <dig> . the variance was increased to σ2mt  <dig> cv =  <dig>  in the core-coll  <dig> cv.

qtl mapping of anthocyanin methylation level
qtl detection was performed either on the two field blocks taken separately or combined using a multi-trait procedure. in both cases, this allowed the consistent identification of two qtls for the anthocyanin methylation level. the first qtl, explaining 27% of the phenotypic variance for anthocyanin methylation, was located on linkage group  <dig>  between the markers vmc5g <dig> and vmc8c <dig> . this qtl was detected on the syrah parental map and supported with a maximum lod of  <dig>  for the multi-trait detection. it was also detected on both blocks taken separately. this qtl, which colocalized with a qtl previously identified as controlling the content of anthocyanins in grape berry  <cit> , corresponded to the vvmyba genes cluster, thus controlling together anthocyanin methylation and total accumulation. the second qtl was identified on lg <dig> of the grenache parental map between markers vmc9e <dig> and vmc8e <dig>  explaining up to 20% of the phenotypic variance with a maximum lod of  <dig>  . in the present study, we focused on this second qtl, which was specific to anthocyanin methylation. the marker pomt <dig>  the closest to the lg <dig> qtl, showed a difference of  <dig> % between homozygous combination of alleles leading to high level of mt and heterozygous combination at pomt <dig> leading to low level of mt .

candidate genes selection in the qtl on lg1
the physical interval of  <dig> mbp surrounding the maximum lod of the qtl of lg <dig> encompassed  <dig> predicted unigenes with an identity score superior to  <dig> . among this unigenes set, a cluster of three genes encoding putative anthocyanin o-methyltransferases  within a  <dig> kbp region was identified, referred to hereafter as vvaomt <dig>  vvaomt <dig> and vvaomt <dig> . vvaomt <dig> encoded a protein that is identical to the aomt from syrah shown to methylate anthocyanin both in vitro and in planta  <cit>  and similar to the faomt from cabernet sauvignon shown to methylate anthocyanin in vitro  <cit> ; therefore, we narrowed the study to these three candidate genes. the three genes have similar structures, with five small exons ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp and four introns . the deduced amino acid sequences of the three omts showed high sequence similarity  with a minimum pairwise identity score of 90% at the genomic level and of 96% at the transcript level. in addition, there was no other protein showing more than  <dig> amino acids with 80% similarity to aomt in the grape genome, showing evidence for vvaomt being a single family of paralogs. the corresponding transcripts were  <dig> bp long and very similar to vvaomt <dig>  all three genes were thus potentially functional. the 3' non-coding ends of vvaomt genes appeared less conserved than the coding region, and the only robust distinction between the three isogenes thus relied on divergent non-coding 3' ends. isogene-specific primers could be designed for vvaomt <dig> and vvaomt <dig> cdna, but not for vvaomt <dig> cdna, due to sequence homology with the two other isogenes and a shorter 3' end. using specific primers for vvaomt <dig>  no expression could be detected in mature berries of syrah, joubertin and petit bouschet, suggesting that this isogene was not expressed in mature red berries . although this does not demonstrate the non-functionality of vvaomt <dig>  it justified the further consideration of vvaomt <dig> and vvaomt <dig>  as candidate genes in association genetic analysis both expressed in mature berries.

effect of the vvaomt and vvmyba expression on methylated anthocyanins
to assess the relative influence of vvaomt and vvmyba genes, which potentially underlie the qtls on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively, we measured their respective transcript accumulation in the core-coll  <dig> cv, maximizing the diversity for methylated anthocyanins. we analyzed the level of expression of vvaomt , which combines the expression of the three isogenes vvaomt <dig>  vvaomt <dig> and vvaomt <dig> and of vvmyba , which combines the expression of the two isogenes vvmyba <dig> and vvmyba <dig>  both eaomt and emyba appeared to follow continuous variation among the  <dig> cultivars, showing no evidence of regulation by a single major polymorphism. eaomt appeared to be highly correlated with the methylated anthocyanin content of the berry skin . emyba appeared correlated with total anthocyanin content, but not with the methylated anthocyanin content . finally, the methylated anthocyanin content was better predicted when the effects of eaomt and emyba were considered jointly in a multivariate regression model , suggesting that the expression level of both genes had an effect on anthocyanin methylation, probably with a direct influence of eaomt and an indirect influence of emyba.

association mapping with vvaomt <dig> and vvaomt2
to isolate the particular effect of the two vvaomt candidate genes, we partially sequenced both genes in the collection of  <dig> colored varieties . this allowed detecting polymorphisms on genomic dna in the two last exons and in the 3'utr specifically for both vvaomt candidates . on vvaomt <dig>  we identified  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels, and, on vvaomt <dig>  we identified  <dig> snps and  <dig> indel, giving rise to  <dig> non-synonymous mutations. we tested the association of these polymorphisms with the level of methylated anthocyanins using the emma software  <cit> . six snps were identified as associated with variation in anthocyanin methylation in vvaomt <dig> and none in vvaomt <dig>  the significantly associated polymorphisms with p-value <  <dig>  and the test statistics are presented in table  <dig>  snp y <dig> did not change the amino acid sequence of the gene, and the five other associated polymorphisms were located in the 3'utr part of the vvaomt <dig> gene, thus not affecting the protein structure. all six associated snps showed significant ld, with one ld block, including snps y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and w <dig> , and another ld block, including m <dig> and indel <dig> . however, given the high level of polymorphism at both loci, we expected that if there was functional variation elsewhere in the vvaomt <dig> sequence, we would have genotyped at least one snp significantly associated through ld with the causal variation. in addition to the two blocks of ld reported for vvaomt <dig>  two blocks of high ld were identified on vvaomt <dig> . however, no intergenic ld was significant between vvaomt <dig> and vvaomt <dig>  showing a rapid decay of ld in the genomic fragment including these genes. as vvaomt <dig> was the only isogene showing polymorphism association with anthocyanin methylation level, we only retained vvaomt <dig> as candidate gene.

tests were performed using genomic dna sequence fragments in the coll  <dig> cv and coding dna sequence in the core-coll  <dig> cv. only the significant tests are shown. df: degree of freedom, r2: percentage of explained variance

specific expression of vvaomt2
isogene-specific primers were designed to measure the specific expression of the candidate gene vvaomt <dig> in  myba <dig> transformed grapevine hairy roots accumulating anthocyanin  <cit>  and in  the core-coll  <dig> cv . as we did not succeed in designing specific primers for aomt <dig>  we could only compare the global expression eaomt  using non specific primers with the specific expression vvaomt <dig>  in hairy roots over-expressing myba <dig>  the expression of vvaomt <dig> showed a  <dig> -fold increase compared to the control, while the level of eaomt, showed a 75-fold increase . although the effect of vvmyba <dig> on vvaomt <dig> cannot be neglected, these results suggest that the effect of vvmyba <dig> on vvaomt <dig> is limited. in the  <dig> cultivars subcore-collection, no significant correlation was found between the expression level of vvaomt <dig> and the ratio of methylated anthocyanins. moreover, no significant effect of emyba was observed on the expression of vvaomt <dig> . however, even if the specific expression level of vvaomt <dig> is correlated with global eaomt  and has a significant regulatory effect of eaomt on the level of methylation, in the absence of correlation between vvaomt <dig> expression and mt, we concluded that vvaomt <dig> expression had no direct regulatory effect on anthocyanin methylation.

sequence analysis of the vvaomt <dig> gene
we fully sequenced the vvaomt <dig> cdna of the core-coll  <dig> cv and identified  <dig> polymorphisms in the orf, including  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels . as the genomic and cdna fragments sequenced for vvaomt <dig> partially overlapped,  <dig> were common to those already identified in the  <dig> cultivars sample, including the  <dig> most associated snps presented in table  <dig>  this new polymorphism set was tested again for association with methylated anthocyanin level in the core-coll  <dig> cv and only three associations were found to be significant: y <dig> was again strongly associated, as well as two new snps, y <dig> and w <dig>  these three snps showed complete linkage disequilibrium  and their effects were thus confounded. in addition, the vvomt <dig> sequence for the parents of the sxg population showed to be homozygous for the strong allele of w <dig> and y <dig> in the syrah parent and heterozygous in the grenache parent, following the same segregation as the pomt <dig> marker. this supported that the grenache qtl on lg <dig> could be attributed to the segregation of vvomt <dig> alleles in the mapping population.

finally, in the best model including only expression profiles, eaomt explained 31% of the variance while the single snp y <dig> or w <dig> in the association model explained 43% of variance for the same sample . this strong effect was associated with a highly significant difference in anthocyanin methylation between the groups carrying the strong or the weak allele at snps y <dig> and w <dig> . the snps y <dig> and w <dig> corresponded to non-synonymous changes affecting the primary structure of the aomt protein. y <dig> led to a substitution from h to y in position  <dig> of the amino acid chain and w <dig> led to a substitution from s to t in position  <dig> of the amino acid chain. y <dig> appeared to generate a mutation within the second α-helix of the predicted protein secondary structure and w <dig>  within the sixth predicted α-helix.

characterization of the allelic variants of vvaomt2
two grape varieties were selected for the homozygous presence of contrasting snps y <dig> and w <dig> at the vvaomt <dig> locus, representing two allelic variants of the corresponding aomt <dig> protein. 'petit bouschet × aramon n°4'  presented the weak alleles t at y <dig> and a at w <dig> and 'papadiko'  presented the strong alleles c at y <dig> and t at w <dig>  no other difference was detected in the coding region. enzymatic tests performed with pb-aomt <dig> and pk-aomt <dig> indicated that both enzymes catalyzed in vitro the 3' o-methylation of anthocyanins with a catechol b-ring  and the 3' and 5' o-methylation for those showing a pyrogallol  b-ring. however detailed analysis of pb-aomt <dig> and pk-aomt <dig> activity revealed substrate-specific differences in catalytic efficiency . indeed, when cy 3-glc was used as a substrate, both pb-aomt <dig> and pk-aomt <dig> appeared to catalyze equally well the methylation of cy 3-glc into pn 3-glc. by contrast, when dp 3-glc was used as a substrate, pb-aomt <dig> showed a significantly reduced efficiency compared to pk-aomt <dig> in producing pt 3-glc . finally, both enzymes were able to convert dp 3-glc in mv 3-glc with similar efficiency although in small proportion.

discussion
combining molecular physiology and genetics to dissect complex traits in plants
major steps forward in the study of plant anthocyanin synthesis were made through molecular physiology and forward genetics experiments  <cit> . however, qtl and association mapping techniques have also proven to be relevant tools in the dissection of complex physiological traits, in particular for anthocyanin metabolism  <cit> . since their large scale application in maize, only a few attempts to clone and validate the polymorphisms of the genes underlying variation have been successful  <cit> . in this work, we propose different approaches to draw a global picture of the regulation of anthocyanin methylation in grape. as a starting point, we performed a rational sampling of highly diversified phenotypes present in the vassal germplasm repository  by using the m-method  <cit> . this method ensures the optimal capture of phenotypic diversity suitable to detect contrasted genetic effects. the use of qtl mapping and the colocalization of a vvaomt cluster on chromosome  <dig>  provided independent evidence supporting that the vvaomt genes may play a key role in determining the level of methylated anthocyanins in grape. the availability of broad genetic resources together with the use of grape genomic tools  <cit>  helped refine our qtl detection through gene expression and association mapping studies, demonstrating the likely involvement of both cis-regulation and newly characterized allelic variation in shaping a complex phenotype.

the pleiotropic influence of vvmyba genes
the qtl for mt level detected on lg <dig>  co-localized with a vvmyba genes cluster, supporting that vvmyba genes have an important effect on anthocyanin methylation. the results found in previous work with the same experimental design  <cit>  showed nonetheless that this region better explained the total anthocyanin content  than the level of methylated anthocyanins. this suggested that this qtl, cosegregating with vvmyba genes cluster, mostly had an effect on total anthocyanin accumulation and by consequence, an indirect effect on anthocyanin methylation. the vvmyba genes control the transcription of key genes of the late steps of the anthocyanin biosynthesis: ufgt and aomt  <cit> . our study showed that vvmyba <dig> has a significant effect on global vvaomts expression level. vvufgt catalyzes the glycosyl transfer on c <dig> of the anthocyanidin aglycone  <cit> . vvaomt catalyzes the methylation of dp 3-glc into both pt 3-glc and mv 3-glc, and that of cy 3-glc into pn 3-glc  <cit> . this pleiotropic effect of the vvmyba locus explains the relationship between the amount and the nature of the synthesized anthocyanins. this effect could also explain why black grape berries always contain large amounts of malvidin, the most methylated form of anthocyanidins  <cit> . ufgt and aomt genes showed similar expression profiles  <cit>  and to date, polymorphisms in their sequence were never associated with variation in anthocyanin content  <cit> . thus, these genes were considered so far to be purely cis-regulated and to have no regulatory control on the anthocyanin pathway.

determining the influence of vvaomt genes independently of vvmyba genes
we intended to identify regulation factors specific to the anthocyanin methylation level and independent of the total anthocyanin content. the mt variable and the total anthocyanin content were statistically independent, so the cosegregation of the qtls for the two traits and the correlation between the vvmyba <dig> expression and mt were thus strictly due to biological effects. nonetheless, genes specifically inducing differences in anthocyanin composition should either be independent of the expression of vvmyba or show trans-regulation or structural variation associated with anthocyanin methylation. in the search for such specific factors of the anthocyanin methylation process, the key was to find elements of variation that were significantly independent of the global anthocyanin vvmyba cis-regulated channel. recently, a similar example was shown in ipomoea for a dihydroxyflavonol reductase  where duplicated genes escaped the control network for greater adaptation  <cit> . we might also suspect this to be the case of vvaomt <dig> and anthocyanin methylation.

the vvaomt genes cluster, the fate of a duplicated gene family
grape varieties accumulating only non-methylated anthocyanins have never been described  <cit>  and were also not identified in our study on a very diverse sample, necessarily involving the persistency of functional aomt in the grape genome. two mechanisms can generate such a pattern: a strong selective constraint on aomt activity and a functional redundancy limiting the effect of deleterious mutations at vvaomt locus. we identified  <dig> candidate genes encoding omts located on chromosome  <dig> in the confidence interval of the qtl, potentially all coding for functional proteins, which supports initial functional redundancy. in three genotypes with very contrasting mt phenotypes, only vvaomt <dig> and vvaomt <dig> were expressed in mature grape berries, no expression of vvaomt <dig> being detected. the total expression of vvaomt  showed a high correlation with the level of methylation, while the specific expression of vvaomt <dig> did not. we may thus hypothesize that vvaomt <dig> is cis-regulated by the vvmyba genes, as reported in ageorges et al.  <cit>  and cutanda-perez et al.  <cit> , and broadly determines the level of methylated anthocyanins. conversely, vvaomt <dig> expression was only marginally affected by vvmyba genes and showed structural variation, affecting anthocyanin methylation: the functional redundancy is decreasing as mutations accumulate. although many other elements of variation may be involved in anthocyanin methylation, we may hypothesize a model as follows: vvaomt <dig> is the fundamental isogene for anthocyanin methylation under strict functional constraint, while vvaomt <dig> undergoing lesser functional constraint is responsible for fine and specific differences in the level of methylated anthocyanins .

the complex base of anthocyanin methylation in grape
previous works in petunia and grape suggested that different omts were responsible for the o-methylation of anthocyanins at either 3' or 5' positions  <cit> . in contrast, hugueney et al.  <cit>  identified a bifunctional aomt catalyzing 3' and 5' o-methylation, suggesting that aomt alone would be sufficient to perform both methylation steps in grape berries. in this study, we showed that the two proteins encoded by allelic variants of vvaomt <dig> were also able to perform in vitro 3' or 3',5' methylation on cy 3-glc and dp 3-glc but in addition, we identified two snps associated with variation in the level of methylated anthocyanins. we showed that this polymorphism led to changes in substrate-specific catalytic efficiency, which only affects dp 3-glc methylation into pt 3-glc. differential 3' o-methylation on trihydroxylated anthocyanin substrate due to protein variants may explain the quantitative differences observed in planta, after removing the effect of vvaomt <dig>  furthermore, the comparison with the aomt <dig> and faomt characterized previously  <cit>  showed that aomt <dig> variants characterized in this study tend to produce a lower proportion of mv 3-glc, with a preferential catalysis of the 3' o-methylation. indeed, both aomt <dig> variants synthesized the same low relative proportion of mv 3-glc  while in similar conditions, aomt <dig> was able to synthesize up to 34% of mv 3-glc  <cit> . finally, variation in catalytic properties together with potential differential expression is definitely capable of creating the complex pattern of methylated anthocyanin variation we observe in different grapes cultivars.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this work was to identify and quantify the effect of molecular factors controlling the variation of anthocyanin methylation in grape by combining genetic mapping and functional study. most previous studies regarding the accumulation of anthocyanin in grape have pointed to the main involvement of the vvmyba locus  <cit> . our findings confirmed the effect of this locus, but we made an important step forward by revealing the influence of novel factors other than myb type genes involved in variation of anthocyanin composition. we quantitatively assessed the effect of the vvaomt genes cluster on anthocyanin methylation. furthermore, we identified new gene variants encoding proteins with slight differences in catalytic properties from other aomts described so far, showing allele-guided substrate specificity. this study improves our knowledge on how differences in methylated anthocyanin level may exist independently of total anthocyanin content. the relative independence of these two traits is possible because of the partial functional redundancy between the vvaomt isogenes, among which vvaomt <dig> "escaped" the control of vvmyba. finally, with a relaxed functional constraint on vvaomt <dig> while vvaomt <dig> is still ensuring the persistency of the activity, variation could arise, giving rise to novel phenotypes.
