BACKGROUND
fungi are a remarkably successful group of eukaryotes that play an essential part in our ecosystem as symbionts and decomposers of organic material  <cit> . on the other hand, numerous fungi are devastating human and plant pathogens that are a serious threat to agricultural industry and human health  <cit> . in addition, some fungi serve as simple eukaryotic model systems for basic cell biology questions, as they are closely related to animal cells  <cit>  and share important cellular processes. in this respect, the most prominent fungal model system is the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. its genomic sequence was among the first published in  <dig>  <cit>  and more than 77% of the ~ <dig> genes are assigned to cellular functions  <cit> . however, this powerful model has its limitations, because certain basic processes found in animal cells, such as long-distance transport along the microtubule cytoskeleton or the removal of the nuclear envelope in mitosis do not exist in budding yeast  <cit> . in recent years, large scale sequencing projects were launched in order to obtain genome sequences from over  <dig> additional fungi  <cit> . among the recently released genomes is that of the basidiomycete u. maydis  <cit> , which is also known as a smut fungus on corn. beside its pathogenic lifestyle and numerous technical advantages of this fungus, the recently published manually annotated proteome, which is available on the public server of the munich information center for protein sequences  established this fungus as a powerful model system for molecular phytopathology  <cit> . however, u. maydis also has a long standing history as a cell biological model system and important basic concepts, such as the molecular mechanism of dna recombination .

recently, the importance of u. maydis as a model system increased, as studies on the microtubule cytoskeleton in polar growth and mitosis revealed that important processes are conserved between u. maydis and mammalians. such processes are not found in the model fungus s. cerevisiae  <cit> . among these are kinesin-1- and kinesin-3-based transport processes  <cit> , both of which motors are not found in the budding yeast. another striking example is the removal of the nuclear envelope in mitosis. in contrast to budding yeast, the nuclear envelope is removed at the onset of mitosis in humans  <cit>  and in u. maydis  <cit> . furthermore, in both organisms this is accompanied by the disassembly of the nuclear pores and the recruitment of some pore components to the mitotic chromosomes  <cit> . interestingly, the mechanistically parallels are reflected by unexpected high sequence conservation of pore components  <cit> . this strongly suggests that sequence conservation between humans and u. maydis coincides with functional similarity. these data indicate that u. maydis and mammalian cells share common cellular processes and the underlying molecular machinery that are not found in s. cerevisiae. in order to investigate this further, we made use of the simap  database, which is based on a smith-waterman pair-wise comparison of all known predicted protein sequences available  <cit> . using this bioinformatic resource we analyzed the manually annotated proteome set of u. maydis and s. cerevisiae and the currently accessible protein information of homo sapiens. surprisingly, we found that the proteome of u. maydis is more closely related to humans than to the fungal cousin s. cerevisiae. using the funcat database that summarizes predicted protein function  <cit> , we demonstrate that many proteins conserved in h. sapiens and u. maydis can be assigned to certain cellular process. however, a large portion of these proteins are of unknown function. this indicates that essential, yet undiscovered processes are conserved between u. maydis and humans.

RESULTS
in a first step we compared general sequence characteristics in coding regions of u. maydis, s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens using the fungal mips genre databases  <cit>  and human data from the ensembl database  <cit> . this included standard parameters, such as the average gene density or gene size . in most of the analyzed parameters, including exon size, percent of coding region and average gene density, both fungi are closely related. next, we did pair-wise comparisons of the whole proteome of u. maydis against s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens. for that a java client stand-alone application was developed that was used to access the simap retrieval layer . in this analysis, similarity in pair-wise comparison of proteins was indicated by the "e-value" or "% identity over the length of the protein" and the median of these analyses was calculated. surprisingly, we found that both median values were higher in the u. maydis-to-h. sapiens set compared to the u. maydis-to-s. cerevisiae analysis . in contrast, when the proteome of s. cerevisiae was compared with u. maydis and h. sapiens, the expected outcome was that both fungi are more closely related than the budding yeast to humans . these results added further support to our initial assumption that u. maydis contains additional proteins that are highly conserved to humans, but that are absent from the fungal cousin s. cerevisiae.

¶ the predicted number increases to  <dig> when including splice variants.

its general assumed that sequence conservation in proteins is a consequence of a similar function. however, even unrelated sequences show a certain degree of similarity, which increases in structural motifs such as coiled-coil domains that are found in ~20% of all proteins in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . in order to determine the level of random sequence similarity, we compared unrelated proteins, including tbp , myosin i  and fer <dig>  of u. maydis against each other. this analysis indicated that random sequence conservation reaches 1– <dig> % identity. next, we selected functionally unrelated proteins that contain coiled-coil regions . a comparison of these proteins against each other revealed up to  <dig> % sequence identity in those proteins that contained extended coiled-coil stretches . consequently, we considered only protein identity that was 20% or higher as indication for functional conservation, a value that corresponds with previous reports that conserved protein function is indicated by at least 18–20% protein sequence identity  <cit> . following this criterion we redid our analysis and found that around  <dig> proteins are shared by all three organisms , which represents 25–28% of the proteome of both fungi. surprisingly, both fungi share  <dig> proteins, suggesting that only a minor portion  of the proteome is fungal specific. in contrast, u. maydis has  <dig> proteins that are more conserved in humans than in budding yeast, whereas s. cerevisiae shares only  <dig> proteins with h. sapiens. this again indicates that u. maydis is more closely related to humans than to its fungal cousin. however, a strict cut off at 20% could be misleading, as slight differences in sequence conservation around this border will not be recognized. in other words, a protein that has  <dig> % identity between both fungi and  <dig> % identity in humans would be considered as fungal specific. moreover, a protein that shares 80% identity between both fungi, but only  <dig> % with human will also not be identified. in order to cope with these problems, we included a more stringent criterion for our analysis and considered only those proteins that share ≥ 20% identity in two organisms, but found at ≥ 10% identity in the third partner. in this approach u. maydis still shares  <dig> fungal specific proteins with s. cerevisiae, but it has an even larger set of  <dig> proteins in common with h. sapiens . on the other hand, only  <dig> proteins of s. cerevisiae had a conserved counterpart in the human genome .

¶ % identity over entire protein length to unrelated coiled-coil proteins

the results presented so far were based on a 20% identity over the total protein length. however, many proteins perform specific functions at short domains and functional orthologues might be overlooked when comparing whole proteins. a striking example is the microtubule plus-end binding protein clip <dig> in u. maydis. it was shown that this protein binds to microtubule plus-ends and contains a cap-glu domain and two zinc finger domains  <cit> . all these features are also typical for the human orthologue clip <dig>  <cit> . however, the overall sequence identity between clip <dig> and clip <dig> is only at  <dig> %, and significant sequence conservation is only found in the cap-glu domain . therefore, we considered it likely that our analysis has not covered all functional orthologues between the three organisms. thus, we extended our analysis and compared sequences at a lower limit of  <dig> aa sequence overlap, which would cover short domains such as the fha-domain in kinesin- <dig>  or the mentioned cap-glu domain in clip <dig>  and applied the same criterion as before . this approach identified an additional  <dig> proteins being conserved between u. maydis and humans , and  <dig> in case of a comparison of u. maydis and s. cerevisiae. the number of proteins conserved between humans and budding yeast increased by  <dig> additional proteins .

taken both analyses together our bioinformatic approach revealed  <dig> homologues between u. maydis and humans. in order to better define the orthology relationship among these genes we next performed a best bidirectional hit analysis assuming that orthologous proteins would identify the partner when searching in both directions. making use of the simap database we found that  <dig> proteins  fulfil this criterion . thus, our data suggest that ~10% of the u. maydis proteins have a role in cellular processes that are most likely conserved in the human cell. on the other hand, budding yeast and humans share  <dig> unique proteins and yeast and u. maydis have  <dig> proteins in common . the most obvious next question therefore was whether theses proteins can be grouped in functional clusters. in order to address this question, we made use of the functional catalogue database  that summarizes functional annotation for proteomes from different organisms by assigning proteins of interest to certain cellular processes. in addition, our method provides a p-value that correlates the presence of proteins in the set to the expected abundance of proteins in the same functional groups in the proteome. we first analyzed proteins that are exclusively shared by both fungi and focused on those proteins, which are overrepresented in certain functional categories, whereas proteins that have a functional annotation but are not enriched in functional classes are not listed . according to our expectation, u. maydis and s. cerevisiae have proteins in common that are essential for their uni-cellular life style. this includes the detoxification machineries and proteins that are involved in spore formation . in addition, both organisms contain  <dig> proteins that do not fall in any functional category and are therefore classified as "unknown function" the second set consists of proteins found in humans and u. maydis and also represents numerous cellular processes, including amino acid degradation, oxidation of fatty acids, mrna splicing and modification, protein modification and degradation and g-protein mediated signalling . however, about one third of all proteins in this set  are neither found in the funcat nor in clusters of eukaryotic orthologous groups in the cogs database  <cit> ;  <cit> , indicating that their function is not yet known . finally, we analyzed the s. cerevisiae-to-h. sapiens homology set and again found some cellular processes, including trna modification, secondary biosynthesis and protein fate and modification that are overrepresented in this protein set . in contrast to the previous comparison, only  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins that are unique for yeast and human were without functional prediction in funcat or the cogs database.

*note that proteins can appear in more than one functional category. in addition, numerous proteins are assigned to additional functional classes that are not listed.

our analysis revealed that u. maydis and human share numerous proteins, and analysis of these might give insights into the molecular basis of human diseases. a good example for such a role for u. maydis is the analysis of the breast cancer susceptibility gene brca <dig> that confers a high risk of breast cancer and is the focus of cancer research since its discovery in the mid 1990s  <cit> . the activity of brca <dig> is not well-understood, which might in part be due to the fact that it was not found in the model system s. cerevisiae. recently a brca <dig> homologue  was identified in a screen for dna-repair defective mutants  <cit> , and it was shown that brh <dig> enables recombinational dna repair by controlling rad <dig>  <cit> . indeed, the u. maydis rad <dig> is one of seven proteins that are implied in dna repair and that are part of the  <dig> proteins identified to be highly conserved in humans and u. maydis. in order to gain insights into a role of u. maydis genes in human diseases we used the genetic association database  <cit> , which is an archive of all published knowledge of molecular disorders in humans. after adjusting the nomenclature  all proteins that matched were analyzed and then classified according to main disease classes. this analysis revealed that  <dig> proteins of the u. maydis-to-h. sapiens set are implicated in diseases, including cancer , cardiovascular disorders  and defects in metabolism . in addition,  <dig> proteins  were found that are implicated in various defined diseases or whose roles are not yet understood . among these proteins are prominent oncogenes such as ercc <dig>  and ercc <dig> , which participate in excision repair of dna, and when mutated cause various types of cancer, including non-small-cell lung cancer  <cit> . another example is the kras protein , the gtp/gtp-binding protein acting in intracellular signal transduction  that also is involved in cancer formation. most interesting, we found several disease-related proteins that most likely are not present in the model system s. cerevisiae . this group includes acadm  and acads , which encode acyl-coa dehydrogenases . mutants in these genes cause medium-chain-acyl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency  <cit>  and short-chain-acyl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency in humans  <cit> .

finally, it is important to note that the yeast s. cerevisiae also shares  <dig> disease-related proteins with humans that are significantly less conserved in u. maydis , and  <dig> of these proteins are not present in u. maydis . interestingly, a third of all disease-related proteins in yeast are involved in diabetes. among these is adipor <dig> , an adiponectin receptor, which when deleted in mice promotes type  <dig> diabetes  <cit>  and pygl , which when mutated causes glycogen phosphorylase deficiency, resulting in diabetes mellitus type  <dig> in humans  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
fungal model systems, such as s. cerevisiae have greatly enhanced our knowledge of basic cell biology, which is in part due to numerous technical advantages and the published genome. however, some cellular processes that are important in humans are highly modified or are not even present in this fungus. examples are microtubule-based transport that is essential in elongated neurons, but virtually absent from s. cerevisiae. consequently, some proteins, such as the motor proteins kinesin- <dig> and kinesin- <dig> are not encoded by the genome of the budding yeast. experimental evidence from work in u. maydis indicated that this fungus could fill in this gap. this organism has a long history as a model system for dna repair and recombination, and shows additional similarities to human cells, such as long-distance transport and an open mitosis. consequently, proteins like kinesin- <dig> and kinesin- <dig> are present and are highly conserved in u. maydis. indeed, as much as ~10% of all u. maydis proteins have highly conserved counterparts in humans, but are not found or are significant less conserved in yeast. on the first glimpse this finding is surprising. however, genomic data indicate that fungi are an extremely divers taxon that covers around one billion years of divergent evolution  <cit> . the unexpectedly high conservation between u. maydis and humans might suggest that both organisms share some conserved cellular processes. however, it is important to note that functional predictions based on sequence homology can just be a first step towards an understanding of the cellular function. careful experimental work is needed to further prove that u. maydis helps understanding the molecular basis of human diseases.
