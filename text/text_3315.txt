BACKGROUND
the vomeronasal organ  is a paired tubular organ that is found in the nasal cavity of most tetrapods  <cit> . it lies in the tissue on either side of the nasal septum, stretching along its sides towards the back of the nasal cavity. the vno is thought mainly to detect pheromones or pheromone blends  <cit> , but it also detects some environmental odors  <cit> . functioning of the vno requires functional receptor cells with connections to the brain and all parts of the receptor activation cascade. two families of vomeronasal receptors -v1rs and v2rs-are specific to the vno and the number of family members varies greatly between species  and the cow , for example, only have intact v1r genes and lack functional v2r genes  <cit> . both vomeronasal receptors are thought to use a common receptor activation cascade that depends on the transient receptor potential channel protein, subfamily c, member  <dig>   <cit> . trpc <dig> is one of seven known trpcs  <cit> . while the activation process is still not fully understood, the trpc <dig> channel is thought to be modulated through phospholipase c  <cit> . trpc <dig> represents its own gene subfamily as it is quite dissimilar to the other trpcs in sequence and function  <cit> . to date, full-length transcripts of trpc <dig> have been described for the mouse   <cit> , rat   <cit> , new world monkeys  <cit> , cow  <cit> , californian sea lion   <cit>  and zebrafish   <cit> , whereas trpc <dig> in human   <cit> , old world monkeys  <cit> , dolphin , little brown bat , flying fox   <cit> , fin whale , harbour seal  and river otter   <cit>  contains stop codons, indicating a disabled pseudogene. partial sequences of trpc <dig> have been characterised for the elephant shark  and sea lamprey  but not in non-vertebrate chordates such as lancelet  and sea squirt , suggesting that trpc <dig> was already present in the olfactory epithelium of the common ancestor of all vertebrates  <cit> .

in the rat vno, trpc <dig> is prominently and selectively localised to the microvilli of the receptor cells, which are thought to be the binding site of pheromones  <cit> . trpc <dig> is expressed strongly in the vno and in only a very small population of cells within the main olfactory epithelium   <cit> . mouse trpc <dig> is localised to the anterior part of the sperm head where it is thought to be involved in the acrosome reaction, as ca2+ entry and the acrosome reaction are both blocked by an antibody to trpc <dig>  <cit> . however, trpc2-/- null mutant mice are fertile, so the importance of trpc <dig> for the acrosome reaction is in doubt  <cit> . trpc2-/- mice do, however, provide dramatic evidence for the importance of trpc <dig> in vno function  <cit> . trpc2-/- male mice fail to initiate attack behavior at the approach of an intruding male and fail to establish a rank order  <cit> . trpc2-/- males also mount other males far more than normal males do. trpc2-/- null mutant mice show not only a change in behaviour  <cit> , but also exhibit differential hypotrophy of the glomerular layer of the aob, with the anterior portion of the glomerular layer  resembling that of wild-type mice, and the posterior portion  reduced or absent  <cit> .

vannier et al.  <dig>  <cit>  identified two transcripts of mtrpc <dig>  that were exclusively expressed in testis, whereas a later study  <cit>  failed to find these two transcripts but described two shorter transcripts called mtrpc2α and mtrpc2β. the predicted proteins encoded by mtrpc2α and mtrpc2β lacked the n-termini of mtrpc2a and mtrpc2b and resembled more rat trpc <dig> and other trpc proteins. mtrpc2β was found to be strongly expressed in the vno and only weakly expressed in testis, suggesting it may represent the more biologically relevant variant.

as trpc <dig> is relatively conserved among species  in contrast to v1r or v2r genes , it is more suited for investigating the evolution of the vnr pathway in vertebrates and especially in mammals. to date, trpc <dig> has only been studied in eutherian mammals but not in marsupials or monotremes. further data may reveal whether a longer transcript also exists in species other than mouse or whether the shorter transcript mtrpc2β is more similar to other species as described in rat. using genome sequence data from two divergent marsupials, the tammar wallaby  and the gray short-tailed opossum , we analysed the trpc <dig> locus of marsupials and compared it to that of other vertebrates. we also include an analysis of this locus in another divergent mammal, the platypus . by a combination of cdna cloning, expression analysis and bioinformatics, we show that the locus orthologous to mouse trpc <dig> is comprised of two distinct genes that are regulated independently.

RESULTS
the trpc <dig> locus is comprised of two independently regulated genes
in order to investigate the presence of trpc <dig> orthologues in marsupials, we performed blast searches of genomic databases of the grey short-tailed opossum and the tammar. the longest murine trpc <dig> transcript  contains  <dig> exons, with the coding sequence spanning exons 2- <dig> . sequences orthologous to all murine coding exons were identified in the genomes of both tammar and opossum. for both species, splice donor and acceptors sites were identified for all coding exons with the exception of the 3' donor site of exon  <dig> and the 5' acceptor site of exon  <dig>  retention of the intron between exons  <dig> and  <dig> was predicted to result in a truncated protein. nevertheless, exons 12- <dig> of both marsupial species had an uninterrupted open reading frame .

to elucidate the splicing arrangement of trpc <dig> transcripts in the tammar, rt-pcr was performed on adult female vno-derived cdna. rt-pcr using primers specific to exons  <dig>  and  <dig>  produced two faint bands of slightly differing size . this pcr was used as a template for several nested pcrs to amplify fragments of trpc <dig> cdna. using nested primers specific to exons  <dig>  and  <dig> , one fragment was cloned that was sequenced and found to represent exons 2- <dig> and 13- <dig> in contiguity ). pcr using nested primers specific to exons  <dig>  and  <dig>  yielded two more cloned products of differing size. sequencing of the first of these showed it to represent exons 2- <dig> and 12- <dig> in contiguity ). sequencing of the second clone showed it to be similar to the first except that exon  <dig> was longer  and that exon  <dig> was omitted ).

the predicted orfs of all three of the above clones would result in substantially truncated proteins. because we were unable to amplify any products containing putative exons  <dig> and/or  <dig>  an additional rt-pcr was performed using primers specific to exon  <dig>  and the 3' part of exon  <dig> . this resulted in a cloned fragment representing exons 6- <dig> but including intronic sequence between exons  <dig> and  <dig> ). sequence from this clone also encoded a predicted truncated protein. from our rt-pcr results and the apparent absence of appropriate splice sites, we conclude that in marsupials no intron is ever spliced out between the regions orthologous to murine exons  <dig> and  <dig> 

the conservation of predicted amino acid sequence from both exons 2- <dig> and 12- <dig> suggested that both regions are functional but do not encode the same protein. evidence from previous reports  <cit>  suggested that a distinct promoter downstream of exons 2- <dig> drives expression of exons 12- <dig> specifically in the vno. in fact, in no species other than the mouse could we find any evidence for a transcript with a continuous orf that included both regions. we therefore compared expression by non-nested rt-pcr using primer pairs specific to each region. primers specific to exons  <dig>  and  <dig>  yielded two products ) from a broad range of adult tissues, whereas primers specific to exons  <dig>  and  <dig>  yielded a product only from adult vno .

we next examined the onset of vno-specific expression  in early tammar pouch young. because of the difficulty in separating vno from main olfactory epithelium  and other tissues in the nasal region of the smallest pouch young , we also tested markers of sensory neurons  and moe   <cit> ). rt-pcr product for exons 12- <dig> was detected strongly in the vno of day  <dig> and day  <dig> pouch young, very weakly in some earlier pouch young vno and moe samples and very weakly in adult liver and lung . detection of cnga <dig> in both vno and moe samples of some early pouch young suggested that there may have been cross-contamination of these tissues or that vno- and moe-specific receptor neurons have not fully differentiated from each other at these very early stages of development.

our results indicated that a second, vno-specific promoter lies upstream of tammar exon  <dig>  as previously postulated for the mouse  <cit> . we found that the putative first exon-"exon β"-of a mouse vno-specific transcript  <cit>  is also conserved in sequence upstream of exon  <dig> in the tammar wallaby as well as many other mammal species . rt-pcr of tammar vno-derived cdna using primers specific to exons β  and  <dig>  revealed a full-length open reading frame, represented by transcript e  .

the essential domains for trpc <dig> function, including the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, are encoded by exons β- <dig>  exons 2- <dig> were predicted to encode a protein with similarities to the n-terminal domain of xrcc <dig> . our expression and bioinformatic data indicate that the latter exons comprise a gene distinct from trpc <dig>  which we term xndr . murine xndr is therefore represented by murine transcript  . hence we refer to transcripts comprised of exons β- <dig> as representing trpc <dig> ) and transcripts encompassing both regions as representing xndr-trpc <dig> ). in the mouse, xndr-trpc <dig>  is thus encoded by transcripts initiated by the xndr promoter in which splicing occurs between the donor site of exon  <dig> and the acceptor site of exon  <dig>  whereas these splice sites are not used in transcripts that encode xndr.

xndr and trpc <dig> are both highly conserved among vertebrates
we examined the evolution of the xndr/trpc <dig> locus by comparing the assembled genomes of a broad range of vertebrate species available on the ucsc browser. orthologues of xndr appear to be present in all jawed vertebrates ranging from teleost fishes to mammals . however, we were unable to detect orthologues of xndr in lower deuterostomes such as lancelet and sea squirt, in which the closest homologues appear to represent orthologues of xrcc <dig> . in human and chimpanzee , the gene is disrupted, with exons 1- <dig> located approximately  <dig> mbp distant to exons 6- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> of both species. this is a relatively recent event, however, as all  <dig> exons are normally arranged in another hominid, the orangutan, as well as in other primates, with no disruption of the orf . the n-terminal region of xndr encoded by exons 2- <dig> is the more highly conserved  and presumably the more functionally important. thus the non-disrupted orf of exons 2- <dig> may still be functional in both human and chimpanzee.

trpc <dig> orthologues in human and other catarrhine primates have a disrupted orf, as previously reported  <cit> . in the chimpanzee, exons 12- <dig> appear to have been completely lost, while in the orangutan , a region corresponding to ~ <dig>  kb in human and containing exons 16- <dig> is deleted. in the rhesus macaque , all exons are present but exon  <dig> is inverted .

xndr and trpc <dig> flank each other in all species in which the relative positions of both genes could be determined, with the exception of the anole lizard  in which they occupy separate genomic scaffolds . the close proximity of xndr and trpc <dig> appears to be ancestral, as it is also found in teleost fishes . there is also a second homologue of trpc <dig>  located on chromosome  <dig> of the zebrafish genome that does not appear to be present in other teleost species.

xndr and trpc <dig> are differentially regulated in the platypus
to confirm that independent transcriptional regulation of trpc <dig> and xndr is conserved at least among mammals, we examined their expression in the platypus, one of the five living species of the third extant sub-order of mammals. sequences orthologous to exons 2- <dig>  representing the complete coding sequence of xndr, were identified in the platypus genome, along with exons β, exons 13- <dig>  exons 17- <dig> and part of exon  <dig> of trpc <dig> . although the platypus genome build is incomplete in this region, continuous sequence separates exons  <dig> and β, showing that trpc <dig> and xndr flank each other. forward primers designed within exons  <dig> and β and reverse primers designed within exons  <dig> and  <dig>  were used to test expression in adult tissues, including nasal tissue believed to contain the vno, by rt-pcr. platypus xndr  was detected in all tissues tested, whereas trpc <dig>  was only detected in nasal tissue and liver . the sequence of the latter gel-extracted product has been deposited in genbank . rt-pcr using the exon  <dig> forward primer and the exon  <dig> reverse primer did not yield any detectable product , suggesting that expression of an xndr-trpc <dig> transcript is low or absent in the platypus.

the therian trpc <dig> promoter contains a putative nhlh <dig> transcription factor binding site
to characterise the promoter that may be responsible for specific expression of trpc <dig> in the vomeronasal organ, we compared genomic sequence immediately upstream of the first exon  of trpc <dig> from a range of vertebrate species. when we compared those of mammals, two sites were identified as likely candidates: a hen <dig> site and a gc box . the former shows strong similarity to the consensus binding site for nhlh <dig> , a neural-specific basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor  <cit> . the hen <dig> site was well conserved among eutherians and marsupials, but not in the platypus  or in other vertebrates .

discussion
trpc <dig> was originally identified as encoding a vno neuron-specific ion channel in the rat  <cit> . this transcript  corresponds to the transcript that we define here as trpc <dig> proper. two subsequent reports, however, identified additional variants of murine "trpc2" transcript variants that were termed trpc2a, trpc2b  <cit> , trcpc2α and trpc2β  <cit> . trpc2β was isolated by race-pcr from vomeronasal tissue and corresponds to the original rat trpc <dig> transcript. each of the other transcripts included exons from xndr and, notably, was amplified from non-vno-derived cdna. the primers and methods used would have specifically favoured amplification of cdna fragments of xndr-trpc <dig>  rather than xndr or trpc <dig>  even if they were at low abundance. although hofmann et al  <cit>  reported that only trpc2β was specifically expressed in the vno and that two independent promoters are likely to be functional, until now there has been no formal recognition that xndr-trpc <dig> represents a fusion of two distinct genes and may be biologically irrelevant. at the time of preparing this manuscript, exons from both genes are still presented as defining "trpc2" by the entrez gene database on the ncbi website.

in this study, we have presented several pieces of evidence to support the recognition of two distinct genes-xndr and trpc <dig> - at this locus in mammals. first, splice sites necessary for the full-length orf of mouse xndr-trpc <dig> are not conserved in most other species, rendering it implausible that xndr-trpc <dig> has any conserved role among vertebrates. second, comparisons by rt-pcr using primers specific to either xndr or trpc <dig> in the tammar wallaby and the platypus clearly supported the original evidence  <cit>  that two independent promoters respectively regulate widespread  and vno-specific  expression. third, analysis of a range of vertebrate genomes shows that the two genes have evolved independently. in the anole lizard, xndr and trpc <dig> are both conserved but occupy separate genomic scaffolds. in the chicken, xndr is conserved whereas trpc <dig> appears to be lost, or at least does not flank xndr. in catarrhine primates, at least the first  <dig> coding exons of xndr are conserved and presumably functional, despite the loss of functionality of trpc <dig>  together, our data provide overwhelming evidence for identifying xndr as a novel gene distinct from trpc <dig>  xndr encodes a predicted protein with similarities to the n-terminal domain of xrcc <dig> . xrcc <dig> has a key role in dna base excision repair ; thus it is possible xndr has a similar role.

trpc <dig> expression was highly specific to the vno in the tammar, being highly expressed not only in the adult, but also in pouch young as early as day  <dig> post partum. expression was only weakly detected at earlier stages, possibly due to the small proportion of expressing cells. marsupials deliver highly altricial young that are equivalent to the eutherian fetus and complete most of their development post partum  <cit> . the surrounding tissue that was also dissected along with the vno at these earlier stages may have diluted the proportion of trpc <dig> transcripts in our samples. at birth, goα protein was confined to only a limited number of cells  <cit> . it thus seems likely that the vno does not begin to function until around day  <dig> post partum in the tammar. this would make the main olfactory system the primary candidate for perception of pouch odours that guide the neonatal tammar into the pouch at birth  <cit> . further studies will be needed to confirm whether the vno is functional earlier in development in these highly altricial young.

we identified nhlh <dig> as a candidate regulator of trpc <dig> expression. mouse nhlh <dig> is expressed specifically in the developing nervous system, peaking around the period of e <dig> to  <dig> , and marks early post-mitotic neuroblasts  <cit> . significantly, expression of nhlh <dig> becomes restricted during later stages to olfactory and vomeronasal receptor neurons  <cit> . mammalian nhlh <dig> and nhlh <dig> are encoded by paralogous genes and are almost identical in their c-terminal bhlh domain but highly divergent in their n-terminal domain  <cit> . murine nhlh <dig> is also expressed in the developing nervous system, peaking at around e <dig>   <cit> . in the ncbi unigene gene expression profile estimated by expressed sequence tag  frequency in adult tissues, expression of nhlh <dig>  but not nhlh <dig>  is highly restricted to the nasopharynx http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene/estprofileviewer.cgi?uglist=mm. <dig>  consistent with a specific role for nhlh <dig> in mammalian olfactory and vomeronasal receptor neurons. we therefore propose that nhlh <dig> specifically regulates trpc <dig> expression in vno receptor neurons in mammals. we also found conserved e-box consensus sequences in the trpc <dig> promoter of some teleost fishes , suggesting that other bhlh transcription factors may be involved in regulating trpc <dig> in other species. the genomes of teleost fishes only appear to contain an orthologue of nhlh <dig> but not nhlh <dig>  suggesting that nhlh <dig> represents the ancestral gene. both jawed and jawless fishes only have a single olfactory organ, but the genetic components of a vomeronasal sensory system are nevertheless present in both groups  <cit> . it is possible that the evolution of nhlh <dig> is linked to the evolution of a morphologically more complex olfactory system in the tetrapod lineage.

CONCLUSIONS
by a combination of expression analysis, genomic analysis and a critical assessment of previous literature, our study clearly demonstrates that the locus formerly defined as encompassing a single gene in reality comprises two distinct genes: xndr and trpc <dig>  this distinction is important for future studies, especially for those comparing vno function among divergent vertebrate species. xndr is broadly expressed and has a possible role in dna repair, while trpc <dig> is specifically expressed in the vno under the probable regulation of nhlh <dig>  the expression profile of trpc <dig> in the tammar wallaby suggests that there is no trpc2-dependent role for the vno during early pouch life.
