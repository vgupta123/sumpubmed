BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis  infections have been considered a major problem in the swine industry worldwide, particularly over the past  <dig> years. s. suis is a gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic coccus, and  <dig> serotypes  have been described based on their capsular antigens. among these, serotype  <dig>  is the causative agent of many different syndromes worldwide, including meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and pneumonia in humans, swine, and other animals  <cit> . in addition, ss <dig> is widely recognized as an important zoonotic agent that afflicts people in close contact with infected pigs or pork-derived products  <cit> . two recent large-scale outbreaks of human streptococcal toxic shock syndrome  caused by ss <dig> in china in  <dig> and in  <dig> have increased public health concerns worldwide. notably, a major outbreak of ss <dig> infection emerged in the summer of  <dig> in sichuan province, china. a total of  <dig> cases of human s. suis infection were reported, and the outbreak resulted in  <dig> deaths and massive economic losses  <cit> .

little is known about the virulence factors of ss <dig>  to date, only a few ss <dig> virulence associated factors have been identified and characterized; these include the capsular polysaccharide   <cit> , suilysin   <cit> , muramidase-released protein   <cit> , extracellular protein factor   <cit> , adhesin  <cit> , cell wall-associated and extracellular proteins  <cit> , fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein   <cit> , a serum opacity factor  <cit> , and the arginine deiminase system  <cit> .

an understanding of ss2-host molecular interactions is crucial for understanding ss <dig> pathogenesis and immunology. conventional genetic and biochemical approaches used to study ss <dig> virulence factors are unable to take into account in the complex and dynamic environmental stimuli associated with the infection process. recently, several technologies, including in vivo expression technology , differential fluorescence induction , signature-tagged mutagenesis , transcriptional and proteomic profiling, and in vivo-induced antigen technology  have been developed to identify the pathogen genes expressed during the infection process  <cit> .

iviat is a method that allows for the direct identification of microbial proteins expressed at sufficient levels during host infection to be immunogenic. a schematic of the iviat procedure was described by rollins et al  <cit> . the advantage of iviat is that it enables the identification of antigens expressed specifically during infection, but not during growth in standard laboratory media. it was speculated that the genes and gene pathways identified by iviat may play a role in virulence or pathogenesis during bacterial infection  <cit> . iviat has been successfully used to identify arrays of in vivo induced proteins in salmonella enterica serovar typhi  <cit> , escherichia coli o <dig>  <cit> , group a streptococcus   <cit> , vibrio cholerae  <cit> , and others, and these proteins have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis or virulence of the infecting organisms. when iviat was applied to e. coli o <dig>  it identified  <dig> o <dig> proteins expressed during human infection. among these, four proteins--intimin-γ , qsea , taga , and msbb <dig> --had been previously identified as virulence-related proteins  <cit> .

to identify ss <dig> proteins that are immunogenic and expressed uniquely during ss <dig> infection, we applied the newly developed and modified iviat method. briefly, we screened a library of ss <dig> proteins expressed in e. coli to identify clones that were immunoreactive with convalescent-phase sera, which had been previously fully adsorbed against in vitro-grown ss <dig> and e. coli organisms. the adsorption process eliminates antibodies reactive with in vitro-expressed antigens and allows for the identification of clones expressing protein antigens that are upregulated during swine infection. specifically, we hypothesized that by using iviat, we could identify proteins that play a role in the ss2-specific host-bacterium interactions unique to ss <dig> infection in pigs. in this study, we identified  <dig> putative in vivo-induced  proteins, which included proteins associated with bacterial cell wall structure, metabolism, regulation, molecule synthesis, substance transport and others. of these,  <dig> genes were selected for analysis by real-time pcr to confirm their in vivo upregulation. six genes were shown to be upregulated in vivo. these results suggest that these newly identified genes may contribute to ss <dig> pathogenesis.

RESULTS
sera selection and adsorption
iviat depends on the presence of antibodies directed against pathogen antigens expressed in vivo, so the selection of convalescent sera for use in iviat must be carefully considered. in this study, sera were selected that had an antibody titer of at least  <dig> . all eight convalescent-phase sera, which were collected from recovered pigs as described in the materials and methods, had antibody titers above  <dig> . these eight pooled convalescent-phase sera were mixed at equal volumes to create a sera cocktail for iviat, in order to best balance individual immune variability with the effects of dilution.

the adsorption efficiency was determined by examining the immunoreactivity of the serum aliquots from the pooled swine convalescent-phase sera after each adsorption step with whole cells and cell lysates of in vitro-grown zy <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the immunoreactivity of the pooled sera with in vitro-grown ss <dig> progressively decreased with each round of adsorption; the decrease in immunoreactivity was particularly noticeable after the first adsorption step.

the immunoreactivity of the adsorbed pooled convalescent sera against in vitro-derived ss <dig> proteins was further assessed with dot-elisa using the individually purified proteins mrp, ef, and gapdh, which are reportedly expressed on the cell surface . dot-elisa results showed that unadsorbed sera strongly reacted with mrp, ef, and gapdh . however, when the sera had been completely adsorbed with in vitro antigens, there were no spots on the nc membrane . these results further validated that antibodies specific to in vitro antigens had been fully removed from the convalescent-phase sera set.

use of adsorbed convalescent-phase sera to probe a genomic dna expression library of the ss <dig> isolate zy05719
to provide tenfold coverage of a ss <dig> genome , a plasmid library containing inserts whose average size is  <dig> kb would contain about  <dig>  ×  <dig> independent recombinants. the ss <dig> genomic library, prepared from strain zy <dig> isolated from a sichuan ss <dig> outbreak , in e. coli dh5α consisted of approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> clones for each expression vector . these three libraries were used for iviat selection with the adsorbed convalescent sera. during the primary screening,  <dig> of the most intensely immunoreactive clones were selected. following rigorous selection,  <dig> clones that continuously showed a strong positive reaction with the adsorbed convalescent-phase sera antibodies were identified. their immunoreactivity was confirmed by an additional screening, in which these clones were compared with clones bearing the vectors alone without any inserts present. the positive clones were picked out and then cultured in broth. the presence of a cloned dna insert in all  <dig> clones was confirmed by pcr analysis and sequencing.

categorization of the ivi proteins according to the actual or putative functions of the genes identified by iviat
the sequencing results showed that most of the immunoreactive clones contained only a portion of the coding sequence of the relevant protein, and that these  <dig> clones encoded  <dig> different proteins. the difference in the number of positive clones and proteins is due to several clones encoding the same protein. for instance, clones  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> encoded the protein ysirk <dig>  the nucleotide/protein sequence data of the  <dig> in vivo-induced  proteins were deposited in the ncbi genbank database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, and the accession numbers that were assigned to these sequences are listed in table  <dig> 

cell envelope
† putative functions of hypothetical proteins were determined from ncbi database and cbs prediction servers when available.

‡ predicted by the psortb v. <dig>  program.

by evaluating previously published studies of streptococcus species and performing sequence alignments, we were able to assign a functional classification to  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins identified by iviat. since the ss <dig> genomes have not been completely annotated, the genes identified by iviat were named after their homolog in other bacteria, when possible. when an ivi gene was unnamed, it was assigned an annotation number http://www.sanger.ac.uk/projects/microbes. these unnamed genes did not demonstrate good homology with the ss <dig> p1/ <dig> genome determined by the sanger institute http://www.sanger.ac.uk/projects/microbes. therefore, these genes were annotated http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. table  <dig> shows the  <dig> ivi proteins encoded by these  <dig> clones that were categorized according to the actual or putative functions of the open reading frames  identified by iviat. the ivi proteins were grouped into eight categories: cell envelope, regulatory, molecule synthesis, substance and energy metabolism, transport, translation, others, and those with unknown functions.

among these  <dig> newly identified ivi proteins, we found three proteins previously reported to have putative roles in streptococcus virulence.  protein ysirk <dig>  when performing protein-protein blast with the newly identified ivi proteins against the ncbi database, we found that the protein encoded by ysirk <dig> is a potential virulence protein. its sequence indicates that it is a subtilisin-like serine protease homologous to surface-associated subtilisin-like serine protease prta of streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, prta was also identified by screening a genomic expression library from streptococcus pneumoniae using a convalescent-phase serum. bethe and colleagues reported that prta is a highly conserved virulence factor of streptococcus pneumoniae, and might be a promising candidate for a protein-based vaccine  <cit> .  autolysin, the autolysin encoded by cwh is also a reported virulence-associated factor in ss <dig>  <cit> . most bacteria possess several autolysins that are able to degrade their cell walls, and are implicated in various biological functions including cell separation, cell wall turnover, restructuring of cell walls, and bacterial autolysis. in addition, certain autolysins have also been reported to contribute to the pathogenicity of gram-positive bacteria. for example, an intact autolytic function is required for the full virulence of streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> .  protein trag, trag is a component of the type iv secretion system , a virulence-associated pathway of ss <dig>  <cit> . the bacterial t4ss, which is widely distributed among the gram-negative and -positive bacteria and is ancestrally related to bacterial conjugation machines , contributes to pathogenicity  <cit> .

analysis of the in vivo gene expression profiles
strain zy <dig> was selected for real-time pcr analysis because it is one of the strains isolated from the  <dig> ss <dig> outbreak in china; zy <dig> was also used for constructing the genomic library. of the  <dig> putative ivi genes,  <dig>  were selected for further analysis of gene expression by real-time pcr. we selected these genes based on their putative functions, such as involvement in cell structure, metabolism, regulation, and transport, in order to maximize the variety of genes chosen for further analysis. the in vitro expression of these  <dig> putative ivi genes was observed in early lag phase, log phase, late log phase, and stationary phase of growth, with the highest level of expression occurring at late log phase . before comparing the expression of these  <dig> putative ivi genes under the in vitro condition, they were first tested under in vivo conditions . all of the putative ivi genes were expressed in vivo under the conditions tested . with the exception of ysirk and ss- <dig>  which were expressed at  <dig> h pi but not at  <dig> and  <dig> h pi, and ss- <dig>  which was expressed until  <dig> h, the remaining  <dig> ivi genes were expressed at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post-inoculation in vivo. the aim of this study was to identify the genes whose expressions are upregulated in vivo; therefore, we determined the in vivo gene expression relative to the highest level of expression in vitro. of the  <dig> analyzed genes, six genes, namely, ss- <dig>  trag, nlpa, hprk, sdh, and ss- <dig>  were upregulated in vivo relative to the highest level of expression of the corresponding gene in vitro .

location of the ivi genes on the ss <dig> chromosome
to learn about location of the  <dig> ivi genes on the ss <dig> chromosome, we used blast to identify them in the s. suis strain p1/ <dig> genomic sequence . four genes  did not have high homology with p1/ <dig>  but demonstrated homology with strains s. suis 89/ <dig>  98hah <dig>  and 05zyh <dig>  the remaining six genes could not be located because their sequences were short and did not show high homology with any other sequence in the database.

pathogenicity islands  are clusters of genes that may contribute to virulence in pathogens, sometimes by responding to environmental signals  <cit> . wei et al.  predicted eight possible ss <dig> pathogenicity islands based on a systematic analysis of the ss <dig> strain p1/ <dig> genomic sequence  <cit> . in this study, five ivi genes  were found to be distributed in four pathogenicity islands  when located on the ss <dig> chromosome.

strain distribution of ivi genes
to determine whether the newly identified ivi genes are common among ss <dig> isolates, we examined their distribution in ss <dig> isolates with different backgrounds, including those isolated at different times and from different regions and sources. pcr was employed to analyze the distribution of  <dig> ivi genes in chinese strains . twenty-three ss <dig> strains isolated from different regions of china in different years were analyzed, and pcr results showed that the distribution ratio of these ivi genes were as follows: ss- <dig> , trag , nlpa , srt , cwh , hprk , ysirk , ss- <dig> , sdh , ss- <dig>  . the genomic sequences of ss <dig> strains p1/ <dig>  89/ <dig>  98hah <dig>  05zyh <dig> were collected from sanger or the ncbi data library. the distribution of the  <dig> ivi genes in these strains was determined by nucleotide sequence alignment . with the exception of gene trag, which was not found in strain p1/ <dig>  the nine remaining ivi genes were found in all four of the above strains .

*, the distribution of the  <dig> ivi genes in strains was analyzed by colony pcr.

discussion
s. suis infection is a major cause of sudden death of pigs, and is also increasingly becoming a human health concern due to its zoonotic transmission capabilities. attempts to control the infection have been hampered by our lack of knowledge about ss <dig> pathogenicity. the identification and characterization of putative virulence factors and other infection-related proteins will aid in the prevention and control of ss <dig> disease. iviat provides a "snapshot" of protein expression during infection, allowing us a glimpse into the possible mechanisms by which this pathogen might counter host defenses and adapt and establish itself within the host to cause disease  <cit> . in the present study, we used the newly developed iviat method to select in vivo-induced proteins.

convalescent-phase sera collected from pigs naturally infected with ss <dig> are ideal for iviat  <cit> . however, for multiple reasons, it is not easy to acquire convalescent-phase sera from ss <dig> natural infection. first, epidemiological studies have found that ss <dig> outbreaks are usually infrequent and only affect a small number of pigs, which can lead to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis. second, pigs infected with ss <dig> do not always show obvious clinical symptoms, and may become carriers without showing clinical signs. finally, based on its polysaccharide capsular antigens, at least  <dig> serotypes of s. suis exist. isolates belonging to other serotypes  have also been associated with disease in pigs  <cit> . common antigens had been found to be shared between ss <dig> and these other serotypes . to reduce these possible interferences, we used pigs with clear backgrounds as animal models, and convalescent sera were prepared following artificial infection.

until recently, the exact mechanism of ss <dig> transmission  was still poorly understood, but was thought to involve aerosol transmission or other pathways  <cit> . however, some hypotheses about the critical stages of the infection, such as bacterial invasion from the mucosal surfaces to the bloodstream, survival of the bacteria in blood, and invasion from blood into the central nervous system have been presented  <cit> . regardless of the mechanism of ss <dig> invasion, circulation in the blood plays an important role during ss <dig> disease development. in addition, s. suis is an agent of zoonosis, afflicting people in close contact with infected pigs or pork-derived products. the organisms probably gain entry via small wounds or through inhalation  <cit> . furthermore, transmission between pigs in herds through cutaneous wounds has been suggested  <cit> . in light of these considerations, intravenous and intramuscular inoculations were employed to assay the expression of ss <dig> in vivo, and to try to mimic natural infection .

in this study, we used real-time pcr to analyze the induction of the expression of ivi genes under different environmental conditions. real-time pcr results demonstrated that the expression of six of the  <dig> selected genes was upregulated under in vivo conditions. the upregulation time points for these six genes were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h for ss- <dig> and trag,  <dig> h for hprk and sdh, and  <dig> h for nlpa and ss- <dig>  this upregulated expression suggests that these genes may play a significant role during the course of ss <dig> infection . the expression profiles of the other four genes  showed that they were not obviously upregulated under the in vivo condition . there are two possible explanations for this result. first, since we measured the in vivo gene expression at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h pi, it is possible that we missed the time when the levels of expression of these genes were high relative to the expression of the same gene in vitro. for instance, they may play roles in the rapid replication of ss <dig> during an early stage of infection. second, the mrna concentration might not reflect the amount of protein or antigen produced if these antigens are regulated post-transcriptionally.

the protein trag, which is a component of a type iv secretion system , was identified. the t4ss mediates horizontal gene transfer, thus contributing to genome plasticity, the evolution of infectious pathogens, and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and other virulence traits  <cit> . the gene trag was found in 98hah <dig>  05hah <dig>  canada strain 89/ <dig>  and all the tested chinese ss <dig> virulent strains, but not in european strain p1/ <dig> or the non-virulent strain t <dig> . brucella species require a t4ss to reach their proper niche and to replicate within host cells  <cit> . whether dna transfer through a t4ss occurs between ss <dig> isolates and results in an increase in virulence is unknown, and will only be answered by future studies.

lipoproteins that are upregulated in vivo in other pathogenic organisms have been identified, and have been shown to be likely important for pathogenesis  <cit> . for instance, in a previous study of vibrio vulnificus using iviat, a putative lipoprotein was also found to be induced in vivo when convalescent-phase sera from patients who survived v. vulnificus septicemia were used to screen a genomic library of this organism  <cit> . as for nlpa, almost nothing is known about the homolog of this gene in the ncbi database. the partial nlpa protein sequence was identified as a lipoprotein in the 89/ <dig> genome database, and shares 100% identity with a putative nlpa.

hpr kinase/p-ser-hpr phosphatase  is a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system . it is also a sensor of two-component signal transduction systems   <cit> . thus, hprk/p provides a link between carbon metabolism and the development of virulence  <cit> . for example, the expression of several virulence genes, such as the hemolysin-encoding hly and the phospholipase-encoding plca, is repressed when listeria monocytogenes is grown on cellobiose, glucose, fructose, or other rapidly metabolizable carbon sources  <cit> .

l-serine dehydratase, an iron-sulfur protein  <cit> , was identified, and this gene was also found in the canadian strain 89/ <dig>  during the course of the infection, alternative carbon sources  are utilized by bacteria for growth due to competition for nutrients. the results of velayudhan et al. showed that the catabolism of l-serine by serine dehydratase was crucial for the growth of campylobacter jejuni under in vivo conditions  <cit> . in addition, the fermentation of amino acids produces ammonia that neutralizes the surrounding ph; this neutralization is beneficial since it protects group a streptococcus  from acid-induced damage  <cit> .

the protein encoded by ss- <dig> is an abc-type transporter, but its function is still unknown. gene ss- <dig> is a conserved hypothetical outer membrane protein in ss <dig> genome database, and almost nothing is known about this gene. it was found in all tested strains in this study, and in canada strain 89/ <dig> and european strain p1/ <dig> 

many surface proteins of pathogenic gram-positive bacteria are linked to the cell wall envelope by a sorting mechanism that recognizes an lpxtg motif, but surface proteins of streptococcus pneumoniae harbor another motif, ysirk-g/s  <cit> . about  <dig> surface proteins of staphylococcus aureus carry the ysirk-g/s motif, whereas those of listeria monocytogenes and bacillus anthracis do not  <cit> . while the function of the ysirk motif has not been completely elucidated, it may contribute to the efficient secretion of a protein  <cit> . in the present study, four clones encoded two proteins containing this motif. although the gene ysirk was only detected  <dig> h after ss <dig> infection and then disappeared, and was not strongly upregulated in vivo, the mature protein encoded by ysirk <dig> showed homology to the surface-associated subtilisin-like serine protease prta  of s. pneumoniae <cit> . however, the role of this protein during ss <dig> infection remains to be determined.

iviat enables the identification both of proteins expressed specifically during host infection but not during growth under standard laboratory conditions, and of proteins expressed at significantly higher levels in vivo than in vitro. but iviat has its own limitations. iviat will not identify all virulence-associated genes. genes that are expressed both in vivo and in vitro and genes that are not expressed effectively in the e. coli host expression system will not be identified. for instance, some previously reported ss <dig> virulence factors, such as mrp, ef, fbps, cps, and sly, could not be screened out by iviat in this study. we speculate that they are expressed in both in vivo and in vitro growth conditions, and therefore antibodies specific to these antigens had been eliminated during the convalescent sera adsorption steps.

unexpectedly, some of the genes identified are likely expressed during in vitro growth conditions, such as dna polymerase i and iii, primosomal protein n, protein cpn <dig>  and smc protein . we speculate that perhaps their expression level was higher during in vivo growth than in vitro growth, and therefore they were detected by the iviat.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results suggest that during the course of infection, bacterial metabolism, envelope composition, and virulence will be adjusted for bacteria to survive in the hostile environment. bacterial pathogens sense their environment, and in response, genes are induced or repressed through spatial and temporal regulation. genes and gene pathways identified by iviat may play a role in virulence or pathogenesis during host infection, and may be appropriate for inclusion in therapeutic, vaccine, or diagnostic applications. the results of this study yielded a set of potentially valuable proteins of a manageable number for future studies on ss <dig> pathogenicity and for the development of specific diagnostics and vaccines.
