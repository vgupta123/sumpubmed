BACKGROUND
taste buds house specialized neuroepithelial cells that sense and transmit information regarding the composition of food  <cit> . these taste cells express receptors for sweet, bitter, umami , sour and salty tastants in apical microvilli facing the saliva  <cit> . following taste receptor activation, taste cells depolarize and fire action potentials resulting in the release of neurotransmitters to nerve fibers innervating basolateral membranes  <cit> . segregation of taste receptors at the taste pore from the machinery involved in transmitting signals to nerve fibers is mediated by tight junctions, specialized protein networks that separate apical and basolateral membrane domains  <cit> .

information regarding the composition of food flows from the apical to the basolateral domain in taste receptor cells. binding of tastants to apical sweet, bitter, and umami g protein-coupled receptors activates a signal transduction pathway involving the heterotrimeric g protein alpha subunit gustducin, phospholipase c β <dig>  the type  <dig> inositol  <dig>   <dig>  5-triphosphate receptor and calcium release from intracellular stores  <cit> . calcium, in turn, activates the monovalent-selective cation channel trpm <dig>  and the resultant sodium influx depolarizes sweet, bitter, and umami taste cells  <cit> . in contrast, sour tastants likely directly gate an acid-sensitive ion channel leading to cation influx and sour taste cell depolarization; pkd2l <dig> is a candidate sour taste receptor  <cit> . salty taste encompasses amiloride-sensitive and amiloride-insensitive components. the amiloride-sensitive pathway may require an epithelial sodium channel, however the precise target of amiloride is undefined, and the amiloride-insensitive pathway may require a non-selective cation channel expressed in nerve elements  <cit> . specialized voltage sensors, the voltage-gated sodium channels, detect membrane depolarization and initiate the rising phase of action potentials that code tastant information to afferent gustatory nerve fibers  <cit> . despite the observance of voltage-gated sodium currents in taste receptor cells for the past two decades  <cit> , the molecular identity of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene products that sense depolarizing stimuli and initiate taste cell action potentials are unknown.

we describe the molecular and histological expression profiles of cation channels involved in transmitting information from apical taste receptors to basolateral nerve fibers. scn2a, scn3a and scn9a voltage-gated sodium channels were identified in sweet, bitter, umami, and sour taste cell populations. scn2a, scn3a and scn9a channels are, therefore, positioned to sense depolarizing stimuli stemming from taste receptor activation and initiate action potentials coding tastant information.

RESULTS
localization of trpm <dig> and pkd2l <dig> in taste receptor cells
we localized trpm <dig>  a calcium-activated monovalent-selective cation channel that opens following tastant activation of sweet, bitter, and umami g protein-coupled receptors  <cit> , and pkd2l <dig>  an ion channel in sour taste cells  <cit> , in relation to zo- <dig>  a component of tight junctions that separate apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains  <cit> . trpm <dig> immunoreactivity was polarized beneath tight junctions to the basolateral membrane region and present in cell bodies of taste bud cells , whereas pkd2l <dig> immunoreactivity was enriched in taste cell processes that extend to the apical membrane and present in cell bodies of taste bud cells . careful examination revealed that trpm <dig> immunolabelling was abundant in lateral membrane domains immediately beneath tight junctions but absent from the apical taste pore . pkd2l <dig> immunolabelling, by contrast, was present at the apical taste pore region above tight junctions .

taste bud cells express scn2a, scn3a and scn9a voltage-gated sodium channel genes
taste bud cells depolarize, activate voltage-gated sodium channels, and fire action potentials in response to tastants  <cit> . initial cell depolarization is attributed to sodium influx through trpm <dig> in sweet, bitter, and umami taste cells and an undetermined cation influx through an ion channel in sour taste cells expressing pkd2l <dig>  <cit> . microarray analyses revealed voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channel transcripts prevalent in mouse taste buds . to elucidate the molecular identities of the voltage-gated sodium channel activated by these depolarizing stimuli, mouse taste bud and lingual epithelial cells were collected by laser capture microdissection   and analyzed by rt-pcr. gustducin, a g protein involved in sweet, umami, and bitter taste signalling  <cit> , t1r <dig>  a component of the sweet taste receptor  <cit> , trpm <dig>  and pkd2l <dig> were exclusively expressed in taste buds and absent from lingual epithelial cells, demonstrating efficient isolation of taste tissue by lcm . the housekeeping genes β-actin and gapdh were expressed in taste buds and lingual epithelial cells validating that intact rna was isolated from both regions .

the voltage-gated sodium channel family is comprised of ten members: scn1a , scn2a , scn3a , scn4a , scn8a , and scn9a  are blocked by tetrodotoxin, whereas scn5a , scn7a , scn10a , and scn11a  are not blocked by tetrodotoxin  <cit> . scn2a, scn3a and scn9a were specifically expressed in circumvallate  taste buds in the back of the tongue  and fungiform  taste buds in the front of the tongue  but not detectable in lingual epithelial cells by rt-pcr analysis. scn3a was the thirteenth top expressed taste bud-associated gene in microarray studies. other scn genes were not readily detectable in taste buds . although primer sets covered known splice variants described in genbank, it is conceivable that novel splice variants may increase the functional repertoire of voltage-gated sodium channels in taste buds. taste bud expression of scn3a and scn2a transcripts was validated by in situ hybridization . scn3a and scn2a antisense probes labelled taste buds cells, similar to trpm <dig> and pkd2l <dig> probes, while control sense probes yielded no signal . scn9a expression was not detected by ish . thus, scn2a, scn3a and scn9a are taste bud-associated genes.

immunohistochemistry  studies were performed to evaluate scn2a, scn3a and scn9a protein expression in taste buds. antisera to scn3a and scn9a labelled a subset of taste cells , whereas antisera to scn2a labelled numerous taste cells in cv taste buds  . signals were localized to cell bodies and processes below tight junctions; labelling was not observed at the apical taste pore. preincubation of antisera with the relevant immunizing peptide abolished taste cell labelling . in addition to taste cells, scn2a antisera also labelled nerve fibers innervating taste cells  and the nerve plexus below taste buds and near the basal lamina , similar to the reported neuronal markers syntaxin- <dig> and synaptobrevin- <dig>  <cit> . scn2a, scn3a, and scn9a antisera also labelled fg taste bud cells .

scn2a, scn3a and scn9a are expressed in specific taste cell populations
voltage-gated sodium channel currents have been recorded in trpm <dig> cells  as well as pkd2l <dig> cells   <cit> . therefore, double label ihc studies were conducted to determine the specific taste cell population expressing scn2a, scn3a and scn9a. to this end, we first validated that trpm <dig> and pkd2l <dig> antisera labelled distinct cell types  as previously reported using ish analyses  <cit> . there were  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  trpm <dig> cells and  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  pkd2l <dig> cells per section. scn3a immunoreactivity was present in trpm <dig> cells  indicating that scn3a is a voltage gated sodium channel in sweet, bitter, and umami cells . by contrast, scn3a immunoreactivity was absent from pkd2l <dig> cells , demonstrating that scn3a is not expressed in sour cells . similar to scn3a, scn9a immunoreactivity was present in trpm <dig> cells   and absent from pkd2l <dig> cells  . scn2a immunoreactivity was present in trpm <dig> cells  as well as pkd2l <dig> cells . due to the abundance of scn2a labelling, it was difficult to quantitate expression in separate trpm <dig> and pkd2l <dig> cell populations. when trpm <dig> and pkd2l <dig> antisera were combined, nearly all cells coexpressed scn2a  , indicating that scn2a is a voltage-gated sodium channel in sweet, bitter, umami, and sour cells.

hcn <dig> is expressed in pkd2l <dig> cells
the hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> were proposed as a candidate sour taste receptor  <cit> . since cesium, a blocker of hcn channels, did not attenuate taste cell responses to sour stimuli, it is unlikely that hcn channels are the primary sensor for acidic tastants  <cit> . hcn channels could, however, modulate sour taste cell function. we first tested if hcn transcripts were expressed in taste buds by rt-pcr analysis as reported previously  <cit> . hcn <dig> transcripts were detected in taste buds isolated by lcm . we next conducted ihc experiments to evaluate hcn <dig> expression in taste cell populations. hcn <dig> antisera labelled a subset of fg and cv taste cells  and signals were blocked by preincubation with the immunizing peptide . double labelling studies revealed that hcn <dig> immunoreactivity was absent from trpm <dig> cells  and present in pkd2l <dig> cells . cells expressing hcn <dig> did not express trpm <dig>  but coexpressed pkd2l <dig> , indicating that hcn <dig> is expressed in the sour taste cell population. careful examination revealed that hcn <dig> immunoreactive taste cell processes terminated below the apical membrane, labelled with pkd2l <dig> , and below tight junctions, labelled with zo- <dig> . thus, analogous to trpm <dig>  hcn <dig> is expressed in membrane compartments beneath tight junctions.

discussion
identification of the voltage-gated sodium channels in taste receptor cells has important implications for understanding taste cell signal transduction and the transmission of tastant information from apical taste receptors to basolateral nerve fibers. we identified transcripts for the tetrodotoxin-sensitive scn2a, scn3a, and scn9a voltage-gated sodium channels in taste buds isolated by laser capture microdissection. therefore, scn2a, scn3a, and scn9a gene products likely generate the tetrodotoxin sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel currents recorded from taste cells  <cit> . notably, transcripts for the tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channels scn5a, scn7a, scn10a and scn11a were not detected in taste buds, in line with the absence of tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium currents in taste cells  <cit> . scn3a and scn9a were specifically expressed in trpm <dig>  cells whereas scn2a was expressed in trpm <dig> and pkd2l <dig>  cells. we propose that scn2a, scn3a, and scn9a sense the initial depolarizing stimuli stemming from taste receptor activation at the apical membrane and initiate action potentials coding tastant information to gustatory nerve fibers at the basolateral membrane.

in response to tastants, taste bud cells depolarize, activate voltage-gated sodium channels, and fire action potentials  <cit> . an initial cell depolarization, referred to as a receptor potential, is attributed to sodium influx through trpm <dig> in sweet, bitter, and umami cells  <cit> . therefore, precise spatial localization of the calcium-activated trpm <dig> cation channel is essential for efficient detection of calcium signals stemming from sweet, bitter, and umami taste receptor activation. we localized trpm <dig> to the basolateral membrane domain and, more specifically, observed polarization of trpm <dig> immediately beneath tight junctions. enrichment of trpm <dig> in lateral cell processes below the taste pore would simultaneously allow for efficient detection of calcium-signals associated with apical taste receptor stimulation and permit sodium influx from the sodium-replete interstitial fluid bathing taste cell basolateral membranes. importantly, trpm <dig> immunoreactivity was absent from apical microvilli, consistent with polarization of trpm <dig> to the basolateral membrane in chemosensory cells of the respiratory system and gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . opening apical membrane trpm <dig> channels would not efficiently depolarize taste cells due to the lack of a strong electrochemical driving force for sodium entry from saliva, which exhibits a naturally low sodium concentration  <cit> .

in contrast to sweet, bitter, and umami taste cells, where taste receptor activation initiates a signal transduction cascade leading to cell depolarization  <cit> , sour taste cell depolarization is likely mediated by direct gating of an ion channel by acids in cells expressing pkd2l <dig>  <cit> . we localized pkd2l <dig> to the apical taste pore region above tight junctions. expression of pkd2l <dig> at the apical membrane would allow sour cells to directly sample saliva for acids. since pkd2l <dig> generates a non-selective cation channel permeable to monovalent and divalent ions,  <cit> , influx of protons, from acidic tastants, or calcium, from saliva, down their respective electrochemical gradients would directly depolarize sour cells. application of acids to the taste pore results in an influx of extracellular calcium in sour cells, suggesting that calcium may constitute a depolarizing signal  <cit> .

hcn channel transcripts and acid-sensitive hyperpolarization-activated currents have been identified in taste cells, suggesting that hcn channels may constitute a sour taste receptor  <cit> . this hypothesis is not supported by findings that cesium, an inhibitor of hcn currents, did not affect taste cell responses to sour stimuli  <cit> . we specifically localized hcn <dig> to pkd2l <dig>  taste cells. polarization of hcn <dig> to cell processes below the apical membrane indicates that hcn <dig> is not a primary sour detector; however, hcn <dig> may modulate depolarizing signals originating at the apical membrane. as hcn <dig> inward currents are augmented by low ph  <cit> , interstitial sodium influx through hcn <dig> may bolster depolarizing stimuli and generate pacemaker currents important for action potential generation in sour cells  <cit> . alternatively, since hcn <dig> currents are modulated by camp  <cit> , activators of stimulatory and inhibitory g-proteins could affect hcn <dig> inward currents and regulate sour taste cell activation  <cit> .

we identified multiple voltage-gated sodium channel transcripts in isolated taste buds. ihc studies revealed that scn3a and scn9a were expressed in trpm <dig>  cells while scn2a was expressed in trpm <dig> and pkd2l <dig>  cells. sodium channels localized to cell bodies and basolateral membrane domains, where they are positioned to sense the initial depolarization from taste receptors. influx of sodium from the interstitial fluid through scn2a, scn3a, and scn9a would lead to the rising phase of action potentials. since the taste cell resting membrane potential is close to the threshold voltage for action potential generation  <cit> , a small initial depolarization from trpm <dig> and the sour taste receptor would result in a large subsequent depolarization by voltage-gated sodium channels. trpm <dig> cells express three tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels, scn2a, scn3a, and scn9a. neurons and neuroepithelial cells frequently express multiple voltage-gated sodium channels  <cit> . sequestration of channels to specialized microdomains in neurons allows compartmentalization of channel function. scn2a and scn8a localize to axon initial segments and nodes of ranvier for action potential initiation, whereas scn1a and scn3a localize to the somatodendritic region, for integration of post-synaptic potentials and action potential back-propagation  <cit> . in this manner, scn2a, scn3a, and scn9a may distribute to trpm <dig> cell microdomains that are not discernable without ultrastructural analysis. in addition to differences in subcellular localization, voltage-gated sodium channels exhibit distinct activation and inactivation profiles. scn2a and scn3a inactivate rapidly and contribute to repetitive action potentials, whereas scn9a persistent currents, stemming from inherent slow closed-state inactivation, augment depolarizing stimuli  <cit> . thus, expression of multiple voltage-gated sodium channels in trpm <dig> cells would allow for precise control of action potential kinetics and waveform.

in addition to voltage-gated sodium channels, taste receptor cells express voltage-gated potassium channels and voltage-gated calcium channels important for firing action potentials  <cit> , as well as voltage-gated chloride channels that may modulate resting membrane potentials and neurotransmission  <cit> . the molecular identity of these channels is beginning to be elucidated. the voltage-dependent potassium channel kcnq <dig>  was identified in many taste cells, including trpm <dig> cells and pkd2l <dig> cells, whereas kcnh <dig>  was identified in a subset of trpm <dig> cells  <cit> . the voltage-dependent calcium channel cacna1a  was expressed in pkd2l <dig> cells, marked with snap- <dig>  <cit> . the voltage-gated chloride channel clc- <dig> was expressed in trpm <dig> and pkd2l <dig> cells, marked with the type  <dig> inositol  <dig>   <dig>  5-triphosphate receptor and snap- <dig> respectively  <cit> . these numerous voltage-gated ion channels likely contribute to the diversity of action potentials observed in taste cells. trpm <dig> cells lack voltage-gated calcium channels  <cit> ; thus, action potentials in this cell population consist entirely of depolarizing sodium and hyperpolarizing potassium currents. by contrast, pkd2l <dig> cells contain voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels and action potentials in this cell population consist of sodium and calcium depolarizing currents coupled with potassium hyperpolarizing currents. depolarization via voltage-gated sodium channels may be required to activate voltage-gated calcium channels. the role of voltage-gated ion channels in amiloride-sensitive and amiloride-insensitive salty taste cell signal transduction is an unexplored area and requires future investigation. analysis of knockout mice specifically lacking voltage-gated ion channels in taste cells will elucidate the role of action potentials in taste cell function.

integrating our findings into a current model for taste cell signalling, we propose that activation of scn2a, scn3a, and scn9a in trpm <dig> cells generates action potentials and the ensuing depolarization associated with sodium influx stimulates release of atp neurotransmitter from pannexin/connexin hemichannels to afferent gustatory nerve fibers  <cit> . in pkd2l <dig> cells, activation of scn2a would generate action potentials and calcium influx via voltage-gated calcium channels would release neurotransmitters by conventional calcium-dependent exocytosis at synapses  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
scn2a, scn3a, and scn9a voltage-gated sodium channels are expressed in trpm <dig> and pkd2l <dig> taste cells. these voltage-gated sodium channels are positioned to sense the initial depolarizing signals stemming from taste receptor activation at the taste pore and convert signals into action potentials coding taste information to the nervous system.
