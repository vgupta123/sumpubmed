BACKGROUND
bacteria harbor diverse defense systems against phages, plasmids, and mobile elements, likely driven by the coevolutionary dynamics between bacteria and their parasites. the recently discovered microbial immune system crispr/cas contains the crispr  locus, an array of sequence-specific repeats flanking unique spacers, and adjacent cas  genes  <cit> . cas genes characteristically show high rates of evolution, both in the protein sequence and in the operon structure resulting in different crispr/cas types  <cit> . this high diversity has been attributed to host-parasite coevolution  <cit> .

crispr mediated immunity acts in three stages. first, new spacer sequences are acquired from invasive elements that are incorporated into the crispr array. these sequences are the basis of the sequence-specific immune response. second, the crispr locus is transcribed and processed into mature crrnas by the associated cas proteins in a process known as biogenesis. lastly, in the interference stage, crrnas and associated cas proteins target and bind protospacers  leading to cleavage and degradation of the foreign genetic material.

pams  are short motif sequences in the nucleotide sequences of the invasive elements recognized by the crispr/cas system. they are necessary for the successful acquisition of a new spacer and for the interference with foreign dna. pams are specific to the different crispr types and repeat sequences  <cit> . note that the pam sequences for the acquisition and interference stages may differ slightly  <cit> . pam sequences have been identified with different methods, using phage challenge and plasmid elimination experiments, interference experiments, or computational methods . the most accurate identification comes from phage challenge and plasmid elimination experiments. in these experiments, new spacers are acquired that are homologous to the protospacer located on the phage or plasmid. pams are identified as the conserved motifs occurring next to these protospacers. the reason this method is accurate is that mutations have not yet occurred in the pam sequence, and it allows the determination of the acquisition motif. in interference experiments, in contrast, pams are tested for their ability to interfere with foreign genetic material: different motifs are tested for their ability to be recognized by the crispr system, with pams identified by their proximity to the recognized motifs. pams can be inferred computationally as motifs that are present close to inferred protospacers  <cit> . this third approach is limited because mutations may have occurred in the pams since the original acqusition of the protospacer and hence acquisition and interference motifs cannot be distinguished .table  <dig>

given the importance of these motifs for both spacer acquisition and interference, we hypothesize that pam sequences will be selected against if they occur in the genomes of phages co-evolving with crispr containing hosts. selection against pams might act in two ways. first, mutations disrupting pam sequences may allow phages to avoid crispr recognition in the interference stage  <cit> . second, a dearth of these sequences in the genome may allow phages to escape part of their genomes being acquired as a protospacer by the crispr system in the first place. we test this hypothesis for well-defined pam sequences used by crispr types i and ii , focusing on well-understood subtypes of these groups.

we investigate the underrepresentation of pams in bacteriophages that encounter crispr systems. specifically, we test for a depletion of pams in phages associated with host species harboring crispr/cas  by comparing them to phages associated with host species of the same genus not harboring crispr/cas . this allows us to detect selection acting against pams, even if the effect is weaker than for other factors affecting genome composition, such as codon usage, correct location of transcription factor binding sites, or mutational biases, as these forces should be uncorrelated with the presence of crispr in the host.

we employ two complementary measures of motif underrepresentation, or depletion, that account for mutational bias and selection in different ways . the resampling method controls for codon bias  <cit>  and accounts for selection on amino acid content and codon usage. the substring method controls for the frequency of substrings of length n -  <dig> of a motif of length n <cit>  and accounts for selection pressure and mutational bias on submotifs of length n -  <dig>  we use both methods to control for mutational bias and sources of selection other than immune avoidance. both methods result in a ratio of observed-over-expected frequencies, and the log <dig> ratio of the pam is denoted as rpam. rpam is an indication of over-  or underrepresentation  of the pam in a particular phage genome. for more powerful analyses in the presence of other selective factors, rpam-values of crispr + are compared to crispr - using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. rpam-values that are significantly smaller in crispr + are an indication of pam depletion due to selection to avoid the crispr defense system.

we present the results for all phage genomes with annotated hosts. to match phages and hosts, we made use of the /host annotation from the genbank file. notably this generally contains the information of the bacteria the phage was isolated from and not the full host range. in the second part we present more detailed results for the genus streptococcus. several facts make the genus streptococcus a good model system to study this question. first, the function of the crispr system was first described in s. thermophilus <cit> , and active crispr systems were also reported in other streptococcus species  <cit> . second, different crispr systems are present in different species , and the pam sequences have been studied for the different systems. third, phages have been described and sequenced for this genus, and their host specificity is known .

RESULTS
phages infecting all bacteria
we analyzed two data sets, one including any suitable data, and one focusing on the streptococcus genus, where the crispr system is particualarly well understood. for the first data set, we analyzed available sequence from phages infecting known and sequenced bacterial species , comprising  <dig> genomes for phages infecting  <dig> different bacterial hosts .

crispr type i-c
crispr type i-c has the pam gaa for all the species where the pam was studied . we found that both methods, resampling and substring, resulted in smaller rpam-values for phages infecting bacterial hosts with crispr  compared to those infecting hosts without crispr  when using all phages infecting bacteria . computing ratios separately for the forward and reverse strand results in a high correlation of the respective ratios  with a stronger depletion of the pam on the reverse strand . because of this strong correlation we combine ratios for both strands, unless stated otherwise. using both methods, the difference between crispr + and crispr - phages is significant using the wilcoxon rank-sum test . these results might be affected by a few host species with data for a large number of phages; however resampling the data set to give an even host distribution still yields significant results in most cases .figure  <dig>

to see whether our results also hold for closely related hosts, we repeated the analysis based on bacterial genera with at least three crispr - and three crispr + phages. for type i-c, this condition is only fulfilled for the genera bacillus, lactobacillus and streptococcus. of these, we only found evidence for pam depletion in crispr + for streptococcus phages .

crispr type i-e
several pams have been described for type i-e. for gammaproteobacteria, the acquisition motif aag and the interference motif awg are known, while, for an actinobacteria and a firmicute, the motif aay was found.

in gammaproteobacteria, the ratios for both aag and awg are, on average, larger than zero, indicating overrepresentation . crispr + phages show generally smaller ratios compared to crispr -, but the difference is significant only with the substring method. however, the result for awg could have been biased by the species distribution. to find particular hosts for which phages show a depletion, we repeated the analysis for the two gammaproteobacteria genera with at least three crispr - and three crispr + phages, pseudomonas and vibrio. of these, vibrio shows a clear depletion of the patterns aag and awg in crispr + .table  <dig>

next, we analyzed the motif aay observed or the actinobacteria and a firmicute. when we consider all hosts, including non-actinobacteria and non-firmicute, the motif aay is overrepresented in crispr + . note that the majority of these hosts are gammaproteobacteria, whose phages show depletion of the motif aag. it may be that the aag depletion and the aay overrepresenation are related, as aag motifs can be eliminated by a single mutation to aay. phages infecting hosts other than proteobacteria show a depletion in aay only with the substring method. the only non-proteobacteria genera with at least three crispr + and three crispr - phages are lactobacillus and mycobacterium, both of which show no evidence of pam depletion .figure  <dig>

phages infecting streptococcus
we next focus on the genus streptococcus. we extended this data set by including phages not in the genome database but in the nucleotide database and by including phages without a /host tag. this resulted in  <dig> phages . we group phages based on the host species, which is well-founded here as species in this genus are found to be monophyletic .

different types of crispr types i and ii were present and distributed over the streptococcus phylogeny . type i-f was only present in one species and was ignored in the following analysis. for type i-e, the motif was not known precisely , so we also did not consider that type. two kinds of type ii-a were present that could be distinguished through different csn <dig> homologs and different repeats. all types show the presence of pams . rpam values for the motifs analyzed here are given in additional file  <dig> 

crispr type i-c
as a preliminary step, we identified the pam for crispr type i-c bioinformatically by inferring consensus motifs adjacent to inferred protospacers. we recover the previously reported pam gaa for crispr type i-c  <cit> . we found this motif to be underrepresented in crispr + phages  compared to crispr - phages . this difference is robust to whether the resampling method or the substring method is used . a similar pattern was observed when the prophages were analyzed .figure  <dig>

there may, however, be an issue of phylogenetic non-independence. hosts with crispr are all from the pyogenic group or s. mutans, and their phages could be related as well. to determine whether this is the case, we compared the gene content of the phage genomes. orthologous proteins between two phage genomes were identified by reciprocal blast. we then calculated the similarity of a pair of genomes as the number of orthologs divided by the number of proteins in the smaller genome. the average pairwise similarity of phage genomes is 18%, whereas a pair of crispr + phages has an average similarity of 24%. thus the results are partly confounded by the relatedness of the phages, but the majority of the genes are different for a pair of genomes.

crispr type ii-a-1
different pams in different species and crispr loci were observed for crispr type ii-a. we again identified the motif bioinformatically : for type ii-a- <dig>  we found the pam ggng for s. thermophilus and gg for s. mutans and for the pyogenic group. gg is the motif or a submotif of all the pams observed for type ii-a- <dig>  it is generally underrepresented in the studied phages, and there is no evidence of a difference between the two groups .table  <dig>

the motif ggng has only been described to be the pam for s. thermophilus and not for other streptococcus phages. as expected, it is underrepresented in s. thermophilus phages , but not in most other crispr + phages. indeed, when including only the s. thermophilus phages in the crispr + group, the results were significant. the analysis further indicates that s. salivarius might share this longer motif as well . note that the difference between groups of phages is largely consistent between the two methods, but the absolute log-ratios are not. using the resampling method, the motif ggng seems generally underrepresented, whereas using the substring method the motif seems generally overrepresented. the latter can be explained by the expected frequencies being based on g-rich substrings that are themselves underrepresented in these species. notably, apart from the deviation in the absolute value, both methods detected the difference between s. thermophilus phages and other phages.figure  <dig>

crispr type ii-a-2
type ii-a- <dig> known as crispr <dig> in s. thermophilus, has the well-described acquisition motif agaaw  <cit> . cas <dig> has recently been shown to use the interference motif aaaaw in vitro <cit> . here, we found the pam anaaw computationally for s. thermophilus. the sequence differs from the pam found for the mitis group, which is aaag based on eight protospacers . it is not analyzed here due to the small number of observations and the lack of additional evidence. all different pam versions show no consistent pattern of underrepresentation in s. thermophilus phages . the acquisition motif agaaw shows a significant underrepresentation only with the substring method. this result can also be obtained when the strands are considered separately or the submotifs agaaa or agaat are analyzed .

discussion
here, we tested the hypothesis that selection favors the depletion of pams in genomes of phages with crispr containing hosts, but not in phages infecting hosts without the crispr locus. we found support for this hypothesis in some, but not all, of the genera and crispr systems tested.

in detail, the pam gaa for type i-c is generally underrepresented in phages infecting bacterial species having crispr  compared to phages infecting bacterial species not having crispr . this is consistent with the observation that this pam was found in all the systems studied . we analyzed all bacterial genera with at least three crispr + and at least three crispr - phages. of three genera fulfilling these conditions, the depletion is particularly strong in the streptococcus phages. pams for type i-e are variable and, thus, not generally depleted in crispr +. in gammaproteobacteria, the pams aag and awg were found. no conclusive pattern of depletion was found in gammaproteobacteria, as only one of the two methods indicates underrepresentation of these two motifs. of two genera that can be analyzed in detail, vibrio shows a clear depletion of both pams in crispr + compared to crispr -. note that the absolute ratios are around  <dig> or even larger than  <dig> for most v. cholera phages. thus, the depletion can only be recognized through a comparison with other vibrio phages. in bacteria other than proteobacteria, the pam aay was found. no evidence of depletion was found, but this motif might not generalize to the species studied here. pams for type ii were mainly studied for streptococcus. there is evidence for an underrepresentation of the pam ggng in s. thermophilus. taken together, the analysis based on species of one genus allows the identification of particular bacteria species with phages under selection for depletion of pams. in most analyses, we combine alternative motifs into one consensus motif and also ignore any strand bias. although a priming mechanism might lead to the acquisition of further spacers on a strand with an existing spacer  <cit> , there is no known bias for the first spacer. we found concordant results for the depletion measures for both strands.

several groups gave inconclusive results where only one method indicated underrepresentation in crispr +. for crispr <dig> in s. thermophilus, the acquisition motif agaaw is well studied. although the ratios for this motif are smaller in crispr + compared to crispr - for both methods, the difference is significant only for the substring method. our results contradict previous conclusions for streptococcus thermophilus <cit> . savitskaya et al. found no significant underrepresentation of agaaw using a z-score that is also based on substrings. two main methodological differences might explain this discrepancy. first, we did not assume the pressence of an a priori threshold, but compared the statistic to phages infecting other species of the same genus not having a crispr system that utilizes that particular pam. in contrast, a conservative z-score threshold of - <dig> was used by savitskaya et al. second, we subsumed the counts for all four motifs  into one ratio, whereas savitskaya et al. tested each motif separately and required that these separate analyses led to significant results. if we analyze the strands separately or the submotifs separately we also find a significant underepresentation with the substring method . the z-scores presented by savitskaya et al. for s. thermophilus clearly tend to be negative rather than positive, indicating underrepresentation. we thus conclude that our method that subsumes the frequencies for alternative motifs into one statistic and compares it with phages infecting other species is more powerful.

our evidence for pam depletion in some phage species adds to a growing literature on the way evolutionary forces shape the oligonucleotide content of microbial genomes. genomic sequences carry species-specific signals termed genomic signatures  <cit> . these signatures are useful for the classification of metagnomic sequences  <cit> . local divergences in genomic signatures carry signals for the detection of genomic islands and horizontally transferred genes  <cit> . similarities in signatures can be used to compute distance-based phylogenies for bacteria  <cit>  or viruses  <cit> , and they also support a co-evolution in signatures between bacteriophages and hosts  <cit> . frequencies of certain motifs have been used to study selection acting on bacteria and phage genomes. cpg nucleotides are underrepresented in some eukaryotic viruses  <cit> , and this could be due to the mimicking of the host composition to avoid immune recognition  <cit> . bacterial genomes are also depleted from spurious transcription factor binding sites due to weak selection  <cit> . furthermore, palindromes are underrepresented in phage and bacterial genomes due to restriction site avoidance  <cit> .

note that the role of crispr as a bacterial immune system has been questioned  <cit> . to our knowledge, only in streptococcus species, natural bacterial strains show crispr expansion after phage challenge, thus the role of the system in other species is even more obscure. in escherichia coli, crispr expansion after phage challenge was only observed when overexpressing the cas genes  <cit> . in concordance with this, no pam avoidance was observed in escherichia coli phages  <cit> . here, the ratios for the pam aag do also not tend to be negative for  <dig> e. coli phages . note, however, that the approach of comparing the ratios to closely related crispr - phages is more powerful for vibrio , which shows positive ratios, but lower ratios are observed in crispr +. however, this approach is not possible for e. coli. in addition, the acquisition motif for e. coli was recently shown to comprise more positions than the pam  <cit> . this might have resulted in a weaker selection pressure on individual positions of the pam than previously thought.

the dynamic nature of the system complicates the analyses presented in some cases. crispr/cas loci are often horizontally transferred or inactivated . in addition, changes in the pam sequence occur during evolution. thus, the evolutionary history affects the selection pressure on the phages over time and has an influence on what is detectable today. our observation of a depletion despite the fact that crispr/cas systems are dynamic and often occur in labile genomic regions, is surprising, because an ongoing selection pressure is needed for this observation. however, note that crispr is not only dynamic between bacterial species but in particular also within species  and crispr systems were postulated to be in a constant flux as a result of trade-off between positive and negative selection  <cit> . thus, we hypothesize that, in bacterial populations, crispr is dynamic but is maintained long-term in at least some strains of a species which can result in a detectable selection pressure on phages.

in addition to the dynamic nature of the crispr locus, other factors might have influenced the phenomenon where only phages infecting some groups of bacteria show a depletion in pams, while other phages do not. expansion of the crispr locus after phage challenge was only observed for some bacterial species. in other species, other defense systems may have played more important roles or bacteria could have evolved resistance more effectively by other means, for example, with mutations that prevented phage adsorption. in this case, phages that we annotated as crispr + may not encounter the crispr system. another factor that has an impact on the analyses are the phage-host relationships. the host annotation could not include the full host range of the phage and the annotated host may not even be a typical or frequent host for that phage.

in the bacterial species where the crispr system has an important role in bacteriophage infection, selection pressure on pams may have been high. note that at least in type i-e, the pam is thought to be required for the initial recognition and dsdna helix destabilisation  <cit> . furthermore many more phage mutations escaping crispr recognition occur in the pam compared to in the protospacer sequence . this is also an indication that selection pressure on pams is high.

CONCLUSIONS
the analyses presented here compare phages infecting hosts with and without crispr and, thus, have the power to show that phage genomes are under selection due to targeting by crispr systems. we observe a depletion of pams in phage genomes infecting hosts harboring crispr systems in some groups of bacteria. thus, there is a selection pressure against pams even in the presence of dynamic crispr/cas systems. this indicates that the systems have been acting in an efficient way in the species discussed here.

the results presented here might be driven by only some hosts, and detailed analyses based on genera could only be done for few genera. in the future, with more phage genomes and more bacteria with crispr information available, it will be possible to systematically test the selection hypothesis across a more diverse assemblage of species.

besides phage genome evolution, the crispr system might additionally have an effect on the evolution of other microbial parasites, like plasmids and other mobile elements. in future work, it would be interesting to investigate wether the crispr system also has an impact on plasmid evolution and to investigate its relative impact on phage and plasmid genomes.
