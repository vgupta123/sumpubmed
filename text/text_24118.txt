BACKGROUND
gata transcription factors perform conserved and essential roles during animal development, including germ layer specification, hematopoiesis, and cardiogenesis  <cit> . nevertheless, homologs in the gata gene family have undergone significant divergence in both sequence and gene number in different animal phyla, making it difficult to resolve orthologous relationships of individual family members  <cit> . for example, the number of gata paralogs – homologs within an individual genome – varies substantially between protostomes and deuterostomes. most vertebrate genomes possess six gata paralogs, whereas the fruitfly drosophila melanogaster has only five and the nematode/roundworm caenorhabditis elegans eleven. reconstructing the evolution and the ancestral developmental roles of these genes requires a framework of orthologous relationships among gata homologs.

previous studies have identified two classes of gata homologs within deuterostomes  <cit> . basal invertebrate deuterostomes, including echinoderms, urochordates, and cephalochordates, possess only single gata <dig> and gata <dig> orthologs. most vertebrates possess three paralogs from each class, likely from two whole genome duplication events that occurred during the evolution of jawed vertebrates. within the three vertebrate gata <dig> paralogs, the vertebrate gata- <dig> and - <dig> genes are more closely related to each other than to the gata- <dig> gene. likewise, the vertebrate gata- <dig> and - <dig> genes are both more closely related to each other than to the gata- <dig> gene  <cit> . thus two genome duplications, together with the losses of one gata- <dig> like paralog and one gata- <dig> like paralog, can account for the number of genes in each vertebrate gata class.

while the evolution of gata factors within the deeper branches of the deuterostome phylogeny is well understood, it has been more difficult to reconstruct the evolution of protostome gata factors. we recently published data suggesting that the last common protostome/deuterostome ancestor had at least two gata factors with distinct roles in early germ layer development: an endomesodermal gata <dig> gene and an ectodermal gata <dig> gene  <cit> . in this analysis, at least one representative was identified from each class in multiple protostome genomes, and the germ layer specific expression for each class was documented in a basal lophotrochozoan, the polychaete annelid platynereis dumerilii. however, orthologous relationships for the more degenerate c. elegans and drosophila gata transcription factors remained unclear.

here, we report an analysis of the complete complement of gata factors from several newly available protostome genomes. we have identified gata factors from nine diverse protostomes by directly searching databases from recently conducted whole genome sequencing efforts. we have conducted phylogenetic analyses using predicted protein sequences, conserved chromosomal gene order, and conserved intron/exon boundaries to better understand the evolution of protostome gata factors. our results provide evidence for protostome-specific expansions of gata <dig> paralogs and enable us to infer the evolutionary relationships of even the most divergent drosophila gata factors.

RESULTS
the complement of gata transcription factors from newly sequenced protostome genomes
to further investigate the evolution of gata transcription factors within protostomes, we obtained gata gene sequences from nine newly sequenced and phylogenetically informative protostome genomes . these include five arthropods , one nematode , and three lophotrochozoan  genomes. for almost all of these collected gata transcription factor genes we identified and assembled the complete dual-zinc finger domain for further analyses. we believe that these retrieved gata genes represent the complete gata gene complement within each analyzed genome .

each ortholog was initially assigned to either the ancestral bilaterian gata <dig> or gata <dig> class , based upon reciprocal best hit blast analysis . with the exclusion of the nematode caenorhabditis briggsae , each of the additional protostome genomes appeared to possess a single gata <dig> ortholog and three gata <dig> paralogs. in the four insect genomes, as well as in the single annelid , a fourth highly divergent gata <dig> paralog was detected. thus, our initial genome wide search indicated the existence of one single copy gata <dig> gene and multiple copies of gata <dig> genes within these additional protostome species.

molecular phylogenetic analysis defines multiple distinct gata <dig> clades within arthropods
resolving the phylogenetic relationships of gata transcription factors present in drosophila has been difficult due to their highly divergent gene sequences. previous work had shown that drosophila possesses an obvious gata <dig> ortholog, grain, as well as an unambiguous gata <dig> ortholog, pannier  <cit> . however, the placement of the three remaining drosophila gatas  has been uncertain due to extensive sequence divergence within the generally well-conserved dual zinc finger domain. the drosophila gata genes serpent and gatae have been proposed to be derived gata <dig> orthologs due to their roles in endoderm and/or mesoderm development  <cit> . however, like some vertebrate gata <dig> genes, serpent also has roles in blood development suggesting that serpent may be orthologous to all vertebrate gata genes  <cit> .

we now can resolve the uncertain drosophila gata factor relationships by including sequences from additional arthropod genomes. the phylogenetic tree in figure  <dig> represents the combined results of maximum likelihood , bayesian inference , and distance based  analyses . this tree was rooted with the sole gata transcription factor in the cnidarian nematostella vectensis , which appears to be equally related to gata <dig> and gata <dig> genes  <cit> . this analysis confirms the existence of two separate branches of bilaterian  gata factors, a clade of gata <dig> genes and a clade of gata <dig> genes. it replicates previous results  <cit> , but now with substantially increased support due to the presence of additional and more conserved gata sequences. with the addition of multiple arthropod sequences, the diverged drosophila serpent, gatae, and gatad now unambiguously group within the larger gata <dig> clade. the gata <dig> versus gata <dig> groupings are well supported by both ml and mb analyses, though not by nj analysis, which shows lower bootstrap support due to the occasional grouping of the nvgata within the gata <dig> clade. we presume this is a possible short-branch attraction artifact, due to the relatively low sequence divergence for the gata <dig> and nvgata genes. however, consistent with our results from the reciprocal best hit blast analysis , all of the arthropod genomes encode sole gata123/grain like orthologs but multiple gata <dig> like paralogs.

our more inclusive phylogenetic analysis also reveals orthologous groups among the arthropod gata <dig> paralogs. the four drosophila gata456-like transcription factors are co-orthologs of the vertebrate gata <dig> family, and appear to have independently expanded early in arthropod evolution. the drosophila gata <dig> paralogs are members of four distinct clades, each containing a single paralog from every analyzed insect genome. furthermore, three of these insect gata <dig> paralog groups appear to be conserved within the arthropods, as one paralog for each of the three clades are found in the crustacean daphnia, and in the chelicerate/tick ixodes. we have named the three common arthropod clades as gata456a/gatae, gata456ba/serpent, and gata456bb, using a nomenclature discussed below . gata456bb appears to have undergone an insect-specific duplication , resulting in the gata456bba/pannier and gata456bbb/gatad clades in insects, and hence explaining the fourth insect gata <dig> paralog.

while our results support four distinct clades within the arthropod gata <dig> subfamily, the deeper evolutionary relationships among these clades remain uncertain. nj and mb analyses represent the internal relationships between the four gata <dig> paralogous clades as an unresolved basal polytomy, despite the resolution of four external gata <dig> clades. however, the ml analysis suggests additional interclade relationships, as shown in the tree in figure  <dig>  all of the arthropod gata <dig> paralogs appear to form a distinct and well supported clade. the insect specific gata456bbb clade groups closely with gata456bba clade, and therefore appear to be duplicates from a common gata456bb gene. this topology also suggests that thegata456bb factors appear more closely related to gata456a orthologs than to the gata456ba ortholog group, but we have found no additional evidence to support this relationship.

an arthropod gata <dig> paralog cluster: synteny reveals orthologous relationships
to better understand the evolutionary relationships of arthropod gata <dig> paralogs, we examined the syntenic relationships among the different arthropod gata factors and discovered a conserved linkage of gata <dig> paralogs. as shown in figure  <dig>  we found that three of the drosophila genes – serpent, gatae, and pannier – are clustered within a  <dig> kb region on the drosophila 2r chromosome. we have identified a similar cluster of three tightly linked gata <dig> paralogs in other arthropod genomes, including additional insects and a crustacean . gene orientation within the cluster is fully conserved, and the gene order follows the predicted orthology suggested by the clades in our molecular phylogenetic analysis . as this cluster is conserved in all analyzed insects and a crustacean, we infer that this cluster arose at least as early as the pancrustacean ancestor, some  <dig> million years ago. no additional syntenic relationships were found when comparing the nearest upstream and downstream genes from each of the five assembled arthropod genomes, suggesting that gene order within this gata <dig> paralog cluster is more conserved than within surrounding chromosomal regions.

the conserved linkage suggests an origin from two tandem duplication events of a single ancestral gata <dig> transcription factor. this cluster includes an unambiguous gata <dig> ortholog   <cit> , further supporting our phylogenetic inference that these three homologs are all gata <dig> paralogs. furthermore, the weak homology of the three identified tick gata transcription factors to each of these paralogs suggests that this three-gene cluster may have existed in the last common arthropod ancestor. however, our initial attempts at local contig assembly  have failed to find linkage for the tick gata genes. gata gene linkage in the tick should soon be resolved, pending assembly of the whole tick genome.

a unique intron/exon structure for each of the three arthropod gata <dig> clades
the ~ <dig> aa dual-zinc finger domain that defines the broader gata transcription factor gene family, including both gata <dig> and gata <dig> homologs  <cit> , is encoded by three exons with similar intron/exon boundaries that are found in the sole cnidarian gata gene, and in all deuterostome gata genes we have examined . we infer that the ancestral gata transcription factor gene contained these three exons . an n-terminal exon  encodes the first zinc-finger, and a middle exon  encodes the second dna binding zinc-finger domain. the c-terminal exon  encodes a conserved stretch of ~ <dig> aa, after which conservation sharply drops.

although the exon structure of this dual zinc finger domain is well conserved in most gata homologs, many gata genes in the fruitfly drosophila melanogaster appear to lack the first zinc finger. in drosophila, the first gatae zinc finger is highly divergent, and gatad lacks any sign of the first zinc finger. serpent was initially thought to be a single zinc-fingered protein  <cit>  – two of the three splice variants for serpent lack the first zinc finger – but a more complete analysis identified the serpent isoform b with a complete conserved domain  <cit> . a lack of a first zinc finger in many gata factors within drosophila, as well as c. elegans , could suggest that these gata factors evolved from an ancestral sequence encoded by a single zinc finger  <cit> . however, our examination of additional arthropod gatas indicates that independent losses of the first zinc-finger have occurred. both zinc-finger exons appear intact for the three ancestral arthropod gata <dig> genes in the additional arthropod species. only the insect specific gata456bbb/gatad orthologs consistently lack the first zinc finger exon; however, our analysis shows these are relatively recent duplicates, and hence must have arisen from dual-zinc fingered gata <dig> factors. therefore, we conclude that the absence of the first exon and zinc finger in some drosophila gata genes is a derived rather than an ancestral trait.

our analysis of gata gene structure also suggests a derived loss or modification of the second  and third  exon boundary in many of the arthropod gata homologs .  <dig> of the  <dig> identified insect and crustacean  gata homologs have undergone a modification of this exon boundary compared to the inferred ancestral sequence. the second and third exons in all of the gata456bbb/gatad and gata456bba/pannier orthologs are fused. the gata456a/gatae genes have retained the ancestral state for the intron/exon domains, though they have also fused their second and third exons in dipteran insects. the gata456ba/serpent genes  also contain a second intron in the conserved domain, yet the boundaries of this second intron do not appear conserved.

the unusual intron/exon structure of the gata456ba/serpent genes suggests they may have resulted from an initial fusion of the second and third exon, and the subsequent introduction of a new intron. we have identified four examples of insect and daphnia gata456ba/serpent homologs in which the first  <dig> aa from the third exon  are now encoded within the middle exon . the high degree of sequence conservation implies a transfer between the original coding exons, as opposed to a loss of the beginning of the third exon and gain of surrounding genomic sequence at the end of the middle exon. this presumably rare sequence of events likely occurred only once, and was then preserved within gata456ba/serpent orthologs. the one exception, amelgata456ba, likely represents an additional intron loss.

to summarize, the clades of arthropod gata <dig> homologs defined by molecular phylogeny also exhibit clade-specific intron/exon structures. this correspondence provides a third line of evidence in support of our proposed orthologous relationships for these genes, as suggested by both molecular phylogenetic analysis and conserved syntenic gene order. the intron/exon structure also allows us to generate deeper inferences regarding interclade relationships .

extensive gene duplication and sequence divergence within the nematode gata family
we also analyzed the gata genes of two nematode species, caenorhabditis briggsae and caenorhabditis elegans. the gata gene family has undergone extensive duplication in nematodes, with eleven gata factors identified in c. elegans, and thirteen in c. briggsae. these sequences display significant sequence divergence, and only the elt-1/gata <dig> orthologs contain complete dual-zinc finger domains. the other predicted nematode gata factors all lack the first zinc finger, similar to some of the insect gatas.

although the nematode gata factors are highly derived in sequence, they resemble the arthropod gata complement in displaying a biased expansion of the gata <dig> paralogs. in a previous analysis, we assigned the c. elegans gata factors to one of the two classes based upon their reported germ layer-specific function or expression. four orthologs have roles in ectoderm  specification, while seven  or nine  have roles in endomesoderm  specification . however, our phylogenetic tree  suggests that elt- <dig> is the sole gata <dig> ortholog in both nematode species, and that all the remaining nematode gatas group within the gata <dig> class. the long branches of these additional gatas, and the short regions of conserved sequence, make these inferences highly speculative. nevertheless, our data suggests that, like the arthropods we have analyzed, both nematodes have undergone a greater expansion of gata <dig> paralogs, relative to gata <dig> paralogs.

to evaluate the relationships between the gata factors in the two nematode genomes, we have conducted additional phylogenetic analyses using the complete gene sequences from these two caenorhabditis genomes . this analysis provides clear support for nine common clades of c. elegans and c. briggsae gatas, based upon the ability to define orthology between individual c. elegans and c. briggsae gatas. this suggests that the last common ancestor of these two nematodes possessed at least nine distinct gata genes. furthermore, several nematode gata factors appear to have resulted from more recent duplications within these clades, suggesting their duplication after the divergence of c. elegans and c. briggsae lineages some 80– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . these include c. elegans elt- <dig>  c. briggsae end- <dig>  and the med genes in both species.

we also observed chromosomal linkage of some nematode gata genes. most of the linked genes are the same ones identified as more recent duplicates within single clades that are specific to only one nematode species: the c. elegans elt- <dig> and elt- <dig> genes, as well as the c. briggsae end- <dig> and two of the med genes. some orthologs are linked in both nematode species, including the elt-5/ <dig> and end-1/ <dig> orthologs, indicating a linkage retained from an ancestral rhabditis species. however, these linked genes are from closely related clades, and possess long internal branch lengths suggestive of an evolutionary origin within nematodes. we conclude that the linked nematode gatas originated from more recent nematode and rhabditis specific duplication events, and do not reflect any retention of deeper ancestral gene duplicates.

similar gata family gene number and linkage, but different intron/exon structures, in lophotrochozoans and arthropods
the lophotrochozoan gata complement is similar in copy number to the arthropod gata complement. for example, all of the analyzed lophotrochozoans possessed three or four gata <dig> homologs, and a single gata <dig> homolog . in the flatworm, schmidtea mediterranea, and the limpet, lottia gigantea, we have found three gata <dig> paralogs in a reciprocal best hit blast analysis. the annelid polychaete, capitella capitata, appears to possess an additional gata <dig> homolog. the annelid leech helobdella robusta, has  <dig> predicted gata homologs; however, the number and extreme divergence of these leech gatas relative to other lophotrochozoan genomes appear to make these uninformative in reconstructing the ancestral annelid condition.

as in arthropods, we also identified syntenic relationships of gata <dig> genes in two lophotrochozoan genomes . in lottia, all three of the gata <dig> orthologs are contained within a 45-kilobase region, although the third gene appears to be inverted in orientation compared to the arthropod genes. in capitella, two of the four gata <dig> genes appear in an 11-kilobase region, though linkage to a third gene has not been found. none of the gata genes appear linked in schmidtea, consistent with the relatively degenerate nature of the flatworm gata genes , or perhaps a consequence of the short lengths of the currently available assembled genomic regions.

although similar in number and linkage, it is unclear to what degree the lophotrochozoan and arthropod gata <dig> duplicates can be considered orthologous. no relationships between individual arthropod and lophotrochozoan gata <dig> duplicates are apparent from our molecular phylogenetic analyses.

it is also unclear to what degree these lophotrochozoan gatas are related to one another. the gata456nc genes appear to be orthologous across capitella and lottia in both ml and mb analysis, and the ccapgata456nd is supported as a more recent duplicate of the ccapgata456nc gene in the ml analysis. however, the two well-conserved gata <dig> duplicates from both capitella and lottia  group more closely within each species then across species, suggesting these could be recent lineage-specific duplicates. the sole gata <dig> identified in another polychaete, the platynereis dumerilii pdgata <dig>  does not branch near the other lophotrochozoan gatas, instead branching as the closest outgroup to the arthropod gata <dig> clade. finally, when we examined the intron/exon structure of all of the analyzed annelid , mollusk , and flatworm  gata genes, we found little evidence for the extensive modifications seen for the arthropod gata <dig> homologs . thus, while the orthologous relationships between arthropod gata <dig> factors appear well supported, additional information will be needed to resolve the evolutionary relationships of lophotrochozoan gata <dig> factors.

discussion
we have identified the complete complement of gata factors from nine additional protostome genomes, and we have reconstructed the evolution of protostome gata factors using multiple approaches. our initial estimates of orthology, from reciprocal best hit blast analysis, revealed an expansion of the gata <dig> paralogs in protostomes, while the gata <dig> genes appear to be retained as a single copy. the inclusion of additional arthropod genomes has allowed us to confidently assign the more divergent drosophila gata factors as gata <dig> paralogs. furthermore, we have demonstrated widespread linkage of many gata <dig> duplicates, suggesting a mechanism of gene duplication via tandem duplication events and providing further evidence in support of duplicate-orthology. finally, we infer from changes in intron/exon structure the sequence of gene duplications that produced the gata <dig> paralogs in arthropods.

overview of the evolution of the protostome gatas
we suggest two alternative scenarios for the evolution of the gata transcription factors in protostomes . in the first scenario, the gata <dig> family expanded very early during protostome evolution. in support of this scenario, there are similar numbers of gata <dig> paralogs in lophotrochozoans  and arthropods , even though they each appear to possess single gata <dig> orthologs. furthermore, the chromosomal linkage of gata <dig> paralogs, not only in arthropods but also in the mollusk, lottia, and partially in the annelid, capitella, is suggestive of a deep origin.

however, our analyses more strongly support a second scenario, in which there have been independent duplications of a single gata <dig> ortholog in both arthropods and lophotrochozoans. this second scenario is suggested by the lack of affinities between individual lophotrochozoan and arthropod gata <dig> paralogs in molecular phylogenetic analyses. one possibility is that this cluster arose very close to the lophotrochozoan-ecdysozoan split, allowing little time for sequence divergence and retention of phylogenetic information between the gata <dig> paralogs. nevertheless, the conserved modifications of intron/exon boundaries between orthologous arthropod gata genes suggest that intron loss and gain occurred before the duplication of certain arthropod gata <dig> paralogs . because all but one of the analyzed lophotrochozoan gata <dig> genes have retained the ancestral intron/exon structure, we conclude that either the gata <dig> paralog clusters in lophotrochozoans and arthropods have independent origins, or that gata <dig> genes in arthropods have undergone repeated and convergent intron losses.

orthology and evolutionary birth-order of the arthropod gata gene complement
we have used multiple lines of evidence to determine the origin and relationships of the more degenerate drosophila gata factors. a reciprocal best hit blast analysis suggested that only one  of the five drosophila gatas belongs to the gata <dig> class, while the remaining four are in the gata <dig> class. additionally, in multiple phylogenetic analyses all five drosophila gatas formed single clades with other arthropod homologs, suggesting orthologous relationships between the gata genes within each clade. orthologous genes for each of three fly gata <dig> genes – serpent, gatae, and pannier – are present throughout arthropods. however, the fourth gata <dig> paralog, gatad, appears to be an insect-specific duplicate found only in the beetle, bee, mosquito, and fruitfly genomes.

additional evidence for the orthology of the four arthropod gata <dig> genes comes from the observed conservation of gene order within a gata <dig> paralog cluster among arthropods. the drosophila gata genes serpent, gatae, and pannier are present within a tightly linked cluster, as are their best-hit orthologs in all the arthropod genomes we analyzed. moreover, the relative orientations of these three genes are the same in every analyzed arthropod genome. in contrast, the insect specific gata <dig> gene, orthologous to gatad, is not linked in any of the four analyzed insect genomes. thus, the gene order is consistent with the predicted orthology defined by our phylogenetic analysis.

a third independent line of evidence for the orthologous relationships among arthropod gatas emerged from our comparative analysis of the genomic intron/exon structures. the ancestral condition for the genomic structure of the conserved dual zinc finger domain of gata transcription factors is three exons with conserved intron/exon boundaries, as found in all vertebrate, lophotrochozoan, and cnidarian gatas analyzed. in contrast, arthropod gata <dig> genes exhibit extensive modifications from this ancestral genomic organization. however, the suspected orthologs among the arthropod gata <dig> homologs are united by unique clade specific intron/exon structures.

the observed synteny, as well as the pattern of intron losses and gains of the arthropod gata factors, also provide an explicit mechanism for gene expansion via tandem-duplication and suggest an evolutionary birth order for the gata genes during the expansion from one ancestral to four gata <dig> homologs in arthropods. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  we can infer the following sequence of duplication events. gata456a/gatae and the gata456b precursor would have first arisen from an initial tandem duplication of a gata <dig> gene that possessed the ancestral intron/exon structure. gata456b then lost the second intron, resulting in a secondary state. the subsequent duplication of gata456b formed gata456ba/serpent and gata456bb. gain of a novel second intron by gata456ba/serpent produced a third state. following the divergence of insects from a pancrustacean  ancestor, a duplication of gata456bb generated both the gata456bba/pannier gata456bbb/dmgatad genes. gata456bba genes appear to retain the second state, but the gata456bbb genes appear to have lost the first exon  early.

our analysis shows the utility of such rare genomic changes as additional characters for resolving the relationship between deep branches in gene phylogenies. in this case, combining synteny and gene structure analysis with molecular phylogeny helped to resolve not only the obscure phylogenetic relationships of the highly derived drosophila gata <dig> genes, but also suggests the sequence of gene duplications that produced this gene family in arthropods. this evolutionary scenario makes predictions about the sequences, intron/exon structure, and syntenies of gata <dig> genes within arthropod phylogeny that can now be further tested by obtaining genome sequences from additional arthropods. this scenario also predicts similarities in expression and function of the orthologous gata genes in arthropod development.

the identification of clear arthropod orthologs to drosophila gata factors also allows us to infer the origin of metazoan single-zinc fingered gatas. non-metazoan gata factors, such as the fungal area proteins, generally possess single zinc-fingers, but most metazoan gata factors possess dual zinc fingers. however, some invertebrate gatas  possess only single zinc fingers that might indicate their independent origin from single-zinc fingered ancestors. however, as described above, other arthropods possess orthologs of single finger drosophila genes with two zinc fingers, indicating these genes all arose from dual-zinc fingered ancestral sequences. this conclusion is further supported by molecular phylogenetic analyses suggesting that all metazoan gata factors are equally related to fungal outgroups . finally, we also have been able to identify highly conserved individual amino acids that are diagnostic for individual arthropod orthologs and may be useful for identifying orthologous gata factors in partially sequenced arthropods genomes .

unresolved gata <dig> orthology in other protostome phyla
while we can use both gene sequence and synteny to infer gata <dig> factor phylogeny among arthropods, it remains unclear whether the gata <dig> expansion in arthropods is related to, or independent of those observed in other protostomes. for example, we can define nine caenorhabditis clades, but we have little understanding of how these relate to the four predicted ancestral arthropod gata genes. several of the nematode gata genes are tightly linked, but most of these appear to involve very recent duplications. while sequenced genomes are now becoming available for additional nematode species, currently the data from the well supported c. elegans and c. briggsae gata sequences provide the best platform to launch future inquiries into gata gene family evolution in nematodes.

likewise, we cannot fully resolve how lophotrochozoan gata <dig> paralogs are related to each other, or to drosophila gata <dig> paralogs, despite similar copy-number and linkage. in each of three lophotrochozoan genomes, we identified three or more gata <dig> paralogs. two and three of these gata <dig> paralogs are linked in an annelid  and molluskan  genome, respectively. in our molecular phylogenetic analysis, the ccapgatanc and lgiggatanc form a clade, and are both part of the gata <dig> clusters in either organisms, suggesting these may represent orthologs across molluscs and annelids. however, our molecular phylogenetic analyses fail to define additional relationships for the gata <dig> paralogs in lophotrochozoans, or between lophotrochozoans and arthropods.

additionally, the sequence and expression of four of the five capitella gata factors was recently characterized  <cit> . they name these factors capi-gataa, capi-gatab <dig>  capi-gatab <dig>  and capi-gatab <dig>  which appear to correspond to ccapgata <dig>  ccapgata456na, ccapgata456nc, and ccapgata456nb, respectively. interestingly, the mrna expression of the gata <dig> ortholog was reported to be restricted to ectodermal derivatives, while the expression of the three gata <dig> paralogs was described within nested mesendodermal territories. these results provide additional evidence for a class-specific germ layer expression and expansion of gata <dig> versus gata <dig> transcription factors  <cit> .

one path to resolving gene-family relationships in other protostome phyla is to survey additional taxa, with a focus on slow evolving genomes and appropriate phylogenetic position. a better understanding of the drosophila gata factor evolution was possible only after additional arthropod genomes from suitable phylogenetic branches were included, many of which possessed less derived gata sequences. however, the arthropods currently are an exceptionally well-sampled protostome phylum, and our findings suggest that the current sampling of lophotrochozoan genomes is not sufficient to resolve their gene family evolution. in order to extend our findings in arthropods to other phyla, it will be important to survey additional protostome genomes. several ecdysozoan genomes have been targeted for whole genome sequencing, including those from basal taxa such as tardigrades and priapulids. genome sequences from additional nematode species may help resolve the current ambiguity about the relationships of the caenorhabditis gatas.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified and examined the complete complement of gata factors from nine newly sequenced protostome genomes. we have reconstructed the evolutionary relationships of these protostome gatas using complementary forms of phylogenetic inference, including molecular phylogenetic analysis, genomic linkage and an examination of intron/exon boundaries. our analysis indicates that protostome genomes have a single gata <dig> ortholog, but multiple gata <dig> paralogs. furthermore, by including many arthropod genomes, we have been able to define orthology for the more degenerate drosophila gata factors, including assigning the gatad, gatae, and serpent genes conclusively as gata <dig> co-orthologs. our examination of intron/exon structure modifications suggests a birth order of gata <dig> paralogs, which could not be resolved in molecular phylogenetic analyses. this analysis has also identified similar tightly linked clusters of three gata <dig> orthologs in both arthropods and lophotrochozoans, but additional taxa sampling will be required to define gene family relationships among diverse protostome phyla.
