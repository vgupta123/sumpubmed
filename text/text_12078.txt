BACKGROUND
most insects are chill-susceptible, such that their thermal performance and survival are limited in the cold at temperatures well above the freezing point  <cit> . although ice formation causes direct injury, the mechanisms of chilling injury  are not well-understood. direct cold shock probably causes immediate damage to cells, for example via phase transition in membranes , disruption of the cytoskeleton , or induction of apoptosis  <cit> . indirect chilling injury accumulates over time, most likely resulting from a loss of ion and water balance in the cold  . cold-acclimated insects maintain water and ion homeostasis and avoid chilling injury and mortality to lower temperatures than warm-acclimated conspecifics , although the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood.

chill-susceptible insects lose hemolymph water and na+ to the gut lumen during cold exposure  and re-establish this homeostasis during recovery upon rewarming  <cit> . ion and water homeostasis in insects is primarily regulated at the malpighian tubules and hindgut  <cit> . the distal malpighian tubules actively transport ions across a leaky epithelium to drive secretion of water, metabolic wastes, and other ions into the tubule lumen. this primary urine – which is isosmotic to the hemolymph  <cit>  – is partially modified at the proximal tubule  prior to entering the gut lumen . water and ions are then selectively reabsorbed from the gut lumen by the hindgut   <cit> . na+-k+ atpase  maintains high paracellular  in the rectal epithelium, driving paracellular migration of water  from the gut lumen to the hemolymph. secretion and reabsorption are regulated by a suite of diuretic and antidiuretic peptides , and these peptides may be important for recovery from cold stress in drosophila  <cit> . loss and recovery of ion and water balance in the cold is likely dependent upon processes at the malpighian tubule and hindgut epithelia; specifically, enhanced ion pumping rate at low temperatures could maintain ion balance for longer, and decreased epithelial permeability could reduce the rate of ion leakage.

transport enzyme function is temperature-dependent  <cit> , thus cold exposure should limit ion pumping rates while the rate of passive leak should remain relatively unchanged  <cit> . to compensate, insects could increase transport capacity by expressing or mobilizing more transport enzymes . an obvious hypothesis, then, is that expression or activity of nka and other transport enzymes in the malpighian tubules and hindgut may be targeted for modification during cold acclimation. water and ion leak across the ionoregulatory epithelia during cold exposure will depend on tissue permeability  <cit> , and paracellular pathways may be especially important as these shunts are the primary pathway for water and anion movement across both malpighian tubule and rectal epithelia  <cit> . because paracellular shunts are plastic and may be temperature-sensitive , they are likely targets for modification during cold acclimation to reduce epithelial permeability.

surprisingly few genes have been directly associated with cold tolerance in insects  <cit> , but transcriptomics approaches have revealed many candidates. for example, modified expression of cuticular genes appears to underlie cold tolerance variation among new zealand stick insects  <cit> , and the gene frost has been associated with recovery from cold exposure in drosophila , although its function remains elusive  <cit> . cold shock recovery in sarcophaga bullata flesh flies changes the expression of genes related to the membrane and cytoskeletal structure, apoptosis, protein folding, oxidative stress, and signaling  <cit> , and many of these genes  are also modified with cold acclimation and rapid cold-hardening in d. melanogaster  <cit> . most transcriptomic studies have explored responses to acute cold exposure , or compared natural variation among populations and species whose underlying population differences may render the specific differences that drive cold-related phenotypes difficult to detect . acclimation of a single population is therefore a useful approach to identify candidate mechanisms associated specifically with plasticity of cold tolerance.

a few single - population transcriptomic studies have identified transcriptomic changes associated with cold acclimation, e.g. macmillan et al.  <cit>  and gerken et al.  <cit>  recently identified key pathways and 1000s of genes associated with cold acclimation in drosophila melanogaster. in these drosophila datasets, modification of ion transport  and cellular adhesion is consistent with our expectation that modulating epithelial transport is associated with cold acclimation. however, these and other related studies have examined the transcriptomes of either entire animals , or mixed tissues . because the malpighian tubules and hindgut effectively work antagonistically in insect ion and water balance, transcriptomic shifts in these epithelia are likely to be masked in whole-animal homogenates. thus, a tissue-specific approach to transcriptomics is urgently needed to more precisely determine the cellular- and tissue-level changes underlying cold acclimation in chill-susceptible insects.

the fall field cricket, gryllus pennsylvanicus  is a generalist omnivore of grassy habitats across the eastern north american temperate zone  <cit> . the species is univoltine and overwinters in diapause in the soil as an egg  <cit> . adult g. pennsylvanicus are chill-susceptible: they develop chilling injuries in as little as 12 h at 0 °c, and are killed by 3– <dig> d at this temperature  <cit> . gryllus pennsylvanicus exhibits plasticity in cold tolerance, and has emerged as a model for understanding cold-induced loss of ion and water balance  <cit> . briefly, when these crickets are exposed to cold, na+, ca2+, mg2+, and water migrate from the hemolymph to the gut, hemolymph  rises, and muscle equilibrium potential is lost  <cit> . ion and water balance are actively re-established during recovery from cold  <cit> . cold-acclimated g. pennsylvanicus have improved defense of ion and water homeostasis in the cold, a lowered critical thermal minimum, faster chill coma recovery time, and suffer lower rates of injury and mortality following cold shock  <cit> . thus, the g. pennsylvanicus system is well-suited for exploring mechanisms of cold tolerance plasticity.

here we took a tissue-specific comparative gene expression approach to understand the processes of cold acclimation in the transporting epithelia of chill-susceptible insects. we assembled a transcriptome for g. pennsylvanicus and compared the expression of malpighian tubule and hindgut genes between warm- and cold-acclimated adults . we aimed to generate mechanistic hypotheses about specific molecular underpinnings of cold acclimation, and provide insights into the causes of water and ion disruption during cold exposure.

methods
insect rearing
our colony of g. pennsylvanicus originated from individuals collected in  <dig> from the university of toronto at mississauga campus, ontario and was reared under constant summer-like conditions , as described previously  <cit> . at approximately 8 weeks post-hatch, and prior to sexual maturation, female crickets were separated from males to prevent mating. adult females at approximately 11 weeks post-hatch were used for all experiments.

acclimation and dissection
crickets were first isolated individually in common summer-like conditions  in mesh-covered 177 ml transparent cups  containing egg carton shelters, rabbit food, and water. isolation prevented cannibalism and lasted 1 week. we then haphazardly assigned crickets into cold- and warm-acclimations . for warm acclimation, crickets remained in the rearing growth chamber under constant summer-like conditions. we cold-acclimated crickets in a sanyo mir  <dig> incubator  at 10 l:14 d with temperature decreasing from  <dig> to 12 °c over 7 days followed by constant 12 °c for 3 weeks. this regime lowers the critical thermal minimum c. 2 °c, reduces chill coma recovery time by c. 65%, increases survival following  <dig> d at 0 °c by nearly 80%, and enhances maintenance of ion and water homeostasis in the cold  <cit> . while the two acclimation temperatures are likely to affect physiological ageing, the 4 weeks of acclimation represent approximately 20% of the adult cricket lifespan. therefore we assume that the effect of physiological age on gene expression will be less than the effect of acclimation temperature  <cit> .

cricket hindguts were dissected as described previously  <cit>  from live crickets immediately following the 4 weeks of warm- or cold-acclimation. under ringer’s solution in a petri dish the hindgut  was cut away from the gastrointestinal tract and flushed of fecal material with approximately 3 ml of ringer’s using a syringe . malpighian tubules were removed as a single bunch by detaching the ureter with forceps, rinsing briefly in ringer’s, and blotting on a tissue. malpighian tubules and hindguts were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. three biological replicates for sequencing of hindgut and malpighian tubule transcriptomes were each comprised of pooled tissues from ten individuals. following dissection, crickets were killed by placing them in a freezer at -20 °c. to maximize transcript representation for the de novo assembly, warm- and cold-acclimated whole male and female adult crickets, eggs, and warm-acclimated juveniles were pooled and added to an additional  <dig>  ml microcentrifuge tube and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. all samples were stored at -80 °c until rna extraction.

rna extraction & cdna library preparation
we homogenized thawed tissues with a plastic micropestle  in  <dig>  ml trizol , and extracted rna according to manufacturer’s instructions. we purified rna extracts using the rneasy mini kit  according to manufacturer’s instructions, measured absorbance at 260 nm to determine rna concentrations, and checked for quality with an agilent bioanalyzer. cdna library production and sequencing were performed by the donnelly sequencing center . at  <dig> samples per lane, each cdna library was sequenced twice using the illumina hiseq <dig> platform  with single-end, 50-bp reads.

de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation
we removed illumina adapter sequences and discarded sequences shorter than  <dig> nucleotides or containing unknown bases using the galaxy web service  <cit> . sequenced libraries were then grouped and assembled de novo using trinity release 2012-10- <dig>  <cit>  on the sharcnet computing cluster , with 1 gb jellyfish memory and a minimum contig length criterion of  <dig> nucleotides. we analyzed transcriptome assembly “completeness” compared to a database of arthropod benchmark universal single copy orthologs  using busco v <dig>   <cit> . we compared the contigs from the trinity assembly to the national centre for biotechnology information  non-redundant  protein database  by blastx . gene ontology  annotation  was based on swissprot blast matches using blast2go version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . to filter out transcriptional artifacts, misassembled transcripts, and poorly supported transcripts, we mapped the original cleaned sequence reads back onto the trinity-assembly using bowtie <dig> version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and reassembled them with the cufflinks package version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . we used blast2go  <cit>  and the ncbi database to obtain putative identities and go annotation for mapped transcripts. we accepted one hit for each transcript at an e-value threshold of  <dig> × 10- <dig> 

gene expression analyses
we used normalized read counts of genes in warm- and cold-acclimated hindgut and malpighian tubule libraries for differential gene expression analyses using the edger bioconductor package  <cit>  in r . because each biological replicate was sequenced twice , read counts from these technical replicate libraries were summed for each gene. for analyses we retained only those genes with at least  <dig> counts per million in three of the six libraries being compared   <cit> . filtering yielded  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs for differential gene expression analyses of hindgut and malpighian tubules, respectively. we compared gene expression profiles within tissues , and also compared the hindgut and malpighian tubules for genes that were uniquely up- or downregulated between those tissues with cold acclimation. individual genes were considered differentially expressed if the absolute fold change was ≥  <dig> and if the p-value adjusted for false discovery rate  was <  <dig> .

we used contigs that met our criteria for inclusion  to identify the go terms associated with the responses to cold acclimation in each tissue . differentially-expressed pathways in warm- and cold-acclimated tissues were analyzed using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes . kegg identities were assigned to contigs by the kegg automatic annotation server  <cit> , and differential expression analyses of pathway components were performed using the generally applicable gene-set enrichment  and pathview bioconductor packages  <cit>  in r. these packages identify coordinated differential expression in gene sets   <cit> . we accepted pathways as differentially-expressed if the fdr-adjusted p-value was <  <dig> .

RESULTS
sequencing of  <dig> libraries yielded  <dig> million 50-bp reads, which we assembled into  <dig>  contigs . our transcriptome included  <dig>  complete and  <dig>  fragmented arthropod buscos; which is similar to other recent arthropod transcriptome assemblies , and comparable to, or better than, the transcriptomes referred to by simão et al.  <cit> . approximately 44% of these contigs in our transcriptome had putative identities by blast , and of these approximately 36% aligned to genes of the termite zootermopsis nevadensis. cold acclimation was associated with a two-fold or greater change in  <dig> genes in the hindgut and  <dig> genes in the malpighian tubules . within a given tissue, the number of genes up- and down-regulated with cold acclimation were approximately equal. approximately 52% of all upregulated genes and 60% of all downregulated genes exhibited unique differential expression across the two tissues. eighty-one genes that appear to be important for cold acclimation  were unidentifiable by blast . these represented  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes in the hindgut, and  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes in the malpighian tubules.fig.  <dig> number of genes upregulated, down-regulated, or unchanged in the hindgut and malpighian tubules following cold acclimation. differentially-expressed genes are those with an fdr alpha <  <dig>  and a fold-change >  <dig>  note that due to some overlap in contigs the sum of genes up- or down-regulated across both tissues is less than the sum of genes up- or down-regulated in separate tissues 




the go domain profiles that changed with cold acclimation were similar across the two tissues; of all up- or downregulated go terms, just over half related to ‘molecular function’ , over one third related to ‘biological processes’ , and roughly one tenth were ‘cellular components’ . within the molecular function go domain, genes involved in nucleotide, protein, metal, and ion binding accounted for over 50% of the upregulated transcripts and approximately 30% of downregulated transcripts in both tissues. most of the cellular components that were differentially-expressed with cold acclimation involved the cell membrane and extracellular region. in the malpighian tubules, genes pertaining to the cytoskeleton and cellular junctions accounted for 5% of all upregulated cellular component transcripts, while v-atpase accounted for 2% of the downregulated transcripts. metabolic genes accounted for much of the downregulated biological process transcript counts in both tissues. however, some unique differences in biological process profiles between the two tissues were apparent; approximately 17% of downregulated transcripts in the malpighian tubules were transport-related , compared to just over 8% of downregulated transcripts in the hindgut. of the upregulated biological processes over 30% of transcripts in the hindgut involved stress response, protein folding, and repair, while over 10% of transcripts in the malpighian tubules related to transport.

hindgut
cold-acclimated g. pennsylvanicus had altered expression of putative gene orthologs related to apoptosis, the cytoskeleton, detoxification and repair, ion transport and ph regulation, phosphorylation, protein folding, and signal transduction in the hindgut . a complete list of differentially-expressed genes in the hindgut is provided in the additional file 2: spreadsheet s <dig>  upregulated genes involved in water and ion balance included those encoding atrial natriuretic peptide-converting enzyme, nka α-subunit, and a ca2+ release-activated ca2+ channel protein, while downregulated genes included those putatively encoding bumetanide-sensitive na+-cl+ channel , carbonic anhydrase  isozymes  <dig> and  <dig>  and a mitochondrial na+-h+ exchanger . a gene encoding the putative microtubule-associated protein jupiter increased during cold acclimation, while a putative enzyme involved in homeoviscous adaptation – ∆ <dig> desaturase  <dig> – was downregulated  <dig> -fold. the genes most differentially-expressed in cold-acclimated crickets related to repair and oxidative damage included those encoding cytochrome p <dig>  and a putative cytochrome p <dig> cyp <dig> , glutathione-s-transferase , and vitellogenin . cold acclimation corresponded with altered expression of hindgut heat shock proteins , and altered expression of some apoptosis genes. cold-acclimated crickets also exhibited upregulation of a number of protein kinases, phosphodiesterases, and adenylate cyclase in the hindgut. circadian genes per, clock, and nocturnin were upregulated with cold acclimation, while timeless was downregulated.table  <dig> selected genes upregulated in the hindgut following cold acclimation whose putative function in relation to cold tolerance is discussed in the text

more kegg pathways in the hindgut were downregulated with cold acclimation than were upregulated . among  <dig> upregulated pathways, ‘adherens junction’  and ‘gap junction’ are likely to be directly relevant to ion and water balance. actin regulation within the ‘adherens junction’ pathway was modified; some genes putatively encoding actin-associated proteins  were upregulated while others were downregulated . the putative proteins vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase , transforming growth factor β <dig> , and partitioning defective protein  <dig>  were also upregulated. upregulation of the ‘gap junction’ pathway was driven by increased expression of a gene putatively encoding tubulin α , and to some degree epidermal growth factor receptor , while the gene encoding protein kinase c α  was downregulated. many of the  <dig> downregulated kegg pathways in the hindgut were related to metabolism, but also included ‘cardiac muscle contraction’  and ‘synaptic vesicle cycle’. downregulation of the ‘cardiac muscle contraction pathway’ was driven by a decrease in expression of the gene encoding cytochrome c reductase, however there were also significant increases in the expression of genes encoding the nka α subunit, tropomyosin  <dig>  and myosin heavy chain 6/ <dig>  downregulation of the ‘synaptic vesicle cycle’ was driven by a reduction in the expression of the putative proton pump , however the gene encoding the dynamin gtpase increased.fig.  <dig> heat map of differentially-expressed kegg pathways in the hindgut and malpighian tubules following cold acclimation. upregulated pathways are given in orange and downregulated pathways are given in blue. each heat map contains three column indicating three cold-acclimated biological replicates  each compared to the mean expression among warm-acclimated replicates. for a complete description of each pathway, see the kegg online resource

malpighian tubules
as in the hindgut, the malpighian tubules of cold-acclimated crickets had altered expression of genes related to apoptosis and autophagy, the cytoskeleton, detoxification and repair, ion transport, ph regulation, phosphorylation and signal transduction, and protein folding . a complete list of differentially-expressed genes in the malpighian tubules is provided in additional file 2: spreadsheet s <dig>  differentially-expressed genes involved in ion balance and ph regulation included a putative v-atpase , ca2+ and anion transporters and, as in the hindgut, a downregulation of both ca  <dig> and  <dig>  cold acclimation led to variable expression of multiple cytoskeletal genes, increased expression of two apoptosis genes, and decreased expression of one gene involved in autophagosome formation. similar to the hindgut, cold-acclimated malpighian tubules also exhibited increased expression of hsp  <dig> and downregulation of hsp 67b, and both up- and downregulation of multiple repair and antioxidant genes . multiple kinase genes were upregulated in cold-acclimated malpighian tubules  in addition to a relatively large decrease  in putative inositol monophosphatase expression. altered expression of circadian genes following cold acclimation were also similar to that of the hindgut, and juvenile hormone expression was reduced nearly 11-fold.table  <dig> selected upregulated genes in the malpighian tubules following cold acclimation whose putative function in relation to cold tolerance is discussed in the text

similar to patterns in the hindgut, more kegg pathways were downregulated than were upregulated in cold-acclimated malpighian tubules . many of the  <dig> upregulated pathways were involved in signaling, and most of the  <dig> downregulated pathways related to metabolism. the ‘cardiac muscle contraction’ pathway  was downregulated based on reduced expression of a cytochrome c reductase gene. unlike in the hindgut, nka, tropomyosin, or myosin heavy chain components of this pathway were not upregulated in malpighian tubules. the ‘synaptic vesicle cycle’ pathway exhibited downregulation overall , however a number of genes involved in endocytosis and vesicle-membrane fusion were upregulated. these upregulated genes include those encoding putative n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor , dynamin, ap <dig> complex α , and syntaxin 1a .

discussion
cold-acclimated gryllus pennsylvanicus exhibited modified expression of a range of genes, the functions of which were broadly consistent with differentially-regulated genes associated with cold acclimation and rapid cold-hardening in drosophila  <cit> . in crickets, genes involved in stress response, protein folding, and repair were prominent in cold acclimated hindguts, while cold acclimation in the malpighian tubules was associated with shifts in transport-related genes. in both tissues, cold acclimation was accompanied by altered expression of genes encoding components of the membrane and extracellular space.

water balance
only one gene with known function in insect water homeostasis – that encoding atrial natriuretic peptide-converting enzyme – was upregulated in the hindgut following cold acclimation. the mosquito homologs of this enzyme stimulate primary urine production by the malpighian tubules by increasing secretion of na+ and cl-  <cit> ; the role of this peptide in the insect hindgut is less certain, but increased na+ and cl- transport could enhance water reabsorption  <cit>  and help to defend hemolymph volume during cold exposure. although some aquaporins have been associated with insect freeze tolerance , their role in cold acclimation among chill-susceptible insects is unknown, and none of the water-transporting insect aquaporins  <cit>  were differentially-expressed in the hindgut or malpighian tubules with cold acclimation.

ion transport
cold acclimation corresponded with altered expression of putative nka, nkcc, ca, nha, and v-atpase–encoding genes, which are typically enriched in insect transporting epithelia  <cit> . most of these gene expression changes were observed in the hindgut. although all of these transport enzymes contribute to primary urine production by the malpighian tubules  <cit> , cold-acclimated malpighian tubules only exhibited downregulation of genes encoding v-atpase and cas  <dig> and  <dig> 

ca catalyzes the hydration of co <dig> to produce h+ + hco3
-, a source of protons for export by apical v-atpase by the malpighian tubules  <cit> , which  drives passive excretion of water and anions  <cit> . downregulation of ca <dig> , ca <dig> , and v-atpase in the malpighian tubules during cold acclimation could therefore have an antidiuretic effect, perhaps defending hemolymph volume in the cold. indeed, cold-acclimated g. pennsylvanicus malpighian tubules produce primary urine more slowly .

paracellular na+ gradients across the rectal pads drive passive reabsorption of water against osmotic gradients  <cit> . failure of nka to maintain these na+ gradients during cold exposure could account for leak of na+, and consequently water, to the gut. we might therefore expect cold-acclimated crickets to compensate for slower enzyme pumping rates at low temperatures by increasing nka protein abundance; indeed, expression of the α  subunit of nka increased nearly 3-fold in the cricket hindgut after cold acclimation. in d. melanogaster, cold acclimation decreases whole-body nka activity  <cit> , suggesting a decoupling of na+ gradients across the gut rather than compensation for slowed nka activity in the cold  <cit> . however, it is unclear how nka activity changes in d. melanogaster ionoregulatory tissues specifically, so we cannot unequivocally suggest that diptera and orthoptera use different acclimation strategies with regards to na+ balance. nkcc  was downregulated in cold-acclimated cricket hindguts, but the role of nkcc in insect hindgut transport has received little attention, making it difficult to evaluate how nkcc regulation might modify homeostasis.

cell junctions and structure
cold acclimation was associated with altered expression of cell and tissue structure-related genes , which could indicate a modified rectal pad epithelium, and which we hypothesise would enhance cold tolerance by minimizing na+ and water leak in the cold  <cit> . in addition to possible roles in providing protons for ion transport, ca <dig> may have roles in cellular adhesion  <cit> , proliferation, and differentiation . thus, ca <dig> downregulation in hindgut and malpighian tubules during cold acclimation may affect epithelial transport by increasing cellular adhesion and epithelial tightness. tissue-specific post-translational modification of ca <dig> is an important means of regulating ca <dig> activity  <cit> , which would not be captured in a transcriptome comparison such as the present study.

cold-acclimated crickets had altered expression of hindgut cellular adhesion components associated with both adherens and septate junctions, which comprise the bulk of paracellular connections in the rectal pad , and are closely related  <cit> . cold acclimation was also associated with differential expression of genes encoding actin-membrane anchors, which could influence cell junction characteristics or cell shape. we hypothesise that altered actin-membrane anchoring could reduce tension, shearing damage, or unwanted stretch-activation of membrane-bound ion channels  <cit>  when the gut is distended by water migration during cold exposure.

some gap and tight junction components were also altered during cold acclimation. these will likely modify ion and water recycling between the cytoplasm and paracellular channels  <cit> , and selectivity of absorption  <cit> . upregulation of par <dig>  <cit>  and downregulation of pkc-α  <cit>  suggests increased tight junction formation and therefore increased tightness of the hindgut epithelium during acclimation; we suggest that changes in tight junction morphology in the rectal pads following acclimation could be confirmed by transmission electron microscopy or immunostaining  <cit> . after cold acclimation, we also observed shifts in the expression of multiple malpighian tubule genes involving the cytoskeleton and cell junctions   <cit> . whether these structural changes affect ion and water balance requires some assessment of malpighian tubule permeability following cold acclimation.

chilling injury
cold-attributed oxidative stress, disruption of homeostasis and signaling, protein mis-folding, and loss of membrane and cytoskeletal integrity may all contribute to chilling injury and mortality in chill-susceptible insects . cold acclimation was associated with upregulation of putative apoptosis genes , as well as shifts in autophagy-related gene expression . we hypothesize that the ability to clear cold-damaged cells or cell components is likely increased in cold-acclimated crickets. polymorphisms or shifts in the expression of genes associated with apoptosis and autophagy appear to be common to the rapid cold-hardening process  <cit> , and response to dehydration  <cit>  in other insects.

the cytoskeleton depolymerises at low temperatures in fish, mammals, and insects  <cit> , and damage to the cytoskeleton could well be associated with chilling injury in insects. water loss – which occurs during cold exposure in chill-susceptible species – appears to drive shifts in cytoskeletal gene expression in other insects  <cit> . cold-acclimated crickets had altered expression of cytoskeletal branching and stabilizing genes, such as α-catenin, arp2/ <dig> , and  tropomyosin, microtubule protein jupiter and map1a/b. together, this suggests enhanced polymerisation and stabilization of actin and microtubules. cytoskeleton-related genes were also upregulated in cold-acclimated culex pipiens  <cit> , delia antiqua  <cit> , alfalfa   <cit> , and d. melanogaster  <cit> .


cold exposure appears to cause oxidative stress  <cit> , and cold acclimation is associated with increased activity or expression of antioxidants  in a number of insects . we observed increased expression of some putative dna repair, and glutathione-s-transferase genes in both the hindgut and malpighian tubules after cold acclimation . insects often upregulate antioxidant expression during rewarming  <cit> , so it is possible that a larger suite of antioxidants may become relevant if expression is also modified after cold exposure.

cold acclimation was associated with increased expression of hsp  <dig> in both tissues . heat shock proteins have a range of cellular-protective roles including as protein chaperones, and could therefore protect against a many aspects of thermal stress and maintain cellular integrity  during and after cold exposure. in cold-acclimated d. melanogaster, hsp  <dig> is one of the few upregulated genes that also increases in protein abundance  <cit> . genes encoding several hsps were downregulated, including the less-characterized hsp β <dig>  and hsp 67b <dig> , which may protect against heat and oxidative stress in drosophila  <cit> .

other candidate genes
membrane remodelling is likely an important aspect of cold acclimation  <cit> , and a large proportion of differentially-expressed go cellular components in the cold-acclimated malpighian tubules and hindgut were membrane-associated. in the hindgut, a gene encoding ∆ <dig> desaturase  was downregulated with cold acclimation. by contrast, cold acclimation in the flies belgica antarctica and delia radicum is associated with upregulation of ∆ <dig> desaturase  <cit> . changes in membrane composition and fluidity with cold acclimation have not been explored in g. pennsylvanicus.

loss of signal transduction in the cold is a proposed mechanism of chill coma, and recent evidence suggests that paralysis during cold exposure results from direct inhibitory effects of low temperature on neuromuscular function  <cit> . the expression of some signal transduction and neurotransmission genes  was altered with cold acclimation in crickets, however it is difficult to predict how these changes would enhance cold tolerance. perhaps of greater interest were vesicle localization and fusion genes such as dynamin , nsf , ap <dig> , and syntaxin 1a , all of which were upregulated with cold acclimation. vesicle-membrane localization is important for both neurotransmission and recruitment of ion transporters , and is likely slowed in the cold.

cold acclimation appears to affect the expression of some genes associated with circadian rhythm, storage and metabolism, development, and phosphorylation. differential expression of circadian genes was likely a result of the cold . the expression of hindgut genes encoding vitellogenin  was drastically lower with cold acclimation, and this also occurs in cold-acclimated d. melanogaster  <cit> ; in this case, we suspect that vitellogenin mrna came from traces of fat body remaining on the gut during dissections  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have assembled the first transcriptome of gryllus pennsylvanicus and our tissue-specific comparative approach yielded precise mechanistic hypotheses about the cold acclimation process. cold acclimation appears to involve a modification of both ion transport function and cellular/junctional integrity . the ion transport modifications likely defend hemolymph volume in the cold; decreased malpighian tubule v-atpase and ca expression should slow primary urine production, while upregulation of hindgut nka should increase na+ and water reabsorption. remodeling of the cytoskeleton and adherens junctions  may mitigate paracellular leak of water and ions in both the hindgut and malpighian tubules. cold-acclimated crickets may prevent direct chilling injury by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton and by changing the way in which actin anchors to the membrane. to repair chilling injuries, cold-acclimated insects may increase expression of antioxidant, dna repair, apoptosis, autophagy, and chaperone genes. upregulation of nka  may also account for faster chill coma recovery in cold-acclimated insects.fig.  <dig> candidate mechanisms of cold acclimation in gryllus pennsylvanicus. a increased expression of nka in rectal pad epithelia should increase na+ and water reabsorption; this may counteract leak of water and ions and aid in chill coma recovery). b downregulation of ca and v-atpase expression in the malpighian tubules should slow primary urine production, thereby retaining hemolymph volume. c cytoskeletal and junctional remodelling of the hindgut may mitigate water and ion leak during cold exposure
