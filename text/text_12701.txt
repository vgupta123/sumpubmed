BACKGROUND
the growing problem of resistance of microorganisms to current antibiotics has fostered the search for novel antimicrobial therapies  <cit> . particularly interesting are antimicrobial peptides  discovered as components of unspecific innate mechanisms of infection fighting in humans and animals  <cit> . amps play a crucial role in innate immune systems of invertebrates, which do not have an adaptive immunity. insects protect themselves from pathogens and parasites via a powerful innate immune system. insect innate immune responses include cellular and humoral responses, and humoral responses contain melanization and synthesis of antimicrobial peptides . the insect immune responses are based on: the recognition of the pathogen as nonself, the induction of suitable genes and biochemical pathways that result in the production of a potent arsenal of low molecular weight amps  <cit> . most of these peptides  are produced in the fat body or haemocytes of the insect and released into the haemolymph. insect amps are divided into three groups in accordance to their amino acid sequence and structural features:  cecropins which are linear peptides that form α-helix and lack cysteine residues;  defensins which have a characteristic six to eight conserved cysteine residues that form a stabilizing array of three or four intramolecular disulfide bridges and three domains consisting in a flexible amino-terminal loop, a central α-helix and a carboxyl-terminal antiparallel β-sheet  <cit> ; and  peptides with an overrepresentation of proline and/or glycine residues, e.g., lebocins and moricins  <cit> .

defensins have been isolated from fungi, plants, insects, mussels, birds, and various mammals. they are predominantly active against gram  bacteria, and a few of them are also active against gram  bacteria and fungi. regarding the spacing pattern of cysteines, defensins are divided into plant, invertebrate, α, β-, and -subfamilies  <cit> . all insect defensins belonging to the invertebrate class have a consensus motif, c-x5-16-c-x3-c-x9-10-c-x4-7-cx1-c. to date, hundreds of amps have been described in insects and a lot of different nucleotide and amino acid defensin or defensin-like sequences from many insect species were registered by ncbi data base. however, only seven authors reported the presence of defensin-like peptides in lepidoptera  <cit> . several amps have already been found in different species of spodoptera. these include moricins, cecropins and defensin, but no report was published on the isolation of defensin from the egyptian cotton leafworm, spodoptera littoralis. therefore, the main objective of the present research was to investigate the immune responses of the egyptian s. littoralis, to bacterial challenge. here we report the isolation, sequence characterization, phylogenetic analysis, antimicrobial activity and expression profile of a defensin gene from the haemolymph of s. littoralis.

RESULTS
differential display  using primers corresponding to well known defense genes
as the identification of the induced antibacterial genes was the main objective of this study, differential display technique was used to characterize the genetic variation  between bacterial-challenged and control s. littoralis. figure  <dig> shows the results of differentially displayed cdnas of bacterial-challenged and control insects using  <dig> primers  corresponding to well known defense genes. haemolymph samples were differentially displayed at  <dig>   <dig> and/or  <dig> h post-infection  with s. aureus, s. sanguinis and e. coli bacterial strains. it was observed that s. aureus-challenged insects died  <dig> h p.i., e. coli-challenged insects died  <dig> h p.i. and s. sanguinis-challenged insects died  <dig> h p.i. differential display results revealed that the average number of bands per sample was  <dig>  bands. the total number of bands resolved in  <dig> % agarose gel for both control and challenged insects was  <dig> .  <dig> polymorphic bands  were differentially displayed with  <dig> of the used primers. eight reproducible, treatment-induced bands were cloned and sequenced using m <dig> universal primer.

all oligonucleotides were synthesized by invitrogen, usa and hplc purified.

primer design, rt-pcr amplification and cloning of defensin gene
specific primers for the full length and mature peptide of defensin gene were designed. these primers would be used later in the following reactions during this study. nucleotide sequence of the used primers was illustrated in table  <dig>  pcr was optimized for each primer set and primers successfully produced positive pcr amplicons of  <dig> and  <dig> bp for the full length and mature peptide sequences, respectively . the full length fragment includes one open reading frame  of defensin gene  -  <dig> ). subsequently this segment  was cloned into pcr-topo vector  and transformed cells were tested with pcr using the same primers . using this screening method, clone pcr-toposplidef was tested as positive . a pcr product corresponding to the mature defensin peptide was also cloned into pproextm hta expression vector and transformed dh5α cells were tested as positive .

nucleotide sequence and sequence analyses
nucleotide sequences of splidef and its deduced amino acid sequence are shown in figure  <dig>  a single orf that could encode a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids was detected for splidef. one stop codon was found at the 3' end of the sequence. the flanking region of the initiation codon atg is ataatgag, and the length of  <dig> untranslated region was  <dig> bp before the poly  track . tata box as well as gata, il-6-re, and catt recognition sites were detected in the sequence of promoter region of defensin  <dig> bp upstream from the start codon. the putative polyadenylation sequence aataaaa was located  <dig> bp downstream from the stop codon . the identified defensin orf includes signal peptide , propeptide  and mature peptide . the deduced splidef polypeptide  contains  <dig> strongly basic,  <dig> strongly acidic,  <dig> hydrophobic and  <dig> polar amino acids. the calculated molecular masses of the full length and mature defensins, were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively, and the calculated isoelectric points  were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the net charges at ph  <dig>  were  <dig>  and - <dig> , respectively. the defensin prepropeptide was less stable :  <dig> ) than its mature peptide . ratios of hydrophilic residues were  <dig> and 30% for prepropeptide and mature defensin peptide, respectively.

on comparing splidef nucleotide sequence  to s. frugiperda defensin and spodoptericin, t. ni defensin and st. albicosta sequence ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> different nucleotides; zero, zero, one and  <dig> gaps; and  <dig>   <dig>  zero and zero additions were observed throughout the compared dna segments .

in addition, the deduced amino acid sequence of splidef was blasted to all defensin-related sequences in genbank database. blast search created significant alignment with  <dig> insect-published peptide sequences . the splidef putative peptide exhibited 96% identity with s. frugiperda defensin and  <dig> spodoptericins , 67% identity with  <dig> bombyx mori defensin-like proteins ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48% identity with the defensins of t. ni, manduca sexta, lutzomyia longipalpis and anopheles sp. , and 31% identity with both drosophila yakuba mrna products .

on comparing amino acid sequence of the putative polypeptide of splidef  to its corresponding sequences of b. mori, s. frugiperda, s. frugiperda spodoptericin, s. frugiperda spodoptericin, t. ni, g. mellonella, mamestra brassicae, m. sexta, d. melanogaster, copris tripartitus, apis cerana cerana and rhodnius prolixus ,  <dig> conserved cysteine residues were observed throughout the  <dig> compared putative polypeptides . it is noteworthy to mention that splidef amino acid sequence contains  <dig> cysteine residues . these are comparable to m. brassicae and c. tripartitus conserved cysteine motifs . b. mori and a. cerana defensins were observed to have only  <dig> conserved cysteine motifs. meanwhile, all other compared defensins contains more than  <dig>  conserved cysteine motifs . the spacing pattern of splidef six-cysteine residues motif was c-x10-c-x3-c-x9-c-x4-c-x1-c, which was consistent with the consensus motif of invertebrate defensins. in addition to the precise conservation of the six cysteines, at least six residues within the cysteine motif of splidef, his <dig>  leu <dig>  lys <dig>  gly <dig>  tyr <dig> and gly <dig> were found to be conserved at equivalent positions in the sequences of some other insect defensins .

primary, secondary structure analyses, post-translational modifications and topology predictions revealed that amino acid sequence of the putative splidef peptide has  <dig> signal peptide cleavage sites , three o-glcnacylated residues  and one potential glycated lysine at position  <dig>  two phosphorylation sites  and  <dig>  kinase specific phosphorylation sites  were predicted.

phylogenetic analyses of the splidef sequence
phylogenetic analyses have been performed on the splidef nucleotide seuquence and its deduced polypeptide and the results of these analyses are shown in figure  <dig>  in the case of splidef nucleotide seuquence, a phylogenetic tree was generated from  <dig> defensin-related sequences  by neighbor-joining distance analysis with maximum sequence difference  <dig>  . the topology shows two distinct lineages including  <dig>  and  <dig>  defensin-related sequences, respectively. the maximum nucleotide sequence divergence was exhibited in the first lineage . meanwhile, the defensin sequences appear in the other lineage as less divergent clades . the splidef was clustered with other  <dig> lepidopteran sequences, s. frugiperda defensin , spodoptericins  and s. albicosta , in a monophyletic sister clade . meanwhile, the other  <dig> lepidopteran sequences were diverged in different phylogenetic clades . in the case of splidef deduced amino acid seuquence, a phylogenetic tree was generated from sequence data of  <dig> published sequences  by neighbor-joining distance analysis with maximum sequence difference  <dig>  . the topology shows two distinct lineages including  <dig>  and  <dig>  defensin peptides, respectively. the maximum divergence of amino acid sequences was exhibited in lineage ii . however, less divergence was observed in the other lineage . the splidef putative peptide was clustered with other  <dig> lepidopteran  and one dipteran  defensins in a monophyletic sister clade . meanwhile, the 5th lepidopteran sequence was grouped in a different phylogenetic group .

quantitative protein analysis
quantitative protein analysis of the crude haemolymph of control and bacterial-challenged s. littoralis was determined at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. . statistical analysis of data revealed that the increase of total protein content in the case of bacterial-challenged insects was significant at all the tested times. df, f and p values were illustrated in table  <dig>  the expected antibacterial peptide concentration in the haemolymph of bacterial-challenged insects was increasing smoothly with the time and an abrupt peak was observed at  <dig> h p.i. in addition, the total protein concentration of iptg-induced, non-induced transformed e. coli and ni-affinity purified defensin mature peptide was determined at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. . the protein concentration increased with the time course reaching maximum at  <dig> h p.i. statistical analysis of data revealed that the difference of protein content  in the case of iptg-induced and non-induced cells was significant at all the tested times. f and p values were illustrated in table  <dig>  the quantity of protein lost by purification  was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h p.i., respectively. this loss was statistically significant  in all the tested cases.

rt-qpcr
splidef transcript profiles from larval haemolymph of the control and the bacterial-challenged s. littoralis were compared at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. using rt-qpcr . the splidef gene was up-regulated by bacterial-challenge at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. . statistically significant changes were observed between the control and the treated samples at  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. . notably, it was more than 41-folds up-regulated at  <dig> h p.i. no statistically significant change was observed between the control and the treated samples at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h p.i. .

discussion
in the present study, dd-pcr revealed that several common bands were observed in both control and challenged samples . very few bands were recorded in control insects and disappeared in challenged ones . on the other hand, many bands were induced as a result of bacterial-challenge at different time intervals post-infection. dd-pcr technique is considered a powerful genetic screening tool for complicated dynamic tissue processes, particularly when multiple, limited-sized samples are involved, because it allows for simultaneous amplification of multiple arbitrary transcripts  <cit> . this technique has been developed as a tool to detect and compare altered gene expression in eukaryotic cells  <cit> , to screen mrnas, and to characterize differentially expressed mrnas  <cit> . many publications described the enhancement of the insect immune system and induction of amps due to stress and/or bacterial challenge  <cit> . although defensin genes were isolated from six insect orders; lepidoptera, diptera, coleoptera, hymenoptera, hemiptera and thysanura, the lepidopteran defensin-like genes included both the smallest , acc# aas19170) and the largest , acc# aam96925) molecular-sized defensin genes isolated from class insecta. thus, the orf of splidef  was comparable in size to that of other spodoptera sp. defensin-like genes .

reconstruction of the phylogenetic trees of the splidef nucleotide seuquence and its deduced polypeptide resulted in two different topologies. in spite of constructing two different tree topologies, both trees clustered the splidef sequence with that of s. frugiperda to indicate that they descend from a common ancestor. the grouping of some lepidopteran and dipteran defensins  in one sister clade indicated that they may be homologous or share some similarity. in addition, the lepidopteran defensin-like sequences were diverged in many sister clades as nucleotides but they were clustered in a monophyletic group as amino acids due to the difference in codon usage in the different insect species.

although three signal peptide cleavage sites were detected, the most probable site is between positions 23- <dig>  the detected glycosylation and glycation residues may serve for correct folding and stability of the protein. it was shown that the unglycosylated protein degrades quickly. glycosylation may also play a role in cell-cell adhesion , as well  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> phosphorylation sites were identified. reversible phosphorylation of proteins  is considered an important regulatory mechanism that occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . it is very important in protein-protein interaction via recognition domains  <cit> , . it may also result in a conformational changes in the structure of many peptides, causing them to become activated, deactivated or degraded  <cit> .

spacing pattern of our anionic defensin revealed a possible frameshift mutation of at least six residues within the conserved cysteine motif of splidef  in comparison to  of bmdefa  <cit> . numbers refer to the prepropeptide sequence of a defensin. the first two anionic defensins of amblyomma hebraeum were reported by lai et al.  <cit> . similar properties were reported by wen et al.  <cit>  for a novel anionic defensin peptide  isolated from b. mori. these results were contrary to almost all known defensins, which were described as cysteine-rich cationic amps [e.g.  <cit> .

although most insect defensins are active against gram  bacteria, the purified mature splidef exhibited activity against both gram  and gram  bacteria. according to shai-matsuzaki-huang  model, antibacterial activity was ascribed to the interaction between the positively charged amps and the negatively charged microbial membrane components, which include lpss in gram  bacteria and polysaccharides in gram  bacteria  <cit> . however, this model has difficulty explaining the behaviours of anionic defensins like splidef. for example, the amblyomma defensin- <dig> contains a net negative charge with a pi value of  <dig> , and exerts antimicrobial activity against the gram  bacterium e. coli and the gram  bacterium s. aureus  <cit> . this suggests that anionic defensins might possess some novel antimicrobial mechanisms; although no convincing evidence is available until date. as the knowledge of anionic defensins is still poorly known, it is of interest to investigate the properties of the splidef.

sequence motifs similar to the binding sites of tata, catt, il-6-re, and gata transcription factors in mammals were found in promoter region of our sequence and almost in all genes that are up-regulated after immune challenge  <cit> . tata, catt, il-6-re, and gata boxes were found adjacent to each other indicating that they work cooperatively in the transcriptional activation of the splidef gene as previously described in cecropin a <dig> gene in drosophila  <cit> . our results also showed that the relative transcription levels of splidef were up-regulated after bacterial-challenge, indicating the involvement of the splidef gene in immune responses of the egyptian cotton leafworm, s. littoralis. the expression of splidef in haemocytes peaks at  <dig> h p.i. and gradually declines with time. these results were supported by the quantitative protein analysis which revealed the significant peak of increase at  <dig> h post-infcetion. kaneko et al.  <cit>  reported that the expression of bmdefensinb in fat body tissue of b. mori peaks at  <dig> h p.i. and declines with time. ceraul et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the expression of two defensin isoforms in midgut and fat body tissues of the hard tick dermacentor variabilis peak at  <dig> h p.i. with rickettsia and gradually decline with time. the expression peak in fat body tissue may be retarded to be at  <dig> h p.i. in the case of defensin- <dig>  lopez et al.  <cit>  found that the defensin expression pattern in fat body of bacteria-injected rhodnius prolixus tissue is higher than in the intestinal tissue. this pattern may be due to the fact that the expression of defensin gene in deferent body tissues depends on the consequences of infection course of a pathogen .

CONCLUSIONS
our current results provide a typical anionic insect defensin gene  with a possible frameshift mutation. splidef plays an important immune role in s. littoralis by cooperating with other amps to control bacterial infection and it dominates at  <dig> h p.i. these findings would be helpful in defensin studies concerning elisa, pcr and other related molecular and immunological techniques.
