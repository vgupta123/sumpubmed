BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram negative member of the enterobacteriaceae family that commonly causes nosocomial pneumonia, bacteriaemia, urinary tract infections and wound infections  <cit> . in recent years the treatment of k. pneumoniae infections has become more challenging due to the greater prevalence of multiple antibiotic resistant strains  <cit> . moreover, hypervirulent, pyogenic liver abscess-causing k. pneumoniae strains that infect otherwise healthy individuals have emerged from initial endemic foci in taiwan and china, and are now spreading into north america and europe  <cit> . this highlights the increasing threat that k. pneumoniae poses to public health and the importance of elucidating its mechanisms of pathogenesis.

most k. pneumoniae strains possess a thick polysaccharide capsule which is involved in protection from opsonisation and phagocytosis and is a well recognized in vivo virulence factor  <cit> . various studies have also highlighted roles for surface-exposed lipopolysaccharides, multiple iron acquisition systems and adhesins in k. pneumoniae infection  <cit> . several strain-specific virulence determinants of the pyogenic liver abscess-associated isolate k. pneumoniae ntuh-k <dig> have been well characterised  <cit> . however, the functions of strain-specific genomic regions in k. pneumoniae strains associated with other types of infection remain poorly studied.

comparative analyses using computational and in vitro experimental techniques have shown that k. pneumoniae strains possess an extremely plastic genome that consists of a conserved core genome interspersed by strain-specific accessory components  <cit> . this was further highlighted in a recent study which calculated that only  <dig> % of known k. pneumoniae genes were shared by three sequenced isolates   <cit> . genomic islands , typically ranging from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb in size and frequently inserted within trna gene  hotspots, comprise a substantial proportion of the accessory genome. gi acquisition offers an efficient ‘quantum leap’ based route to gaining virulence factors, antibiotic resistance determinants and/or metabolic pathways pre-tailored for the exploitation of new environments  <cit> .

epidemiological studies have suggested that k. pneumoniae infections are preceded by colonization of the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . adhesion and colonization are essential steps in the infection process and are often mediated by fimbriae, which are small hair-like extensions on the bacterial cell surface that can interact with other surfaces via tip-located adhesin proteins  <cit> . the majority of environmental and clinical k. pneumoniae isolates are known to express type  <dig> fimbriae and type  <dig> fimbriae, which have recently been classified into the γ <dig> and γ4-fimbrial subgroups using the nuccio and bäumler fimbrial classification system, which was created from a large scale phylogenetic analysis of fimbrial usher proteins  <cit> . recent in vivo experiments have demonstrated a role for k. pneumoniae type  <dig> fimbriae in urinary tract infections  <cit> . although type  <dig> fimbriae have been shown to enhance biofilm formation and mediate attachment to bladder epithelium in vitro, the role of these structures in vivo has yet to be determined as an isogenic mrk knockout strain was as virulent as its wildtype parent in murine pneumonia and urinary tract infection models  <cit> .

k. pneumoniae type  <dig> and type  <dig> fimbriae are both thought to assemble via the chaperone/usher  assembly pathway which has been characterised in detail for the archetypal e. coli type  <dig> and p fimbriae  <cit> . some cu fimbriae, such as the kpc fimbriae of k. pneumoniae ntuh-k <dig>  are encoded by only a subset of strains and are thought to potentially correlate with tropism towards particular host tissues and infection types  <cit> . many strain-specific fimbriae are encoded on trna gene-associated gis, best illustrated by the saftcfsefstd and stb fimbrial operons of salmonella enterica serovar typhi strain ct <dig>  this latter strain encodes an arsenal of twelve putative cu fimbrial operons that are hypothesized to correlate with adaptation to the human host  <cit> . the genomes of k. pneumoniae kp <dig>  mgh <dig> and ntuh-k <dig> contain nine, eleven and eight cu fimbrial operons, respectively, though the originally described type  <dig> and type  <dig> fimbrial operons are common to all three  <cit> . apart from the serotype k1-associated kpc operon, no studies have investigated the in vitro and/or in vivo role of other k. pneumoniae accessory fimbrial operons. we now describe the identification, genetic characterization and initial functional analysis of a novel cu fimbrial operon  that is encoded on a previously unidentified gi, kpgi- <dig>  found inserted within the met <dig> trna gene of k. pneumoniae strain kr <dig> 

RESULTS
the kpgi- <dig> genomic island codes for a novel predicted chaperone/usher fimbrial system
whilst screening five trna gene insertion hotspots in sixteen clinical k. pneumoniae isolates for strain-specific dna using a technique called trip-pcr  <cit> , we found that k. pneumoniae kr <dig> possessed an ‘occupied’ met <dig> trna locus. trip-pcr using primers pr <dig> and pr <dig>  which were designed to amplify across the met <dig> trna locus, failed to amplify a product in kr <dig>  single genome-specific primer based walking from the conserved met <dig> upstream flank yielded ~ <dig> kb of novel sequence.

to capture and sequence this entire strain-specific island, we tagged the known trna-proximal arm of the island with a kanamycin resistance cassette using allelic exchange. a fosmid library of this tagged strain  was then created and used to isolate kanamycin resistance cassette-bearing inserts by marker rescue. two overlapping fosmids, pjfos- <dig> and pjfos- <dig>  shown by end-sequencing to span the entire strain-specific region were sequenced to define this novel kr <dig> met56-specific gi that we designated kpgi- <dig> 

kpgi- <dig> is a  <dig>  kb insertion at the met <dig> locus of kr <dig> with many features in common with typical gis. firstly, the calculated g + c content  was much lower than the corresponding genome averaged values of k. pneumoniae mgh <dig>  and kp <dig> . secondly, the island was present downstream of the k. pneumoniae met <dig> gene, which is a proven hotspot for gi integration  <cit> . and finally, the island possessed an almost perfect  <dig> bp direct repeat that corresponded to the 3’ end of met <dig>  however, no putative integrase or mobility-associated genes were identified. open reading frame  and blast analyses were performed on the kpgi- <dig> sequence . the  <dig>  kb segment mapping to the right arm of kpgi- <dig> was 90% identical to a region immediately downstream of met <dig> in k. pneumoniae kp <dig> and was predicted to encode two hypothetical proteins , a metallo-beta-lactamase family protein  and a putative gcn5-related n-acetyltransferase . the nucleotide sequence of a  <dig>  kb central region did not match any genbank entries and coded for three novel proteins; orf <dig> and orf <dig> exhibited weak matches to putative regulatory proteins from the bacteria stigmatella aurantiaca dw4/3- <dig> and serratia odorifera dsm  <dig>  respectively. orf <dig> also possessed a match to the pfam domain trans_reg_c  which has been implicated in dna binding, further suggesting a role for orf <dig> in regulation.

the  <dig>  kb left arm of kpgi- <dig> harboured a novel eight-gene cluster that exhibited sequence similarity and organizational-identity to the chromosomally-encoded fim operons of citrobacter koseri atcc baa- <dig>  and k. pneumoniae c <dig> . this cluster was named fim <dig>  it encoded homologs of all structural and biosynthesis-associated components of the well-characterized c <dig> type  <dig> fimbrial system, including a major fimbrial subunit , three minor fimbrial subunits , and a chaperone  and usher  protein  <cit> . downstream of fim2h was fim2k which encoded a fimk homolog that possessed a matching eal domain but lacked a fimk-equivalent n-terminal helix-turn-helix domain. eal domains have been implicated in the hydrolysis of c-di-gmp, an intracellular messenger that regulates important cellular functions including different forms of motility, adhesin and exopolysaccharide matrix synthesis, fimbrial expression and virulence  <cit> . helix-turn-helix domains are associated with binding to specific dna sequences and in the context of eal domain-bearing proteins are hypothesized to modulate the c-di-gmp hydrolytic activity of these proteins  <cit> . amino acid sequence identities between cognate fim <dig> and fim products varied from  <dig> – 92%. however, no homologs of the c <dig> fimbfime or fims invertible promoter switch could be identified upstream of fim <dig>  k. pneumoniae kr <dig> also possessed the species-conserved fim and mrk operons, as shown by pcr screening for the fimh and mrkd adhesin genes using primer pairs pr1144-pr <dig> and pr1150-pr <dig>  respectively. of note, the g + c content of the fim <dig> operon  was much lower than that of the k. pneumoniae fim operon  and quite distinct from the g + c content of the four fully sequenced k. pneumoniae genomes .

the kpgi- <dig> fim <dig> locus is found within several klebsiella spp. and is globally distributed
to determine the prevalence of fim <dig> in klebsiella spp., a total of  <dig> strains  isolated from distinct sources were pcr screened for fim2k using primers pr615-pr <dig>  in total,  <dig> out of  <dig> strains  were identified to be fim <dig> positive, including 16 k. pneumoniae , three undefined klebsiella spp.  and two k. oxytoca . it must be noted that these species designations are based on biochemical species identifications, which can be problematic in this genus  <cit> .  <dig> %  of fim2-positive k. pneumoniae strains were also found to be mrk- and fim-positive by pcr analysis. however, the distribution of the latter were not investigated in other klebsiella spp. due to recognized species-specific differences in fim and mrk operon sequences  <cit> .

further examination suggested that the specimen type from which strains were obtained was not a predictor of the presence or absence of fim <dig> . notably, fim2-positive strains were not limited to one geographical area. kr <dig>  the index fim2-positive strain, was isolated in the united kingdom, while other fim2-bearing strains were isolated in germany, denmark, usa and china, suggesting a sporadic but global spread of the fim <dig> locus.

fim <dig> genes are expressed under standard in vitro growth conditions
many chaperone/usher operons are poorly expressed under laboratory conditions  <cit> . to investigate fim <dig> expression, rna was isolated from kr <dig>  a streptomycin-resistant derivative of kr <dig>  which had been cultured in lb medium for  <dig> h  and a cdna library constructed using random primer-based rt-pcr. subsequent pcr analysis of this cdna library detected transcripts that corresponded to fim2afim2h and fim2k, while reverse transcriptase-free control reaction mixtures did not yield any products, thus confirming absence of dna carryover . follow-up quantitative-pcr experiments on this kr <dig> cdna library showed that under the growth conditions examined fim2a was expressed approximately 30- and 90-fold less than fima and mrka, respectively . as pcr analysis spanning orf <dig> to fim2a did not yield a product, whilst that linking fim2h to fim2k produced a specific band, it would appear that the eight gene fim <dig> cluster was expressed as a single transcript and that orf <dig> gene was not part of this transcriptional unit . of note, transcripts corresponding to fim2afim2h and fim2k were also detected in kr <dig> grown at 37°c for  <dig> h  in m <dig> minimal media plus  <dig> % glycerol, rpmi  <dig>  rpmi  <dig> plus 10% fetal calf serum and king’s b medium .

heterologous expression of fim <dig> does not result in visualisable host fimbriation
the fim <dig> locus was pcr-amplified from kr <dig> and cloned into the high copy number vector pbluescript ii ks+, the low copy number vector pwsk <dig> and the ptrc-bearing vector pjtool- <dig> to create pfim2-hcn, pfim2-lcn and pfim2-ptrc, respectively. each plasmid was transformed into the afimbriate e. coli strain hb <dig> and examined by electron microscopy in an attempt to visualise the putative fim <dig> fimbriae. despite use of multiple induction methods and over  <dig> cells being viewed per strain, no definite fimbrial structures could be identified on the bacterial surfaces examined. similar results were obtained when the locus was expressed in a fim2-negative k. pneumoniae mutant, c3091ΔfimΔmrk. by contrast, hb <dig> possessing a pjtool- <dig> derivative with the fim operon expressed abundant and highly characteristic type  <dig> fimbriae on its outer surface. notably, despite the absence of detectable fimbriation in e. coli hb101/pfim2-ptrc induced with iptg, major induction-associated growth reduction was observed . hb101/pfim2-ptrc growth inhibition exhibited a distinct dose–response relationship to iptg concentration and this was not evident with the control strains hb <dig> and hb101/pjtool- <dig> . by contrast, over-expression of fim appeared to enhance the growth rate of hb101/pfim-ptrc but had no effect on final cell densities as compared to the above mentioned control strains.

expression of fim <dig> in e. coli hb <dig> appears to enhance biofilm formation
k. pneumoniae readily colonizes and forms biofilms on abiotic surfaces such as urinary catheters and tracheal tubes  <cit> . as surface-expressed structures play a key role in biofilm formation, the ability of kr <dig> and its isogenic mutants to form biofilms was examined. however, absence of fim <dig> and/or fim had no effect on biofilm formation as assayed at  <dig> h under static growth conditions in lb or m <dig> media at either 37°c or 30°c . to detect a potential contribution to biofilm formation that may have been masked by low-level fim <dig> expression or capsule-related physical hindrance of fimbrial function  <cit> , fim <dig> was over-expressed from pfim2-ptrc in e. coli hb <dig> using  <dig>  mm iptg induction. compared to hb <dig> carrying the empty pjtool- <dig> vector, hb101/pfim2-ptrc exhibited similar biofilm formation at  <dig> h on polystyrene wells as assessed by post-washing crystal violet staining . on the other hand, expression of fim <dig> in hb <dig> resulted in marginally denser biofilm in polyvinyl chloride wells as compared to the vector-only control, but this was not statistically significant .

as hb101/pfim2-ptrc grew to a much lower od <dig> at  <dig> h than the other two strains, we also analysed the biofilm data as a ratio of crystal violet staining intensity to the pre-wash od <dig> measurement that reflected total growth. this analysis suggested that the proportion of hb101/pfim2-ptrc cells comprising biofilm growth as opposed to total growth  was almost twice that of hb <dig> and the vector only control strain . indeed, based on this ratio, fim <dig> expression in hb <dig> exerted a highly significant positive impact on biofilm formation on both surfaces . by contrast when fim <dig> was expressed in the mrk- and fim-deficient strain c3091∆fim∆mrk using this same system, no statistically significant accentuation in biofilm formation on either surface was observed .

deletion of fim <dig> does not affect adhesion to human hct- <dig> ileocaecal or  <dig> bladder epithelial cells
in vitro adhesion assays were performed to further investigate whether kr <dig> and its three isogenic mutants  exhibited differing cell adhesion properties. human hct- <dig> ileocecal and human  <dig> bladder epithelial cell lines were chosen to investigate adherence to intestine- and bladder-derived cells, respectively. no significant differences were detectable by these in vitro tissue culture assays . furthermore, despite the previously reported impaired urovirulence of a fim-negative k. pneumoniae strain  <cit> , the kr2107∆fim and kr2107∆fim∆fim <dig> mutants examined in this study did not display any defect in adherence to bladder epithelial cells relative to kr <dig> or kr2107∆fim <dig>  it is possible that fim and/or fim <dig> expression was insignificant under the in vitro conditions used or that the k. pneumoniae capsule interfered with fimbrial function  <cit> .

deletion of fim <dig> does not affect murine intestinal colonization
epidemiological studies have elucidated that the first step in the majority of k. pneumoniae infections is gastrointestinal tract colonization  <cit> . to investigate whether fim <dig> influences this initial step, a 1: <dig> mixture of kr <dig> and kr2107∆fim <dig> was fed to three mice and faecal cfu counts were monitored for  <dig> days. to exclude potential type  <dig> fimbriae-related masking, a competition experiment between kr2107∆fim and kr2107∆fim∆fim <dig> was also performed. as assessed by faecal cfu counts, no strain exhibited an obvious competitive advantage and all four strains were found to readily colonize the large intestine in similar numbers  throughout the experiment . apart from confirming that fim does not affect intestinal colonization  <cit> , these results also suggested that fim <dig> does not play a significant role in murine intestinal colonization by k. pneumoniae.

the fim <dig> locus is not a virulence factor in a murine lung infection model
k. pneumoniae is a clinically important cause of lung infections and various potential virulence factors have been determined  <cit> . the influence of fim <dig> on pneumovirulence was investigated by intranasal inoculation of five mice with a mixture comprising equal numbers of kr <dig> and kr2107∆fim <dig>  an equivalent competition experiment between kr2107∆fim and kr2107∆fim∆fim <dig> was also performed.  <dig> h post-infection all mice displayed significant signs of disease and were sacrificed. high numbers of k. pneumoniae were found in the lungs of all mice . similar lung cfu counts were obtained for both competition assays. furthermore, no significant deviation in fim2-positive to fim2-negative strain ratios was evident for either competition assay . these data suggest that both fim and fim <dig> do not impact significantly on pneumovirulence of k. pneumoniae in a murine lung infection model.

total liver and spleen cfu counts were used as a measure of the ability of bacteria to disseminate from the lungs into the bloodstream. much lower numbers and greater mouse-to-mouse variation occurred in cfu counts for the livers  and spleens  of these mice. the median cfu count per liver for kr <dig>  was elevated compared to that of kr2107∆fim <dig> , although this difference was not significant . when liver cfu counts were examined individually for each mouse, two mice exhibited greater than 1-log more kr <dig> than kr2107∆fim <dig>  while the difference, though still hinting at an advantage for kr <dig>  was less than  <dig>  log for two other mice . the liver cfu counts in mouse  <dig> for both strains were equal to the lower limit of detection and extrapolated from a single colony each, thus preventing meaningful comparison of these values. no difference was found between the median cfu counts per liver for kr2107∆fim and kr2107∆fim∆fim <dig> . thus, despite the absence of firm conclusions emanating from these data, the possibility that fim <dig> may play a role in systemic dissemination and/or survival of k. pneumoniae following murine lung infection cannot be dismissed entirely.

role of fim <dig> in a murine urinary tract infection model
type  <dig> fimbriae are a well-established virulence factor of k. pneumoniae urinary tract infections  <cit> . to assess the role of fim <dig> in k. pneumoniae urinary tract infection, a group of six mice were inoculated transurethrally with a 1: <dig> mixture of kr <dig> and its fim <dig> mutant and sacrificed  <dig> days post-inoculation. all urine and bladder samples were found to be colonized and a median cfu count of  <dig>  ×  <dig> per bladder and  <dig>  ×  <dig> per ml of urine was obtained. in all mice the infection had ascended into the kidneys producing a median bacterial count of  <dig>  ×  <dig> per kidney . the median ci value obtained for bladder samples indicates 10-fold more cfus of kr <dig> than the fim <dig> mutant . these values are supported by the median kidney cfu count which was 10-fold higher for the wildtype  than the fim <dig> mutant , although this difference is not statistically significant  . nevertheless, these concordant findings would suggest that fim <dig> may exert a subtle influence on the urovirulence of k. pneumoniae.

to investigate potential genetic redundancy or functional masking between fim and fim <dig>  the competition assay was repeated in a fim-negative background. consistent with previous data  <cit> , bacterial counts were considerably lower in this fim-negative background experiment as compared to the initial competition assay. infection was established in the bladders of five out of six mice, with a median bacterial count of  <dig>  ×  <dig> in these five mice. at time of sacrifice, infection had ascended into nine of ten kidneys with a median cfu count of  <dig>  ×  <dig> . however, in all cases no bacteria were isolated from the urine suggesting counts of less than  <dig> per ml. the median ci value obtained for bladder samples showed that cfu counts for kr2107∆fim and kr2107∆fim∆fim <dig> did not differ significantly . however, the median kidney cfu counts were  <dig> -fold higher for the kr2107∆fim  than kr2107∆fim∆fim <dig> mutant , and although similar to the results obtained in the fim-positive background these results were also not statistically significant  . these results have confirmed the importance of fim in k. pneumoniae-mediated urovirulence and further support the case for a potential but subtle accessory role for fim <dig> in this disease process.

discussion
the plastic nature of k. pneumoniae genomes is well described and an increasing number of studies have elucidated the function of various components of the accessory genome of the pyogenic liver abscess-associated strain k. pneumoniae ntuh-k <dig>  however, functional characterization of the accessory genome of strains associated with other types of infection is lacking. in order to investigate the plasticity of k. pneumoniae associated with other infections, we previously interrogated the phev locus of sixteen clinical isolates from patients without pyogenic liver abscesses for the presence of foreign dna elements  <cit> . in this study, further trip-pcr interrogation of k. pneumoniae kr <dig> using met56-specific primers identified a novel gi, kpgi- <dig>  inserted within its met <dig> gene. kr <dig> had been isolated from the blood of a patient with pneumonia and neutropenic septicaemia. kpgi- <dig> was sequenced in this study and found to encode a putative γ1-type cu fimbrial operon that has been named fim <dig> 

the genetic organization of fim <dig> resembles that of the k. pneumoniae fim operon and contains homologs of all eight fim genes. fim <dig> is predicted to code for a major fimbrial subunit , three minor fimbrial subunits  and homologs of the fimc and fimd chaperone and usher proteins, respectively, thus classifying this locus as a novel γ1-type cu operon that putatively encodes a fimbrial appendage  <cit> . a seventh predicted protein, fim2i, exhibited 82% identity to fimi, a protein required for fimbrial biogenesis; however, the exact nature of this dependence remains unknown  <cit> . amino acid sequences of the eight fim <dig> gene products showed  <dig> to 92% identity to cognate fim proteins. indeed, the two clusters would appear to be pseudoparalogs, homologs that appear to be paralogous but have ended up in the same genome by both vertical and horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . the unique evolutionary origins of the fim and fim <dig> cluster are further highlighted by differences in transcriptional control. the fim cluster is largely controlled by the fimb and fime recombinases which together switch transcription on and off by inverting a  <dig> bp promoter-containing sequence called fims that lies upstream of fima <cit> . exact copies, genetic remnants or potential functional-replacements of the  <dig> bp fims-flanking inverted repeats could not be identified within the putative fim <dig> promoter region that lies upstream of fim2a. furthermore, as kpgi- <dig> lacks homologs of the fimb and fime recombinases we conclude that fim <dig> expression is not controlled via a fims-like switch mechanism. additionally, the fim2k gene within the fim <dig> cluster encodes an eal domain-containing protein that is similar to fimk, which has previously been shown to regulate type  <dig> fimbrial expression  <cit> . fimk was hypothesised to exert its influence via the hydrolysis of the intracellular messenger c-di-gmp, which is known to regulate expression of virulence genes, motility and biofilm formation in other bacteria  <cit> . the in vitro and in vivo function of fim2k is currently under investigation.

bacterial adhesion to and colonization of host cells is frequently mediated by a diverse assortment of afimbrial and fimbrial adhesins, each thought to possess a particular tissue tropism  <cit> . the vast majority of k. pneumoniae strains are able to produce type  <dig> fimbriae  <cit> . these structures are associated with mannose-sensitive agglutination of guinea pig red blood cells, a phenotype caused by interaction of the adhesin subunit fimh with terminally-exposed mannose residues in n-linked oligosaccharides on cell surfaces  <cit> . previously it has been shown that the fimh residues partaking in binding to mono- and tri-mannose moieties are highly conserved  <cit> . the specific binding properties of fim2h, the putative fim <dig> adhesin, remain to be identified but it is unlikely to bind to mannose since only four out of the  <dig> mono- and tri-mannose binding residues of fimh are strictly conserved in fim2h  <cit> . this is also in agreement with the inability of e. coli hb <dig> expressing fim <dig> to agglutinate guinea pig red blood cells , though the relevance of these data remain uncertain given the lack of visualisable fimbriae in this model.

despite multiple attempts we were unable to visualize fimbrial structures using electron microscopy when the fim <dig> operon was over-expressed in e. coli hb <dig> and k. pneumoniae c3091ΔfimΔmrk. paradoxically, biofilm forming ability appeared to be enhanced in this fim2-expressing e. coli strain. these results are similar to those of a study in which constitutive expression of four of seven e. coli cu fimbrial operons was shown to cause phenotypic alternations despite the fact that fimbrial appendages could not be visualized by electron microscopy  <cit> . difficulty in visualisation of fimbriae by electron microscopy has also been described for the enterotoxigenic e. coli fimbriae cs <dig> and cs <dig> and the putative stg fimbriae of salmonella enterica serovar typhi  <cit> . most interestingly, when the latter was expressed in a bald e. coli strain an enhanced ability to adhere to int- <dig> epithelial cells was noted despite the absence of em-observable fimbriae  <cit> . it is possible that the fim <dig> operon may code for a short and/or thin fimbrial structure that is not readily visualized by electron microscopy, or one that is extremely fragile. conceivably, the hypothesized fim <dig> appendages may be best expressed under biofilm-forming conditions, potentially explaining the enhanced biofilm-forming phenotype exhibited by hb101/pfim2-ptrc, or in other specific in vivo environments. alternatively, the putative phosphodiesterase fim2k may regulate fim <dig> transcription and/or that of an unknown e. coli adherence factor via a c-di-gmp-dependent pathway. indeed, heterologous expression of fim2k has been shown to complement a mutant lacking an eal-bearing protein . proposed future anti-fim2a-based immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy studies in addition to detailed characterisation of fim2k will ultimately help determine the mechanism by which fim <dig> contributes to biofilm formation.

the genomes of e. coli k- <dig>  e. coli o157:h <dig> and salmonella typhi possess numerous cryptic cu fimbrial operons that are tightly regulated and not expressed under the majority of in vitro conditions tested  <cit> . in this work, fim2-specific transcript was identified in standard laboratory culture but the amount detected was 30- to 90-fold lower than that identified for fim and mrk, respectively. compared to the k. pneumoniae genome-averaged a + t content , fim <dig> is at-rich  and the putative promoter region upstream of fim2a possesses an even higher at-content . as moderate-to-marked upregulation of seven cu fimbrial operons has been reported in an e. coli k- <dig> h-ns mutant  <cit> , the finding of an at-rich fim <dig> promoter region suggests that the h-ns protein may play a role in controlling this operon as well. moreover, h-ns has been shown to bind preferentially to regions of horizontally-acquired dna in salmonella typhimurium and it is therefore possible this also occurs with kpgi- <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, in addition to fim2k, kpgi- <dig> also encodes two other potential regulators one or more of which could alter fim <dig> expression. by analogy with other cu systems, we propose that upregulation of fim <dig> expression and biosynthesis of fim <dig> fimbriae is likely to be triggered by specific environmental conditions and involve a complex interplay of multiple transcriptional regulators such as h-ns, fim2k and/or fimk, and levels of expression of other surface components, such as the capsule  <cit> . it is important to note that even though fim <dig> lacks an invertible promoter switch, it may still be stochastically controlled by a bistable regulatory circuit such as the dna methylation-based system described in detail for e. coli pap fimbriae and it is therefore possible that single cell variants expressing fim <dig> may exist  <cit> .

analysis of three sequenced k. pneumoniae strains revealed that, in addition to the fim and mrk operons, these genomes collectively encode at least six other cu fimbrial systems  <cit> , one or more of which may perform an as-yet uncharacterised role in adhesion to target tissues. to investigate the role of fim <dig> in virulence, isogenic fim <dig> mutants were constructed and examined in three murine models, each focussed on primary infection of a distinct clinically-relevant anatomical site. surprisingly, despite many fimbrial systems having been clearly implicated in virulence, we detected no clear evidence of attenuation  or reduction in colonizing ability  in the fim2-negative strains studied.

intriguingly, examination of bladder cfu count-based cis for the urinary tract infection experiments hinted at a subtle role for fim <dig> in the colonization of bladder and kidney tissues. in both tissues, median wildtype cfu counts were approximately ten-fold higher than those of the fim <dig> mutant, although when performed in a fim negative background this difference was reversed and reduced in bladder and kidney samples, respectively. nevertheless, the latter conflicting results may due to the markedly lower cfu counts obtained in the fim negative background. as shown by neutral ci values in the lung tissue but an approximately 100-fold higher median liver cfu count for kr <dig> as compared to its isogenic fim <dig> mutant, the fim <dig> locus would appear to be involved in systemic dissemination and/or survival of k. pneumoniae following primary infection of the respiratory tract. however, given the noted lack of statistical significance, low numbers of mice examined and substantial mouse-to-mouse variation for these liver cfu data, no firm conclusions can be derived at present. as an aside, the previously demonstrated dramatic positive contribution of fim to urovirulence in this murine model was also shown to be the case in the kr <dig> background  <cit> . at an overview level, based on total cfu counts per liver and per kidney for the lung infection and ascending urinary tract infection models, respectively, there was a suggestion, though not supported statistically, of an ordered gradation amongst the four isogenic strains with the most-to-least virulent as follows: kr <dig>  kr2107∆fim <dig>  kr2107∆fim and kr2107∆fim∆fim <dig>  we speculate this relates to a fim2-mediated enhancement of bacterial biofilm-forming-, adhesive- and/or invasive-potential under the in vivo conditions tested. in addition, the predicted influence of fim2k on the c-di-gmp regulatory circuit, may itself impact on virulence via regulation of fim <dig>  fim and/or other virulence factors.

the fim <dig> cluster was also assessed for its ability to contribute to biofilm formation. gene knock-out experiments in kr <dig> failed to reveal a role for fim <dig> in biofilm formation. however, the function of the product of fim <dig> may have been masked due to physical interference by the k. pneumoniae capsule, a phenomenon previously observed with type  <dig> fimbriae  <cit> . alternatively, it may be a function of limited fim <dig> expression under the in vitro conditions examined. therefore, heterologous expression of fim <dig> in the afimbriate e. coli strain hb <dig> and the bald fim2-negative k. pneumoniae c3091∆fim∆mrk mutant was pursued. yet again evidence of a fim2-associated phenotype was elusive and only apparent in hb <dig> and then too only when crystal violet-staining data were standardised for total pre-wash cell numbers. attempts to alleviate the observed growth retardation associated with over-expression of fim <dig> in a hb <dig> background by reducing incubation temperature to 30°c and by providing rare trnas in trans were unsuccessful. furthermore, the observed growth retardation was highly reproducible even when newly generated hb <dig> strains possessing independently-constructed pfim2-ptrc plasmids were used instead . thus, it would appear that over-expression of fim <dig> in hb <dig> was specifically responsible for this phenotype, though no comparable effect occurred with over-expression of fim.

the presence of fim <dig> in more than one species and its global spread suggests that this horizontally acquired locus has been maintained within a subset of the klebsiella population due to positive selection. hence, although the role fim <dig> remains elusive, given the glimpses of functionality hinted at by our data and the evolutionary survival of this multi-gene entity, we hypothesize that putative fim <dig> contributes to pathogenesis of infection and/or environmental persistence, at least under highly specific conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have described the kpgi- <dig> island which possessed a novel γ1-type cu operon called fim <dig>  although fim <dig> was shown to be expressed at an mrna level and its function was investigated using three distinct murine infection models, tissue culture experiments and biofilm assays, no obvious in vitro or in vivo role for the fim <dig> locus was identified, although there were subtle hints of involvement in urovirulence and in bacterial dissemination from the respiratory tract. nevertheless, as fim <dig> was found in approximately 13% of klebsiella spp. isolates examined, we propose that fim <dig> has the potential to contribute beneficially to its host klebsiella strains at least under specific conditions.
