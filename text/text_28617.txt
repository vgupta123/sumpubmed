BACKGROUND
in barley, it is estimated that plant lodging can cause a reduction of up to 65% in grain yield  <cit> . weakness in the stem and poor root anchorage, when subjected to external factors such as wind, rain or disease, result in stem/root lodging or the permanent failure of the plant shoot to support its upright position  <cit> . stem strength is a complex trait reflecting cellulose content, the length, number and arrangement of vascular bundle fibres in the organ, the orientation of cellulose microfibrils and the degree of lignification  <cit> . these traits contribute synergistically to plant stem strength. previous studies have shown that a decrease in load-bearing cell wall polymers such as cellulose or lignin can negatively affect stem strength in barley  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . in wheat, a combination of fourier transform infrared resonance  analysis, histology and principle component analysis , showed that cellulose contributed more to stem strength than lignin  <cit> . similarly in maize, appenzeller et al.  <cit>  and ching et al.  <cit>  showed a strong correlation  between cellulose content  and internodal flexural stem strength, but found no consistent correlation between lignin content and stem strength.

cellulose content therefore seems to be an important contributing factor in stem strength of cereal species. at the molecular level, cellulose consists of linear, unbranched chains of glucosyl residues linked by -β-glucosidic linkages  <cit> . cellulose chains are often described as flat ribbons that aggregate into microfibrils of  <dig> to  <dig>  nm in thickness. there is some debate as to the precise number of chains that constitute a microfibril, with values ranging from  <dig> individual -β-glucan chains  <cit>  to as few as  <dig> chains  <cit> . the microfibrils can further aggregate to form larger macrofibrils and can serve as a scaffold for the non-covalent cross-linking of other non-cellulosic polysaccharides. in primary cell walls, cellulose microfibrils are generally arranged perpendicular to the axis of cell elongation, although the alignment between microfibrils is not strictly parallel. such an arrangement of microfibrils provides both strength and flexibility that enable the primary cell walls to withstand turgor pressure and to assist in the cell’s directional growth. in the secondary wall, the microfibrils are more organised and are often aligned in parallel arrays. there can be several layers in secondary walls and within each layer the parallel microfibrils can be oriented at different angles to create laminated layers that further strengthen the wall and restrict the cell’s lateral or radial growth.

data from transcript analyses in barley are consistent with arabidopsis mutational studies, insofar as the abundance of cesa transcripts in various tissues at different stages of cell wall development, together with co-expression analyses, suggest that two groups of three cesa genes are co-ordinately expressed during the growth of the primary cell wall  and the secondary cell wall . in barley, hvcesa <dig>  hvcesa <dig> and hvcesa <dig> are believed to be involved in cellulose synthesis during primary cell wall deposition, while hvcesa <dig>  hvcesa <dig> and hvcesa <dig> are postulated to participate in cellulose synthesis during scw deposition; a total of eight hvcesa genes have been identified  <cit> . it should be noted that these conclusions are based on co-expression of the two groups of three genes and their relatively high transcript levels in tissues that are believed to be undergoing predominantly pcw or scw deposition. there is no direct evidence in barley that the groups of three enzymes encoded by the three hvcesa genes form a multi-enzyme complex, although this seems likely based on data from other systems  <cit> .

in the work described here, barley has been transformed with hvcesa genes driven by the powerful constitutive camv 35s promoter, with a view to increasing cellulose content in the walls of transgenic lines and to evaluating the effects of increased cellulose on stem strength. all three pcw hvcesa and two scw hvcesa genes were studied. the hvcesa5/ <dig> genes were omitted because they appeared to encode enzymes with identical amino acid sequences. the results provide information on the potential for altering cell wall composition in important crop species of the triticeae from which residual straw, bran from flour milling and spent grain from the brewery might be used in renewable biofuel production.

RESULTS
hvcesa genes are distributed across the grass genome
at least eight barley  hvcesa genes were identified by burton and co-authors  <cit> . with the recent release of the barley scaffold  <cit> , a total of nine barley hvcesas genes has now been identified. in silico mapping of hvcesa genes in barley and two other economically important grasses, sorghum bicolor  and oryza sativa  indicated that the cesa genes are broadly distributed across the genomes, especially so in barley where hvcesa genes are found on every chromosome except chromosome  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows homologous relationships of the cesa genes in barley, sorghum and rice.figure  <dig>

only plants containing scw 35s:hvcesa constructs exhibit aberrant phenotypes
a total of five constructs driven by the camv 35s constitutive promoter were individually transformed into barley. these included the three pcw cellulose synthase cdnas hvcesa <dig>  hvcesa <dig> and hvcesa <dig>  and the two scw cellulose synthase cdnas hvcesa <dig> and hvcesa <dig>  between  <dig> and  <dig> transgenic plants per construct were generated.

most plants  transformed with pcw hvcesa cdnas showed no visual abnormalities compared with control golden promise barley plants grown under the same conditions. in contrast, more dramatic phenotypes were observed in transgenic plants carrying the scw hvcesa cdnas. dwarfism and early-stage leaf necrosis observed in t035s:hvcesa <dig> plants persisted into the t <dig>  and t <dig> generations . at about one month old, these plants were stunted and necrosis was noticeable at leaf tips . dwarf plants took a month longer to reach maturity compared with controls. in the t <dig> generation, about 25% of transgenic progeny from t <dig> dwarf parents either died or were sterile , suggesting that this severe phenotype might be linked to a homozygous state for the 35s:hvcesa <dig> gene. this could not be directly tested but surviving plants showed evidence of segregation; these plants yielded few viable grains.figure  <dig>

35s:hvcesa <dig> plants and wild-type  golden promise on the far left. dwarfism  persisted in most plants grown from parents with an aberrant phenotype except for one or two plants within the same line . the ratio of plants displaying dwarf: normal phenotype  in t <dig> is 58%: 42%.  many t <dig>  35s:hvcesa <dig> progeny were dwarfed with “brittle nodes” . about 25% of t <dig> plants from each line exhibited a severe reduction in stature, was sterile  and some died. the plants with a severe phenotype may be homozygotes.  close up view of necrosis found at the leaf-tips of a 1 month old plant that further developed into a dwarf plant with few viable grains.  t1

for the 35s:hvcesa <dig> t <dig> and t <dig> generations, most plants showed no obvious difference in height, although the putative homozygotes did not grow past the tillering stage   <cit>  and subsequently died . this is similar to the putative homozygotes found in t235s:hvcesa <dig> plants that were stunted and died at an early stage.

another feature observed in the t <dig> and t <dig> generations of both the 35s:hvcesa <dig> and 35s:hvcesa <dig> transgenic plants was brittleness at stem nodes at the heading stage . this phenotype was apparent for 35s:hvcesa <dig> in every generation but only became obvious in later generations of 35s:hvcesa <dig>  especially in the t <dig> generation. the break-point of the brittle node phenotype was usually close to the nodal plate but not found within the stem internode as indicated by a horizontal arrow in figure 2f. there was also a 45%  reduction in the average stem diameter of dwarf t135s:hvcesa <dig> tillers, although no significant difference in the diameter of brittle node t135s:hvcesa <dig> stems compared with the controls was observed.

transcript profiles of t <dig> plants carrying pcw and scw 35s:hvcesa constructs
the t <dig> generation of transgenic plants were profiled to determine the effect of pcw and scw hvcesa manipulations. transcript profiles were generated for sets of transgenic plants carrying the three pcw hvcesa cdnas, namely 35s:hvcesa <dig>  35s:hvcesa <dig> and 35s:hvcesa <dig> and for the two scw 35s:hvcesa <dig> and 35s:hvcesa <dig> cdnas. for each set of hvcesa transgenic plants, transcript levels for the corresponding endogenous genes were also examined . primers for these endogenous genes are selective and do not amplify the transgene transcript.

transcript levels for all pcw hvcesa transgenes were low with less than 10% of the levels of transcripts for the corresponding ehvcesa genes expressed in control plants . although varying levels of transcript were observed for ehvcesa <dig>  ehvcesa <dig> and ehvcesa <dig> genes in the three transgenic plant sets, the transcript levels for the endogenous genes were generally lower or equal to those measured in control plants . this indicated that both the transgene and endogenous pcw hvcesa gene transcript levels were often suppressed in the transgenic lines.

similarly, the transgene and its endogenous counterpart were profiled in the scw hvcesa t <dig> generation and suppression of endogenous scw genes was also observed for both constructs . unlike pcw transgenic sets, a higher up-regulation of scw cesa transgene levels was observed and measured to be more than 10% of the endogenous levels in control plants. the hvcesa <dig> transgene achieved the highest level of up-regulation, measuring 60% of transgene/endogenous ratio .

transcript profiles in t <dig> plants containing scw 35s:hvcesa constructs
only subsequent generations of plants carrying scw constructs were studied, because they exhibited less transgene suppression and hence more likely to have an increased cellulose content. in addition, the observation of drastically distinct phenotypes between the scw transgenic plants allowed comparisons between the 35s:hvcesa <dig> and 35s:hvcesa <dig> constructs.

transcript profiles for both scw transgenic plants showed plants with either aberrant or normal phenotypes, with each phenotype described represented by three independent segregating lines . a striking similarity was observed between plants of t135s:hvcesa <dig> and t135s:hvcesa <dig>  where suppression of endogenous transcript was accompanied by dwarfism. in line with a more severe gene suppression in t135s:hvcesa <dig> lines, these plants died early but those in t135s:hvcesa <dig> survived to maturity. dwarfed plants had a lower level of endogenous transcript relative to control and normal-looking plants. normal plants in t135s:hvcesa <dig> showed a two-fold transgene up-regulation and maintained endogenous transcript levels similar to those in control plants . however, normal plants in t135s:hvcesa <dig> had lower endogenous transcript levels relative to control plants, probably to compensate for the five-fold increase of transgene. detailed transcript profiles for the transgene and the endogenous ehvcesa <dig>  ehvcesa <dig> and ehvcesa <dig> genes for t <dig> scw plants relative to control plants are shown in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

another observation in t135s:hvcesa <dig> was that, regardless of the phenotypes observed, tight co-regulation between the three endogenous genes was maintained across the whole transgenic set , indicating that the dwarf phenotype did not perturb the coordination of gene transcription of the three scw hvcesa genes.

in terms of the “tight” co-regulation between the three endogenous hvcesa genes, there was a perturbation between ehvcesa4-ehvcesa <dig>  and ehvcesa7-ehvcesa <dig>  for plants with a ‘brittle node’ phenotype. co-regulation of ehvcesa4-ehvcesa <dig> in the same plants remained tight . for all other plants with either stunted or normal phenotypes, the determination coefficient, r <dig>  was in the range  <dig>  to  <dig> . this was quite different to the dwarfed scw cesa transgenic lines and suggested that the brittle node phenotype may be a direct or indirect result of the perturbed co-regulation between ehvcesa <dig> and other ehvcesa genes. furthermore, transcript profiles between normal and brittle node plants in t135s:hvcesa <dig> do not differ, which suggests that the aberrant phenotype is not associated with transcript abundance.

crystalline cellulose content and stem strength
for t135s:hvcesa <dig> plants, there was no significant increase in cellulose content, as measured chemically, whether expressed as % cellulose per total cell wall  or as mg cellulose per cm stem . normal-looking plants showed a flexural strength similar to the controls plants and most plants with dwarfism displayed a significant reduction in cellulose content and stem strength . on average, cellulose per total cell wall decreased by 40% and the stem strength was also reduced to 20% of the average of control plants.figure  <dig>

plants.  cellulose content was measured as percent cellulose . there were three independent lines with a dwarfed and leaf necrosis phenotype  and three lines with a normal phenotype.  maximum flexural load, n, was a measure of stem strength. there were three independent lines with ‘brittle node’ phenotype  and three normal-looking transgenic plants. plants that were severely stunted died at a young stage so were not available for cellulose content analysis. error bars are standard error of the mean of biological replicates . significant differences were determined by one-way anova followed by post hoc dunnett’s multiple comparisons test.



similarly, no significant increase in cellulose content for the 35s:hvcesa <dig> t <dig> plants was observed , even where high levels of transgene transcript were detected, and there was no significant increase in plant stem strength. a 46-53% decrease in stem strength relative to controls was found in line  <dig> and line  <dig>  which are likely due to reason unrelated to cellulose content.

t <dig> plants transformed with constructs pcw or scw were also analysed and showed that there was no significant increase in either crystalline cellulose content or stem strength .

observation of crystalline cellulose using immunofluorescent- labelling in stem tissues of t <dig> plants
to examine potential changes in cellulose distribution as related to the chemically quantitated reduction shown in figure  <dig>  immunofluorescent labelling with the cbm3a protein was conducted, for both internode and node sections of dwarf t235s:hvcesa <dig> plants and brittle node t235s:hvcesa <dig> plants .figure  <dig>

fluorescence intensity of labelling on both node and internode sections of t235s:hvcesa <dig> was reduced for all cell types  compared with control sections . in the case of the t235s:hvcesa <dig> plants , all cell types were labelled at a similar intensity to the control . similar reductions in intensity were detected in the node sections for t235s:hvcesa <dig> plants .

although the immunocytochemical images will normally give a semi-quantitative estimation of crystalline cellulose, the less intense fluorescence detected in the internode and node sections of t <dig> lines carrying the 35s:hvcesa <dig> construct was consistent with the reduced amounts of crystalline cellulose measured chemically .

staining with toluidine blue showed that xylem vessels in internode cross-sections of dwarfed 35s:hvcesa <dig> t <dig> plants were partially collapsed and had irregular boundaries along the elliptical xylem vessels . collapsed xylem vessels were also observed in leaves from dwarf plants  but were not seen in 35s:hvcesa <dig> t <dig> brittle node plants or in control plants, where xylem vessels were round in shape . for severely stunted 35s:hvcesa <dig> t <dig> plants, samples were collected and fixed shortly before the plant died. these plants appeared to comprise only the leaves arising from the crown of the base at the plant . secondary xylem  did not develop, perhaps because the tissue was too young, but normal proto-xylem development was observed.figure  <dig>

cell walls for collapsed xylem from t235s:hvcesa <dig> were examined for reductions in cell wall thickness, as were the sclerenchyma cells . consistent with the more severe morphology observed in 35s:hvcesa <dig> dwarf plants , their xylem cell walls were thinner overall, had irregular edges and were occasionally interrupted by apparent gaps in the middle lamella layer. in some cases, two walls detached at the middle lamella . this was not seen in control plants. the scw of sclerenchyma cells located under the epidermis of the stem also showed a reduced thickness for both t235s:hvcesa <dig> plants . cell walls in t235s:hvcesa <dig> appeared collapsed and cell wall thickenings were located mainly at cell corners.figure  <dig>

measurements for xylem cell wall thickness were taken from ten images of xylem vessels imaged from two independent lines and a 45% reduction in xylem cell wall thickness was found in plants carrying 35s:hvcesa <dig> . this decrease in cell wall thickness was further supported by a decrease in percentage of total cell wall material  extracted from stem tissues, although we acknowledge that the yield of air material will be only semi-quantitative in nature. it was found that dwarf 35s:hvcesa <dig> and brittle node 35s:hvcesa <dig> plants had 44% and 10% reductions in total air extracted, respectively .

aohara et al.  <cit>  attributed a rice “brittle node” phenotype to a drastic reduction of lignified tissues in the node. nodes from three different t235s:hvcesa <dig> and 35s:hvcesa <dig> plants exhibiting the ‘brittle node’ phenotype were therefore sectioned and stained with phloroglucinol-hcl but no significant changes in lignin content were observed .

discussion
to investigate whether stem strength in barley and hence resistance to lodging might be improved through increasing cellulose levels in cell walls, barley was transformed with individual pcw  and scw  cellulose synthase cdnas from barley , driven by the constitutive camv 35s promoter. we have used the camv 35s promoter successfully to over-express transgenes in barley and other groups have used this promoter to successfully over-express transgenes in rice  <cit> , although we acknowledge that alternative promoters such as maize ubiquitin  <cit>  and rice actin  <cit>  have been shown to be generally more active in monocots.

visual phenotypes
the hvcesa transgenic plants were examined for a visual phenotype, transcript levels of both transgenes and endogenous genes, stem strength, stem morphology, cell wall ultrastructure, cellulose content and crystalline cellulose distribution in the cell wall. more than 90% of t <dig> transgenic plants carrying pcw 35s:hvcesa constructs exhibited no drastic phenotypic defects but aberrant phenotypes were observed in approximately 25% of the scw 35:hvcesa plants and these phenotypes persisted into the t <dig> and t <dig> generations . from the transcript analyses of t <dig> pcw 35s:hvcesa plants, transgene expression levels for all individuals were very low and in some transgenic populations, the endogenous genes were co-suppressed . for scw 35s:hvcesa plants, transgene transcript levels higher than the endogenous transcripts in control plant were found  but this did not result in any significant increase in cellulose content above control levels . indeed, we were unable to increase the total cellulose content in any of the transgenic lines and in some lines it decreased significantly .

reductions in crystalline cellulose
the present work showed that the crystalline cellulose content of 35s:hvcesa <dig> dwarf plants, as determined by the updegraff  <cit>  method, was lower than control plants . the reduction in crystalline cellulose was confirmed in both nodes and internodal regions of the stem by immunofluorescence . a reduction in crystalline cellulose may not be the sole contributor to the defect in xylem integrity; a reduction in lignin might also be a contributing factor. phloroglucinol-hcl staining of xylem cells indicated that although lignin was present, no large differences could be detected between the control and transgenic plants. to quantitate more subtle reductions in lignin content, klasson lignin assays  <cit>  could be used, but these assays were not applied in the present study.

common perturbations in cell morphology
in dwarfed scw 35s:hvcesa <dig> barley lines, cell morphology was perturbed and xylem vessels had both collapsed and showed a reduction in cell wall thickness . a similar phenotype has been described in arabidopsis irx mutants  <cit> . when joshi and collaborators  <cit>  introduced another copy of the scw populus tremuloides l cellulose synthase ptdcesa <dig> gene, which is the putative orthologue of barley hvcesa <dig>  driven by the camv 35s promoter into transgenic poplar plants, severe silencing of both the endogenous and transgene cesas, together with a dramatically reduced cellulose content, dwarfism and a collapsed xylem phenotype, were observed. however, joshi et al.  <cit>  did not report a reduction in wall thickness. in contrast, reductions in cell wall thickness were detected here in t235s:hvcesa <dig> plants that exhibited a dwarf phenotype, where the reduction in xylem cell wall thickness was accompanied by an apparent reduction in total extractable cell wall material .

the striking resemblance between phenotypes  for the 35s:hvcesa <dig> construct in barley and the cellulose deficient 35s:cesa transgenic poplar further strengthen the suggestion that, despite the wide phylogenetic distance between a woody tree and a grass, the regulation of scw cesas may be conserved. however, it is still unclear if the phenotypic changes observed in the barley transgenic lines are directly attributable to silencing the corresponding scw hvcesa <dig> gene or to pleiotropic effects, because mutations other than those in cesa genes invoke similar morphological defects. examples are mutations in genes involved in lignin biosynthesis  <cit> , xylan biosynthesis  <cit> , a mutated endoglucanase  <cit>  and pectin biosynthesis via over-expression of qua <dig>  <cit> , which all resulted in collapsed xylem vessels.

tight regulation and different effects are observed for individual hvcesa genes
our results demonstrated that perturbing hvcesa gene expression in the some transgenic lines not only caused extreme phenotypes but also resulted in the silencing of endogenous hvcesa genes and, in many cases, in reduced crystalline cellulose contents. it appears likely therefore that barley, and probably other plants, have evolved tight regulatory mechanisms to maintain cellulose levels within a relatively narrow range. studies in transgenic petunia and other plants indicate that sense co-suppression can be related to promoter strength  <cit> . however, in the present study, some transgenic lines showed similar or higher endogenous hvcesa transcript levels compared with the control plants, but displayed the same phenotypic features as the lines in which transcript levels were lower.

the 35s:hvcesa <dig> construct caused more severe developmental defects than the 35s:hvcesa <dig> construct. the t <dig> transgenic plants of both constructs were brittle at the nodes but 35s:hvcesa <dig> plants were also dwarfed and had collapsed xylem vessels. the differences in the severity of the transgenic phenotypes between 35s:hvcesa <dig> and 35s:hvcesa <dig> suggest that the protein products of these two secondary cell wall hvcesa genes have different or unequal roles in cellulose synthesis. it has been shown that in the fs <dig> brittle stem mutant of barley, in which transcription of the hvcesa <dig> gene is compromised by the presence of a retrotransposon in the first intron of the gene, cellulose crystallinity is reduced  <cit> . however, the tight co-regulation between the two groups of three endogenous hvcesa genes was not perturbed in the fs <dig> brittle stem mutant of barley. in contrast, the tight co-expression of these genes was not always retained in transgenic lines generated in the present study, in which plants with a ‘brittle node’ phenotype showed much reduced co-efficients of determination between ehvcesa4-ehvcesa <dig> and ehvcesa7-ehvcesa <dig>  co-regulation of ehvcesa4-ehvcesa <dig> in the same plants remained tight . for all other plants with either stunted or normal phenotypes, r <dig> was in the range  <dig>  to  <dig> . in contrast to the situation in the fs <dig> brittle stem mutant  <cit> , the ‘brittle node’ phenotype observed here may be a direct or indirect result of a breakdown of the co-regulation of the ehvcesa <dig> gene and genes encoding its putative partners in the cellulose synthase complex.

there is some evidence of redundancy and dual functionality in the roles of cesa proteins in arabidopsis, where the pcw atcesa <dig> and atcesa <dig> proteins are partially redundant to atcesa <dig>  one of the three cesa protein subunits in the pcw cellulose synthase complex  <cit> . moreover, the arabidopsis scw atcesa <dig>  which is the putative orthologue of the barley scw hvcesa <dig>  was found to partially rescue defects in the pcw mutant cesa <dig> and, conversely, pcw atcesa <dig> was able to partly rescue defects in the scw mutant cesa8ko  <cit> . this suggests that there is flexibility between cesa protein function depending on the tissue or environmental conditions  <cit> . it might also be argued that the constitutive expression of the 35s promoter leads to a negative dominant phenotype by disturbing the endogenous gene expression in the secondary wall forming cells. mis-assembly of the functional enzyme complex may ensue because of disturbed stoichiometry of the various subunits. the transcript profiles from this study also showed that stoichiometry is maintained, pointing to the existence of a homeostatic mechanism. the hvcesa <dig> gene showed strong overexpression in most lines and was associated with the downregulation of endogenous genes in lines with dwarf phenotypes. the brittle phenotype was correlated with high transgene expression in the absence of strongly reduced transcript levels of endogenous cesa genes. this suggests that the perturbation of the stoichiometry of individual cesa proteins in the cellulose synthase complex  may be responsible for the brittle phenotype.

brittle stems arise by different genetic lesions
in the fs <dig> barley mutant, a brittle stem phenotype arose due to the insertion of a retroelement in the first intron of the hvcesa <dig> gene. this fs <dig> mutant had reduced crystalline cellulose and increased non-crystalline cellulose compared to control plants  <cit> . this showed that hvcesa <dig> is essential for the integrity of the cell wall that would otherwise lead to brittleness of the stem. in the present study, brittleness caused by scw 35s:hvcesa <dig> was restricted to the node region of the plant stem, unlike the brittleness found in the fs <dig> mutant  <cit> . the less severe phenotype may arise due to the presence of low level of functional cesa <dig> protein in the silenced transgenic lines described here, whereas in the fs <dig> mutant, there may have been no functional cesa <dig> protein present. as to why the phenotype was restricted to the nodal region, perhaps these joints are the weakest point of the stem and any cell wall defects would be more obvious in this area.

the “brittle node” phenotype exhibited by both 35s:hvcesa <dig> and 35s:hvcesa <dig> plants also resembled the phenotype previously described in the rice bc <dig> brittle culm mutant  <cit> . the exact gene affected by this mutation was not identified but scw oscesa transcripts were suppressed and it was found that walls of sclerenchyma cells in the leaf sheath bundle around the stem node were thinner  <cit> . although suppression of all scw ehvcesa genes was also found in the “brittle node” plants in the present study, gene suppression alone cannot explain the “brittle node” phenotype observed in barley because other transgenic plants with a normal phenotype displayed similar suppression of transcripts. the “brittle node” phenotype may be caused by the disrupted coordination between hvcesa <dig> and hvcesa <dig> proteins as a result of altered transcript levels, although other factors such as the formation of the rosette complex, cellulose assembly and interactions with other players in cell wall assembly are also likely to affect the final phenotype of a plant.

our inability to increase cellulose content in the transgenic barley lines may also be attributable to a requirement for all three hvcesa genes in a complex to be over-expressed simultaneously. thus, concurrent up-regulation may be needed to produce a successful increase in cellulose. although attempts to simultaneously up-regulate the three co-ordinately expressed pcw and scw hvcesa genes were not within the scope of this paper, such a goal using the current lines is possible in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the results presented here indicate that potential challenges could be encountered in attempts to engineer cellulose levels in planta by manipulating either pcw or scw hvcesa genes using the camv 35s promoter. however, the observed pleiotropic phenotypes and transcript silencing arising from our systematic introduction of individual hvcesa genes into transgenic barley provided us with an opportunity to deduce the roles of individual hvcesa genes. our results demonstrated unequal roles within scw genes and between pcw and scw genes to maintain the structural integrity of cell walls and on the overall ability of the plants to stay upright. the hvcesa <dig> gene showed the most negative effects on plant growth in barley. similar developmental defects observed by joshi and colleagues  <cit>  for a tree species indicate tight regulation of cellulose biosynthetic genes occurs across the plant kingdom and further work is needed to unravel the complexity of this process.
