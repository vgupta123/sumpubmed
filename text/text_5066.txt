BACKGROUND
crab-eating macaques  are one of the most frequently used and studied species for biomedical research  <cit> . due to the broad range of habitats, they have various common names including crab-eating macaque, cynomolgus macaque, philippine monkey, and long-tailed macaque. numerous wild crab-eating macaques are distributed in southeast asia, including indonesia, philippines, myanmar, vietnam, and thailand  <cit> . they inhabit various habitats including primary, secondary, coastal, mangrove, and riverine forests and areas near villages. diurnal and arboreal crab-eating macaques belong to the infraorder catarrhini, superfamily carecopithecoidea, family cercopithecidae, and genus macaca.

with the aid of fossil records and comparative dna sequence analysis, genus macaques and humans have diverged from a common ancestor between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this evolutionary relationship has made this primate as a more suitable experimental animal model than rodents, dogs, and pigs and may lead to its widespread use for the translational studies for drug testing  <cit> . among the genus macaca, rhesus and crab-eating macaque is representative species which were widely used as a non-human primate model for biomedical research. however, the rhesus macaque is the most frequently used primate as a non-human primate model  <cit> . in the united states, more than 60% of monkeys housed in national institutes of health -supported facilities are rhesus macaques  <cit> . furthermore, 65% of the monkeys used for experimental research each year are rhesus macaques. in  <dig>  first draft genome sequences of rhesus macaque genome was published  <cit> . these worldwide trends in use and accumulated genome information data may lead to the assumption that the rhesus macaque is the ideal non-human primate model. however, the event of “export ban of rhesus monkey from india in 1977” had restricted the usage of indian subspecies of the rhesus macaque and accelerate the building of self-sustaining breeding colonies in the us. therefore, researchers who want to have a research with rhesus monkey in the outside of us have some problems, they have concerned the chinese-origin rhesus macaque and crab-eating macaque from south asia  <cit> . furthermore, the crab-eating macaque has important advantages, including  easy handling derived from a smaller body size , weight  and longer tails than rhesus macaques  <cit> ;  low cost and easy availability for experimental use; and  lack of seasonal fertility, which may affect efficient experiments and scheduling in the large-scale housing of experimental monkeys  <cit> . finally, abundant gene information is available for the crab-eating macaque. greater numbers of est and full-length cdna library sequences are available in the ncbi database for crab-eating macaque  <cit> . and recently their draft genome sequences also available in the ebi database  <cit> . therefore, crab-eating macaque could be a excellent experimental primate animal models for biomedical studies.

in an in-depth examination of the published papers from  <dig> to  <dig> indicated that pharmacology field for safety and toxicity testing of newly developed drugs was the most frequently encountered  <cit> . in particular, the crab-eating macaque was used predominantly in brain research, the neurosciences, and clinical research  <cit> . furthermore, experimental primate model have been developed by four different ways of simple replacement, induced, infection, and surgical. the induced method involved treatment with specific chemicals  or streptozotocin  <cit> , whereas the surgical method  were created through specific types of surgery  <cit> . the infection method was simpler than previously described since humans and the crab-eating macaque have numerous “anthroponosis” , including influenza, tuberculosis, and hepatitis  <cit> . lastly, simple replacement method was the usage of natural crab-eating monkey for specific purpose   <cit> .

from now, numerous disease models, including aging, alcohol abuse, alzheimer’s disease, amenorrhea, asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, menopause, obesity, osteoporosis, parkinson’s disease, plague, variola, vascular disease, and various infection disease models, have been developed and used  <cit>  however, small amount of transcript sequences of crab-eating macaque could be a weak point to be a good experimental animals for biomedical application. if we have abundant transcript sequences for crab-eating macaque, we could design the whole gene probe sequences for microarray analyses. and also, due to the insufficient transcript sequences, we could not analyze the alternatively spliced transcripts in different tissues. recent accumulated transcriptome information underlined that as event is an important molecular mechanism since it can generate different functional units for transcriptome and proteome diversity using limited genetic sources <cit> . and also human transcriptome studies with different human tissues show different as patterns derived by tissue-specific alternative promoters and polyadenylation  <cit> . however, sometimes aberrant changes in alternative splicing could occur the human disease   <cit> . and a few number of papers have reviewed the association between alternative splicing and disease  <cit> . among the different as mechanism, te exonization is intriguing as events  <cit> . specifically, small amount of tes show the tissue specific and species specific characters  <cit> . that means that te exonization event could be a one of the important as events. therefore, as is not a simple molecular aspect of rna transcription, rather it represents a highly controlled and evolved molecular mechanism for generating genetic diversity using limited dna resources. and also as control mechanism are major growing topics in biomedical researches. hence, the investigation of the as events in specific genes is another means of novel gene or disease gene identification and characterization steps. however, these kinds of applications with crab-eating macaque for advanced biomedical research could be achieved by the massive amount of transcript sequences and information.

in this study, we carried out a whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis of  <dig> tissues from macaca fascicularis using gs flx sequencing to generate massive transcript information for the improvement of biomedical use. more than  <dig> million raw reads were created and assembled, resulting in  <dig>  isogroups,  <dig>  isotigs,  <dig>  contigs, and  <dig>  singletons. additionally, we identified and experimentally validated differentially expressed gene  transcripts. finally, using the numerous transcript sequences, we analyze the as and te events of crab-eating macaque.

RESULTS
gs flx sequencing and gene annotation
among the different next generation sequencing methods, we selected the gs flx sequencing platform. although this platform demanded the high cost for sequencing, longer read length of output sequences are more adequate for the de novo assembly for crab-eating macaque genes  <cit> . a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained from the  <dig> different tissue libraries, with a mean sequenced size length of 355 bp . for rapid assembly and exact gene annotation, all raw reads were divided into  <dig> groups, clustered reads and unclustered reads, by the clustering method of the blastn program with human reference rna, generating  <dig> , <dig> reads clustered with human reference rna, and  <dig>  unclustered reads . each group was analyzed by gs de novo assembler v. <dig> . <dig> . in the clustered group,  <dig>  assembled contigs,  <dig>  isotigs, and  <dig>  isogroups and  <dig>  unassembled singletons were generated. however,  <dig>  reads were discarded due to excessively short, chimeric, or repetitive sequences. for the clustered isotigs, half of the sequences were larger than 900 bp, and more than  <dig>  were longer than  <dig>  bp . total annotated sequences covered ~86%  of the human reference genes . by contrast, 55% of the sequences  did not match any of the human reference genes . although more detailed experimental validations must be performed, these sequences  may be macaque-specific genes that define differences between humans and crab-eating macaques.

application for omim database and kegg pathway database
we then applied our results to the omim database , which provides information on disorder-related genes that have been functionally well-characterized, and the kegg pathway database , a representative molecular pathway database specifically for disease-related pathways. in the omim database, we collected all of the available gene sets for calculation of coverage. of the  <dig>  disorder-related genes in the omim database ,  <dig>  genes  were covered by our results , indicating that the gene information from our sequencing could lead to an enhanced understanding of the genetic responses to specific experimental conditions in disease-related research on the crab-eating macaque.

mptp treatment of the crab-eating macaque is one of the most well established models of parkinson’s disease  <cit> . therefore, we applied our results to the investigation of parkinson’s disease  in the kegg pathway. in general, first step of disease mechanism research is the identification of full-length gene sequences, specifically coding sequences , using cdna library or race experiments for the investigation of a specific disease. then other following steps of in vitro or in vivo experiments are applied for the characterization of specific disease. therefore, the identification of intact cds in genes was our primary goal. in the kegg pathway database,  <dig> parkinson’s disease genes were registered. we manually tested the existence of open-reading frame sequences and compared the existence of full-length cds with our sequencing data . our results indicated that total  <dig> genes  harbor the intact full-length cds  or truncated cds or utr sequences . these high rate of identification of intact full-length sequences are coincided the property of gs flx sequencing platform   <cit> . although, we did not validated the other disease-related genes in omim database, our results can clearly reduce the cost and experimental efforts for the identification of specific disorder-related genes for biomedical research.

differentially expressed gene analysis and experimental validation
more than  <dig> million reads harboring tissue information were used in the assembly steps . therefore, it was possible to use tissue information to identify differentially expressed genes  candidates. strict filtering conditions were applied for the identification of deg candidates . in total,  <dig> genes were identified as deg candidates . testis  and liver  showed the largest number of deg candidates . by contrast, the ovary, spleen, cerebrum, and cerebellum did not harbor tissue-specific transcripts. however, when we pooled the cerebrum and cerebellum tissue as brain tissue, one gene, cbln <dig> was identified as a deg candidates.

*the superscript numbers  correspond to the validated gene numbers in figure  <dig> 

† ovary samples were not used for experimental validation for the experimental efficiency.

identified deg candidates were subdivided into  <dig> groups: functionally well-characterized genes in specific tissues, functionally well characterized genes with tissue relatedness not investigated, and functionally not characterized genes with tissue relatedness not investigated. for example, among the  <dig> testis degs, genes including cox6b2dpy19l2izumo4prm2tssk <dig>  and h1fnt have been previously investigated as testis-specific transcripts or spermatogenesis-related genes . other genes such as c6orf225c20orf107fundc <dig>  and lelp <dig> have not been functionally investigated in any other tissues in previous research, while the cetn <dig> gene has a specific function in centrosome positioning and segregation  <cit>  but has not been investigated with respect to tissue relatedness. therefore, these degs could be utilized as major target genes for tissue specific transcripts for tissue specific function and novel gene identification in specific tissues. for the experimental validation of deg candidates,  <dig> genes were randomly selected and experimentally confirmed by rt-pcr amplification and sequencing procedures . remarkably, more than 95% of the genes were validated as real degs with distinct expression in expected tissues. these results support the reliability of our sequencing and emphasize the importance of tissue sample preparation when conducting high-throughput sequencing.

alternative splicing  analysis
a total of  <dig>  manually corrected as events were identified in the  <dig>  clustered isogroups . total  <dig> isogroup harbored the more than one alternatively spliced transcripts. the average number of as events was  <dig> , and the highest number observed was  <dig> as events in the akr1b <dig> gene . intriguingly, the human akr1b <dig> gene shows only one reference mrna sequence, while the ebi database of alternative splicing and transcript diversity  <dig>  indicated only  <dig> alternative transcripts for this gene in humans . a careful analysis indicated that as events occurred more frequently in the 5′ and 3′ regions  than the internal regions  . further,  <dig> as events  were te related. as a result, ~17% of the crab-eating macaque isogroups were shown to have alternatively spliced transcripts. this lower rate of as events in the crab-eating macaque may be explained by  <dig> alternative interpretations. one is the shortage of total amount of transcript sequences. in the case of human studies, earlier researches indicated that approximately 40%–70% of genes have alternative transcripts. however, advanced high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic tools have shown that 92%–95% of human genes undergo as  <cit> . in addition, different human tissues show different as patterns because of tissue-specific alternative promoters and polyadenylation  <cit> . therefore, larger amount of transcript sequences and more diverse tissues or cell types could enhance the as information. another is explained by simple lineage specific characters. because, we already observed the differential alternative splicing between human and chimpanzees  <cit> . and, as indicated in the genome project of chimpanzee and orangutan, different amplification rate and lineage specific of transposable elements could cause the different te-derive alternative splicing  <cit> .

transposable element  analysis
recent growing genomic evidence has indicated that tes are a valuable genetic resource for transcriptome and proteome diversity  <cit> . exonization events are one of the as mechanisms that can occur as a result of tes, including human endogenous retroviruses , short interspersed elements , and long interspersed elements . alu  and lines have potential 5′ and 3′ splicing sites for exonization events. moreover, hervs and lines harbor internal promoters that can control the tissue-specific expression of a gene  <cit> .

among the different tes, alu is the most frequently exonized element. however, in our comparative analysis with human, slight differences in the patterns of alu exonization were observed. alu elements underwent an exonization event in  <dig> % of human genes and in  <dig> % of crab-eating macaque genes. therefore, we extended our analysis to all tes in human, chimpanzee, crab-eating macaque, rhesus macaque, and marmoset monkey for the comparative analysis of primates. intriguingly, this extended study indicated a increase pattern in te composition over primate evolution and different te-exonization events between rhesus macaque and cran-eating macaque . although primate gene information was not sufficient to conclude from our results that amplified te composition is a human-specific event, our results do indicate that te exonization events were amplified over primate evolution and notably in humans. these types of amplified te exonization events in humans could enhance the transcriptome and proteome diversity with fixed genome sequences in comparison with non-human primates. however, we also explained the results of figure  <dig> as decrease pattern in te composition. because the probability is very low, recent studies newly raised the alu recombination-mediated deletion  and l <dig> recombination-associated deletions  mechanisms which could remove the internal sequences by homologous recombination of “alu” or “line” elements  <cit> . in the case of rhesus macaque and marmoset, the results of low-level te-exonization rate in comparison with other species are seems to be occurred by the lack of transcript sequences . because most of reference mrna sequences are identified by computational screening without the intensive support of numerous est or cdna sequences.

broad range of utility of crab-eating macaque gene information
the results of our study have implications for various fields of research. first, the massive number of transcriptome sequences  could be used as a draft of the crab-eating macaque gene sequences. in addition, the modified and combined gene information could be used for the production of dna probe sequences for microarray analysis. specifically, the company agilent provides a customized probe design service using industrial-scale inkjet technology . therefore, crab-eating macaque microarray chips could be designed for specific experiments and more rapid and accurate gene expression profiling is possible in a single experiment. for example, to investigate specific drugs for parkinson’s disease, customized microarray chips harboring the  <dig> parkinson’s disease-related crab-eating macaque genes from the kegg pathway database could be prepared.

second, crab-eating macaque gene information coupled with gene information from the rhesus macaque could be used to resolve the mystery of speciation events between closely related species. the average genetic divergence between crab-eating macaque and rhesus macaque is  <dig> %– <dig> %, and their evolutionary relationship is closer than that between human and chimpanzee  <cit> . therefore, large-scale transcript sequences could help to trace the evolutionary root of the speciation event. third, gene sequencing of the crab-eating macaque could accelerate the completion of a genome project for this primate. recently draft genome sequences also available . hence, reanalysis and diverse application could be possible for the analysis of genome and transcripme in crab-eating macaque. fourth, the  <dig> degs, including the  <dig> experimentally validated degs, represent candidate genes with tissue-specific functions. specifically, two of gene groups of functionally well characterized genes with tissue relatedness not investigated, and functionally not characterized genes with tissue relatedness not investigated, could be a valuable sources for tissue specific functional study and novel function analysis in specific tissue, respectively. fifth, the as and te exonization analysis could be used for comparative analysis of crab-eating macaque with other species. although, the data set are not sufficient for other application, our results are to be used as basic information to understand the transcriptome of crab-eating macaque. finally, our open data base are very useful for numerous researchers who are interested in the gene information of crab-eating macaque, specifically unskilled researchers in genomics and bioinformatics technique.

CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced the transcriptome of  <dig> different tissues from m. fascicularis for the biomedical usage. we found that ~86% of human genes are represented in the ones sequenced in this study. therefore our results of gene information could be used for understanding the biological response of the crab-eating macaque for safety and efficacy testing. additionally,  <dig> tissue-specific genes were identified, with  <dig> of them experimentally validated. we identified and analyzed  <dig>  alternative splicing  events and positive selected genes. intriguingly,  <dig> % of the as events were associated with transposable element  insertions. and human-specific amplified trends of te exonization event are also revealed during the primate evolution. our research is the first large-scale transcriptome sequencing and gene analyses. therefore, this result could be valuable genetic resources for biomedical research and improve our understanding of primate evolution.
