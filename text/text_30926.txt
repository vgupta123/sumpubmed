BACKGROUND
ryegrasses  include the economically most important forage and amenity grass species and their economic value is likely to rise in future with increasing demand for meat and milk production and the development of environmentally friendly biofuels  <cit> . perennial ryegrass  and italian ryegrass  are naturally diploid  and outbreeding members of the poaceaea family with a highly efficient two-locus self-incompatibility system. current breeding methods are complemented by molecular genetic approaches, with genetic mapping as a prerequisite for marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning. in the case of perennial ryegrass, the international lolium genome initiative  reference mapping population  <cit>  has been extensively characterised for a range of morphophysiological traits  <cit> . additional mapping populations have been developed and characterised for various traits such as, vrna   <cit> , pop <dig>   <cit> , wsc   <cit> , tc1*sb <dig>   <cit> , lpoa , zx   <cit>  and f <dig> biomass   <cit> . the research focus for italian ryegrass has been primarily on morphological and disease resistance traits  <cit> .

some of these mapping populations were evaluated for the same traits. resistance to crown rust, for example, is one of the most important traits in ryegrass breeding. this is reflected in the number of populations in which this trait has been mapped . major and minor qtl for resistance to crown rust have been detected on all lgs in different mapping populations from both perennial  <cit>  and italian ryegrass  <cit> , providing the opportunity to compare the source of resistance among mapping populations. although some genetic linkage maps developed from these populations have been aligned with each other using publicly available markers  <cit> , the number of common markers among genetic maps is very low, limiting the ability to infer cosegregation of qtl for a specific trait across populations. this is mainly due to the limited number of publicly available genetic markers for lolium spp., and to some extent due to the limited transferability of markers across mapping populations. while traditionally a genetic map has been generated from a single population, recent efforts to create maps from multiple populations, referred to as consensus maps, have gained much interest in the scientific and breeding community. integration of mapping data from individual maps into one consensus map has been reported in other forage  <cit>  and cereal species  <cit>  and aims at determining the relative positions of transferable markers in order to compare candidate gene and qtl locations across a broad variety of genetic backgrounds. a first effort towards a consensus linkage map in lolium was based on two mapping populations  <cit>  and used comparative rflp probes as the core mapping set. later, jensen et al.  <cit>  produced a consensus map from four mapping populations which contained  <dig> ssr markers. while this represented an improvement in terms of marker technology, some lgs were not adequately covered and large gaps were found on lg  <dig> and lg  <dig>  therefore, a large set of publicly available genetic markers with a high inter- and intraspecific amplification rate is crucial for map alignment, consensus map construction and, finally, for the assessment of co-location of qtl and candidate genes across populations.

ssr markers are hypervariable, multiallelic, often codominant, highly reproducible and, therefore, ideal to anchor molecular linkage maps  <cit> . gene-associated ssrs derived from ests are of particular interest for linkage map alignments, since they are highly transferable to other pedigrees  <cit>  and may functionally determine trait variation.

a large set of ryegrass est-ssr markers has recently become available  <cit> . here we report on the collective effort of seven european institutions  to i) provide the map positions of a large set of publicly available est-ssrs, ii) to establish the first comprehensive consensus linkage map for lolium spp. using est-derived anchor ssr markers, iii) to complement this map with a reference set of publicly available ssr markers and iv) to assess the usefulness of est-ssrs for comparative genetics across existing mapping populations in ryegrass.

RESULTS
est-ssr markers - a useful tool for comparative genetics and genomics
a total of  <dig>  out of  <dig> recently published est-ssr markers  <cit>  have been assigned to map positions  using eight ryegrass mapping populations characterised for various traits . between  <dig>  and  <dig>  est-ssrs mapped to each of the seven lolium lgs and constitute a dedicated tool for comparative qtl mapping and map integration. est sequences of  <dig> est-ssrs  revealed significant  sequence similarities in a blastx search against the non-redundant  protein database of genbank, out of which  <dig>  correspond to genes with known functions . protein functions were organised in seven groups representing genes with binding and catalytic activities , transport activity , enzyme regulatory activities , as well as transcription and translation factors  and structural genes . these est-ssrs are superior to random dna markers for qtl mapping due to their putative functions  <cit> . derived from more conserved transcribed genomic regions, est-ssrs are more likely to be transferable to other mapping populations and grass species  <cit>  and thus, are well suited as intra- and interspecific anchor loci and for cross-species phylogenetic studies  <cit> .

mapping data of vrna, xtg-art, lpoa, pop <dig>  f <dig> biomass, wsc and ilgi were combined for map integration and used for the construction of the ryegrass consensus map. the lolium multiflorum xtg-art and the lolium perenne tc1*sb <dig> were used to compare qtl for crown rust resistance.

a representative subset of  <dig> selected est-ssr markers was further characterised and used to illustrate the relationships among the individual mapping populations. the number of identified alleles ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with a mean value of  <dig> . between 21%  and 69%  of the est-ssrs were polymorphic in each mapping population. overall, 83% of the markers were polymorphic in at least one mapping family.

ssr consensus linkage map for ryegrass
integrated marker data of  <dig> est-ssrs and  <dig> publicly available ssr markers were available for the construction of the consensus map. a total of  <dig> est-ssrs were mapped in at least two mapping populations and served as anchor loci for map integration . anchor markers with a highly conserved gene order across multiple populations, referred to as fixed order anchor loci, were used to define a fixed order for consensus mapping in joinmap  <dig>  on each lg,  <dig> to  <dig> fixed order anchor loci , which were highly polymorphic, efficiently amplified by pcr and revealed easily detectable fragment sizes, were used to divide lgs into segments and provided the basis for the introduction of bins. these bins are representing defined chromosome regions of the lolium genome, a highly useful concept already established in other major crop species  <cit> .

however, the linear marker order between consensus and individual maps was not always congruent, particularly at closely linked marker loci. inconsistencies in marker order were mainly due to differences in recombination frequencies of marker pairs in different populations. such heterogeneous recombination frequencies occurred because the present study incorporated data collected from several mapping populations differing in design, size and marker density. for example, the proportion of distorted genetic markers differed between f <dig> and f <dig> designs. the percentage of markers showing distorted segregation  was highest for the f <dig> pseudo-testcross populations f <dig> biomass  and vrna  and lowest for the f <dig> pseudo-testcrosses pop <dig> and xtg-art with 3%  and 8% , respectively. similar findings were recently reported by anhalt et al.  <cit>  who concluded that segregation distortion was most likely caused by genetic effects. indeed, for the vrna f <dig> population, the highest percentages of distorted markers were found on lg  <dig>  and lg  <dig> , clustering around the s and z self-incompatibility loci located on those chromosomes  <cit> . this link between self-incompatibility and distorted f <dig> progenies has been shown earlier  <cit> . interestingly, segregation distortion of the self incompatible species red clover  was found to be specific for each accession anywhere in the genome.

for these reasons, map integration based on mean recombination frequencies and combined lod scores using joinmap  <dig>  should be carefully interpreted  <cit>  and the precise marker order may need to be verified in the population of interest. in order to ensure an accurate consensus marker order, fixed order anchor loci were used to define a fixed order for consensus mapping in joinmap. moreover, pairs of markers with a significant heterogeneity of recombination rates between populations were excluded. as a consequence, only  <dig>  out of  <dig> available ssr loci were mapped in the final consensus map, i.e.  <dig> l. perenne est-ssrs reported in studer et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> est-ssrs developed from festuca arundinacea schreb.  <cit> ,  <dig> genomic ssr markers derived from a lolium-festuca hybrid published by lauvergeat et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> l. perenne genomic ssrs mapped by jones et al  <cit> ,  <dig> l. perenne genomic ssrs published by kubik et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> genomic ssrs derived from l. multiflorum  <cit>  and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genomic ssr markers of l. perenne developed at djf, dvp and dlf-trifolium, respectively, reported in jensen et al.  <cit> . the consensus map covered a total genetic distance of  <dig> cm ranging from  <dig> cm of lg  <dig> to  <dig> cm of lg  <dig>  and contained  <dig> to  <dig> ssr markers  on each lg , a marker density useful for both comparative mapping and marker assisted breeding applications.

consistency of marker grouping and marker order
the linear order of the markers in the individual maps was generally well conserved . the vrna map, which consisted of the highest number of mapped est-ssrs and anchor markers, revealed a highly consistent marker order when compared to the consensus map. in contrast, the xtg-art map, with the second highest est-ssr density, showed changed orders for some markers. furthermore, the only inconsistencies in the assignment of est-ssrs to lgs were observed in xtg-art, the italian ryegrass population, while no inconsistency was observed between individual perennial ryegrass maps. g03_ <dig> and g03_ <dig> mapped on lg  <dig> and lg  <dig>  respectively, in both vrna and lpoa, but on lg  <dig> in xtg-art. similarly, g01_ <dig> mapped on lg  <dig> in vrna and pop <dig>  but on lg  <dig> in xtg-art. g04_ <dig> was assigned to lg  <dig> in xtg-art, but clearly grouped to lg  <dig> in vrna and f <dig> biomass. moreover, g03_ <dig>  g04_ <dig> and g05_ <dig> mapped to lg  <dig>  lg  <dig> and lg  <dig> in xtg-art, respectively, but on lg  <dig>  and lg  <dig>  in vrna. this might reflect chromosome rearrangements or - more general - differences in the genome organization between perennial and italian ryegrass. indeed, xtg-art was clearly separated from all perennial ryegrass populations in a upgma dendrogram based on nei's genetic distance with a bootstrap value of 100% . although some grouping of perennial ryegrass populations was observed, these groups were only supported by moderate bootstrap values. still, the more closely related populations such as vrna, lpoa and pop <dig> were more consistent in terms of the marker order between maps.

a dedicated tool for comparative qtl mapping
the small number of common markers between various genetic maps limits the ability to infer comparative positions of qtl across germplasm  <cit>  and to associate interesting candidate genes to qtl detected in different mapping populations  <cit> . however, this is crucial not only to distinguish and address different sources of disease resistance in breeding, but also for the genetic characterisation of genomic locations conferring multiple pathogen resistance, as some qtl for disease resistance are commonly detected within similar chromosomal regions  <cit> . the current ryegrass consensus map provides the means to anchor maps across different pedigrees, to establish linkage with genes for agronomic traits and to compare qtl for important traits.

in order to demonstrate the usefulness of anchored maps to compare qtl locations across mapping populations, the two major qtl for crown rust resistance on lolium lg  <dig> detected in tc1*sb <dig>  <cit>  and xtg-art  <cit>  were used for comparative qtl mapping. both located in the distal end of lg  <dig>  the two qtl thus might represent the same source of resistance. est-ssr g03_ <dig> mapped at position  <dig> cm on lg  <dig> in the tc1*sb <dig> population,  <dig> cm away from the maximum lod score value of the recalculated qtl explaining 30% of total phenotypic variation for resistance to crown rust at position  <dig> cm . in contrast, qtl analysis in xtg-art detected nffa <dig> at position  <dig> cm to explain the highest percentage of observed phenotypic variation for crown rust resistance , whereas g03_ <dig> mapped at position  <dig> cm, clearly separated from the maximum of the qtl at position  <dig> cm . based on the qtl position relative to g03_ <dig>  the described qtl on lg  <dig> are likely to represent two distinct sources of crown rust resistance. the present consensus map indicates ssr markers that are located in this region and can be used for further mapping efforts. moreover, the density of mapped est sequences described in this paper also delivers a valuable resource for developing cross species genomic alignments, i.e., for cross-referencing between lolium, and other grasses such as wheat, barley, rice and brachypodium. these inter-species alignments are fundamental for transferring information between crop species and between crop and model species.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has greatly increased the number of gene-derived ssr markers with known map positions as a tool for comparative qtl mapping in ryegrass and will facilitate a rapid transfer of linkage information between different ryegrass maps and eventually across related species. overall, this consensus map, containing a large set of publicly available lolium est-ssrs, represents a major consolidation of existing ryegrass genetic mapping information and will prove to be an asset in the development of both molecular breeding for ryegrass and comparative genetics and genomics within the grasses.
