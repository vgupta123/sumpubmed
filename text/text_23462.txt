BACKGROUND
ammopiptanthus mongolicus  cheng f. is an endangered angiosperm genus  mainly distributed in the deserts of eastern central asia  <cit> . as the only evergreen broad-leaved shrub in this area, it is particularly important for the ecological-environmental stability of native habitats  <cit> . moreover, the increasing desertification in central asia is gradually becoming more serious in recent years  <cit> . due to the important role that a. mongolicus plays in fixing moving sands and delaying further desertification, the protection and research on a. mongolicus are becoming particularly important and necessary  <cit> . former studies on a. mongolicus have shown its capacity of resisting high solar radiation, heat, cold, and drought stresses  <cit> . some genes involved in drought, cold, heat, and salinity tolerance have been identified, such as amcbl <dig> <cit> , amlea <cit> amvp <dig> <cit> , amnhx <dig> <cit>  and amcip <cit> . however, these studies on a. mongolicus are still limited and genomic resources of a. mongolicus  are also scarce. the ability to survive at −30°c or lower temperatures makes a. mongolicus an ideal model for studying mechanisms of cold tolerance in plants. therefore deeper understanding on genes expression profile of a. mongolicus under cold stress would be significative and imperative.

cold acclimation; i.e., enhancement of the freezing tolerance of plants after low temperature stress, has been observed in many plants, including arabidopsis <cit> , oryza sativa <cit> , triticum aestivum <cit> , and a. mongolicus <cit> . during this process, plants alter the expression of certain genes as well as the biosynthesis of amino acids and soluble sugars. to elucidate the mechanism underlying cold acclimation, it is important to determine how plants alter gene expression in response to this biological process  <cit> .

compared with the traditional sanger method, which is expensive and time consuming, next-generation sequencing  technologies or massively parallel sequencing technologies  are much simpler and more cost-effective  <cit> . furthermore, these high-throughput rna sequencing  technologies have other advantages, such as accuracy and sensitivity for both low- and high-level gene expression  <cit> , and facilitate rapid identification and analysis of the vast majority of transcriptomes  <cit> . three main commercially available next-generation sequencing technologies are extant; namely, abi/solid, 454/roche and illumina/solexa  <cit> . illumina/solexa has been successfully applied to transcriptome sequencing of many plant species, including populus euphratica <cit> , aegilops variabilis <cit>  , brassica napus <cit> , zea mays <cit> , arachis hypogaea <cit> , and picrorhiza kurrooa <cit> .

here, we describe the first transcriptome sequencing of a. mongolicus under cold-acclimation conditions using a next-generation sequencing technology, illumina/solexa. we sequenced two cdna libraries  of living a. mongolicus tissues, and got an unprecedented amount of data. all sequences were deposited in short read archive  division of the genbank repository . genes identified in this study expanded the available est resources of a. mongolicus. moreover, the analyses on differentially expressed genes under cold stress also furthers our understanding of the cold response mechanism of a. mongolicus, and the cold-related genes would also contribute to provide a method of developing cold-tolerant plants through genetic manipulation.

RESULTS
genome-size estimates
we determined the genome size of a. mongolicus by flow cytometry using cotyledons nuclei with maize  as an internal standard. the result showed that the genome size of a. mongolicus  was approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mb , which was similar to that of another legume, the chick pea   <cit> . this is the first report of the genome size of a. mongolicus as far as we know. it is helpful to determine the sequencing depth.

1nuclei from maize young leaves serve as a size standard, which has a haploid genome size of 2500 mb.

illumina sequencing and reads assembly
the two libraries , were sequenced respectively using illumina hiseq™  <dig>  the total clean nucleotides generated from each sample exceeded  <dig>  gb, that is, an unprecedented depth of seven times  as much as the genome size . we obtained approximately  <dig> million raw reads for the cold-treated sample  and  <dig> million for the control sample . we discarded low-quality reads, which contained adapters and unknown or low-quality bases, according to our bioinformatics analysis. a total of  <dig> million and  <dig> million clean reads were obtained from ct and ck samples, respectively. of these clean reads, the total length was  <dig>  ×  <dig> nt and the q <dig> percentage  was over 97% for both samples. all clean reads were also deposited in the national center for biotechnology information  and can be accessed in the short read archive  under the accession number sra <dig> 

transcriptome de novo assembly was performed using trinity, a short reads assembling program  <cit> , which generated  <dig>   and  <dig>  contigs  . in both samples, the average contig size exceeded  <dig> nt, with the n <dig> of  <dig> nt. the contigs of each sample were then connected into unigenes, generating  <dig>  and  <dig> unigenes , respectively. after long-sequence clustering between both samples,  <dig> all-unigenes were obtained. the sequencing coverage ranged from 1- to 66245-fold . the total length was  <dig> , <dig> nt, with a mean length of  <dig> nt and an n <dig> of  <dig> nt . each all-unigene was longer than  <dig> nt, and  <dig>  unigenes were  <dig> to  <dig> nt. also,  <dig>  unigenes were longer than  <dig> nt. the size distribution of the contigs and unigenes is shown in figure  <dig> 

functional annotation and classification
we next performed blast  analysis of the  <dig> all-unigenes against protein databases, following a priority order of nr , swiss-prot, kegg , and cog. there were  <dig>  unigenes with homologous sequences in at least one of the above databases. among them,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unigenes were found in nr, swissprot, and kegg, respectively. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were found in all three databases, while  <dig>  unigenes were not identified .

we analyzed the  <dig> most-abundant transcripts of each sample and found some differences in functional annotations. compared with control sample, the most-abundant transcripts in the cold-treated sample were dehydrin, the lea protein precursor, src <dig> protein, defensin d <dig>  early light inducible protein, sos2-like protein kinase, ethylene-responsive transcription factor, and sucrose synthase. the  <dig> most-abundant transcripts are listed in additional file  <dig> 

we also identified a total of  <dig> unigenes genes expressed only in the cold-treated sample. functional annotations showed that some of them were closely related to cold stress, including calcium-transporting atpase, serine/threonine-protein kinase, cbl-interacting protein kinase, late embryogenesis abundant protein, and dehydrin. unigenes expressed only in the cold-treated sample are listed in additional file  <dig> 

based on nr annotations, we used the gene ontology  classification system to classify the possible functions of the unigenes. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were successfully assigned to at least one go term annotation . the unigenes were then classified into three main categories: biological processes, cellular components, and molecular function. the category of biological processes consisted of  <dig> go terms, which were assigned to  <dig>  unigenes. the cellular components category consisted of  <dig> go terms, which were assigned to  <dig>  unigenes. the category of molecular functions consisted of  <dig> go terms, which were assigned to  <dig>  unigenes. for biological process, the top five largest categories were: “metabolic process” , “cellular process” , “response to stimulus” , “biological regulation” , and “localization” . for cellular components, the top three largest categories were: “cell” , “cell part” , and “organelle” . for molecular function, the top three largest categories were: “binding” , “catalytic activity” , and “transporter activity” .

to assess the integrality of our transcriptome library and effectiveness of the annotation process, we aligned the all-unigenes to the cog database and  <dig>  were identified. by classifying the possible functions of these unigenes, they were grouped into  <dig> functional categories . the largest category was “general function prediction only” , followed by “transcription” , “replication, recombination and repair” , “post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones” , and “signal transduction mechanisms” . the categories of “extracellular structures” , “nuclear structure”  and “cell motility”  had the fewest responding genes. also,  <dig>  unigenes were annotated as “function unknown”.

we performed blast analysis of the  <dig> all-unigenes against the kegg database to further analyze gene products during metabolic processes and determine their functions in cellular processes. a total of  <dig>  unigenes matched  <dig>  members, which were involved in  <dig> kegg pathways. of the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig>  were related to metabolic pathways,  <dig>  were related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,  <dig>  to plant hormone signal transduction,  <dig>  to rna transport, and  <dig>  to the spliceosome.

protein-coding region prediction
after searching all-unigene sequences against protein databases using blastx  in the order mentioned in the functional annotation and classification section, we extracted  <dig> coding sequences  from unigene sequences and translated them into peptide sequences. for unigenes with no blast hits, we used estscan to predict the  <dig> cds and translated them into peptide sequences. the distribution of the cds is shown in figure  <dig> 

differential expression analysis
to identify genes with different expression levels, we used the rpkm method  to calculate the expression levels of the unigenes. the result showed that  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated with fdr ≤  <dig>  and ratios larger than  <dig>  the distribution of transcript changes is shown in figure  <dig> 

we then mapped all differentially expressed genes to each term of the gene ontology database  and calculated the gene numbers from each go term. using a hypergeometric test, we identified significantly enriched go terms in degs compared to the genomic background. go terms with a corrected p value ≤  <dig>  were defined as significantly enriched in degs. the go enrichment analysis results are shown in additional file  <dig> 

we also performed metabolic pathways enrichment analysis, and identified the primary biochemical pathways and signal transduction pathways in which degs involved. a total of  <dig> up-regulated unigenes and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes were identified to be involved in cold stress, on which all following analyses and discussions of metabolic pathway were based. these genes were related to  <dig> metabolic pathways, showing significantly changed under cold stress  including genes involved in carbohydrate, amino acid metabolism, energy, lipid, confactors and vitamins, terpenoids and polyketides, immune system, and environmental adaptation .

transcription factor prediction
a total of  <dig> unigenes were identified to be involved in transcription, including  <dig> degs  . the largest gene family was the ethylene-responsive element binding factor family , followed by the basic helix-loop-helix family , c2h <dig> family, the homeodomain-leucine zipper family , and the wrky family.

quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr  analysis
our genome-wide expression analysis results were confirmed by quantitative real-time  pcr using taqman probes. we selected  <dig> unigenes, all of which are known to be related to cold stress, such as cbf , lea , lti , cor , erd , and dreb   <cit> . the ct values of 18s rrna of all samples ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . all  <dig> transcripts showed the same expression pattern as the in silico differential analysis results from high-throughput sequencing .

discussion
ammopiptanthus mongolicus, the sole broad-leaved evergreen angiosperm genus in the deserts of eastern central asia  <cit> , can maintain its growth at temperatures as low as −30°c  <cit> . this attribute makes it an ideal model for studying the cold-tolerance mechanisms of plants. several cold-related genes have been identified in a. mongolicus, including amcbl <dig> <cit> , amlea <cit> , and amcip <cit> . however, for woody plants, the available genetic resources are not sufficient to determine the mechanisms of cold tolerance.

few studies have performed transcriptome sequencing of a. mongolicus. zhou et al. identified putative genes associated with drought tolerance using  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> . compared with this alternative next-generation method, solexa has the advantages of lower cost and generation of larger amounts of data  <cit> . moreover, using the recently developed trinity software, any disadvantages related to short reads can be overcome, resulting in the assembly of transcriptome results without a reference genome being as reliable as those with an available reference genome  <cit> .

during cold acclimation, plants receive low temperature signals and initiate a defense mechanism, including physical structure adaptations , increases in intercellular osmoprotectants , and increased synthesis of anti-oxidants , enabling restoration of the balance of matter synthesis and energy metabolism and enhancing survival in colder environments  <cit> . furthermore, expression patterns of a large number of genes during cold acclimation have been detected using gene chip and microarray technologies  <cit> . use of transcriptome sequencing during cold acclimation will increase our understanding of the cold tolerance mechanisms of plants.

the amount of data obtained from transcriptome sequencing varies according to the transcriptome size of the species. however, the transcriptome size is affected by both gene number and abundance, and varies markedly among species. our estimate of the nuclear genome size of a. mongolicus  using flow cytometry was 2c =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mb. in this study, the total length of the reads from both samples was ~ <dig>  gigabases . this is the first report of the genome size of ammopiptanthus mongolicus.

membrane systems
membrane systems, which are known to be the primary site of freezing injury in plants, suffer multiple forms of damage caused by freeze-induced cellular dehydration  <cit> . during cold acclimation, plants experience improved cold tolerance with increased concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids and phospholipids  <cit> . we identified a total of  <dig> genes  involved in “lipid transport and metabolism” according to the cog classification. moreover, according to the metabolic pathway enrichment analysis, eight pathways, including “biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids” , were involved in lipid metabolism. increases in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids improve cold defense and prevent damage caused by low temperatures  <cit> . nine genes in this process showed significant upregulation in transcripts after cold stress. for example, the fatty acid desaturase  <dig>  gene  was upregulated by  <dig> -fold. the fad <dig> gene in a. thaliana encodes chloroplast membrane-associated ω- <dig> desaturase, which contributes to freezing tolerance by altering the lipid composition  <cit> .

intercellular osmoprotectant
proline, one of the most important organic osmolytes, participates in the responses to various environmental stresses  <cit> . as a hydrophilic protein, proline can relieve the osmotic stress caused by cold-induced dehydration. two genes  encoding delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase  were to be significantly upregulated by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold after cold stress, respectively. as a key enzyme in proline synthesis, p5cs participates in the cold-stress response and shows high expression, which promotes the synthesis of proline for cold tolerance  <cit> . the accumulation of sucrose and other simple sugars also contributes to the stabilization of membranes, as these molecules protect membranes against freeze-induced damage in vitro <cit> . three lea -related genes  were also examined with fold changes in their expression ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the lea protein functions as an antioxidant, as well as a membrane and protein stabilizer, during water stress  <cit> . in a. mongolicus and other legumes, recent studies have suggested that novel hydrophilic and lea polypeptides stabilize membranes against freeze-induced injury  <cit> .

antioxidant enzyme system
when plants are under cold stress, reactive oxygen species  accumulate. these are harmful to both the membrane and related biological macromolecules  <cit> . during cold acclimation, the antioxidant enzyme system of plants is enhanced in response to the increased stress  <cit> . a. mongolicus can maintain efficient growth in extremely stressful environments, which makes it a valuable natural resource and strong antioxidant  <cit> . the expression profiles of seven ros-scavenging enzyme genes  in a. mongolicus were reported by shi et al. and amcat and amsod showed high expression levels  <cit> . in our study, a total of  <dig> degs were related to the go term “oxidoreductase activity”,  <dig> of which were up-regulated. among them, we identified  <dig> genes in the peroxisome pathway, including two  encoding cat  and one  encoding sod  with the fold changes of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. in rice, cat plays an important role in cold acclimation, and the accumulation of sods can reduce cold injury  <cit> .

ca2+ and aba
as an important second messenger, ca2+ is known to play a role in the plant cold-stress response. the concentration of ca2+ increases rapidly during cold stress, followed by a series of signals mediated by a combinations of protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascades  <cit> . as a large subfamily of plant kinases, calcium dependent protein kinase  are implicated as important sensors of ca2+ flux in plants in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic stress stimuli  <cit> . we have identified three genes  related to cdpk, with fold changes ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in their expression after cold stress. abscisic acid  also plays a crucial role in the cold acclimation of plants. cold acclimation has been reported to be involved in both aba-dependent and -independent pathways  <cit> . the type 2c protein phosphatases  abi <dig> and abi <dig>  which negatively regulate aba responses, play a key role in aba signal transduction  <cit> . in our study, eight degs  related to pp2c were identified, showing significant down-regulation with fold changes ranging from − <dig>  to − <dig>  in their expression after cold stress. the function of aba-activated snrk <dig> protein kinase has also been reported in dehydration stress signaling in arabidopsis <cit> . one gene  related to snrk <dig> was identified with a fold change of  <dig> . on the other hand, two genes related to snrk <dig> in a. mongolicus were reported by zhou et al., with fold changes of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, after drought exposure for 72 h  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that the snrk <dig> gene of a. mongolicus shows an expression pattern under cold stress similar to that under drought stress. we also identified pldα <dig>  pldβ <dig> and pldδ to be up-regulated . these genes are believed to function in aba signaling in guard cells  <cit> .

cold-related genes and transcription factors
we last focused on changes in the expression of genes associated with transcription factors. a total of  <dig> of  <dig> unigenes were identified as degs,  <dig> of which showed significant upregulation. most of these unigenes had homologs in other legumes, such as glycine max, medicago truncatula and lotus japonicas, which are known to be stress-induced, such as the erf and wrky families. these up-regulated transcription factors may play important roles in plant defense and stress responses  <cit> . some cold-related genes identified by thomashow  <cit> , such as cor, lea, cbf, and dreb, have been cloned and identified by qrt-pcr showing the same trend as our illumina/solexa sequencing.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of transcriptome sequencing of a. mongolicus under cold acclimation using illumina/solexa. the total length of the reads was ~ <dig>  gb. a total of  <dig> unigenes were assembled,  <dig> of which were differently expressed with  <dig> unigenes showing up-regulation. by performing blast analysis of the all-unigenes against public databases , we obtained functional annotations and classifications. the large number of transcriptomic sequences and their functional annotations provide sufficient resources for molecular studies of a. mongolicus. moreover, information on the kegg metabolic pathways and transcription factors will facilitate the discovery of other cold resistant genes.
