BACKGROUND
there are many types of protein folding motifs formed by simple repetitive sequences, or so-called solenoid proteins  <cit> . one example is the β-roll motif, which at its most basic, is a repeating unit of a short β-strand linked to a second short beta-strand by a turn region comprising two approximately  <dig> degree bends in the polypeptide backbone. this unit then repeats as another turn region links further β-strands into the unit forming a stack of parallel β-sheets, one on either side of the β-roll motif. an example of such a motif from the x-ray structure of pseudomonas aeruginosa alkaline protease is presented in figure  <dig>  the simple relationship between sequence and protein structure of solenoid proteins including β-roll, β-helical, leucine-rich repeat and ankyrin repeat proteins has been well documented previously  <cit> . β-roll containing protein folds have also been reviewed previously so only a short introduction is given here  <cit> .

it has also previously been put forward that parallel β-strands and β-helical or β-roll repeating motifs are found in many amyloid filaments and fibrils  <cit> . to date, the β-roll model of het-s fibrils from podospora anserina  <cit>  is the most plausible β-roll-like model of an amyloid filament and has been supported by recent electron miscroscopy studies  <cit>  in addition to mutational analysis of het-s derived protein sequences.

β-roll domains have been found in a number of proteins, often as a subdomain that binds divalent metal ions , as in the "zincin" family of metalloproteases  <cit> . including alkaline protease from pseudomonas aeruginosa, see figure  <dig> to indicate the position of the β-roll domain within the protease <cit> . this β-roll is composed of glycine- and aspartate-rich nonapeptide repeats with a ggxgdxux consensus sequence   <cit> .

similar nonapeptide repeats are present in the c-terminal regions of the  <dig> –  <dig> kda repeat-in-toxin  family of cytotoxic and hemolytic toxins from gram negative bacteria  <cit>  and the i. <dig> family of lipases  <cit> . in addition, a right-handed β-roll domain containing nonapeptide repeats has been structurally characterized in the r-module of the alge <dig> c- <dig> epimerase from azotobacter vinelandii by nuclear magnetic resonance   <cit> . structural and experimental data suggest that calcium ions can be bound within the turns of the r-module β-roll domain to stabilize the overall protein.

the rtx metal-binding nonapeptide repeat has been the subject of two previous studies that exploit the change in conformation of the motif upon calcium binding. a study by lilie et al. used a synthetic 75-residue polypeptide  as a minimized model of the β-roll domains from rtx toxins  <cit> . the synthetic β-roll irreversibly bound calcium in the millimolar range and showed a change in conformation in the presence of  <dig> mm cacl <dig> and 25% peg  <dig> as monitored by far-uv circular dichroism . the minimized β-roll behaved similarly to the β-roll regions of b. pertusis adenylate cyclase toxin and e. coli hemolysin. the early success of minimizing the β-roll domain was followed by a study using the ggxgxdxux nonapeptide repeat β-roll motif from serratia marcescens serralysin as a calcium switching "molecular spring" fused between two 6-phospho-β-galactosidase  monomers  <cit> . in the presence of calcium, the β-roll formed a  <dig> nm long rod linking the two pgal units, similar to a molecular dumbbell when viewed by electron microscopy . upon addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  the β-roll adopted an extended conformation and the two pgal units became more distant from one another as demonstrated by em.

the success of the above β-roll models inspired our design of two beta-roll designed polypeptides  based on the nonapeptide consensus sequence from alkaline protease  <cit> . an alignment of the amino acid sequences of alkaline protease, brd <dig> and brd <dig> is presented in figure 2a. in the x-ray structure of alkaline protease from p. aeruginosa  <cit>  there are a total of seven nonapeptide repeats that together bind five ca2+ ions to form a right-handed β-roll with three parallel β-strands on each side of the motif . the repeats form short β-strands  linked by tight turns where aspartate side chains, peptide backbone carbonyl groups and water molecules bind ca2+ ions internally to stabilize the motif. the ca2+ ions are generally sandwiched between two neighbouring turn regions which each contribute a side chain carbonyl group to the coordination. in addition, three to five backbone carbonyl groups, and one or two water molecules complete a six-coordinate  binding site.

brd  <dig> was designed as a 34-amino-acid minimized β-roll motif containing three β-strands and two calcium-binding sites, see figure 2b and 2c. brd <dig> was intended to be stabilized by the coordination of two metal ions and the introduction of a pair of stacked tryptophan residues , which have previously been shown to stabilize short, soluble, β-hairpin proteins  <cit> . residues  <dig>  and  <dig>  of brd <dig> were altered from the alkaline protease sequence to introduce a potential salt bridge between β-strands. brd <dig> is an elongated version of brd <dig>  that is comprised of five β-strands with four calcium-binding sites, and also includes a stacked pair of tryptophan residues  as shown in figure 2d and 2e. once again charged residues were introduced to the sequence  to promote stability and solubility. the n-terminal extension contains a modified nonapeptide repeat with asparagine side chains to potentially bind calcium and a glutamic acid residue to add further charged character to the polypeptide. several glycine residues were replaced with alanine to limit the flexibility of the brd <dig> polypeptide. the folded brd <dig> motif is approximately  <dig> Å wide,  <dig> Å deep and  <dig> Å high.

the brd polypeptides were originally designed to fold upon the addition of calcium and form soluble monomeric β-rolls that could be used as scaffolds for the protein engineering of various functions including ice binding mimicking insect antifreeze proteins. however, the data presented below demonstrate that the brd polypeptides undergo ordered and reversible metal ion-dependent protein polymerization in the presence of lanthanum ions. the process generates very long, thin, unbranched filaments that exhibit similarities and differences to classical amyloid fibrils.

RESULTS
la3+ causes ordered aggregation of the brd polypeptides
initial analysis by cd and 1-d nmr showed no obvious conformational change upon the addition of calcium to the brd polypeptides as shown in figure  <dig>  it is clear that the addition of  <dig> mm cacl <dig> to brd <dig> did not change the conformation of the polypeptide. the cd spectra of brd <dig> in figure 3a are indicative of random coil structure, suggesting that the brd polypeptides are unstructured even in the presence of calcium. figures 3b and 3c show 1d nmr data for brd <dig> in the presence and absence of cacl <dig> respectively. the spectra are indicative of an unstructured peptide, as judged by the narrow line widths and the lack of spectral dispersion from the expected chemical shifts of a free peptide. no change was observed as calcium was added, beyond a small amount of broadening at the highest calcium concentrations  indicating possible aggregation. the intrinsic fluorescence of the stacked tryptophan pairs was also analyzed and suggested only a slight change towards a more hydrophobic environment upon the addition of calcium , further evidence that the polypeptides were not subject to a significant conformational change upon the addition of metal ions.

the trivalent lanthanide metal lanthanum was substituted for calcium. it has a very similar ionic radius but an additional charge which enables the ion to occupy calcium-binding sites with a higher affinity than calcium  <cit> . the addition of lanthanum chloride to a solution containing either brd polypeptide produced a cloudy suspension rendering cd, nmr and fluorescence experiments ineffective.

the aggregation of the brd polypeptides was more closely analyzed using right angle light scattering timedrive experiments. a summary of the initial experiments illustrating the lanthanum dependence, brd polypeptide specificity and reversibility of the aggregation event is presented in figure  <dig>  a very large increase in right angle light scattering  is produced by both brd <dig> and  <dig> polypeptides upon addition of lanthanum . the increase in right angle light scattering occurs at around 10– <dig> s after the initiation of lanthanum addition  for both brd polypeptides. the signal is 4-fold higher for the larger peptide. calcium addition to solutions of brd <dig> and  <dig>  does not increase right angle light scattering. this suggests that calcium ions are not capable of initiating an aggregation event. after the lanthanum addition is stopped  the right angle light scattering signal remains fairly constant although it does have a slight positive slope suggesting continued increase in particle size with time. the addition of edta to suspensions of brd <dig> or  <dig> aggregates at  <dig> s immediately halts the gradual increase in right angle light scattering, after which the loss of right angle light scattering is accelerated as more edta is introduced into the cuvette . this suggests that the increase in particle size is caused directly by lanthanum and can be reversed by chelating the la3+ ions. the sharp increase then decrease in scattering at  <dig> s exhibited by brd <dig>  was a generally observed characteristic of the brd  <dig> peptide but was not observed for brd <dig> suspensions. the marked increase in scattering exhibited by the larger brd <dig> peptide relative to brd <dig> at a similar concentration was also consistently seen.

the addition of lanthanum to other unrelated peptides and proteins did not produce a significant increase in right angle light scattering, suggesting that aggregation of peptides in the presence of lanthanum is not a general phenomenon . the controls included a 15-residue peptide corresponding to the n-terminal sequence of m-calpain  large subunit  <cit>    and calpastatin , a relatively unstructured  <dig> -kda protein that specifically inhibits calpain  <cit>  . the final experiment in figure 4b shows that a peptide-free control  did not produce an increase in right angle light scattering thereby confirming that the observed increases for the brd polypeptides must be the result of specific peptide-la3+ ion interactions. the addition of edta to these control solutions has no effect on the scattering signal. figure 4c highlights the specificity for lanthanum  as other divalent and trivalent metal ions failed to produce large increases in right angle light scattering as a result of protein-metal aggregation.

brd <dig> and  <dig> aggregates are protein filaments
four em images of brd <dig> and  <dig> peptide filaments and controls are presented in figure  <dig>  it is clear from figure 5a and 5b that smooth peptide filaments are formed by brd <dig> and  <dig> in the presence of la3+ ions. bundles of filaments, some showing a tangled topology, can also be seen. the unbranched and flexible nature of the filaments is readily apparent. from these em images it is possible to estimate the dimensions of the filaments. they vary in length from only a few hundred nanometers to a few micrometers, although the exact length is hard to accurately gauge as the filaments overlap each other in long bundles. the diameter of a single filament appears to be around  <dig> nm, though they can be seen to clump and form bundles that are up to  <dig> nm thick. the general diameter of the brd filaments is similar to that of amyloid protofibrils associated with neurodegenerative diseases. however, the appearance of the brd <dig> and  <dig> filament bundles are less ordered and much thinner than that of amyloid fibrils  <cit> .

modelling suggests the brd filaments are head-to-tail polymers
if filaments that are several hundred nanometers long can form, then the interaction between the monomeric units must be repetitive. considering the brd <dig> peptide, one obvious area for an interaction between monomers is between termini to linearly extend the filament. interactions between the termini could be of a head-to-tail  or head-to-head variety . the most likely interaction in a very long polymer would be head-to-tail as this unit could be repeated indefinitely. a head-to-head interaction would also require a second, distinct, tail-to-tail interaction, figure 6aii. if the interaction is between the faces of the brd polypeptide, a similar case would occur where there could be a front-to-back interaction that repeats endlessly, see figure 6aiii. there could also be a front-to-front interaction in addition to a back-to-back interaction but this would position four tryptophan residues in close proximity which is likely to be unfavourable, as shown in figure 6aiv.

metal ions must also play a part in the interaction and there are already four designed metal-binding sites in the turn regions of the monomeric brd polypeptides. it is possible that extra lanthanum ions bind between two half metal binding sites, composed of the asp and asn carbonyl groups not already bound to a metal ions and peptide backbone carbonyls, found in the n and c termini of different monomers, essentially gluing two monomers together in a head-to-tail fashion. there are two asn side chains and one glu side chain close to the turn regions in brd <dig> and two asp residues in brd <dig> that could form half metal binding sites near the two termini of the monomers. it is harder to imagine metal ions binding between faces of brd monomers as the only carbonyl donors in this region would be from peptide side chains. the only external carbonyl containing side chains in brd <dig> are close to the turns as previously mentioned. there are no external asp or glu side chains and only two external asn side chains on brd <dig>  and these are both near the first n-terminal turn region.

our prediction is that the brd monomers interact via a metal-dependent head-to-tail interaction between the n and c termini of two different monomers. this is the simplest repeating unit that could form very long polymers. in addition, the width of such a repeating unit would be around  <dig> nm, the width of a single filament measured from em images. two models are proposed for the polymerization of brd <dig> into a protein filament, as shown in figure 6b. the first is a head-to-tail repeating unit where the front and back faces of brd <dig> are always on the same side which produces a bend in the polymer. the second model is based on the front and back faces of the brd monomer alternating, which causes a twist. these topologies have been observed by em. similar models would also be feasible for brd <dig> polymerization.

testing the filament model with a capping modification
the simple end-to-end repeating model was tested by synthesizing a modified brd <dig> polypeptide that was tagged with biotin at the n-terminus . right angle light scattering timedrives using biobrd <dig> compared to unmodified brd <dig> are presented in figure 7a. the increase in scattering response for  <dig> μm biobrd <dig>  was 10% of the response observed for  <dig> μm brd <dig> at the same concentration . this immediately suggested that the modified brd <dig> polypeptide could not polymerize as well as the unmodified peptide. samples of  <dig> μm ,  <dig> μm  and  <dig> μm biobrd <dig>  were also analyzed and a steady increase in scattering was observed. however, even after a 6-fold increase in concentration the maximum observed response for biobrd <dig>  was only two thirds of that for  <dig> μm brd <dig> . once again, the aggregation causing an increase in right angle light scattering was reversible upon addition of edta as shown by the drop in signal beginning at  <dig> s and a return to baseline levels by  <dig> s. however, less edta was required to reduce scattering to the pre-la3+ baseline for the biobrd <dig> samples than for brd <dig>  scattering signals were reduced to baseline levels after  <dig> s for the 10– <dig> μm biobrd <dig> samples .

the addition of biobrd <dig> to brd <dig> severely disrupts filament formation . samples all contained a total peptide concentration of  <dig> μm but were comprised of a mixture of biobrd <dig> and brd <dig> peptides. samples contained a  <dig> to  <dig> ,  <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig>  molar excess of unmodified brd <dig>  these samples were compared to the brd <dig>  and biobrd <dig>  data from figure 7a. hardly any increase in scattering was observed with the  <dig> to  <dig> mixture of brd <dig> to biobrd <dig>  while even at  <dig> to  <dig> brd <dig> to biobrd <dig>  the maximum scattering increase was only 24% of that for the same total concentration of brd <dig> alone . intermediate ratios of the brd polypeptides showed a slight increase in scattering in proportion to the amount of brd <dig> present but the increase in scattering was unstable as shown by the negative slope for each of the datasets.

further evidence for the disruption of filament formation by modifying the n-terminus of brd <dig> was provided by em images of samples containing a range of brd <dig> to biobrd <dig> ratios in the presence of lanthanum, which are summarized in figure  <dig>  biobrd <dig> in lanthanum  produced no visible filaments while the  <dig> to  <dig> mixture of brd <dig> to biobrd <dig>  produced only a few short filaments. increasing the ratio to  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> produced an increase in the quantity and length of filaments observed . a  <dig> to  <dig> excess of brd <dig> over biobrd <dig> produced filaments that were similar in appearance and almost as long and abundant as conditions containing only unmodified brd <dig> .

controlling filament length by capping
data collected by right angle light scattering and em suggested that the length and abundance of the brd filaments could be controlled by varying the amount of biobrd <dig> relative to unmodified brd <dig>  to test this, dynamic right angle light scattering  was employed to analyze the relationship between particle size and the ratio of brd <dig> to biobrd <dig>  a range of solutions was tested in triplicate and the average hydrodynamic radius plotted against the amount of biobrd <dig> in the solution as shown in figure  <dig>  the inverse relationship between hydrodynamic radius  and the amount of biobrd <dig>  is pronounced and appears to have two phases. the initial phase is a linear increase in particle size between 100% and 50% biobrd <dig>  between 50% and 20% biobrd <dig> there is little change in hydrodynamic radius suggesting an equilibrium has been obtained. below 50% biobrd <dig>  the increase in hydrodynamic radius appears to be more geometric in nature and the radius is also more variable as displayed by the larger error bars nearer 0% biobrd <dig>  dls data reiterate the right angle light scattering and em findings that altering the n terminus of brd <dig> can lead to a method for capping the filaments, thereby controlling filament length and abundance. this supports our simple model of filament formation by repeating head-to-tail n to c terminus interactions.

la3+ ions are present in excess over the brd polypeptides
amino acid analysis data are summarized in table  <dig> and highlight the close match between experimental and expected composition of the peptides. only nine amino acids are present in appreciable amounts, of which asx, ala, gly and leu predominate. there are only trace amounts of amino acids like tyr, phe, met that do not appear in the sequence; and trp, although present in the sequence, is missing because it is not stable to the conditions used for acid hydrolysis of the peptide. these data also prove that the filaments are proteinaceous in nature. amino acid analysis data also allowed an estimation of the amount of peptide that aggregates. compared to values for the starting solution of brd <dig>  the pellet and the remaining supernatant, around 75% of the peptide formed aggregates. elemental analysis of the same samples for la3+ suggested that the pellet contained approximately 50% of the added lanthanum giving a ratio of la3+ to brd polypeptide of  <dig> to  <dig>  this is far from the expected  <dig> to  <dig> ratio. calculations from the right angle light scattering data suggest that around  <dig> – <dig>  μmoles of lanthanum are added to the cuvette containing  <dig>  μmoles of brd polypeptide. this produces a minimum ratio of  <dig> to  <dig> and a maximum ratio of  <dig> to  <dig> la3+ ions to brd polypeptide. attempts were made to wash precipitated fibrils to remove unbound or non-specifically bound la3+. following resuspension in water and centrifugation, the brd <dig> filament pellet decreased in size suggesting a removal of weakly bound lanthanum ions  leads to some degree of filament dissociation. unfortunately, elemental analysis of these wash fractions yielded concentrations below the detectable limit of la3+ by icp-aeos .

a) amino acids listed are those for which a signal above background was measured. asx is the combination of asp and asn, glx is the combination of gln and glu. b) amount of amino acid present in pmols. c) amount of amino acid expressed as a percentage of the sum. d) amount of amino acid expected based on sequence of brd <dig>  two tryptophan residues in the brd <dig> peptide were destroyed during the acid hydrolysis and derivatization of the resulting amino acids prior to amino acid analysis, which accounts for the remaining  <dig> % of the total picomoles of sample.

the brd filaments are not amyloid fibrils
finally, the brd filaments were analyzed for their similarity to amyloid fibrils. two standard spectrometric assays were used, thioflavin t binding  <cit>  and congo red binding  <cit> . brd <dig> filaments had much lower fluorescent emission at  <dig> nm  compared to a sample of aβ <dig> amyloid fibrils  in the presence of thioflavin t. in addition, brd <dig> filaments did not produce a characteristic spectral shift towards  <dig> nm upon congo red binding compared to serum amyloid a fibrils . the a540nm/a480nm for brd <dig> was  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  for serum amyloid a fibrils. control experiments using aβ- <dig> in the presence and absence of  <dig> mm lacl <dig> demonstrated that lanthanum had no intrinsic affect on amyloid fibril staining using thioflavin t and congo red .

discussion
it is clear that these brd polypeptides have some very interesting and unusual properties. in the presence of la3+ they form long, thin, unbranched filaments with some tendency to associate side by side to form bundles up to  <dig> nm thick and/or become tangled. we propose a model for these based on a simple head-to-tail repeating unit of brd monomers that interact via the n- and c-terminal regions with lanthanum ions bound to the designed metal-binding sites. lanthanum ions may also interact with charged side chains between the n and c termini of two different monomers, effectively linking the brd monomers together. this model allows for the polymerization of the brd monomer by the formation of very long continuous parallel β-sheets. these long β-sheets can then interact with more lanthanum ions via charged side chains and form bridged interactions with other β-roll filaments, allowing for the formation of filament bundles. branched filaments would be unlikely to form if this model holds true as the head-to-tail interaction does not allow for two brd monomers to interact at the c terminus of a single monomer. experimental data support this suggestion as branched filaments have not been observed by em.

the addition of edta causes the filaments to readily disassociate and dissolve. this is a novel feature as peptide aggregates are often very hard to resolubilize. amino acid analysis proved that the filaments are proteinaceous, with a profile that matches the composition of the brd polypeptides. therefore, the observed increase in right angle light scattering is not simply due to a precipitate of insoluble lanthanum compounds. one explanation for disassembly of the filaments in edta would be removal of la3+ from the monomer interface thereby destabilizing the structure of the building block. if this happened randomly along the filament the internal breaks would quickly cause filament disassembly. the exact amount of edta required to disassociate the β-roll filaments is unclear but based on right angle light scattering timedrive data in figure  <dig>  edta begins to have an effect relatively early in its introduction to the sample  but it takes around  <dig> s for the signal to return to baseline. this is twice the length of the lanthanum injection time course although the lanthanum stock is  <dig> m whereas the edta stock is  <dig>  m which suggests an equal amount of edta is required. presumably, edta would first bind any free la3+ then begin to remove la3+ ions from the filaments leading to disassociation. the dissolution of some of the brd filaments under washing conditions suggests that a portion of la3+ is bound weakly, most likely the ions bound between brd monomers and any non-specifically bound ions. the stability constant  of the la3+-edta complex is  <dig>  ×  <dig> mol- <dig>  <cit> , and as the dissociation constant  = 1/kstab, the kd for la3+-edta is  <dig>  × 10- <dig> mol- <dig>  this binding is  <dig>  times tighter than that between edta and ca2+. edta therefore has such a strong affinity for la3+ ions that it will likely outcompete the affinity of la3+ for the designed metal-binding sites in the brd polypeptides. even if the lanthanum were bound tightly to the polypeptide, edta would be able to form stable complexes and lead to dissociation of the brd filaments.

the brd filaments only form in the presence of peptide and lanthanum ions. several controls where carried out using divalent and trivalent metal ions  and none of these metals gave an increase in right angle light scattering due to filament formation, as shown in figure 4c. other lanthanoid metals were tested  and some of these gave small right angle light scattering increases. however, no filaments were visible by em . it is interesting to note that studies on the r-module of alge <dig> from azotobactor vinelandii, where the lanthanide thulium was used in place of calcium, gave a precipitate at  <dig> mm or higher thulium  <cit> . thulium ions were also shown to be binding to negative residues on the surface of the r-module and in the unordered c-terminal region. the precipitate was not analyzed further so it is not known if protein filaments formed.

amino acid analysis and elemental analysis data suggest that around  <dig> la3+ ions are present for every brd monomer and not all of the peptide and metal present in solution forms filamentous aggregates. a slightly lower ratio was obtained from right angle light scattering data but lanthanum is clearly in excess and therefore cannot simply be binding just to the four designed calcium-binding sites in the brd polypeptides. analysis of stained but unwashed em grids showed a huge amount of electron density which was easily washed off by rinsing the grids in water before placing them on the em. this may be excess lanthanum that precipitates with the filaments, artificially raising the amount of lanthanum associated with the peptide filaments.

the brd filaments are similar in diameter and appearance to some amyloid protofibrils  <cit>  but do not always form highly ordered bundles. the bundles that do form are not as thick as those seen for amyloid under em and atomic force microscopy   <cit> . there is also variability in the length of the filaments. filament length increases as a function of time; longer growth times produce longer fibrils. on a short time scale, the scattering of samples in the presence of lanthanum would slowly increase until the addition of edta was initiated, suggesting that the filaments were increasing in size. on a longer time scale, samples that were set up for em showed a general increase in filament length the longer they were incubated on the em grids prior to staining. this suggests the filaments are growing from a nucleus and additional brd monomers are added to the ends of the filament nucleus. in addition, the scattering responses of brd <dig> polypeptides were larger than those seen for brd <dig> polypeptides at an identical concentration. the brd <dig> polypeptide is  <dig> amino acid longer  than brd <dig> and  <dig>  kda larger in mass. the difference in size and mass between these two polypeptides would be magnified in a filament where the units repeat and could explain the higher scattering responses for brd <dig> filaments. the models we present in figure  <dig> fit the experimental data and the continual addition of further brd polypeptides via n- to c-terminal interactions could produce filaments that are hundreds of nanometers in length. the model assumes the peptides do adopt a β-roll-like conformation as the diameter of a single filament  closely matches that of the β-roll peptide model  in figure  <dig> 

the modification of brd <dig> with an n-terminal biotin residue lends further support to our model of filament formation. the modified peptide can clearly inhibit filament formation and does not form filaments alone. therefore, the n terminus of the brd peptide is important in the aggregation process. the ability to exert some control over filament length and abundance by altering the amount of biobrd <dig> is of great interest and practical application. this capping strategy could be altered to have other modified brd polypeptides with biotin or other functional groups positioned elsewhere on the brd unit which would allow for decoration of the filaments with other moieties such as enzyme subunits, fluorescent tags or antibodies. the degree of decoration could be controlled in an analogous manner to the capping strategy. a higher proportion of modified brd monomers would lead to more decoration and vice versa. in theory it is possible that a filament could be grown with a core of brd <dig> peptides, an n-terminal cap and several different modified brd polypeptides. protein and peptide-based nanomaterials are of great interest and have many potential applications, several of which have been reported recently  <cit> .

the aggregation of β-sheet rich proteins is not uncommon as β-strands are intrinsically insoluble  <cit>  and nature has evolved several ways in which to avoid the aggregation of proteins containing β-sheets  <cit> . the de novo design of soluble β-sheet proteins has proven to be particularly challenging but there have been some notable successes  <cit> . with the challenges of designing soluble β-sheet proteins in mind, it is unsurprising that many designed β-sheet proteins form aggregates  and some of these are fibrillar in nature  <cit> . it is also possible to convert a protein that would normally from ordered aggregates into a soluble monomeric from  <cit>  or assembly can be blocked by the addition of various inhibitors  <cit> . our brd polypeptides are another example of a designed protein that forms an ordered aggregate. however, they can be disassembled simply by the addition of chelating agents such as edta and the addition of a biotin residue at the n-terminus can block filament polymerization.

in-register parallel β-sheet arrangements have been demonstrated for several proteins  <cit> . however, these folds do not closely resemble β-rolls as the β-strands of a β-roll are not in-register. prion protein fibrils have been modelled as β-helical repeating units  but this model does not stand up to scrutiny as well as the spiral model of prion protein fibrils  <cit> . similarly, sup <dig> fibrils have also been modelled as β-helices with parallel β-strands similar to those found in β-rolls  <cit>  but the model has been invalidated  <cit> . the β-roll model of het-s fibrils from podospora anserina  <cit>  is the most similar model but does not rely on metal-binding and is not reversible. however, there is evidence that metal ions, particularly zn2+ and cu2+, are involved in amyloidogenesis and other related pathways in neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

in comparison to amyloid fibrils, the brd filaments are of similar size to amyloid protofilaments, presumably because they share repeating parallel β-strand motifs, but they do not stain with congo red of thioflavin t and they do not associate into fibrils as readily. the brd filaments are also easily solubilised by the addition of edta.

since beginning this design project it is of interest to note that our lab has discovered a hyperactive antifreeze protein from antarctic lake bacterium, marinomonas primoryensis, that appears to be similar to rtx toxin proteins and alkaline protease from pseudomonas aeruginosa. the protein is very large and contains several domains . the domain responsible for the very high antifreeze protein activity contains a putative β-roll with ggxgxdxux repeats, that is very similar to the alkaline protease β-roll template used to design the filament forming brd polypeptides. antifreeze activity is only observed in the presence of ca2+ suggesting that the domain forms a calcium-bound β-roll motif. the brd polypeptides were originally designed with the future goal of engineering an antifreeze protein. at the time, no such β-roll afp had been discovered but our recent findings support the use of a metal-binding β-roll peptide as a scaffold to design an antifreeze protein.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, polypeptides based on the calcium-binding β-roll domain of alkaline protease from pseudomonas aeruginosa were designed and synthesized. in the presence of lanthanum ions, the polypeptides polymerized and formed non-amyloid-like aggregates. analysis of this phenomenon by right angle light scattering and electron microscopy confirmed the presence of protein filaments several hundreds of nanometers in length but only  <dig> nm in diameter. these filaments were only formed in the presence of la3+, no other metal ions tested could induce filament formation. a novel feature of these filaments is their reversible nature caused by the addition of edta. in addition, modification of the n terminus of brd <dig> with biotin produced a capping effect whereby the length and abundance of the filaments could be controlled by varying the ratio of modified to unmodified peptide.
