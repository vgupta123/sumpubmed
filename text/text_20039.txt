BACKGROUND
commercial production of catfish  accounts for approximately 60% of us aquaculture production . however, due to devastating diseases, the catfish industry has been hindered by unprecedented challenges. diseases can cause losses of up to one third of the industry each year. flavobacterium columnare, a gram-negative bacterium, is the causative agent of columnaris disease, which is very common in wild and cultured freshwater fish worldwide  <cit> . this pathogen can infect a variety of fish species through mucosal attachment points on the gill and skin, causing external erosion and necrosis  <cit> . the bacterium can also enter the blood stream and invade the internal organs  <cit> . the economically important foodfish channel catfish  and the other members of the family ictaluridae are extremely susceptible to columnaris disease. columnaris disease is considered as one of the most important diseases in the catfish industry, causing tens of millions of dollars in losses every year  <cit> . therefore, improving disease resistance is a major goal for genetic stock enhancement using various approaches including strain selection, crossbreeding, hybridization, and transgenics  <cit> .

heterosis is an important genetic force that contributes to world food production. interspecific hybrids are particularly effective in generating significant heterosis  <cit> . hybrids of catfish have been investigated for about 50 years  <cit> . among all possible combinations, only one cross  exhibited better performance than its parental species in growth rate and feed conversion efficiency  <cit> .

various techniques have been used to dissect the genes responsible for production and performance traits in aquaculture species. for instance, traditional qtl mapping was conducted to locate the region associated with resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis virus in atlantic salmon   <cit> . utilizing rna-seq, li et al.  <cit>  characterized the role of catfish intestinal epithelial barrier following enteric septicemia of catfish  challenge. wang et al.  <cit>  conducted bulked segregant analysis to study candidate gene locations and allele-specific expression associated with esc resistance in catfish. however, genetic analysis of resistance against bacterial diseases such as columnaris has been limited.

in the last decade, various studies were conducted aiming at elucidating the mechanisms of columnaris entry, immune evasion, and the host response to the disease. some studies have been conducted on the modes and dynamics of columnaris adhesion  <cit> . in recent years, the application of rna-seq has allowed a significantly greater level of understanding of the complexities of columnaris induced gene expression  <cit> . several central signatures following infection were revealed by gene expression enrichment analysis and gene pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes  <cit> . for instance, beck et al.  <cit>  revealed that rhamnose-binding lectin was induced dramatically after infection, which was correlated with columnaris susceptibility. peatman et al.  <cit>  carried out rna-seq analysis to compare basal and post-challenge differences in expression between susceptible and resistant channel catfish lines. some genes involved in critical innate immunity, such as inos2b, lysozyme c, il- <dig>  and tnf-alpha were constitutively expressed higher in resistant than in susceptible catfish gill tissues. in contrast, secreted mucin forms, rhamnose-binding lectin, and some mucosal immune factors were found to be expressed at higher levels in the susceptible catfish line than in the resistant line. despite these efforts, the knowledge of molecular mechanism of columnaris resistance is still limited.

genome-wide association mapping allows detection of markers closely linked to qtls. although qtl mapping is well-suited for family-based samples, association studies, especially genome-wide association studies, can potentially offer higher mapping resolution using markers with higher density. moreover, recent developments in gwas methodologies have offered mature software packages for association analysis. although gwas has been widely utilized in economically important plants  <cit>  and animals  <cit> , it has been seldom applied in fish. to identify the qtls in the hybrid catfish related to columnaris resistance, a genome-wide association study using backcross hybrid catfish was conducted, and here we report the identified qtls and their associated genes within the highly associated genomic regions.

RESULTS
mortality rate
the accumulative mortality rate was  <dig> %. a total of  <dig>  channel catfish from a mix of six families were pooled and communally challenged. the mortalities started 46 hours after challenge and peaked approximately 218 hours after challenge . based on the selective genotyping method  <cit> , the blood samples of the first  <dig> dead fish were collected, serving as the “susceptible” fish. after 12 days of challenge,  <dig> fish survived. from the survivors,  <dig> fish without symptoms of columnaris were randomly collected as the “resistant” fish.figure  <dig>

sample structure
the founders of the  <dig> families were known before the experiment, but the offspring were mixed for communal culture. in order to assign the genotyped fish to each of the six families, cluster analysis was conducted according to the ibs kinship matrix . with known family pedigree, principal component analysis was conducted using eigenvalues as coordinates to visualize the sample structure. as shown in figure  <dig>  apparently, families  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were highly related, while families  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were distantly related.table  <dig>

analysis of linkage disequilibrium  blocks
the ld block was defined as a set of contiguous snps with the minimum pairwise r <dig> value exceeding  <dig>   <cit> . the number of independent snp markers and ld blocks was  <dig> . thus the threshold p-value for genome-wide significance was  <dig> /14420= <dig> e- <dig> = <dig> ). the threshold p-value for the significance of “suggestive association”, which allows one false positive effect in a genome-wide test, was 1/14420= <dig> e- <dig> = <dig> ).

additional analysis was conducted with the chromosomal region where the significantly associated qtl is located on linkage group  <dig>  a set of  <dig> most significant snps are listed in table  <dig>  these snps are all significantly associated with columnaris resistance at the genome level  >  <dig> ). these snps are all located in a genomic region on linkage group  <dig> from  <dig> ,819 bp to  <dig> ,023 bp, spanning a total of approximately  <dig> kb. their minor allele frequencies vary between  <dig> - <dig> , and their nearby genes are listed in table  <dig>  because family-based population with  <dig> founders were utilized, the haplotypes extend very long regions as expected .table  <dig>

emmax was used to investigate the contribution of the significantly associated qtl to the phenotype. because of high correlation between snps in one locus , when analyzing the fraction of variance explained by the qtl, we chose only the most significant snp  to represent this region, which could explain  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. nevertheless, binary phenotype and selective genotyping used in our study may cause potential overestimation of the qtl effect.

based on the snps placed on the catfish 250 k snp panel  <cit> , the parental origins of the snps could be determined. all the  <dig> significant snps are interspecific, which means on these loci, two species are simply fixed for alternate alleles. the resistant genotypes for the  <dig> snp loci are homozygous with both alleles being originated from channel catfish.

genes located within the significantly associated qtl region for columnaris resistance
the genes within the genomic region harboring the significant snps associated with columnaris resistance were annotated by blast analysis against the non-redundant protein database  <cit> . to provide additional supporting evidence for the proper annotation of the region, syntenic analyses were also conducted to compare the gene contents in the genomic neighborhood around the significant snps. as shown in figure  <dig>  the conserved synteny was identified between the catfish and zebrafish genomes. the flanking genes of catfish are all conserved with zebrafish except efcab <dig> and tspan <dig> are missing in catfish and the gene orders are slightly different.

within the  <dig> kb region containing the most significant snps, a total of  <dig> genes were identified . of the  <dig> genes, five genes were found to have known functions in immunity, and these include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit gamma b , cylindromatosis-like , pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type  <dig> receptor , adcyap1r1-like, and microtubule-associated serine and threonine kinase  <dig> . in order to be sure all the candidate genes were included in the analysis, the extended genomic region was examined, and no gene was found with known function in immunity.

suggestively associated qtls
in addition to the significantly associated qtl on linkage group  <dig>  three additional genomic regions were identified to contain snps suggestively associated with columnaris resistance  >  <dig> ), although not statistically significant . as shown in table  <dig>  snps with relatively low p values were identified from the three suggestively associated regions on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> table  <dig>

the first suggestively associated region is on linkage group  <dig>  about 12 mb downstream of the significantly associated region on linkage group  <dig>  there is another locus suggestively associated with columnaris resistance. a series of snps on that region exhibit relatively low p values with the lowest ones listed on table  <dig>  with –log <dig>  ranging from  <dig> - <dig> . in addition to linkage group  <dig>  there are snps on linkage group  <dig> that reach suggestive genome-wide significance . the most significant snp could explain  <dig> % of the variance. compared with the region strongly associated with the columnaris resistance on linkage group  <dig>  the region detected on linkage group  <dig> is larger. according to the linkage map  <cit> , the recombinant frequency is very low on this region of linkage group  <dig>  the distance of two most significant snps is  <dig>  mb on linkage group  <dig> expanding about  <dig> centimorgans, while in catfish, on average, 1 cm is equivalent to approximately  <dig> kb. according to the suggestively associated interspecific snps on linkage group  <dig>  the resistant genotypes of the snps are homozygous with two channel catfish alleles, like the snps on linkage group  <dig>  on linkage group  <dig>  there is only one snp reaching suggestive bonferroni genome-wide significance, explaining  <dig> % of the variance. the candidate genes surrounding the most significant snps of these  <dig> loci are listed in table  <dig> 

correlation of the snps associated with columnaris resistance
conditioned analyses were conducted to examine the correlation of the snps associated with columnaris resistance  <cit> . genotypes of the most significant snp  on linkage group  <dig> were included as a covariate in the mixed linear model. after conditioning, the –log <dig>  of all the other snps on linkage group  <dig> dropped below  <dig> , while the snp p-values remained generally unchanged on the other linkage groups. on the linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  there were also strong correlations among these associated snps within the same linkage group .

discussion
in this study, for the first time, we identified a significantly associated qtl on linkage group  <dig> and three additional suggestive qtls on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for columnaris resistance. the significant qtl on linkage group  <dig> was narrowed down to a small region of  <dig> kb. therefore, in spite of being just an initial quantitative analysis for the complex disease resistance trait, this work is very significant because it has set the foundation for fine mapping of the columnaris resistance genes, providing basis for application of genome technologies for catfish aquaculture through marker- or genome-based selection. additional fine mapping using larger or more families could narrow down the candidate genes underlining columnaris disease resistance.

a number of genes involved in the pi3k pathway were found to be within the significantly associated genomic region of  <dig> kb, suggesting the involvement of pi3k pathway in the resistance against columnaris. among the  <dig> genes found in the  <dig> kb region, five were involved in pi3k gene pathway. these are pik3r3b, cyld-like, adcyap1r <dig>  adcyap1r1-like, and mast <dig>  the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit gamma b  is the closest gene to the most significantly associated snp  . although the causative snp could be within any one of the  <dig> genes found in the  <dig> kb region, the fact that pi3k pathway was reported to be involved in immunity and resistance makes them particularly interesting as candidate genes  <cit> . in addition, many genes found in the suggestive qtl regions were also involved in the pi3k pathway , further increasing the likelihood of pi3k pathway involvement in the resistance against columnaris.

pi <dig> kinases have been known to play important roles in innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . for example, pi3k activity is important for nf-κb pathway activation in different mechanisms  <cit> . it was also shown that the infectious agents can manipulate the pi3k pathway to create a favorable environment by various mechanisms  <cit> . pi3k is required for modifying the cytoskeleton dynamics, regulating membrane traffic, coordinating exocytic membrane insertion and pseudopod extension, which could be utilized by some pathogenic bacteria for entry into host cell  <cit> . ireton et al.  <cit>  showed that the protein inlb from listeria monocytogenes is an agonist of mammalian pi3k, which causes rapid increases in cellular amounts of pi  p <dig> and pi  p <dig>  lambotin et al.  <cit>  found neisseria meningitidis requires cortactin recruitment by triggering a pi3k/rac <dig> signaling to elicit an efficient invasion in non-phagocytic cells. kierbel et al.  <cit>  reported pseudomonas aeruginosa requires the pi3k and akt pathway for internalization. it was reported that porphyromonas gingivalis could activate pi3k, which blocks phagocytosis and promotes inflammation  <cit> . in addition, it was shown that blockade or deficiency of pi3kγ significantly enhanced resistance against leishmania mexicana, which revealed the unique role for class ib pi3k in parasite invasion  <cit> . the fact that pik3r3b is closest to the most significant snp makes it an interesting candidate for future studies.

in addition to pik3r3b gene, four other genes  in the pi3k pathway  found within the  <dig> kb region containing the significant qtl have also been shown to play important roles in immunity. cyld is a deubiquitylating enzyme that negatively regulates various signaling pathways by cleavaging lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from several specific substrates  <cit> . for example, cyld could regulate inflammation and the innate immune response via its inhibition of nf-κb activation  <cit> . besides that, cyld is a deubiquitinating enzyme for akt and suppressed akt activation  <cit> . gao et al.  <cit>  reported that cyld also plays a role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics.figure  <dig>

pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type i receptor  is the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide  specific receptor  <cit> . pacap could activate adenylate cyclase and phospholipase c  through an interaction with adcyap1r <dig> and stimulates camp and inositol phosphate formation  <cit> . in fish larvae, lugo et al.  <cit>  reported that the pacap influences immune functions. they observed an elevated level of nitric oxide synthase-derived metabolites and total immunoglobulin m concentration in serum of juvenile catfish and tilapia after intraperitoneal injection of pacap.

microtubule-associated serine and threonine kinase  <dig>  can interact with phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on linkage group  <dig>  which antagonizes pi3k-dependent signaling pathways  <cit> . mast <dig> inhibits tnf receptor associated factor  <dig>  activity  <cit> , which represents a molecular bridge for innate immunity and adaptive immunity  <cit> . for example, traf <dig> could activate pi3k-dependent cytoskeletal changes and activate iκb kinase  in response to proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . taken together, pi <dig> kinases themselves, or genes involved in pi3k pathway could play important roles in disease resistance.

interestingly, many genes mapped within the suggestively associated qtl regions on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are functionally related to the genes mapped within the significant qtl region on linkage group  <dig>  further supporting the possibility that pi3k pathway may be important for disease resistance against columnaris . on linkage group  <dig>  cysteinyl leukotriene receptor  <dig> is a g protein-coupled receptor  with various functions such as modulation of chemokine gene transcription and calcium signaling  <cit> . g beta gamma activates the class ib p <dig> gamma/p <dig> pi3k gamma on the stimulation of gpcr  <cit> . voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta- <dig> gene was found in this region, and pi3k could enhance native voltage-dependent calcium channel currents  <cit> . diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase  <dig> could cleave a beta-phosphate from the diphosphate groups in pp-insp <dig>  pp-insp <dig> is similar to ins  p <dig>  the headgroup of pi  p <dig>  which implied their competition relationship  <cit> . chockalingam  <cit>  reported that alpha 1-syntrophin could bind pi  p <dig>  hyaluronidase- <dig>  a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor, could hydrolyze hyaluronic acid which could be degraded by f. columnare  <cit> . on linkage group  <dig>  the genes within the suggestive qtl region seemed to be related with those within the qtl region on linkage group  <dig>  because the paralogs of some genes in this region on linkage group  <dig> are found on linkage group  <dig> including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit  <dig> , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit  <dig> , guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta  <dig>  and voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma  <dig> subunit. on linkage group  <dig>  spectrin beta chain, non-erythrocytic  <dig>  is located closest to the most significant snp . with a ph domain, βiii spectrin can bind pip <dig> and get involved in membrane skeleton  <cit> . as presented in figure  <dig>  clearly many of these genes mapped in the significant qtl region or the suggestive qtl regions are involved in the related gene pathways.

it is notable that genes involved in the pi3k pathway were located together in “hubs” that were significantly associated with disease resistance. theoretically, genes that are located together could be readily expressed in a coordinated fashion. however, here we do not have any evidence to indicate that the genes mapped within the qtls involved in pi3k pathway are coordinately expressed. analysis of rna-seq data  <cit>  indicated that some candidate genes indeed exhibited differences in baseline expression or after bacterial infection with columnaris. for instance, hyaluronidase- <dig> was expressed at a relative higher level in resistant fish than in susceptible fish before infection, and it was induced more in susceptible fish than resistant fish after infection. guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta- <dig>  another gene that mapped within the suggestive qtl region, is expressed significantly higher in the susceptible fish than in the resistant fish. after infection, its expression in susceptible fish, but not in resistant fish, was drastically induced. however, because the experimental system is quite different, such expression data may not be directly transferable to our results here.

the most striking finding of our study was that the genes closest to the most significant snps were both positionally and functionally related, i.e., they are structurally organized as “functional hubs”. although it is unknown at present whether these genes are expressed in a coordinated fashion, it was reported that neighboring genes tend to have similar expression patterns and get involved in related functions  <cit> . for instance, schmid et al.  <cit>  elucidated that genes in close proximity are much more likely to be co-expressed than expected by chance. future analysis for coordinated expression of genes involved in pi3k pathway is warranted.

the qtls identified in this study explained a limited fraction of the phenotypic variance of columnaris disease resistance. firstly, the population specificity of qtls is the most important reason why our family-based association mapping cannot detect all the qtls associated with columnaris resistance  <cit> . even within the same strain, various families showed drastically different susceptibilities to columnaris disease  <cit> . secondly, segregating alleles within one species may lead to decreased power of analysis, especially in the case that one parental species systematically carries resistance alleles while the other one carries susceptibility alleles  <cit> . thus the region cannot be detected with strong significance using intraspecific snps. the associated snps on linkage group  <dig> are intraspecific, so the effect of the locus may be underestimated and we cannot infer the origins of the resistant alleles. thirdly, because of the lack of recombination between nearby qtls, the locus with minor effect cannot be detected if the favorite allele on a close qtl with a major effect have a different origin. lastly, but not leastly, genome level variations such as allele variations can account for only a fraction of phenotypic variations. gene expression regulations at various levels such as transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, as well as environment and genotype-environment interactions can have a profound impact on the final phenotype in performance.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our gwas using backcross interspecific hybrid population allowed mapping of associated qtls and estimation of their effects for columnaris resistance. on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  the resistant genotypes were homozygous with both alleles from channel catfish. examination of genes in the mapped qtl regions allowed further analysis of candidate disease resistance genes. it appears that signal transduction pathways involving pi3ks may play a crucial role for disease resistance against columnaris. this notion is not only supported by the presence of pi3k pathway genes in the significantly associated qtl on linkage group  <dig>  but also by the fact that many genes within the suggestive qtl on linkage group  <dig> are paralogs of those found on linkage group  <dig>  in addition, many genes found within suggestive qtls on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are also involved in pi3k pathway. future studies are required for the identification of the causative genes for disease resistance. for example, gwas using larger or more families can be conducted to increase the power and resolution. ultimately, gene knockout experiments are needed to demonstrate the candidate genes as the disease resistance genes.

the most interesting discovery of this work is that functionally related genes that may be responsible for columnaris disease resistance are located closely in a limited number of positions, forming “functional hubs”. future analysis of expression of genes in the pi3k pathway in relation to the resistance phenotype should determine whether the co-localized and functionally related genes are indeed expressed in a coordinated fashion.
