BACKGROUND
a number of environmentally and medically important bacteria produce the enzyme urease   <cit> , which catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, leading to the production of carbamate and ammonia. in an aqueous environment, the carbamate rapidly and spontaneously decomposes to yield a second molecule of ammonia and one of carbonic acid. the carbonic acid equilibrates in water, as do the two molecules of ammonia, which become protonated to yield ammonium hydroxide ions. the reaction results in an increased ph of the environment . in sites where microorganisms colonize epithelial surfaces, such as the normal flora of the oral cavity or intestines, or when certain pathogenic bacteria infect tissues, the metabolism of urea by microbial ureases can have a profound impact on tissue integrity, microbial ecology, and the overall health of the host.

the ureases of most microbes are composed of three subunits α, β, and γ that are encoded by urea, ureb and urec genes respectively. the plant jack bean produces a single-subunit urease  <cit> , whereas, in gastroduodenal pathogen h. pylori, the urea and ureb genes are sufficient to encode urease. nevertheless the ureab subunits of h. pylori can be aligned with the ureabc subunits of other ureolytic bacteria and with the single polypeptide of the jack bean urease. the crystal structure of the klebsiella aerogenes urease reveals a trimeric configuration  <cit> . biochemical analyses of ureases by gel filtration have shown that other bacterial ureases are multimeric and probably have similar stoichiometry  <cit> .

ureases are structurally complex enzymes, and additional urease subunits are required for the production of a catalytically active holoenzyme in-vivo. ureases are among the few enzymes that require nickel for activity. biogenesis of a functional urease in prokaryotes requires the presence and expression of four urease accessory genes, uredefg. in vitro experiments using purified accessory proteins support the idea that uree likely acts as a carrier of nickel  <cit>  and that uredfg form a chaperone-like complex that keeps the apoenzyme in a configuration competent to accept nickel  <cit> .

urease activity can be a critical factor in the colonization, persistence and pathogenesis of bacteria. considering the products produced by urease, it would be logical to assume that one of the enzyme's functions is to allow nitrogen assimilation. in fact, urea represents an assimilable nitrogen source for bacteria that can colonize the human body and there is evidence suggesting that ammonia assimilation from urea occurs in-vivo. a significant proportion of the urea produced in the liver ends up in the intestines, where it can be hydrolyzed and assimilated by several different species of anaerobic, ureolytic bacteria  <cit> . similarly, the oral bacterium, actinomyces naeslundii can use urea as a primary nitrogen source for growth  <cit> . so there is little doubt that nitrogen acquisition as the result of urease activity can be important in the ecology of complex populations colonizing the human body. however, it is an open question as to whether the capacity to assimilate ammonia produced by urease contributes to the pathogenic potential of bacteria. instead, it appears that the release of the strongly alkaline ammonia released by urease is a major cause of the damage to the host tissue, and in some cases, a key factor in persistence of pathogens . jubier-maurin et al.,  identified the nikabcde operon encoding the specific transport system for nickel in b. suis. insertional inactivation of nika strongly reduced the activity of the nickel metalloenzyme urease, which was restored by addition of nickel excess. intracellular growth rates of the b. suis wild-type and nika mutant strains in human monocytes were similar, indicating that nika was not essential for this type of infection.

the brucellae are gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens of a wide range of vertebrates  <cit> . this pathogen is the etiologic agent of the disease brucellosis and the pathological manifestations of brucellosis include abortion and sterility in animals  <cit> , and meningitis, endocarditis, spondylitis and arthritis in humans  <cit> . paulsen et al.,  <cit>  annotated the genome of b. suis strain  <dig> , and discovered that unlike many other organisms, brucella have two urease gene operons located on chromosome i . urease activity is important for the nitrogen assimilation and persistence of other bacterial species like helicobacter pylori  <cit> . we investigated the role of the two b. suis urease operons on the infection, intracellular persistence, growth, and resistance to low-ph killing. we report that the b. suis ure <dig> operon, in contrast to ure <dig>  appears to be principally responsible for determining urease activity, optimum growth and resistance to low-ph killing in-vitro and persistence in-vivo.

RESULTS
organization, and nucleotide and amino acid sequences of urease genes
the ure <dig> and ure <dig> operons are located on the chromosome i of b. suis strain  <dig> . the ure <dig> operon is 5284-bp long and composed of seven coding sequences . the ure <dig> operon is 6571-bp long and comprised eight cds . the urea gene was the same in size in both operons . all the other genes of ure <dig> operon were slightly longer than their counterparts in ure <dig> operon. the urec gene was the longest in each operon . the g+c content of each ure gene was compared with that of its counterpart of the other operon and found not differ substantially between ure genes of operon- <dig> and operon- <dig> . the identity of each ure gene was compared with that of its counterpart of the other operon. the urea, ureb, urec, and ureg genes of the two operons exhibited  <dig> to 60% identity, whereas the ured, uree, and uref genes did not share significant identity .

the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the urea, ureb, and urec genes in both operons displayed great identity with the structural urease subunits of a vast range of organisms including gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, photosynthetic bacteria, fungi, and higher plants . for instance, urease subunits of other organisms exhibited up to 81% identity with the urec of ure <dig> and up to 69% identity with the urec of ure <dig>  the ureases of alpha and beta-proteobacteria exhibited the greatest identity with urec of operon- <dig>  whereas, the ureases of all species of yersinia exhibited the greatest identity with the urec of operon- <dig> 

real-time pcr assays produced amplicons in sizes exactly similar to the expected sizes for each ure gene . the ureb subunit in the ure <dig> operon contains a predicted hydrophobic signal sequence and suggests that the subunit may localize in the periplasmic space. all other ure subunits lack any signal sequences and were predicted to localize in the cytoplasm .

genomic characterization of generated mutant b. suis strains
four mutant b. suis strains were generated by allelic exchange, i.e., 1330Δure1k, 1330Δure2k, 1330Δure2c, and 1330Δure1kΔure2c. the pcr assays produced a predicted  <dig> -kb amplicon from the wild type b. suis strain  <dig> and an approximately  <dig> -kb amplicon from the mutant strain 1330Δure1kwith the ureone-forward and ureone-reverse primers ; a predicted  <dig> -kb-size amplicon from the strain  <dig> and an approximately  <dig> -kb product from strain1330Δure2k with uretwo-forward and uretwo-reverse primers; and a predicted  <dig> -kb-sizeamplicon from the strain  <dig> and an approximately  <dig> -kb product from strain1330Δure2c with primers ure-2-ab-forward and ure-2-ab-reverse. the pcr assays with the primer pairs ureone-forward/ureone-reverse and ure-2-ab-forward/ure-2-ab-reverse confirmed that the double-mutant strain 1330Δure1kΔure2c carried a 575-bp deletion from the ure1da region and a  <dig> -kb deletion from the ure2abc region .

expression of urease, urease enzyme activity and growth rates of b. suis strains
native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed urease activity at approximately 95-kda from strains  <dig>  1330Δure2k and 1330Δure2c, but not from strains 1330Δure1k or 1330Δure1kΔure2c .

in a quantitative urease assay, mutants 1330Δure1k and 1330Δure1kΔure2c exhibited  <dig> activity, the wild type and the mutant 1330Δure2k displayed maximal activity, and mutant 1330Δure2c showed slightly reduced activity . in qualitative urease assay, urease test broth started turning positive within  <dig> h after either strain  <dig>  1330Δure2k, or 1330Δure2c were introduced, and acquired a bright pink color after approximately  <dig> h . in contrast, strains 1330Δure1k and 1330Δure1kΔure2c failed to cause a pink color in the urease test broth even after  <dig> h of incubation .

*a representative experiment was used to calculate the generation time.

***specific activity μmoles/min/mg of protein.

strains 1330Δure1k and 1330Δure1kΔure2c, both urease negative, grew approximately 25% slower than wild type strain  <dig>  in contrast, strains 1330Δure2k and 1330Δure2c, both urease positive, did not display any measurable differences in growth rate compared to strain  <dig> .

survival of b. suis strains in macrophage cell lines
when used to infect j774a. <dig> or h <dig> a  mouse macrophage cell lines, the recovery of all the b. suis strains declined 2– <dig> log <dig> cfu between  <dig> and  <dig> h post-inoculation. during the next  <dig> h, all the b. suis strains increased 1– <dig> log <dig> cfu. there were no significant differences between the wild type and the urease mutant strains in terms of their ability to replicate in macrophages .

survival of b. suis strains in balb/c mice
following an intraperitoneal inoculation, the recovery of ure mutants from spleens did not differ from the wild type strain at  <dig> wks post-infection . when the mice were inoculated by gavage, one week after inoculation, strain  <dig> was recovered from spleens  as well as from livers . when the mice were inoculated with strain  <dig> supplemented with  <dig> mm urea, nearly  <dig>  log <dig> greater cfu was recovered from spleens and nearly  <dig>  log <dig> greater cfu was recovered from livers. however, when the mice were inoculated with strain 1330Δure1kΔure2c, with or without urea supplementation, no cfu were recovered from spleens  but nearly  <dig>  log <dig> cfu was recovered from livers only when the inoculum was supplemented with  <dig> mm urea .

ain trial-1:p value for the difference among mean values was < <dig> . the mean value of a strain designated by a dagger  is significantly different from the mean value of a strain designated by a double dagger  but is not significantly different between strains designated by the same symbol.

in trial-2: the observed significance level among mean values was <  <dig>  <p <  <dig> .

resistance of b. suis strains against low-ph killing
the wild type and the ure mutants did not differ with respect to the survival after  <dig> min incubation at ph  <dig>  or  <dig>  . all the strains including the wild type were killed when incubated at ph  <dig>  for  <dig> min . when the strains were supplemented with  <dig> mm urea during incubation at ph  <dig> , more than  <dig>  log <dig> cfu of strains  <dig> and 1330Δure2k were recovered. in comparison to strain  <dig>  the recovery of the strain 1330Δure2c was nearly  <dig>  log <dig> lower at  <dig> mm urea concentration and nearly  <dig>  log <dig> lower at  <dig> mm urea. in contrast to strains  <dig>  1330Δure2k and 1330Δure2c, strain 1330Δure1k was not recovered after incubation at ph  <dig>  supplemented at any urea concentration . addition of urea did not change the ph of the incubation media.

discussion
the urea, ureb, and urec genes of b. suis  encode the γ, β, and α subunits respectively, and the urease holoenzyme of b. suis is likely to be assembled in a trimeric configuration. the total predicted mass of the b. suis urease holoenzyme  is 91-kda. the native polyacrylamide gel reveals urease activity at approximately 95-kda  and supports a trimeric configuration of this enzyme. the brucella genome also contains uredefg genes  in each of ure <dig> and ure <dig> operons and are predicted to produce the ured, uree, uref and ureg proteins. unlike many other microorganisms, brucella contains two operons encoding urease subunits  located on the chromosome i. based on the similarities of g+c contents among genes in ure <dig> and ure <dig> operons, it is unlikely that any of the operons were acquired by horizontal gene transfer. the genes of the ure <dig> operon shared less than 60% identity with their counterparts of the ure <dig> operon . in particular, the uree and uref genes of the ure <dig> operon did not share considerable similarity with those genes in the ure <dig> operon. based on the relatively low identity among genes between ure <dig> and ure <dig> operons, it seems unlikely that they were the result of a recent duplication event. however, further analyses are required to confirm these predictions.

we generated a series of mutants by disrupting the first few genes encoding structural subunits of each urease. all seven genes of ure <dig> operon appear to be transcribed in a single direction. the gaps between individual ure genes are extremely small , so that all or most of the genes are possibly expressed under a single, common promoter – leading to a polycistronic mrna. the ureg is the last gene of the ure <dig> operon. all three genes downstream of the ureg are transcribed in the opposite direction, from the complementary strand . the closest non-ure gene to ureg encodes an arg-trna. the genes downstream of this trna gene encode a serine histidine kinase  and a hypothetical protein. the distance from the stop codon of ureg to the stop codon of arg-trna  is 124-bp. thus it does not seem likely that the insertion of the antibiotic resistance gene into ure <dig> influences the expression of genes downstream of the operon. in addition, it is not apparent that these genes have any regulatory role on urease expression.

the deletion of genes within the ure <dig> operon caused the disappearance of urease activity on a native polyacrylamide gel . even though the ure <dig> operon was present in the ure <dig> mutant, it failed to produce urease activity as measured by either of two assays. in addition, a disruption of the ure <dig> operon did not have any impact on production of a detectable urease activity.

the deletion of genes within the ure <dig> operon caused the slower growth and loss of urease activity  suggesting that the genes are necessary for maximal growth and urease activity of b. suis. strains 1330Δure2k and 1330Δure2c made by deleting genes of ure <dig> operon did not display any change in growth rate or urease activity, suggesting that the genes of ure <dig> operon are not required for these functions. overall, b. suis is apparently capable of exhibiting urease activity even without involvement of ure <dig> operon. this observation raises the question as to whether the genes within ure <dig> are actually being expressed. our measurements using rt-pcr of rna extracted from b. suis  <dig> cultured in tsb  suggest that all the genes in ure <dig> are being expressed. it is apparent that much more work will have to be done to determine the role of the ure <dig> operon. except for a detectable role in resistance to acidic ph in-vitro, there were no other detectable phenotypes associated with the ure <dig> mutants under the various conditions employed. one obvious question is whether there is any post-translational interaction going on between the subunits of both ure operons. given that there is no urease activity in an ure <dig> mutant, it is possible to conclude that the corresponding ure <dig> subunits are not acting to restore ure <dig> activity.

in addition to the ureolytic bacteria  <cit>  that can use urea as a primary nitrogen source for growth, the urinary tract pathogen ureaplasma ureolyticum  <cit>  and some alkalophilic bacteria  <cit>  can use ureolysis to generate atp. urea, particularly at millimolar concentrations can readily enter the cell  <cit> . thus, in bacteria that utilize urea for nitrogen assimilation or atp generation, the urease activity is expected to occur intracellularly. in most organisms, the ureases are found in the cytoplasm, although there is a report of urease membrane association and cell surface localization as well  <cit> . the ureases for which primary sequence information is available do not have characteristics consistent with being integral membrane proteins or secreted through the general secretory pathways. consistent with the ureases of other bacteria, the deduced b. suis ure encoded subunits  are predicted to localize in the cell cytoplasm . thus it may be possible that urease functions within the cytoplasm in order to assimilate nitrogen. further work is needed to characterize the exact location of urease subunits and whether they play a role in nitrogen uptake.

the ure mutants did not exhibit any decline in persistence in balb/c mice when inoculated intraperitoneally , suggesting that the urease activity is not critical once the pathogen has entered the host. using ure mutants of bordetella bronchiseptica, monack and falkow  <cit>  reported that urease is not essential for the colonization of the guinea-pig respiratory and digestive tracts. one of the common ways that humans acquire brucellosis is through consumption of contaminated milk. brucella needs to have a mechanism to resist the low-ph killing in the gastrointestinal tract. when the mice were inoculated by gavage, the wild type strain was recovered from livers and spleens, whereas, strain 1330Δure1kΔure2c was not. it is noteworthy that when the infecting doses of b. suis were supplemented with urea, the recovery of strain  <dig> from livers and spleens was increased, but the mutant strain 1330Δure1kΔure2c was recovered only from livers. these findings suggest that the urease activity and sufficient substrate is needed for b. suis to cope with the low ph in the gastrointestinal tract i.e. either stomach or upper intestine. similar observations have been recently reported by sangari et al.,  <cit>  in ure-mutant strains of b. abortus. thus, similar to the urease of h. pylori  <cit> , that of b. suis appears to be a factor in coping with the ph of the gastrointestinal tract. even though the ure <dig>  ure <dig> mutant b. suis exhibited no urease activity, urea supplementation raised the recovery of this strain from livers. this is possible because other bacterial species in stomach and gastro-intestinal tract may have utilized the supplemented urea to reduce the acidity and facilitated enhanced survival of brucella. it is worth noting that inoculation via an oral route versus direct inoculation in the stomach may be more representative of a natural infection. however, we chose to deliver a known dose of brucella and measure uptake through the gastro-intestinal tract .

for an intracellular bacterium like brucella that replicates inside phagocytic cells associated with the various tissues including the reproductive tract  <cit> , urease may not be important for regulating the ph in an intracellular milieu. correspondingly, the lack of differences between wild type and ure mutants inoculated intraperitoneally during splenic clearance was not surprising . nevertheless, in the case of h. pylori and perhaps other organisms, urease is an important factor in survival in severely acidified environments, probably because neutralization of the extracellular milieu around the cells is needed to prevent irreversible membrane damage. acidification and subsequent alkalinization in the phagosomal compartment is a prerequisite for a successful brucella infection in-vitro  <cit> . however, the amount of urea present in macrophages maybe low enough as not to cause a significant ph change. as such, the impact of urease activity on macrophage ph can be considered insignificant, and therefore, similar survival rates in macrophages between wild-type and ure mutants was not unexpected.

CONCLUSIONS
the b. suis genome contains two operons encoding urease. the genes in the ure <dig> operon are important for optimal growth in culture, and indispensable for urease activity, resistance to low-ph killing and survival of the pathogen when inoculated by gavage. the genes in the ure <dig> operon seem to be dispensable for the above functions, but slightly enhance the resistance to low-ph killing measured in-vitro. the apparent lack of urease activity encoded by ure <dig> is consistent with the observation by hooper and berg who reviewed over  <dig> microbial genomes with respect to gene innovation following gene duplication . they concluded that most gene copies are deleted but of the ones retained, they function in weak or ancillary roles. thus it is possible that ure <dig> in b. suis is diverged enough to encode a new function that has yet to be defined.
