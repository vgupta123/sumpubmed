BACKGROUND
it is now established that post-natal and adult lungs contain multiple progenitors or stem cell populations able to participate to organ homeostasis and repair  <cit> . the relative distribution of these populations varies between species  <cit>  and these cells are difficult to evidence as the consequence of the low turn-over of the respiratory epithelium  <cit> . the mouse system allowing the study of cell regeneration in response to chemical injury and more recently in vivo genetic lineage tracing  <cit>  has supplied a model to explore and describe epithelial lineages implicated in lung repair. even so the murine pulmonary epithelium is rather different from the ones of the large mammals. in small mammals such as rodents, the proximal airways are composed of a layer comprising one or two cells thick that rests on a very sparse network of basal cells  <cit> . in large mammals, this epithelium is characterized by pseudo-stratified columnar cells together with ciliated, secretory, and parabasal cells linked to a foundation of basal cells  <cit> . moreover club cells, formerly named clara cells  <cit>  are present throughout the mouse airways while confined to the most distal bronchiolar airways in humans. regeneration of alveolar tissue is rapid and efficient in rodents, but takes longer and needs higher level of stimulation in large mammals  <cit> . taking in account these observed differences on composition and temporal dynamics, the description of the resident progenitor populations is of importance in large mammals to better understand the building, maintenance and repair of the lung epithelium. moreover, sheep have a long history as an experimental model to study respiratory diseases. these small ruminants have been proposed as good candidates for vaccine development as well as for comprehensive studies on asthma, bronchial obstruction or infant respiratory distress syndrome. it also provides a very useful model for respiratory infections and lung cancer.

cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung adenocarcinoma are part of the lung diseases that affect the distal lung and could appeal for progenitor or stem cell activation. the bronchioloalveolar region has been extensively studied in normal and injured lungs of rats and mice in response to chemical treatments. undifferentiated cells in the bronchioloalveolar duct junction have been histologically identified as different from the alveolar epithelial type ii cells , the club cells  or the ciliated cells  <cit> . in mice, these bronchioloalveolar progenitors, referred as bascs , share phenotypic characteristics of both club cells and aeciis, suggesting a niche of progenitors  <cit> . they express ccsp  specific of the club cells, sp-c , a component of the pulmonary surfactant produced by the aecii as well as cd <dig>  a surface antigen of the hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . murine bascs appear to be resistant to bronchiolar and alveolar damage in vivo, proliferate during epithelial repair and have the potential to give rise to club cells and aecis or aeciis  <cit> . whether analogous pulmonary epithelial progenitors are present and could differentiate into specialized bronchiolar or alveolar cells in large animals is currently unknown.

we looked for bronchioloalveolar progenitors in sheep by ex vivo isolation of cd34pos/sp-cpos/ccsppos cells. using cd34-magnetic positive cell selection, we isolated a sp-cpos/ccsppos viable cell population from the lungs of  <dig> to  <dig> month old lambs. synthetic media and various extracellular matrix were used to establish the in vitro conditions to maintain sp-cpos/ccsppos cells in an undifferentiated and proliferative state or, alternatively, to induce their differentiation into either club cells or aeciis. the bronchioloalveolar progenitors obtained ex vivo or maintained in vitro were further shown to express genes involved in stem cells or lung development such as nanog , oct <dig>  and bmi <dig> . the expression of these genes was modulated upon exposure to culture conditions favoring cell differentiation.

RESULTS
in vivo description of sp-cpos, ccsppos and sp-cpos/ccsppos pulmonary cells
the expression of sp-c and ccsp was analyzed in the lungs of  <dig> to  <dig> month old lambs by immunohistochemistry on frozen sections using cross-reacting antibodies. as expected, these antibodies specifically recognized cells expressing sp-c in the alveoli and cells expressing ccsp in the bronchioli  validating their use as specific markers of respectively aeciis and club cells in sheep. aeciis were easily detectable in most of the sections due to their high expression of sp-c  and club cells expressing ccsp were detectable when bronchioli were present on the lung section. interestingly, rare sp-cpos/ccsppos cells were observed in some lung sections , demonstrating the presence of bronchioloalveolar progenitors in newborn lambs. among the  <dig> independent lungs and repeated immuno-stainings, the sp-cpos/ccsppos cells remained rare and only present on few lung sections. but this first in vivo evidence for the presence of progenitor-like pulmonary cells prompted us to search for these rare cells among cells obtained from lung dissociation.

to quantify the respective frequency of aeciis, club cells and progenitors, cell suspensions obtained by enzymatic dissociation of lung tissue from  <dig> lambs  were analyzed for their expression of sp-c and ccsp by flow cytometry. based on the dot plot analysis from a representative lamb  and the compiled data from  <dig> lambs , the suspensions of lung cells repeatedly contained 40%  sp-cpos cells and  <dig> %  ccsppos cells . co-expression of sp-c/ccsp was then analyzed to quantify the bronchioloalveolar progenitors. an average of  <dig> %  of the total cells co-expressed the two markers and presented an immunophenotype compatible with lung progenitors . we noted the low percentage of club cells in the cell suspensions issued from tissue dissociation. this may be attributed to our tissue processing. in order to work mainly with the cell populations present into the lung parenchyma, we carefully have macro-dissected the lung tissues before enzymatic digestion in order to limit cells coming from the bronchi and bronchioli. moreover, the number of club cells in the lung of large mammals is lower compared to rodents.

in vitro expansion and phenotypic characterization of primary airway epithelial cells
dissociated cells were grown in culture with selective quantum <dig> synthetic medium complemented with kgf and hgf  on fibronectin-coated plates and maintained for two to three passages as previously described  <cit> . small and large cubical epithelial cell colonies and a few spindle-shaped cells were rapidly observed after 3Â days of culture; the small cubical cells proliferated and were further characterized for the expression of sp-c and ccsp. as shown by specific labeling in immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry, a majority of the observed cubical cells were sp-cpos aeciis, while few of them were ccsppos club cells . interestingly, a minor population of sp-cpos/ccsppos cells, compatible with bronchioloalveolar progenitors, was reproducibly identified in culture . compared to the aeciis, the sp-cpos/ccsppos cells were semi-adherent round cells with small cytoplasmic extensions . these double positive sp-cpos/ccsppos cells were rare after lung dissociation but enriched and maintained upon in vitro culture with synthetic medium .

cd <dig> selection of bronchioloalveolar progenitors
to isolate and enrich a viable population of bronchioloalveolar progenitors, cells from ex vivo dissociated lungs were positively selected using anti-cd <dig> antibody-coated magnetic beads without any prior cell culture step. cell surface expression of cd <dig>  a surface protein expressed by some progenitors or stem cells, was then measured by flow cytometry to assess the enrichment of the bronchioloalveolar progenitor population in the selected population. in the  <dig> tested lambs, the cd <dig> cell sorting remarkably enriched the cd34pos population from  <dig> %  after tissue dissociation to over 90% in the cd34-selected single cell suspension  with greater than 85% viability, as measured by trypan blue exclusion.

expression of sp-c and ccsp among the cd34pos-selected population
to quantify the bronchioloalveolar progenitors among the cd34pos population, the selected cells were analyzed for the expression of ccsp and sp-c. by flow cytometry, the majority  of the cd34pos cells co-expressed ccsp and sp-c with respectively 88%  and 84%  positive cells . we assumed that hematopoietic stem cells or endothelial progenitors may contribute to the sp-cneg and ccspneg cells among the cd34pos population. due to the nature of the antibodies used , direct double labeling of sp-c and ccsp on the cd34pos population was not technically achievable. however, the large proportion of sp-cpos/cd34pos and ccsppos/cd34pos cells clearly demonstrated that most of the cd34pos cells were sp-cpos/ccsppos progenitors. the proportion of sp-cpos/ccsppos cells among the cd34pos population was similar in the  <dig> lambs analyzed independently . importantly, the proportion of cd34neg/sp-cpos and cd34neg/ccsppos cells was very low to undetectable in the cd34-sorted cell suspension , confirming that the procedure efficiently purified cd34pos cells and not aeciis or club cells. taken together, our results suggested that a bronchioloalveolar progenitor population exists in lambs and that these cells concomitantly express cd <dig>  sp-c and ccsp.

to further characterize the cd34pos selected population, the mrna expression of genes known to be preferentially but not exclusively expressed in stem cells, such as the self-renewal factor gene bmi <dig> and the pluripotent state-specific transcription factor genes oct <dig> and nanog, were analyzed. the expression of the housekeeping gene gapdh was analyzed as a reference gene. compared to the total cell suspensions obtained after lung dissociation, the cd34pos population expressed higher levels of bmi <dig>  oct <dig> and nanog, suggesting the enrichment of progenitors during the purification process . interestingly, nanog was almost absent from the unsorted population but was strongly expressed in the cd34pos-sorted cells . importantly, the expression of sp-c, ccsp and cd <dig> was maintained after cd <dig> selection . unfortunately the low number of cells obtained during the selection process did not allow us to further quantify the level of gene expression, due to the very low amounts of total rna per analyzed sample.

in vitro maintenance of the ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors
to assess their ability to proliferate in vitro, selected cd34pos progenitors were seeded onto inserts  coated with fibronectin and type i and iv collagens and cultured with "complete q <dig> medium" under âmaintenance conditions" . after 15Â days, these cd34pos cells gave rise to small colonies of cubical epithelial cells, most of which expressed sp-c and ccsp . the majority of these cells  maintained the co-expression of sp-c and ccsp for up to  <dig> passages  . when maintenance conditions were applied to cells from  <dig> independent animals, the same proportions of sp-cpos/ccsppos cells were generated, and this population of bronchiololaveolar progenitors was maintained over time . while sp-c and ccsp expression persisted, the overall fluorescence intensity of these two markers decreased over time to reach a lower but easily detectable signal after  <dig> passages.

from bronchioloalveolar progenitors to differentiated epithelial pulmonary cells in vitro
in addition to their self-renewing properties, progenitors must be able to differentiate into multiple cell types under specific conditions. indeed, using synthetic medium and adapted cell culture conditions, cd34pos/sp-cpos/ccsppos bronchioloalveolar progenitors had the potential to differentiate into either aeciis or club cells. to induce the differentiation of sp-cpos/ccsppos cells into aeciis, cd34pos cells were seeded onto plates coated with fibronectin and type i and iv collagens and cultured with "complete q <dig> medium", culture conditions that we defined as "aecii conditions". along  <dig> passages , we observed a noticeable increase of the proportion of cell expressing sp-cpos/ccspneg , whereas the sp-cpos/ccsppos population decreased over time . cultures from  <dig> independent animals showed the same modulation with an increasing proportion of sp-cpos/ccspneg aeciis . in contrast, the population of sp-cpos/ccsppos progenitors rapidly decreased throughout the passages from over 90% to less than 30% . under these conditions, no ccsppos cells emerged from the initial sp-cpos/ccsppos population. because we have previously shown that none to less than 1%  of the cd34neg/sp-cpos aecii were present after cd <dig> positive selection, our findings strongly argue for the in vitro differentiation of bronchioloalveolar progenitors into aeciis and not the mere proliferation of pre-existing aeciis.

conversely, cd34pos progenitors cultured in "basic q <dig> medium"  on fibronectin-coated plates, conditions that we defined as "club cell conditions" gave rise to colonies containing primarily sp-cneg/ccsppos cells  after 15Â days in culture . concurrently, sp-cpos/ccsppos bronchioloalveolar progenitors  rapidly decreased, while sp-cpos/ccspneg aeciis remained low to undetectable . similarly to the aecii conditions, we have previously shown that none to less than  <dig>   of the cd34neg/ccsppos club cells were present after cd <dig> positive selection from the  <dig> tested lambs, strongly suggesting the in vitro differentiation of bronchioloalveolar progenitors into club cells. together with the low proliferation rate of ccsppos cells in the cultures, our findings strongly argue for the differentiation of bronchioloalveolar progenitors into club cells rather than the proliferation of already existing club cells in the cultures.

expression of nanog, oct <dig> and bmi1
as previously mentioned, the expression of nanog and oct <dig> is a strong indicator of a stem cell/ progenitor phenotype. nanog and oct <dig> were expressed in the cd34pos/sp-cpos/ccsppos cells enriched from dissociated tissues . to further characterize the cd34pos cells that were maintained in vitro and differentiated, rt-pcr was used to analyze the expression of oct <dig>  nanog and bmi <dig> in the progenitors maintained in culture and in the different enriched, but not pure, cultures of aeciis and club cells derived from  <dig> lambs  at passage  <dig> . bmi <dig> was expressed at various levels and predominantly in the medium that favored the differentiation of bronchioloalveolar progenitors into aeciis . importantly, this first passage still contained sp-cpos/ccsppos progenitors. interestingly, oct <dig> was expressed in the âmaintenance conditionsâ that favored expansion of bronchioloalveolar progenitors, in which greater than 70% of the cells displayed a sp-cpos/ccsppos phenotype. in the differentiation conditions that generated aeciis or club cells, oct <dig> expression was strongly reduced in  <dig> of the  <dig> lambs. however, in lamb # <dig>  some expression of oct <dig> was detectable in cells cultured in âaecii conditionsâ, which is compatible with the lower proportion of sp-cpos/ccspneg aeciis compared to the  <dig> others lambs at passage  <dig> . this result suggests that oct- <dig> expression was characteristic of cell progenitors and that its expression was lost upon differentiation. surprisingly, the expression of nanog appeared to be less stable in the bronchioloalveolar progenitors maintained in vitro  compared to the ones obtained ex vivo, as previously described , suggesting that the cultured sp-cpos/ccsppos cells rapidly underwent a differentiation step.

discussion
in this study, we described the presence of sp-cpos/ccsppos progenitors in the lung parenchyma of 0-3Â month-old lambs. these rare cells  have been isolated after tissue dissociation and they co-expressed cd <dig>  sp-c and ccsp. the sp-cpos/ccsppos cells were maintained in vitro for up to  <dig> or  <dig> passages . pluripotent progenitors are defined by their ability to maintain and differentiate upon exposure to specific stimuli. to further characterize the ovine sp-cpos/ccsppos cells, we first performed positive selection for cd <dig> expression, a surface protein widely described on various stem cells and present on ovine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells  <cit> . a small population of cells  was isolated and characterized as sp-cpos/ccsppos cells. they expressed mrnas for the nanog, oct <dig> and bmi <dig> genes which are molecular markers of stem cells/progenitors. they retained the expression of sp-c, ccsp and cd <dig> mrnas over time. importantly, the cd34pos/sp-cpos/ccsppos cells were able to maintain for up to  <dig> passages in vitro. the cd34pos/sp-cpos/ccsppos cell population retained the potential to differentiate at least into aeciis or club cells in specific culture conditions. the cd34pos/sp-cpos/ccsppos cells, maintained in vitro, expressed oct <dig> and bmi <dig> mrnas, conferring them characteristics inherent to multipotent cells or progenitors.

bronchioloalveolar progenitors have been reported in mice in an anatomically well-defined location at the bronchioloalveolar junction where conducting and respiratory airways meet  <cit> . these cells were initially described by their expression of sca- <dig> and cd <dig>  and their co-expression of sp-c and ccsp. we succeeded in demonstrating the in vivo presence of rare ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors in the lungs of newborn or young animals , while other groups have difficulties to identify bronchioloalveolar progenitors in sheep upon searching for these cells using ccsp and sp-c immunostaining on lung sections  <cit> . interestingly, two studies have reported rare to extremely rare sp-cpos/ccsppos cells in virally-induced lung tumors in sheep  <cit> . taken together, these results are consistent with the presence of sp-cpos/ccsppos cell population, extremely rare in vivo on frozen lung sections and representing a new progenitor population. the discrepancy between our study and previous studies  <cit>  may be explained by the low but clearly above background levels of sp-c and ccsp expression in double-positive cells compared to the expression of these markers in aeciis and club cells, respectively. moreover, a recent study on ovine lung sections, have shown that ccsppos cells were not  or poorly  detectable in prenatal and early postnatal lung compared to mature lung  in bronchi, terminal bronchioles and respiratory bronchiole  <cit> . these elements point the influence of the age of the lung studied, in the search for postnatal bronchioloalveolar ccsppos/sp-cpos progenitors.

the visualization of double-positive cells in the complex lung is therefore challenging and the cd <dig> enrichment strategy enabled us to evidence and to study this progenitor population. in addition, bronchioloalveolar progenitors may be more easily identified in lungs from newborn lambs. of note, we have previously reported the presence of sp-cpos/ccsppos cells in the sheep lung while describing the ex vivo isolation of tumoral aeciis from a virus-induced lepidic lung adenocarcinoma  <cit> . while culturing these cells in three-dimensional conditions, better adapted to these polarized and specialized cells, we repeatedly observed sp-cpos/ccsppos double-positive cells . these results prompted us to go further into their characterization.

sp-cpos/ccsppos double-positive bronchioloalveolar progenitors are rare and represent less than  <dig> % of the total epithelial cells from dissociated lungs. in comparison, a recent study has established that undifferentiated human stem cells identified by c-kit immunosorting are present at a frequency of  <dig> per  <dig>  cells in the bronchioles and  <dig> per  <dig>  cells in the alveoli in adults  <cit> . in fetal human lung tissue at 12-36Â weeks of gestation, the frequency of stem cells varies from  <dig> per  <dig>  to  <dig> per  <dig> cells, with an average of  <dig> per  <dig>  cells  <cit> . our cd34-positive selection procedure was crucial to isolate bronchioloalveolar progenitors from the lung even though the absolute number of cd34pos/sp-cpos/ccsppos cells was ultimately low  and confirmed the existence of a rare population of sp-cpos/ccsppos bronchioloalveolar progenitors. importantly, all of the selection steps were performed ex vivo, without any cell culture steps and in the absence of fetal calf serum known to induce cell differentiation.

the cd34pos/sp-cpos/ccsppos population resembles the now well-characterized murine bronchioloalveolar stem cells in terms of both morphology and cell markers  <cit> . we clearly demonstrated that ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors behave as multipotent precursors in culture and have maintenance and differentiation potential upon modulation of the culture conditions.

we then demonstrated that the ex vivo-derived ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors retained the expression of the bmi <dig>  oct <dig> and nanog genes which are some of the most important markers of undifferentiated pluripotent cells and are major players in embryonic and adult stem cells. bmi <dig> is a member of the pcg family of transcription repressors that play crucial roles in development, stem cell biology and cancer  <cit> . bmi <dig> is also highly expressed in tumors and regulates the cell fate of cancer cells and normal and tumoral stem cells  <cit> . bmi <dig> participates in the maintenance of endogenous stem cells, partly by repressing genes involved in cell death and senescence  <cit> . in mice, bmi <dig> is necessary for bronchioloalveolar stem cells expansion  <cit> . similarly to murine bronchioloalveolar stem cells, ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors expressed bmi <dig> under maintenance/self-renewing conditions, and this expression was not modified by exposure to differentiation conditions.

while oct <dig>  a member of the pou  transcription factor family, is essential for the maintenance of self-renewal capacities, nanog  contributes to the cell fate determination of pluripotent cells during embryogenesis  <cit> . oct <dig> and nanog are among the few key factors that enable the reprogramming of adult somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells  <cit> . interestingly, induced pluripotent cells  generated from sheep fibroblasts have recently been demonstrated to exhibit an embryonic stem cell-like morphology and to express oct <dig> and nanog among other intracellular and surface markers associated with undifferentiated cells, as previously demonstrated in humans and mice  <cit> . the level of oct <dig> is critical for the state of a cell and its inactivation results in the loss of pluripotency and induces differentiation  <cit> . we could observe a loss or reduction of oct <dig> gene expression in aecii and club cells compared to progenitors. oct <dig> and nanog are expressed in lung stem cells, and their co-expression may enhance malignancy by inducing cancer stem cell-like properties  <cit> . surprisingly, nanog gene expression was higher in aecii and club cells than in progenitors in our in vitro culture conditions. nanog expression is known to be regulated by a number of pluripotent transcription factors   <cit> . it is likely that this complex regulation is also dependent of the in vitro context  and others active signaling cascades  <cit> . with respect to the recently described human c-kit lung stem cell  <cit> , it would be interesting to study the expression of c-kit in lamb lung sections and in the sp-cpos/ccsppos bronchioloalveolar progenitors population to better understand the hierarchical organization of these progenitors in this complex tissue.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the first direct characterization of cd34pos/sp-cpos/ccsppos bronchioloalveolar progenitors from the lung of a large animal. while extremely rare, these cells can be purified and enriched from the lungs of newborn lambs. these cells have a potential to maintain and differentiate in highly specialized epithelial cells. the sp-cpos/ccsppos bronchioloalveolar progenitors express progenitor markers, such as the nanog, bmi <dig> and oct <dig> genes, in vivo and in vitro, indicating that newborn lung progenitors retain characteristics typical of progenitors residing in the developing organ. although dealing with a limited number of cells, these data enable the study of the development of the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelia. sheep, an alternative animal model closer to humans than mice, are already largely used to study lung physiology and pathology. in this context, ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors may represent new tools to study lung regeneration or new therapeutic targets.
