BACKGROUND
over the past decades, the scientific community has experienced a major growth in numbers of sequence data. with the emergence of novel and efficient sequencing technology, dna sequencing is now much faster. sequencing of several genomes including the human genome have been completed successfully. this massive amount of sequence data demands sophisticated tools for the analysis of data.

identifying genes accurately is one of the most important and challenging tasks in bioinformatics and it requires the prediction of the complete gene structure. identification of splice sites is the core component of eukaryotic gene finding algorithms. their success depends on the precise identification of the exon-intron structure and the splice sites. most of the eukaryotic protein coding genes are characterized by exons and introns. exons are the protein coding portion of a gene and they are segmented with intervening sequences of introns. the border between an exon and an intron is known as the splice site. the splice site upstream of an intron is called the donor splice site  and one that is downstream of an intron is the acceptor splice site . the consensus sequence refers to the nucleotides, which are conserved or most frequently observed in a particular position. the acceptor and donor splice sites with consensus ag  and gt  dinucleotides respectively are known as canonical splice sites. approximately 99% of the splice sites are canonical  <cit> . as ag and gt represent possible acceptor and donor splice sites, every ag and gt in a dna sequence is a candidate acceptor or donor splice site and they need to be classified as either a real  splice site or a pseudo  splice site.

over the years many computational methods have been proposed for the identification of splice sites. most of those methods are designed to identify the apparent consensus ag and gt in the splicing junction. these methods can be largely classified into probabilistic methods  <cit> , neural network and support vector machine methods  <cit> , and methods based on discriminant analysis  <cit> . neural networks and support vector machines  learn the complex features of neighbourhoods surrounding the consensus ag/gt dinucleotides by a complex non-linear transformation. probabilistic models estimate position specific probabilities of splice sites by computing likelihoods of candidate signal sequences. the discriminant analysis uses several statistical measures to evaluate the presence of specific nucleotides, recognizing the splice sites without explicitly determining the probability distributions  <cit> .

in dna sequences, true consensus ag/gt dinucleotides are outnumbered by many false ag/gts. however, nucleotides surrounding true ag/gts show a certain nucleotide dependency and sequential relationship compared to those surrounding false ag/gts. there are several methods which are particularly designed to capture this relationship and to identify true splice sites among numerous false ones. weight matrix methods  and methods based on markov models are popular methods of this category. wmm was successfully adopted in methods like netplantgene  <cit>  and nnsplice  <cit> . salzberg et al. and zhang et al.  <cit> , used a linear first order markov model  also known as the weight array method  and they have achieved a good splice site prediction accuracy. mm <dig> only utilizes first order sequential relationship. it is desirable to use a higher order markov model to capture the higher order and extended sequential relationship. however, the computational complexity increases polynomialy with the increase of the order of the markov model, and also higher order markov models require a large number of training samples. the maximal dependence decomposition  algorithm was proposed by burge et al.  <cit>  to overcome these limitations. mdd is a decision tree process and models the dependency between adjacent nucleotides. to take the advantages of both mdd and markov models, pertea et al.  <cit>  proposed the genesplicer method which combines mdd and second order markov models . genesplicer showed an improved splice site detection performance. more recently, rajapakse et al.  <cit>  proposed a complex splice site detection method by combining mostly second order markov models with backpropagation neural networks . this method showed an improved performance over genesplicer, however, bpnn is already computationally expensive and this method requires a larger sequence window. in contrast, a machine learning technique such as svm has the advantage of inferring an optimal classifier from the training data. svm has been used to classify splice site data with limited success  <cit> .

most of the existing splice site detection methods focused on the improvement of classification performance. however other studies suggest that, considering the increasing growth of sequence data, the focus of new methods should be towards developing faster methods  <cit> . in our previous work we showed an improved splice site detection performance by using several preprocessing methods including wmm0/mm <dig>  wmm <dig>  mm <dig> with svm  <cit> . however, the training time and the number of input features to svm is a major concern. svm performs better when it is trained with the most important and meaningful features. so, the reduction of less important features may improve both the classification performance and training time of svm. in this paper, we propose a feature selection strategy which reduces the less important features from the input data. we also combine the well studied information content method based on shannon's information theory  <cit>  and the shapiro's score method  <cit>  to extract meaningful information from sequence that can potentially identify splice sites. our method showed an improved splice site detection performance when compared to the existing methods in terms of classification accuracy and training time.

RESULTS
classification performance comparison
our hybrid algorithm combines several effective and informative input features with the state of the art support vector machine . to obtain the input features we employ information content method based on shannon's information theory, shapiro's score scheme, and markovian probabilities. we also use the f-score feature elimination scheme to reduce the less informative features from the input data. we use the publicly available nn <dig>  <cit>  splice site dataset to evaluate the performance of our method. the mm <dig> parameters are calculated from the dataset and f-score method  is applied to reduce the number of mm <dig> parameters, which is referred as reduced mm <dig> svm method. we also calculate the information content and shapiro's score from the dataset and use the proposed the ic shapiro svm method, which is a linear combination of information content and shapiro's score. we compare the performance of our methods with mm <dig> svm method as proposed  <cit> . to evaluate the classification performance we use several performance evaluation methods such as the sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristics curve , and the area under roc  as described in the method section.

as shown in table  <dig>  reduced mm <dig> svm with grbf kernel produces the best performance with an auc area of  <dig> . reduced mm <dig> svm with polynomial kernel produces the second best performance with an auc of  <dig>  while mm <dig> svm with polynomial kernel  <cit>  has an auc of  <dig> . though ic shapiro svm with polynomial kernel has an auc of  <dig> , which is marginally worse than the best performing model, it produces the fastest training time. table  <dig> shows the improvement of performance in terms of auc and training time as compared to mm <dig> svm polynomial  <cit> .

as shown in table  <dig>  the best acceptor splice site detection performance is produced by reduced mm <dig> svm with grbf kernel which is  <dig> % superior then mm <dig> svm with polynomial kernel. however, reduced mm <dig> svm grbf requires much longer training time  than mm <dig> svm polynomial. reduced mm <dig> svm polynomial improves the performance by  <dig> % and it also  <dig> % faster than mm <dig> svm polynomial. finally, ic shapiro svm polynomial is just  <dig> % worse then mm <dig> svm polynomial, however, it shows a significant improvement in the training time and is  <dig> % faster than mm <dig> svm polynomial.

as shown in table  <dig>  reduced mm <dig> svm with grbf kernel is the best model for donor splice site classification with an auc area of  <dig> . reduced mm <dig> svm polynomial is marginally worse then reduced mm <dig> svm grbf and produces the second best performance with an auc of  <dig>  while mm <dig> svm with polynomial kernel  <cit>  has an auc of  <dig> . following the same trend, ic shapiro svm polynomial also produces the fastest training time. table  <dig> shows the improvement of performance in terms of auc and training time as compared to mm <dig> svm polynomial  <cit> .

discussions
one of the biological machineries involved in the splicing process is known as the spliceosome, which binds in a splice site after determining the information available in that site. information content and shapiro's score are two well known methods to determine the information in splice sites  <cit> . previously we have used other methods such as first order markov model , first order weight matrix model  and zero order markov/weight matrix model  to capture such information  <cit> . however, our results in this paper show that information content and shapiro's score are more capable of capturing more meaningful information than those methods we have used previously, which justifies the use of these methods to extract features. our method based on information content and shapiro's score is also proved to be much faster.

we also use the f-score feature ranking measure to select the most meaningful features and use it to eliminate less important features. we use the f-score measure to reduce mm <dig> parameters and when compared with mm <dig> svm method  <cit> , we find that reduced mm <dig> svm method based on reduced mm <dig> parameters performs better in terms of classification accuracy as shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the performance of ic shapiro svm is marginally worse then the best performing methods. however, it shows much faster training time than others as ic shapiro svm uses much less number of features. this ic and shapiro's score scheme and their integration as a set of features is an important step towards faster splice site identification and can be effectively used in the splice site detection for the whole genome where vast amount of sequences data is available. however, it is worthwhile to further investigate this method to improve its classification accuracy.

CONCLUSIONS
modern sequencing techniques can produce a massive amount of data in short time and the number of sequence data is almost exponentially increasing. fast splice site detection is very useful when we consider the very large volumes of available data for the training and testing of a method. to cope with such a large volume of data we also need faster methods. the fast splice site detection method we propose in this paper can also be applied to identify other signals in the sequence such as promoters and translation initiation sites.
