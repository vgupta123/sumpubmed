BACKGROUND
the human genome project and numerous other genome projects have produced a large and ever increasing amount of sequence data. one of the main research challenges in the post-genomic era is to understand the relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the functions of the proteins they encode. traditionally, the functional annotation of genes has been done manually by experienced individual curators with the help of advanced searching tools. however, to unlock the potential of the huge amount of genomic-wide sequence data, it is necessary to develop large-scale approaches for the functional assignment of uncharacterized proteins  <cit> . in recent years, several automated annotation systems have been developed based on homologues identified from database searches, text mining, gene ontologies, and co-expression relationships obtained from microarray gene expression patterns  <cit> . in sequence similarity-based approaches, the function of a query protein can be deduced from those of homologous proteins of known functions obtained from database searches. the underlying assumption of these approaches is that similar sequences imply similar biological functions. since this assumption is true in many cases and the approaches are simple, this type of sequence matching schemes have been most popular and widely used, although it has been noted that matching sequences do not always infer similar functions  <cit> .

the gene ontology  consortium provides a vocabulary to describe gene and gene product attributes in any organism  <cit> . go includes three ontological categories: molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. a molecular function go term represents a biological activity involving one or more gene products. a biological process go term represents a series of biological activities. and a cellular component go term, as the name suggests, represents a component of a cell. the go terms in each category are organized in a directed acyclic graph , i.e., a specialized go term  could be associated with one or several less specialized go terms .

since the establishment of go, many ontology-based sequence annotation approaches have been developed  <cit> , including several web-based automated go annotation software tools  <cit> . these attempts typically involve a search of homologous proteins in go-mapped databases including genbank and swiss-prot. hennig et al.'s ontoblast and zehetner's gob let present a list of homologues together with their go terms  <cit> . martin et al.'s gotcha searches a set of seven model genomes and returns scored matches  <cit> . xie et al.'s go engine combines homology search with text mining  <cit> . schug et al. developed a rule-based function prediction method based on the intersection of go terms that contain protein domain at different similarity levels  <cit> . abascal et al. presented an automatic annotation method based on protein family identification  <cit> . jensen et al. used neural networks for the prediction while vinayagam et al. used support vector machines  <cit> . the appeal of these approaches is that they can directly assign a biological meaning to an uncharacterized protein sequence.

in this study, we investigate the mathematical underpinnings of the automated sequence annotation approaches that are based on sequence similarity and gene ontology. we explore the structures of the three ontology categories and re-evaluate the assumption that similar sequences give rise to similar biological functions. we introduce a novel measure of overall similarity between two protein sequences based on a set of local blast alignments. using the complete proteome from the model organism yeast, we study the degree of overall similarity of yeast protein sequences in each functional group defined by go terms. we examine the effects of the level of go terms and the size of go groups on the degree of similarity. we present the sequence similarity distributions at different levels of go dags and the distributions of siblings of go groups. to evaluate the theoretical prediction power of similar sequences, we compute the posterior probability of the hypothesis that protein a possesses the same biological function as protein b, given b's biological function is known and a and b are similar.

RESULTS
all-to-all pair-wise protein sequence local alignments were performed using the alignment tool for blasting two sequences  which was retrieved from the ncbi ftp site  <cit> . the p-values were calculated based on a novel measure  in methods section) of overall similarity of two protein sequences. the distributions of the p-values are shown in table  <dig>  the first column presents the p-value distribution of protein sequence pairs from the complete yeast proteome. this distribution serves as a control for the distribution of the whole population. the second, third and fourth columns show the distributions for sequences annotated for biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components, respectively. as we can see, the four distributions are quite similar, indicating that the annotated proteins in each of the three gene ontology categories provide a representative sample set of sequences from the complete yeast proteome. on the other hand, we clearly see that the majority of sequence pairs are not similar. only about 4% of the sequence pairs have p-values less than  <dig> .

the distributions of the number of go groups at different levels of the gene ontologies are shown in figure  <dig>  in this study, when a pair of sequences appears on multiple levels, the highest level  was chosen for the analysis. we see clearly that the go groups in molecular function and cellular component populate the third and the fourth level of the ontologies while the biological process go groups are mainly distributed around level six. the average sizes of go groups at different levels of the ontologies are shown in figure  <dig>  we see that in all three go categories the average size of the go groups decreases in most of the cases as their level increases. we note that groups of less than six protein sequences are not shown.

figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> show the p-value distributions of protein sequence pairs annotated for molecular function, biological process and cellular component go terms at different levels of go categories. each curve in the figures represents the percentages of sequence pairs of less than or equal to a certain p-value across different levels of go categories. some curves do not include the percentages for all levels because no sequence pair on those levels has a p-value less than or equal to certain thresholds. for the sequences annotated for molecular function and cellular component go terms, we see clearly that the majority of the sequence pairs are considered non-similar throughout the levels. over 59% of sequence pairs at all levels have p-values greater than  <dig> . however, the number of similar sequence pairs does increase steadily with their go levels. in particular, the percentage of pairs with high similarity scores  has a steep increase from the root level to level  <dig>  level  <dig> has the highest percentage of similar pairs for molecular function ontology. at this level over 35% of the sequence pairs have similarity p-values less or equal to 10- <dig> while for levels  <dig> through  <dig>  over 13% of the sequence pairs have p-values less or equal to 10- <dig>  these percentages are significantly higher than the  <dig> % extracted from the p-value distribution of the entire population of sequence pairs annotated for molecular functions . also we can see that the percentage increase is not monotonic from levels  <dig> to  <dig>  there is a short trend that the percentage decreases with level. we believe that this result is mainly due to the nature of the ontology graph in which fewer go terms are on levels higher than  <dig>  another reason that may also possibly contribute to the result is that in our analysis, the level of a go term is defined to be the lowest level on which it appears in the go dag. for the cellular component ontology, level  <dig> has about 12% of the sequence pairs with p-values less than or equal to 10- <dig>  the average for levels  <dig> and  <dig> is about  <dig> %. we also see that for the two ontologies, significantly more pairs have high similarity scores  at levels  <dig> or above than those at levels below  <dig>  for the biological process ontology, the increase of the number of similar pairs starts to level off around level  <dig>  apparently much higher than for molecular function and cellular component ontologies. about  <dig> % of pairs at levels  <dig> through  <dig> have the similarity p-values less than and equal to 10- <dig>  compared to an average of  <dig> % at levels below  <dig>  similar to the two other ontologies, there are significantly more pairs annotated for biology process go terms having high similarity scores  at levels  <dig> and above than at levels below  <dig> 

the complete p-value distributions of sequence pairs for each go group of the three ontologies are shown in the supplement tables i, ii, iii . table  <dig> shows a typical part of the supplement table ii. it presents the p-value distribution of sequence pairs in some go groups on the transporter activity branch of the molecular function ontology tree. numbers in each row of the table represent the percentages of sequence pairs of p-values within certain range. we see very much diversified p-value distributions over different go groups. most of the distributions are independent of the sizes of the groups. more noticeably, the sequence pairs in the carbohydrate transporter activity group have much higher similarity scores. over 75% of pairs have the p-values less than or equal to 10- <dig>  in particular, the  <dig> sequences in the sub-group monosaccharide transporter activity are extremely similar with each other. all the p-values of the  <dig> pairs are less than or equal to 10- <dig>  on the other hand, the sequences in the go group monovalent inorganic cation transporter activity which is at the same level as monosaccharide transporter activity exhibits much low similarity scores. more than 96% sequence pairs have p-values greater than 10- <dig>  also we see, in general, within one branch of the ontology tree, the higher level a go group is at, the higher similarity its sequence pairs have. more convincingly,  <dig> out of  <dig> biological process groups,  <dig> out of  <dig> molecular function groups, and  <dig> out of  <dig> cellular component groups have higher percentage of sequence pairs of p-values less 10- <dig> than those of their parents . this result indicates the strong correlation between sequence similarity and function similarity/specificity.

the dependence of sequence similarity on group size was also examined. no strong correlation was found although there is a vague trend of increasing degree of sequence similarity as the group gets smaller. the pearson correlation coefficient of group size versus percentage of sequence pairs with p-values less than or equal to 10- <dig> for molecular function ontology is about - <dig> . the coefficients for biological process and cellular component are - <dig>  and - <dig> , respectively. as an example, the protein kinase activity group has  <dig> annotated sequences. about 70% of the  <dig> sequence pairs have p-values less than or equal to 10- <dig>  on the other hand, the nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide kinase activity group has only  <dig> annotated sequences. only  <dig> out of the  <dig> pairs have p-values less than or equal to 10- <dig>  although both groups are at the same level  of the molecular function ontology tree. the fact that most child groups have higher similarity scores than their parents might be the main factor contributing to the weak negative correlation between sizes and similarity scores.

the above results indicate that proteins of similar biological functions tend to have higher sequence similarity. the level of go groups on a gene ontology tree depicts to a certain degree the functional similarity of the groups, although it's far from being able to accurately characterize the relationship between protein sequence similarity and biological function similarity. to evaluate how much protein sequence similarity can contribute to biological function prediction, we computed the posterior probabilities of correct predictions using equation . the results for the protein kinase activity branch of the molecular function ontology tree are presented in table  <dig> while the p-value distributions of sequence pairs for the branch are shown in table  <dig> for comparison. as we can see from the results, the posterior probability of a correct assignment varies greatly from group to group. for example, if a database search hits the nucleotide kinase activity group with a p-value less than or equal to 10- <dig>  one can almost be certain that the protein with that query sequence belongs to the nucleotide kinase activity group. on the other hand a hit to the protein kinase activity group with the same p-value would carry only 13% of the confidence that the protein belongs to the group. we believe that the high degree of variation observed in the posterior probabilities indicate that the posterior probability could serve as a key measure in protein function predictions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we studied the correlation between protein sequence similarity and function similarity for the yeast proteome in the context of the three gene ontologies. the results indicate that protein pairs in a go group tend to have higher sequence similarity than a randomly drawn sequence pair, although the p-value distributions of sequence pairs in go groups are heterogeneous and vary from group to group. we conclude that sequence similarity can serve as one of the key measures in protein function prediction. however, the results do not directly translate into a high confidence of the function prediction provided by automated protein annotation systems that are solely based on sequence similarity and go definitions. these methods can serve as a preliminary tool for functional predictions. the resulting annotations have to be verified through other means. a method that combines a broader range of measures, including sequence similarity, go definitions, gene expression patterns, as well as available knowledge of the organism under study, is more likely to provide more accurate function prediction. our study indicates that the posterior probability of a correct prediction could serve as one of those key measures.
