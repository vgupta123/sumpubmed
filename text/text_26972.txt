BACKGROUND
the mammalian visual system is complex, and the developmental events that give rise to this highly organised system are similarly complex and exquisitely ordered. the timing of the major developmental events of the mammalian visual system has been well characterised, and many of the molecular cues controlling these critical events have been elucidated . however despite our increased knowledge about these molecular cues, they are not sufficient to explain completely the complexity and timing of the development of visual pathways in mammals. it is likely then that other molecules are also involved during the development and maturation of the mammalian visual system, and in this context recent attention has turned to the semaphorins.

semaphorins  have been implicated in neural and vascular aspects of visual system development in various species including frog  <cit> , <cit> , zebrafish  <cit> – <cit> , goldfish  <cit> , and chicken  <cit> – <cit> . in mouse the membrane bound class  <dig> and class  <dig> semaphorins are involved in lamination of the retina  <cit> – <cit> , and guidance of retinal ganglion cell  axons  <cit>  via contact-mediated interactions. however many previously discovered molecular cues in the mammalian visual system are diffusible, and the only vertebrate secreted members of the semaphorins are the class  <dig> semaphorins   <cit>  which are known to be expressed in the developing rat retina  <cit> . it is possible then that the sema3s also influence the complexity and timing of the developing mammalian visual system.

the sema3s consist of sema3a through sema3g <cit> , <cit> , <cit> – <cit>  and their main receptors are the neuropilins which form multimeric receptor complexes with plexins and cell adhesion molecules  <cit> . sema3s were initially discovered as axon guidance molecules  <cit> , <cit> , but are now known to also mediate apoptosis, cell migration, immune response, organogenesis, tumour suppression and promotion, and vasculature development  <cit> – <cit> . sema3s affect at least some aspects of the development of the visual system of rodents  <cit> , <cit> , from where much of our knowledge of molecular and activity-driven influences on mammalian visual system development has come  <cit> , <cit> .

in summary, while we understand much about the timing of developmental events in the mammalian visual system, investigation of a potential role for the sema3s in these events would benefit from knowledge about the timing of expression of sema3s and their receptors during visual system maturation. we sought to address this gap in our knowledge by building on a previous study from our laboratory  <cit> , focusing on sema3s known to be expressed in rgcs and extending the work to include a greater number of receptors as well as analysis of a major central target for those rgcs, the superior colliculus . to that end, we quantified transcript expression in the rat retina and sc over a range of embryonic  and postnatal  developmental time points  which were chosen to correspond to previously established developmental epochs such as the timing of cell birth, migration, naturally occurring cell death, axonal and dendritic growth, and synaptogenesis . we also investigated the hypothesis that sema <dig> ligands in the sc can influence rgc axon guidance using an in vitro growth cone collapse assay on isolated rgcs from a developmental stage when they would be growing into and within the sc in vivo.

changes in class  <dig> semaphorins and their receptor components during rat retinal development
expression levels in the retina could be separated into three qualitative groups: relatively high expression of sema3f and plxna2; moderate expression of nrp <dig> and plxna1; and relatively low expression of the rest . there were statistically significant changes in the level of expression of all sema <dig> rnas in the retina, while of the receptors only nrp <dig>  plxna <dig>  plxna <dig>  and plxna4a showed statistically significant changes .

relative to other time points, sema3a transcript expression levels were significantly increased at p <dig> and in the adult. similar to sema3a, sema3b transcript expression was relatively stable during retinal development until p <dig>  at which time there was increased expression that was maintained into adulthood. sema3c rna expression was also relatively steady through to p <dig>  increasing significantly through to p <dig>  and remaining at that level into the adult. sema3e rna levels appeared to increase gradually with retinal maturation and were significantly higher than e16-p <dig> levels at p <dig> and in adult rats. sema3f transcription was temporarily greater at p <dig> and then increased again at p <dig> and beyond. nrp <dig> rna expression gradually increased throughout retina maturation, levels at p <dig> and beyond being significantly greater than in embryos. plxna <dig> and plxna <dig> showed nearly identical patterns of altered transcript expression during development, both peaking significantly at the time of birth . plxna4a rna levels peaked later at p <dig>  but also again in the adult.

many of the significant peaks in transcript expression occurred after the main developmental epochs. however, the changes that were quantified in the retina before p <dig> occurred during periods of rgc apoptosis, and synapse generation and maturation.

changes in class  <dig> semaphorins and their receptor components during development of the rat superior colliculus
there were four qualitative groups of transcript expression levels in the sc: plxna <dig> having the highest; followed by sema3f, nrp <dig>  and nrp2; then sema3b, sema3c and plxna3; and lower amounts for the remainder . with the exception of l1cam, all genes of interest changed expression significantly during sc maturation.

sema3a rna levels were highly variable at e <dig> , peaked at e <dig>  and a decline with increasing postnatal age. the expression profile of sema3b differed from other transcripts; there was large biological variation at many time points, with cvs greater than 100%, and four apparent peaks in expression, only one of which reached significance . sema3c transcript expression peaked at e <dig> and p <dig>  before falling to adult levels by around p <dig>  in contrast to the other sema3s, sema3e transcript levels increased steadily from e <dig> to p <dig>  before a decrease at p <dig>  then again increased in the adult. sema3f expression was highest at e <dig> and e <dig>  with rna levels lower at birth and remaining at those reduced levels during postnatal development. there was relatively high biological variation in expression levels of nrp <dig>  nrp <dig> and all plexinas at e <dig> and e <dig>  compared to other time-points. nrp <dig> rna expression peaked at e <dig> then decreased steadily to p <dig> at levels that were maintained into the adult. nrp <dig> transcript levels peaked at e <dig> before falling steadily to e <dig> levels at p <dig> and beyond. plxna <dig> rna expression also peaked at e <dig>  a pattern that was repeated for the remaining three plexina rnas, all of which had significantly decreased rna expression by p <dig> and p <dig> that remained at low levels into adulthood.

the patterns of expression of sema3s in the developing sc were substantially different from those seen in the retina, with peak expression occurring around or before birth. temporally, these changes in transcript expression occurred during the period of sc neurogenesis, synapse generation and maturation, and innervation of the sc by extrinsic afferents including those from the retina and visual cortex.

expression of plxna <dig> in the neonatal retina
our qpcr data showed that peak plxna <dig> rna expression in the retina occurred during the period of peak rgc apoptosis . while rat retinal cells expressing the sema <dig> receptor components nrp <dig>  nrp <dig>  plxna <dig> and plxna <dig> have previously been identified using ish  <cit>  there has been no such characterisation for plxna <dig>  we used ish to examine the cellular location of plxna <dig> transcripts in p <dig> and p <dig> rat retinas  and found that plxna <dig> rna was clearly expressed in the ganglion cell layer at both these ages, with transcript expression overlapping βiii-tubulin  immunostaining. this is in agreement with previously published data in the mouse retina  <cit> . qualitatively, changes in the level of plxna <dig> expression in our ish data are consistent with the reduction in expression between p <dig> and p <dig> in our qpcr material.

growth cone collapse assay for purified neonatal rgcs in vitro
it has been suggested that sema3s in the sc can assist in the guidance of ingrowing rgc axons  <cit> , and our data revealed increased expression of these ligands in the sc during this period . to further investigate the capability of sema3s to influence rgc axons as they grow into and within the sc we used a growth cone collapse assay to assess the capacity of developmentally appropriate rgcs to respond to sema <dig> proteins. recombinant sema <dig> proteins  in conditioned media were used to challenge immunopurified p1/p <dig> rgcs in vitro. these proteins were detected in the conditioned media by western blot against their artificial epitopes . detected bands for sema3a-gfp correspond to the approximately 130 kda and 90 kda bands reported previously  <cit> . sema3c-flag was detected at around 80 kda as expected, and also in a presumably processed form at around 70 kda. both sema3c-flag and sema3e-flag were detected in media at approximately 100 kda, which might represent glycosylated forms of the proteins. sema3f-ap was detected at 150 kda, in line with expectations. transfected cells were analysed in culture by epifluorescence and immunocytochemistry and were positive for recombinant proteins while appropriate controls were negative .

growth cones were visible as f-actin positive extensions from the ends of βiii-tubulin positive neurites. typically uncollapsed growth cones displayed the common ‘hand like’ morphology, and collapsed growth cones appeared as thin stumps. growth cones were counted only at the end of neurites, even when significant growth cone-like processes were observed along the shaft of a neurite, as these lateral extensions can occur in response to the collapse of the leading growth cone  <cit> . examples of collapsed versus uncollapsed growth cones are illustrated in figure  <dig>  cultures treated with conditioned media containing any of the sema3s had significantly higher percentages of collapsed growth cones, with the average percentage of the two replicates and statistical significance level presented in figure 7a. our data demonstrate that neonatal rat rgcs are competent to respond to sema3a, sema3c, sema3e, and sema3f proteins at a developmental time point during which their axons are entering into and growing within the sc in vivo <cit> , <cit> , <cit> .

discussion
we found statistically significant changes in gene expression of sema3s and their co-receptors during maturation of the rat retina and sc. these changes differed in degree and time-course between the retina and sc so were not due to generalised or non-specific systemic changes. it is likely that the observed tissue-specific changes in expression reflect the biological roles of these molecules and are in some way related to the development and maturation of each structure  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . while our data cannot localise these changes in expression to distinct cell populations, previous work in the retina suggests that the transcripts studied are heavily expressed in rat rgcs  <cit> . importantly we also showed that neonatal rat rgcs are competent to respond to sema3s at a developmental time point when their axons are encountering the sema3s in the sc. we are wary of over-analysing temporal association data, but to help place our results in context we briefly discuss our data below with respect to known developmental processes .

class  <dig> semaphorins and morphogenesis of the retina and superior colliculus
sema5s and sema6s are known to mediate lamination of the mouse retina, signalling through plxna <dig>  plxna <dig> and plxna <dig> <cit> – <cit> . in addition, sema3s guide cells as they differentiate and migrate within cns tissues such as the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , and presumably they are able diffuse through tissues like other guidance cues in the mammalian visual system such as the ephs and netrin. is the expression of sema3s also involved in morphogenesis of the rat retina and sc? retinal neurogenesis occurs from e10/e <dig> through to the second postnatal week  <cit> , and while there is expression of all sema3s and their receptors and co-receptors during much of this period, expression levels are for the most part relatively low. rod photoreceptor generation peaks at p <dig>  as does transcript expression of sema3f, plxna <dig> and plxna <dig> rnas. however there appears to be very little sema3f transcript expression in the outer nuclear layer  at this age  <cit> , despite evidence of relatively high expression of sema3f rna in the onl of adult mice  <cit> .

on the other hand, rat sc neurogenesis occurs from e <dig> to e <dig>  <cit> , <cit>  and the sc has an adult like laminar structure at p <dig>  <cit> . sema3c and nrp <dig> rna expression displayed the same upwards then downwards sweep as neurogenesis in the sc: elevated at e <dig> and p <dig>  falling by p <dig>  similarly, sema3a, sema3b, and sema3f as well as nrp <dig> and all plexina co-receptors showed peak expressions at e <dig> that declined thereafter, coincidental with early cytoarchitectural patterning of the sc. these data therefore suggest that the sema3s might play a role in patterning the sc, but not the retina.

class  <dig> semaphorins and retinal ganglion cell apoptosis
sema3s, specifically sema3a and sema3f, have been implicated in apoptosis of neurons including rgcs  <cit> – <cit> . during retinal development, rgc apoptosis is predominantly perinatal  <cit> – <cit>  and we observed three genes that had clear peaks in retinal rna expression at p0: sema3f, plxna <dig>  and plxna <dig>  interestingly, plxna <dig> and plxna <dig> are co-receptors for sema3f and sema3a <cit> , and plxna <dig> has been shown to be directly involved in sema3a mediated cell death  <cit> . sema3a, sema3f, and plxna <dig> are expressed in neonatal rat rgcs  <cit> , and we here show that in the rat plxna <dig> rna is predominantly expressed in the retinal ganglion cell layer  at p <dig> . importantly we also showed that p1/p <dig> rat rgcs were responsive to both sema3a and sema3f . our data provide further suggestive evidence that the sema3s may influence rgc apoptosis.

class  <dig> semaphorin expression during the period of synapse generation and maturation in retina and superior colliculus
sema3s are also involved in terminal axon branching, synaptogenesis, pruning of terminal arbors, regulation of synaptic plasticity, and maturation of dendrites  <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . synaptogenesis in the rat retina starts around p <dig> and is ongoing at p <dig>  <cit> , <cit> – <cit> , when transcripts for sema3c and sema3e both become more abundant. conversely, sema3b and sema3f rnas increased after completion of retinal synaptogenesis   <cit> . the maintained relatively high transcript levels in the adult rat retina of sema3b, sema3c, sema3e, and sema3f might indicate a role in regulating synaptic plasticity in the mature retina. it has been reported that plxna <dig>  plxna <dig>  and plxna <dig> are important for proper lamination of the inner plexiform layer  of the mouse retina, with mrna expressed in amacrine cells and protein heavily expressed in the ipl  <cit> – <cit> . we see no clear signal supporting this finding in the rat retina, although this may be a consequence of analysing global rather than cellular expression. in the sc, the majority of synaptogenesis is postnatal  <cit> – <cit> , and sema3e rna expression in the sc peaks during the period when many synapses are being formed  suggesting a role for this molecule in sc synaptogenesis.

effect of sema3s on guiding rgc and other axons into and within the superior colliculus
rgc axons enter the rat sc between e <dig> and p5/p <dig>  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , and previous results suggest that sema3f may contribute in helping to guide these axons to their correct retinotopic targets  <cit> . furthermore, the sema <dig> co-receptor l1cam is required for correct mapping of retinal axons in the mouse  <cit> , <cit> . previous data reveal that during development of the mouse sc at least some of the retino-tectal afferent fibres are positive for nrp <dig>  nrp <dig>  and l1cam <cit> – <cit> , and p <dig> mouse rgc axons express the receptors nrp <dig> and plxna <dig> <cit> . while previous studies have shown responsiveness of some rodent rgcs to some sema3s  <cit> , these were not conducted at a developmental time point where the rgc axons are growing into and within their sema <dig> expressing targets  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . here we show for the first time that rat p1/p <dig> rgcs are capable of responding to exogenous sema <dig> proteins at an age when many of these neurons are encountering these sema3s as they grow axons into and within the sc.  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . our data show that almost all these sema3s, bar sema3e, had peak expression levels in the sc during this period of retinal afferent ingrowth, but that sema3c and sema3f had around tenfold higher expression compared to sema3a and sema3e. this difference in rna expression levels might indicate that if these molecules are having an effect then the more likely candidates are sema3c and sema3f. however, some caution must be used when extrapolating levels of rna expression to physiological significance; l1cam, plxna <dig> and plxna4a all had relatively low expression in the retina despite their known effects in patterning the retina  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . nevertheless, our data do support the suggestion that sema3f may play a role in the formation of the retinotopic map in the mammalian sc  <cit> .

sema3s have also previously been shown to influence the pattern of long-distance cortico-tectal projections  <cit> . rat visual cortical axons reach the sc at about p <dig>  with marked ingrowth between p <dig> and p <dig>  and then final maturation between p12-p <dig>  <cit> . our data show elevated sema3e expression during this period of ingrowth and maturation of cortical fibers in the sc, suggesting that sema3e might influence the development of corticotectal projections.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the analysis of the sema3s and their co-receptors in the developing rat visual system revealed a number of new and potentially important findings. in the retina, mrna expression levels changed for all sema3s examined and there were age-specific changes in nrp <dig>  plxna <dig>  plxna <dig>  and plxna4a mrna expression. in the sc there were also maturational changes in transcript levels for all sema3s, neuropilins, and plexinas, although the time-course of these changes differed markedly from those seen in the retina. these developmental changes were associated with periods of rgc apoptosis; neurogenesis in the sc; synapse generation, maturation, and plasticity in the retina and sc; and innervation by retino- and cortico-tectal axons in the sc. importantly, and consistent with a broad role for the sema <dig> family in the maturing visual system, purified p1/p <dig> rgcs were sensitive to sema3a, sema3c, sema3e, and sema3f mediated growth cone collapse in vitro. these new data, providing a framework for future studies aimed at elucidating such roles of the sema3s. these new data describing the overall temporal regulation of sema <dig> expression in the rat retina and sc highlight maturational events that might be influenced by sema3s, providing a platform for further work characterising the functional impact of these proteins on mammalian visual system development.
