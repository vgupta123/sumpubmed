BACKGROUND
recombineering  is a relatively recently described technique of homologous recombination -based genetic engineering performed within an e. coli host and mediated by transient expression of phage-encoded recombinases . both lambda red  <cit>  and the rec e/t  <cit>  recombinase systems have been developed into recombineering tools for transient, controlled expression of the respective recombinase activities. whilst recombineering can be used to modify the host chromosome the technique is more commonly applied to episomal replicons including low-copy-number bacs or fosmids and intermediate and multicopy plasmids. modifications are targeted and precise and can range from single base-pair deletions or insertions to the addition or deletion of sequences in the kilobase-pair range. bacteria containing the target are transformed with linear, double- or single-stranded, donor dna molecules bearing the desired sequence changes. these donor molecules are generated, as pcr-amplicons, restriction fragments or oligonucleotides, that contain, at each end, appropriate regions of homology to the circular target. in contrast to reca-mediated genetic engineering only short  homologies are required to mediate efficient hr between donor and target molecules. these "homology arms" can be built easily into a donor by pcr. recombineering is particularly useful when manipulating larger target molecules, such as bacs or fosmids, which, because of their size, will likely lack the required range of unique and appropriately positioned restriction enzyme sites necessary to achieve subtle modifications. recombineering is gaining wider acceptance as a genetic engineering tool and may be viewed as a viable alternative to more traditional restriction enzyme/ligase-based approaches particularly when modifying large target molecules.

the nematode c. elegans is a genetically tractable model animal that, since its initial introduction  <cit> , has become the experimental system of choice for many laboratories. determining the expression pattern for a gene-of-interest  by analysing β-galactosidase or fluorescent protein reporter expression in c. elegans transformed with a goi::reporter fusion gene is a commonly performed procedure. in a so-called transcriptional reporter gene fusion the expression of the reporter protein alone is driven by dna fragments known, or presumed, to contain all or part of the goi's promoter. in c. elegans this usually comprises 1- <dig> kb from immediately 5' of the translational start codon. such constructions will, by definition, exclude any regulatory elements that lie outside the assayed genomic dna fragment. in contrast, in a translational reporter gene fusion the reporter gene is fused, in-frame, to all, or part, of the goi's protein coding region to encode a fusion protein. such a translational reporter gene fusion would, ideally, contain not only all in the immediate vicinity of the goi's protein coding region but also significant stretches of 5' and 3' flanking dna, and so include more distantly located regulatory elements.

as discussed, recombineering is ideal for engineering large targets and a number of protocols designed to generate translational-style reporter gene fusions directly from c. elegans genomic clones have been described  <cit> . additionally, we  <cit> , and others  <cit> , have combined recombineering with counter-selection to enable the reporter sequence to be inserted seamlessly into the target. such counter-selection strategies are, however, limited to fosmid or other low-copy-number vector targets because the relative inefficiency of the recombineering method makes it difficult otherwise to select negatively for desired recombinants. the c. elegans genome is covered extensively with genomic clones from a library constructed in the copy-number-inducible fosmid vector pcc1fos . in addition to the f factor system, that maintains pcc1fos-based clones at 1- <dig> copies per chromosome, pcc1fos also contains an oriv replication origin. when propagated in a suitable host strain, e.g. epi <dig> , that carries trfa encoding the associated replication protein trfa, the oriv replication origin allows copy-number to be induced to approximately 50- <dig> copies per host chromosome. if trfa transcription is tightly controlled, for example by the l-arabinose-regulated arac-pbad system, then oriv-equipped fosmid copy-number is only increased "on-command" when high yields of good-quality dna need to be isolated for downstream events  <cit> .

the counter-selection protocol applied by us  <cit>  utilises e. coli host strains, e.g. el <dig> and el <dig>  <cit>  and derivatives there from, that provide recombineering capacity via a chromosomally integrated defective lambda prophage. the prophage contains the red recombinase genes arranged in their natural context and tightly regulated by the temperature-sensitive ci <dig> repressor  <cit> . although recombinase functions can be supplied  via plasmids the tighter control and coordinated expression of the integrated prophage approach is considered more efficient and controllable. our counter-selection approach  <cit>  utilizes a dicistronic counter-selection cassette , containing the respective positive and negative markers teta and rpsl driven by the hypo-osmotically up-regulated ompf promoter to provide stringent positive and negative selection for single-copy vectors  <cit> . the rt-cassette, inserted at the target site by an initial recombineering step using positive selection for recombinants, is replaced with the desired sequence in a second round of recombineering using negative selection. positive selection is provided by teta conferring tetracycline  resistance  whereas, when expressed in a rpsl- host, the wild-type rpsl+ gene provides the negative marker. mutations in the chromosomal rpsl, that encodes the ribosomal protein s <dig>  confers streptomycin , resistance . when both mutant and wild-type rpsl alleles are co-expressed a dominant sm sensitive  phenotype results. because el <dig> and el <dig> are rpsl- and thus smr, the introduction, via the rt-cassette, of a rpsl+ allele confers sms. consequently, non-recombinants following the second recombineering step will remain sms and are selected against whereas desired recombinants are smr revertants.

whilst efficient in mediating recombineering, a strain such as el <dig> does not permit copy-number induction of resident oriv-equipped clones. thus, our present protocol requires an additional fosmid dna isolation step and transformation into a trfa-producing strain to enable transient copy-number induction. in order to combine recombineering and copy-number induction in a single strain we have retrofitted the chromosome of el <dig> with a copy of trfa under control of the arac-pbad regulatory system. the resulting strain, mw <dig>  enables recombineering and copy-number induction to be performed in a single host with significant improvements in speed and productivity. we have used mw <dig> successfully to create a number of reporter gene fusions in pcc1fos-based genomic clones. we describe here construction details for mw <dig> and demonstrate its use in supporting controlled copy-number induction of oriv-equipped fosmid and bac genomic clones. in addition, we also illustrate its use in recombineering in the construction of a pcc1fos-based translational gfp reporter gene fusion for the c. elegans transcription factor gene ceh- <dig> 

RESULTS
the "on-command" oriv/trfa induction system  <cit>  enables the copy-number of large genomic dna clones, based in vectors such as bacs or fosmids, to be either maintained at 1- <dig> copies per cell or be increased transiently to 50- <dig> copies per cell. low copy-number ensures clone stability while high copy-number provides for increased yields and improved dna purity at dna isolation. controlled copy-number regulation requires the vector be equipped with the oriv replication origin and be propagated in a suitable e. coli host that carries an inducible copy of the trfa gene encoding the trans-acting replication protein trfa. suitable vectors, e.g. pcc1bac or pcc1fos, and trfa-containing strains, e.g. epi <dig>  are available commercially . we have described previously  <cit>  recombineering protocols designed to generate large translational-style reporter gene fusions directly in c. elegans genomic clones from a pcc1fos-based genomic dna library. however, these protocols require that, following clone engineering in a recombineering strain, final recombinants are moved back into epi <dig>  the original library host strain, for subsequent copy-number induction and isolation of fosmid dna. to eliminate this step we utilised our counter-selection recombineering strategy to replace seamlessly the chromosomal pbad-driven cre in the recombineering strain el <dig>  <cit>  with a copy of trfa  to generate strain mw <dig>  Φ80dlacz m <dig> Δlacx <dig> deor reca <dig> enda <dig> arad <dig> Δ  <dig> galu galk rspl nupg ). mw <dig> enables both recombineering and copy-number induction to be performed in the same host. the trfa dna, pcr-amplified from epi <dig>  encodes the full-length  trfa protein and contains the g254d "copy-up" mutation demonstrated to increase significantly copy-number induction  <cit> .

to investigate whether mw <dig> would support copy-number induction of oriv-equipped clones we compared copy-number induction in epi <dig> and mw <dig> for three pcc1fos-based clones, the final recombineered c. elegans gene fusion reporter ful#sb <dig>  plus two native genomic clones, and three pcc1bac-based genomic clones from a library constructed with lates calcarifer  genomic dna . dnas, isolated from equal numbers of cells from epi <dig> or mw <dig> cultures that were either non-induced for copy-number or had received l-arabinose to drive trfa expression and thus induce copy-number, were restricted and electrophoresed. copy-numbers of pcc1fos- and pcc1bac-based clones were induced in both epi <dig> and mw <dig> by an approximately equal extent . for each clone, careful visual comparison between the ethidium bromide-stained restriction fragments of dna isolated from the control culture with those of a 2-fold serial dilution of the equivalent fragments of dna isolated from the induced culture enabled fold-induction to be estimated for both strains. such examination indicates that the copy-numbers of all three pcc1fos-based clones were induced from 50-60-fold in both the commercial epi <dig> strain and mw <dig>  e.g. in fig. 2a, gels i, ii and iii, compare lane  <dig>  containing the restriction digest, diluted 1/ <dig>  from induced epi <dig>  with lane  <dig>  containing the undiluted restriction digest from non-induced epi <dig>  and lanes  <dig> and  <dig> containing, respectively, the equivalent restriction digest dilutions for induced and non-induced mw <dig>  although, for the three pcc1bac-based clones, there was some slight variation in copy-number induction between clones and strains, visual examination of fig. 2b indicates that, for each bac clone, copy-number was increased approximately 15-20-fold, e.g. compare lane  <dig>  containing the 1/16-diluted restriction digest from induced epi <dig>  with lane  <dig>  containing the undiluted restriction digest from non-induced epi <dig>  and lanes  <dig> and  <dig> containing the equivalent dilutions for induced and non-induced mw <dig>  respectively.

we have now used mw <dig> in a number of experiments in which both recombineering and copy-number induction were performed. one typical procedure involved inserting a gfp reporter at the end of the protein coding region of the c. elegans ceh- <dig> gene within a pcc1fos-based genomic dna clone . the original clone contained the entire ceh- <dig> locus plus substantial flanking sequences that would likely include more distantly located regulatory elements . following successful gfp insertion  direct induction of the resulting clone copy-number provided, from a single overnight miniculture, quantities of high-quality dna sufficient for numerous c. elegans transformations . the resulting expression of gfp in vb motorneurons, which innervate ventral body muscles and are involved in forward locomotion, was in accordance with previous investigations of ceh- <dig> gene expression   <cit> .

the coupled pcc1fos-based genomic clone recombineering and copy-number induction described here have validated the use of mw <dig> as a convenient host strain in which to perform both recombineering-based genetic engineering and copy-number induction. as there is some evidence for very low levels of "leaky" cre expression in el <dig>  <cit>  we were concerned initially that if trfa expression was similarly leaky in mw <dig> this may result in pcc1fos-based clone copy-number being increased above its normal range of 1- <dig> copies per cell with knock-on effects for clone stability and/or recombineering efficiency. however, restriction enzyme digestion of fosmid and bac clones isolated from mw <dig> minicultures  indicated these clones were stably propagated in this strain. in addition to the clone modification described here, mw <dig> has been used successfully to perform recombineering on more than twenty additional pcc1fos-based c. elegans genomic clones and there is no evidence that recombination efficiency differs from the parental strain el <dig>  estimates of such efficiency  ×  <dig> indicate a range of approx.  <dig> - <dig> % for both el <dig> and mw <dig> 

the only experimental proviso on the use of mw <dig> is that incubation temperatures must not exceed 32°c at any time except during the brief heat-shock needed to de-repress transcription of the red gene cluster. this is not a significant inconvenience as culture growth rates are slowed only marginally. as we retrofitted strain el <dig>  mw <dig> cannot be used for recombineering with a galk counter-selection cassette  <cit>  nor can it be used to excise loxp-flanked sequences as the chromosomal copy of cre is now replaced with trfa. we believe mw <dig>  available from the non-profit plasmid repository addgene, will prove useful to a number of labs using recombineering to modify oriv-equipped clones. for clones lacking an oriv this sequence can be easily retrofitted into the clone either by recombineering or by standard genetic engineering techniques or, and perhaps more straightforwardly, via random tn <dig> transposon-mediated insertion  <cit>  .

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the construction of a new e. coli strain, mw <dig>  retrofitted with a pbad-driven copy of trfa encoding the trans-activating replication protein trfa. use of mw <dig> permits researchers to perform both lambda red-mediated recombineering and subsequent copy-number induction of recombinant dnas, if these are equipped with oriv, in a single host thereby negating the requirement for additional clone isolation and transformation steps. when large number of clones are being modified by recombineering this can translate into significant time saving.
