BACKGROUND
the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system maintains normal cellular function by eliminating aberrant proteins in response to extracellular stimuli. proteasome inhibition has also emerged as part of adjuvant therapy to increase sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. recently, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib  was approved by the fda for treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. mechanisms underlying proteasome inhibition-mediated cell death are not well understood.

focal adhesion protein p130cas  is a multi-domain docking protein, with an n-terminal sh <dig> domain, a central "substrate domain" consisting of multiple sh2-domain binding motifs , and a "src-binding domain" near the c-terminus  <cit> . following integrin activation or growth factor stimulation, cas interacts with several protein partners and regulates cellular events, such as migration, proliferation, and survival  <cit> . most notably, the adaptor protein crk is a primary docking partner and its association with phosphorylated cas induces rac-dependent cell migration and promotes tumor cell invasion  <cit> . in addition to regulating cell motility, cas can also relay survival signals from the extracellular matrix to the nucleus  <cit> . it has been reported that cas confers resistance to anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin and tamoxifen via activation of signaling pathways mediated by various kinases, including src, egfr, akt and erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . ta et al. observed that human breast cancer cell lines demonstrate varying sensitivity to doxorubicin, possibly due to variable expression levels of cas  <cit> . in fact, cas expression is considered a useful prognostic marker for patients with primary or metastatic breast cancer  <cit> . signaling via the cas/crk complex also promotes cell survival via activation of erk and rac pathways  <cit> , and it has been reported that uncoupling of cas and crk is required for abl-mediated apoptosis to take place  <cit> .

while cas frequently appears to signal pro-survival, increasingly literature demonstrates that the c-terminal domain of cas that is released by proteolysis may play an opposing role. for example, etoposide treatment of hela cells elicits apoptosis accompanied by cas cleavage, yielding a c-terminal  <dig> kd fragment . specifically, cas exhibits cleavage first at site asp <dig> yielding a c-terminal  <dig> kd product. subsequent cleavage of this fragment at asp <dig> results in the generation of the c-terminal  <dig> kd fragment during etoposide-induced apoptosis, and replacement of asp <dig> with a glutamic acid residue blocks the  <dig> kd cas-ct production in this system  <cit> . notably, the  <dig> kd fragment has been found to physically interact with the transcription factor e2a in the nucleus and repress its activity, preventing e-box binding to e2a and thus inhibiting e2a-mediated p21waf1/cip <dig> transcription and promoting apoptosis  <cit> . similar observations have been reported on the death-promoting ability of another cas family member, human enhancer of filamentation , which requires generation of a c-terminal  <dig> kd fragment  <cit> .

several additional pro-apoptotic stimuli, such as detachment-induced cell death , uv irradiation and treatment with anticancer drugs, can induce cas cleavage as well  <cit> . both caspase and calpain inhibitors can each partially block cas cleavage, but cleavage is not completely inhibited when these two inhibitors are combined  <cit> , suggesting that additional mechanisms are involved in cas cleavage. this notion is supported by a study demonstrating that smad <dig> interacts with hef <dig> and mediates its cleavage upon tgf-β stimulation  <cit> . in this case, hef <dig> degradation was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin but not by the caspase inhibitor z-vad.

here, we used several different cell death assays to show that cas is crucial for mediating cell death that takes place upon proteasome inhibition. we found that proteasome inhibition induces cell death in cells that express cas, but not in those that lack cas expression. interestingly, inhibition of autophagy in cas -/- mefs enhanced proteasome inhibition-induced cell death in these cells. we also demonstrate that accumulated cas-ct plays only a minor role in mg132-induced cell death. thus, our studies uncover a novel role for cas in mediating proteasome inhibition-induced cell death, and suggest that cas may do so, at least partially, by inhibiting autophagy. intriguingly, we found that reduced levels of cas offer protection against cell death induced by the dna-damaging agent doxorubicin, too, and this protection again coincides with induction of autophagy. combined with the findings by ta et al. noting that overexpression of cas results in chemoresistance  <cit> , our results suggest that cas may have a universal yet complex regulatory role in cell death signaling in response to multiple different stimuli, perhaps determined by cas gene/protein dosage.

RESULTS
cas mediates proteasome inhibition-induced cell death
cas has been shown to regulate cell death pathways in response to various anticancer agents, and we, therefore, decided to examine its potential role in proteasome inhibition-mediated cell death. to determine the role of cas in proteasome inhibition-induced cell death, cas -/- mefs that had been stably transfected with either empty vector ), or full-length wild-type cas , were treated with proteasome inhibitors mg <dig> or bortezomib. as expected, mg <dig> or bortezomib-treated cas-fl cells became round and detached under phase-contrast microscope, indicative of proteasome inhibition-induced cell death. surprisingly, cas-/-  cells were found to be resistant to proteasome inhibitor-induced cell death . to further compare the sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors of cas-/-  and cas-fl cells, we undertook mts assay measurements and found that both mg <dig> and bortezomib effectively killed wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts  and cas-fl mefs in a dose-dependent fashion, while cas-/-  cells were relatively resistant to these compounds . to control for differences related to selection of stably transfected clonal cell lines, we also assayed non-transfected primary cas-/- mefs and observed effects similar to cas-/-  cells following treatment with various concentrations of mg <dig> or bortezomib . importantly, proteasome activity assay demonstrated that proteasome activity is equally inhibited in cas-/- and cas-fl cells in response to mg <dig> treatment. as such, differences in drug update or metabolism do not appear to contribute to the cell survival differences observed in the two cell types .

to confirm the results observed in mefs, we used shrnas to specifically knock-down cas expression in human 293t and hela cells. as shown in figure 1c, d, two independent cas shrnas reduced cas expression by about 65% in the two cell lines. concomitant with this, about 50% reduction  was observed in mg132-induced cell death, when cas shrna-transfected 293t cells were compared to mock-transfected cells or to cells transfected with empty vector or control shrna . likewise, bortezomib-induced cell death was reduced by about 45% in cas shrna-transfected 293t cells  . similarly, knock-down of cas by shrna reduced mg132-induced cell death by about 40%  in hela cells . thus, these results suggest that proteasome inhibition-induced cell death takes place in cas-dependent manner in different cell lines.

our preliminary studies demonstrated that cas levels may control cellular responsiveness to other apoptotic stimuli, too. while ta et al. have found that overexpression of cas confers resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cells  <cit> , we found that complete lack of cas expression also reduces cellular responsiveness to doxorubicin, although not to the same extent than cellular responsiveness to proteasome inhibitors. thus, about 37% reduction  was observed in  <dig>  μm doxorubicin-induced cell death, when cas-/-  cells were compared to cas-fl cells . these preliminary results suggest that the role of cas in drug resistance may be more universal, but also more complicated than previously anticipated, and suggest the intriguing possibility that gene and protein dosage may be emerging as a major mechanism to control distinct biological events in case of cas .

mg132-induced cell death is due to apoptosis
proteasome inhibition reportedly induces cell death by activating cell type-dependent signaling pathways. to determine pathways underlying cell death in mg132-treated mefs, we treated cas-fl and wt mefs with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk and observed that the treatment largely prevented mg132-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner , suggesting that caspase-mediated apoptosis causes mg132-induced cell death in this system. an elisa assay measuring nuclear dna fragmentation as an indication of apoptosis demonstrated that detectable apoptosis takes place within  <dig> hours in mg132-treated cas-fl cells, and that the observed apoptosis was at maximal levels  <dig> hours post-treatment . using the same assay, we also observed that both  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm mg <dig> could induce apoptosis in both cas-fl and wt mefs, but not in cas-/-  cells, indicating that mg132-elicited cell apoptosis requires cas expression .

we next treated cas-fl cells with different concentrations of z-vad-fmk to examine its effect on mg132- and bortezomib-mediated apoptosis. as shown in figure 2d,  <dig> μm z-vad-fmk had little effect on apoptosis,  <dig> μm z-vad-fmk blocked it by  <dig> to 90%, and  <dig> and  <dig> μm z-vad-fmk completely prevented mg132- and bortezomib-induced apoptosis. we additionally evaluated cell viability using a live-dead cell staining assay, and found that a portion of mg132-treated cas-fl cells were ethidium homodimer positive indicative of cell death, which was not observed in the presence of z-vad-fmk . this further supports the notion that proteasome inhibition-induced cell death in cas-expressing cells is due to caspase-mediated apoptosis.

caspase signaling underlies mg132-induced apoptosis of mefs
our data above indicate that the caspases likely mediate mg132-induced mef cell death, and we, therefore, analyzed caspase activation in mefs by immunoblot analysis. as shown in figure 3a,  <dig> μm mg <dig> elicited robust parp cleavage in both cas-fl and wt mefs, while it had little effect on cas-/-  cells . consistently, parp cleavage was weakly detected in cas-fl cells  <dig> hours after mg <dig> treatment, and the peak response occurred around  <dig> hours post-treatment . cleavage of "effector" caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  and "initiator" caspase- <dig> was readily detected in both mg132-treated cas-fl and wt mefs but not in cas-/-  cells . mg <dig> concentration as high as  <dig> μm did not induce cleavage of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> in cas-/-  cells. we confirmed that caspases-3/ <dig> were activated by mg <dig> in cas-fl and wt mefs using a luciferase-based luminescence assay, and this activation was completely blocked by z-vad-fmk .

release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol stimulates formation of the apoptosome to activate caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  to determine whether mitochondrial alteration occurs in mg132-treated mefs, we analyzed their cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions by immunoblotting. mg <dig> treatment significantly increased cytosolic cytochrome c levels in both cas-fl and wt mefs but not in cas-/-  cells, suggesting that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was involved in mg132-induced, cas-dependent apoptosis . since caspase- <dig> also mediates apoptosis and functions upstream of "effector" caspases, we undertook a luminescence-based caspase- <dig> activation assay and found that caspase- <dig> activation was dramatically induced in mg132-treated cas-fl cells, but only weakly induced in cas-/-  cells . treatment with the caspase-8-specific inhibitor z-ietd-fmk significantly protected cas-fl mefs from mg132-induced death in mts assays, suggesting caspase- <dig> involvement in this process . furthermore, when caspase- <dig> expression was reduced by shrna in hela cells, these cells became resistant to both mg <dig> and bortezomib as shown in the mts assay in figure 3g. taken together, our studies demonstrate activation of the caspase cascade, including activation of the apical caspase- <dig>  upon mg132-treatment in cas-expressing cells, but not in cells that are deficient of cas.

mg <dig> induces cas cleavage in apoptotic cells
previous studies have reported that several focal adhesion proteins, including fak, paxillin and cas, undergo cleavage  during cellular apoptosis  <cit> . here, we found that cas cleavage takes place in cas-fl cells and wt mefs upon mg <dig> treatment, yielding multiple fragments including the cas-ct fragment . time-course analysis showed that this fragment was detectable  <dig> hours after mg <dig> treatment in cas-fl mefs, markedly increased thereafter, and reached maximal levels at  <dig> hours post-treatment , in concordance with the patterns of parp cleavage and cell apoptosis . overall, these observations suggest a positive correlation between cas cleavage, caspase activation and cellular apoptosis.

since z-vad-fmk prevents mg132-induced cell death , we next investigated its effect on cas cleavage. as shown in figure 4c , z-vad-fmk did not alter the generation nor accumulation of cas-ct seen in cas-fl mefs treated with mg <dig>  suggesting that caspase inhibition alone is not sufficient to prevent cas-ct generation and accumulation in proteasome-inhibited cells. in control experiments, treatment with staurosporine, a potent inducer of apoptosis, caused severe cell death in cas-fl cells, resulting in significant degradation of the full-length cas protein. interestingly, cas-ct was hardly detected in these cells, and levels of full-length cas were greatly reduced . in the presence of mg <dig>  however, proteasome-mediated cas degradation was prevented and subsequently more intact full-length cas and cas-ct were detected in staurosporine-treated cells . these data combined indicate that both intact cas and cas fragments are subject to proteasomal degradation during apoptosis  and that upon proteasome inhibition, cas and cas fragments  appear to accumulate in cells.

as noted in the introduction, cas cleavage at sites asp <dig> and asp <dig> precedes the generation of the  <dig> kd cas-ct fragment during etoposide-induced apoptosis  <cit> . to determine the putative functional role of cas-ct in mg132-induced cell death, we stably expressed wt cas or cas mutants containing point mutations in either one or both codons at those two sites  in cas-/- mefs. we then compared mg132-induced signaling events in these transfected mefs. in agreement with a previous report  <cit> , we found that the cleavage of the p130cas-d416e mutant in apoptotic cells still took place, which resulted in increased levels of cas-ct upon mg <dig> treatment. both the d748e mutant and the d416/748e double mutant were resistant to such cleavage, and no cas-ct generation was detected in cells expressing these mutants following mg <dig> treatment . expression of both single and double cas mutant proteins, as well as of wt cas, significantly increased mg132-induced cleavage of parp and caspase- <dig> in cas-/- mefs, indicating promotion of apoptosis . consistently, all the three cas mutants along with wt cas effectively mediated mg132-induced apoptosis, based on cell death elisa  and cell viability  assays.

of note, kim et al. have shown that p21waf1/cip <dig> downregulation is responsible for cas-ct-mediated apoptosis in etoposide-treated hela cells  <cit> . in our study, expression of full-length cas or of these cleavage-resistant mutants increased p21waf1/cip <dig> expression in both untreated and mg132-treated mef cells , rather, suggesting that p21waf1/cip <dig> downregulation does not underlie mg132-induced apoptosis in this cell type. all these results indicate that, unlike the requirement for cas-ct generation in etoposide-mediated apoptosis, generation of cas-ct is not necessary for cas to mediate mg132-induced cell death.

autophagy protects cas-/-  cells from mg132-induced apoptosis
autophagy can be induced by numerous cellular stresses, such as nutrition deprivation, hypoxia and proteasome inhibition. conversion of the mammalian protein lc3-i, the homologue of yeast atg <dig>  to the autophagosome-associated lc3-ii is a hallmark of autophagy  <cit> . when lc <dig> translocates from the cytosol to the autophagosomal membrane, lc3-ii staining goes from diffuse to punctate staining and the protein shows increased gel mobility after lipidation, which is commonly used in autophagy detection  <cit> . we observed dramatic upregulation of lc3-ii following mg <dig> or bortezomib treatment in cas-/-  cells compared to cas-fl mefs , suggesting that proteasome inhibition induces autophagy, but only in cells that lack cas. to support this notion, shrna-mediated knockdown of cas expression in mg132-treated 293t cells also elicited autophagy activation as evidenced by increased lc3-ii level in cas-shrna expressing cells, but not in control-transfected 293t cells where lc3-ii was only weakly detected . these biochemical observations were further confirmed by immunofluorescence studies, which showed that mg <dig> treatment induced punctate appearance of endogenous lc <dig> in cas-/-  cells, while lc <dig> remained diffusely distributed in mg132-treated cas-fl mefs .

diminished levels of the p <dig> protein represent another widely used marker for autophagy induction  <cit> . as shown in additional file  <dig>  we observed that mg <dig> treatment results in a reproducible and significant decline in p <dig> levels in mg132-treated cas -/-  cells compared to cas-fl cells, and in mg132-treated hela cells in which cas expression has been down-regulated by cas-specific shrnas, compared to control-shrna-transfected cells. finally, we found that doxorubicin treatment, similar to proteasome inhibitor treatment, results in a more profound induction of autophagy in cas -/-  cells compared to cas-fl cells, as measured by lc3-ii and p <dig> immunoblotting . taken together, enhanced cell survival in cas -/-  cells in the presence of mg <dig> and doxorubicin appears to correlate with increased levels of autophagy.

accumulation of lc3-ii could be a consequence of either enhanced autophagic flux, or be due to the inhibition of autophagic degradation of lc <dig> in mg132-treated cas-deficient cells. bafilomycin a <dig> , which is a specific inhibitor of vacuolar type h+-atpase and therefore prevents autophagy at a late stage by inhibiting fusion between autophagosome and lysosome, was utilized to assess the autophagic flux in mg132-treated cells. as shown in figure 5d, treatment with baf and mg <dig> significantly increased lc3-ii levels as compared to treatment with either mg <dig> or baf alone in cas-/- cells, suggesting that autophagic flux was indeed increased in cas-/- cells that had been treated with mg <dig>  in comparison, baf caused similar levels of lc3-ii accumulation in the presence and absence of mg <dig> in cas-fl cells .

it is known that autophagy can protect cells from apoptosis under some circumstances  <cit> . in a detailed time-course experiment, we found that induction of autophagy took place in cas-/-  cells as early as six hours post-mg <dig> treatment, while apoptosis was detected in cas-fl cells around eight to nine hours after mg <dig> treatment . this time-course data suggested that autophagy might play a protective role in mg132-treated cas-/-  cells and prevent subsequent apoptosis from taking place. both chemical and genetic approaches were undertaken to study this possibility. upon treatment of cas-/-  cells with chemical inhibitors of autophagy, such as chloroquine  or 3-methyladenine , mg132-induced parp cleavage was enhanced , suggesting that autophagy indeed blocks apoptosis in these cells. inhibition of autophagy had a more limited effect on cas-fl cell apoptosis, as evidenced by minimal changes in parp cleavage . apoptotic elisa assay revealed similar results, as inhibition of autophagy by 3-ma or chq significantly promoted apoptosis in mg132-treated cas-/-  mefs . in agreement with these results, the inhibitors significantly enhanced mg132-induced cell death in cas-/-  mefs but not in cas-fl cells, when cell viability assays were utilized as a read-out .

to further confirm these results, we used atg <dig> shrnas to block mg132-induced autophagy in cas-when autophagy was inhibited by these genetic means , increased parp and caspase- <dig> cleavage were detected in cas-/-  mefs treated with mg <dig> . consistent with this, blockade of autophagy by atg <dig> shrna significantly promoted cas-/-  cell death as shown in both apoptotic elisa assays and in cell viability assays . taken together, our results indicate a novel role for cas in mediating apoptosis downstream of proteasome inhibition, and suggest that cas may do so, at least partially, by inhibiting mg132-induced autophagy.

discussion
proteasome inhibition promotes cell death via different pathways, depending on cell type and signaling context  <cit> . proteasome inhibition has also emerged as part of adjuvant therapy to increase sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. the docking protein cas in turn has been previously shown to regulate cell death in response to treatment with various anticancer therapeutics, and thus understanding the potential role that cas may have in cell death events induced by proteasome inhibition is of great interest.

we show here that cas expression is required for mg <dig> to induce cell death via the classical caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway. previous studies by others have shown that various apoptotic agents stimulate cleavage and subsequent degradation of cas. furthermore, it has been suggested that cleavage of cas might be causal to, rather than consequence of apoptosis  <cit> . in mg132-induced apoptotic cells, the mechanism of cas cleavage and the functional significance thereof appear to be more complicated than in the other apoptotic systems. thus, we show here that mg <dig> induces cas cleavage as is seen with other apoptosis inducers. however, mg <dig> additionally promotes accumulation of intact cas protein and cas fragments, including cas c-terminal fragment , most likely by increasing their stability. z-vad-fmk blocks mg132-induced apoptosis and thus should antagonize cas cleavage , but we nevertheless detect comparable amounts of cas-ct in z-vad-fmk-treated cells, suggesting that proteases other than caspases are involved in cas cleavage in these conditions . thus, we hypothesize that proteasome inhibition plays a dual role in cas degradation. on one hand, mg <dig> induces cell apoptosis and activation of caspases and other cellular proteases, promoting cas cleavage. on the other hand, and perhaps more significantly, mg <dig> facilitates accumulation of cleaved cas fragments by increasing their stability. this latter notion is supported by the observation that staurosporine induces robust apoptosis in mefs, promoting severe cas degradation with no detectable cas-ct generation. simultaneous mg <dig> treatment, however, significantly increases the accumulation of cas-ct in staurosporine-treated mef cells .

in our studies, cas cleavage and cas-ct generation were not found to be required for mg132-induced cell death, as cleavage-resistant cas mutants d748e and d416/748e effectively promoted mg132-induced cell death without generation and accumulation of cas-ct . as noted earlier, the cas-ct cleavage product has been found to induce apoptosis by suppressing p21waf1/cip <dig> expression  <cit> . here, we observed significant p21waf1/cip <dig> accumulation in all mefs treated with mg <dig>  rather, regardless of cas expression , further supporting the notion that cas mediates mg132-induced cell death by a previously unknown mechanism.

as noted in the background section, overexpression of cas in cancer cells confers resistance to anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin. we have tested doxorubicin in an mts assay in cas-/-  and cas-fl cells, and, curiously, found that similar to proteasome inhibitors, cas-/-  cells demonstrate noticeable resistance to doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity . we speculate that in cancer cells, where cas is significantly overexpressed compared to normal physiological levels, cas overexpression induces aberrant activation of numerous survival pathways, including the pi 3-kinase/akt cascade, thereby shifting the balance of bcl- <dig> family members towards survival  <cit> . in cells with greatly reduced levels of cas in turn, we speculate that activation of pathways such as autophagy and possibly others, contributes to drug resistance. as such, different levels of cas protein appear to contribute to qualitative differences in cellular signaling. understanding how these qualitative differences in signaling in response to quantitative differences in cas protein levels take place are of great importance for future studies. of note, the concept of gene and protein dosage is emerging as a major mechanism to control distinct biological events for some oncogenes  <cit> , and it is intriguing to speculate that this might be true for cas, too. clearly, more work is needed to explore this notion.

autophagy is an adaptive stress response that can both suppress cell death and promote it in the form of autophagic  cell death  <cit> . crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is complex. in response to the same stress, cells can preferentially undergo either, depending on stimulus intensity and thresholds for either response  <cit> . when cells are exposed to stress signals, autophagy may protect cells from cell death, and its inhibition can promote cell death. for instance, trail-resistant colon carcinoma cells become sensitized and undergo apoptosis when autophagy is inhibited by specific inhibitors or by beclin sirna  <cit> . in this study, we found that mg <dig> treatment induces autophagy in cas-/-  cells and that autophagy appears to protect these cells from apoptosis. this conclusion was supported by the following observations: 1) mg <dig> treatment of cas-/-  cells induced conversion of lc3-i to lc3-ii, formation of lc3-containing dot structures in the cytoplasm, and reduced levels of p <dig>  all typical markers of autophagy ; 2) increased autophagic flux in these cells was confirmed by treating them simultaneously with bafilomycin and mg <dig>  which resulted in accumulation of lc3-ii in cas-/-  cells but not in cas-fl cells ; 3) when autophagy was blocked by two different chemical autophagy inhibitors, namely 3-ma  or chloroquine , an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification, blocking the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, the final step in the autophagy pathway), or by genetic means using atg <dig> shrna, parp cleavage was significantly enhanced in cas-/-  cells treated with mg <dig> ; and 4) in accordance with the result in figure 5a that autophagy is minimally induced in mg132-treated cas-fl cells, inhibition of autophagy had limited effects on cas-fl cell apoptosis, as evidenced by parp cleavage . at the present time, it remains unclear how autophagy might protect cas -/- cells from apoptosis. however, we speculate that it might do so by, for example, promoting clearance of toxic protein aggregates formed as a result of proteasome inhibition  <cit> . without this clearance mechanism, then, cas-expressing cells would succumb to apoptotic cell death.

while induction of autophagy appears to protect cas -/-  cells from proteasome inhibition-induced cell death, it is likely that other mechanisms contribute to the survival, as well. notably, it has been reported that growth rate influences sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors  <cit> . indeed, the doubling time for cas-/- is  <dig>  hours, while it is  <dig>  hours for cas-fl cells during exponential growth phase in tissue culture . at the present time the underlying mechanisms for this difference or its impact on cell survival remain unclear.

the precise mechanism by which autophagy occurs in cas-deficient cells but not in cas-expressing cells in response to proteasome inhibition remains unknown. cas is an important docking protein downstream of integrin signaling. integrin ligation to extracellular matrix proteins upon cell attachment promotes cell survival, thus mediating anchorage-dependent cell growth, and cas has been found to be a positive regulator of these survival pathways. upon cell detachment and integrin disengagement from the extracellular matrix, cells undergo anoikis . interestingly, cell detachment can also induce autophagy, which offers protection from cell death and limits anoikis  <cit> . thus, lack of integrin signaling due to cell detachment, or due to reduced levels of an integrin signaling molecule, such as cas as shown here, appears to induce autophagy. at the present time, the molecular link between reduced integrin signaling and enhanced autophagy is lacking  <cit> . the focal adhesion protein fip <dig> interacts with atg <dig>  and becomes distributed to autophagosomes under starvation conditions. in fip200-deficient cells, autophagy induction by various treatments is abolished, and both stability and phosphorylation of atg <dig> are impaired  <cit> . similarly, the focal adhesion protein paxillin can be phosphorylated by atg <dig> and becomes redistributed from focal adhesions to the cytoplasm along with vinculin in mouse fibroblasts induced to undergo autophagy by nutrient deprivation  <cit> . furthermore, paxillin is found to be required for autophagosome formation, but that role is not dependent on integrin signaling  <cit> . interestingly, the cas sh <dig> domain reportedly targets cas to focal adhesions by interacting with paxillin   <cit> . thus, translocation of the cas-paxillin complex out of focal adhesions, or release of paxillin from the complex, may be important for autophagy to take place. this notion is supported by our preliminary studies, where we have observed that cas -/- mefs reconstituted to express a form of cas that lacks the sh3-domain  demonstrate reduced parp cleavage in response to mg132-treatment compared to cas-fl mefs . understanding whether this observation is tied to autophagy, to cas-paxillin complex formation, and uncovering how cas regulates autophagy will be an important future objective in our studies.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates a previously unidentified, novel role of cas in mediating cellular sensitivity to proteasome inhibition and, perhaps, to other apoptotic stimuli and sheds light on apoptosis-autophagy crosstalk. further studies on the mechanisms underlying the role of cas  in regulating apoptosis and autophagy could provide important insights into molecular switches governing cell death and survival.
