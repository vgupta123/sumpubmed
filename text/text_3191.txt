BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii, the etiologic agent of q fever, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that replicates within the phagolysosome of monocytes/macrophages. the ability to survive in the harsh environment of the phagolysosome may require the subversion of macrophage microbicidal mechanisms. several enzyme systems potentially required to survive in the phagolysosomal compartment, such as catalase, cytoplasmically localized superoxide dismutase , and acid phosphatase have been partially characterized  <cit> . catalase and sod activities were detected in c. burnetii whole cell lysates and were demonstrated to be maximally active at neutral ph suggesting that these enzymes were cytoplasmically localized and may be involved in detoxifying endogenously generated oxygen radicals  <cit> . additionally, heinzen et al. were able to clone a c. burnetii sod and functionally complement an e. coli soda sodb double mutant  <cit> . this c. burnetii sod was demonstrated to be homologous to known iron-containing sods. baca et al. also demonstrated that supernatants from high-speed centrifugation of sonicated c. burnetii contained acid phosphatase activity that was optimally active at low ph, localized to the periplasmic space of c. burnetii, and was capable of inhibiting superoxide anion production by stimulated human neutrophils, suggesting that this enzyme may prevent killing of the bacteria during uptake by inhibiting the respiratory burst  <cit> .

the c. burnetii genomic database from tigr predicted a putative cu/zn sod with a signal sequence . recently, stead et al. reported the presence of a putative sodc protein in supernatants from c. burnetii cultured in acidified citrate cysteine media using a flag-tag assay, which indicates the secreted nature of the sod  <cit> . periplasmically localized cu/zn sod enzymes have been identified in a wide range of gram-negative bacteria and are proposed to protect bacteria from exogenously produced toxic oxygen radicals, which indicate the potential significance of a c. burnetii cu/zn sod. for example, the survival of mycobacterium tuberculosis and salmonella typhimurium sodc mutants were reduced by 90% and  <dig> fold, respectively, compared to wild type when exposed to exogenous superoxide anion  <cit> . additionally, strohmeier gort et al. reported that an escherichia coli sodc mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide killing during stationary phase than wild type and were able to restore resistance to hydrogen peroxide killing through complementation  <cit> . here we describe the cloning, expression, and characterization of a c. burnetii cu/zn sod.

RESULTS
demonstration of cuznsod activity
a c. burnetii sodc gene was cloned into pbad, expressed in as <dig> e. coli cells and assayed for enzymatic activity using sod activity gels and a cytochrome c reduction assay. cu/znsods are inhibitable with millimolar concentrations of h2o <dig> and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate   <cit> . this characteristic can be exploited in a polyacrylamide gel system to distinguish cu/znsods from fe or mn co-factored sods. over-expression of the cloned c. burnetii sodc gene by as <dig> revealed that cu/znsod activity was inhibited by 5 mm hydrogen peroxide  but the mn co-factored e. coli sod activity was not. slight inhibition of the fe co-factored e. coli sod also occurred, which is consistent with h2o <dig> exposure . ddc, which is known to be a specific inhibitor of cu/zn co-factored sods, significantly  inhibited the activities of both the recombinant c. burnetii sod and the control bovine erythrocyte cu/zn co-factored sod, but not the mn or fe co-factored sods . without inhibitor, the recombinant c. burnetii sod demonstrated similar activity as the control sod. in the absence of sod, the ddc did lower the baseline absorbance values but did not impact the ability to determine the nature of the rcbsod ion co-factor. these data confirm that cbu <dig> indeed encodes a typical cu/znsod. the lack of detection of e. coli cu/znsod activity in the lysates from the non-induced as <dig>  is indicative of its relatively low concentration compared to that of fe and mn co-factored sods  <cit> . due to the acidic nature of the environment in which c. burnetii replicates, we predicted that the c. burnetii cu/znsod would be active at low ph. the activity of purified recombinant c. burnetii cu/znsod was assessed at three different ph values,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , using a xanthine/xanthine oxidase reduction of cytochrome c assay. activities of superoxide dismutase enzymes in this assay are determined by their ability to inhibit the reduction of cytochrome c. sodc was active at all three ph values . after 10 minutes there was approximately 45% inhibition of cytochrome c reduction by sodc at ph  <dig> , 40% inhibition of cytochrome c reduction by sodc at ph  <dig>  and 50% inhibition of cytochrome c reduction by sodc at ph  <dig> . taken together these data demonstrate that c. burnetii encodes for a copper zinc-dependent sodc, which is active at a low ph.figure  <dig> sod activity gels. c. burnetii sodc activity was assayed in crude cell extracts of e. coli as <dig> carrying c. burnetii sodc  loaded on 12% native-page gels and stained for sodc activity without and in presence of the cu/znsod inhibitor h2o <dig>  lanes: 1: e. coli mnsod  sigma-aldrich and fesod  sigma-aldrich, 2: 30 μg of e. coli as454/preb <dig> lysate, 3: 30 μg e. coli as454/preb <dig> lysate after 4 h induction with 2% arabinose. - h2o <dig> and + h2o <dig> gels are identical; however, prior to being stained for sod activity, the + h2o <dig> gel was soaked in 5 mm h2o <dig> for 1 hr.



expression and subcellular localization of c. burnetii sodc
to evaluate the expression of sodc by c. burnetii monospecific polyclonal rabbit antiserum was generated against rsodc. western blot analysis of c. burnetii whole cells lysates with this antiserum demonstrated cross reactivity with a single protein of approximately 15-kda, which is in agreement with the predicted size of the c. burnetii sodc . the slightly lower molecular weight of the c. burnetii sodc compared to the rsodc in lane two is likely due the removal of the approximately 2 kda signal sequence during the secretion process and the lack of the approximately 1 kda polyhistidine fusion tag present on the rsodc. the additional bands in lane one of figure  <dig> are likely due to antibodies in the polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against residual e. coli proteins still present in the purified rsodc preparation used to immunize the rabbit or due to previous environmental exposure of the rabbits to e. coli. in lane two of figure  <dig>  the purified rsodc appears to migrate as two bands, one band visible at approximately <dig> kda which is in line with the predicted size, and a second band visible at approximately 36 kda. the larger 36 kda band is possibly the result of recombinant protein aggregates that have formed due to the presence of imidazole in the elution buffer  <cit> . it is also possible that the presence of the larger band is due to antibodies in the polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against residual e. coli proteins still present in the purified rsodc preparation used to immunize the rabbit or due to previous environmental exposure of the rabbits to e. coli such as in lane one. given that the antibody only reacts with a single band of the right size in the c. burnetii extract , and the rsodc demonstrates cu/zn sod activity , we are confident that the 18 kda band in lane two of figure  <dig> is rsodc. localization of the c. burnetii sodc was achieved using immunoglold transmission electron microscopy on c. burnetii, nine mile,  infected l <dig> murine fibroblast cells. c. burnetii sodc was shown to localize primarily towards the outer membrane and appears even to be excreted into the phagolysosome . immunogold transmission electron microscopy was carried out on non-infected l <dig> murine fibroblasts as well and demonstrated no immunogold labelling with the rabbit anti-rsodc antibody .figure  <dig> western blot analysis of c. burnetii cell lysate. c. burnetii whole cell lysates were probed with polyclonal rabbit antiserum against rsodc. the polyclonal rabbit sera reacted with an approximately 18-kda antigen in top10preb <dig> induced with 2% arabinose , purified rsodc , and c. burnetii nine mile phase i cell lysates .



complementation of an e. coli sodc mutant with recombinant c. burnetii sodc
the lack of a well-established genetics system for c. burnetii requires the use of heterologous cloning to assess c. burnetii gene function. preb <dig> was transformed into an e. coli sodc mutant that was previously demonstrated to be highly susceptible to h2o <dig> killing in stationary phase  <cit> . the ability of the recombinant sodc to compliment an e. coli sodc mutant was assessed by comparing sensitivities to exogenously added h2o <dig>  when exposed to 2 mm h2o <dig> the wild type  strain was sensitive and the sodc mutant  strain was highly sensitive to killing during the onset of stationary phase. cells became resistant to h2o <dig> once again approximately 3 h later . this observation is in agreement with what strohmeier-gort et al. had previously reported for these strains  <cit> . strain as <dig> complemented with preb <dig>  when induced with 2% arabinose, demonstrated resistance to h2o <dig> killing similar to the wild type strain. growth rates for all three strains were similar .figure  <dig> complementation of e. coli sodc mutant. e. coli as <dig>  with c. burnetii sodc  under induced  and uninduced  conditions. percent survival was determined after treatment with 2 mm h2o <dig> at 45 min intervals and compared to wild-type e. coli an <dig> . the symbols and error bars represent the averages and standard deviations of three replicates.



discussion
there is mounting evidence that demonstrates the importance of cu/znsod enzymes in bacterial protection against oxidative killing. in fact, inactivation of the sodc gene has been found to cause attenuation of virulence in a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . the potential importance of a cu/znsod for the intracellular survival of c. burnetii is apparent by the obligate intracellular nature of this pathogen. in an effort to begin to characterize the potential role of this enzyme in c. burnetii intracellular survival a 570-bp region containing the signal sequence of the c. burnetii sodc gene was pcr amplified, cloned into pbad-topo, and expressed as a fusion protein in top <dig> e. coli cells. the copper-zinc nature of this sod was demonstrated by its inhibition by ddc and h2o <dig> using xanthine oxidase and native page as demonstrated for other bacterial cu/znsod enzymes  <cit> . several previously characterized cu/znsod enzymes contain signal sequences and were demonstrated to localize to the periplasmic space  <cit>  leading to the hypothesis that these enzymes aid in the detoxification of superoxide  produced by the host. the observations that the c. burnetii sodc is expressed by c. burnetii and localizes towards the periphery supports the hypothesis that this enzyme functions in a low ph environment and may play a role in protecting c. burnetii from exogenously produced reactive oxygen intermediates.

it has been well established that c. burnetii is an acidophile  <cit>  and although the cytoplasmic ph of the organism remains near neutral  <cit> , the periplasmic space is presumably acidic. therefore, we hypothesized that a periplasmically localized cu/znsod in c. burnetii would be active at low ph to defend the organism from phagocyte derived o2−. to test this hypothesis, the ability of purified, recombinant c. burnetii cu/znsod to inhibit cytochrome c reduction at low ph was determined. the recombinant cu/znsod did retain activity at a ph of  <dig>  suggesting that indeed this enzyme could function in the periplasmic space and protect c. burnetii from host derived o2−. interestingly, unlike acid phosphatase and catalase activity previously demonstrated for c. burnetii, we were not able to detect optimal enzymatic activity at any of the three ph values tested for the cuznsod. maximal catalase activity was detected at ph  <dig>  with much lower activity detected at ph  <dig> , whereas optimum acid phosphatase activity was observed at ph  <dig>  and significantly decreased as the ph was raised  <cit> . bovine cu/znsod for example has been shown to retain activity in  <dig>  m urea or 2% sds and exhibit essentially constant activity over the ph range  <dig> – <dig>   <cit> . however, e. coli cu/znsod is very thermolabile and sensitive to ph  <cit> . thus, whether or not c. burnetii cu/znsod does have a ph optimum requires further study, but our data clearly demonstrates that this enzyme is active at low ph.

standard methods such as targeted gene disruption, antibiotic selection and growth on axenic media used to manipulate free living bacteria have not been readily available for c. burnetii. although the genetic transformation of c. burnetii was first reported in  <dig>  <cit>  and later in  <dig>  <cit>  along with the ability to grow c. burnetii axenic media  <cit> , performing targeted mutagenesis remains challenging. this inability to readily manipulate c. burnetii genetically has led to the use of heterologous cloning as a means to study the organism’s genes and regulatory functions. c. burnetii genes such as dnaj, era, pyrb, sdhcdab, icd, rnc, and soda/sodb were used to successfully complement paralogous gene mutations in e. coli  <cit> . to test functional expression of the c. burnetii cu/znsod, preb <dig> was transformed into an e. coli sodc mutant  that was previously demonstrated to be highly susceptible to h2o <dig> killing in stationary phase  <cit> . over expression of the c. burnetii sodc restored resistance of the e. coli sodc mutant to h2o <dig> killing to wild type levels. immunoblot analysis confirmed that expression of c. burnetii sodc in as <dig> was achieved only upon induction, suggesting that the restored resistance of the complemented mutant was not due to an artifact of preb <dig> or some unknown factor . this data suggests that this enzyme does possess antioxidant properties and supports the hypothesis that this enzyme may play a role in c. burnetii intracellular survival in an oxidative stress environment.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that c. burnetii does express a cu/znsod that is functional at low ph, which appears to be excreted, and was able to restore h2o <dig> resistance in an e. coli sodc mutant. these studies provide the framework to evaluate the role that c. burnetii sodc plays in intracellular survival. to address this issue, the potential for regulation of this enzyme during oxidative stress and/or by rpos is currently under investigation, which should provide insight about the possible role of this enzyme in a developmental life cycle and virulence.
