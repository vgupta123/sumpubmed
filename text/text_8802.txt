BACKGROUND
metallothioneins  are low molecular weight, cysteine-rich metal chelators with an ability to bind heavy metal ions. mts are able to bind a variety of metal ions by the formation of mercaptide bonds between numerous cys residues  and the metal, and thus contribute to metal detoxification by buffering cytosolic metal concentration  <cit> . mts typically contain two metal-binding, cysteine-rich domains that give these metalloproteins a dumbbell conformation. they are widely distributed in animals, plants, fungi as well as cyanobacteria. based on sequence similarities and their phylogenetic relationships, mts have been broadly classified into three types  <cit> . class i mts are widespread in vertebrates and have  <dig> conserved cysteine residues giving them the dumbbell conformation. class ii mts do not have this strict arrangement of cysteine residues and are widespread in plants, fungi and invertebrates. on the other hand, phytochelatins, which are enzymatically synthesized metal binding peptides, are described as class iii mts.

plant mts identified so far contain two cysteine-rich domains and a large spacer region   <cit> . these mts have only a few histidines, while their cys content varies between  <dig> and  <dig> residues. on the other hand, the number of aromatic amino acids in plant mts varies from none to several. based on the distribution of cysteine residues, number of aromatic amino acids as well as length of the spacer region, plant mts are further classified into four types, type  <dig> through  <dig>  <cit> . analysis of various est database shows that mts are amongst the highly abundant transcripts in plants  <cit> . recent studies have established important roles for plant mts in fruit development, root development and suberization besides heavy metal tolerance  <cit> . furthermore, the role of plant mts in abiotic stresses such as oxidative, dehydration, senescence as well as hormonal alterations have also been shown  <cit> . the antioxidant function of mts is attributed to the presence of a large number of cysteine residues, which besides metal binding are also capable of ros scavenging  <cit> . recently, a type  <dig> mt from mustard i.e. lsc <dig> has been reported to be induced by ros production  <cit> . further, lsc <dig> has also been documented to be related to ros imbalance during leaf senescence. similarly, in rice, several type  <dig> and type  <dig> mts have been found to play a direct role in antioxidation  <cit> .

abiotic stresses, a major factor in reducing plant productivity, are proving to be an increasing threat to agriculture. development of genetically modified abiotic stress tolerant varieties may provide a solution to this problem  <cit> . recently, we have characterized the molecular response of rice seedlings towards salinity stress based on their subtractive transcriptome profiling  <cit> . one of the key members of this response, osmt1e-p – a type  <dig> mt isolated from a salinity tolerant genotype i.e. o. sativa cv. pokkali has been reported to be induced strongly in response to salinity stress. in the present communication, we provide detailed investigations on osmt1e-p. in essence, we have found that osmt1e-p is transcriptionally induced in response to salinity stress. ectopic expression of osmt1e-p in transgenic tobacco  provides stress tolerance against salinity, drought, cold, heat and heavy metals . osmt1e-p over expressing plants accumulate lower amount of ros  under salinity stress. further, we also show that at least five members of type  <dig> mt are tightly clustered on the distal arm of chromosome xii which show co-regulation in response to various abiotic stress conditions. based on these results, we propose that osmt1e-p may serve as an important “candidate gene” for raising ‘multi-stress tolerant’ crops.

RESULTS
mt gene family in rice: highly conserved gene family with  <dig> members clustered on chromosome xii
the whole genome analysis of rice  revealed the presence of  <dig> mt genes and  <dig> protein products in o. sativa sp. japonica which have been further subdivided into four types . in arabidopsis, nine mt members have been reported previously  <cit> . the presence of multiple metallothionein genes may indicate their diverse role in plant responses. their high numbers in plants may also be related to their distinct and overlapping biological roles by the regulation of gene expression and signaling  <cit> . the classification of these mt proteins was performed based on the conserved cysteine residue positions  <cit> . the members of the mt protein family were named as osmt, where the first two initials represent the name of the organism viz. ‘os’ for oryza sativa followed by metallothionein abbreviated as ‘mt’. the numeral  represents the type of mt and alphabet represents the member number identified, numerals following the alphabet represent alternatively spliced products. there are eight members in type 1-osmt <dig> ; type  <dig> has five members ; whereas type  <dig> and type  <dig> have only one member each . 

the multiple sequence alignment of the various rice mt protein sequences  with the protein sequence of mt gene cloned in our laboratory from indica rice genotype pokkali, osmt1e-p  has been shown in additional file 1: figure s1a. based on this analysis, it could be concluded that rice mts share a very high degree of conservation . two of them i.e. osmt1a <dig> and osmt1a <dig> have an additional stretch of  <dig> amino acids which is not present in any other type  <dig> members. the rooted phylogenetic tree of mts reported from arabidopsis and rice  showed a very close relationship between them . osmt1e-p of pokkali was observed to have 100% identity with osmt1e member of o. sativa sp. japonica and both of them clustered with other type i members.

chromosomal localization of the various mt members in o. sativa is shown in figure 1a. these osmts were found to be scattered on only six chromosomes i.e. i, iii, v, x, xi and xii. three members of the type  <dig> mt proteins - osmt2a , osmt2d and osmt2c were located on chromosome i, while the fourth, osmt2b, was located on chromosome v. the type  <dig> and type  <dig> classes, having a single member each, were located on chromosome i and chromosome x, respectively. thus, as far as chromosomal localization is concerned, no specific arrangement of mts belonging to type  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were noticed. in contrast, most of the type  <dig> mt genes were found to be tightly clustered together  on chromosome xii . two of these genes namely osmt1f and osmt1c were found to be on the antisense strand, while other three osmt1a, osmt1g and osmt1d were found to be on the sense strand. in-silico analysis of various osmt <dig> genes revealed that they share highly identical gene structure i.e. three exons and two introns per gene, except the alternatively spliced osmt1a <dig> which shows the presence of two exons and a single intron . this unique arrangement of mts in near vicinity on chromosome xii and their high sequence conservation possibly indicate that the present situation is the result of segmental duplication of chromosome. to test this hypothesis, we performed sequence analysis of these regions of chromosomes using mummer software. this analysis indicated that certain regions of chromosome xii  may have got duplicated and diverged further during the course of evolution. further, analysis of various orthologous members with respect to the osmt1e gene showed that osmt1a, osmt1b, osmt1c, osmt1f and osmt1g belong to the same orthologous group. thus, it can be inferred that osmt1e gene might have got duplicated on chromosome xii at several instances and thus got further diverged from each other. dot plot analysis  of the region showed that these genes have diverged enough but during this process, they have preserved their metallothionein signatures as well. earlier, analysis of genomes of maize, rice and wheat has led to the identification and characterization of shared duplications between rice and wheat  <cit> . interestingly, mt genes in rice were not observed to be in synteny with maize, sorghum, wheat and barley. however, the extensive duplication and evolution of type  <dig> mts in rice reinforces their importance in plants. 

quantitative real-time pcr analysis indicated co-regulation of clustered metallothionein genes
since osmt1a, osmt1c, osmt1d, osmt1f and osmt1g genes were found tightly clustered on chromosome xii, we wanted to check if these genes are ‘transcriptionally co-regulated’ as well. for this purpose, qrt-pcr was carried out with cdna prepared from shoots of rice seedlings subjected to salinity, drought and aba stress. figure 1b shows transcript abundance for three of these genes namely osmt1a, osmt1c and osmt1d. this analysis indicated that these three “tightly placed” genes are down regulated under salinity stress as well as exogenous aba application while up regulated after  <dig> h of drought stress . however, we could not quantify the transcripts for other two genes namely osmt1g and osmt1f which may be due to the extremely low abundance of transcripts of these genes under the tested conditions . this data clearly indicates that these clustered metallothionein genes are co-regulated under various stresses in the shoots of rice seedlings. similar observation has been made previously where co-expression of nuclear genes, coding for different subunits of photosystem or proteins involved in the transcription/translation of plastome having overlapping functions, has been documented as a novel mechanism for co-ordinated regulation of gene expression  <cit> .

salinity and development regulated expression of osmt1e-p
plant stress responses often mimic certain normal developmental processes  <cit> . interaction between development and environmental conditions implies that some genes must be co-regulated by both environmental and developmental cues. since osmt1e-p was found to be induced strongly in response to salinity stress  <cit> , detailed investigations on its transcript regulation and functional validation was carried out. to see the effect of development on transcript accumulation of osmt1ep in rice plants, we looked into publically available microarray data. very high transcript abundance for osmt1ep was noted at two most stress sensitive stages of plant development i.e. seedling and reproductive stage . the vegetative and tillering stages showed relatively low abundance for this transcript. these results are in line with the existing literature where various stress responsive genes have been shown to have developmental regulation and a stage specific pattern of their induction has been reported  <cit> . 

it has been established in literature that both ‘very early’ and ‘late’ responses associated with salinity stress have their own significance. the very early response is generally the ‘shock response’ while the late responses may often have genetic basis  <cit> . since the osmt1e-p gene was obtained in a salinity stress specific subtractive library  <cit> , rna gel blot analysis was carried out to study the effect of salt stress on transcript abundance in rice seedlings. we have carried out this transcript abundance analysis twice but data from only one such representative set is presented in figure 2b. transcripts for osmt1ep could be detected in rice seedlings even under non-stress conditions which were further induced during salinity stress . the transcript levels further increased in response to  <dig> h of stress treatment and continued to increase up to  <dig> h of stress . even after  <dig> h of stress, induced levels of osmt1e-p could be detected, though lesser as compared to that in response to  <dig> h of stress.

the salinity stress inducibility of osmt1e-p was also observed at the tillering stage as its transcript increases within 30’ and  <dig> h of salinity stress . in this case, we could again see a clear time-dependent transcript accumulation pattern in response to salinity stress. we have further extended this analysis to various tissues of mature rice plants grown under standard agronomic practices. in figure 2d, it could be seen that the various tissues of the mature rice plants maintain differential levels for osmt1e-p transcripts which in turn are differentially regulated by salinity stress. all the tissues analyzed in this study i.e. inflorescence, upper stem, lower stem, upper leaf, lower leaf and roots showed a constitutive level of expression for osmt1e-p, with roots and inflorescence showing the highest levels. moreover, the constitutive levels of transcripts were higher at maturity stage than seedling and tillering stage. osmt1e-p was further found to be induced by salinity in all the tissues except roots and inflorescence, where down regulation of the transcripts could be seen in response to salinity stress. it is interesting to note that both the apical tissue of the mature plant behave differently from all other tissue.

the expression patterns obtained in mature plant tissues are in agreement with the previous studies where type  <dig> mt-like transcripts have been detected primarily in roots, senescing leaves, stems, leaves and flowers  <cit> . several rice mt <dig> and mt <dig> genes show high transcript accumulation in roots, seedlings as well as stem  <cit> . probably, the down-regulation of osmt1e-p expression in the early phase of stress results in an oxidative burst phase, which potentiates ros to function as a signal in salinity stress tolerance. roots are the most appropriate site for initiating stresses response as they are the primary site of perception and injury for several types of water-limiting stresses, including salinity and drought. under many circumstances, it is the stress-sensitivity of the root that limits the productivity of the entire plant. a high level of osmt1e-p induction was detected in the leaves, while relatively low induction was detected in stem . leaves are more sensitive than stem due to the presence of highly developed photosynthetic apparatus which is an active site for ros production  <cit>  and hence metallothionein induction in leaves is important for protection under abiotic stress.

osmt1e-p transgenic plants show enhanced tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses including salinity
the response of plants to abiotic stress consists of a coordinated function of several biochemical pathways to regulate cellular ion homeostasis, enabling the plant to show tolerance and yield stability under saline environments. reports have suggested that although abiotic stress is a multigenic trait, stress tolerant plants could be produced by transgenic approaches by the transfer of a single or multiple genes. several genes such as barley hva <dig> <cit> , rice cdpk <cit> , alfalfa alfin <dig> <cit> , tobacco npk <dig> <cit> , and brassica glyi and rice glyii <cit>  have been expressed in transgenic plants to enhance their stress tolerance  <cit> .

to establish the role of osmt1e-p gene in abiotic stress tolerance, the full length gene cloned in pcambia <dig> vector  was introduced into tobacco plants by agrobacterium mediated transformation . the preliminary screening of putative tobacco transformants was performed with tissue pcr, employing primers designed based on the t-dna sequence that flanks the cloned osmt1e-p gene. three independently transformed t <dig> transgenic plants  were randomly selected for subsequent analysis. the integration of the osmt1e-p gene into the tobacco genome was further confirmed by pcr analysis. a single band of  <dig> bp, corresponding to the osmt1e-p cdna, was observed in transgenic plants while no band was detected in the wt plants . northern blot analysis of wild type and t <dig> lines showed the presence of higher transcript levels in all the transgenic plants in comparison to wt under normal growth condition . moreover, increase in the transcript was observed in both wt and transgenic lines when subjected to salinity . these results show that a transcript signal corresponding to the size of osmt1e-p transcript was detected in wt tobacco plants also, under stress conditions, when rice osmt1e-p gene was used as probe. this indicated that endogenous gene for mt1e in tobacco gets up regulated under salt stress condition. since it gets detected when rice osmt1e-p was used as probe, it indicates that there is a good sequence homology between the two orthologs. densitometry analysis showed that osmt1e-p transcript abundance was higher in transgenic lines as compared to wild type maintained under control  as well as salinity stress conditions .

since, osmt1e-p is also a putative metal binding protein, multiple stress tolerance ability of osmt1e-p ectopic expressing lines  were assayed at the seedling stage by transferring them to various concentrations of nacl , peg , znso <dig> and cuso <dig>  and monitoring their growth for  <dig> days. all osmt1e-p transgenic seedlings showed comparable growth in the absence of nacl . however, in the presence of mild salinity , a strong difference in seedling growth was observed between wt and transgenic lines. when exposed to  <dig> mm nacl, strong contrast was observed in growth pattern where the transgenic seedlings grew much better as compared to wt seedlings. wt seedlings just could not grow in the presence of higher levels of salinity , but most of the seedlings of transgenic lines were able to grow well under similar conditions. similarly, transgenic seedlings outperformed wt plants under 5% peg or znso <dig>  however, in the presence of  <dig> mm cuso <dig>  the wt and transgenic lines behaved almost the same way where growth of the seedlings was almost arrested. histograms depicting the differences in the fresh weight of transgenic vis-a-vis wild type tobacco lines show a clear advantage of osmt1e-p ectopic expression, particularly under salinity, peg and zinc stress . stress mitigating capacity of several plant metallothionein genes is mediated through their metal binding capacity  <cit> . when released from metallothionein proteins, zn2+/cu2+ ions become available for antioxidant metal binding enzymes e.g. cu, zn-superoxide dismutase and may also help in spatial regulation of oxidoreductive environment in the cell  <cit> . mts have been reported to initiate zn2+ mediated antioxidant response in mammals and fungi  <cit> . improved growth and survival of osmt1e-p transgenic plants under multiple stresses is proposed to be mediated through maintenance of redox balance and thereby reducing ros induced injury.

leaf disc assay has been shown to be one of the quick assays for assessing the tolerance of plants towards salinity stress  <cit> . we also performed this assay with t <dig> plants in the presence of high salinity . all the transgenic lines  showed considerably better chlorophyll retention under high salinity , while wt lines showed excessive bleaching under similar conditions . to explore if the ectopic expression of osmt1ep is contributing towards better ion homeostasis, ionic measurements were carried out in leaves of the salt-stressed wt and transgenic plants. this study revealed that there was relatively less disturbance in the ion balance in transgenic plants as compared to the wt plants under salinity stress. under control conditions, a k+/na+ ratio in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> was observed for both wt and transgenic plants while a drastic decline was observed in wt when subjected to  <dig> mm nacl  and  <dig> mm nacl  for  <dig> days . in contrast, the transgenic lines maintained this ratio between  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  under  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm nacl, respectively. maintenance of k+/na+ homeostasis is considered as an important aspect of salinity tolerance in plants and the higher k+/na+ levels are very well correlated with enhanced salinity tolerance  <cit> .

reduced accumulation of h2o <dig> in the transgenic lines shows their enhanced antioxidant activity
abiotic stresses like drought, high salinity and low temperature ultimately lead to oxidative stress due to the disturbance in ros production and scavenging, leading to generation of reactive oxygen species , such as h2o <dig> <cit> . in biological systems, ros are highly reactive and toxic. they partially reduce or activate derivatives of oxygen and thus damage dna, proteins and carbohydrates, resulting in cell death, ultimately  <cit> . ros also cause lipid peroxidation and cell membrane damage and their levels can reflect the degree of damage to cellular components  <cit> . because ectopic expression of osmt1e-p improved the salt stress tolerance of transgenic tobacco plants, we examined whether osmt1e-p functions in stress tolerance through detoxification of ros. for this purpose, leaves of the wt and transgenic lines , subjected to salt stress for  <dig> min,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h were stained with dab to reveal in planta accumulation of h2o <dig>  histochemical staining showed that under control conditions, transgenic lines had ros levels similar to wt. salinity stress resulted in notable increase in ros levels in wt within  <dig> min as these leaves showed intense brown colored polymer accumulation in midribs and veins . however under similar condition, the leaves of transgenic lines showed remarkably less accumulation of brown colored polymer implying less ros production. this contrast in h2o <dig> levels between wt and transgenic lines was noticed even after longer durations of salinity stress . the visual observation of the quantitative difference in the h2o <dig> accumulation was reconfirmed by densitometric scanning of the dab stained leaves . after  <dig> h of stress, transgenic lines also show a slight increase in h2o <dig> level but still much lower than that of wt plants . out of the three transgenic lines studied here, line l <dig> was found to be relatively more tolerant to salinity stress than the other two. as ros levels during stress greatly relies on the homeostasis between ros generation and removal  <cit> , accumulation of less ros in the transgenic lines seems to indicate that ros scavenging systems in these plants might work more effectively as compared to wt. mts can protect plants by participating in signaling  or adaptation . up regulation of the antioxidant thiol protein, mt during late phases of oxidative stress, helps in mitigating stress by scavenging the ros probably through the oxidation of cysteine thiols  <cit> . recently, a number of reports have demonstrated mts as efficient ros scavengers in animals  <cit> . based on this analysis, we propose that osmt1e-p may enhance plant stress tolerance through the up regulation of antioxidative enzymes and the reduction of ros. 

ectopic expression of osmt1e-p in tobacco provides multiple stress tolerance in subsequent generations
since we found that transgenic tobacco seedlings  outperform the wt plants in the leaf disc assays under salinity stress , we decided to extend the analysis to t <dig> generation and also various abiotic stresses such as dehydrations , cold, heavy metals  and high temperature. leaf disc assays showed a clear advantage of transgenic lines over wt plants in overcoming the deleterious effects of nacl toxicity. the wt plants showed rapid senescence and extensive bleaching reflecting symptoms of injury due to stress, while the transgenic lines performed better under similar conditions . chlorosis was also less in transgenic lines under peg stress , cold stress, znso <dig>  and copper  while the wt was completely bleached under similar conditions. however, under high temperature stress, even the transgenic lines showed injury symptoms  but were still better than wt plants. the results of leaf disc assay were confirmed biochemically by estimating the chlorophyll content. there was nearly complete loss of chlorophyll in the wt plants, whereas the osmt1e-p transformants showed relatively less reduction in total chlorophyll content at  <dig> mm nacl . similar observations were made in response to other stresses and these results were also validated statistically as shown in different alphabets on top of the bars in figure 5b. these observations establish a positive relationship  between the ectopic expression of osmt1e-p and salinity tolerance, dehydration stress as well as heavy metal tolerance  in leaf tissues. another rice type i metallothionein, osmt1a has been reported to provide tolerance against drought and oxidative stress besides being involved in zn2+ homeostasis and its over expression leads to higher zn2+ accumulation in rice seeds  <cit> . in arabidopsis, all  <dig> types of mt proteins provide cu2+ tolerance in yeast cup <dig> mutant  <cit> . similar metal toxicity alleviation has been reported in arabidopsis where the mt <dig> knockdown lines were hypersensitive to cd2+ and accumulated several fold lower levels of cd2+, and zn2+ than wt  <cit> . 

osmt1e-p transgenic plants flower normally and set viable seeds under high salinity
since osmt1ep seedlings were found to perform better than wt seedlings in response to salinity stress, we decided to test the performance of these plants under extended durations of stress. for this purpose, we used saline water for watering of plants till maturity. we found that while transgenic plants grew normally, flowered and produced seeds even in the presence of  <dig> mm nacl, wt plants exhibited stunted growth, failed to flower and completely senesced before reaching maturity . several growth parameters viz. plant height, fresh weight, days to flower and pod weight of transgenic plants grown under salinity stress were compared with the similar parameters obtained from wt plants irrigated with water instead of salinity . plant height and fresh weight measurements clearly suggests the capacity of osmt1e-p transgenic plants in retaining higher biomass than wt under saline conditions or even wt plants under non saline conditions . flowering time was slightly delayed  in osmt1e-p transgenic plants grown under stress vis-à-vis wt plants maintained under control conditions. however, it did not affect the seed setting and the overall yield of transgenic plants growing under salinity stress and the yield was comparable  to that obtained from wt plants growing under non stress conditions . accumulation of various elements was analyzed in osmt1ep transgenic plants using energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence  spectrometry which is a very useful technique for the identification of trace elements from the plant tissues  <cit> . osmt1e-p ectopically expressing plants accumulate negligible na+ as well as heavy metals cu2+ and zn2+ in upper leaf and pods as compared to older leaves and roots . high accumulation of na+ and cu2+ in root indicates the ability of osmt1e-p plants to use roots and lower leaves as sink thereby restricting the mobilization of deleterious amounts of these elements in the upper vegetative tissue and pods. these parameters thus clearly establish a positive correlation of osmt1ep ectopic expression with salinity and heavy metal tolerance in tobacco plants. 

CONCLUSIONS
expression of osmt1e-p gene is regulated by multiple abiotic stresses in a development and organ specific manner and is therefore an important candidate gene for abiotic stress tolerance. it is proposed that osmt1e-p helps in detoxification and cellular repair while maintaining the cellular homeostasis via ros scavenging directly or indirectly via other antioxidants. however, further studies are warranted to work out the precise mechanism to link their metal binding affinity with abiotic stress tolerance. osmt1e-p probably interacts with other physiological processes in the cell for selective uptake and sequestration of ions during salinity stress.
