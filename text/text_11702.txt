BACKGROUND
sorghum , a major staple food and fodder crop, is among the world's most important cereals, typically ranking fifth globally in terms of annual tonnage  <cit> . the crop is tolerant of many biotic and abiotic stresses and is often grown in more marginal cropping areas and is frequently preferentially grown in water-limited environments in both developed and developing countries  <cit> . in developing countries it tends to be a staple food and forage of the poor. in developed countries it is used primarily as an animal feed, and in australia is currently grown on over  <dig>  ha, producing over  <dig>  m tonnes of grain  <cit> . more recently, tropical sorghum cultivars have garnered much attention as a cellulosic biofuels crop. sorghum breeding programs around the world are working towards improved varieties with better quality, disease-resistance, drought tolerance and agronomic traits . molecular breeding strategies are increasingly being adopted to develop genetic linkage maps and to identify genomic regions influencing traits of importance in sorghum, e.g. stay-green  <cit>  fertility restoration  <cit> , ergot resistance  <cit> , midge resistance  <cit>  and photo-period sensitivity  <cit> .

genetic linkage maps are an essential prerequisite for studying the inheritance of both qualitative and quantitative traits, to develop markers for molecular breeding, for map-based gene cloning and for comparative genomic studies. molecular breeding is more effective if the molecular map is densely populated with markers, in order to provide more choice in the quality and type of marker and to increase the probability of polymorphic markers in important chromosomal intervals. sorghum genome mapping based on dna markers began in the early 1990s and numerous genetic linkage maps of sorghum have been published in the last decade  <cit> . the early maps were based primarily on rflp markers, with more recent maps also including aflps and ssrs and very recently, diversity array technology  markers. the advent of the new dart marker technology  <cit>  offers a rapid and sequence-independent shortcut to medium-density whole genome scans of any plant species. as dart assays are performed on highly parallel and automated platforms, the cost per datapoint  is reduced by at least an order of magnitude compared to current, gel-based technologies. additionally, dart clones can be readily sequenced thereby allowing marker integration into the emerging sequence of the sorghum genome . it is essential to integrate the rapidly growing body of genetic linkage data produced through dart with the existing genetic linkage maps generated through other marker technologies. additionally, the majority of sorghum genetic linkage maps published to date are based on crosses wider than most crosses routinely made in sorghum breeding programs. however, for application in molecular breeding strategies, genetic linkage maps based on wide crosses are often of limited utility, as they are not representative of the genome organisation and gene function of the cultivated gene pool  <cit> . the construction of a consensus map synthesising the information provided by multiple segregating populations, of diverse genetic backgrounds, provides a very important reference resource; it offers the opportunity to map a larger number of loci than in most single crosses, thus increasing the number of potentially useful markers across divergent genetic backgrounds and providing greater genome coverage, in addition to providing opportunities to validate marker order.

here, we report on the comparison of the genetic linkage maps obtained from six independent component maps and on the integration of the component maps into a single consensus linkage map of sorghum. one of the component maps used, based on btx623/is3620c, developed at texas a&m university and usda-ars scientists  <cit> , is a reference mapping population in the sorghum genomics community and has been the subject of extensive phenotypic and genotypic analysis. its inclusion in this study offers opportunities to link the consensus map to existing genetic and physical maps based on this population. the consensus map, consisting of over  <dig> markers, also offers an opportunity to create a "bridge" between dart and other marker systems, through the co-location of the different marker types, including rflps and ssrs.

RESULTS
component maps of individual populations
the parental genotypes of the six component mapping populations varied in their level of polymorphism per cross , with the parents of the s <dig> population being the most diverse and the parents of the s <dig> population the least diverse.

the table includes the pedigree of each population, the dissimilarity index  between the parental genotypes of each component mapping population, as calculated using the darwin software  <cit> , the generation and population size, and details of the number and type of markers.

the component maps constructed using the multipoint software contained between  <dig>  and  <dig>  loci and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  lines . the lengths of the resulting maps varied between  <dig> and  <dig> cm . clusters of markers with skewed segregation were identified in all six of the sorghum linkage maps developed . the percentage of skewed markers was very similar across all six populations, varying from  <dig> % in the cirad population to  <dig> % in the s <dig> population. a significant number of the markers showing skewed segregation in each population were also linked by at least  <dig> cm to markers that didn't show distorted segregation patterns. for example, in the tamu-ars population, of the  <dig> markers showing segregation distortion,  <dig> of them were linked within  <dig> cm to unskewed markers. two-thirds of these  <dig> markers were co-dominant marker types , with the remaining one third  markers having a dominant inheritance pattern ; which reflects the relative proportion of codominant  and dominant  markers overall in the tamu-ars map. the distribution pattern of chromosomal regions associated with skewed marker segregation showed some similarity across maps, e.g. the distal end of the short arm of sbi- <dig> showed skewed marker segregation in four of the six maps ; the lack of segregation distortion in the two remaining maps  might be explained by poor marker resolution in this chromosomal region. it has been proposed  <cit>  that when a chromosomal region contains four or more closely linked markers which are significantly and consistently deviating from the 1: <dig> ratio it can be regarded as having skewed segregation. by following this proposition and defining the closely linked markers as being less than  <dig> cm apart,  <dig> markers on the consensus map  were identified as having skewed segregation in one or more of the component populations, covering 34% of the consensus map length. of these  <dig> markers,  <dig>  were dart markers, which reflects the relative proportion of dart  versus non-dart markers  overall in the consensus map.

the table includes the pedigree of each population, the dissimilarity index  between the parental genotypes of each component mapping population, as calculated using the darwin software  <cit> , the generation and population size, and details of the number and type of markers.

consensus map construction and features
a total of  <dig> markers  were in common, i.e. they were mapped in at least two mapping populations. a total of  <dig> markers  were unique to a particular mapping population, while seven dart loci were mapped in five or more mapping populations. the order of those markers that segregated in more than one population was highly consistent between the six individual mapping data sets. fig.  <dig> illustrates this high degree of marker colinearity of all the markers in common with the tamu-ars base map. a difference ratio was calculated per chromosome  <cit> , to compare the genetic distances between each map and the tamu-ars base map , where a distance ratio of  <dig> indicates identical genetic distances between two maps and a distance ratio of  <dig> indicates complete dissimilarity of genetic distances between two maps. the number of intervals in common with the tamu-ars population varied across populations, from just  <dig> in the s <dig> map to  <dig> in the cirad map. the overall difference ratios in genetic distance between the tamu-ars map and the five other maps varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the difference ratios also varied for each chromosome, with sbi- <dig> having the lowest difference ratios  and sbi- <dig> having the highest difference ratios . the high difference ratios observed across maps for some chromosomes, specifically sbi- <dig>  sbi- <dig>  sbi- <dig>  sbi- <dig> and sbi- <dig>  were due to the low number of sampling intervals; in some cases as low as  <dig> interval in common per lg . in some cases, there were no intervals in common for particular chromosomes across maps, e.g. s6/tamu-ars for sbi- <dig>  sbi- <dig> and sbi- <dig> and s5/tamu-ars for sbi- <dig> 

as observed previously  <cit> , markers mapping to more than one locus can create problems during consensus map construction, if not recognised. in the present study, just under one quarter  of the total number of unique markers mapped across the six component maps were in common in more than one population, and of these only  <dig> mapped to two different loci in different populations . as expected, due to the use of the same dart array across populations, the majority of the markers in common across maps were dart markers . consequently, a higher proportion of the multicopy markers overall were dart markers  versus non-dart markers ;  <dig> ssrs  and  <dig> rflp . sbi- <dig> contained the highest number of multicopy markers .

the sorghum consensus map consisted of a total of  <dig> markers mapped to  <dig> unique loci . of the  <dig> unique markers placed on the consensus map, there were  <dig>  common markers; only  <dig> common markers from the total of  <dig> across all six component maps were excluded from the consensus map due to inconsistency in marker location. of these common markers included,  <dig> were selected as bridge markers on the  <dig> sorghum chromosomes, i.e. markers which mapped to the base map  and which were also present and in a consistent location in one or more of the other mapping populations. sbi- <dig> had the highest number of bridge markers overall , of which  <dig> %  were dart markers . sbi- <dig>  and sbi- <dig>  had the lowest number of bridge markers, of which  <dig> % and  <dig> % were dart markers, respectively. the remaining chromosomes had between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bridge markers, of which between  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  were dart markers. the  <dig> bridge markers, which consisted of  <dig> dart markers,  <dig> ssr markers and  <dig> rflp markers, spanning  <dig>  cm with an average density of one marker every  <dig>  cm, were used for the projection of the remaining markers onto the bridge consensus map.

on average, each chromosome on the consensus map contained  <dig> markers of which  <dig> % were dart markers. chromosome sbi- <dig> had the highest number of markers  overall but one of the lowest percentages of dart markers  , with an average marker density of 1/ <dig>  cm, followed by chromosome sbi- <dig> , with an average marker density of 1/ <dig>  cm. chromosome sbi- <dig> had the lowest number of markers .

the consensus map spanned a total length of  <dig>  cm, based on the distances calculated from the tamu-ars segregation data. chromosome sizes ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  . the 'spb' dart markers alone spanned  <dig> % of the total length of the consensus map, ranging from 100% of chromosomes sbi- <dig>  sbi- <dig>  sbi- <dig> and sbi- <dig> to  <dig> % coverage for sbi- <dig> and sbi- <dig> 

the approximate locations of the pericentromeric regions of heterochromatin were identified , based on the integration of sorghum linkage, cytogenetic and physical maps  <cit> . non-random patterns of dna marker distribution were observed, with some clear marker-dense regions and some marker-rare regions. the consensus map had only  <dig> gaps larger than  <dig> cm and only  <dig> gaps between  <dig> and  <dig> cm; the longest one  on the distal end of the long arm of sbi-05; one  on the distal end of the long arm of sbi- <dig>  and one  on the distal end of the short arm of sbi- <dig>  on most chromosomes, at least one significant concentration of loci appeared to correspond to the centromeric region , e.g.  <dig> markers co-segregated around the centromeric region of sbi- <dig> and  <dig> markers co-segregated around the centromeric region of sbi- <dig>  the proportion of dart markers in the centromeric regions ranges from  <dig> % on sbi- <dig> to 100% on sbi- <dig>  with an average of  <dig> % across all chromosomes, which reflects the overall proportion of dart markers to non-dart markers on the map.

discussion
the final consensus map comprised  <dig> loci, spanning  <dig>  cm, following the integration of  <dig> individual maps derived from  <dig> distinct ril mapping populations. it has allowed us to map a larger number of markers than possible in any individual map, to obtain a more complete coverage of the sorghum genome and to fill a number of gaps on individual maps. only two other published sorghum genetic linkage maps are of a comparable marker density; the btx623/is3620c map consisting of  <dig> loci spanning  <dig> cm  <cit>  and the btx623/s. propinquum map consisting of  <dig> loci spanning  <dig>  cm  <cit> . while both of these previously published maps have a higher overall marker density than the present dart consensus map;  <dig> marker/ <dig>  cm  <cit> ,  <dig> marker/ <dig>  cm  <cit>  vs.  <dig> marker/ <dig>  cm in the presented consensus map, these maps are based on high numbers of rflp markers  <cit>  or aflp markers  <cit>  and it can be argued that the sequential nature of gel-based marker systems such as rflps and aflps involves high costs and is more labour intensive per assay thus dart markers may represent the most suitable markers for molecular breeding strategies. dart markers, with their high multiplexing level , offer sorghum breeding programs an alternative and low-cost approach to whole-genome profiling and the final consensus map presented here consists predominantly of dart markers , in addition to  <dig> non-dart markers .

the overall consensus map marker order was in good agreement across the individual maps. locally, the consensus map resolution was slightly compromised by occasional inconsistencies in groups of markers, commonly covering about 1– <dig> cm, but also swaps of individual markers over even longer distances. the majority of the  <dig> observed marker order inconsistencies involved closely-spaced markers. inversion is a common feature of closely spaced markers and this phenomenon has been observed previously in sorghum when aligning different sorghum maps  <cit> . these marker order rearrangements could be real, they could be due to error in one of the small mapping populations or they could be explained by the statistical uncertainty of orders at the cm-scale that is inherent in datasets derived from a limited number of rils. of the  <dig> markers in common across all  <dig> maps, in only  <dig> cases did markers map to a truly incongruous location on the corresponding linkage groups in alternative populations, which could be explained by mapping paralogous loci in different populations. a similar 1% frequency of paralogous loci was recently observed by  <cit>  when aligning genetic linkage maps derived from both inter- and intra-specific sorghum populations. such marker ordering inconsistencies are frequently observed for consensus maps and can be related to the overall number and distribution of commonly mapped bridge markers used for building the framework of the consensus map. for constructing the present dart consensus map,  <dig> markers were used as bridge markers  spaced at average intervals of  <dig>  cm. this bridge marker frequency is comparable to other recent consensus map studies, including  <cit>  who used 10% of all markers as bridge markers to construct a consensus map for barley from  <dig> doubled haploid populations.

differences of local recombination frequencies  between populations can also effect marker ordering between maps, and the importance of similar recombination frequencies across individual maps when constructing a consensus map has previously been noted  <cit> . a difference ratio was therefore calculated per chromosome, derived from the equation for the distance measurement of interval variables  <cit>  by  <cit> , to compare the genetic distances on each map with the tamu-ars base map. the overall difference ratios in genetic distance between the tamu-ars map and the five other maps were low and varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>   and were comparable with a recent study  <cit>  that calculated a difference ratio of  <dig>  between two sorghum maps. the low difference ratios observed indicate that there is good agreement in overall distances between common marker pairs across the component maps used in this study. it also provides justification for the "neighbours" consensus map construction strategy adopted here and the use of the tamu-ars genetic distances for the locus positions of the bridge markers along each chromosome. it can also be argued that map distance estimates are less important than marker order, as map distances do vary between different genetic linkage maps by several centimorgans  <cit> , and that the marker order is the most critical feature for further application of the map, for example, for map-based cloning. additionally, the synthetic approach to consensus map development, based on the integration of separately constructed component maps, was recently reported to be the preferable consensus map construction strategy, compared to building a consensus map de novo from an integrated set of segregation data  <cit> , at least until improved or alternative software options become available.

consensus map features
the non-random distribution of markers across the consensus map, due to both clusters and gaps of markers across chromosomes, is a feature that has also been observed in previous sorghum maps. figure  <dig> indicates that there is a clustering of markers around the centromere for every chromosome, with the exception of sbi- <dig>  such marker-dense regions around the centromeres were also observed by  <cit> . this is also supported by the recent observation by  <cit>  that the pericentromeric heterochromatic regions of sorghum chromosomes showed much lower rates of recombination  compared to euchromatic regions , with the average rate of recombination across the heterochromatic portion of the sorghum genome being ~34-fold lower than recombination in the euchromatic region. similarly, the sparseness of markers on the short arm of sbi- <dig> could also be explained by the observations of  <cit>  that this chromosome arm showed a relatively low rate of recombination compared to other regions of euchromatin . both dart and non-dart markers clustered around the centromeres, however a slightly higher overall proportion of dart markers  in these regions were observed. this is in contrast to the recent high-density dart consensus map developed for barley, which  <cit>  found that dart markers were significantly less clustered at most centromeric regions of barley chromosomes compared to non-dart markers. marker redundancy can also enhance the non-random marker distribution pattern. in previous studies  <cit> , a low level of dart marker redundancy has been observed, however during the process of consolidating the most informative dart clones in new arrays, the large majority of redundant markers are excluded from the final dart array, and hence dart marker redundancy should be minimised.

in addition to the uneven distribution of recombination events along chromosomes and the potential for the confounding effects of marker redundancy, non-random marker distribution can also be due to the preferential survey of dna polymorphism that is unevenly distributed along chromosomes. in particular, areas of low marker density may correspond to regions of similar ancestry or identity by descent in the germplasm included in the initial diversity representation for the development of the sorghum dart markers  <cit> . in the present dart consensus maps, there were  <dig> gaps larger than  <dig> cm; one on the distal end of the long arm of sbi- <dig>  one on the distal end of the long arm of sbi- <dig> and one on the distal end of the short arm of sbi- <dig>  these regions of low marker density may therefore be associated with genomic regions that were identical by descent or that had very limited genetic variability in the initial diversity representation used for the development of the dart array. an alternative hypothesis is that because, in total, nine of the twelve parental genotypes of the six mapping populations used in this study were included on the initial diversity representation, the gaps could be a true reflection of co-ancestral regions between the parents, as opposed to a result of the composition of the array, and maybe suggestive of genomic regions containing key adaptive genes which have been fixed through selection through the pedigree. regions of low marker density have been observed previously; even on the densest meiotic linkage map produced yet, for potato  <cit> , a gap spanning  <dig> recombination units was observed. the authors  <cit>  postulate that this could be due either to recombination hot spots or could also indicate fixation  of the potato genome in this region. non-random marker distribution can also be associated with other interesting features of sorghum genome organisation. it has also been noted  <cit>  that sorghum chromosomes have cytologically distinguishable knobs, which may account for some marker excesses or deficiencies.

approximately 75% of the consensus map  was associated with markers which had skewed segregation in one or more of the six component maps. however, only  <dig>  of the  <dig> skewed markers were linked by less than  <dig> cm to other markers showing distortion. the  <dig> markers with skewed segregation that were linked by at least  <dig> cm to markers that weren't distorted could reflect residual levels of heterozygosity in the lines , due to either natural or artificial selection, sampling bias due to lower numbers of markers in these regions or mis-scoring of the markers. skewed segregation was observed for both dart and non-dart markers; no one marker type showed a particular tendency for skewness. marked differences were observed, however, for the distribution of markers with skewed segregation across chromosomes, although there was some similarity between the component maps, e.g. the short arm of sbi- <dig> showed skewed marker segregation in four of the six maps . highly significant deviation from the expected 1: <dig> segregation ratio on sbi- <dig> towards the btx <dig> allele was also observed by  <cit> , which affected almost the entire linkage group. the authors  <cit>  also noted other reports of similar skewed segregation in the same genomic region and observe that strong and consistent segregation distortion in one genomic region is less likely to be due to sampling error and more likely suggests selection favouring one parental allele. on the dart consensus map, sbi- <dig> has the highest proportion of chromosomal regions associated with skewed segregation . two other chromosomes  also have over 50% of the chromosomal regions associated with skewed segregation , once again also observed by  <cit> . sbi- <dig> has a significantly lower portion of the chromosome associated with skewed segregation  than any other chromosome on the consensus map. this non-random and consistent distribution pattern of skewed segregation lends weight to previous proposals  <cit>  that distorted segregation is due to the elimination of gametes or zygotes by a lethal factor located in a neighbouring region of the marker. higher frequencies of skewed markers have also been observed in ril populations, compared to doubled haploid, backcross or f <dig> population structures  <cit> , due to increased opportunities for selection across generations; all six component maps in the current study are based on ril populations.

of the  <dig> markers included in the dart consensus map,  <dig> mapped to different chromosomes in the component maps. the frequency of multicopy markers detected in this study  is much lower than observed by  <cit> , who found that 17% of rflp probes mapped to multiple locations. this could be explained by the differences in marker types. it has been found that darts, as a hybridisation-based bi-allelic marker, inherently select against multi-locus markers  <cit> , as the hybridisation intensities measured for such multi-locus markers tend to appear monomorphic. variation in the frequency of multicopy markers was observed across chromosomes, with sbi- <dig>  sbi- <dig>  sbi- <dig> and sbi- <dig> having a multicopy marker frequency greater than 5%. sbi- <dig> had the lowest multicopy marker frequency . a tendency for the multicopy markers to be present in the centromeric regions across chromosomes was also observed, with approximately 22% of all multicopy markers occurring in the pericentromeric heterochromatic regions, whilst overall only 13% of all markers included in the consensus map are located in the centromeric regions. centromeric suppression of recombination is associated with the accumulation of repeated sequences  <cit>  and could explain the tendency towards marker duplication. the non-random distribution of multicopy loci across chromosome pairs has been reported previously  <cit> . it has been observed  <cit>  that the duplication of sorghum chromatin closely resembles the pattern for rice, showing ancient duplications in some regions. however, very little evidence was found in the current study for co-linearity between chromosomes, lending weight to the argument against an ancient polyploidisation event in the evolution of the sorghum genome  <cit> . it has also been previously observed  <cit>  that 30% of the sorghum genome showed correspondence to two or more unlinked intervals which the authors postulated could either be due to very localised colinearity or which may reflect more recent duplications superimposed on more ancient ones.

utility of the consensus map for genomics and breeding applications
the dart consensus map presented in this paper will help link information on sorghum diversity and qtls to the sorghum physical map and to the sorghum genome sequence. the availability of the primer sequence information for the majority of ssrs  and probe sequence information for a subset of rflp markers with the prefixes bcd, bnl, cdo, csu, psb, rg, rz and umc  included on the consensus map already provides immediate opportunities to anchor the presented consensus map to the physical map, hence faciliating sequence mapping of known genes from other species, taking advantage of known syntenic relationships between sorghum, rice, maize and other grasses  <cit> , in addition to a positional cloning approach to identify candidate genes underlying qtls flanked by sequenced mapped ssrs or rflps. to demonstrate this,  <dig> rflps included on the consensus map were sequence mapped on the rice genome  and bin-mapped on the maize genome ; data presented in additional file  <dig>  the syntenic genomic regions between sorghum, rice and maize were largely as expected, at the macro-level  <cit> . with the recent availability of both the rice and sorghum whole genome sequences, and the on-going sequencing of the maize genome, however, not only the macro-level synteny, but genic microsynteny can now be furthered explored. as an example, comparisons for fifteen predicted genes  in the  <dig>  bp euchromatic region between the two rflp markers rz <dig> and umc <dig> on the sorghum genome  were made between rice and sorghum. blast similarity between the sorghum predicted genes and the rice sequence, requiring hits with e ≤ 1e- <dig> based on blastn, are detailed in additional file  <dig>  over 73% conserved synteny among the  <dig> predicted genes was observed; comparable to microsyntenic levels  observed previously  <cit>  in euchromatic genomic regions in rice and sorghum. far greater microcolinearity has also been observed  <cit>  in euchromatic regions, compared to heterochromatic regions. further detailed evaluation of the level of genic microcolinearity, both in euchromatic and heterochromatic regions, between rice and sorghum based on the whole genome sequence analysis will provide invaluable knowledge for cereal scientists and will provide new opportunities for sorghum researchers to link qtl and gene information aligned to genetic linkage maps directly to the whole genome sequence and predicted genes. the on-going sequencing of the sorghum dart clones, when integrated with the whole genome sequence, offers many opportunities to greatly accelerate gene discovery and analysis in addition to the opportunity to convert the recombination fractions on the consensus map to physical map distances , affording new prospects for the progress of genomic applications. the sorghum whole genome and dart clone sequences can also be exploited for targeted marker development for specific genomic regions. because of ease of sequence analysis, dart markers have a significant advantage over aflps for positional cloning efforts due to the difficulty in sequencing aflps that, therefore, cannot be readily integrated into the whole genome sequence.

an additional use of the presented dart consensus map is in whole genome profiling-assisted breeding. the marker density on the consensus map is sufficient to provide a better choice of markers for specific breeding populations to ensure adequate polymorphic marker coverage in regions of interest. further, the marker density on the consensus map is suitable for whole genome pedigree analysis, and calculating identity-by-descent through generations. the consensus map provides a large number of markers along the length of the chromosome that can be used to genotype individuals for detecting recombinants, fixing loci, restoring a recurrent genetic background, or assembling complex genotypes in complex crosses. the co-location of a range of marker types  on the consensus map will enable sorghum breeders to quickly identify target loci through whole-genome dart scans and then select markers of interest from the same region for marker-assisted selection.

CONCLUSIONS
the integration of six distinct genetic maps into a consensus map has made it possible to obtain a general order and distances for a greater number of markers, and to obtain more complete coverage of the sorghum genome. the consensus map presented here is a good estimation of the marker position from the six component maps. the exact fine marker order may differ slightly in other populations, and users should be prepared to establish the order for closely linked markers in their mapping and breeding populations. the obtained consensus map can be used as a reference map to develop genetic studies in different genetic backgrounds, in addition to providing a framework for transferring genetic information between different marker technologies and for integrating dart markers with other genomic resources.
