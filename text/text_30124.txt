BACKGROUND
post-transcriptional regulatory events govern both the rates of mrna decay and translation, thus controlling the amount of time an mrna can productively interact with ribosomes  <cit> . in mammals, post-transcriptional regulation is primarily encoded by short cis-regulatory elements located in an mrna’s 3′ untranslated region   <cit> . because human 3′utrs have an average length of ~ <dig>  nucleotides, an individual 3′utr has the potential to contain many elements  <cit> . moreover, comparative genomic studies indicate that a large proportion of 3′utr sequence is under selection, and these conserved regions likely correspond to regulatory elements  <cit> . taken together, it is likely that most 3′utrs include multiple regulatory sequences, the majority of which remain to be described. identifying which sequences have functional roles, and the mechanisms by which those sequences act, is required to understand the biology of 3′utrs and the post-transcriptional regulation they mediate.

the predominant trans-factors that interact with 3′utr cis-regulatory elements are micrornas  and mrna binding proteins . micrornas are thought to have consequential target sites in most human genes  <cit> , many of which contain multiple target sites  <cit> . additionally, 3′utrs are known to be extensively bound by a wide variety of mrbps , indicating that transcripts likely contain many discrete post-transcriptional cis-regulatory elements, a conclusion corroborated by detailed studies of individual 3′utrs . importantly, because mirna binding within a 3′utr derives, predominantly, from base-pairing interactions, the systematic identification of mirna target sites is somewhat straightforward  <cit> . in contrast, mrbp recognition of primary sequence and secondary structure in mrnas relies upon each individual protein’s structure and sequence, which have far more diverse biochemical properties than different nucleic acid sequences in small regulatory rnas ; thus, systematic identification of binding sites for even a single rbp requires extensive empirical testing. importantly, although the preferred binding sites for both mirnas and a subset of mrbps are known  <cit> , determining which in vivo sites are functional remains a major challenge.

fluorescence-based screens have been used in a variety of contexts to study gene regulation, including discovery of splice enhancers  <cit> , the impact of codon choice on expression  <cit> , and identification of dna enhancer elements  <cit> . recent work has extended the use of fluorescence-based screens to identify sections of endogenous genes that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression  <cit> . these previous studies focused upon relatively large sections of 3′utrs that likely contained multiple regulatory elements, thus compromising the ability to attribute regulatory impact to discrete elements. nevertheless, it is clear that high-throughput assays facilitate the efficient interrogation and identification of sequences that function in post-transcriptional gene regulation or other regulatory steps.

here, we describe a novel high-throughput screen designed to identify individual 3′utr-encoded functional sequences that direct post-transcriptional regulation. our system exploits integrated dual-fluorophore reporter libraries, in conjunction with fluorescence activated cell sorting , to enrich for cells containing functional sequences within the library. functional elements are then identified using high-throughput sequencing. using this approach, we discovered hundreds of candidate cis-regulatory elements, many with no known trans-acting binding partner. this work provides a powerful new tool to continue to interrogate regulatory information within 3′utrs, and demonstrates that a multitude of cis-regulatory elements within 3′utrs remain to be characterized.

RESULTS
a system for measuring the regulatory impact of many 3′utr sequences in parallel
the post-transcriptional fate of mammalian genes is primarily regulated by sequence elements located within mrna 3′utrs. here, we developed and used a cell-based assay in which the expression of a gfp fluorescent-reporter library, coupled with high-throughput sequencing, acted as a readout for the regulatory potential of short sequences inserted within a reporter 3′utr . these reporter construct libraries were integrated in parallel as a pool into the genomes of hek293-flp cells at a single locus, such that each individual cell received only a single member of the library. after selecting for successful reporter integration, cells exhibiting differential gfp expression, as compared to the overall population of gfp+ cells, were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting . high-throughput sequencing was used to identify the proportion of cells containing each different reporter construct in both the overall cell population and in sub-populations defined by gfp intensity. sequences enriched within gfphigh populations corresponded to candidate activating elements, whereas sequences enriched in gfplow populations were candidate repressive elements.fig.  <dig> experimental design. gfp reporter expression was driven by the ef-1α promoter and potentially modulated by a variable 8mer inserted into the human iqgap <dig> 3′utr. the 5′utr of the gfp reporter contains an intron. expression of dsred was used to control for transcriptional noise at the reporter locus, and was driven by the pgk promoter. the flippase recombination target  site allows this plasmid to undergo site-specific recombination in hek293-trex-flp cells, such that only cells that integrate this construct at the intended locus via the frt site gain hygromycin resistance. after integration, cells with normal transcriptional activity at the reporter locus , and that are potentially undergoing differential post-transcriptional regulation , were isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting . from facs isolated sub-populations, the portion of the 3′utr containing the variable 8mer was pcr amplified, thereby adding illumina adapter sequences, and allowing 8mers in each sorted population to be identified and quantified by illumina sequencing



our screening system was designed to recapitulate endogenous gene structure and expression, incorporating multiple features that enabled the reporter gene to undergo normal mrna synthesis and processing. first, unlike previous high-throughput screens used to test the efficacy of potential post-transcriptional regulatory elements  <cit> , we inserted short random sequences to be assayed within the human iqgap <dig> 3′utr, thus ensuring that the candidates we identified would be functional within an endogenous 3′utr sequence. moreover, we established that exogenous regulatory sequences were capable of mediating regulation at the insertion position by demonstrating that an inserted microrna target site added there elicited the level of repression expected in response to the cognate mirna . second, by using the flp-frt technology, the reporter integrated as a single copy at a defined locus, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio by removing the impact of the integration site on expression. third, because most human genes contain introns  <cit>  and because splicing facilitates subsequent steps in an mrna’s life cycle including export and translation  <cit> , we included an intron within our reporter gene. importantly, while developing our screening strategy, we found that site-specific integration using flp-frt technology occasionally resulted in stochastic yet heritable changes in reporter gene expression. to solve this problem, we co-integrated a second fluorescent reporter, dsred, together with our gfp reporter. measuring dsred expression, therefore, allowed us to greatly improve the performance of our system by excluding cells undergoing differential transcription at the reporter locus . together, these features provided a stringent manner in which to test the post-transcriptional regulatory potential for thousands of sequences in parallel.

discovering novel 3′utr cis-regulatory elements
to discover regulatory sequences in a global and unbiased manner, we first performed a pilot screen, testing a large library of random 8-nucleotide sequences  inserted within the iqgap <dig> 3′utr . we chose 8mers because they are small enough to likely contain at most one regulatory sequence, yet large enough to interact specifically with many mrbps  <cit> . although this screen identified ~ <dig>  putative regulatory elements from the ~ <dig>  assayed , we estimated a false positive error rate of ~50 %, as determined by testing candidate regulatory elements in luciferase reporter assays . to more reliably identify functional 3′utr regulatory elements, we performed a more focused screen in which we included candidates from the pilot screen and other possibly interesting motifs, such as previously identified mrbp binding motifs, together with negative control sequences . importantly, this focused screen incorporated several enhancements to our original approach:  we tested fewer elements , thus increasing the number of independent integration events per tested element;  we sorted a stringent background set of cells, allowing us to determine which 8mers were robustly included in the experiment,  we analyzed populations of cells that span the gfp distribution, rather than the tails of the distribution alone, allowing us to monitor the entire range of post-transcriptional regulation; and  we sorted more cells  per sorted sub-population, providing more replicates per sort. together, these enhancements allowed us to reduce screening noise and produce a robust measure of regulatory potential for each tested 8mer.

we generated > <dig> ×  <dig> cells that underwent independent site-specific integration events from members of our reporter library , corresponding to an average of ~ <dig> independent integration events per motif tested. we used facs to sort all gfp+ cells that fell in a 50 % dsred cutoff  as one background set. to generate a second, more stringent background set, we also sorted the gfp+ cells falling the in the middle 25 % of dsred + cells . in our later analyses, we only included 8mers found in this narrow population, reasoning that such cells had normal transcriptional activity at the reporter locus . we next sorted five cell populations that spanned the range of gfp intensity: 0– <dig>  20– <dig>  40– <dig>  70– <dig>  and 90–100 % , corresponding to a range of intensities ordered from lowest to highest, and isolating only cells that fell within the middle 50 % dsred cutoff . each population was sorted in duplicate, and replicates were maintained separately in all subsequent steps. importantly, three weeks after sorting, the gfp-subset populations exhibited stable changes in gfp intensity that corresponded to the gfp intensities of the cells when they were initially sorted ; replicate sorted populations had concordant gfp intensities . as expected, different gfp populations had near identical dsred expression post-sorting . these results demonstrate that changes in gfp intensity are heritable and that populations of cells can be isolated that have differing reporter gene regulation.fig.  <dig> isolating cells undergoing differential gene regulation. a dsred intensity was measured in cells expressing the reporter construct shown in fig.  <dig>  the cells with the middle 50 % of dsred intensity  were used for subsequent steps; gfp+ cells with the middle 25 % of dsred intensity  were also collected as a stringent background set. b five gfp-positive sub-populations were sorted from the red/gray population in a: 0–10 % , 20–30 % , 40–60 % , 70–80 % , and 90–100 % . for each, 5x <dig> cells were collected, in duplicate. additionally,  <dig> gfp+ cells were sorted and retained . c sorted cells had heritable differences in gfp expression. three weeks after sorting, the populations’ fluorescence were measured via facs. the gfp intensities for the indicated gfp-sub populations  are shown overlaying the gfp intensities for the gfp-all population; the number of cells were normalized to the mode gfp intensity



previously identified regulatory elements are enriched in expected cells populations
reporters with altered gfp expression contain 8mers that alter gene regulation, thus the gfp bin in which an 8mer is enriched predicts the strength of the 8mer’s regulatory effect. to quantify 8mer enrichment in the sorted populations, we isolated dna from all gfp+ cells and from each gfp sub-population. we then amplified the segment of the iqgap <dig> 3′utr containing the 8mers, using a pcr strategy that appended sequences appropriate for multiplexed illumina sequencing . high-throughput sequencing data was obtained for all sorted cell populations. the 8mer counts correlated well between replicate sorting populations ; we used the replicate sorting data to determine which 8mers were robustly included in the background set . we found the proportion of each robustly included 8mer in each gfp+ sub-populations, scaled by its overall abundance in the library . thus, we could determine if an 8mer was enriched or depleted across all gfp+ sub-populations and thereby infer whether the motif was activating, repressive, or had no regulatory effect.

we designed the focused screen to include ten internal control 8mers, whose regulatory effects we had determined previously. five of the ten corresponded to established post-transcriptional cis-regulatory elements; the remaining five were novel elements identified from our pilot screen , which we had subsequently validated . the ten sequences were selected to represent a range of impacts on gene expression; three were repressive, two had no effect in the 3′utr sequence context used here, and five were activating . we determined their regulatory impacts both using luciferase assays , and as individual integrated 8mers assayed using our gfp reporter system . importantly, the regulatory impacts of the ten sequences correlated strongly between transient transfection luciferase assays and integrated gfp reporter measurements .table  <dig> sequences used as internal controls

the level of enrichment of the ten control 8mers in the sorted gfp sub-populations reflected their individually determined activities in reporter assays , indicating the quantitative nature of the screen. for example, agguaagu, which is the most repressive control element, is highly enriched in the lowest gfp intensity bin , slightly enriched in the 20–30 % bin, and depleted in the other bins. guugcauu, which is the most activating control element, had the converse enrichment pattern: it is strongly enriched in the highest gfp intensity bin , at background level in the 70–80 % bin, and depleted in the other bins. elements with no effect were near background level in all bins. importantly, there was near-perfect concordance between the reporter data and the screen data across the ten elements . overall, the enrichment in the low gfp bins  negatively correlated with an element’s gfp intensity, whereas the enrichment in the high gfp bins  positively correlated with gfp intensity , suggesting that a comprehensive score for each 8mer that incorporated the enrichment values across all five bins would provide a semi-quantitative prediction of regulatory impact. together, these data demonstrate that known sequences have the expected performance in this screen, implying that the regulatory effect of novel sequences could also be quantified.

discovering novel post-transcriptional cis-regulatory elements
to quantify function for all sequences tested in our screen, we calculated a score for each element based on its sequencing counts in the five gfp-subset sorting populations. each bin was given a weighted value ; as a result, repressive sequences had negative scores and activating sequences had positive scores, with all scores falling within the range of − <dig> to + <dig>  corresponding to maximally repressive and maximally activating, respectively. the score and relative rank are shown for each sequence tested in the screen . the ten control elements, which are also shown, span the range of possible scores and correspond well with their regulatory effects on gfp intensity .fig.  <dig> identifying 8mers with regulatory potential. a scoring all tested 8mers. an expression score was calculated for each 8mer by multiplying the rpm values in each gfp sub-population by a scaling factor , then normalized by the summed rpm value. each 8mer is plotted by rank  and score . the expression controls are marked in red. b the enrichment of each 8mer in each gfp sub-population was found by dividing its rpm values by the rpm values in gfp+ cells. the enrichment values are ordered by the expression score shown in a. c candidate elements recapitulate their behavior observed in the primary screen. each candidate was inserted into the iqgap <dig> 3′utr-luciferase construct, and the luciferase activity of these reporter constructs were normalized to the geometric means of two expression controls with no regulatory effect . the relative luminescence values  were plotted versus the expression score  for each candidate sequence. expression controls are indicated in red. pearson r =  <dig> , p < 10− <dig>  d the 8mers with scores > <dig> were considered activating elements, and those scores < − <dig> were considered repressive elements. the enrichment for each category of sequences was determined for activating and repressive elements. significance was assessed by two-sided fisher exact tests; *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 



to assess the consistency of our scoring metric, we ordered the 8mers by their score, and examined the relationship between score and the enrichment values we observed in each of the five gfp+ sub-populations . as expected, lowly ranked sequences are enriched in the low gfp bins and depleted in the high gfp bins, while highly ranked sequences have the reciprocal enrichment pattern. sequences that are ranked in the middle are enriched in the 40–60 % sorting bin and depleted in both the very high and very low sorting bins, demonstrating that they likely have little to no effect on post-transcriptional regulation .

to determine how well our screen identified novel regulatory motifs, we selected fifty 8mers with scores ranging from − <dig>  to  <dig>  to validate using luciferase reporter assays. for comparison, we also included the ten control 8mers in these experiments. there was good correlation between each sequence’s score from the screen data and its measured regulatory effect in the luciferase reporter assays , indicating that scores effectively predict an element’s regulatory effect in an orthogonal reporter assay additional file  <dig> 

to determine the sensitivity of the screen, we investigated how the regulatory effects of tested 8mers corresponded to sequences known to mediate post-transcriptional regulation. we defined activating and repressing 8mers from our screen by using expression scores for the control elements. amongst the control elements, the activating sequences uauuuauu, uguaaaga, gugaguuu, and guugcauu all have scores greater than + <dig>  whereas the repressive elements agguaagu and acagggua have scores less than −1; thus, we used those score thresholds on the entire data set, resulting in  <dig> repressive elements and  <dig> activating elements . we observed consistency between our original screen and the focused screen. encouragingly, 8mers that we had previously predicted to be activating were significantly enriched in activating elements in our main screen, and they were depleted from repressive 8mers. similarly, the 8mers that we had previously predicted to be repressive had significant enrichment in elements defined as repressive in the main screen, and they were depleted from activating 8mers .

we next examined specific subclasses of known cis-regulatory elements, including mirna target sites and rbp binding sites, together with conserved motifs. perhaps surprisingly, mirna target sites  were not significantly enriched in repressive sites. this lack of signal may reflect the absence of the cognate mirna in the cells we used and/or the relatively subtle effect mirnas mediate. as determined by mirna profiling in hek293-flp cells, the most abundant mirna is mir- <dig>  and the 8mer corresponding to the mir- <dig> target site was found to be repressive in our screen . it is worth noting that we did find significant depletion of mirna target sites within the set of elements predicted as activating. our screen also included sequences corresponding to the binding sites for certain rna binding proteins ; however, these did not show significant enrichment in either category. we also included elements we found to be frequently conserved within mammalian 3′utrs, which we had anticipated would be repressive because 3′utrs are generally considered negative regulatory sequences  <cit> . these conserved sequences were instead enriched in the set of 8mers our screen predicts as activating sequences, suggesting that many functional post-transcriptional cis-regulatory motifs are positive regulatory sequences.

we repeated our enrichment tests across all categories using a range of cutoffs for active elements; importantly, our results were robust to analyses using these additional cutoffs . additionally, our data suggest that the majority of elements act on rna at the post-transcriptional level because the scores of 8mers that are reverse complement pairs do not positively correlate . moreover, the reverse complements to elements predicted to be functional  are not enriched in activating or repressive sequences, demonstrating they are not functional .

sequence elements often affect mrna stability
post-transcriptional regulation can control gene expression at multiple levels, including predominantly the control of mrna stability and translation. we modified our system to gain insights into the mechanism by which the novel elements we discovered acted, in particular whether elements acted by regulating mrna stability. our sorting data provided protein expression information, whereas sequencing dna from sorted cells provided information regarding the number of cells containing each 8mer. we next quantified each 8mer’s abundance in mrna transcripts produced from the gfp reporter, creating a cdna representation of our reporter library, in addition to the genomic dna derived library . this approach allowed us to quantify relative steady-state rna levels for each reporter within our library and thereby identify elements that resulted in increased or decreased transcript abundances per cell. the level of each 8mer within the cdna library correlated well to its level in genomic dna isolated from the same cells , suggesting that most individual 8mers we tested have relatively small effects on rna abundance, as expected. to examine this relationship further, we normalized rna abundances for each 8mer to its dna abundance , then chose thresholds based on the rna/dna ratio for an 8mer with known effects on mrna stability, the mir- <dig> target site. because mirnas increase the decay rate of their mrna targets  <cit> , this 8mer’s transcript is expected to be destabilized. the log <dig> ratio for acagggua is − <dig> , and so we chose  <dig>  and − <dig>  as the cutoffs for log <dig> ratio score thresholds for elements that potentially alter mrna stability ratios. taking this approach, we found  <dig> 8mers that destabilize their mrnas  and  <dig> that stabilize them .fig.  <dig> rna levels for each sequence correlate to expression score. a the normalized read counts for each 8mer were found in dna  and rna  isolated from gfp-positive cells and gated within the middle 25 % of dsred expression. the mir- <dig> target site is depicted in red. pearson r =  <dig> , p < 10− <dig>  b distribution of rna/dna ratios for all tested 8mers. 8mers with log2 >  <dig>  are shown in orange, and < − <dig>  in blue. c rna abundance for ten control 8mers. rna was isolated and quantified from ten cell lines in which expression control sequences were inserted into gfp and integrated in the genome. shown is the mean of values normalized to that of uuccguua. n = 2; error bars are propagated error from  <dig> technical replicates per biological replicate. normalized rna values  for each 8mer are plotted versus the ratio of rna/dna determined in the screen. the mir- <dig> target site is depicted in red. pearson r =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  d transcript half-lives correlate with rna/dna ratios. cell lines in which individual 8mers were integrated were used to find transcript half-lives. data from 3– <dig> replicates were combined to find half-lives, error bars indicate standard deviation. pearson r =  <dig> . e the expression score  and the rna/dna ratio  are shown for each 8mer. the mir- <dig> target site is depicted in red. pearson r =  <dig> , p < 10−15




to confirm that our approach could reliably determine the relative rna/dna ratio for each 8mer, we tested our ten control sequences individually using qrt-pcr assays. the resulting values correlated well with our high-throughput rna/dna measurements , demonstrating that the rna/dna ratio is an appropriate measurement of steady-state rna for each 8mer. importantly, when we determined the half-lives for five of the mrnas, these also correlated well with the rna/dna ratio , indicating that differences in rna steady-state levels are predominantly due to post-transcriptional regulation.

to explore if 8mers in our screen affected mrna stability or translation rate, we compared the rna/dna ratio, which is a measure of differential rna abundance, to the previously calculated expression scores , which reflect gfp protein abundance. these two values correlated significantly , implying that many sequences regulate protein expression by altering mrna stability. evidence of post-transcriptional regulation via translation rate is seen, however, in those sequences that exhibited low expression scores and high dna/rna ratios, and vice versa. one caveat of this approach is that it cannot distinguish between 8mers that affect stability alone from ones that affect both stability and translation. together, these results demonstrate that high-throughput screens can be adapted to discern mechanistic details of post-transcriptional gene regulation.

predicted candidates regulate endogenous 3′utrs
the regulatory sequences discovered here were identified in the context of a reporter gene with a single human 3′utr. to examine the regulatory impact of these sequences in endogenous contexts, we measured the regulatory impact of eight different 8mers in the context of human 3′utrs in which they are naturally found. three of the 8mers we selected were identified as repressive elements , and five as activating . acagggua, which is the target site of mir- <dig>  a mirna that is highly expressed in hek- <dig> flp cells , was included within the eight as a control. for each, we created multiple luciferase reporter constructs containing ~500 nt of a human 3′utr containing a conserved exemplar of the motif. we generated paired control reporters in which we mutated three of the nucleotides within the 8mer to inactivate the candidate element. the effect of each 8mer in each 3′utr tested was found by comparing its luciferase levels to the corresponding control reporter . reporters monitoring mir- <dig> target sites demonstrated that this element was repressive, as expected, yet only two of the five tested 3′utrs contained detectably functional mir- <dig> sites, confirming previous work showing that the sequence context surrounding bona fide regulatory elements determines their efficacy  <cit> . similarly, the two candidate repressive elements were validated as repressive in some, but not all, native 3′utr contexts. three of the tested activating elements  were able to increase gene expression in certain 3′utr contexts, with only the element gugaguuu functional as an activating sequence in most contexts examined. interestingly, the sequence guugcauu is able to both increase and decrease reporter activity, depending on the 3′utr in which it is found. these results establish that candidate elements discovered from this screen have functional roles in endogenous genes, and are broadly comparable to mirna target sites in terms of the degree of regulation they mediate. moreover, our results highlight the importance of sequence context on the roles of individual sequence elements within 3′utrs.fig.  <dig> motifs found in the screen regulate endogenous 3′utrs. human 3′utrs containing conserved instances of motifs found from the screen were identified. sequences from human, mouse, rat, and dog 3′utrs were aligned, and 3′utrs which contained an intact and orthologous instance of the 8mer in the four species were considered. fragments of ~500 nt of human 3′utrs containing conserved motifs were inserted into luciferase reporter constructs. the candidate motif was mutated at three positions to create a negative control, reasoning that three sequence changes were sufficient to ablate potential function of the original motif. the luciferase activity of constructs containing the intact motif were normalized to the construct with a mutated motif. reporter data are plotted as the geometric mean of relative luminescence  of reporter constructs normalized to those with mutated sites; error bars indicate 68 % of the data. significance was determined by a two-sided wilcoxon rank sum test, n = 6; *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  after bonferonni correction



discussion
in this work, we identified hundreds of novel post-transcriptional cis-regulatory elements using a fluorescence-based, high-throughput, functional cell-based screen. we validated our screen data with orthogonal luciferase reporter assays and found strong agreement between the two readouts. we were able to assign a regulatory impact score to thousands of 8mers that predicted if each 8mer altered gene expression, and if so, if it was activating or repressive. using this approach, we found  <dig> activating and  <dig> repressive elements. interestingly, 8mers with preferential conservation in 3′utrs were enriched in activating elements, suggesting that many functional post-transcriptional cis-regulatory elements act to increase gene expression. in a parallel complementary high-throughput screen, we established that the majority of functional 8mers we found acted by altering mrna stability. finally, we confirmed that a sample of 8mers identified in our screen were functional in native 3′utr contexts, demonstrating that our method discovered bona fide cis-regulatory elements. these results, therefore, suggest that 3′utrs contain many short cis-regulatory elements that together determine the post-transcriptional fate of an mrna.

our approach complements other related studies that also measured the effect of 3′utr sequences on gene expression  <cit> . the goal of these previous studies was to identify larger, and perhaps structured, elements within native sequence contexts; thus, the regulatory impacts of larger regions of 3′utrs were assayed, focusing on conserved sequences. these studies provided important insights into post-transcriptional regulation but were not designed to determine the effects of individual regulatory elements. these approaches, however, are well suited to identifying regulatory elements that incorporate structured rna. in contrast, our approach instead found individual cis-regulatory elements by measuring the effects of sequences that are short enough to interact with one protein domain that binds single-stranded rna, such as an rna recognition motif or kh domain  <cit> . by focusing on such short sequences, we hoped to define discrete cis-regulatory elements, and indeed, we found hundreds of 8mers that exert regulatory effects and presumably interact with rna binding proteins. currently, the relative importance and frequency of short sequence elements versus structured 3′utr elements in mediating post-transcriptional regulation is unknown. it is clear that further understanding of post-transcriptional regulatory sequences will benefit from combining multiple approaches, including functional screens, such as our system, with approaches such as clip-seq that identify mrna binding sites of rbps.

because post-transcriptional gene regulation is primarily encoded within 3′utrs, it is important to determine how many cis-regulatory elements are present and functional in each 3′utr. most human genes include conserved target sites of multiple mirnas  <cit> , but the data for motifs that interact with rbps are less clear, due to lack of knowledge of their preferred binding sequences. global clip studies have been used to identify all positions in mrnas that cross-link to proteins ; however, these sites are often not functional  <cit> . it is thus difficult to determine how rna binding proteins affect post-transcriptional regulation of individual 3′utrs. combining clip data with comparative genomics approaches is useful in that it allows partitioning by evolutionary conservation  <cit> . the data reported here, as well in other studies that have performed functional experiments in 3′utrs  <cit> , demonstrate that there are indeed many sequences that act as cis-regulatory elements in 3′utrs. moreover, a detailed study performed on a single 3′utr identified many discrete cis-regulatory elements, which had additive effects on expression  <cit> . each 3′utr having many cis-regulatory elements could potentially allow the cell to respond to environmental signaling by altering expression of rna binding proteins, thus amplifying an mrna’s repression or activation when necessary.

a growing body of evidence implies that the efficacy of a cis-regulatory element depends upon surrounding 3′utr sequence context. in particular, it is clear that the efficacy of mirna targeting is dependent on multiple local and global characteristics of the 3′utr sequence  <cit> . our validation experiments with endogenous 3′utrs demonstrate that sequence context also influences the efficacy of regulatory sites we found. because all mirnas have a similar structure and interact with the same complement of proteins, whereas each rna binding domain uses different structural properties to recognize their cognate motifs, the rules governing rbp accessibility are likely quite variable. further screens and other high-throughput approaches, including clip-seq  <cit> , could be used to directly test the importance of sequence context by systematically examining the influence of local sequence context on cis-regulatory elements.

global studies investigating alternative cleavage and polyadenylation have found that shorter 3′utr isoforms often, although not exclusively, correlate with increased gene expression  <cit> . one interpretation of these results is that 3′utrs predominantly consist of repressive elements, and longer 3′utr isoforms are more likely to accumulate increasing numbers of repressive elements, such as mirna binding sites. it is worth noting, however, that mirna binding sites tend to lose their efficacy in long 3′utrs  <cit> . interestingly, many of the cis-regulatory elements within the hmga <dig> 3′utr, one of the few 3′utrs for which a detailed accounting of regulatory sequences has been undertaken, act by increasing gene expression  <cit> . our current work is in agreement with the hmga <dig> study; we found more 8mers that had an activating rather than repressive effect on gene expression. importantly, activating 8mers include those that are preferentially conserved in 3′utrs, and such conservation strongly implies that these sequences have functional roles in endogenous genes. interestingly, 3′utr length itself has been suggested as repressive, independent of the presence of specific regulatory elements  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that the connection between 3′utr size and repressive activity is more intricate than previously appreciated. nevertheless, our results clearly imply that activating elements are relatively common in mammalian 3′utrs.

CONCLUSIONS
we used a cell-based fluorescence screen to discover hundreds of novel post-transcriptional cis-regulatory elements that can alter gene regulation. because the vast majority of these sequences are not complementary to mirnas expressed in the cell type we used, we expect that they mediate expression by interacting with rna binding proteins. additionally, most of the regulatory 8mers we identified increase gene expression, reinforcing their independence from mirna-mediated effects. the cis-regulatory elements we discovered are functional within endogenous 3′utrs. because we found hundreds of regulatory 8mers, these results suggest that each human 3′utr is regulated by many cis-regulatory elements. thus, it is clear that in many regards, our understanding of the regulatory language of 3′utrs remains in its infancy.
