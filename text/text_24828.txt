BACKGROUND
plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria can be exploited in agriculture as an environmentally friendlier alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which often pollute the environment . such bacteria naturally inhabit plant roots and the surrounding soil , where they utilize plant-derived nutrients while benefiting the plant through a variety of direct or indirect mechanisms  <cit> . direct mechanisms can include fixing atmospheric nitrogen, solubilizing mineral phosphates , synthesizing phytohormones such as indole-3-acetic acid  that are readily taken up by plant roots, and enhancing plant tolerance to abiotic stress through lowering host ethylene levels by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  deaminase activity . indirect mechanisms of plant-growth promotion include inhibition of phytopathogens, induction of plant systemic resistance against pathogens, stabilization of soil aggregates, and maintenance of soil nutrients and structure  <cit> .

the plant-growth promoting rhizobacterium paenibacillus polymyxa has attracted considerable attention because of the demonstrated abilities of its various strains to encourage crop growth via one or more mechanisms, as well as produce lignocellulose-modifying enzymes  <cit>  which could contribute to in situ degradation of crop residues that are often burnt, affecting air quality and public health  <cit> . among the most studied strains, p. polymyxa sqr- <dig> and e <dig> are known primarily for their ability to suppress plant disease  <cit> , while p. polymyxa p2b-2r promotes plant growth by fixing nitrogen  <cit> .

comparative genomic analyses of multiple strains reveal that p. polymyxa gene clusters encoding antimicrobial peptides are structurally and functionally diverse, perhaps having been acquired by horizontal transfer from other species  <cit> . genes that encode enzymes involved in lignocellulose degradation are also somewhat variable among strains  <cit> , and while all studied strains have putative genes for phosphate solubilization and production of the plant hormone iaa, only a few contain the nif gene cluster required for nitrogen fixation  <cit> . to our knowledge, no single p. polymyxa strain has yet been described in which all five of these advantageous traits have been confirmed in vivo .

while the recently sequenced genome of p. polymyxa cr <dig> suggests that this strain has all of the mentioned traits  <cit> , studies have not yet been published confirming these abilities. the current work therefore describes the isolation of p. polymyxa cr <dig> from degrading corn roots, its in vitro antagonistic activities against common plant pathogens, and its ability to promote growth of important agricultural crops. we further confirm the capability of this strain to fix atmospheric nitrogen fixation, utilize inorganic phosphate, produce the plant hormone iaa, and degrade the major components of lignocellulose.

RESULTS
species identification

p. polymyxa strain cr <dig> was isolated from degrading corn roots and named based on phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic characterization, where cr <dig> is for “corn rhizobacterium 1”. p. polyxyxa cr <dig> formed hard, sticky colonies when grown on 1/ <dig> npt agar, exhibiting a translucent to white-yellow color. phylogenetic analysis was based on the 16s rrna gene sequenced in this work and deposited in genbank . the 16s rrna gene was aligned against the ncbi nucleotide database using blastn, showing 99 % identity to sequences from p. polymyxa strains e <dig> , sc <dig>  and m <dig>  identity to sequences from other paenibacillus species was lower, e.g. 94 % identity to paenibacillus validus , 93 % to paenibacillus koreensis , and 93 % to paenibacillus larvae . these 16s rrna gene sequences, along with those from other relevant bacteria, were used to construct a phylogenetic tree .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of bacterial 16s rrna sequences revealing p. polymyxa evolutionary divergence. manually refined 16s rrna sequences were aligned using mega  <dig> and the tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method . bootstrap values are indicated at tree branching points. p. polymyxa strains cr <dig> and e <dig>  in reference to all p. polymyxa strains, are considered to be monophyletic, while remaining closely related to m <dig>  sc <dig> and atcc  <dig> strains




antagonistic activity against microbial pathogens
a total of  <dig> bacterial colonies were isolated from degrading corn roots and further screened for antagonism against pathogenic microorganisms using a dual-culture technique. of the tested isolates,  <dig> demonstrated growth antagonism towards at least one phytopathogen. p. polyxyxa cr <dig>  referred to as “antifungal b” prior to species identification, grew rapidly compared to the other eleven isolates  and exhibited antagonism toward six tested pathogens : phytophthora sojae p <dig> , rhizoctonia solani  <dig> , cylindrocarpon destructans  <dig> ; and the bacteria pseudomonas syringae dc <dig> , xanthomonas campestris 93- <dig> , and bacillus cereus bcmor <dig> . it did not affect growth of agrobacterium tumefaciens, the causal agent of crown gall disease . these pathogens were tested because of their phylogenetic diversity, relevance, and availability in our lab. the observations suggest that p. polyxyxa cr <dig> produces considerable amounts of anti-microbial substances that antagonize the growth of a broad range of microbial pathogens.fig.  <dig> in vitro antagonistic activity of p. polymyxa cr <dig> against selected pathogens. dual culture assay tests show zones of inhibition which indicate antagonistic activity against a

various strains of p. polymyxa have previously been found to antagonize microorganisms related to some of the ones tested here, including phytophthora species  <cit> , r. solani  <cit> , p. syringae  <cit> , and x. campestris  <cit> . in some cases, responsible antimicrobial compounds have been identified: fusaricidin against phytophthora capsici  <cit> , a ~35 kda antifungal peptide against r. solani  <cit> , and gavaserin and saltavalin against x. campestris  <cit> . notably, not all strains of p. polymyxa are antagonistic toward these organisms  <cit> , an observation which is consistent with the diversity among strains in their gene clusters that encode antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . the specific antimicrobial compounds produced by p. polymyxa cr <dig> are yet to be identified.

plant growth promotion 
inoculation of plants with p. polymyxa cr <dig> resulted in increased plant growth relative to controls . inoculation of maize lead to a 19 % ±  <dig>  % sd increase in whole-plant dry weight versus the mock-inoculated control after 8 weeks. in comparison, maize plants inoculated with gluconacetobacter azotocaptans ds <dig>  an established growth-promoting rhizobacterium  <cit> , lead to a 13 % ±  <dig>  % sd increase in dry weight versus the control. inoculation with either bacterium appeared to enhance development of maize roots . potato plantlets inoculated with p. polymyxa cr <dig> were 16 % ±  <dig>  % sd taller than control plantlets after four weeks . inoculation with p. polymyxa cr <dig> led to a 27 % ±  <dig>  % sd increase in cucumber shoot fresh weight after four weeks , a 25 % ±  <dig>  % sd increase in arabidopsis thaliana col- <dig> dry weight after three weeks , and a 27 % ±  <dig>  % sd increase in tomato shoot dry weight after six weeks , relative to the controls.fig.  <dig> plant growth promotion by p. polymyxa cr <dig>  a corn plants inoculated by seed soaking with p. polymyxa cr <dig> in reference to an established growth promoting rhizobacterium, gluconacetobacter azotocaptans ds <dig>  <cit>  and control plants. bottom panel indicates increases density of root formation. b tissue-culture potato plantlets grown as single-node explants following inoculation with p. polymyxa cr <dig> culture, and control plantlets. c cucumber plants inoculated at the stem base with p. polymyxa cr <dig>  and control plants. d

beneficial rhizobacteria can promote plant growth through bacterial nitrogen fixation, iaa hormone production, phosphorus solubilization, or by protecting plants from phytopathogens  <cit> , such as the ones studied above. our experiments with maize, cucumber, and tomato were conducted in non-sterile soil in a greenhouse. however, the experiments with potato and a. thaliana were in soil-free media with agar. while these latter results may not be representative of effects in nature , they do provide evidence of growth promotion due to direct effects of p. polymyxa cr <dig> inoculation, rather than indirect effects on other rhizosphere microbes. therefore, factors other than pathogen antagonism, such as iaa production, phosphate solubilization and nitrogen fixation, were expected to have collectively contributed to the observed growth promotion.

nitrogen fixation
the vegetative growth of plants  is especially dependent on nitrogen fertilizer  <cit> . the nitrogen-fixing potential of p. polymyxa cr <dig> was therefore assessed by growth on nitrogen-free minimal medium . growth of p. polymyxa cr <dig> was visible on the nfm, while escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  which does not fix nitrogen, grew only on medium supplemented with reactive nitrogen . these results demonstrate the ability of p. polymyxa cr <dig> to fix nitrogen, which is not surprising given the presence in the p. polymyxa cr <dig> genome of the nif gene cluster  <cit>  that is sufficient to confer nitrogen fixation to escherichia coli  <cit> .fig.  <dig> nitrogen-fixation by p. polymyxa cr <dig>  p. polymyxa cr <dig> inoculated on nitrogen free media  was assessed for growth in reference to non-nitrogen fixing e. coli o157:h <dig>  a nfm medium; b nfm supplemented with 5 mm nh4cl; c the presence of nitrogen fixing genes. primer pairs polf and polr were utilized to amplify 352 bp of the nifh gene from four single colonies of the same p. polymyxa cr <dig> strain , or in a pcr reaction control without dna . presence of a nif gene cluster was confirmed by dna sequencing




nitrogen fertilizers are routinely applied to crops to ensure growth and productivity. however, more than half of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is not taken up by crops, instead being lost to the environment where it contributes to greenhouse gas production, acid rain, and biodiversity loss in aquatic systems  <cit> . these detrimental effects could be lessened by inoculating fields with nitrogen-fixing rhizobacteria, allowing for partial replacement of synthetic fertilizers. accordingly, p. polymyxa cr <dig> may be able to contribute to the bio-fertilization of a variety of crops.

phosphorus solubilization
like nitrogen, phosphorus is another major essential macronutrient for plant growth, health and productivity  <cit> . phosphate based fertilizers  are routinely applied to soil in agricultural practice. however, applied phosphate fertilizer is rapidly immobilized through precipitation reaction with highly reactive fe3+, aluminum and calcium in soil and consequently becomes unavailable to plants  <cit> . soil erosion also leads to phosphorus loss from soils, which usually accumulates in lakes and rivers causing eutrophication. microbe-mediated phosphorus solubilization is one of the most important traits relevant to plant growth promotion .


p. polymyxa cr <dig> was assessed for its ability to solubilize and utilize inorganic phosphate in the form of tricalcium phosphate . after two weeks of incubation, clear and visible dissolution halos formed around a p. polymyxa cr <dig> colony grown on solid nbrip medium, in which ca <dig> is the sole phosphate source . these dissolution halos indicate the excretion of organic acids or enzymes into the surrounding medium that solubilize ca <dig>  the results therefore suggest an ability to solubilize inorganic phosphate to a form available for plants, although they do not necessarily imply phosphate solubilisation in nature.fig.  <dig> inorganic phosphate solubilization by p. polymyxa cr <dig>  cr <dig> was immobilized on nbrip plates as described in materials and methods. cr1’s capacity to solubilize and use ca <dig> as a sole source of phosphate was evident as a clearing zone around cr <dig> inoculum




indole  <dig> acetic acid  production
another way that rhizobacteria can promote plant growth is through synthesis of the phytohormone iaa , which plays a multifaceted role in plant growth and development. iaa stimulates plant cell elongation and cell division, increasing root size and distribution which leads to greater nutrient absorption from the soil  <cit> . appropriate concentrations of exogenous iaa or iaa agonists also stimulate the growth and development of plant root systems by activating root branching and lateral root development  <cit> .

the ability of p. polymyxa cr <dig> to synthesize iaa was determined by reaction of liquid culture with salkowski’s reagent, which detects iaa and its intermediates  <cit> . the reaction produces a proportionate amount of tric- iron  complex, which is pink in color and can be quantified by measuring absorbance at 535 nm. p. polymyxa cr <dig> produced an average of  <dig>  μg/ml ±  <dig>  μg/ml sd of iaa  when grown with 500 mg/l l-tryptophan  in liquid mgn or npt medium . the difference in iaa production between mgn and npt medium, with or without tryptophan, was not significant. the genomes of many plant growth promoting bacteria, including p. polymyxa  <cit> , encode a transaminase for the oxidative deamination of l-tryptophan to yield indole-3-pyruvic acid as an intermediate for iaa production. as expected, significantly more iaa  was produced in media with tryptophan than without , indicating that p. polymyxa cr <dig> utilizes this tryptophan-dependent pathway.table  <dig> indole-3-acetic-acid  production by p. polymyxa cr <dig> grown in various media




degradation and utilization of lignin, cellulose and hemi-cellulose
in addition to its growth promoting properties, p. polymyxa is known to produce a variety of lignocellulose-modifying enzymes  <cit>  which can be used in a variety of applications. the ability of p. polymyxa cr <dig> to utilize hemicellulose was confirmed by growth on minimal medium supplemented with xylan . p. polymyxa cr <dig> was grown on minimal medium supplemented with methylene blue, a lignin mimetic, to detect ligninolytic enzyme activity  <cit> . the oxidation zone  around the colony  is indicative of lignin metabolism. cellulose degradation was confirmed by cultivation with carboxymethylcellulose and congo red, which stains the un-degraded substrate  <cit> , producing a concentric yellow opaque zone of clearing around the colony . our recent genome sequencing confirmed the presence of genes encoding extensive plant cell wall-degrading machinery in the cr <dig> genome including endoglucanases, cellodextrinases, xylanases, mannanases, arabinofuranosidase, dyp-peroxidase, and laccase  <cit> .fig.  <dig>

lignocellulose-degrading bacteria can contribute to nutrient cycling in untilled land by promoting biological decomposition of residues from non-harvested plant parts. lignocellulose-modifying p. polymyxa cr <dig>  or its isolated enzymes, could also be studied for their potential use in biomass delignification or carbohydrate deconstruction by the biofuels industry. as part of the process for conversion of lignocellulose to fuel or value-added bio-products, it could contribute to a reduced dependency on petrochemicals  <cit> . to better assess this potential, enzymatic activities  will need to be quantitatively assessed under industrially-relevant conditions, and if justified, optimal fermentation conditions need to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS

p. polymyxa cr <dig> possesses several beneficial properties and enhances growth of a variety of important plants. like most studied strains of p. polymyxa, it has the ability to produce the beneficial plant hormone iaa and to solubilize inorganic phosphorous. it is also able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, a trait that is shared by only a select few of the species. furthermore, while each strain presumably antagonizes a unique set of microorganisms, p. polymyxa cr <dig> showed antagonistic activity toward key plant pathogens that are phylogenetically diverse. in addition, the strain was shown to utilize and degrade the main components of lignocellulose. to our knowledge, this is the first time that a single p. polymyxa strain has demonstrated all of these advantageous traits.

due to the multiple beneficial effects of p. polymyxa cr <dig>  this strain could be developed and commercially formulated, either alone or as part of microbial consortia, for field application in order to control pathogens, promote crop growth, and degrade crop residues after harvest. further research is needed to establish optimum growth parameters of p. polymyxa cr <dig>  determine factors influencing its competitiveness in soil, and confirm these benefits in field trials.
