BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  is the causative agent of paratuberculosis, a chronic digestive disease affecting mainly bovine, ovine, caprine and cervine livestock. although the aetiology of crohn's disease has been subject of strong controversy  <cit> , recent information seems to confirm an association between map and this chronic human disease  <cit> . this underlines the increasing interest the research of map has gained during last years due to the worldwide distribution of paratuberculosis, to the economic losses attributed to this disease  <cit> , and to the presence of viable bacteria in products ready for human consumption  <cit>  as a potential hazard in relationship with human inflammatory bowel disease. successful control strategies require a good understanding of the epidemiology of a disease. strain differentiation is a useful tool in epidemiological studies of many pathogenic bacteria. but previous investigations have revealed a relative lack of genetic diversity amongst map isolates . combined with the slow growth of the organism in pure culture, strain differentiation among isolates has proved to be difficult and has limited the study of the molecular epidemiology of paratuberculosis. pcr based methods can interestingly reduce the amount of bacteria and time required for map strain typing. we here compare for the first time a set of  <dig> isolates from different hosts  that have been previously characterized for is <dig> pcr-restriction endonuclease analysis and snabi-spei pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  patterns  <cit>  with the more recently described short sequence repeat  analysis of locus  <dig> and locus  <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
the results of ssr typing undertaken in the present work are summarized in table  <dig>  these results show that a total of nineteen different ssr1_ssr <dig> types were identified amongst the  <dig> isolates. in terms of host species distribution, there were  <dig> ssr types identified from cattle,  <dig> from sheep and  <dig> from goat isolates. amongst isolates recovered from spain, ssr type 7_ <dig> accounted for the  <dig> % of cattle isolates, while types 7_ <dig> and 14_ <dig> accounted for the 29% of sheep isolates each. interestingly, amongst isolates recovered from goats, approximately the same proportion  of isolates was typed as either cattle type 7_ <dig> or sheep type 14_ <dig>  the remaining  <dig> % of goat isolates were also sheep type strains and were identified as 9_ <dig> type in ssr. both deer and wild boar isolates belonged to the widest distributed type 7_ <dig>  in contrast they were {68-1} and {2-1} profiles in pfge, respectively. genetic homogeneity of map isolates has been previously pointed out by other researchers using different typing methods  <cit> . similarly and in agreement with our results, ssr method has demonstrated predominant type 7_ <dig> to account for more than half the strains analyzed in previous studies  <cit> . the combination of ssr and pfge types found in the present work made the prevalence of the most abundant genotype  drop down to  <dig> %. none of the remaining combined types showed prevalences over 10%, except the combined type 14_5&{1-1}. the latter corresponds to the type assigned to map k <dig> strain and it was found in  <dig> % of isolates under study. the amount of isolates showing particular genotypes in both techniques is graphically represented in figure  <dig> 

ssr types by region and host species. name of ssr type: number of repeats in locus  <dig>  _ number of repeats in locus  <dig> . is <dig> pcr-rea classification of isolates is also included. percentages in brackets are calculated according to the total number of isolates in each host species. regions mentioned in the study are indicated as follows: an = andalucia; ar = arag칩n; as = asturias; bc = basque country; can = cantabria; cat = catalu침a; cl = castilla y le칩n; cm = castilla-la mancha; ex = extremadura; ga = galicia; ib = balearic islands; ma = madrid; na = navarra.

cluster analysis with both pfge and ssr based typing methods  confirmed that map isolates are genetically divided into the cattle type and sheep type main groups, much as has been found in other works  <cit> . the agreement between this classification and the is <dig> groups c  and s confirms the utility of is <dig> pcr-rea as a rapid and reliable method for preliminary typing of map isolates, as indicated by results of previous works  <cit> .

while the overall discriminatory power of both methods as calculated by simpson's index of diversity  was almost the same , comparative analysis revealed that the most abundant pfge {1-1}, {2-1} and {54-49} profiles  were subdivided into  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> different types, respectively. similarly, isolates representing the most abundant ssr type 7_ <dig>  could be subdivided into  <dig> different pfge profiles as shown in table  <dig>  as was to be expected, the overall 1-d value raised up to  <dig>  if calculated considering the abundances of combined ssr and pfge types . other promising methods as the mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units/variable number tandem repeats  seem to have a high discriminatory power as well  <cit> . amongst isolates recovered from sheep, there was a higher discrimination with pfge  than with ssr , but such a difference was not noticed in the other host species .

estimation of the genetic diversity of isolates from spanish cattle, sheep and goats, and the discriminatory power of both methods calculated as simpson's index of diversity . discriminatory power of the combined ssr&pfge method was calculated taking into account all combinations found amongst map isolates studied.

the polyclonal infection of one holstein bull with three different strains earlier demonstrated by pfge  <cit>  was partially confirmed by ssr1_ssr <dig> typing. the isolate typed as {1-1} with pfge was of 13_ <dig> type by ssr, but the remaining two isolates classified as pfge profiles {2-1} and {59-63} shared the same ssr type 7_ <dig>  none of the fingerprinting methods compared here detected any other polyclonal infections in the other three animals with more than one culture available included in the study. in general terms, ssr1_ssr <dig> analysis seemed to detect higher levels of within-herd strain variability than snabi-spei pfge. with  <dig> bovine farms giving more than one isolate, ssr method used detected  <dig> farms with multi-type isolates, one farm with isolates belonging to five different types, two farms yielded isolates of four different types, another one gave isolates of  <dig> types, and finally  <dig> of these herds had isolates of two distinct ssr types . on the other hand, pfge typing detected up to  <dig> farms with multi-type isolates, three bovine herds with three different profiles and  <dig> herds carrying strains of two different profiles. combination of both typing methods revealed  <dig> multi-type cattle farms. more than one isolate was recovered from four sheep flocks. in this case, a slightly higher level of intra-herd variability was detected by pfge compared to ssr. three flocks with  <dig> different strains were found by pfge while ssr analysis identified two flocks with  <dig> different types and one flock with two.

farms with more than one isolate giving at least two different strain types in ssr and/or pfge typing. ssr detected  <dig> multi-type bovine herds and  <dig> multi-type sheep flocks. in the other hand, pfge identified  <dig> and  <dig> multi-type farms, respectively. farm names indicate the name of the province  they belong to: bi = bizkaia ; ss = gipuzkoa ; s = cantabria ; bu = burgos ; va = valladolid ; na = navarra ; o = asturias ; sa = salamanca ; z = zaragoza . other abbreviations: as = asturias; bc = basque country; can = cantabria; cl = castilla y le칩n; na = navarra; bov = bovine; ov = ovine.

a previous work suggested an apparent relation between particular g residue repeat alleles and host species in ssr analysis  <cit> . in the present study the previously described alleles 7g to 14gs have been found, but 8gs, 9gs and 11gs are almost restricted to isolates obtained from cattle. interestingly, there seems to be a strong link between ggt residue alleles and host species. thus, allele 3ggts has been detected in all sheep  and in 67% of goats while all cows analyzed were infected with strains showing  <dig> or 5ggts repeats. possession of 3ggt allele resembles possession of a cytosine at base pair position  <dig> that can be found in all copies of the is <dig> gene of typical sheep  type strains of map  <cit> .

the study of ssr1_ssr8/snabi-spei pfge combined profiles from herds giving more than one isolate according to the date of cultures demonstrated the reliability and usefulness of these techniques for epidemiological tracing of paratuberculosis cases. eleven holstein farms giving at least two isolates from different years were identified. the ssr method appeared to give slightly higher year-related information. as shown in table  <dig>  strain type changed along the years during the follow-up period in farms ss <dig>  ss <dig>  ss <dig>  ss <dig> and ss <dig> . on the contrary, farms bi <dig>  bi <dig>  hu <dig>  le <dig> and na <dig> maintained the same strain types year after year. herd ss <dig> showed an intermediate situation since it yielded two types in the first year, but maintained one of them afterwards. further conclusions cannot be suggested due to a lack of information. a strain variation percentage was calculated for each of these farms dividing the number of different strain types minus one by the total number of isolates recovered minus one. thus a 100% strain variation was observed for the first  <dig> farms while the last four showed no variation . ss <dig>  ss <dig>  na <dig> and ss <dig> showed intermediate strain variations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 10%, respectively. collectively, our results indicate that ssr1_ssr <dig> analysis, helped by snabi-spei pfge where possible, can offer very valuable epidemiologic information and indicate the existence of three models of strain type change in infected populations: stable, variable and intermediate. no obvious difference in the incorporation of new animals to the herd was observed between the different types of farms but the information on other management factors was very scarce. however, for the first time it has been shown that epidemiological patterns can vary according to cattle population and time. this observation requires further research by broadening the number of farms and extending the period of observation, as well as recording factors that might influence the strain shifting and determine its consequences in terms of severity of the disease, control measures effects and bacteria sources and reservoirs.

new strains turning up and within-herd spread of specific strains during time in some bovine holstein farms as assessed by ssr/pfge analysis combination. strain variation along time seems to indicate three different epidemiologic situations: farms with 100% strain variation , farms with intermediate strain variation  and farms carrying always the same types .

CONCLUSIONS
these independent typing methods are in general agreement. however, they showed significant discrepancies indicating that each one might reflect differing evolutionary processes of map strains. since both ssr1_ssr <dig> and snabi-spei pfge methods have the ability to reciprocally complement their results by subdividing the different genotypes identified in the other method, none of them should be used as a substitute for the other one if sufficient bacterial growth is available. taken together, the results of our studies confirm the utility of the ssr approach as an easy and rapid method based on pcr and sequence analysis that requires only small amounts of sample to perform, compared to the big amount and good quality of dna required for pfge typing. the results also suggest that the addition of a third locus to ssr1_ssr <dig> typing may help in increasing the discriminatory power of this method. overall, the results of our comparative analyses suggest that, based on current methodologies available, a combined approach that includes is <dig> pcr-rea, ssr and pfge provides the highest level of discrimination for map strain characterization. however, in practical terms, the use of is <dig> pcr-rea is not equivalent to the other two since it only provides broad group classification. the choice between pfge and ssr, however, will be defined for the technical simplicity, lower dna quality and quantity requirements and robustness for obtaining reliable epidemiologic information of ssr.
