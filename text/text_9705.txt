BACKGROUND
schizosaccharomyces pombe is a widely used model organism for analysis of important cellular functions  <cit> . the use of conditional inactivation by mutations or depletion of proteins in vivo has been used successfully for analysis of gene functions. a conditional protein degradation system, so-called "degron", which depletes proteins from cells, is a powerful tool for analyzing the "null" phenotype of various genes. in budding yeast, a heat-inducible degron  system has been devised  <cit>  and used for studies of essential gene functions  <cit> . in fission yeast, the ts-degron mutant of bir <dig>  a nuclear protein involved in mitotic segregation, has been reported to cause destruction of the protein, resulting in growth defects at restrictive temperature  <cit> . for functional analysis, however, as this system is unable to deplete proteins sufficiently to arrest the cell cycle, it is often combined with ts-alleles of the genes of interest  <cit> .

recently, an auxin-inducible degron  system was developed for use in budding yeast and higher eukaryotic cells  <cit> . this strategy involves a plant-specific mechanism that relies on response to the plant hormone auxin and a conserved poly-ubiquitination pathway involving the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, scf  complex  <cit> . in plant cells, auxin binds to transport inhibitor response  <dig>  protein  <cit>  and promotes binding of the scftir <dig>  a form of scf containing tir <dig>  to aux/iaa transcription repressors  <cit> . the aux/iaa proteins are poly-ubiquitinated by the scftir <dig> and then degraded by proteasomes  <cit> . except for the auxin-dependent recognition of aux/iaa proteins by tir <dig>  components of the scf and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, especially f-box interacting protein skp <dig>  are conserved among eukaryotes. this makes it possible to form the scftir <dig> in non-plant cells by expression of tir <dig> and to degrade aux/iaa-tagged proteins depending on addition of auxin.

we have constructed an aid system for use in s. pombe by expressing tir <dig>  although mcm <dig> protein fused with aux/iaa peptide  at the c-terminus  was decreased upon addition of auxin, the strain did not show any obvious growth defect because of inefficient depletion. here we describe an improved form of the aid system. depletion of mcm4-aid protein was greatly enhanced by expression of skp1-tir <dig>  a fusion protein comprising plant tir <dig> and fission yeast skp <dig>  this i-aid system  was applicable for depletion of other essential replication proteins including orc <dig>  cdc <dig> and pol <dig>  furthermore, in conjunction of the i-aid system with transcription repression , cdc45- or pol1-depleted cells showed severe replication defects resulting in cell cycle arrest. the off-aid system involving two-step gene modifications will be a powerful tool for analyzing the function of essential genes under null conditions in s. pombe.

RESULTS
auxin-dependent degradation of mcm4-aid in fission yeast
to develop an auxin-inducible protein degradation system in fission yeast, we constructed a strain that expresses arabidopsis thaliana tir <dig> , a plant specific f-box protein that binds auxin, from the chromosome. we placed the attir <dig> gene under control of the nmt <dig>  promoter to induce gene expression in the absence of thiamine  <cit> . as a target of degradation, we used mcm <dig>  a component of the mcm complex, which is required throughout the whole process of chromosomal dna replication. the mcm4-aid, tagged with full-length iaa <dig>  at the c-terminus of the mcm4+ gene on the chromosome, grew as well as the wild-type strain without the aid-tag . the level of mcm4-aid protein analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-mcm <dig> antibody was similar to that in the untagged strain . upon addition of a synthetic auxin, naa , to log-phase cells expressing attir <dig>  the protein level of mcm4-aid decreased in  <dig> h . the amount of protein at  <dig> h was estimated to be about 25% of that without auxin . to examine whether reduction of mcm4-aid protein affects dna replication and cell growth, the dna content was analyzed by flow cytometry . in the absence of auxin, mcm4-aid cells retained a 2c dna content, because fission yeast cells have a long g <dig> phase and cytokinesis occurs in s phase . in contrast, upon addition of auxin, cells with less than a 2c dna content appeared at 2- <dig> h , suggesting that a decrease in mcm4-aid protein retarded dna replication. however, these cells did not exhibit a severe growth defect on the auxin-containing medium . these results show that, although the aid system degrades mcm4-aid protein in fission yeast, more efficient depletion of the target protein is required for physiological analysis.

nls and skp1-fusion to attir <dig> enhances the efficiency of the aid system
we considered two possible reasons for the insufficient depletion of mcm4-aid protein. first, the concentration of attir <dig> imported to the nucleus may not be sufficient to promote efficient degradation, since the mcm complex exists throughout the cell cycle. if this is the case, addition of nuclear localization signals  to attir <dig> should increase the efficiency of degradation. second, the plant attir <dig> may fail to interact strongly with the s. pombe scf components. this problem could be overcome by fusion of attir <dig> with fission yeast skp <dig>  a conserved f-box-interacting protein  <cit>  . the prep <dig> plasmid carrying attir1-nls or skp1-attir <dig> was introduced into the mcm4-aid strain, and the growth of the cells was examined on plates containing auxin. cells expressing attir1-nls grew more slowly than those expressing attir <dig> in the presence of auxin . cells harboring skp1-attir <dig> exhibited severe growth defects on the auxin plate . these results suggest that the inefficient degradation of mcm4-aid protein was mainly due to inefficient formation of the scftir <dig> complex in fission yeast. therefore, we used a strain carrying a single copy of skp1-attir1-nls fusion gene  inserted into the genome in the following experiments.

optimizing the expression of skp1-attir1-nls from the genomic locus
during the course of improving the aid system, we found that the expression level of tir <dig> was crucial for efficient depletion of mcm4-aid protein. the strain carrying pnmt41-skp1-attir1-nls integrated at the ade6+ locus on the chromosome did not show marked growth defects on auxin plates, unlike the results obtained with the strain harboring pnmt41-skp1-attir <dig> on a multicopy plasmid . immunoblotting revealed that the degree of skp1-attir1-nls expression from the pnmt <dig> promoter on the chromosome was about half that of skp1-attir <dig> expressed on the plasmid , suggesting that a certain level of tir <dig> expression is required for efficient degradation. comparison of tir <dig> expression from different promoters showed that the amount of skp1-attir1-nls expressed under control of the adh <dig> promoter , a weak derivative of the adh <dig> promoter  <cit> , was similar to that of skp1-attir <dig> expressed from the pnmt <dig> promoter on the plasmid, while the expression form padh <dig>  a much weaker derivative of padh <dig>  <cit>  was less than that from pnmt <dig> . the padh15-skp1-attir1-nls mcm4-aid strain showed markedly defective growth on auxin-containing plates, whereas the padh <dig> derivative did not . however, a further increase in tir concentration, such as that achieved under control of the nmt <dig> or adh <dig> promoter, led to inhibition of cell growth even in the absence of the aid-tag and auxin . we did not observe inhibition in specific cell-cycle phase. therefore, the cellular concentration of tir <dig> is important for efficient depletion of the target protein as has been observed in plant cells  <cit> .

to examine how efficiently mcm4-aid protein was degraded in the padh15-skp1-attir1-nls mcm4-aid strain, the amount of mcm4-aid in cell extracts prepared from log-phase cells in the presence or absence of auxin was analyzed by immunoblotting. the amount of mcm4-aid protein decreased rapidly within  <dig> h to below  <dig> % of the original amount . the decrease was detected as early as  <dig> min after addition of auxin . under such conditions, a sharp 1c dna peak appeared and was still evident at  <dig> h after addition of auxin . the cell number did not increase after one cell division  and cells were arrested with elongated shape containing a single nucleus . these results show that the improved aid  system depleted mcm4-aid protein to cause tight cell cycle arrest at early s phase.

degradation of mcm4-aid protein in the chromatin-bound mcm complex
next, we investigated whether the i-aid system promotes degradation of mcm4-aid protein in the chromatin-bound mcm complex. cells expressing mcm4-aid and skp1-attir1-nls were synchronized at the g2/m boundary by cdc25- <dig> mutation  <cit>  and released in the presence of hydroxyurea, hu, which allows replication to initiate but retards fork progression due to depletion of deoxynucleotide pools . the cells were then incubated for  <dig> h with auxin, and the amount of mcm4-aid protein was analyzed by immunoblotting. the amount of mcm4-aid was greatly decreased in cells treated with auxin , relative to that in the absence of auxin . these results indicate that most of the mcm4-aid protein was efficiently degraded in the hu-arrested cells. the band showing decreased mobility  at  <dig> h in the presence of hu was probably a form of mcm4-aid protein phosphorylated by ddk, cdk or checkpoint kinases activated in the presence of hu  <cit> . we were concerned whether the i-aid system decreased the amounts of other subunits of the mcm complex in addition to mcm4-aid protein. however, the amounts of these subunits did not change significantly in the presence of auxin . it has been shown that the individual subunits of the mcm complex exists in similar amounts  <cit> , and that the majority form heteromeric hexamers in fission yeast cells  <cit> . taking these observations together with our present results, it is likely that mcm4-aid protein is selectively degraded, leaving the other subunits undegraded.

if mcm4-aid is degraded in the chromatin-associated mcm complex, the other subunits may not remain on the chromatin. to examine whether the other mcm subunits were released upon degradation of mcm4-aid protein, we carried out a chromatin immnoprecipitation  assay using anti-mcm <dig> antibody. two sets of primers amplifying the ars <dig> locus, an efficient replication origin  <cit> , and a non-ars <dig> locus,  <dig> kb distant from the origin, were used for real-time pcr to measure the relative amounts of precipitated dna . in hu-arrested cells without auxin , mcm <dig> was enriched at ars <dig> in comparison with non-ars <dig>  while no significant localization was observed in g2-arrested cells  , as shown in a previous study  <cit> . upon addition of auxin, ip recovery of ars <dig> was decreased markedly to a level similar to that of non-ars <dig> . these results indicate that mcm <dig> is required for maintenance of the other mcm subunits on the chromatin. from these results, we concluded that the i-aid system induced efficient degradation of mcm4-aid in the chromatin-bound mcm complex.

as the mcm complex is essential for progression of the replication fork, dissociation of the mcm complex will arrest dna replication. to confirm this, we used flow cytometry to analyze the recovery of dna replication upon removal of hu . in the absence of auxin, dna replication readily resumed after removal of hu, as dna the content increased from 1c to 2c in 0- <dig> min . in contrast, the dna content of cells treated with auxin remained at 1c even at  <dig> min after removal of hu , indicating that depletion of mcm <dig> prevented progression of the replication fork. this is consistent with the above conclusion that mcm <dig> in the chromatin-bound mcm complex is efficiently depleted by the i-aid system.

application of the i-aid system for depletion of other essential proteins in fission yeast
in order to examine whether the i-aid system is applicable for depletion of other proteins in fission yeast, we constructed strains expressing various essential factors fused with the aid-tag at the c-terminus. the factors examined were orc <dig>  orc <dig> and orc <dig>  components of the origin recognition complex , cdc <dig>  mcm <dig>  psf <dig>  a subunit of gins, cdc <dig> and dpb <dig>  the catalytic and the second largest subunits of dna polε, pol <dig>  pol <dig> and spp <dig>  the catalytic, the second largest and the primase subunits of dna polα, hsk <dig>  the catalytic subunit of ddk, ssl <dig>  a subunit of cohesin loader, and cia1/asf <dig>  a histone chaperone. the effects of the i-aid system were evaluated in terms of growth on auxin-containing plates and dna content analyzed by flow cytometry. growth of the orc2-i-aid strain was severely retarded on the auxin plate and orc6-i-aid and cdc45-i-aid strains showed slow growth. on the other hand, no significant growth retardation was observed for strains cdc20-i-aid, pol1-i-aid and mcm10-i-aid . the results of flow cytometry showed that dna replication was retarded in orc2-i-aid, cdc45-i-aid and cdc20-i-aid, and slightly delayed in orc6-i-aid and pol1-i-aid, whereas no significant defect was observed for mcm10-i-aid . strains orc4-i-aid, psf1-i-aid, pol12-i-aid, spp2-i-aid and dpb2-aid also showed defective growth on auxin plates, whereas hsk1-i-aid, ssl3-i-aid and cia1-i-aid showed no defect . we examined whether the i-aid system affected the amount of mcm10-aid protein, because the above assays had indicated no apparent defect for strain mcm10-i-aid. the results of immunoblotting with anti-mcm <dig> antibody showed that the amount of mcm10-aid protein decreased to less than 25% of the original amount within  <dig> h after addition of auxin , demonstrating that the i-aid system induced degradation of mcm10-aid protein. auxin-induced decrease in the tagged protein was also observed in ssl3-i-aid and cia1-i-aid strains . although the i-aid system can induce degradation of various proteins in fission yeast, further efficient depletion, which results in tight arrest of the cell cycle, will be required to analyze the functions of proteins at the molecular level.

efficient depletion of replication proteins by the off-aid system causes tight cell-cycle arrest
although the i-aid system promoted rapid degradation of various target proteins, significant amounts of protein remained after depletion , probably due to de novo protein synthesis. in order to decrease the target protein further, we combined the i-aid system with transcriptional repression . to achieve this, the pol1-aid and cdc45-aid genes were placed under the control of the thiamine-repressible pnmt <dig> promoter. in addition, both attir <dig> and oryza sativa tir <dig> , which induces more efficient degradation than attir <dig> in budding yeast  <cit> , were expressed from constitutive padh <dig> promoters . thiamine was added to shut off the transcription of the pol1-aid or cdc45-aid gene, and then auxin was added during cell cycle arrest at the g2/m boundary using cdc25- <dig> mutation . upon release from g2/m at  <dig> h after addition of auxin, the amounts of pol1-aid and cdc45-aid proteins were greatly decreased to nearly undetectable levels . the results of flow cytometry showed that pol1-off-aid and cdc45-off-aid cells were arrested with a 1c dna content, indicating severe defects in the early stage of dna replication . the off-aid system promoted strong growth defect on auxin plates for almost all the strains tested including mcm10-off-aid, hsk1-off-aid, ssl3-off-aid, and cia1-off-aid, which did not show significant defect with the i-aid system . these results suggest that the off-aid system consisting of the i-aid combined with promoter shut-off of the target gene is widely applicable for efficient depletion of proteins in fission yeast cells.

discussion
we have developed a powerful protein depletion system, "off-aid", in fission yeast by combining transcription repression with auxin-dependent protein degradation. an initial attempt that involved expression of tir <dig> in strain mcm4-aid showed only a marginal defect on cell growth in the presence of auxin. however, the i-aid system consisting of tir <dig> fused with fission yeast skp <dig> markedly increased the efficiency of mcm4-aid protein degradation, causing severe replication defect and cell cycle arrest. this suggested that the interaction between plant tir <dig> and fission yeast skp <dig> might be rate-limiting for scftir <dig> assembly. we also showed that the level of tir <dig> expression is crucial for efficient depletion of mcm4-aid protein as observed in plant cells  <cit> . expression of skp1-tir1-nls from the adh <dig> promoter resulted in severely defective growth on an auxin plate, whereas a reduced cellular concentration of skp1-tir1-nls expressed from the nmt <dig> promoter did not result in the same phenotype . we noticed that the naa concentration is also important for the aid system in fission yeast. the mcm4-i-aid strain did not show growth defect at  <dig>  mm naa, whereas naa concentration higher than  <dig> mm affected the growth of untagged strain . since auxin may act as a signaling molecule to promote morphogenesis in budding yeast  <cit> , a similar pathway may present in fission yeast. the i-aid system decreased the level of mcm4-aid protein to about 10% of the original amount at  <dig> h after auxin addition , suggesting the utility of this system for depletion of the protein within a short period during the cell cycle. although the i-aid system resulted in retardation of dna replication and cell growth for more than half  of essential factors tested, significant defect was not observed for the mcm10-i-aid, hsk1-i-aid, ssl3-i-aid and cia1-i-aid . for the latter cases, the amount of remaining tagged protein seems to be higher  than those showing the defect . difference in degradation efficiency might be caused by the affinity of tir <dig> with the target proteins or the efficiency of ubiquitination in different targets. in addition, whether or not depletion of a protein causes severe phenotype may depend on the amount of protein required for its function. however, for the proteins that were not efficiently depleted by the i-aid system, the off-aid system that combines transcription repression with the i-aid system would be advantageous. the off-aid system promoted a reduction of the cdc45-aid and pol1-aid proteins to almost undetectable levels, causing severe defects in dna replication. in addition, essential proteins unrelated to replication such as ssl <dig> that is involved in sister chromatid cohesion and cia1/asf <dig> required for histone deposition can be depleted by the off-aid system to cause severe growth defects . therefore, this approach appears to be widely applicable for in vivo protein depletion in fission yeast.

in comparison of the aid system with previously published strategies, the aid system has several advantages. comparing the flow cytometry results by depletion of the same target protein mcm <dig>  mcm4-i-aid cells remained with a sharp 1c dna peak as long as  <dig> hr, whereas dna content significantly increased after  <dig> hr incubation in mcm4ts-td cells , suggesting that the i-aid system achieved tight cell cycle arrest in early s phase. in contrast to ts-degron, which requires high-temperature shift or sometimes temperature-sensitive allele of the target gene, the aid system promotes the degradation by addition of a synthetic auxin to the culture. this allows use of the cdc25- <dig> temperature-sensitive mutation for cell cycle synchronization. furthermore, the off-aid system causes more extensive depletion than the i-aid system alone . on the other hand, there are some disadvantages of the off-aid system. it requires two-step modifications of target genes; fusion of the aid-tag sequence at the c-terminus and replacement of the promoter with the nmt <dig> promoter. the n-terminally aid-tagged pol1-noff-aid, cdc20-noff-aid and mcm10-noff-aid strains, which were constructed by one-step replacement of the n-terminus of the gene, did not exhibit significant defect in cell growth or dna replication . a limitation of the aid system we noticed is that the degradation efficiency decreases at high temperature . although use of ostir <dig> instead of attir <dig> have overcome this problem in budding yeast and dt <dig> aid systems  <cit> , mcm4-i-aid strain expressing padh15-skp1-ostir <dig> in fission yeast did not improve degradation efficiency at 36°c .

a remarkable feature of the i-aid system was that it selectively degraded mcm4-aid protein from the mcm complex without depleting the other subunits . this feature would make the system suitable for functional analysis of single components of a large complex. this property is attributable to the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation system, as reported for the ts-degron system in budding yeast  <cit> . it was also notable that the i-aid system degraded mcm4-aid protein not only in the soluble fraction but also in the chromatin-bound mcm complex . in hu-arrested cells, where the replication machinery stalls near the replication origin, depletion of mcm4-aid protein caused dissociation of mcm <dig> from chromatin, probably along with the other subunits. consistently, replication did not resume after removal of hu, because the mcm complex is required as a replicative helicase for fork progression . therefore, depletion of a component of the chromatin-bound complex, such as the replication fork, would be a powerful tool for analyzing the functions of chromatin proteins at specific stages of the reaction. it is likely that cytosolic proteins in fission yeast are also susceptible to auxin-dependent degradation, as has been described  <cit> , although we did not test them in the present study.

the mcm4-i-aid strain exhibited the most marked defects in growth and replication upon addition of auxin among the aid-tagged strains tested . this is probably because a significantly large number of mcm complexes need to be loaded onto several hundred replication origins on the chromosomes  <cit>  within the short g <dig> phase in the fission yeast cell cycle. once the mcm complexes on chromatin have dissociated through degradation of mcm4-aid protein in s phase, cells are unable to resume dna replication because loading of the mcm complex onto chromatin is strongly inhibited after onset of s phase in order to avoid re-replication  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we provided an improved auxin-indusible degron system for fission yeast. the i-aid system, where tir <dig> is fused with fission yeast skp <dig>  greatly enhanced degradation efficiency of mcm4-aid protein, and the off-aid system, which combines the i-aid system with transcription repression, successfully depleted cdc45-aid and pol1-aid proteins causing arrest at early s phase. the off-aid system is a powerful method for depletion of specific proteins within fission yeast cells.
