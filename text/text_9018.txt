BACKGROUND
voltage-gated potassium  channels play various essential physiological roles in neurons, including controlling neuronal excitability, setting neuronal firing frequencies, shaping action potential waveforms, and modulating neurotransmitter release  <cit> . the ether-à-go-go  k+ channel belongs to the eag family of voltage-gated k+ channels that comprises three gene subfamilies; these are eag , erg , and elk   <cit> . results from in situ hybridization studies have indicated that eag is neuron-specific k+ channel that is widely expressed in various regions of the brain  <cit> . in mammals, two eag isoforms have been identified: eag <dig>  and eag <dig>   <cit> .

despite their abundant expression in the brain, the functional significance of eag <dig> and eag <dig> k+ channels remains obscure. one strategy to ascertain the neurophysiological role of voltage-gated ion channels is to identify their subcellular localization in neurons  <cit> . previous immunofluorescence characterization carried out in our laboratory has demonstrated that rat eag <dig>  and rat eag <dig>  k+ channels have different subcellular localizations over the dendrosomatic compartment in both hippocampal neurons and the retina  <cit> ; specifically, reag <dig> channels exhibit a much broader range of expression, extending from somas to distal dendrites, and show a distinct punctate localization pattern. since this punctate staining is co-localized with the presynaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin and the postsynaptic density protein densin- <dig>  <cit> , it is likely that reag <dig> is present within the synaptic region. given that our previous immunofluorescence study was conducted with 14 days in vitro  hippocampal cultures, wherein extensive neuronal connections are already formed, it was not possible to determine precisely whether reag <dig> and/or reag <dig> show axonal localization. a recent report applying immunofluorescence and quantum dot technology to div <dig> hippocampal neurons confirmed the punctate expression and synaptic localization of reag <dig> channels  <cit> ; moreover, this study also found that the immunofluorescence staining of reag <dig> is co-localized with that of the axon marker tau, raising the possibility that reag <dig> channels may be present in axons.

emerging evidence suggests that specific sequence motifs within channel proteins may govern the subcellular distribution of ion channels in neurons  <cit> . the proteins reag <dig> and reag <dig> share about 70% identity in amino acid sequence and thus belong to the same eag k+ channel subfamily  <cit> . nevertheless, it remains unclear what constitutes the structural basis that dictates the differential subcellular localization of these two closely related voltage-gated k+ channels. in this study, we addressed this question by generating chimeras between reag <dig> and reag <dig> k+ channels. quantitative analysis of these chimeras indicates that the proximal post-cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain  region in the carboxyl  terminus confers the punctate localization of reag <dig> k+ channels in hippocampal neurons.

animals and hippocampal cultures
all procedures were in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of mammals in neuroscience and behavioral research  and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee  of national yang-ming university.

15-day pregnant sprague–dawley rats were purchased from the facility for animal research of the national yang-ming university. dissociated hippocampal cultures were prepared using a previously described protocol  <cit>  with a minor modification  <cit> . in brief, hippocampi were dissected from the brains of embryonic day  <dig>  embryos, the brains of which were removed and placed in the hank’s balanced salt solution that contains 10 mm hepes  and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. the hippocampus was dissected out and dissociated by incubation with  <dig> % trypsin solution. the dissociated cells were plated on coverslips at a density of  <dig> and  <dig> cells/mm <dig> for immunofluorescence and dna transfection, respectively. coverslips were coated with poly-d-lysine   and laminin  . cultures were maintained in the neurobasal media supplemented with b <dig>  and glutamax i   in a humidified 5% co <dig> incubator at 37°c.

adult female xenopus laevis  were anesthetized by immersion in ice water containing tricaine . ovarian follicles were removed from xenopus frogs, cut into small pieces, and incubated in the nd <dig> solution . to remove the follicular membrane, xenopus oocytes were incubated in the ca2+-free nd <dig> solution containing collagenase  on an orbital shaker  for about 60-90 min at room temperature. after several washes with collagenase-free, ca2+-free nd <dig>  oocytes were transferred to nd <dig>  stage v-vi xenopus oocytes were then selected for crna injection.

molecular biology
the cdnas for reag <dig> and reag <dig> k+ channel subunits were kindly provided by dr. olaf pongs . green fluorescent protein -tagged reag <dig> and reag <dig> constructs were made by subcloning the full length reag <dig> and reag <dig> cdnas into the pegfp mammalian expression vector .

the design of the chimeras between reag <dig> and reag <dig> were based on sequence alignment. chimeric channels were constructed by using the overlap pcr mutagenesis method. all constructs were verified by dna sequencing .

for dna transfection, human embryonic kidney  293 t cells were maintained in dmem  supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine,  <dig> units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10%  fetal bovine serum . for immunofluorescence and electrophysiology, cells were grown on poly-lysine-coated coverslips. after 24 hrs, hek293t cells were transiently transfected with cdnas by using the lipofectamine  <dig>  reagent .

cultured hippocampal neurons at 7 days in vitro  were also transfected by using lf <dig>  briefly, various expression constructs were incubated with the lf <dig> reagent for 20 min at room temperature. dna-lipofectamine diluted in the complete medium was added to neuron culture wells. after 4-hr incubation at 37°c under 5% co <dig>  cells were washed gently three times with the culture media and maintained in the incubator before being examined under a fluorescence microscope.

for in vitro transcription, cdnas were linearized with noti. capped crnas were transcribed in vitro from the linearized cdna template with the mmessage mmachine t <dig> kit . the apparent molecular weight and concentration of crnas were verified with gel electrophoresis and determined by spectrophotometry, respectively. for crna injection, the total volume of injection was always  <dig>  nl per xenopus oocyte. injected oocytes were stored at 16°c in nd <dig> 

immunofluorescence
coverslips containing hek293t cells or hippocampal neurons were rinsed in pbs  and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs at 4°c for 20 min. cells were then permeabilized and blocked with a blocking buffer  triton x- <dig>  and  <dig>  m nacl) for 60 min at 4°c. appropriate dilutions of primary antibodies were applied in the blocking buffer overnight at 4°c. immunoreactivities were visualized with goat-anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to alexa <dig> or with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to alexa <dig> . the fluorescence images were viewed and acquired with a leica tcs sp <dig> laser-scanning confocal microscope.

image analyses were performed with the imagej software . to determine the number of immunofluorescence clusters per fixed length of neurite, built-in “set scale” and “freehand tool” functions of the software were applied to trace multiple 100-μm neurite segments, followed by counting the number of psd-95/reag1/reag <dig> puncta within each 100-μm neurite segment. co-localization of psd- <dig>  and reag1/reag <dig>  puncta within each 100-μm neurite segment was recognized by identifying the presence of overlapping punctate pixels. for neurons transfected with various gfp-tagged constructs, the number of gfp puncta per neuron was also estimated using imagej. statistical analyses were executed with the origin  <dig>  software . all numerical data are shown as mean ± standard error .

subcellular fractionation of rat brain and preparation of psds
subcellular and psd fractions of adult rat brains were prepared as described previously  <cit> . in brief, adult rat forebrains were homogenized in the buffer h <dig>  containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors  and centrifuged at  <dig> ×g to remove nuclei and other large debris . the s <dig> fraction was subject to centrifugation at  <dig> xg to obtain the crude synaptosome fraction . the pellet was resuspended in the buffer h <dig>  and layered onto the top of the discontinuous sucrose density gradient by using  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  m sucrose layers. the gradient was centrifuged at  <dig> xg for 2 hrs in a beckman instruments sw- <dig> rotor and the synaptosomal fraction  was recovered from the  <dig> - <dig>  m sucrose interface. the synaptosomal fraction was extracted in ice-cold  <dig> % triton x-100/50 mm tris–hcl  for 15 min and centrifuged at  <dig> xg for 45 min to obtain the psd i pellet. the pellet was resuspended and further extracted a second time with  <dig> % triton x-100/50 mm tris–hcl , followed by centrifugation at  <dig> ×g for 45 min to obtain the psd ii pellet. protein concentration was determined by the bca protein assay kit . for immunoblotting, 25 μg  or 5 μg  of proteins were separated by sds-page, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with the primary antibodies, and imaged with the enhanced chemiluminescence method .

electrophysiology
for hek293t cells, conventional whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to record eag k+ currents as described previously  <cit> . in brief, recordings were performed at 24-48 hrs post-transfection. patch electrodes with a resistance of ~4 mΩ were pulled on a narishige pp- <dig> electrode puller and were filled with a solution containing   <dig> kcl,  <dig> mgcl <dig>   <dig> egta,  <dig> hepes, ph  <dig> . external bath solution comprised   <dig> nacl,  <dig> kcl,  <dig> cacl <dig>  and  <dig> hepes, ph  <dig> .

conventional two-electrode voltage clamp recording in xenopus oocytes were performed as described previously  <cit> . in brief, 2-3 days after crna injection, oocytes were functionally assayed in a recording bath containing about ~200 μl of the ringer solution . an agarose bridge was used to connect the bath solution with a ground chamber  into which two ground electrodes were inserted. borosilicate electrodes  used in voltage recording and current injection were filled with 3 m kcl.

voltage-clamp protocols were applied with the pclamp  <dig> / <dig>  software . data were acquired with an axopatch 200a amplifier   or oc-725c oocyte clamp  , followed by digitization at 10 khz with the digidata 1320a/1322a system . also by using the pclamp  <dig> / <dig>  software, data were filtered at 1 khz and passive membrane properties were compensated with the -p/ <dig> leak subtraction method. all recordings were performed at room temperature .

cells with large currents in which voltage clamp errors might appear were excluded from data analyses. kinetic fitting of eag k+ current traces were implemented with the pclamp  <dig> / <dig>  software. subsequent numerical analyses and data plotting were performed with the origin  <dig>  software. all numerical data are shown as mean ± sem.

RESULTS
different localizations of reag <dig> and reag <dig> channels in axons and synapses
we began by asking whether reag <dig> and reag <dig> k+ channels are present in axons. for isolated hippocampal neurons, the process of axon-dendrite polarization initiates within the first 36 hours in culture and by 72 hours in culture, a single neurite undergoing fast elongation has become an axon  <cit> . we therefore decided to perform immunofluorescence characterization in div <dig>  div <dig>  and div <dig> neurons. as illustrated in figure 1a, reag <dig> staining was found to co-localize with the dendrite marker microtubule-associated protein  <dig>  in all three populations of cultured hippocampal neurons, which is consistent with our previous observation that reag <dig> k+ channels are present in the dendrosomatic compartment. furthermore, the characteristic punctate localization of reag <dig> channels was visible in div <dig> neurons and was profusely present in div <dig> neurons. interestingly, by closely inspecting the div <dig> and div <dig> neurons, whose neurite networks were less sophisticated, we also observed significant reag <dig> immunofluorescence signal in map2-negative neurites, which implies that reag <dig> channels may be present in axons as well. we then compared the immunofluorescence signals of reag <dig> with those of the axon marker tau. figure 1b shows that in div <dig> neurons, where the location of the axon is clearly defined by the tau immunofluorescence signal, reag <dig> channels are present within the soma and also in the complete axonal compartment. a similar tau-positive reag <dig> immunostaining pattern can be observed in div <dig> and div <dig> neurons as well, although a significant fraction of the immunofluorescence signal may represent the presence of the channel protein in axons stemming from neighboring neurons. these findings thus demonstrate that reag <dig> channels are universally distributed in both the dendrosomatic and the axonal compartments of hippocampal neurons.

we also found that reag <dig> was co-localized with map <dig> in all three populations of cultured hippocampal neurons . in addition, we found that a fraction of the immunofluorescence signal of reag <dig> was co-localized with that of the tau immunofluorescence signal, especially in immature div <dig> neurons . in contrast to reag <dig>  which was found to be universally present throughout the axonal compartment, in div <dig> and div <dig> neurons, reag <dig> seemed to display a pattern in axons that was relatively restricted and showed a low overall level of expression . most importantly, in virtually all the neuron samples we analyzed, reag <dig> did not show a significant punctate distribution within either the dendrosomatic or the axonal compartments.

as mentioned above, the punctate localization of reag <dig> channels was copious in div <dig> neurons, which are known to form numerous and widespread synaptic connections. we quantified the reag <dig> puncta within the neurons by calculating the puncta density, which was defined as the number of immunofluorescence puncta per 100-μm neurite . the puncta density of reag <dig> was about 39 ±  <dig> , which is quite similar to that of the postsynaptic density  marker psd- <dig>  . in contrast, the puncta density of reag <dig> was only about 5 ±  <dig> . this lack of punctate staining pattern seems to imply that reag <dig> is not significantly present at synapses. consistent with this notion, only about 1 ± 1% of psd- <dig> puncta were found to be co-localized with reag <dig> puncta, and conversely the psd- <dig> co-localization ratio of reag <dig> puncta was only about 6 ± 3% . this contrasts with about 68 ± 2% of psd- <dig> puncta being co-localized with reag <dig> puncta, and with about 74 ± 2% of reag <dig> puncta being co-localized with psd- <dig> puncta .

an alternative approach to addressing the synaptic localization of proteins is to examine their subcellular fractionation. by this approach, the differential localization of synapse-related proteins can be demonstrated via their distinct enrichment patterns in the synaptosomal  and the two psd  fractions. as depicted in figure 2d, the presynaptic marker synaptophysin was highly enriched in the spm fraction and was virtually absent in the psd ii fraction. in contrast, psd- <dig>  as well as β-actin, was found to be highly enriched in both the psd i and the psd ii fractions. moreover, figure 2d clearly demonstrates that reag <dig> protein was significantly enriched in all three of the synaptosomal sub-fractions. taken together, these findings imply that a significant number of reag <dig> k+ channels may be present at presynaptic axonal terminals and/or on the postsynaptic dendritic spines.

differential subcellular localization of gfp-tagged reag <dig> and reag <dig> channels in hippocampal neurons
to further demonstrate that the punctate localization pattern was indeed an innate distinction between the two channel isoforms, we studied next the exogenous over-expression of reag <dig> and reag <dig> proteins in hippocampal neurons. a gfp-tag was engineered to be attached to the amino  terminus of both reag <dig> and reag <dig>  upon over-expression in hek293t cells, the gfp-tagged constructs displayed a clear membrane localization pattern and produced functional k+ currents ; these findings indicate that the membrane trafficking and biophysical properties of the gfp-tagged channels are similar to those of their wild-type counterparts. the cdnas encoding the gfp-tagged proteins were then transfected into div <dig> neurons and this was followed by confocal microscopic analyses at 5 days post-transfection. as shown in figure 3b , over-expressed gfp-reag <dig> channels, but not over-expressed gfp-reag <dig> channels, displayed significant punctate localization in div <dig> neurons. these findings are reminiscent of the differential subcellular localization of endogenous reag <dig> and reag <dig> channels.

characterization of the subcellular localization of chimeric channels in hippocampal neurons
both endogenous and over-expressed reag <dig> channels displayed a punctate localization, which strongly suggests that one or more specific sequence motifs within its amino acid sequence may govern the subcellular distribution of the k+ channel in neurons. although reag <dig> and reag <dig> share about 70% identity in amino acid sequence  <cit> , a significant sequence divergence is present within the c-terminal post-cnbhd region, especially from residues a <dig> through s <dig> in reag <dig> vs. l <dig> through f <dig> in reag <dig> . to test the hypothesis that a key structural domain within the post-cnbhd region may contribute to the punctate localization of reag <dig> k+ channels, we generated two chimeric constructs  by exchanging the majority of the divergent post-cnbhd sequences between the two channel isoforms . upon over-expression in hek293t cells or xenopus oocytes, both of the chimeric channels yielded significant k+ currents and effective membrane surface expression . we then over-expressed these gfp-tagged chimeras in hippocampal neurons in order to study their subcellular localization patterns. confocal microscopic analysis revealed that the gfp-reag1-i chimera displayed a reag2-like pattern with only a few gfp puncta  . by way of contrast, the gfp fluorescence of the reverse chimera gfp-reag2-i exhibited reag1-like punctate localization  . we also quantified the puncta density of the gfp signal by calculating the number of gfp puncta per neuron. the gfp puncta densities of gfp-reag <dig> and gfp-reag <dig> were about 153 ±  <dig> and 17 ±  <dig>  respectively . this 9-fold difference in gfp puncta density between over-expressed gfp-reag <dig> and gfp-reag <dig> channels is almost equivalent to the previously measured 8-fold difference in puncta density between endogenous reag <dig> and reag <dig> proteins . the gfp puncta density of the gfp-reag1-i chimera was dramatically reduced to about 31 ±  <dig>  which is statistically similar to that of gfp-reag <dig> . in contrast, the gfp puncta density of the gfp-reag2-i chimera was remarkably increased to about 109 ±  <dig> ; this value, although falling short of that of the gfp-reag <dig> density, is more than 6-fold higher than that of the gfp-reag <dig> density. when taken together, these findings suggest a potential correlation between the presence of the reag <dig> post-cnbhd sequence and the punctate localization of the protein in question in hippocampal neurons.

to further examine whether the post-cnbhd region may contribute to the differential subcellular localization of the two eag isoforms, we generated three additional reag <dig> chimeras, namely reag1-ii, reag1-iii, and reag1-iv, each of which contains a separate reag <dig> post-cnbhd segment with a distinct sequence divergence from that of reag <dig> . in the heterologous expression system, the functional and membrane trafficking properties of all three reag <dig> chimeras were similar to those of wild-type reag <dig> . we then inspected the subcellular localization of these gfp-tagged chimeras in div <dig> hippocampal neurons  . a quantitative analysis of the gfp fluorescence results indicated that the gfp puncta densities of gfp-reag1-ii, gfp-reag1-iii, and gfp-reag1-iv chimeras were about 22 ±  <dig>  124 ±  <dig>  and 108 ±  <dig>  respectively . in other words, a reag2-like pattern with very few gfp puncta was only observed in the gfp-reag1-ii chimera, which is the protein where the proximal post-cnbhd region  has been substituted with its reag <dig> counterpart .

the above findings imply that the proximal post-cnbhd region of reag <dig> is likely to play an essential role in the expression of a punctate localization pattern. to further test this hypothesis, we then constructed three reverse reag <dig> chimeras, namely reag2-ii, reag2-iii, and reag2-iv, each of which harbored a segment of the reag <dig> post-cnbhd sequences . in the heterologous expression system, the three reag <dig> chimeras were similar to each other in terms of their functional and membrane trafficking properties . figure 6d  illustrates representative localization patterns of the gfp-tagged chimeras in hippocampal neurons. the calculated values of gfp puncta densities were about 86 ±  <dig> , 13 ±  <dig> , and 13 ±  <dig>  . therefore, prominent punctate localization was only found when gfp-reag2-ii, the chimera containing the reag <dig> segment a723-r <dig>  was present.

the foregoing observations directly imply that the distal post-cnbhd region, including the carboxyl assembly domain  , is not involved in determining the subcellular localization of reag <dig>  to address this issue, we focused on a previously identified truncation mutant that lacks cad, k848x, the membrane trafficking and biophysical properties of which are similar to those of wild-type reag <dig>  <cit> . figure  <dig>  shows that gfp-reag1-k848x does indeed display considerable punctate localization in div <dig> hippocampal neurons. the gfp puncta density of gfp-reag1-k848x , while less than that of gfp-reag <dig>  is about 6-fold higher than that of gfp-reag <dig>  which is consistent with the idea that the distal post-cnbhd region is not required for conferring the punctate localization on reag <dig> channels.

the voltage-dependent gating properties of the chimeric channels
in addition to divergent subcellular localization patterns, reag <dig> and reag <dig> channels also have different gating properties including steady-state voltage dependence and activation/deactivation kinetics  <cit> . a similar disparity has also been observed in human eag <dig> and eag <dig> channels  <cit> . to understand whether sequence divergence in the post-cnbhd region may also contribute to the distinct biophysical properties of the two eag k+ channel isoforms, we went on to analyze the gating property of the chimeras. the left panels in figure  <dig>  as well as table  <dig>  demonstrate that the steady-state voltage dependence  properties of the chimeras are similar to those of their wild-type counterparts, indicating that sequence divergence in the post-cnbhd region is not able to account for the ~40-mv discrepancy in voltage activation between reag <dig> and reag <dig>  furthermore, despite about two-fold difference in the activation kinetics between the two eag isoforms, exchanging post-cnbhd sequences led to only a small acceleration in the activation kinetics of all chimeras . moreover, the introduction of chimeric post-cnbhd sequences did not have any significant effect on the deactivation kinetics of the two eag isoforms . taken together, our biophysical findings demonstrate that the sequence differences in the post-cnbhd region are unable to explain the divergence in the voltage-dependent gating properties of reag <dig> and reag <dig> k+ channels.

discussion
in this report, we began by inspecting the subcellular localization of reag <dig> and reag <dig> k+ channels in young and mature neurons in culture. our immunofluorescence analysis indicated that, in addition to the dendrosomatic domain, both two eag isoforms were present in axons of hippocampal neurons. most importantly, significant punctate distribution was observed in both the dendrosomatic and the axonal compartments for reag <dig> channels only. in addition, by over-expressing gfp-tagged constructs, we found that gfp-reag <dig>  but not gfp-reag <dig>  displayed significant punctate localization in hippocampal neurons, which is reminiscent of the differential subcellular localization of endogenous reag <dig> and reag <dig> channels. we further addressed the structural basis underlying the differences in localization patterns and demonstrated that the proximal post-cnbhd region  in the c-terminus confers the punctate localization of reag <dig> k+ channels in hippocampal neurons. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence showing that the post-cnbhd region seems to contribute to the subcellular localization of eag k+ channels.

the assessment of protein expression in axons may be hindered by the presence of extensive neurite connections within cultured neurons, as was seen in our previous study of div <dig> hippocampal cultures  <cit> . in this study we focused on the immunofluorescence characterization of younger neurons where the neurite network is less sophisticated. by closely inspecting div <dig> neurons, wherein one fast-growing neurite becomes the axon and the other slow-growing neurites become the dendrites  <cit> , we observed significant immunofluorescence signal in map2-negative, tau-positive neurites for both reag <dig> and reag <dig> k+ channels. similar results were also found in div <dig> neurons, wherein dendritic spine formation and synaptic connections can be clearly identified  <cit> . together with our previous demonstration of their dendrosomatic localization  <cit> , we propose that in hippocampal neurons the two rat eag isoforms seem to play distinct but essential physiological roles in modulating dendrosomatic excitability, as well as in the propagation of action potential in axons. the foregoing inference is reminiscent of the physiological significance of the prototypic eag channel that was cloned from drosophila <cit> . electrophysiological recordings from motor neurons in drosophila with mutations in the eag gene revealed an increase in spontaneous neuronal firing and presynaptic transmitter release  <cit> , which is consistent with the somatic and axonal localization of drosophila eag k+ channels. moreover, drosophila with mutations in the eag gene were found to be deficient in antennal sensitivity to a subset of odorants  <cit> , which suggests that eag k+ channels may also display dendritic localization in the olfactory receptor neurons of drosophila antennae.

in clear agreement with the conclusion drawn from our previous immunofluorescence studies  <cit> , the current study demonstrates that reag <dig>  but not reag <dig>  displays significant punctate localization in both the dendrosomatic and the axonal compartments of mature hippocampal neurons. a significant fraction of reag <dig> puncta was found to be co-localized with synaptic markers such as synaptophysin  <cit> , densin- <dig>  <cit> , and psd- <dig> . furthermore, fractionation analysis revealed that reag <dig> was highly enriched in the synaptosomal fraction . we therefore propose that reag <dig> channels are significantly expressed at presynaptic axonal terminals and on postsynaptic dendritic spines, and may play a critical role in controlling neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic signaling.

specific structural domains have been identified to explain the structure-function mechanisms underlying the divergent voltage-gating processes of different k+ channels  <cit> . similarly, various sequence motifs within different voltage-gated k+ channels have been shown to govern their subcellular localization and the targeting of channel proteins to different neuronal compartments  <cit> . despite the presence of about 70% identity in amino acid sequence between the eag <dig> and eag <dig> k+ channel proteins  <cit> , the structural bases of their different voltage-gating properties and subcellular localizations have remained largely elusive. previous biophysical analysis of a series of different chimeras between human eag <dig> and eag <dig>  for example, revealed that the transmembrane regions alone were not sufficient to explain the differences in their gating kinetics and steady-state voltage-dependence  <cit> . in addition, similar to our results here , non-membrane regions per se were found not to determine their gating behaviors  <cit> . together these results suggest that the divergent voltage-gating property between the two eag isoforms may rather arise from interactions among multiple structural domains within the channel protein.

in this study we found that the gfp-tagged reag <dig> chimeras  that harbor the proximal post-cnbhd region of reag <dig> displayed a dramatic reduction in hippocampal neuron fluorescence puncta . conversely, notable punctate patterns were observed with the gfp-tagged reag <dig> chimeras  which contain the proximal post-cnbhd region of reag <dig> . finally, the reag <dig> truncation mutant k848x that lacks the distal post-cnbhd region still displayed significant punctate localization in hippocampal neurons . taken these findings as a whole, they strongly support the hypothesis that the punctate localization of reag <dig> k+ channels is conferred by the proximal post-cnbhd region. however, it remains to be determined whether this region alone is sufficient to determine the pre/post-synaptic localization of reag <dig>  one alternative is that the synaptic targeting of reag <dig> channels may involve interactions between a subset of the proximal post-cnbhd sequences and other protein domains. furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that certain proximal-post-cnbhd-interacting protein may be required for the punctate/synaptic localization of reag <dig> protein.

as mentioned in the results section, for the k848x truncation mutant and the chimeras that do display prominent punctate localization, their gfp puncta densities are about 5-fold to 7-fold higher than that of wild-type reag <dig>  nevertheless, the gfp puncta densities of these constructs are still actually lower than that of wild-type reag <dig>  the reason for this discrepancy is unknown. one possible explanation is that in neurons, the chimeric and mutant constructs are less effective in terms of protein expression, membrane trafficking, and/or puncta formation.

CONCLUSIONS
immunofluorescence studies reveal that in hippocampal neurons, reag <dig> and reag <dig> k+ channels are present in both the dendrosomatic and the axonal compartments. in addition, reag <dig> protein is significantly expressed within synaptic regions and displays a distinct punctate localization pattern. by studying a series of different chimeric constructs between reag <dig> and reag <dig>  we have determined that the proximal post-cnbhd region of the reag <dig> protein confers punctate localization of reag <dig> k+ channels. these findings highlight a new direction for studies in this area and provide important insights that should help the elucidation of the physiological significance of eag k+ channels in the brain.
