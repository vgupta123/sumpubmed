BACKGROUND
in males aged  <dig> –  <dig> years, type ii testicular germ cell tumors , i.e. seminomas and nonseminomas, are the most common malignancies with fatal outcome  <cit>  accounting for up to 60% of all malignancies in young man. the incidence of this type of cancer has been steadily increasing throughout the last decades  <cit> . the tumors arise from a neoplastic precursor, the carcinoma in situ /intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified  and develop into seminoma and/or nonseminoma   <cit> . the igcnu lesions are believed to arise by delayed or blocked maturation of primordial germ cells /gonocytes during early fetal development  <cit> . the recently identified markers for igcnu and seminoma, namely the markers of pluripotency oct3/ <dig> and nanog further support this model  <cit> .

expression of pluripotency genes is detected in embryonic stem cells  and the inner cell mass of the early embryo. additionally murine and human es cells need to be cultured in the presence of factors inhibiting differentiation, although there are species specific differences  <cit> . in pgcs, early gonocytes and igcnu as well as seminoma lesions some of these markers of pluripotency are expressed, although differences have been reported  <cit> . according to the current model, pgcs actively suppress somatic differentiation programs by epigenetic modifications, a mechanism which might also account for igcnu and seminoma  <cit> . recent data in mice demonstrate that suppression of somatic differentiation programs in pgcs is mediated by a complex of two proteins, blimp <dig>  and prmt <dig> . upon arrival in the genital ridge the pgcs differentiate to become gonocytes and the blimp1/prmt <dig> complex is translocated in the cytoplasm and subsequently, blimp <dig> is downregulated. targeted deletion of blimp <dig> leads to loss of pgcs short after specification due to differentiation. the blimp1-deficient pgcs display an insufficient repression of markers indicative for somatic differentiation such as hoxb <dig>  <cit> . blimp <dig> is a transcriptional repressor harboring an n-terminal pr-set domain,  <dig> zinc-finger domains and an acidic domain at the c-terminus. in murine pgcs the blimp1/prmt <dig> complex mediates symmetrical methylation of histones h2a and h <dig> at arginine  <dig> , resulting in widespread epigenetic modification leading to transcriptional repression  <cit> .

in the present study, we investigated the expression of blimp1/prmt <dig> during human fetal germ cell development and in testicular germ cell tumors. analyzing human fetal tissues, we found blimp1/prmt <dig> colocalized in gonocytes at weeks  <dig> –  <dig> of pregnancy, supporting a role in human germ cell development. furthermore blimp1/prmt <dig> is expressed in igcnu and seminoma, but downregulated in nonseminomatous gcts. since the nuclear localization of blimp <dig> correlated with the presence of the histone modifications h2ar3me2s and h4r3me <dig>  our data help in explaining the undifferentiated/fetal state of igcnu and seminoma.

RESULTS
normal germ cell development
data from murine embryos indicate, that the murine homologs of blimp <dig> and prmt <dig>  are expressed in pgcs from specification on up to their arrival in the genital ridge  <cit> . short thereafter, these cells differentiate to become gonocytes and the blimp1/prmt <dig> complex is translocated in the cytoplasm and subsequently, blimp <dig> is downregulated. in order to test whether human blimp <dig> and prmt <dig> are detected in human fetal pgcs/gonocytes, immunohistochemical analyses were performed on human fetal material. on the 12th week of pregnancy migrating gonocytes coexpressing prmt <dig> and blimp <dig> were detected, . next, testes from the 19th week of pregnancy were analyzed. by this time gonocytes gradually differentiate into prespermatogonia and migrate towards the periphery of the emerging seminiferous tubules to settle down in their niche  <cit> . both blimp <dig>  and prmt <dig>  were detected at this stage in gonocytes. prmt <dig>  in contrast to blimp <dig>  was detected both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. since the murine blimp1/prmt <dig> complex has been described to mediate symmetrical dimethylation of arginine  <dig> on histone h2a and/or h <dig> tails   <cit>  immunohistochemical analysis to detect this modification was performed . co-staining of prmt <dig> revealed that the cells displaying high nuclear levels of prmt <dig> are in fact positive for the h2ar3me2s/h4r3me2s histone mark . to further analyze the population of cells expressing blimp <dig> we performed double labeling experiments using blimp <dig>  and the gonocytal markers m2a <cit>  . blimp1/m2a double positive signals were detected in most gonocytes . double labeling for h2ar3me2s/h4r3me2s  combined with m2a  showed, that the m2a positive gonocytes displayed h2ar3me2s/h4r3me2s modifications . again, these findings were in accordance with the situation in mice, where the blimp <dig> protein is downregulated and the h2ar3me2s/h4r3me2s methylation is gradually lost when germ cells proceed to prespermatogonia  <cit> .

since the murine blimp1/prmt <dig> complex was specifically detected in early germ cells but not in prespermatogonia <cit>  we next asked whether prmt <dig>  blimp <dig> and dimethylated histone h2a and h <dig> could be detected in adult human testes. blimp <dig> was detected in the cytoplasm of round spermatids  and prmt <dig> was found in the nuclei and in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes  and round spermatids . h2ar3me2s/h4r3me2s modification is detected in type a spermatogonia , as well as round and elongated spermatids, . the cytoplasmatic localization of blimp <dig> in adult testes excludes the functional interaction with prmt <dig> and the resulting epigenetic modification. this implicates an alternative mechanism of h2ar3me2s/h4r3me2s modification in adult testes.

type ii tgcts
we next examined various tgcts for the presence of blimp1/prmt <dig> and h2ar3me2s/h4r3me2s. as shown in figure  <dig>  igcnu show nuclear blimp <dig> staining , cytoplasmatic prmt <dig> staining  and dimethylation of h2a/h <dig> . seminomas show predominant nuclear blimp <dig> signal  sparse nuclear prmt <dig> signal  as well as a strong and homogenous signal for h2ar3me2s/h4r3me2s . in embryonal carcinoma, expression of blimp <dig>  and prmt <dig>  was weak and cytoplasmatic. as expected, histone h2ar3me2s/h4r3me2s methylation  was barely detectable and heterogeneous. yolk sac tumors teratomas and choriocarcinomas stained focally and cytoplasmatic for blimp <dig> and prmt <dig> . focal cytoplasmatic expression of blimp <dig> and prmt <dig> was also observed in differentiated parts of teratoma, while chorioncarcinomas were negative for both proteins. a summary of the results of the immunohistochemical studies is given in table  <dig> 

n, number of cases; n, nuclear staining; c, cytoplasmatic staining

+ weak; ++ moderate; +++, strong expression; -, no expression detectable

*, only single tumor cells were detected as positive.

in order to quantify the expression of blimp <dig> and prmt <dig> we performed rt-pcr analyses on normal testicular tissue as well as on various tgcts. the rna levels measured were first normalized to βactin and then calculated as relative expression with normal testicular tissue  set at  <dig>  expression of blimp <dig> was significantly higher in igcnu  containing testicular parenchyma and seminoma , but not in embryonal carcinoma  , which was comparable to normal testicular tissue. in contrast, prmt <dig> was moderately higher in igcnu , while embryonal carcinoma  and seminoma  express a similar level of prmt <dig> compared to normal testicular tissue . these data could be confirmed, using a whole genome expression dna-array as reported before  <cit> . here, the same pattern was observed .

finally, we asked whether blimp1/prmt <dig> and modification of histone h2a and h <dig> could be detected in tcam- <dig>  a cell line derived from a seminoma patient  <cit> . here, we were able to detect blimp <dig> in the nucleus, prmt <dig> in the nucleus and the cytoplasm . rt-pcr analyses showed that blimp <dig> and prmt <dig> are expressed in tcam- <dig> cells  and absent jkt <dig> cells, in agreement with affymetrix data . of note, the findings on the jkt- <dig> cell line are in concordance with the conclusion that it is not a seminoma cell line  <cit> . western blot analysis confirmed these results, showing that blimp <dig> and prmt <dig>  as well as the modified histones h2a and h <dig>  can be detected. next, we performed a coip on extracts from tcam- <dig> cells and were able to detect a signal for blimp <dig> in material immunoprecipitated with prmt <dig> antibody . this result demonstrates for the first time that prmt- <dig> and blimp- <dig> interact biochemically.

we had shown, that nuclear blimp <dig> and methylated h2a and h <dig> are expressed in igcnu and seminoma, yet these cells express either little or cytoplasmic prmt <dig> . we speculated that another methytransferase cooperating with blimp <dig> might be able to compensate prmt <dig> function and help in establishing this methylation pattern. prmt <dig> which is like prmt <dig> a type ii methyltransferase seemed a potential candidate since both prmt <dig> and prmt <dig> have been demonstrated to mediate symmetric arginine dimethylation of sm proteins required for the spliceosome  <cit> . the coip experiment , demonstrates that blimp <dig> and prmt <dig> interact biochemically. in addition prmt <dig> shows a strong nuclear signal in tcam- <dig> cells . these results indicate that in germ cell tumors, both prmt <dig> and prmt <dig> might cooperate with blimp <dig> to establish dimethylation of h2a and h <dig> 

discussion
in this study, we analyzed the expression of the putative inhibitor complex of germ cell differentiation blimp <dig> and prmt <dig> on mrna and protein level and the presence of the resulting repressive histone modifications h2a/h4r3me2s in human fetal and adult germ cells as well as tgcts. we found blimp <dig> and prmt <dig> localized in the nuclei of gonocytes, and the latter also in the cytoplasm, and could show the presence of the resulting dimethylation of h2a/h <dig> at arginine  <dig>  in igcnu a strong nuclear signal of blimp <dig> and of h2k3me2s/h4k3me2s was detected, whereas prmt <dig> signal was cytoplasmatic in igcnu and heterogeneous in seminomas.

the expression in fetal gonocytes in humans described here is in concordance to the observations made in mouse  <cit>  indicating a conserved role of the nuclear localized blimp1/prmt <dig> complex between mouse and man. recently the transcriptional repressor blimp <dig> has been shown to be a crucial determinant of the germ cell lineage in mice  <cit> . this krüppel-type zinc-finger containing protein interacts with the arginine methyl-transferase prmt <dig> resulting in a symmetrical methylation at arginine  <dig> of histone h <dig> and h2a . the methylation in turn represses transcription <cit>  and therefore might be important for suppressing the somatic cell fate and keeping germ cells in a pluripotent state. in fact, in mice blimp1-deficent germ cells show inconsistent repression of hoxb <dig>  a hallmark of germ cell specification and fail to express stella a marker of undifferentiated germ cells  <cit> . also, recent studies showed, that abrogation of the drosophila melanogaster homolog of prmt <dig>  capsuleen/dart <dig>  is essential for germ cell specification and maintenance  <cit> . interestingly, blimp <dig> expression is lost in pgcs which are cultured in the presence of basic fgf and lif  <cit>  and gradually become embryonic germ cells  <cit> . hence the blimp1/prmt <dig> interaction resulting in h2a/h <dig> modification might lead to repression of premature differentiation during human fetal germ cell development. as a consequence prolonged expression of blimp1/prmt <dig> could result in persistence of undifferentiated gonocytes into adulthood.

it is believed that those persisting gonocytes give rise to igcnu the common precursor lesion of all type ii tgcts  <cit> . indeed, we detected blimp <dig> protein and the characteristic modification of histones h2a and h <dig> not only in gonocytes but also in igcnu and in seminoma supporting a pgc/gonocyte origin of igcnu and therefore gct  <cit> . prmt <dig> however, is not detectable in nuclei of igcnu, and displays only a sparse nuclear localization in seminoma cells. we found that another type ii protein arginine methyltransferase, prmt <dig> is expressed in tcam <dig> seminoma cells and that prmt <dig> interacts with blimp <dig> as well. so we speculate that in igcnu and seminoma, blimp <dig> recruits prmt <dig> to compensate for the lack of nuclear prmt <dig> to mediate h2a and h <dig> dimethylation.

upon progression of igcnu to nonseminomas signal intensity of blimp <dig> decreased and subcellular localization changed. as a consequence, h2a/h <dig> modification decreased and became heterogeneous in nonseminomas. hence, the loss of the repressive histone modifications allows further uncontrolled differentiation observed in nonseminomas.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together we propose the following model for development of germ cell neoplasia. first, coexpression and nuclear localization of the blimp1/prmt <dig> complex leads to histone h2a/h <dig> dimethylation which results in transcriptional silencing of genes responsible for somatic differentiation in pgcs. upon differentiation to prespermatogonia, this complex is downregulated and the h2a/h <dig> marks are lost. aberrant constitutive histone h2a/h <dig> arginine  <dig> dimethylation allows the cells to escape the regular differentiation program resulting in their persistence into adulthood. these cells eventually progress into igcnu, displaying the h2a/h4r3me2s modification as well. since the subcellular localization of prmt <dig> excludes prmt5-dependent histone h2a/h <dig> modification in igcnu we propose that blimp <dig> might act in cooperation with prmt <dig>  this mechanism persists in seminoma where the h2a/h4r3me2s modifications can be observed which explains the undifferentiated nature of the tumor cells. translocation of blimp <dig> into the cytoplasm leads to breakdown of histone h2a/h <dig> dimethylation and subsequently to the activation of the differentiation programs and therefore the conversion from igcnu into a nonseminomatous germ cell tumors.
