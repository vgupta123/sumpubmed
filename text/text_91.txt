BACKGROUND
variation in human genes is known to affect susceptibility to hiv- <dig> and disease progression following infection  <cit> . hypothesis-based candidate gene studies have been conducted on natural history hiv cohorts established in the 1980s consisting of hiv-infected individuals or individuals at risk of hiv exposure by their inclusion in an hiv risk group  <cit> . this strategy has been highly productive and identified a number of gene variants associated with rate of hiv progression or resistance to infection: the ccr5-Δ <dig> mutation was shown to block hiv acquisition, and hla class i genes were shown to be strongly associated with hiv progression and control of viral replication  <cit> . common variants in the genes encoding ligands for the major hiv co-receptors, immune modifiers  and post-entry restriction factors have been associated with a positive or negative effect on hiv pathogenesis  <cit> . more recently, genome wide association studies  have been used to identify variants associated with infection, control of viral replication, and elite controller status  <cit> .

in addition to genetic association studies, human host genes potentially required for hiv- <dig> infection have been identified using small interfering  rna knockdown screens conducted on cell lines infected with hiv- <dig>  several sirna studies have been independently conducted, each of which involved the knock-down of almost every human gene  <cit> . each of the studies found over  <dig> human genes that were candidates for involvement in hiv- <dig> infection, designated hiv dependency factors . however, there was little overlap in genes found across the studies  <cit> , with only three human genes identified by all three knock-down studies, and  <dig> other genes detected by at least two of the studies  <cit> .

hiv- <dig> derives from simian immunodeficiency viruses  infecting the common chimpanzee, pan troglodytes <cit> . hiv- <dig> sequences are polyphyletic in humans: each of the four hiv- <dig> groups present in humans  is closer in sequence to strains of siv present in the central african subspecies  of the common chimpanzee than they are to hiv- <dig> sequences belonging to other human hiv- <dig> clades   <cit> . this suggests that hiv- <dig> originated in four or more independent cross-species transmissions from the p. t. troglodytes subspecies to humans  <cit> . the natural range of the central african chimpanzee is the congolian forest block of central africa, west of the congo river , suggesting that each of the hiv- <dig> groups may have first infected humans living in this region, subsequently giving rise to the world-wide pandemic  <cit> .

archival medical samples collected in leopoldville  during  <dig> and  <dig> are the earliest documented evidence of hiv- <dig> infections in humans  <cit> . the diversity of hiv- <dig> present in these and in subsequently collected samples has permitted the date of cross-species transmission for hiv- <dig> clade m viruses to be estimated as having occurred between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , with the other major clades originating within similar time frames  <cit> . by contrast the coalescence date for siv strains in chimpanzees may be older than  <dig>  years  <cit> . since siv has recently crossed the species barrier from chimpanzees to humans multiple times  <cit> , we considered whether a virus known to have repeatedly entered human populations would only begin to do so in the past century or two. we hypothesized that the virus may also have repeatedly crossed the species barrier into local human populations before the current pandemic began. simulation studies have suggested that siv would be unlikely to have generated persistent outbreaks in humans in central africa before the appearance of large cities during the colonial era  <cit> . additionally, it is possible that outbreaks prior to the current pandemic would have been extinguished due to the quick susceptibility of immunodeficient individuals to formerly pervasive infectious diseases .

if immunodeficiency viruses had repeatedly affected human populations locally before the current pandemic, this may have generated selection pressure for resistance, which could be reflected in genomic signatures in the chromosomes of the living descendants of the affected populations. in considering this hypothesis, we found that a similar hypothesis had been independently formulated previously  <cit> , but to our knowledge had never been tested. a number of difficulties would be encountered that make it difficult to test our hypothesis. first, any of the methods available to identify regions of the genome under selection would be likely to generate some false positive signals, and there would be uncertainty in the determination of regions of the genome under selection since some signals may result from other demographic factors or from drift. methods to detect selection provide insight into putative regions under selection as an exploratory test, but would not be completely definitive  <cit> . second, there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the identification of genes as human genes associated with hiv- <dig>   <cit>  or as hdfs. in particular  the genes identified as hdfs show little overlap across different studies  <cit> . third, many of the regions of the genome that show signatures of selection may contain multiple genes, and any of these could be responsible for a signal of selection. fourth, selective pressure on host genes that interact with retroviruses would not necessarily be due to hiv- <dig>  but could have been driven by other pathogens, such as other retroviruses known to affect humans or other primates within the african tropical forest  <cit> .

despite these caveats, we sought to test the hypothesis that previous outbreaks of immunodeficiency viruses may have shaped the genomes of some modern african populations. we found that the diverse populations intensively genotyped   <cit>  as part of the human genome diversity panel  included the biaka western pygmies of the central african republic. the biaka have historically resided in communities within the forest range of p. t. troglodytes <cit> . the biaka and other pygmy groups diverged from their bantu neighbors approximately 60– <dig>  years ago  <cit> . archeological evidence has suggested that the western pygmies have been in the congo river basin for at least  <dig>  years  <cit> . it is also likely that the biaka or their ancestors were present in the western congolian rainforest since at least  <dig> years, the time at which current western pygmy populations are estimated to have separated genetically  <cit> , concurrent with the neolithic expansion of nonpygmy agriculturalists  <cit> .

we compared biaka genomes to those of hgdp african populations who live outside the range of p. t. troglodytes, including the mbuti, an eastern pygmy population in the democratic republic of congo. eastern and western pygmy groups diverged genetically ca.  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . the chimpanzee subspecies p.t. schweinfurthii found in the forests inhabited by the mbuti carries strains of siv that fall outside the clades that gave rise to strains of hiv   <cit> . the other hgdp african populations live outside the geographic range of chimpanzee populations that carry siv.

we examined snp data for signatures of selection in the genomes of the biaka around host genes shown to be associated with hiv disease or host genes that appear to interact with hiv in studies using cell lines . we found that the genomic region surrounding the gene cul <dig>  encoding cullin  <dig>  one of the strongest risk predictors of aids progression yet identified by candidate gene analysis  <cit> , displayed a strong signature of recent selection in the biaka. we also found signatures of selection at other hiv-associated genes in the biaka.

RESULTS
we looked for evidence of selection by comparing public snp datasets between biaka western pygmies and mbuti eastern pygmies. we also ran selection scans using three other african populations , running genomic comparisons between each pair of african populations. to look for genomic signatures of selection, we applied a method  that relied on multi-locus heterozygosity within and fst variance between populations   <cit> . the proportion of the genome found to display signatures of selection for each pairwise comparison of populations is listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  due in part to the way that selection tests were conducted, proportions of the genome identified as being under potential selection were similar across pairwise comparisons of different populations, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for autosomes. the comparison between biaka and mbuti pygmy groups produced the lowest estimate for proportion of the genome showing signatures of selection, a total of  <dig> % , perhaps reflecting the genetic affinity of the two pygmy groups  <cit> . in this comparison, new selection in biaka totaled  <dig> % of the autosomes, new selection in mbuti  <dig> %, new selection in both populations  <dig> %, and old selection  <dig> % .

we examined genomic regions that demonstrated signatures of selection for the presence of host genes associated with hiv- <dig> , in which polymorphisms are known to affect hiv infection or outcome  <cit> . these genes had been found using candidate-gene or gwas studies. for gwas studies, only those with genome wide significance of p < 5 × 10- <dig> were further considered, in order to minimize the number of false positives, as suggested by  <cit> . there were  <dig> hgah loci, although some loci included tightly linked gene clusters, so the total number of hgahs was  <dig> clustered at the  <dig> loci, as listed and described in additional file 1: table s <dig>  across the five sub-saharan african populations examined , only five of the ten pairwise comparisons detected any region with signatures of selection overlapping a hgah . these involved four distinct hgahs  that were detected as under putative selection a total of eight times across pairwise comparisons . remarkably, seven of the eight times in which signatures of selection overlapped with the genomic position of one of these genes involved evidence for old or new selection occurring in the biaka population .

we examined the degree to which the number of genes with signatures of selection detected among the hgah listing was unusual relative to genes drawn at random, running a permutation test in which  <dig> genes at different loci were drawn at random and examined using the same test of selection in ten pairwise comparisons of the  <dig> african populations. we found that the probability that randomly drawn genes would overlap  <dig> or more signals of selection in a single population  across the pairwise population comparisons was  <dig> . the probability that among  <dig> genes drawn randomly  <dig> or more  would overlap a signal of selection in at least one of the pairwise comparisons  was p <  <dig> .

both cul <dig> and trim <dig> showed low values of heterozygosity  in the biaka, with high values  for the variance of fst in the genomic regions around each gene in the biaka-mbuti comparison . the genomic region around cul <dig> <cit>  displayed the tenth strongest signal of new selection in biaka in the pairwise comparison involving the two pygmy groups. furthermore, the region under putative selection that included cul <dig> was among the longest  detected using our method . this may be a further indication of strong or recent selection affecting this genomic region, since strong selection can produce a signature across a longer region of the genome  <cit> . the genomic region under putative selection around cul <dig> did not appear to have unusually low or high snp coverage given the length of the region , an indication that this signal of selection was not distorted by unusual snp densities. we also looked for previously published snps  <cit>  in cul <dig> linked to hiv- <dig> risk. the protective allele of the cul <dig> snp rs <dig>  located between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which is associated with delayed aids progression in african americans  <cit> , was found to be fixed across the biaka .

human genes are listed for which a snp reported to be associated with hiv- <dig> outcome was genotyped in the human genome diversity panel . for each snp, allele frequencies are listed for the protective allele in biaka and mbuti.

boldface indicates protective alleles for which the biaka had a higher allele frequency than the mbuti. for coding variants, the amino acid listed after the position is the protective variant. within each pygmy population, all alleles were at hardy-weinberg equilibrium after bonferroni correction .

*indicates that the allele frequency difference between biaka and mbuti is significant  using fisher's exact test.

**indicates that the allele frequency difference between biaka and mbuti is significant after bonferroni correction for multiple tests .

trim <dig> <cit>  was also found in a genomic region demonstrating the signature of ‘new’ selection in the biaka when compared to the mbuti, as well as when the biaka were compared with bantu or mandenka. trim <dig> was also in a genomic region displaying a signature of ‘old’ selection when bantu was compared with mandenka, which was the only case of a hgah under potential selection among comparisons that did not involve the biaka . for trim <dig>  in the biaka-mbuti comparison the length of the region displaying a signature of selection was shorter and the signature of selection was not as strong as for cul <dig> . we looked for previously published snps  <cit>  in trim <dig> associated with hiv- <dig> risk. we found that a protective t allele in the trim <dig> snp rs <dig>  which results in a protective codon-changing mutation in the trim5-alpha protein  <cit> , was present in  <dig> % of biaka chromosomes . this was the highest frequency among african populations, although this allele was more common among non-african than african populations  <cit> .

pard3b <cit>  was in a genomic region showing the signature of ‘old’ selection when biaka were compared with mbuti or yoruba. for pard3b, a significant correlation has been found between the rare t allele for snp rs <dig>  and slower aids progression  <cit> . however, this allele was not more common in biaka  than in other african populations .

the regions identified as under putative selection in comparisons between biaka and mbuti were also examined to identify which of the  <dig> genes previously identified as hdfs or as genes that potentially interact with hiv in host cells  <cit>  would also overlap genomic signatures of selection. a total of  <dig> hdfs were found to overlap regions under potential selection in the biaka, as determined by the biaka-mbuti comparison. these genes are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  hgahs and hdfs under regions of the genome showing signatures of selection for pairwise comparisons across all five african populations are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  in order to minimize the impact of false positives, we had not considered as hgahs those genes identified by gwas that were below a genome-wide significance of p < 5 × 10- <dig> <cit> . however, we included all genes identified by gwas, even those below this cutoff, in a separate analysis. we examined  <dig> genes found by gwas to be associated with hiv- <dig> susceptibility, infection, control and viral set-point as well as aids progression from  <dig> studies  <cit> , including genes that did not meet our criteria for hgahs, and list those genes that overlapped with regions under putative selection between the ten pair-wise comparisons in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

we examined other host genes in which snps previously associated with protection against hiv- <dig> had also been genotyped in the hgdp . including the genes mentioned above, there were five genes in which the snps were part of the coding region , two genes in which a non-coding protective snp was associated with a protective effect in african americans ; and one gene  in which a non-coding snp was associated with a protective effect in europeans. of these  <dig> genes, pard3b was the only one in which mbuti pygmies had a greater frequency of protective alleles than the biaka . the protective allele for the non-synonymous coding variant in apobec3g   <cit>  was among african populations most common in biaka  and significantly  higher in frequency in biaka than mbuti, even after bonferroni correction. among sub-saharan populations, the biaka had the highest frequencies of alleles associated with protection against hiv- <dig> for cul <dig> and for trim <dig>  the two genes showing signatures of new selection in biaka , as well as for apobec3g. the protective alleles were also at higher frequencies  for biaka than mbuti for: the non-synonymous coding variant in apobec3h , for an allele in hla-c associated with protection against hiv- <dig> in both african and european americans  <cit> , for an allele in rpa <dig> associated with protection against hiv- <dig> in european americans  <cit> , and for the non-synonymous protective coding variant rs <dig> of cxcr <dig> <cit>  . for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes, the snps protective against hiv- <dig> were higher in biaka than in mbuti; however, the difference was significant only for apobec3g and cxcr <dig>  and after bonferroni correction only apobec3g frequencies were significantly different .

we examined results from other tests of selection conducted previously on biaka genomes. sabeti et al. have suggested that genomic scans for different signatures of selection are valid across different time scales: tests of selection that examine heterozygosity or population differences can detect more ancient selection than tests relying on linkage disequilibrium  <cit> . given that signatures of selection persist for different lengths of time, we did not expect a high degree of overlap in the genes detected by our study and those that relied on linkage disequilibrium. with this caveat in mind, we identified hgahs and hdfs among the genes reported to be under potential selection by pickrell et al. <cit>  and lopez herraez et al. <cit> , who identified genomic signatures of selection in biaka based on linkage disequilibrium. none of the genes identified by lopez herraez et al. <cit>  as under potential selection in the biaka was a hgah . however, pickrell et al. <cit>  had identified tsg <dig> as having the eighth strongest signal of potential selection among genes in the biaka . it is interesting that our own survey also found that tsg <dig> was in a genomic region showing the signature of old selection when the biaka were compared to mandenka . variation in tsg <dig> has been associated with differences in aids progression rates  <cit> , although the snps used in that study did not overlap with those used by the current study, so that beneficial or detrimental alleles could not be identified in the biaka .

finally, dna from five individuals each of the biaka western pygmies and the mbuti eastern pygmies was available for sequencing. regions of five host genes associated with hiv- <dig>  and two hdfs  were sequenced in these samples. the sample sizes used would only be sufficient for finding high-frequency polymorphisms; however, we did not detect any novel amino acid variants. nonetheless, a high degree of sequence diversity at these genes was evident for both pygmy groups, and we found a novel mutation replacing a rare codon in ccr <dig> , and numerous snps in the promoter regions of each of the hgahs examined, including novel snps and snps that would affect transcription factor binding sites . the ccr2-64i variant, which is associated with a delay in aids progression was found as a heterozygote in one biaka and one mbuti individual, although the ccr5-Δ <dig> variant that is in strong linkage disequilibrium with ccr2-64i in northern europeans and their descendants  <cit>  was, as expected, not present in pygmies.

discussion
the prevalence of hiv- <dig> tends to be lower in african pygmies than in neighboring communities  <cit> , although pygmies are susceptible to hiv- <dig>  which derives from contact with other human groups  <cit> . direct transmission of immunodeficiency viruses from non-human primates has not been detected among bushmeat hunters  <cit> . but these findings do not rule out historical interspecies transmissions of immunodeficiency viruses from chimpanzees to humans, as at least four independent interspecies transmissions within the past two centuries have occurred   <cit> .

signals of putative selection around four human genes associated with hiv- <dig>  were detected eight times in pairwise comparisons among five sub-saharan african populations. seven of the eight signals entailed comparisons involving the biaka pygmy population . of the four hgahs detected by our method as being under putative selection in the biaka  <cit> , cul <dig> demonstrated the strongest signal of selection . cul <dig> codes for the cullin  <dig> protein, which is recruited by hiv- <dig> viral infectivity factor  to form a protein complex that functions as an ubiquitin ligase. the complex that includes cul <dig> targets and suppresses the anti-viral activity of human apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme apobec3g, which is a crucial inhibitor of hiv- <dig>  <cit> . cul <dig> polymorphisms in african americans have been associated with more rapid cd4+ t cell loss following hiv- <dig> infection  <cit> . two snps in this gene have been associated with accelerated progression to aids while one snp has been associated with delayed progression to aids  <cit> . we found cul <dig> under strong selection in the biaka; previous genotyping efforts had included an allele associated with delayed aids progression, which we found to be present in 100% of biaka chromosomes, and 96% of mbuti chromosomes   <cit> .

the largest alternative splicing protein isoform of trim <dig>  trim5-alpha, is essential for primate retroviral capsid recognition and anti-hiv- <dig> activity  <cit> . trim5-alpha is a ring domain-e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that specifically recognizes and prematurely de-coats the hiv- <dig> capsid to deactivate the virus  <cit> . it has been demonstrated to have a secondary function of promoting innate immunity signaling after detection of the hiv- <dig> capsid particle  <cit> . trim5-alpha, in conjunction with the ubc13-uev1a heterodimer, catalyzes the synthesis of unattached k63-linked ubiquitin chains to activate tak <dig> kinase and stimulate ap- <dig> and nfκ-b signaling. interaction with the hiv- <dig> capsid lattice enhances the ubc13-uev1a-dependent e <dig> activity of trim5-alpha  <cit> . interestingly, a rare allele of trim <dig> has previously been detected in the baka western pygmies of southeastern cameroon . that allele, found as a heterozygote in 4% of the baka pygmies results in a truncation of the trim5-alpha peptide lacking the functionally important spry domain, which would have detrimental effects for individuals infected by hiv- <dig>  <cit> . by contrast, in our survey of pygmies we found that a protective mis-sense mutation in trim <dig>   <cit> , which would have beneficial effects for individuals infected by hiv- <dig>  was in the highest frequency in biaka compared to other african populations .

it should be noted that, due to elevated recombination around some important immune response genes, such as hla or kir, our method may not have detected selection in these genes even if it had occurred. additionally, when we examined the hgdp snp data for snps reported as protective against hiv- <dig>  we found that the biaka had higher frequencies of the protective snp than the mbuti for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes with protective snps . although apobec3g was not detected as being under selection, an allele that affects the coding region of apobec3g and is protective against hiv- <dig> was found to have the highest frequency in biaka among african populations . the protein product of apobec3g hypermutates the hiv- <dig> cdna transcript in the absence of the hiv- <dig> accessory factor vif. the h186r codon-changing variant has been associated with decreased susceptibility and reduced rate of progression of hiv- <dig> in african americans  <cit> . a higher frequency of protective alleles was found in the biaka when compared to the mbuti for three other hgahs: apobec3h, cxcr <dig>  and hla-c . the k121e codon-changing variant of the gene apobec3h, which encodes a protein that hypermutates hiv- <dig> transcripts, has been reported to be more effective at restricting hiv- <dig> in vitro <cit> . the e3k codon-changing polymorphism in the gene cxcr <dig>  which encodes a chemokine that is the primary coreceptor for siv, has been associated with increased survival time in african americans with hiv- <dig>  <cit> . the protective rs <dig> allele in the major histocompatibility complex gene hla-c, has been associated with decreased viral load in african americans  <cit> .

several previous studies have reported that african pygmies carry protective copies of other host genes involved with hiv disease. the cc chemokine ligand 3-like  <dig>  protein binds to the hiv coreceptor ccr <dig>  <cit> . copy number variation of the ccl3l <dig> gene is present across human populations. higher copy numbers within african-americans and within european-americans for the ccl3l <dig> gene have been associated with protection against hiv- <dig>  possibly due to competition with the ccr <dig> receptor used by hiv- <dig> to enter cells  <cit> . the biaka have the second highest copy number of ccl3l <dig>  and the mbuti the fourth highest copy number, among  <dig> human populations examined across the world  <cit> . additionally, the ccr <dig> haplotype most commonly found in african pygmies is associated with delayed hiv- <dig> disease progression  <cit> . models have suggested that among pygmies, with both high ccl3l <dig> copy number and protective ccr <dig> alleles, the modern spread of hiv- <dig> might be minimal due to protective genotypes present within their populations  <cit> . if selection for resistance to immunodeficiency viruses has affected some human populations in central africa, this may have been one factor leading to the low prevalence of hiv- <dig> in the region relative to other parts of africa  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, despite small numbers in some studied populations, we found evidence for signatures of recent selection in the biaka western pygmies in genomic regions including cul <dig>  trim <dig>  and tsg <dig> all of which have a functional role in hiv restriction; and for old selection in the genomic region containing pard3b, a gene identified by a gwas. we also found that among  <dig> snps associated with hiv, the biaka had the highest frequency of protective alleles for apobec3g, cul <dig> and trim <dig> among sub-saharan africans, and also had a higher frequency of protective alleles than the mbuti for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes . we established that a ccr2-64i variant associated with a delay in aids progression is carried by some pygmies. previous researchers have reported a high copy number for ccl3l <dig>  in pygmies, while pygmies have high frequencies of the protective, ancestral ccr <dig> haplotype  <cit> . given these findings, the hypothesis that immunodeficiency viruses may have shaped the genomes of west central african human populations appears to merit further investigation.
