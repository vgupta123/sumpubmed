BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen that can cause a wide variety of hospital- and community-acquired infections. in addition, it is also part of the normal flora in 20-40% of adult humans  <cit> . in hospitals throughout the world, antibiotic pressure combined with the adaptive genetic capacity of s. aureus has resulted in the development of lineages with resistance to multiple antimicrobial drugs, including methicillin. hospital-associated methicillin-resistant s. aureus  has become a major source of nosocomial infections and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality  <cit> . however, in the past decade, mrsa has increasingly caused infections and outbreaks outside the hospital setting, particularly among healthy people who lack the known risk factors for mrsa acquisition. these isolates are referred to as community-associated mrsa  and are genetically distinct from ha-mrsa. considerable genetic heterogeneity has been observed among ca-mrsa strains, which contrasts with the presence of a few pandemic clones of ha-mrsa  <cit> . in  <dig>  a new mrsa lineage, sequence type  <dig> , emerged in the community  <cit> . st <dig> isolates can cause several acute infections including benign skin and soft tissue infections, respiratory tract infections, as well as serious life-threatening conditions such as bacteremia and endocarditis  <cit> . recent studies have shown that a major risk factor in st <dig> human infections is a professional relationship with livestock farming, especially with pigs and calves  <cit> . indeed, mrsa st <dig> colonization of these animals is quite common, and overall prevalence rates for pigs are as high as 49%  <cit> . this is the first time that such a large mrsa reservoir was identified outside of a hospital environment. the identification of livestock in mrsa st <dig> transmission is of considerable concern, especially since livestock is thought to be the source of several emerging antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the community. currently, mrsa st <dig> has been identified throughout the world, including countries in europe, north america and asia  <cit> . thus, mrsa st <dig> represents a distinct lineage that has rapidly spread worldwide and is mainly associated with animal colonization in livestock farming. however, this isolate is also able to colonize and cause invasive disease in humans. therefore, the entire genome sequence of an st <dig> isolate was determined and compared with other s. aureus genomes, in order to identify genetic traits that may explain the success of this global lineage.

RESULTS
the mrsa st <dig> genome consists of a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp, as well as  <dig> circular plasmids. the size of the chromosome is comparable to that of other sequenced s. aureus strains. we identified  <dig>  orfs,  <dig> ribosomal rna operons, and  <dig> mobile genetic elements, including  <dig> insertion sequence  elements. the general features of the genome are summarized in table  <dig>  in total,  <dig> predicted genes had no significant homologues in public databases. the accessory component of the genome is mainly represented within  <dig> mobile genetic elements on the chromosome and in the three plasmids. most of these genetic elements carry virulence and resistance genes involved in colonization and pathogenesis, and are likely acquired horizontally as indicated by integration at specific loci and/or the presence of recombinase genes, flanking direct repeats, as well as gc content. as observed in other s. aureus genomes, the majority of unique genes are encoded on allotypes of known mobile genetic elements.

a  <dig> kb type v  staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec , which contains the meca gene that confers methicillin resistance, is inserted at the characteristic chromosomal integration site  of mrsa s <dig>  type v sccmec is characterized by the presence of a ccrc gene in the ccr gene complex, which encodes a site-specific recombinase that is required for excision and integration of the sccmec element that is flanked by direct repeats containing the integration site sequence  <cit> . the s <dig> sccmec element appears to be composed of gene clusters that have been previously described for other scc elements . the variable non-essential joining  <dig>  region harbors a second intact ccrc gene complex directly downstream of orfx. this region is similar to the ccrc complex in scchg  <cit> . although scchg contains a truncated ccrc gene, it can still be mobilized due to the presence of flanking integration site sequences, while the neighboring type iii sccmec element may provide a recombinase. similar alternative excision has been described for another mrsa strain carrying a type iv sccmec with additional integration site sequences  <cit> . however, type v sccmec in mrsa s <dig> should be considered a composite element because it lacks the additional integration site sequence that is required for alternative excision of the two elements. in addition, within region j <dig>  the sccmec element of s <dig> carries a copa gene that may confer copper resistance. this gene was previously found only in the sccpbp <dig> element of staphylococcus epidermidis atcc  <dig>  <cit> . finally, a truncated metallo-hydrolase gene complex, similar to staphylococcus hominis scc <dig> was also identified in this isolate.

type v  sccmec elements with a ccrc gene containing j <dig> region have recently been found in a mrsa st <dig> isolate  and a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolate . each of these isolates has an integration site sequence at orfx which is identical to that of the sccmec element in s <dig>  however, they possess numerous snps in the intergenic region upstream of the first is <dig> element and in the final two orfs of the ccrc complex. furthermore, the content of the j <dig> region is unique for all three elements and a transposon is also integrated into the sccmec of mrsa st <dig> 

immediately downstream of sccmec is a second  <dig>  kb pseudo-scc element that is integrated into orfx . although it is flanked by scc-specific integration site sequences, this second element lacks any ccr genes suggesting that it depends on the sccmec encoded recombinase for excision. the pseudo-scc element carries  <dig> orfs of which three show no homology to any known genes and  <dig> represent a gene cluster with homology to integrative conjugative elements . this gene cluster is also present in the s. aureus genomes of col, usa <dig> fr <dig> and mrsa <dig>  but is always integrated at integration sites not related to an scc element. recently, one example of this  <dig> gene cluster has been described in association with an scc element. it was integrated into the j <dig> region of a type ii sccmec from isolate jcsc <dig>  however, the gene cluster was integrated without scc-specific integration site sequences and lacks the additional three orfs that flank the pseudo-scc element in s <dig> 

two nearly identical bacteriophages of approximately  <dig> kb, φsa6s <dig> and φsa2s <dig>  have integrated into the chromosome at the lipase gene and a hypothetical protein, respectively. the attachment site and integrase of φsa6s <dig> and φsa2s <dig> were similar to those of the φcol and φsa <dig> family, respectively. the two phages demonstrated considerable differences at the terminal ends, which include the integrase and endolysin genes. the domains that were common to both bacteriophages had a mosaic structure and consisted mainly of genes encoding phage regulatory, tail and capsule proteins. we were not able to identify any known virulence gene besides nwmn <dig>  which is a virulence associated gene previously identified in the phages of s. aureus newman. the remarkable presence of two highly homologous phages has only been described once before in the s. aureus newman strain  <cit> .

three transposons were integrated into the core chromosome. a transposon similar to tn <dig> of enterococcus faecalis carries the tet tetracycline resistance element and a gene cluster required for conjugative transfer. the second transposon, tn <dig>  encodes an inducible β-lactamase and its regulator components. both elements are commonly detected in tetracycline- and β-lactam-resistant staphylococci, respectively. a third transposon showed similarity with the tn <dig> transposon family. members of this family are usually found in gram-negative bacteria. however, recently tn7-like transposons have been reported in gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus cereus and staphylococci  <cit> . it is unknown which function are encoded by the tn7-like transposon in s <dig> as it lacks typical genes that are known to confer antibiotic resistance or enhance pathogenesis.

two nearly identical  <dig> kb putative mobile genetic elements were integrated into the genome. one was contained in the pseudo-scc element while the other was integrated into the acyl-coenzyme a ligase gene. the integration appears to result in the duplication of  <dig> nucleotides. furthermore, nearly identical elements were also integrated in the usa <dig> fpr <dig>  mrsa <dig> and col genomes, as well as type ii sccmec from the isolate jcsc <dig>  the element contains  <dig> orfs, which includes proteins with conserved domains related to amidase, atpase, dna translocase, a replication initiation factor and a gene with a frame-shift encoding an integrase. frame-shifts among integrase genes have been previously reported  <cit> . these frame-shifts are reversible and are thought to contribute to the regulation of the transfer of the genetic element. nine of the  <dig> proteins demonstrate similarity with those found in integrative and conjugative elements from bacillus subtilis  and listeria monocytogenes  . indeed, the circularized form of the element was detected by pcr  suggesting that this element can be excised from the chromosome and may be transferred by conjugation with subsequent integration into the recipient. we named these elements, icesa1a and icesa1b. a third similarly organized element containing a cluster of genes homologous to icesa <dig> was integrated into a conserved hypothetical protein and named, icesa <dig> . however, we did not identify any known virulence genes in these three elements.

a novel staphylococcal pathogenicity island , designated as sapi-s <dig>  was also identified. this sapi was integrated into the same conserved  <dig> bp attachment site as sapibov  and composed at the 5'-end of sequences homologous to sapibov and sapi <dig> . these sequences encode genes involved in transcription, replication and packaging . a unique region at the 3'-end of sapi-s <dig> was identified to encode two putative extracellular proteins with similarity to staphylococcal complement inhibitor  and von willebrand factor-binding protein , respectively. both proteins also have a conserved homologue in the core genome of s <dig>  the other genes identified on sapi-s <dig> were a putative primase and hypothetical phage related genes.

novel allelic variants of νsaα and νsaβ islands were also identified. both of these νsa islands are present in all s. aureus genomes and each is integrated at a conserved position in the chromosome. there are considerable differences between the strains with respect to the genetic content of the νsa islands. however, a key element that has been observed in each νsa island is a type i restriction-modification  system. the presence of two r-m systems effectively prevents horizontal gene transfer into the genome and limits dna transfer between s. aureus isolates to those of the same lineage  <cit> . although both types of νsa islands are present in the s <dig> genome, only νsaα harbors a type i r-m system, which has a unique hsds gene that encodes the s subunit which determines the sequence specificity of type i r-m systems. the νsaα island also contains a staphylococcal superantigen-like  family of exotoxins as well as a family of lipoproteins. the proteins of the sll family may play a role in innate immunity evasion, as ssl <dig> inhibits p-selectin-mediated neutrophil rolling and ssl <dig> binds iga and complement factor c <dig>  <cit> . to our knowledge, a function for the family of lipoproteins has not yet been described. the νsaβ island harbors a hyaluronidase gene cluster that was also present in the bovine derived s. aureus strain, et <dig>  this cluster encodes a variant of the hyaluronidase encoded on the core genome of s. aureus. hyaluronidase is a proposed virulence factor that is capable of degrading hyaluronic acid, a major component of the extracellular matrix in connective tissue, and thereby contributes to subcutaneous bacterial spread from the initial site of infection. alternatively, the degradation products of hyaluronic acid may serve as a supply of nutrients for the organism  <cit> . the νsaβ island lacks enterotoxins, serine proteases, lantibiotic biosynthesis proteins and luke/d hemolysins.

the genome of s <dig> contained three plasmids. a tetracycline resistance determinant tet is carried on plasmid ps0385- <dig>  which is highly similar to pusa <dig> from s. aureus usa <dig> frp <dig>  a second plasmid carries a str gene which confers streptomycin resistance. finally, a small cryptic plasmid was also identified .

discussion
analysis of the genome of s. aureus strain s <dig>  a member of the livestock-associated mrsa st <dig> lineage, showed considerable differences relative to other s. aureus genome sequences. the majority of these differences were identified in unique or novel allotypes of mobile genetic elements. this finding stresses the importance of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial genome remodeling, as previously reported for other sequenced s. aureus genomes. many of these mobile genetic elements harbor determinants for virulence and antimicrobial resistance which may allow the bacterium to adapt to new niches. it should be noted that some mobile elements such as sapi-s <dig>  icesa <dig>  icesa <dig>  and phagesa <dig> do not appear to be present in the majority of  <dig> spa-types of mrsa st <dig>  as determined by pcr analysis for specific genes within these elements. however, the tet transposon, νsa encoded hyaluronidase, plasmid encoded streptomycin resistance and type v sccmec encoded ccrc were identified in the majority of these isolates .

the presence of  <dig> different antimicrobial resistance elements, either integrated into the chromosome or located on plasmids, may reflect the relatively high antibiotic pressure in livestock farming. two tetracycline resistance determinants, tet on tn <dig> and tet on ps0385- <dig>  were present in this mrsa isolate. the presence of two of these determinants may confer a higher level of resistance to tetracycline. tetracycline resistance is most likely responsible for the selection of st <dig> isolates. therapeutic treatment of pigs with oxytetracycline and the treatment of a complete flock with prophylactic oxytetracycline are both common practices in pig farming  <cit> . furthermore, a novel type v sccmec, which encodes methicillin resistance, and harbors two distinct ccrc genes as well as a unique j <dig> region, was also identified. recent reports have identified type v sccmec elements in ca-mrsa st <dig> and s. pseudintermedius that harbor two ccrc genes  <cit> . the ccrc encoded recombinase is required for the excision of scc elements flanked by characteristic integration site sequences from the chromosome, and insertion into another chromosome. integration site sequences were not found in the sequences between the  <dig> ccrc genes, suggesting that it is a single scc element. the presence of two ccrc genes in a single element may enhance recombinase production resulting in an increase in the rate of sccmec excision, since over expression of ccra/b leads to increased excision of sccmec elements  <cit> . increased cassette chromosome recombinase c production may lead to an increased probability of sccmec transfer between staphylococci. in addition, sccmec in s <dig> carries a putative copper resistance gene complex that is also present in the scc element of s. epidermidis atcc  <dig>  copper is commonly used as a growth enhancer in pig farming  <cit> . therefore, the presence of copper resistance genes may contribute to bacterial survival in this niche. the distinct genetic organization of sccmec in s <dig> is most likely derived from a complex series of recombination and rearrangement processes.

s. aureus's acquisition of dna from other bacterial species is not very common, which is illustrated by the limited number of s. aureus lineages that have acquired sccmec or vana transposon resulting in mrsa and vancomycin-resistant s. aureus, respectively  <cit> . although s. aureus has features that prevent foreign dna acquisition, some strains appear to be more prone to serve as recipients of dna transfer than others. in s <dig>  two potential mechanisms that may increase the transfer and acquisition of foreign dna were identified. one factor is the absence of a type i r-m system on νsaβ. other sequenced strains possess an r-m system on both νsa α and β islands. restriction-modification systems have been postulated to be one of the key elements that prevent foreign dna integration into the host genome by degradation of dna that is not methylated by the r-m system's modification enzyme. indeed, strains that harbor a dysfunctional type i r-m system are significantly more prone to accept foreign dna via conjugation  <cit> .

another factor that may influence the acquisition of foreign dna is the presence of three ices in the s <dig> genome. one of these ices is present in a pseudo-scc element flanked by integration site sequences and integrated into orfx. ice encoded proteins form a type iv secretion-like system , which is a multi-protein complex that can hydrolyze the peptidoglycan layer of the cell-wall and transfer single-stranded dna through both the cell wall and cell membrane. this dna transfer model supports the hypothesis that ice-encoded secretion systems are involved in conjugative dna transport, which has been previously demonstrated for the pip <dig> plasmid in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . however, homologues of the transfer genes  of pip <dig> could not be identified in the s <dig> isolate. alternatively, t4sls may be involved in protein transport across the cell-wall of the bacterium. the presence of an ice may have contributed to the acquisition of sccmec by s <dig>  in addition, the ice may also contribute to further transmission of sccmec and also enhance the transfer of other mobile elements into new hosts. the tremendous diversity of resistance patterns observed among st <dig> isolates suggests that they are able to horizontally acquire foreign dna quite easily under antibiotic pressure  <cit> .

the existence of s. aureus lineages with a broad host range, such as st <dig>  suggests that the bacterial genome can adapt to the host by acquiring specific  genes or altering gene expression. a recent publication regarding the bovine s. aureus et <dig> genome suggested that the adaptation of some core genes and acquisition of sapibov containing genes that encode tsst- <dig> as well as a variant of enterotoxin c, contributed to host and tissue specificity  <cit> . in s <dig> we identified sapi-s <dig>  which harbors homologues of the scn and vwb genes, both of which encode exoproteins . scin, a product of scn encoded on φsa <dig>  inhibits complement activation via the classical, alternative and lectin pathways by blocking both the c4b2a and c3bbb c3-convertases. it is human-specific as it does not inhibit complement activation in other species, including pigs  <cit> . scin encoded on sapi-s <dig> may demonstrate a broader host range or possibly be pig-specific, which would enable st <dig> isolates to inhibit complement activation in their current animal hosts. the vwb homologue on sapi-s <dig> encodes a protein similar to vwbp which binds von willebrand factor   <cit> . the multifunctional vwf protein plays an important role in hemostasis as it mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation to exposed subendothelium and also binds and stabilizes coagulation factor viii. the vwbp not only interacts with vwf, but also binds and activates prothrombin without cleaving it, which is the normal pathway for prothrombin activation  <cit> . the resulting complex can cleave fibrinogen and the resulting fibrin then contributes to the clotting process. thus, vwbp contributes to clotting via two independent mechanisms. in addition, surface-bound s. aureus protein a also interacts with vwf. the presence of both surface bound and soluble proteins that bind vwf may increase the ability of s. aureus to adhere at sites of vascular damage, thereby helping the bacterium to gain entry into the host and cause infections. the vwbp encoded in the core genome shows some host-specificity, however both human and porcine serums exhibit comparable coagulation rates after the addition of vwbp  <cit> . the contribution of sapi-encoded vwbp is not completely understood. however the presence of a second vwb gene may increase clotting activity or help broaden host specificity.

interestingly, the mrsa st <dig> lineage, which has successfully colonized livestock around the world, seems to lack a large number of well known virulence factors such as enterotoxins and other phage encoded toxins. these results have been confirmed by a recent study that genotyped  <dig> mrsa st <dig> pig isolates using a diagnostic dna microarray that includes virulence genes and microbial surface components that recognize adhesive matrix molecules  <cit> . nevertheless, we identified several additional genes that encode for potential virulence factors such as hyaluronidase, scin and vwbp.

CONCLUSIONS
the absence of virulence factors may explain why mrsa st <dig> isolates have caused relatively little disease until now. however, the hypothesized enhanced ability of mrsa st <dig> to acquire mobile genetic elements may also result in the uptake of mobile elements that encode virulence genes. for example, the first panton-valentine leukocidin -positive mrsa st <dig> isolates have recently been reported  <cit> . considering the vast and increasing animal and human reservoirs, we believe it will only be a matter of time before more of these isolates acquire mobile genetic elements that carry virulence factors which will increase virulence in the human host.
