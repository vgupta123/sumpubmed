BACKGROUND
eukaryotic cells are characterized by a high degree of compartmentalization and most protein activities can be assigned to particular cellular compartments. moreover, the accurate functions of protein interaction networks rely greatly on the proper localization of each protein component. in many cases, aberrant translocation of proteins correlates highly with pathological changes in cell physiology. until recently, protein localization experiments have been confined to only one or a few particular genes of interest. the first large-scale localization study in mammalian cells was performed in microwell-plate format by simpson et al. and included  <dig> human genes  <cit> . recently, an automated transfection and immunostaining system for 96-well plates has been established  <cit> . a microwell-plate-based approach, however, is associated with a high consumption of reagents and a requirement for extensive automation. a recently developed transfected cell array  technique  <cit>  represents a cost-effective alternative for high-throughput approaches in functional genomics. the principle of the tca technique is based on the transfection of dna or rna molecules, immobilized on a solid surface, into mammalian cells. subsequently, detection of the physiological effects on these cells caused by the introduction of foreign nucleic acid is carried out  <cit> . we optimized this platform for high-throughput protein co-localization studies and applied it to the characterization of human chromosome  <dig>  encoded proteins.

functional analysis of chr <dig> proteins is of great medical relevance. this refers, in particular, to trisomy of human chr <dig>  which results in down's syndrome, a complex developmental and neurodegenerative disease. the phenotype of down's syndrome includes various organ malformations, stereotypic craniofacial anomalies and brain malformations  <cit> . molecular analysis of this syndrome, however, poses a particular challenge, because the aneuploid region of chr <dig> contains genes of unknown function. genomic sequencing and gene expression analysis of human chr <dig>  <cit> , as well as study of the transcriptome of a down's syndrome mouse models  <cit> , provide a comprehensive resource for the systematic functional characterization of chr <dig> genes. however, functional characterization at the protein level has been performed most often using protein prediction algorithms. therefore, determination of the subcellular protein distribution would provide an important insight into the function of human chr <dig> genes. in the present study,  <dig> human chr <dig> genes were analyzed for subcellular localization of protein using a tca technique . furthermore, changes in cellular phenotypes, such as cell morphology and proliferation, could be identified as a consequence of over-expression of some of these genes.

RESULTS
subcellular localization of chr <dig> proteins
in order to ensure that the localization of the expressed proteins has not been influenced by the cell array protocol or his <dig> tagging, genes coding for proteins with well-described localization to particular cellular compartments were reverse transfected and over-expressed. the control genes encoded for the cdh <dig>  kdelr <dig>  lmna, pex11a, tgn <dig> and egfp proteins  <cit> . all control proteins have been detected in the locations as described  <cit> .

the subcellular localization pattern for  <dig> out of  <dig> chr <dig> proteins was determined using his <dig> epitope detection. the rest of the proteins could not be detected, as their expression remains below the detection level of the cell array. the subcellular distribution for mammalian cells of  <dig> detected proteins is described here for the first time. a summary of the localization data is presented in table  <dig> , together with the protein and gene accession numbers, and information on gene function and expression patterns. localization images can be visualized and downloaded from  <cit> . in order to exclude the possibility that the fusion of the his <dig> tag at the protein n terminus influenced its localization, the chr <dig> open reading frames  have been cloned with a myc epitope tag at the c terminus. the localization of the c terminus-tagged proteins did not substantially differed from the localization pattern of n terminus-tagged proteins .

a significant proportion of the proteins localized either in the cytosol  or in the nucleus . in all, 23% of proteins were found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, or were found to translocate between these two compartments. localization of 29% of the proteins was associated with components of the endoplasmic reticulum  secretory pathway, including the er , the golgi  and endosome/lysosome compartment ; 10% of proteins were localized in the plasma membrane . figure  <dig> shows localization examples of chr <dig> proteins in different cellular compartments. in what follows, several features of protein distribution are discussed.

cytosol
two distinct localization features were observed for cytosolic proteins. proteins were either distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm or formed a punctate pattern of distribution. for example, the hlcs gene codes for a biotin-protein ligase and was found to localize throughout the cytosol . another protein, myxovirus resistance protein  <dig>  which is encoded by the mxa gene, revealed a punctate pattern in the cytosol, which does not overlap with any organelle staining. the accumulated localization pattern of mxa in our study supports previous suggestions that self-assembled mxa proteins wrap around or interact with the incoming viral nucleocapsids and thereby prevent their replication  <cit> . accola et al. reported that the mxa protein localizes to the smooth er and might inhibit viral replication through alterations in membrane organization  <cit> . we did not, however, observe the co-localization of mxa with the er marker, protein disulphide isomerase  .

nucleus
the non-histone chromosomal protein hmg- <dig>  which is encoded by the hmgn <dig> gene, was found in the nucleus but outside of the nucleolus . this localization correlated with its suggested function as a modulator of the interaction between dna and the histone octamer through the binding of hmg- <dig> to nucleosomal dna. in contrast, the novel nuclear protein  <dig>  localized exclusively in the nucleolus, in accordance with its role in the synthesis of  <dig> s rrna   <cit> .

nucleus and cytoplasm
in all, 23% of chr <dig> proteins were found to localize in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. the nucleus/cytoplasm distribution ratio for a particular protein, however, varied from cell to cell. in some cells, the proteins with dual localization could be found either only in the nucleus or only in the cytoplasm, suggesting a continuous translocation activity. for example, the variable distribution of the mcm3ap protein  in the nucleus and cytoplasm  correlates with its role in the translocation of mcm <dig> proteins from the cytosol into the nucleus. the mcm <dig> protein is known to be an essential factor that allows dna to undergo a single round of replication per cell cycle  <cit> . the requirement for nuclear import of mcm <dig> protein changes according to the phase of the cell cycle, which is probably reflected by variable distribution of mcm3ap between the nucleus and the cytosol  <cit> .

er-associated secretory pathway
pm proteins, lysosome proteins and secretory proteins are first targeted to er and then to the golgi apparatus for modifications before being transported elsewhere. in contrast, proteins that are resident in the er and the golgi are retrieved and retained in these two organelles. for example, the tmprss <dig> protein , which mutation results in autosomal recessive neurosensory deafness was found to localize exclusively in the er , as described  <cit> .

for some proteins, the entire protein-processing pathway could be traced throughout different organelles. good examples are two integral pm proteins that are encoded by the kcne <dig>  and kcne <dig> genes, both of which belong to the potassium channel, voltage-gated, isk-related subfamily. figure 3a shows consecutive steps of kcne <dig> protein maturation, with its final destination being the pm, where it acts as a k2+ channel. here, we report for the first time, that these proteins localize also to the lysosomes. this co-localization of kcne <dig> protein with the lysosome marker lamp <dig>   could reflect the ability of the pm proteins to shuttle between the pm and the endosome/lysosome compartment. alternatively, the lysosomal location of kcne <dig> and kcne <dig> proteins could result from their direct transport from the golgi to the lysosome. it is not clear which of the two mechanisms accounts for this dual localization pattern. interestingly, the kcnj <dig> potassium channel protein, which is a member of subfamily j, never showed the lysosomal resident pattern and localized at the pm only in the same cell array experiment .

cell cycle-dependent protein translocation
in the case of the bach <dig> and chaf1b proteins, we observed a cell cycle-dependent localization pattern. regarding the bach <dig> protein, we observed a complex cell division-dependent localization pattern. at interphase, bach <dig> was distributed in the entire cytosol. during the early phase of mitosis, however, the protein accumulated in the vicinity of condensing chromatin . the chromatin assembly factor i p <dig> subunit  protein translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm during cell division . as reported  <cit> , we observed most of the chaf1b protein localizing in the nucleus at interphase, where it is involved in chromatin assembly and dna replication. after cytokinesis had occurred, we detected the presence of the chaf1b protein in the cytoplasm of two daughter cells, probably in its inactive form after dissociation from chromatin.

the effects of protein over-expression on cell morphology
clusters of cells transfected with gene cldn <dig> or cldn <dig> were found to undergo morphological changes. overexpression of fifty of the  <dig> proteins was not associated with any abnormal cell morphology.

claudins comprise one of the two major integral membrane protein families that are found in the tight junctions of epithelial cells and endothelial cell sheets. there are more than  <dig> members of the human claudin gene family, which are characterized by heterogeneous tissue localization patterns  <cit> . daugherty et al. found that translocation of claudin- <dig> from the pm to an intracellular compartment helps to regulate tight junction permeability during the differentiation of human fetal lung alveolar epithelial cells to a type ii cell phenotype  <cit> . loss of human claudin- <dig> results in autosomal recessive deafness  <cit> . furthermore, loss of claudin- <dig> may initiate cilia degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium  <cit>  and correlates with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  <cit> . despite the clinical relevance of the claudin proteins, their structure within tight junctions and the regulatory mechanisms of protein expression is not entirely understood. here, we report for the first time subcellular localization data for claudin- <dig>  which localizes predominantly at the pm . the localization of claudin- <dig> has been described recently  <cit> . we observed several morphological changes of hek <dig> cells as a result of over-expression of these proteins. expression of claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig>  but not claudin- <dig>  resulted in loss of cell-membrane protrusions and cell retraction. moreover, a distinct change in nuclear shape could be observed in cells expressing claudin- <dig>  and claudin- <dig>  but not in those expressing claudin- <dig> .

subcellular localization of  <dig> chr <dig> proteins is reported here for the first time. figure  <dig> shows the localization patterns of four selected proteins that are encoded by the c21orf <dig>  dscr <dig>  pcp <dig> and sh3bgr genes . the c21orf <dig> protein was predicted to be an integral membrane protein. indeed, we determined its localization in the pm. the dscr <dig> gene has significant homology to the hbeta <dig> mouse gene, which is active in embryogenesis  <cit> . in our study, the dscr <dig> protein was found in the nucleus, suggesting that it functions in the regulation of transcription or in the maintenance of nuclear structure. the pcp <dig> gene encodes brain-specific polypeptide pep- <dig>  which has a key role in brain development  <cit> . a precise function of the pep- <dig> in this process has not, however, been determined. here, we report localization of the pep- <dig> in the cytosol and in the nucleus .

in chr <dig> trisomic cells, genes are usually over-expressed by  <dig> -fold in comparison to diploid cells. there are, however, some exceptions, as described recently  <cit> . the sh3bgr and kcne <dig> genes showed a  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold increase of expression in the kidney and midbrain, respectively, in the down's syndrome mouse model. in our study, the sh3bgr protein revealed a uniform localization pattern in the cytosol . as described above, the kcne <dig> protein showed a variable distribution pattern, probably due to the differential level of expression in particular cells . the abundance of the kcne <dig> protein in the pm was lower than that in the lysosome/endosome . this abundance-dependent protein localization pattern might be particularly relevant in the case of chr <dig> trisomic cells, which over-express the kcne <dig> gene. this hypothesis, however, needs further functional evaluation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides comprehensive information on the subcellular distribution of human chr <dig> proteins and the physiological effects following over-expression for some of these genes. this cell phenotype-based information should contribute to further understanding of the molecular pathology of down's syndrome. the study has not been performed in human chr <dig> trisomic cells due to difficulties in reverse transfection of primary cells or immortalized primary cells. nevertheless, the data provided in this report may serve as a reference for comparative studies concerning aberrations of protein localization as a result of trisomy  <dig>  cellular localization of many chr <dig> proteins is described here for the first time. together with gene expression profiling and in situ hybridization data, knowledge about the protein compartmentalization pattern should contribute to creation of an integrated picture of chr <dig> molecular biology. furthermore, the large-scale localization data obtained in this study support the concept of application of array-based gene expression systems for the evaluation of protein functions on a single-cell level. it shows a versatility of the cell array technology for analysis of gene sets at various levels of genetic information flow. for example, cell arrays allow for parallel gene silencing  <cit>  or cellular localization studies of large gene sets, resulting in cost-effective characterization of protein functions on a genomic scale.

the cell array technology applied in this study has some limitations. currently, only adhesive cells growing as a monolayer can be used for reverse transfection. moreover, efficient transfection of primary cells such as fibroblasts or macrophages remains a substantial obstacle. recently published lentivirus-based "reverse transduction" of the cells could dramatically improve dna delivery into those difficult-to-transfect cells  <cit> . taking advantage of wide cellular tropism of the lentiviruses, a variety of cell types could be reverse transfected using a single vector construct.

regarding therapeutic purposes, a cell array-based high-throughput localization platform might facilitate the functional screening of chemical compounds that interfere with the expression and translocation of the proteins involved in a particular disease. we believe that cell array-based, high-throughput screening of large genes sets, based on both gene over-expression and knockdown, will accelerate functional analysis of the vast amount of sequence information that has emerged as a result of genome sequencing projects.
