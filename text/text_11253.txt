BACKGROUND
small-rna -mediated pathways form a fundamental layer of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulatory network whose complexity is not fully realized  <cit> . the core of this process of rna interference  involves the formation of the rna-induced silencing complex  with the help of two major factors. the first factor is the growing class of 18- <dig> nucleotide  non-coding smrnas, such as micrornas , and small-interfering rnas   <cit> . these smrnas act as sequence specific guides for the second component, the agos  <cit> . agos have been implicated as proteins essential in the gene regulatory mechanisms fundamental to developmental and cellular processes such as mrna stability/degradation, protein synthesis, and genomic integrity  <cit> . the ago proteins have characteristically four domains: an n-terminal domain, the paz domain, the mid domain and the piwi domain  <cit> . the c-terminus of the protein harbors the mid-piwi lobes. mid-domains have a ‘nucleotide specificity loop’ that is involved in recognition and binding of the 5’phosphate of smrnas, whereas the piwi domains harbor the capacity to slice due to their characteristic catalytic tetrad, 'd-e-d-h/d', at the active site  <cit> . the 2-nt overhang at the 3' end of mirnas is recognized by and anchored in the groove of the hydrophilic cleft of the paz domain  <cit> . the n-terminus probably facilitates the separation of smrna-mrna duplex as well as may regulate the slicer activity on the target mrna by interacting with the 3’ end of the guide rna, as recently shown for drosophila melanogaster agos  <cit> .

an ago was originally discovered in forward genetic screens for genes involved in development in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . yet, little is known about the evolutionary diversification of these proteins across different plant genomes. in eukaryotes, agos are broadly classified into two paralogous families: the ago family, which have similarities to the founder member, ago <dig> of the arabidopsis, and the piwi-like proteins, related to d. melanogaster ‘p-element induced wimpy testis’  proteins  <cit> . while plants have been reported to encode only the ago-like paralogs, animal genomes harbor representatives of both groups, whereas amoebozoa are reported to have only piwi-like genes  <cit> . a third group of agos is specific to caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . these findings suggest that both the families have experienced lineage-specific losses  <cit> . the number of ago genes varies from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; the ago genes seem to have undergone multiple gene duplication events, but mainly in plant genomes  <cit> . plants such as chlamydomonas reinhardtii and physcomitrella patens  contain  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively  <cit> , whereas ‘higher plants’ such as oryza sativa  and a. thaliana  contain  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively  <cit> . in a phylogenetic classification based on protein similarity,  <dig> atagos were distributed into  <dig> phylogenetic clades  <cit> , whereas  <dig> ago genes of o. sativa were divided into  <dig> clades  <cit> . however a comprehensive classification of plant agos is still missing.

in plants, duplication events may have resulted in functional diversification of agos as well as their biochemical activities  <cit> . for instance, of the  <dig> agos in arabidopsis, catalytic activities have been demonstrated for only ago <dig>  ago <dig>  ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig>  <cit> . atago <dig> and atago <dig> preferentially bind to smrnas with a 5'-uridine , whereas atago <dig>  atago <dig>  atago <dig> and atago <dig> prefer smrnas having a 5'-adenine   <cit> , while atago <dig> has greater affinity to 5'-cytosine  containing smrna  <cit> . atago <dig> preferentially binds to smrnas of 21-nt length, whereas atago <dig>  atago <dig> and atago <dig> bind to 24-nt endogenous smrnas  <cit> . atago <dig> binds to mirnas that are processed by dcl <dig> and ta-sirna processed by dcl <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, 82% of smrnas that associate with atago <dig> are mirnas  <cit> , whereas, approximately  <dig>   <dig> and 5% of mirnas are associated with atago <dig>  atago <dig> and atago <dig>  respectively  <cit> . atago <dig> has preferences for mirnas that are processed by dcl <dig>  <cit> . atago <dig>  atago <dig> and atago <dig> participate in the rna-directed dna methylation pathway  <cit> , whereas atago <dig> and atago <dig> play a role in virus resistance  <cit> . the large number of ago genes suggests that the smrna regulatory pathways in plants has undergone substantial diversification and evolution.

other than in arabidopsis, agos have been reported in other plant species such as rice, maize, and tomato. these genes, however, have yet been identified in the ecological model plant nicotiana attenuata in which the smrna machinery is known to mediate important ecological traits such as herbivore resistance, competitive ability and uv-b tolerance  <cit> . here, we identify the ago family of genes in n. attenuata , a plant that grows in agricultural primordial niches and is an important model system for the study of plant-herbivore interactions. further, we investigated the occurrence of ago proteins in  <dig> plant species to identify  <dig> new ago proteins in plants. using integrative biology approach  involving molecular phylogenies, consensus sequence comparisons, signature determination, substitution rate estimations and divergence analysis, we propose a model for the evolutionary history of the ago family of proteins in plants.figure  <dig> 
summary of sequential steps adapted to study evolution of agos in plants. a total of  <dig> ago sequences from  <dig> plant species were used in this analysis. additionally,  <dig> agos from t. castaneum, and  <dig> each from human  and k. polysporus  were also used  to create the ‘ago dataset i’, comprising a total of  <dig> ago sequences. the list of agos for each species is available in additional file  <dig>  after msa and trimming of poorly aligned regions or large gaps, ‘ago dataset ii’ was generated to contain  <dig> sequences  and  <dig> positions .



RESULTS
data set assembly and identification of new agos in plant genomes
we began with the isolation of  <dig> unique, full length ago gene homologs  from n. attenuata. putative naagos showed high identity to  <dig> types of atagos and were thus annotated accordingly as naago <dig> , naago <dig> , naago <dig> , naago <dig> , naago <dig> , naago <dig> , naago <dig>  and naago <dig> . for naago <dig>  three gene sequences shared >78% peptide identity with atago <dig> and >87% peptide identity amongst each other; these were thus annotated as naago1a, naago1b and naago1c. similarly, two gene sequences of the naago <dig> share  <dig>  % peptide identity with each other and >74% identity with atago4; these were named naago4a and naago4b. however, we were not able to identify atago <dig> and  <dig> homologs in n. attenuata. further, we mined the sequence data of  <dig> plant species to identify and similarly annotate  <dig> full length agos. these had not been previously annotated as agos . altogether,  <dig> protein sequences were used from  <dig> plant species . additionally,  <dig> ago sequences from tribolium castaneum,  <dig> ago sequences  from insects and early branching animals , and one each of hsago <dig>  and kpago   were used as the out-group in this analysis.

phylogenetic classification and evolutionary expansion of plant agos
during evolution, ago genes have formed an expanding family across different lineages  <cit> . to determine the evolutionary relatedness of plant agos, we reconstructed their phylogeny to evaluate their evolutionary patterns . in order to increase the confidence in the root we included  <dig> non-plant ago sequences in the phylogenetic analysis. plant ago family proved monophyletic and the phylogenetic tree continued to consist of four major classes/clades . both the neighbor joining  and the maximum likelihood  approaches were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of plant agos and both produced similar tree topologies and phylogenetic distributions into four classes/clades . homologs of ago <dig> and ago <dig> were clustered together ; similarly homologs of agos  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> formed a clade . likewise, homologs of agos  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> formed the largest cluster , whereas ago <dig> homologs formed an independent group .figure  <dig> 
neighbor joining  based phylogenetic analysis of agos. mega  <dig>  was used to run the nj analyses.  <dig> non-plant agos were used to determine the root. clade robustness was assessed with  <dig> bootstrap replicates.



from the analysis of ago gene expansion and loss , it was observed that agos might have undergone between 133- <dig> duplication and 272- <dig> loss events . we altered the alignment and alignment processing parameters to test the robustness of our analysis. when l-insi in mafft and ‘automated i’ in trimal were used,  <dig> duplication and  <dig> loss events were obtained; when the parameters were changed to l-insi  and user defined parameters in trimal ,  <dig> duplication and  <dig> loss events were recorded. similarly, when auto options were used for both mafft and trimal,  <dig> and  <dig> duplication and loss events were recorded respectively, whereas  <dig> duplication and  <dig> loss events were recorded when ‘auto’ option in mafft and user-defined parameters for trimal were used. the reconciliation of species tree and ago gene family tree  revealed that the ago ancestor underwent at least five major duplication events early in its evolution, after the divergence of unicellular green algae, such as, chlamydomonas and volvox, but before the divergence of the bryophytes. this probably gave rise to four distinct phylogenetic clades of agos .figure  <dig> 
expansion of agos during plant evolution. ago gene family tree was reconciled with the completely sequenced species tree to identify gain and loss events in each lineage during evolution. the proportions of gains  versus losses events  for ago genes are shown on each of the branches. lower panel indicates the tentative time of appearance of different members of the ago family in plants.



the ago <dig> clade may have diverged before the divergence of higher plants, but after the evolution of multicellularity, suggesting a physiological role, possibly different from the ones regulating developmental processes . reconciliation of ago gft with the species tree showed that an ancestral ago may have undergone > <dig> rounds of duplications by the time of the dicot-monocot divergence. . thus, diversification and duplication of agos could have coincided with the evolution of multicellularity, suggesting the relevance of agos and their associated smrna pathways for developmental and adaptive programs.

the nodes of divergence between dicots and monocots apparent in all four ago phylogenetic classes  indicate that duplications were followed by speciation events . for example, the relatively large number of ago genes  in the poaceae lineage, such as the  <dig> in o. sativa and the  <dig> in brachypodium distachyon were noted . these duplication events may have occurred in parallel with events leading to the loss of ago family members during the evolution of rosids and lamiids . few such losses appeared to have occurred in the brassicaceae and solanaceae, for example, in which 10- <dig> members are found in a. thaliana and  <dig> agos in n. attenuata respectively . in n. attenuata, homologs of atago <dig> and atago <dig> might have been lost while ago <dig> and ago <dig> were duplicated . duplicated copies of ago <dig> are found in other solanaceae taxa as well, such as in n. benthamiana  <cit>  and solanum lycopersicum .

the molecular clock test was performed to gain further insight into the relative timing of duplication and divergence events . this analysis indicates that ancestral ago gene may have required around  <dig> million years to duplicate four times after divergence from the unicellular green algae . clade iv may have been the first to diverge, followed by clade iii, clade ii and clade i, respectively. it may have taken  <dig>  million years for clade i to evolve that now includes ago <dig> and ago <dig> homologs, while clade iv may have required around  <dig>  million years to evolve to include ago <dig>  ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig> homologs; ago <dig> and ago <dig> as its more recent descendants. clade iii most likely evolved around  <dig>  million years and sub-diverged into two clusters, one comprising ago <dig> and the other ago <dig> and ago <dig> 

the phylogenetic tree  reveals that ago <dig> and ago <dig> have orthologs in selaginella and physcomitrella. interestingly, we found that of the  <dig> agos in physcomitrella, the  <dig> previously unannotated ago-like genes form a separate cluster . these agos may have diverged from the clade iv lineage at a time comparable to the duplication of the ancestral ago , and thus may be orthologs of class iv agos. furthermore, homologs in unicellular forms, such as chlamydomonas and volvox, may have evolved independently from the multicellular lineages . we observed that chlamydomonas and volvox agos harbor rudimentary forms of the paz domain but do not contain a distinct mid domain . these results indicate that agos of higher plants are intricate and have substantially diverged from the lower, unicellular forms, potentially to facilitate the complex functions known to be regulated by smrna pathways.

variability in signature residues of plant agos
phylogenetic analysis indicates the presence of four clades/classes of agos and that these have been evolving differently. in addition, in plants, different agos are known to interact with different types of smrnas , wherein each residue of the 7nt region of smrna, ‘the seed region’, sits in a narrow groove to interact with different residues of the mid-piwi lobe of ago proteins  <cit> . it is hypothesized that the sorting of different species of smrnas to various agos  <cit>  may depend on the conservation of these residues across various agos. such functionally important residues may also be regarded as signatures of specific domains. therefore, we attempted to define class-wise signature residues for each of the four classes as well as to re-examine the overarching architecture of ago sequences in plant genomes. the n-terminal domain of agos is the most variable domain, whereas, 'r/k-f-y', 'y-n-k-k', 'd-e-d-h/d' have been regarded as the signatures of paz, mid and piwi domains, respectively  <cit> . upon examining the msa of all the plant agos, we found  <dig> positions  with highly conserved residues . in parallel, we also examined the msa of plant agos in each of the four classes independently to determine class-wise signature residues . we identified  <dig> sites in the paz domains,  <dig> sites in the mid domains and  <dig> sites in the piwi domains that show conservation in the four classes agos. in the mid domain, residues ‘k’, ‘q’ and ‘c’ , thought to directly bind to the 5’-phosphate of smrnas  <cit> , are conserved in all four classes . similarly, ‘k and ‘s’  of piwi domain are conserved in all the four classes .figure  <dig> 
relative residue bias  and relative evolution rate  at functionally important positions in the three domains of agos in the plant kingdom. relative frequency of each residue is represented by the height of the corresponding symbol. height of the bar indicates the relative rate value for respective position. the positions marked with stars  are the previously known signature residues.



results of the msa indicated that residue ‘r’, the popularly regarded signature of the paz domain , are only conserved in class i agos . ‘r’ has been largely replaced by ‘k’  in ago of class ii  and iv , whereas the consensus residue could not be determined for this position  in the paz domain of class iii agos . further, ‘h’ at the alignment position  <dig>  in the paz domain, thought to be important in the recognition of the 3’ ends of smrnas  <cit> , is conserved only in classes i-iii; conserved residues were not found at this position in the paz domain of class iv genes .

another residue relevant to the interaction of ago with the 5’-phosphate of the smrna in the ‘nucleotide specificity loop’ of the mid domain is 't526' , which corresponds to alignment position  <dig> in plants . classes i and iv genes harbor a conserved ‘n’ and ‘k’ respectively, whereas there is no consensus in classes ii and iii at this position. studies of hsago <dig>  <cit>  suggest that the first oxygen atom of the 5'-phosphate of smrnas also interacts with side-chain residue of ‘r812’ in the piwi domain. position  <dig> corresponds to ‘r812’, and harbors a conserved ‘r’ in classes i-iii genes, while in the class iv genes, piwi has a conserved ‘q’ instead . in the crystal structure of hsago <dig> in a complex with mir-20a, the 2nd nucleotide of smrna interacts with ‘q548’ of the mid domain and ‘q757’ of the piwi domain  <cit> . these residues correspond to positions  <dig> and  <dig> in msa. an ‘l’ is present at position  <dig> in classes i and iii, whereas classes ii and iv are highly variable, with ‘q’ and ‘a’ being over-represented in these two classes respectively . the 5th nucleotide interacts with 's798' and 'y804' from the piwi domain in hsago <dig>  <cit> . the first corresponding sites in plant agos contain 's'  in all four classes, the second site harbors 'y'  in class i-iii whereas 'c' is the over-represented residue in class iv.

the ‘d-e-d-h/d’ signature has been associated with the catalytic activity of the piwi domain  <cit> . the ‘d-e-d-h’ signature is apparent in classes i, ii, iv  of plant agos, whereas the d-e-d-d signature is present in ago <dig> and ago <dig> . in general, most of the functionally important sites of class-i agos are conserved, while the converse seems true for class-iii agos .

since the phylogenetic analysis indicates that the agos of unicellular forms such as chlamydomonas and volvox are highly divergent and evolved independently of those of the multicellular forms, we further investigated the occurrence of the above-mentioned residue signatures and predicted functionally important sites . we found a high diversity across many important sites . similarly, the three physcomitrella agos also have unique residues compared to agos in other lineages .

such patterns of occurrence of functionally important residues may have consequences for smrna recruitment, their biochemical activities and the roles of agos in diverse physiological processes in both unicellular and multicellular life-forms. indeed, our homology modeling and rna docking studies clearly pointed towards differences in seed recognition and catalytic region of the four classes of agos .

evolution of ago sequences
we next determined the 'position-by-position' ml-based relative evolutionary rates using a gamma -distribution based best substitution model. of the total  <dig> sites in ‘ago dataset ii’ ,  <dig> sites have a relative rate < <dig> whereas  <dig> sites have relative rates > <dig> in all four classes . relatively small ml values of γ- shape parameter were observed for class i , indicating that the majority of sites  in class i agos  are evolving at slow relative rates. these sites are more frequently found in the mid and piwi domains . on the other hand, class iii agos show a large ml value of the γ- shape parameter , indicating that less number of sites  are evolving at slow relative rates .figure  <dig>

residues involved in substrate recognition and catalysis show low relative rates of evolution , indicating such residues are conserved during the course of evolution. for instance, the ‘d-e-d-d/h’ signature involved in catalytic activity of the piwi domain has low relative rates across all the four classes of agos. overall, the seed recognizing mid-piwi lobe of classes i and ii show a low relative rate . moreover, other regions putatively involved in seed recognition and the nucleotide specificity loop show a low relative evolutionary rate in class i agos as compared to other classes . for certain sites, substitution of residues along with variability in relative rates was noticed between different classes. for instance, at position  <dig>  located near the seed recognition pocket and implicated in the 3' overhang recognition of smrna  <cit> , substitution of k in class i to e in class iv was observed; both the residues are evolving at slow rates . such changes may explain the capacity of ago proteins to sort and load smrnas with specific residues at their termini  <cit> . on the other hand, it was interesting to note that the n-terminal and the paz domains have several sites with high relative rates  across all four classes of agos .

these observations suggested the possibility that different classes of agos undergo site-specific rate shifts. we performed the likelihood ratio test by calculating the coefficient of type i  divergence and the posterior probability  of a shift in substitution rate . rejection of the null hypothesis  indicates that after duplication, selection constraints may have altered many sites differently in different classes . hence, as expected, large variations in site-specific profiles of pp among different classes were observed . maximum shifts were observed between classes i and iv . also, the functional branch lengths  of class iv and class iii were nearly two times greater than the branch length of class i and class ii . such results point to different evolutionary histories of different classes of agos that may have resulted in different structural and functional properties; class i agos may have diverged functionally more than class iv agos.

context-dependent coevolution of amino acid residue
the evolution of protein residues is frequently context-dependent in that substitutions at a given site are affected by local structure, residues at the other sites, and related functions. such context-dependent substitutions result in co-evolution of amino-acid residues that have implications for protein structure and function. we uncovered coevolving residues in plant agos by using pearson correlation coefficient  as implemented in caps  <dig>   algorithm  <cit> . only co-evolving sites with r ≥  <dig>  were considered significant . class iii agos accounted for largest number of coevolving residues . strong correlation of r >  <dig>  was observed between the sites coevolving in the paz domain and piwi domain of class iii agos . four classes of agos displayed heterogenous coevolving groups of residues that are of different sizes. in class iii agos, piwi domains displayed the largest number of coevolving residues . in general, the amino acid residue 'r' is the most frequently correlating residue in class i and ii, while residue ‘l’ is found most frequently correlating in classes iii and iv . in class i, 'g' is the second most frequent residue that is significantly correlated mainly to 'g', 'q', ‘r’ and 'h'. in class ii, ‘g’ is again the second most frequent residue that instead significantly correlates to 'v', 's', ‘e’, 'k' and 'r' . in class iii and iv, ‘p’ is the second most frequent residue that significantly correlates frequently to ‘v’, ‘q’ and ‘f’, and to ‘p’, ‘g’ and 'r' respectively .figure  <dig>

correlation patterns in the context of specific residues at a site in the sequence were observed. for instance, position  <dig>  in the paz domain , is overrepresented by the residues ‘r’ in classes i and iii, and ‘k’ in classes ii and iv agos respectively . this 'k' is highly correlated with two other residues in classes ii and iv . on the other hand, position  <dig> in classes i and iii do not show any significant correlation coefficient with other residues in the protein. similarly, the ‘h’ at position  <dig>  in the mid domain of class i ago is highly correlated to residue ‘q’ at position  <dig> in piwi domain . residue corresponding to position  <dig>  could bind to phosphate of 2nd nucleotide of smrna, directing the 1st nucleotide into a deep binding pocket at the interface between mid and piwi domain, whereas q, corresponding to postion  <dig> may coordinate with n <dig> and n <dig> on the minor groove side of the g <dig> base at seed sequence of smrna  <cit>  . in other classes, where ‘h’ is replaced, no significant correlation is observed. in hsago, ‘r’ corresponding to  <dig> in the piwi domain  stacks between the u <dig> and u <dig> of mirnas to result in a major kink  <cit> . in classes i, ii and iii residues ‘r’ is conserved at position  <dig>  and do not show any correlation with other residues, whereas in class iv agos, this position is overrepresented by ‘n’ and shows significant correlation to two other residues .

diverse correlation patterns were observed in the ‘nucleotide specificity loop’ across the four classes of agos . none of the five residues of nucleotide specificity loop of class i ago showed any significant correlation. the 5’-end of the smrnas interact with peptide backbone of the hsago residues  <cit>  corresponding to positions  <dig> and  <dig> . ‘t’, as in hsago, was overrepresented only in class ii  and correlated to residues in piwi and paz domains . on the other hand, in class iv, ‘e’  correlates with ‘r’ in mid domain and ‘v’, ‘s’ and ‘h’ in piwi domain . such class specific coevolving residues may influence the functional diversification of agos.

discussion
several differences in smrna processing and mode of action have been noted between plants and animals  <cit> . in addition, no significant homologies have been found in mirnas of plants and animals, plants and green algae, or between animals and sponges  <cit> . this indicates that the smrna pathways may have evolved independently in the different lineages of life. ago proteins form the core of the smrna-mediated regulatory mechanisms and thus are bonafide candidates for studying the evolution of smrna pathways. here we have reconstructed a comprehensive phylogeny of plant ago proteins and examined their evolution. based on this analysis of  <dig> ago genes from  <dig> species, plant agos can be divided into four phylogenetic clades/classes. these results suggest that early speciation events separated the agos in unicellular and multicellular organisms, wherein agos expanded independently to evolve complex domain structures. an ancestral ago gene may have undergone approximately five duplication events during the time of divergence of green algae and mosses. the ago family may have further expanded with the emergence of monocot and dicot lineages in plants. later speciation events may have resulted in species-specific gains or losses of some members.

the smrna-mediated interaction is biochemically based on the principle of recognition and loading of smrnas onto the agos to form an rna-protein complex. this complex targets complementary mrnas and regulates protein synthesis. diverse pools of smrnas occur in plant cells that exploit this elegant principle of rna recognition and cleavage to fine-tune gene expression. plants produce a large diversity of smrnas ; dna methylation/chromatin modifications require the association of  <dig> nt smrnas onto class iv proteins , whereas  <dig> nt mirnas recruited onto ago <dig> results in mrna cleavage in plants  <cit> . the organization of the signatures in rna-recognition and catalytic domains  of agos play a crucial role in recognizing various forms of smrnas . such variations in rna-interacting domains of agos  may influence substrate recruitment as well as its biochemical fate  of the smrna-target interaction  <cit> .

here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of plant agos: we have not only annotated  <dig> agos in  <dig> plant species , we have also cloned  <dig> ago genes from the wild tobacco plant, n. attenuata , a well-studied model system for plant-insect interactions and adaptive plasticity. we have shown earlier that n. attenuata harbors at least three functional rdrs  <cit>  and four dcls  <cit> ; information on ago protein in n. attenuata had been totally missing. a detailed investigation on the elucidation of function of these  <dig> naagos could reveal the effector molecules of a unique herbivory-elicited smrna pathway.

it is evident that many of the functionally important residues are coevolving between the four groups of agos. for instance, the residue ‘p’  is conserved in classes i, ii and iv, and correlates with residues r in classes i, ii, and iii . similarly, position  <dig> correlates with only a single polar residue in classes i, iii and iv whereas in class ii, this position correlates with seven residues that may be polar or nonpolar, indicating that the selection pressure is higher at this site in class ii  as compared to other classes . coevolution patterns may form the basis of specialization of agos for differential sorting of smrnas  <cit> ; the 5’end of the incoming smrna interacts with the peptide backbone of the agos. the conformational variability of the residues in the nucleotide specificity loop  would make the agos selective for specific smrnas and thus helping them sort different 5’ nucleotides of an incoming rna  <cit> .

such specific variations in residues may lead to the functional specialization of ago proteins. indeed, specificity in the physiological functions of agos has been noticed in arabidopsis. for instance, ago <dig> has been implicated in anti-bacterial defense, whereas ago <dig> is implicated in anti-viral response mechanisms  <cit> . it is noteworthy that although multi-member ago families have been predicted computationally in several plants, many agos in plants  have not been experimentally confirmed; information on their physiological roles is thus meager. here we have experimentally determined the full length sequences of  <dig> n. attenuata agos. extensive 'loss-of-function' analyses of these  <dig> naagos is planned for future investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
the evolution of ago proteins highly coincides with the evolution of multicellular forms of plants, indicating that smrnas may have played crucial roles in their development and adaptation. such an evolutionary pattern of duplication of agos also coincides with the evolution of other components of smrna pathway as recently reported for animal and plant dicers  <cit> . our analysis is consistent with the conclusion that the ago-mediated recognition of rna and its regulation is a highly dynamic phenomenon across evolutionary time scales.
