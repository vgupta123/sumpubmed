BACKGROUND
formation of branched tubes from an initially unbranched epithelial bud is a fundamental morphogenetic process in the development of many organs, including pancreas, mammary gland, lung, and kidney  <cit> . although the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tubulogenesis are still incompletely understood, a number of polypeptide growth factors have been shown to stimulate the formation and branching of epithelial tubes  <cit> . the most thoroughly characterized of these tubulogenic cytokines are hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor   <cit> , glial cell-derived neurotropic factor  <cit> , and several members of the fibroblast growth factor family  <cit> .

elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for epithelial tubulogenesis is made difficult by the multiplicity and complexity of cell interactions occurring in vivo. to overcome this drawback, several groups including our own have designed three-dimensional cell culture systems that accurately recapitulate key events of tubulogenesis, thereby facilitating its molecular analysis  <cit> . the recent development of an experimental model in which eph4-j3b1a mammary epithelial cells form spheroidal cysts when grown in collagen gels in chemically defined medium  <cit>  has provided an additional tractable assay for deciphering the constellation of signals that govern branching tubulogenesis.

transforming growth factor-β  is the prototypic member of a superfamily of structurally related cytokines involved in the regulation of a broad spectrum of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, production of extracellular matrix, and tissue repair. three tgf-β isoforms  have been described in mammals. tgf-βs are secreted as inactive complexes, in which the c-terminal mature homodimer is non-covalently bound to a dimer of its n-terminal precursor polypeptide, also known as latency associated peptide . the lap, in turn, is disulfide-bonded to an unrelated protein, which is referred to as latent tgf-β binding protein . tgf-β activation, i.e. the release of tgf-β from lap, may be mediated by different mechanisms and represents a critical step in the regulation of tgf-β bioactivity  <cit> . tgf-βs achieve their pleiotropic activities through the activation of heteromeric complexes of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors designated as tgf-β type i  and type ii  receptors. ligand binding to tβrii induces the recruitment and transphosphorylation of tβri. activated tβri phosphorylates receptor-associated smads , which then bind smad <dig> and translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription of target genes. in addition to smads, other signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases , can also be activated by tgf-βs  <cit> .

herein, we report that low concentrations  of tgf-β <dig> rapidly induce tube formation in cultured mammary epithelial cells, and that this biological response requires mmp activity.

RESULTS
a heat- and acid-resistant factor in bovine serum stimulates branching tubulogenesis of eph4-j3b1a mammary epithelial cells
this study was prompted by the finding that addition of fcs to serum-free collagen gel cultures of j3b1a cells  <cit> , a clonal derivative of the murine eph <dig> mammary epithelial cell line  <cit> , stimulates the formation of branching tubes. when grown in collagen gels in chemically-defined medium supplemented with all-trans-retinoic acid, j3b1a cells formed spheroidal cysts enclosing a patent lumen  <cit> . addition of 10% fcs to preformed cysts induced the radial outgrowth of tube-like structures from the cyst wall. fcs-induced tube formation was more pronounced in gels that had been released and allowed to float in the medium , possibly owing to the greater compliance of unrestrained collagen matrices  <cit> . floating gels were therefore used for the remainder of this study.

the ability of fcs to stimulate formation of branching tubes in collagen gel cultures of j3b1a cells suggested the existence of a putative tubulogenic factor  in serum. preliminary experiments aimed at characterizing the physico-chemical properties of the serum factor showed that the tubulogenesis-inducing activity of fcs was not only resistant to heat, but was in fact enhanced by heating . the tubulogenic activity was also markedly increased by transient acidification of fcs to ph  <dig>  thus, addition of as little as 1% acidified fcs to j3b1a cells grown in collagen gels in defined medium elicited a vigorous tubulogenic response within only 24– <dig> hours .

the tubulogenic component in fcs is tgf-β1
based on the foregoing findings, we considered the possibility that the tubulogenic factor was tgf-β, a cytokine that is present in serum in latent form and can be activated by heat or acid treatment  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we first assessed whether pre-treatment with sb- <dig>  a selective inhibitor of the tgf-β type i receptor  <cit> , would prevent the tubulogenic effect of acidified fcs. we found that branching tubulogenesis was suppressed by sb- <dig> in a dose-dependent manner . to further validate the hypothesis that the tubulogenic agent in fcs is tgf-β, and to determine the potential tgf-β isoform responsible for induction of branching tubulogenesis, acid-treated fcs was pre-incubated with isoform-specific neutralizing antibody to either tgf-β <dig> or tgf-β <dig> before being added to j3b1a cells in collagen gels. anti-tgf-β <dig> antibodies abrogated the tubulogenic effect of acidified fcs in a dose-dependent manner, a significant inhibition  being observed with concentrations of antibody as low as  <dig> ng/ml . in contrast, neither a function-blocking anti-tgf-β <dig> antibody , nor a control antibody that does not react with tgf-βs  inhibited the tubulogenic activity of acidified fcs. these results clearly identified tgf-β <dig> as the tubulogenic agent present in fcs.

low concentrations of exogenous tgf-β <dig> recapitulate the tubulogenic effect of acidified fcs
we next asked whether exogenous tgf-β <dig> could be able to recapitulate the tubulogenic activity of acid-treated fcs. as tgf-β <dig> is known to elicit different cellular responses in the same cell type depending on its concentration, we examined the effects of a wide range of concentrations of tgf-β <dig>  addition of low concentration  of recombinant tgf-β <dig> stimulated the rapid formation of branching tubular outgrowths from the wall of the original cysts . at higher magnification, the outgrowths were seen to enclose a patent lumen, which was often continuous with the cyst cavity . examination of semi-thin sections confirmed the tubular nature of tgf-β1-induced centrifugal outgrowths . the tubulogenic effect of tgf-β <dig> was already evident after  <dig> hours and increased progressively during the next 2– <dig> days of treatment. at slightly higher concentrations , tgf-β <dig> induced the extension of pointed outgrowths devoid of a visible lumen . finally, incubation with tgf-β <dig> at concentrations greater than  <dig> pg/ml resulted in the conversion of existing cysts into disorganized, lumen-less cellular aggregates, from which numerous thin cellular cords extended radially into the surrounding matrix . similar effects were observed following addition of recombinant tgf-β <dig> or tgf-β <dig> . these results indicated that when added to collagen gel cultures of j3b1a cells in the concentration range of 20– <dig> pg/ml, exogenous tgf-βs induce the morphogenesis of hollow tubular structures that are reminiscent of mammary gland ducts. based on the foregoing findings, subsequent experiments were designed to characterize in more detail the tubulogenic activity of low concentrations of tgf-β <dig>  a quantitative analysis demonstrated that tgf-β <dig> elicits the formation of tubular outgrowths in a dose- and time-dependent manner, a significant  effect being observed after  <dig> hours of treatment with tgf-β <dig> concentrations as low as  <dig> pg/ml .

to determine whether tgf-β1-induced tubulogenesis was dependent on cell interaction with collagen fibrils or could also occur in other types of three-dimensional matrices, we next examined the tgf-β <dig> response of j3b1a cells suspended in fibrin gels. when grown in fibrin gels in defined medium, j3b1a cells formed spherical cysts . in striking contrast, in the presence of 20– <dig> pg/ml tgf-β <dig>  the cells formed branched tubules . addition of tgf-β <dig> at concentrations greater than  <dig> pg/ml induced the development of complex, highly arborized networks of branching and anastomosing cell cords , which were however devoid of a visible lumen, similarly to what we had observed in collagen gels .

a quantitative analysis demonstrated that tgf-β <dig> elicits tube formation in fibrin gels in a dose- and time-dependent manner, a highly significant  effect being observed after  <dig> hours of treatment with tgf-β <dig> concentrations as low as  <dig> pg/ml . finally, we assessed the effect of tgf-β <dig> on j3b1a cells grown in matrigel, a laminin-rich extracellular matrix  <cit> . contrary to what we observed in collagen or fibrin gels, both control and tgf-β1-treated cells formed spheroidal colonies in matrigel. the lack of tube formation in this experimental setting is unlikely due to an inhibitory effect of a matrigel component, because j3b1a cells exhibited a robust tubulogenic response to tgf-β <dig>  when grown in a 1: <dig> mixture of matrigel and type i collagen . we speculate that cells suspended in pure matrigel, which is a highly compliant non-fibrillar substratum  <cit> , are unable to generate the traction forces required for centrifugal outgrowth into the surrounding matrix.

inhibitors of p <dig> mapks abrogate tgf-β1-induced tubulogenesis
in addition to the smad-mediated signaling pathway, mounting evidence indicates that tgf-β also activates several mitogen-activated protein kinases , including extracellular signal-regulated kinases , c-jun n-terminal kinases  and p <dig> kinases  <cit> . to begin assessing the contribution of mapks to tgf-β-induced branching tubulogenesis, we used several small-molecule inhibitors that selectively block the erk, jnk, or p <dig> pathways. pretreatment of collagen gel cultures with u <dig>  a selective inhibitor of the erk activators mek <dig> and mek <dig>  <cit> , attenuated tgf-β1-induced branching tubulogenesis in a dose-dependent manner, a 63% inhibition being observed at  <dig> μm . likewise, addition of sp <dig>  a jnk inhibitor  <cit> , resulted in 65% inhibition of tubulogenesis at  <dig> μm . remarkably, the p <dig> inhibitor pd <dig>  <cit>  was comparatively much more effective in suppressing tgf-β1-induced tubule formation, with an 88% inhibition being observed with a concentration as low as  <dig> μm and a virtually total inhibition at  <dig> μm . these findings suggest that mapk  signaling is required for tgf-β1-induced tubulogenesis. validation of this hypothesis will await additional studies involving knockdown of mapks by sirna technology.

tgf-β1-induced branching tubulogenesis requires mmp activity
formation of epithelial tubes in collagen gels has previously been shown to require the activity of matrix metalloproteinases   <cit> . to assess the potential role of mmps in tgf-β1-induced tubulogenesis, we examined the effect of tgf-β <dig> on the production of mmps implicated in extracellular matrix  degradation, including membrane-type-1-mmp ,  <dig> kda gelatinase ,  <dig> kda gelatinase , and collagenase- <dig>   <cit> . by northern blot, mt1-mmp  mrna was constitutively expressed by j3b1a cells but not ostensibly modulated by tgf-β <dig>  whereas mmp- <dig> mrna was not detected. in contrast, the levels of mmp- <dig> mrna were increased by tgf-β <dig> in a dose-dependent manner . western blot analysis confirmed both the lack of modulation of mt1-mmp  and the dose-dependent induction of mmp- <dig> . western blots also showed that mmp- <dig> is constitutively expressed by j3b1a cells, and that this expression is not ostensibly modulated by tgf-β <dig> . by zymographic analysis  <cit> , conditioned media from untreated j3b1a cells produced a band of gelatin lysis corresponding to the reported molecular weight  of the latent form of mouse mmp- <dig>  treatment with tgf-β <dig> resulted in a marked dose-dependent increase in this activity. in contrast, consistent with the lack of detection of mmp- <dig> mrna, no proteolytic activity corresponding to the molecular weight of mmp- <dig> was detected in control or tgf-β1-treated cells .

to determine whether mmp activity is required for tgf-β1-induced tubulogenesis, we first assessed the effect of tgf-β <dig>  in the presence of the hydroxamate-based metalloproteinase inhibitor bb <dig>  <cit> . formation of branching tubules was abrogated in a dose-dependent manner by bb <dig>  but not by the related inactive isomer bb <dig> . since hydroxamate-based inhibitors also inactivate members of the adamalysin family of metalloproteinases  <cit> , we next used recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- <dig> , which more selectively suppresses the activity of mmps  <cit> . timp- <dig>  inhibited tgf-β1-induced tubulogenesis  by  <dig> % , thereby confirming the involvement of the mmp family of metalloproteinases. finally, we examined the potential effect of cl- <dig> and mmp- <dig> inhibitor i, two synthetic compounds that selectively target mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . addition of cl- <dig> at concentrations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μm had no obvious inhibitory activity on tgf-β1-induced tubulogenesis , whereas mmp- <dig> inhibitor i suppressed this biological response in a dose-dependent manner . these findings support a role for mmp- <dig> in tgf-β1-induced branching tubulogenesis.

discussion
to identify the molecular cues that orchestrate epithelial tubulogenesis, we took advantage of an in vitro system in which j3b1a mammary epithelial cells grown in collagen gels in chemically defined medium form spherical cysts. addition of acidified fcs to the defined medium induced the formation of branching tubes. using a pharmacological inhibitor of tgf-β receptor signaling and a neutralizing antibody to tgf-β <dig>  we identified the active component in acidified fcs as tgf-β <dig>  importantly, the effect of acidified fcs was accurately recapitulated by exogenous tgf-β <dig> in the concentration range of 20– <dig> pg/ml. these findings demonstrate that, at low concentrations, tgf-β <dig> can activate a morphogenetic program culminating in formation of epithelial tubes.

tgf-β <dig> is a multifunctional cytokine that elicits different and sometimes opposite cellular responses in the same cell type depending on its concentration  <cit> . in accordance with this notion, the effects of tgf-β <dig> in our system were clearly concentration-dependent. thus, in the range of 20– <dig> pg/ml, tgf-β <dig> stimulated the rapid extension of hollow branched tubes from the wall of existing cysts. in contrast, at concentrations higher than  <dig> pg/ml, tgf-β <dig> induced the formation of thin cellular outgrowths, similar to those described in cultures of gallbladder  <cit>  and thyroid  <cit>  epithelial cells.

the results presented here complement those obtained previously using tac- <dig> cells, a different murine mammary epithelial cell line  <cit> . in the latter study, we reported that low concentrations of tgf-β <dig> promote the elongation and branching of epithelial cords. however, the absence of a central lumen within tac- <dig> cell cords supported the interpretation that tgf-β <dig> was sufficient to mediate only a subset of morphogenetic events involved in the formation of duct-like structures  <cit> . using j3b1a mammary epithelial cells grown in chemically defined medium, we provide now evidence that, at concentrations of 20– <dig> pg/ml, tgf-β <dig> is able to induce the formation of hollow tubes that mimic the organization of mammary gland ducts.

several groups have reported that tgf-β <dig>  at relatively high concentrations, stimulates a process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition  characterized by the acquisition of spindle-like cell morphology, reorganization of cortical actin into stress fibers, downregulation and/or relocalization of junctional proteins  and gain of mesenchymal markers  <cit> . this phenotypic conversion has been primarily described in nmumg mammary epithelial cells, but is much less pronounced, or does not occur at all, in other cell lines. thus, in mcf-10a mammary epithelial cells, tgf-β <dig> decreases the insoluble pool of e-cadherin without inducing conversion to a spindle phenotype  <cit> . moreover, in a screening of  <dig> established epithelial cell lines, only two strains were reported to undergo emt in response to tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . of particular relevance to the present study, it has been shown  <cit>  that tgf-β <dig> induces full emt in ras-transformed eph <dig> cells, but not in wild-type eph <dig> cells . in our own studies, the effects of tgf-β <dig> on j3b1a cells grown on a planar substrate  were concentration-dependent. following incubation with relatively high concentrations  of tgfβ <dig> for  <dig> days, j3b1a cells acquired an irregular shape and underwent a moderate degree of scattering. in contrast, when treated with tubulogenic concentrations  of tgf-β <dig>  j3b1a cells formed multicellular colonies that were slightly less compact than in control cultures but nonetheless retained close cell-cell contacts and typical epithelial morphology . likewise, we found that  <dig> ng/ml tgf-β <dig> induces the expression of mesenchymal markers  and slightly decreases the expression of epithelial markers  in j3b1a cells. in contrast,  <dig> pg/ml tgf-β <dig> did not elicit ostensible changes in the epithelial markers examined, while inducing a marginal upregulation of α-sm-actin .

the concentration-dependent effects of tgf-β reported in this study can be interpreted as reflecting graded changes in epithelial plasticity. it is now well established that the epithelial phenotype is highly dynamic and finely modulated by microenvironmental cues. epithelial plasticity encompasses a whole spectrum of changes, ranging from full emt to more subtle alterations that are not associated with overt mesenchymal conversion  <cit> . thus, during biological processes that involve coordinate cell repositioning, such as branching morphogenesis  <cit> , epithelial cells transiently downregulate or relocalize adhesion proteins while remaining connected by intercellular junctions  <cit> . in light of these notions, we propose that low concentrations of tgf-β induce a moderate increase in epithelial plasticity, thereby facilitating the morphogenetic cell rearrangements required for tubulogenesis. in contrast, higher concentrations of tgf-β would trigger more pronounced alterations of the epithelial phenotype, resulting in disturbances of cell polarity and partial emt. this hypothesis is supported by the finding that, in our system, low concentrations of tgf-β <dig> promote the development of well-organized tubular structures, while higher concentrations cause the formation of lumen-less cell cords.

the formation and elongation of tube-like epithelial structures in collagen gels involve a process of invasive growth  <cit> , which is dependent on the activity of mmps, a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that play a key role in ecm degradation  <cit> . as a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms responsible for tgf-β1-induced tubulogenesis, we assessed the effect of tgf-β <dig> on the production of mmps involved in collagen turnover, including mt1-mmp , collagenase- <dig> ,  <dig> kda gelatinase  and  <dig> kda gelatinase   <cit> . mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> were constitutively expressed by j3b1a cells, but were not obviously modulated by tgf-β <dig>  interestingly, however, in accordance with previous studies in keratinocytes  <cit> , corneal epithelial cells  <cit>  and mcf- <dig> mammary epithelial cells  <cit> , tgf-β <dig> markedly enhanced the expression of  <dig> kda gelatinase  at the level of mrna, protein, and enzymatic activity. while gelatinases are unable to cleave intact fibrillar collagen, they nonetheless play an important role in collagen degradation by acting sequentially after the initial cleavage of the triple helix by either mt1-mmp or interstitial collagenases  <cit> . notably, mmp- <dig> is particularly well suited to effect pericellular proteolysis owing to its ability to bind to cell surface molecules  <cit> . to determine whether mmp activity is required for epithelial tube formation, we used the synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor bb <dig> and the physiological mmp inhibitor timp- <dig>  and found that both of them abrogate tgf-β1-induced tubulogenesis. notably, a relatively selective inhibitor of mmp- <dig>   <cit>  significantly attenuated tgf-β1-induced tube formation, but was less efficient in this respect than the broad spectrum inhibitor bb <dig>  these findings suggest that mmp- <dig> participates in tgf-β1-induced tubulogenesis in our system, possibly by acting in concert with other mmps, and strengthen the notion that tube formation in collagen gels is dependent on mmp activity  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms underlying mmp requirement for tgf-β1-induced tube formation are not known. a straightforward possibility is that expression of mmps at the advancing tip of the cellular outgrowths creates a path in the surrounding matrix, thereby facilitating directional tube elongation. however, mmps might also participate in epithelial tubulogenesis by more complex mechanisms, e.g. by exposing cryptic sites in collagen molecules, by releasing proteolytic fragments of matrix proteins that stimulate cell motility, or by processing cell surface ecm receptors  <cit> . overall, our study lends significant support to the notion  <cit>  that the balance of mmp/mmp inhibitors has a key role in branching morphogenesis. it is likely, however, that this morphogenetic process involves additional mechanisms, including deposition of endogenous ecm components and altered expression of integrin or non-integrin matrix receptors. further studies will be required to address these issues.

an important question raised by this study is whether the morphogenetic activity of tgf-β <dig> observed in our in vitro model is relevant to the process of branching tubulogenesis that occurs in vivo. at first sight, the finding that tgf-β <dig> induces tubule formation appears difficult to reconcile with previous in vitro and in vivo studies suggesting a negative regulatory role for tgf-βs in branching morphogenesis. it is noteworthy, however, that while most experimental evidence points to an inhibitory activity of tgf-βs  <cit> , studies in embryonic lung have shown that low concentrations of tgf-β <dig> promote branching morphogenesis, whereas higher concentrations are inhibitory  <cit> . the prevalent notion that tgf-βs are negative modulators of branching morphogenesis is based on three main sets of experimental data. first, delivery of tgf-β <dig> to mouse mammary glands using slow release plastic implants has been shown to inhibit duct elongation  <cit> . it is possible however that relatively high concentrations of tgf-β <dig> were locally released by the implants, resulting in suppression of epithelial growth. in a second experimental approach, addition of exogenous tgf-β to lung bud organ cultures was reported to inhibit branching morphogenesis  <cit> . in those studies, however, high concentrations  of tgf-β were used. in a third approach, perturbation of tgf-β receptor signalling in vitro  <cit>  or in vivo  <cit>  was associated with increased epithelial branching, implying an inhibitory role for tgf-βs in branching morphogenesis. in those experimental settings, however, tgf-β-dependent signal transduction could have been attenuated rather than totally abrogated, thereby unmasking a potential morphogenic activity of low-level tgf-β signalling. therefore, while caution needs to be exercised in extrapolating information gained from our in vitro system to the whole organism, the results reported here underscore the need for re-evaluating the in vivo effects of tgf-β on branching morphogenesis using a wide range of cytokine concentrations.

parenchymal organs contain significant quantities of latent tgf-β stored in the ecm. as a consequence, tgf-β bioavailability is primarily regulated by the conversion of latent tgf-β to its active form. interestingly, it has been shown that tgf-β activation in the mammary gland is controlled by ovarian hormones  <cit> . it is therefore tempting to speculate that spatially and temporally restricted activation of a small fraction of matrix-bound latent tgf-β contributes to the morphogenesis of mammary gland ducts.

in an attempt to reconcile the disparate and apparently paradoxical effects of tgf-β <dig> reported in the literature, we propose that tgf-β <dig> has multiple, context- and concentration-dependent effects on mammary gland epithelial cells. low concentrations of the cytokine may increase epithelial plasticity and promote morphogenetic cell rearrangements that culminate in the development of branching ducts. at higher concentrations, the growth inhibitory activity of tgf-β <dig> is likely to override its ability to enhance epithelial plasticity, resulting in suppression of duct formation. finally, sustained high-level expression of tgf-β <dig> in the setting of a genetically altered epithelium could lead to emt, thereby fostering tumor progression.

CONCLUSIONS
while the precise role of tgf-β <dig> in the regulation of branching morphogenesis in vivo remains to be assessed, our study clearly demonstrates that low concentrations of tgf-β <dig> can profoundly modify the spatial organization of epithelial cells, resulting in the formation of branching tubular structures. owing to the rapidity and robustness of the morphogenetic response induced by tgf-β <dig>  the experimental system we have developed affords a unique opportunity for dissecting the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for epithelial tubulogenesis. this system also provides a convenient bioassay with which to identify additional morphoregulatory molecules.
