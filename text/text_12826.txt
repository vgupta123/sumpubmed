BACKGROUND
tousled-like kinases  belong to a family of serine-threonine kinases highly conserved in plants as well as animals  <cit> . tousled-mutants in arabidopsis have abnormal flower development, with defects also in leaf morphology and flowering time  <cit> . humans have two homologs of tousled: tlk <dig> and tlk <dig>  <cit> . the exact function of these kinases has not been determined, but they are known to act in a cell-cycle dependent manner. they are maximally active during the s phase, and are also the targets of checkpoint kinases  <cit> . specifically, it has been reported that tlk <dig> is inhibited by atm-chk <dig> by direct phosphorylation at ser  <dig>  <cit> . knockout of the tousled gene in drosophila and c. elegans cause an early arrest in embryonic development  <cit> , while expression of a dominant negative mutant in mouse cells causes loss of nuclear divisions and missegregation of chromosomes  <cit> . the importance of tlk <dig> in chromosome segregation was also confirmed by a study on c. elegans embryos  <cit> . we recently cloned a cdna encoding a mammalian tousled-like kinase, through a different scheme, based on the polysomal redistribution of weakly translated transcripts that become preferentially recruited upon overexpression of the translation initiation factor eif4e  <cit> . this mrna is a splice-variant of tlk <dig> mrna, and encodes a  <dig> kda protein  as compared to the  <dig> kda tlk <dig> protein. tlk1b is translationally regulated by its 5'utr and both ionizing radiation  and the radiomimetic drug doxorubicin cause an increase in its translation  <cit> . unlike tlk <dig> and tlk <dig> that are widely expressed in various organs and tissues, tlk1b is expressed at very low levels in normal cells, but is overexpressed in some breast carcinomas  <cit> .

tlk <dig> has only two known substrates. one is the histone h <dig>  and it is phosphorylated at serine  <dig>  <cit> . the other substrate is the histone chaperone asf <dig>  <cit> , which, in addition to its role in nucleosome assembly  <cit>  and disassembly  <cit> , has been shown to have multiple functions. most importantly, asf <dig> has been implicated in dna repair  <cit> . human asf <dig> and caf- <dig>  have been shown to interact and synergize in a repair-coupled nucleosome assembly pathway  <cit> . the role of asf <dig> in dna repair has been further confirmed by genetic studies in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . in addition, asf <dig> is also associated with checkpoint effectors  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, it interacts with the unphosphorylated form of the checkpoint kinase rad <dig> . upon dna damage and replication block, rad <dig> is phosphorylated and dissociates from this complex, leaving asf <dig> free to interact with acetylated histones h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> . despite the association of asf <dig> and rad <dig> in yeast, an asf1-chk <dig> interaction in mammalian cells has not yet been reported. thus the mechanism of asf <dig> regulation might be different, and could be dependent on its phosphorylation status. however, the consequence of asf <dig> phosphorylation in mammalian cells remains unknown.

tlk1b overexpression protects mouse mammary cells  from the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation   <cit> . . based on this evidence and the fact that atm and chk <dig> are involved in the dna damage checkpoint, it can be hypothesized that tlks are involved in some aspect of genome surveillance, particularly chromatin remodeling concurrent with dna repair. accordingly, we showed that tlk1b protected cells from ir by facilitating the repair of double-stranded breaks   <cit> . using an in vitro repair system, we showed that addition of recombinant tlk1b promoted the repair of a linearized plasmid incubated with nuclear extracts, possibly by influencing the assembly of chromatin on the dna template  <cit> .

in this paper we provide evidence that overexpression of tlk1b also protects cells from the harmful effects of uv-radiation. it is well known that uv-radiation is a potent and ubiquitous carcinogen responsible for the majority of skin cancers  <cit> . unlike ir which primarily causes dsbs, uv-induced dna damage mainly results in the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers   <cit> . in humans, cpds are repaired by a process known as nucleotide-excision repair   <cit> . one of the best studied pathways in dna repair, ner is highly conserved in eukaryotes. there are many differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes; however, the basic principles are retained. ner is subdivided into two pathways; global genomic repair  that targets and removes lesions from the whole genome, and transcription-coupled repair  that preferentially removes lesions from the transcribed strand of expressed genes. it consists of four main steps: 1) recognition of the damage; 2) dual excision and removal of the intervening damaged dna strand; 3) gap repair synthesis; and 4) ligation of the nick. in mammalian cells, ner is a complex process involving multiple large protein complexes. packaging of the eukaryotic dna into chromatin further complicates the process because in principle, damage accessibility would be dependent on the structural properties of the nucleosomes in and around the site of dna damage  <cit> . ner is not essential for viability, but defects in the process result in disorders. one example is the genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum , which is associated with severe light sensitivity and an increased risk of uv-induced skin cancers. these diseases exemplify the importance of uv-induced dna damage and its repair in humans  <cit> .

based on clonogenic assays, we first show that tlk1b-overexpressing cells are more resistant to uv radiation. this is further confirmed by an in vivo assay showing efficient and faster repair of genomic dna as well as episomes in intact cells exposed to uv-radiation. finally we use in vitro assays that demonstrate that tlk1b-overexpressing cells promote chromatin remodeling as well as repair of dna damage, likely by modulating the activity of asf <dig> 

RESULTS
tlk1b protects the cells from uv
we have previously shown that stable overexpression of tlk1b protects a normal cell line  from ir  <cit> . therefore, we investigated if tlk1b could protect these cells from other types of dna damage, or if it was specific for dsbs. studies of its role in other types of dna damage would help us to get a clearer picture of the position of this kinase in the dna damage response pathway. we tested the effect of uv, which induces formation of pyrimidine dimers, on control cells , cells overexpressing tlk1b  and cells expressing the kinase dead mutant of tlk1b  by a clonogenic assay . for making the kinase-dead mutant expressing cells the highly conserved d <dig> and k <dig> residues in the atp-binding pocket of the kinase were replaced with alanine. in vitro, the mutant kinase, expressed as a gst-fusion in bacteria, lost the capacity to phosphorylate itself and histone h <dig>  <cit> . the kinase-dead  protein was then expressed from the bk-shuttle vector as done before for the wt tlk1b. mm3-kd cells may be expected to show increased sensitivity to uv damage, if the kd mutant acts as a dominant negative for tlk <dig> and tlk <dig> substrates. the bk-shuttle vector replicates as an episome with a very consistent copy number in each cell and hence, the transfected population gives homogeneous expression of the transgene, making it unnecessary to select individual g418-resistant clones  <cit> . this is an important point since the results obtained thereafter cannot be simply attributed to the selection of an aberrant clone.

we found that 21% of the mm3mg cells survive at  <dig> j/m <dig>  10% of the mm3-kd cells survive, while 63% of the mm3-tlk1b cells survive at the same dose. for the dose of  <dig> j/m <dig> also, the survival fraction is considerably higher in mm3-tlk1b cells as compared to mm3mg and mm3-kd cells ; . this indicates that overexpression of tlk1b significantly increases the resistance to uv radiation.

in vivo repair of uv damage in mm3mg and mm3-tlk1b cells
we next wanted to determine the basis behind the increased survival of mm3-tlk1b cells after exposure to uv. expression of tlk1b did not appreciably alter the transcriptome in mm3mg cell lines , indicating that the protective effect was likely post-transcriptional. we recently showed that tlk1b promotes the repair of double-stranded breaks , most likely by promoting chromatin remodeling at the sites of damage  <cit> . therefore we hypothesized that a similar mechanism of more efficient dna repair might be responsible for the increased survival of mm3-tlk1b cells after exposure to uv radiation. in order to investigate this, the repair of genomic dna in mm3mg and mm3-tlk1b cells was determined using an immunoblot assay and monoclonal antibodies specific to cpds, over a time course. as shown in figures 2a and 2b, the mm3-tlk1b cells efficiently repaired almost all the cpds by  <dig> hours. on the other hand, mm3mg cells show very poor levels of cpd removal.

another method was used to compare the repair abilities of the two cell lines. for this purpose, we assessed the repair of episomal vectors in cells over a time course following exposure to uv. mm3mg cells  and the mm3-tlk1b cells were exposed to  <dig> j/m <dig> of uv radiation, and allowed to recover for  <dig> to <dig> hours . episomes were extracted at various time points  and were either mock-treated or digested with t <dig> endonuclease v enzyme, which specifically cuts dna at cpd-sites. since the episomes are damaged on both strands at multiple sites, digestion with t <dig> endonuclease results in extensive cleavage of the plasmid dna, whereas in unirradiated cells t <dig> endonuclease leaves the plasmids intact . figure  <dig> shows the repair ability of mm3mg and mm3-tlk1b cell lines by this method. on inspection of the two gels it was seen that the majority of low molecular weight episomal dna was recovered into repaired high molecular weight dna in the mm3-tlk1b cells between  <dig> and  <dig> hours, while the t <dig> endonuclease treated episomal dna still appeared as a low molecular weight smear in the mm3mg cells. these two experiments strongly suggest that the mm3-tlk1b cells repaired dna faster than the control mm3mg cells.

the phosphorylation of h <dig> recovers faster in tlk1b-expressing cells
genotoxins cause a temporary, atm-dependent, inactivation of tlk <dig>  <cit>  that can best be monitored through a loss of phosphorylation of histone h3-s <dig>  <cit> . we set out to test whether uv would also be a treatment that caused dephosphorylation followed by re-phosphorylation of h <dig> when the cells are allowed to recover post treatment. indeed, there was a dramatic loss of h3p-s <dig> following uv damage, which persisted for  <dig> hours in the mm3mg cells, but only for  <dig> hours in the cells expressing tlk1b . therefore, if the phosphorylation of h <dig> can be taken as an indication of repair activity in uv-damaged cells, then there is a much faster recovery/repair in cells expressing tlk1b. the phosphorylation of h <dig> was taken as an indicator of tlk <dig> activity/inactivation, since no change in mobility was observed for the other substrate of tlk <dig>  asf <dig>  following uv. we should stress that the change in h <dig> phosphorylation is most likely through an atm -mediated inhibition of tlk <dig> through chk <dig>  <cit>  and not a change in the cell cycle  since the loss of h <dig> phosphorylation after uv was immediate and reversible.

in vitro assays to study the repair of uv-induced dna damage
we elected to use an in vitro reconstituted system to study the role of tlk1b in the repair process. for these assays we used uv-damaged bluescript plasmid which was preassembled into a chromatin template. nucleosome assembly on supercoiled plasmid was done by the deposition of histones using salt dialysis, and efficient assembly was confirmed by observation of a regularly protected dna ladder on digestion with micrococcal nuclease , as shown in figure 5a. as a control, bluescript plasmid not assembled into nucleosomes was digested completely by mnase, resulting in a smear . repair on pre-assembled nucleosomal templates was measured by the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides into plasmid dna during repair synthesis catalyzed by nuclear extracts of mm3mg and mm3-tlk1b cell lines. unirradiated plasmid dna was used as a negative control, and only minimal background incorporation of label was observed in this mock ner assay. figures 6a and 6b show that only reactions with irradiated plasmid dna show incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotide, which suggests that the label is incorporated at sites of repair of uv damage, and the fact that more than twice as much repair is seen in the reactions containing extracts from mm3-tlk1b cells indicates that the presence of tlk1b stimulates repair. similar results were obtained when plasmids not preassembled into nucleosomes were used for the repair assay , but we should point out that this is likely due to the fact that the plasmid was getting assembled into chromatin by extract-mediated chaperones and endogenous histones .

tlk1b stimulates chromatin assembly in vitro
from the results obtained in figure  <dig>  it can be inferred that there is more efficient dna repair of the plasmids incubated with mm3-tlk1b extracts. the only currently known substrates of tlk <dig>  are histone h <dig>  <cit>  and asf <dig>  <cit> , which suggest that perhaps chromatin remodeling is involved in the more efficient repair process. the bluescript dna was fully competent as a substrate for repair synthesis, but the previous assay yielded little evidence about the chromatin remodeling capacity of the mm3mg and mm3-tlk1b extracts. therefore, we investigated the ability of tlk1b to enhance the assembly of chromatin by an in vitro plasmid supercoiling assay . in this assay, the bluescript plasmid  was used as a template for the deposition of core histones in the presence of mm3mg nuclear extract and an energy mix. in the absence of exogenous histones, the extract causes the bacterially supercoiled form to convert to mostly the relaxed form due to endogenous topoisomerases . however, after incubation in the presence of histones, the plasmid migrates as a series of discrete supercoiled forms due to the formation of nucleosomes, which decrease the linking number by one integer  per nucleosome. the addition of recombinant tlk1b stimulated the formation of the more highly supercoiled forms, particularly a form that comigrates with the bacterially supercoiled plasmid , and thus maybe fully assembled into nucleosomes, i.e. one nucleosome per  <dig> bp, mimicking the superhelical density  of the bacterially propagated plasmid. asf <dig> has been shown to stimulate chromatin assembly in vitro  <cit> . when recombinant asf1b protein was added to the in vitro reaction , it also increased the supercoiling. strikingly, maximum supercoiling was seen in lane  <dig> when both asf <dig> and tlk1b were included. this increase in supercoiling is possibly due to the interaction of tlk1b with asf <dig>  wherein tlk1b increases the chromatin assembly activity of asf <dig>  the results of the supercoiling assay are further confirmed by the densitometric analysis of each lane . in comparison to lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  lanes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show an additional band , which, as discussed above, may represent the fully supercoiled topoisomer that runs like the most supercoiled band in lane  <dig>  however, the intensity of this band is 5– <dig> fold higher in lane  <dig>  as compared to lanes  <dig> and  <dig> 

the importance of tlk <dig>  in the chromatin assembly is further demonstrated when an antibody that inactivates tlk <dig> is added to the in vitro chromatin assembly reaction prior to the addition of the plasmid. as is seen in figure 7b, addition of anti-tlk <dig> antibody decreased the supercoiling , while no appreciable effect was seen when a non-specific antibody was used . at the same time, addition of recombinant tlk1b protein to the tlk-depleted extract could restore the supercoiling activity considerably, indicating that the recombinant protein could complement the depletion by the antibody . both extracts showed very similar results in this case.

to analyze the supercoiling activity of the two extracts during repair synthesis  a similar assay was performed, but using completely relaxed uv-damaged plasmid as a substrate. in such an assay, ner nicking of the plasmid at cpds will tend to maintain the plasmid in a relaxed form, whereas at the same time extract-mediated chromatin assembly will decrease the superhelicity of the plasmid generating faster migrating forms. as shown in figure  <dig>  completely relaxed uv-damaged plasmid was incubated with either mm3mg or mm3-tlk1b extract. as a control, undamaged plasmid was used for comparison. from the figure, it is clear that the mm3-tlk1b extract induces more supercoiling of the uv-damaged plasmid, while the plasmid remains in its relaxed form when incubated with the mm3-mg extract . this confirmed that the tlk1b extract has better chromatin remodeling activity for uv-damaged plasmids.

role of tlk1-asf <dig> relationship in dna repair
the role of asf <dig> in dna repair and maintenance of genomic integrity has been well documented. cells lacking caf- <dig> and rcaf   <cit>  are hypersensitive to dna-damaging agents, such as camptothecin, suggesting a possible defect in double-strand break  repair  <cit> . in budding yeast lacking asf <dig>  there is activation of the dna damage checkpoint  <cit> . asf <dig> has also been shown to act synergistically with caf- <dig> to assemble nucleosomes during nucleotide excision repair in vitro  <cit> . it is possible that increased repair synthesis by the mm3-tlk1b extracts can be attributed to more efficient chromatin remodeling coupled dna repair because of a more active asf <dig>  if tlk1b increases the activity of asf <dig>  then addition of asf <dig> should give a comparable result as addition of tlk1b. in order to determine this, the in vitro repair assay was repeated on the uv-damaged nucleosomal bluescript template, but with increasing amounts of recombinant asf1b protein. since the effect of mm3-tlk1b on repair synthesis was evident as early as  <dig> minutes , this assay was performed for  <dig> minutes. the results are shown in figure 9a. as seen before, the repair synthesis by the mm3-tlk1b extracts was several fold higher than that by the mm3mg extracts . however with increase in the amount of asf1b protein , there was a considerably higher amount of datp incorporation by the mm3mg cell extracts . addition of recombinant asf1b protein also increased the repair synthesis in case of the plasmid treated with the mm3-tlk1b extract. in fact, addition of recombinant asf1b resulted in a similar increase in datp incorporation in both the cases . a graphical representation with three repeats of this experiment is shown in figure 9b.

when a western blot for asf1b was done on whole cell extracts of both the cell lines, we clearly detected higher migrating forms of the protein in the mm3-tlk1b extracts as compared to the mm3mg extracts , indicating that it is more phosphorylated. that the slower migrating forms were due to phosphorylation was confirmed when treatment with calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase  caused the asf1b in the tlk1b cells to migrate like the asf1b in the mm3mg cells. the most direct interpretation of these results is that tlk1b extracts have increased activity of asf <dig> due to phosphorylation.

the role of asf <dig> was further demonstrated by the results shown in figure 10a. in this case the repair assay was done in the same way as described before , but asf1-antiserum was added to the reaction mix, prior to addition of the plasmid . that the asf1-antibodies bind the native proteins was determined by immunoprecipitation . as a control, the reaction was also done in the presence of a non-specific antibody . there was a significant decrease in the repair synthesis in the presence of asf <dig> antiserum . only when the reaction was allowed to continue for a longer time , did the repair synthesis reach levels similar to that seen in lane <dig>  similar results were obtained with both the mm3mg and mm3-tlk1b extracts. this shows that asf <dig> is important for the dna repair process, even in the presence of tlk1b in the extract. interestingly, asf- <dig> depletion did not show any appreciable effect in case of repair assays that were done on non-chromatin uv-damaged templates . this indicates that asf <dig> only affects repair during assembly/disassembly of chromatin, and it is not intrinsically increasing the overall repair reaction on uv damaged templates.

the effect of the asf1-antiserum could also be complemented by adding back recombinant asf1b protein, indicating that it was specifically interfering with the asf <dig> function during the repair process .

role of tlk1b in the dna repair process
next, we tested the role of tlk1b itself using the in vitro assays . the in vitro repair assay was repeated as before, however, in the presence  or absence  of tlk- <dig> antiserum. as a control, a non-specific antibody  was also used. we saw that the repair synthesis diminished by half  as compared to the control extracts , as indicated by the amount of radiolabel incorporated. however, when increasing amounts of recombinant tlk1b were added to the in vitro reaction, it could restore repair synthesis in the tlk-depleted extracts. here too, similar results were seen in case of both mm3mg and mm3-tlk1b extracts.

discussion
tlk <dig> and tlk <dig> were originally cloned during a pcr-based search for human kinases  <cit> . we identified a splice variant of tlk <dig>  using a completely different approach, based on differential redistribution of transcripts on the polysomes of cells overexpressing the translation factor eif4e  <cit> . it stands to reason that the phenotypical changes induced by eif4e overexpression, which include transformation in several cell lines, would be mediated by a change in the recruitment of mrnas on the polysomes and the corresponding increase in protein expression. one of the known changes induced by eif4e is an increase in resistance to genotoxins and resistance to apoptosis  <cit> . we then set out to uncover that tlk1b was conferring resistance to ir when overexpressed by itself even in the absence of eif4e. in this report, we set out to study whether the effects of another genotoxin  could also be attenuated by overexpressing tlk1b, and if so, the possible mechanism for uv resistance, which we postulate is mediated through upregulation of asf <dig> activity.

in a previous publication we had shown that tlk1b overexpression induced resistance to ir and this was due to more efficient chromatin remodeling coupled to dna repair  <cit> . to assess whether tlk1b protected cells from uv-induced dna damage, we carried out clonogenic assays which showed a highly significant increase in survival, while the converse was observed in a cell line expressing a dominant negative mutant of tlk1b. this indicated that tlk1b might have a more general role in repair of dna damage than just protection from ir. indeed, we subsequently found that the repair of genomic dna following exposure to uv was faster and more efficient in mm3-tlk1b cells as compared to mm3mg cells. in addition, repair of uv damaged episomes in the tlk1b overexpressing cells was also significantly faster and more complete than in control cells. we should point out that the episomes are packed in regular chromatin in mammalian cells and thus mimic repair of genomic dna  <cit> . so episomal repair can be taken as an indicator of the repair that occurs on genomic dna, which is generally more difficult to assess in vivo. to assess the mechanism of tlk1b-induced resistance to uv radiation, we resorted to in vitro assays for a more direct assessment. we assayed uv-damaged plasmids that had been packaged into chromatin for two main reasons. first, chromatin is the authentic substrate of ner in vivo, and second, the effect of tlk1b was expected to be most likely due to a change in chromatin remodeling capacity.

the role of chromatin remodeling in cellular processes like transcription is well established, but only recently is it being studied in the context of dna repair. several lines of evidence clearly indicate that the presence of nucleosomes on damaged dna severely hampers access of the dna repair machinery  <cit> . at the same time, chromatin remodeling facilitates the repair process. recombinant acf, an atp-dependent chromatin remodeling factor, was found to facilitate the dual incision on a dinucleosomal template  <cit> . the cockayne syndrome-b  protein involved in transcription-coupled repair has homology to the swi/snf <dig> family of chromatin remodeling complexes and has chromatin remodeling activity  <cit> . although not a classic 'chromatin remodeler', the histone chaperone asf <dig> plays an important role in several processes that are very much dependent on the chromatin structure. in addition to its well-studied role in chromatin assembly, yeast asf <dig> has also been shown to be important in silencing, transcription, dna replication and normal cell cycle progression  <cit> . most importantly though, asf <dig> has been implicated in the maintenance of genomic integrity  <cit> . yeast cells deleted for asf <dig> are highly sensitive to dna-damaging agents  <cit>  and asf <dig> mutants have an increased rate of genomic instability  <cit> . in mammalian cells, asf <dig> is phosphorylated by tlk <dig>  in fact, the only two known substrates of tlk <dig> thus far are histone h <dig> and asf <dig>  also, asf <dig> phosphorylation in the s-phase has been shown to correlate with tlk <dig> activity  <cit> . this suggests that tlk <dig> and tlk1b have a function in chromatin remodeling, particularly tlk1b, which may have a function in remodeling during the dna damage repair pathway by ner.

we have shown in this study that the extract containing tlk1b was far more active, both in repair of uv-damaged chromatin templates, as well as plasmid supercoiling. the role of tlk1/tlk1b was further confirmed by immuno-inactivation/complementation experiments. tlk1b's effect is almost certainly due to modulation of asf <dig> activity, as addition of asf <dig> alone to control extracts could restore repair activity to the level seen with tlk1b-containing extract, while asf <dig> depletion resulted in a considerable decrease in the repair synthesis. it should be noted that depletion of asf <dig> resulted in a decrease in the repair synthesis only in the earlier time points, but by one hour, the final extent of repair was equivalent to that seen with extract incubated with a non-specific antibody . a recent study showed that asf <dig> increased the rate of histone eviction at the pho <dig> promoter in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . in the absence of asf <dig> histone eviction was delayed but the final outcome of the chromatin transition was not affected. our results indicate a similar finding. asf <dig> depletion probably results in inefficient disassembly of chromatin at the sites of dna damage, resulting in a delay in repair. but at later time points , there is chromatin remodeling followed by repair of the damage.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results show that tlk1b enhances the repair of uv-damaged dna in the context of chromatin, and most likely does so through the action of asf <dig>  though other possible substrates cannot be excluded. the future challenge will be to determine if there are other substrates of this kinase, and if so, whether they have any role in dna damage-response and repair.
