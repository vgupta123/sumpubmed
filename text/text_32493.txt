BACKGROUND
severe acute respiratory syndrome  emerged in  <dig>  as a new epidemic form of life-threatening infection  <cit> . as of september  <dig>  there were  <dig> cases of sars from  <dig> countries with  <dig> deaths . sars is characterized by high fever, malaise, rigors, headache, dry cough, and progression to interstitial infiltration in lungs with eventual mortality of greater than 10% in many countries  <cit> . sars has been shown to be caused by a novel coronavirus; sars-cov, with genome sequences recently published  <cit> . however, the pathogenesis of sars is poorly understood. major hematological features of this disease are lymphopenia, transient thrombocytopenia, and normal neutrophil and monocyte counts  <cit> . it has been shown that sars coronavirus infects and replicates in a wide variety of host cells, including pbmcs, in susceptible animals and human beings  <cit> . hence, to understand the host response to this pathogen, we profiled the gene expression patterns of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from sars patients, compared to healthy controls using oligo nucleotide microarrays. we found that in the pbmc from sars patients a number of genes were differentially expressed, as compared to healthy controls, including immune-related genes and these genes are not the typical ones expected in a viral infection.

during a viral infection, most cell types in the body respond by secreting high levels of type  <dig> interferons   <cit> . ifn-α/β can directly induce antiviral activities in neighboring cells, preventing viral spread by increasing the resistance of uninfected cells toward the virus. moreover, these ifns can activate natural killer  cells mediated cytotoxity toward virus-infected cells  <cit> , and there is accumulating evidence that ifn-α/β contribute to driving the adaptive-immune response in the t helper cell type  <dig>  direction, via stimulation of ifn-γ expression  <cit> . nk cells can produce ifn-γ  <cit> , which activates leukocytes, such as monocytes/macrophages, that, in turn, participate in the antiviral responses by producing free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α  <cit> . during the response to viral infections, a key role is played by the expansion and activation of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, which are central to the antiviral immunity, including their capability to inhibit replication and clear the infection. cd8+ cells have a direct effector role through cytotoxic t lymphocyte mediated lysis, and cytokine and chemokine production  <cit> . the role of cd4+ t cells in antiviral immunity is highly dependent on production of cytokines, notably ifn-γ  <cit> , and the cytolytic activity exerted by a subset of cd4+ t cells  <cit> . activation, coordination, and regulation of the above-described antiviral responses are mediated by complex mechanisms, where cytokines play important roles. however, to our surprise, we found that the patients' response of sars appears to be mainly an innate inflammatory response, rather than a specific immune response against a viral infection. there is no significant level of up-regulation of mhc-i genes, neither for major cytokines including ifns, nor for genes involved in complement mediated cytolysis, suggesting that the immune response against sars-cov may be different from other viral infections.

RESULTS
to study the differential immune-gene expression patterns induced by sars coronavirus, pbmcs from patients with sars and normal subjects were examined using microarray technology. we shooed to use pbmcs as these cells are more easily obtained from patients compared to other infected tissues, and the sars-cov has recently been shown to infect pbmcs  <cit> . the method of global gene expression analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays has proven to be a sensitive method to develop and refine the molecular determinants of several human disorders, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, and has provided us with signatures of the immune response  <cit> . using this technology, complemented with powerful analytical methods, we compared the gene expression profiles of pbmc from a series of sars patients with those of healthy donors. to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the microarray analysis, pearson correlation factors using the signal from all the normal samples were calculated. all four control arrays have pearson correlation coefficients  of > <dig> , which suggests an excellent reproducibility among individual arrays in the same experiment and between normal control experiments.

we analyzed the expression pattern of over ~ <dig>  genes from the pbmcs of  <dig> sars patients, and compared the expression patterns with healthy control samples. student's unpaired t-test  was performed and significant genes were selected. cluster analysis was performed to find distinct groups of genes that were significantly changed. the criteria used for cluster analysis is different from filter criteria used for differentially expressed genes.  <dig> genes were selected for hierarchical clustering  which includes all the  <dig> differentially expressed genes. the severity of the disease does not seem to change the genetic profile of the pbmcs:  <dig> of our patients were in intensive care, whereas the other  <dig> patients did not require intensive care, at the time the blood was taken. however, no substantial gene-expression differences were observed that could correlate to disease severity.

to our surprise, the expression of genes coding for cytokines was completely absent, and the immune-related genes which were overexpressed are usually associated with innate-immune response against bacterial infection and not against a viral infection . several genes were highly up-regulated in patients with sars, such as, genes coding for lactoferrin, s100a <dig> and lipocalin  <dig> among others . lactoferrin is a 78- to 80-kda glycoprotein synthesized by glandular epithelial cells and mature neutrophils, frequently used as a marker for neutrophil degranulation at sites of inflammation, having well recognized bacteristatic and bactericidal properties  <cit> . it is now clear that the biological actions of lactoferrin are not restricted to its bacteristatic and bactericidal properties. indeed, a wide array of actions has been reported for lactoferrin, including enhancing nk cell activity, as well as stimulating neutrophil aggregation and adhesion  <cit> . the myeloid-related proteins, s100a <dig>  s100a <dig>  and s100a <dig> have been shown to regulate lymphocyte, monocyte, and neutrophil migration and are found in the extracellular milieu during infections and inflammatory episodes  <cit> . the high levels of serum s100a8/a <dig> in chronic inflammatory pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as during bronchitis and tuberculosis  <cit> , suggest that they might play a role in inflammatory reactions.

lipocalins are a family of small, secreted proteins, which have little amino acid sequence homology  but share a common three-dimensional structure  <cit> . tissue distribution studies have revealed that a member of this family 24p <dig> lipocalin  is mainly expressed in the liver during an acute phase response  <cit> . it has also been detected in spleen, lung and the uterus. in the latter location, its expression has been found to be coincident with parturition, a time of major tissue remodeling and inflammation  <cit> . 24p <dig> has also been detected in the conditioned media of lps stimulated murine pu <dig> . <dig> macrophages and therefore it has been suggested to function in defense against infectious agents  <cit> . however, recent evidence proposed that the lipocalins may trigger apoptosis in immune cells via an unknown cell surface receptor  <cit> . sars patients with respiratory distress fulfill criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome  and diffuse alveolar damage is seen in the lungs on histological examination of postmortem  <cit> . we speculate that upregulation of lipocalins are part of the host response in limiting unwanted tissue damage and in reducing inflammation and lung fibrosis. in addition, enhanced expression of lipocalins may play a role in the potential cause of lymphopenia observed in the majority of patients.

there is also up-regulation of expression of genes, such us, bactericidal permeability increasing protein  and carcino embryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule  <dig> . bpi is released from activated neutrophils and is an endogenous antibiotic, which rapidly kills gram negative bacteria by high affinity binding to the lps component of the cell wall  <cit> . ceacam  <dig> is expressed by activated monocytes and granulocytes, and significant up-regulation of this gene indicates the involvement of innate immune cells in sars. other genes which encode proteins like leukotrien-b <dig> receptor , leukotrien-a <dig> hydrolase, il- <dig> receptor , anaphylatoxin c3a receptor- <dig> , neutrophil cytosolic factor  <dig> , s <dig> calcium binding protein a <dig>  defensin, , lps binding protein cap <dig> , and peptidoglycan recognition protein  are involved in chemotaxis, inflammatory reaction and superoxide metabolism  <cit> . similarly, formyl peptidase receptor  genes are expressed by activated neutrophils. regulation of expression of fpr on neutrophils plays a key role in neutrophil polarization and chemotaxis. chemotaxis is effected by a neutrophil membrane mesh, via remodeling of the actin component of the membrane  <cit> . up-regulation of cd <dig> and fcγr3a indicates some degree of neutrophil, b cell and nk cell activity. fcγr3a, a low affinity receptor for igg, expressed in activated macrophages and nk cells, facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity  by nk cells  <cit> .

there is moderate up-regulation of the kappa light chain of the nuclear factor  and the b-cell lymphoma 3-encoded protein  . the major form of nfκb is a heterodimer of p65/p <dig> subunits, which regulates expression of many proteins in activated immune cells by binding to dna. it interacts with nfκb through its ankyrin repeats and it favors p <dig> dimerization by recruiting p <dig> monomers from the cytoplasmic pool of p105/p <dig> dimers, and thereby enhancing nuclear translocation and dna binding of p <dig> dimers  <cit> . blc <dig> is expressed by activated b cells and t cells on mitotic stimuli, playing an important role in transcription activation  <cit> .

in sars patients there is down-regulation of genes  which regulate proliferation and differentiation of t-cells, such as the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase , which is required for phosphorylation of cd <dig>  there is down-regulation of genes coding for the epsilon polypeptide of the tcr , il- <dig> induced t-cell kinase , the zeta chain of the tcr , the alpha  <dig> subunit of vla- <dig> receptor , the chemokine  receptor  <dig> , and the interleukin  <dig> receptor alpha . all these point to a potential state of unresponsiveness towards the sars-cov antigens. it has been described that t cell function in patients with peritonitis had decreased th <dig> function, without increased th <dig> response, and furthermore t cell proliferation and cytokine secretion correlated with mortality  <cit> . in our study, there is up-regulation of genes involved in homeostasis and cell growth ; for example, genes involved in dna synthesis, nucleosome assembly and protein synthesis, such as, genes encoding translation initiation factor 1a , and histone proteins. there is down-regulation of genes coding for negative regulators of the cell cycle, such as, retinoblastoma-like  <dig> protein , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b  and anti-apoptoic protein tnf induced protein gg2- <dig> etc . these findings indicate a high degree of proliferation of immune cells; however, there is no significant level of increase in the expression of cytokines like il- <dig> or il- <dig> and their receptors, which are required for the proliferation and the differentiation of t cells and effector functions of b cells and nk cells. so the increased cell proliferation may be of a granulocyte lineage rather than a monocytic lineage. we confirmed our microarrays findings by real time pcr on selected upregulated genes such as lactoferrin lipocalin, s100p, fcgr3a, and tlr <dig> . the average expression of all the five genes by real-time rt-pcr was compared to the average expression levels found by microarray analysis . the real-time pcr method verified the results of the gene array analysis and showed that those genes that were up-regulated as determined by microarray analysis were found to be up-regulated by real-time pcr analysis. moreover, since we did not find any upregulation of cytokine-genes usually associated with a viral infection, we selected a few cytokines and compared the sars samples, with samples collected from  <dig> influenza virus-infected patients. the observed results, in figure  <dig>  showed that in the influenza patients the mrna for type i interferons , tnfα and il-12-p <dig> were upregulated, whereas genes upregulated in the sars patients , were not upregulated in the influenza patients. therefore, firstly, this confirms that cytokines usually triggered during a viral infection were not detected in the sars samples ; and secondly, genes triggered in the sars patients were not triggered in influenza patients.

in this study we have performed extensive analysis of gene expression of pbmcs of sars patients using a microarray platform that includes more than  <dig> gene sequences. however, one potential drawback in our current experimental design is that the gene expression levels were compared between patient samples and normal controls using pbmcs, rather than purified individual cell types. while it would be of interest to determine the exact proportions of monocytes, lymphocytes and contaminating granulocytes in our pbmc preparations, unfortunately, given the highly infective nature of patient samples and lack of suitable flowcytometry facility with appropriate bio-safety control, facs analysis was, however, not possible.

our results suggest that the response of sars affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response, rather than a specific immune response against a viral infection. there is no significant level of up-regulation of mhc-i genes or major cytokines including ifns , or genes involved in complement mediated cytolysis, suggesting that the immune response against the sars-cov may be different from other viral infections, or that the virus may be using a unusual strategy to evade the host immune system and cause the pathogenesis and mortality.

CONCLUSIONS
this differential gene expression profiling of pbmcs from patients with sars, strongly suggests that the response of sars affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response, rather than a specific immune response against a viral infection. there is no significant level of up-regulation of mhc-i genes or major cytokines, including ifns, or complement mediated cytolysis, suggesting that the immune response against the sars-cov may be different from other viral infections or that the virus may be using a different strategy to evade the host immune system and cause the pathogenesis and mortality. the severity of the disease does not seem to change the genetic profile of the pbmcs:  <dig> of our patients were in intensive care, whereas the other  <dig> patients did not require intensive care, at the time the blood was taken. however, no substantial gene-expression differences were observed that could correlate to disease severity. moreover, we confirmed  that cytokines usually associated with viral infections  were not detected in the sars samples, but were triggered in another viral infection . we also showed that genes triggered in the sars patients were not triggered in the influenza patients.

our study shows, for the first time, how the immune system responds to the sars infection and opens new possibilities for designing new diagnostics and treatments for this new life-threatening disease.
