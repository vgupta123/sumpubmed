BACKGROUND
scrapie is an infectious disease, but one that is unusual in that the incubation period leading to clinical disease is governed by a strong host genetic component  <cit>  and a strong dose-response relationship  <cit> . these factors can interact to yield intriguing epidemiological patterns.

during an outbreak, the prp genotypes of affected animals are expected to change over time. those encoding prp genotypes with the shortest incubation periods should be the first to reach clinical onset, followed by their co-occurrence with those encoding prp genotypes with longer incubation periods, then those with the longest incubation periods. if most sheep are infected at a similar age, this could manifest as a change in the age-at-onset of scrapie over time. the level of infectivity to which susceptible animals are exposed could also increase through the epidemic as the cumulative total of infected animals rises. a higher dose may shorten the incubation period and lead to a reduction in the age-at-onset over time. if prp genotype, incubation period or age-at-onset change with time during an outbreak, then any linkage between any of these factors and the clinical signs of scrapie could also lead to changes in the clinical manifestation of the disease over time. a time course of clinical signs may also arise from the farmer, who may be able to recognise scrapie on the basis of fewer or different clinical signs as more cases are encountered.

these ideas are supported by the reports of farmers running commercial flocks affected by natural scrapie. in a field study undertaken by the institute for animal health , twenty-four percent of farmers reported a change in the clinical signs being reported through the course of a scrapie epidemic, while thirty-five percent reported a change in the ages of cases.

detection of a time trend, and teasing apart the causal factors behind it, is made difficult by the small number of cases confirmed in most outbreaks and the range of prp genotypes involved. furthermore, variability between flocks in the characteristics of outbreaks precludes, in most cases, the combining of datasets.

here, we have investigated in detail the scrapie outbreak of one of very few flocks for which sufficient data are available for time course analysis. between  <dig> and  <dig> there were over  <dig> confirmed cases of scrapie in a single flock of welsh mountain sheep. almost all cases were in just two genotypes. this outbreak is possibly the largest reported for any flock in great britain over the same time period. the scale of the outbreak gave us an opportunity to explore in detail the time course of the scrapie epidemic at the level of prp genotype and with extensive detail of the clinical presentation of disease.

RESULTS
the flock
ten  prp genotypes were found in this flock upon blood sampling in  <dig> . a quarter  carried the vrq allele , but only  <dig> % were of the most susceptible genotype, vrq/vrq. the genotype frequencies correspond to allele frequencies of: arr,  <dig> %; ahq,  <dig> %; arq,  <dig> %; and vrq,  <dig> %. the arh allele was not detected in this flock. animals also had prp haplotypes arq-f <dig> and arq-s <dig> which occurred at frequencies of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. neither of these haplotypes was associated with the occurrence of scrapie in this flock.

the outbreak
the farmer did not know at what point his flock acquired infection. although he thought that there had been one case of scrapie  in  <dig>  he did not recognise any more animals with scrapie-like signs until the start of the current epidemic in september  <dig>  the affected animals exhibited clinical signs of incoordination , nervousness/excitability  and rubbing/scratching ; he thought that both the clinical signs and the age of the animals succumbing to disease changed during the course of the epidemic.

between september  <dig> and february  <dig> there were  <dig> confirmed cases in the flock, in animals of  <dig> genotypes . the frequency of cases increased to a peak in  <dig> and subsequently decreased . the number of cases in  <dig> appears unusually low; this may be related to difficulties in reporting scrapie during the uk's foot-and-mouth disease epidemic. more cases were reported in the first than the second half of each year, but seasonal trends were not significant .

most cases were initially in animals of the vrq/vrq genotype, which peaked in  <dig>  after which cases became more prevalent in animals of the vrq/arq genotype, which peaked in  <dig> . three cases also occurred in animals of the less-susceptible vrq/arr genotype during the decline phase of the epidemic . considering only the time from when the flock was blood sampled, the proportion of animals which subsequently died from scrapie were:  <dig> %  in vrq/arr;  <dig> %  in vrq/arq; and  <dig> %  in vrq/vrq.

the time-course
as predicted, the genotype of cases changed during the time-course of the outbreak . earlier in the epidemic cases were more likely to be of the vrq/vrq than the vrq/arq genotype . exploratory analysis suggested that animals of the vrq/arr genotype were likely to exhibit clinical signs later in the epidemic than either vrq/arq or vrq/vrq animals , but their small sample size precluded more detailed analyses.

as observed by the farmer, cases which occurred later in the epidemic tended to be older than those seen earlier . cases of the vrq/vrq genotype developed clinical signs at an earlier age than vrq/arq animals , but age within each genotype did not change significantly during the outbreak . this implies that the increase in age-at-onset was due to changes in the prp genotype of cases rather than changes in age within each genotype.

clinical signs
analysis was undertaken for those clinical signs with sufficient observations : ataxia, change of behaviour, fleece loss, loss of condition, pruritus and trembling. as the epidemic progressed, animals were more likely to be reported showing a change in behaviour, independent of prp genotype . vrq/vrq animals were less likely to show loss of condition  or fleece loss  as the outbreak progressed. this pattern was not seen in vrq/arq cases. throughout the outbreak, older cases of any genotype were more likely to show ataxia  and trembling  than younger ones. finally, animals exhibiting fleece loss were more likely to be of the vrq/vrq rather than the vrq/arq genotype .

discussion
although there have been several studies describing within-flock outbreaks of scrapie  <cit>  the results of this paper represent the first analysis addressing confounding between the effects of time since the beginning of the epidemic, age at onset and prp genotype. the major limitations of this study are that we do not know when the flock first became infected with scrapie; and genotypes were unavailable for  <dig> cases, including the first  <dig> during the epidemic.

an interesting feature of this outbreak is that cases occurred in the vrq/vrq, vrq/arq and vrq/arr genotypes only, despite the high frequency of sheep of the arq/arq and vrq/ahq genotypes in the flock . these findings confirm the resistance of the vrq/ahq genotype to classical scrapie  <cit>  and the resistance of the arq/arq genotype to certain scrapie strains in some sheep breeds  <cit> .

a key finding of this study is that the cases which occurred later in the outbreak tended to be older. our analysis has shown that this is not related to changes in the age-at-onset within each genotype during the outbreak. rather, it is an effect of the prp genotype of cases, which influences the age at which animals succumb to disease. our results differ from an earlier study, which reported a decline in the age-at-onset for four outbreaks  <cit> , though the decline was significant  in only one outbreak in a flock of suffolk sheep  <cit> . this suffolk flock was bred to maximise the incidence of disease; hence, susceptible animals were constantly being introduced to the flock and exposed to an increasing load of infection. by contrast, most, though not all, susceptible animals in our study flock succumbed to scrapie, but their susceptible alleles were not replaced. the resulting pattern of the outbreak means that animals of the same genotype were, on average, exposed to similar loads of infection.

animals of the vrq/vrq genotype had a younger age-at-onset than vrq/arq animals , in common with other studies  <cit> . the age at onset of clinical signs depends on a number of factors, including the infectious load, age-dependent exposure, age-dependent susceptibility and incubation period. modelling analysis of an outbreak in a cheviot flock suggested that the incubation period for vrq/vrq animals was shorter than that for vrq/arq and that there was evidence for age-dependent susceptibility  <cit> . this suggests that the differences in the age-at-onset are likely to reflect differences in incubation period rather than age-dependent exposure. more detailed analyses are needed, however, to tease apart the interactions of various age and genotype effects in the age-at-onset of clinical signs.

our study is the first to report changes in clinical signs during a scrapie outbreak. animals were more likely to be reported showing a change of behaviour as the epidemic progressed, irrespective of prp genotype. one hypothesis would be that at the start of the epidemic the farmer required physical signs to identify scrapie, but as the epidemic progressed he became better able to detect disease on the basis of more subtle behavioural changes. indeed, behavioural changes are reported prior to the onset of other clinical signs in both goats  <cit>  and mice  <cit> .

temporal changes in clinical signs also differed between prp genotypes. early in the epidemic, vrq/vrq animals were more likely to show loss of condition and fleece loss/change, while those reported later in the epidemic were less likely to do so. this could be related to the aforementioned greater reliance of the farmer on physical  signs earlier in the outbreak; however, this seems unlikely, as the pattern did not occur in animals of the vrq/arq genotype. alternatively the effect may be real, or it may reflect variation in the clinical signs recorded by the seven reporting officers. exploratory analysis provided some support for this latter hypothesis, but there were too few cases to be able to test this rigorously.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we have described one of the largest scrapie outbreaks in the uk. as the cases were almost exclusively in two genotypes, this has facilitated the investigation of the effect of prp genotype on other epidemiological parameters. although age-at-onset and clinical signs changed over time, our analysis indicated that the effect was largely, but not exclusively, driven by the time course in the prp genotype of cases.
