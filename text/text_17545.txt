BACKGROUND
fungi can produce diverse secondary metabolites with antibacterial activity against numerous microorganisms. among these metabolites, penicillin represents the starting point of the discovery of highly effective antibiotics, a milestone in therapeutic medicine  <cit> . to date, only the filamentous ascomycete penicillium chrysogenum is used industrially to obtain economically relevant penicillin titers  <cit> .

in the first reaction of penicillin biosynthesis, the three precursor amino acids l-α-aminoadipic acid, l-cysteine, and l-valine are condensed to the tripeptide δ--l-cysteinyl-d-valine . this step is catalyzed by acv synthetase, a single multifunctional enzyme with non-ribosomal peptide synthetase activity that is coded by the pcbab gene . the second step is characterized by the oxidative ring closure of the linear acv tripeptide, leading to the formation of a bicyclic ring comprising the β-lactam and thiazolidine ring. this reaction is catalyzed by the isopenicillin n synthase, encoded by the pcbc gene . the resulting compound, isopenicillin n, is the first bioactive intermediate of the penicillin biosynthesis pathway. in the third reaction of penicillin biosynthesis, the hydrophilic l-α-aminoadipate side chain of isopenicillin n is exchanged for a hydrophobic phenylacetyl or phenoxyacetyl group, resulting in the formation of penicillin g and penicillin v, respectively. this final step is catalyzed by the acyl-coenzyme a: isopenicillin n acyltransferase, and the corresponding gene is pende  .

all three penicillin biosynthesis genes occur in a single cluster that is structurally conserved in pro- and eukaryotic microbial producers. this shared characteristic supports the hypothesis that fungi have acquired these genes from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer  <cit> .

the progenitor of all industrially used p. chrysogenum strains is strain nrrl  <dig> , which was isolated in  <dig> from a moldy cantaloupe in peoria, il. since then, this strain and its descendants have been subjected to strong mutagenic treatments during strain improvement programs. this pressure has not only resulted in sharply increased antibiotic production but also in increased copy number of the penicillin biosynthesis cluster in some high-production strains, several of which harbor as many as  <dig> copies of the cluster . for example, in the high producer as-p- <dig>  a  <dig> -kb dna region comprising the pen cluster is amplified in tandem repeats of five or six copies linked by conserved hexanucleotide sequences, whereas wild-type strains contain a single copy of this region  <cit> . fierro et al.  <cit>  proposed that the amplification occurred by mutation-induced site-specific recombination at the conserved hexanucleotide sequences. the amplified region is not identical in the different high-producing strains tested, although the mechanism of amplification is probably similar.

another descendant of strain nrrl  <dig>  obtained by x-ray and uv mutagenesis, is the former industrial strain p. chrysogenum p <dig>   <cit> , which shows a 85-fold increased penicillin titer compared to its ancestor. this strain was used for conventional mutagenesis to construct p2niad <dig>  a nitrate reductase-deficient derivative  <cit> . recently, whole genome sequencing of this strain revealed that chromosome i carries a tandem repeat duplication of the penicillin biosynthesis cluster comprising genes pcbab, pcbc, and pende  <cit> .

here, we performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  to further determine the size of the duplicated region. the pfge revealed that a genomic region of about 110 kb, which harbors the pen cluster, is duplicated in the high-producer strain compared to the wild-type strain. most strikingly, the loss of one of these copies did not result in decreased penicillin production, thus indicating that the copy number is not responsible for high production in p2niad <dig>  although the penicillin biosynthesis pathway is well-studied and the enzymes involved are characterized in detail  <cit> , little is known about the complex regulatory mechanisms behind this process. our results indicate that instead, regulation of penicillin biosynthesis may have a far more important effect on the amount of penicillin that the fungus produces and therefore represents an important starting point for targeted strain improvement programs.

recombinant plasmids were generated using either standard laboratory techniques  <cit>  or the in-fusion® hd cloning kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with escherichia coli strain xl1-blue mrf’ as host for general plasmid construction and maintenance  <cit> .

construction of plasmids
all plasmids used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  for generation of a pcbc deletion plasmid, the 5’ and 3’ regions of pcvelb in plasmid pkovelb  were replaced by 1-kb 5’ and 3’ flanking regions of pcbc, via sphi and mlui  and nhei and noti restriction sites , respectively, resulting in plasmid pkopcbcfrtble. in an alternative approach, the 5’ flank of pcvosa in plasmid pkovosa  <cit>  was replaced by pcbc-specific flanks, using the sfui and ndei restriction sites. the 3’ pcvosa flank was replaced by the 3’ pcbc flank using the in-fusion® hd cloning kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions, resulting in plasmid pkopcbcfrtnat. for complementation by homologous integration, the pcbc open reading frame  was introduced behind the 5’ pcbc flank of plasmid pkopcbcfrtnat by using the ndei restriction site. to achieve complementation by ectopic integration of a pcbc-egfp fusion construct, the pcbc orf was integrated using the ncoi and noti sites of p1783-1nat. finally, for complementation of the pcbc null mutant with the complete penicillin biosynthesis cluster, plasmid ppcpv <dig> was used. this plasmid has a size of  <dig>  kb and also carries the bacterial ampicillin resistance gene and the a. nidulans niia and niad genes, a  <dig>  kb fragment with the penicillin biosynthesis gene cluster  from p. chrysogenum . the nucleotide sequence of the penicillin gene cluster is identical in nrrl <dig> , wisconsin 1255- <dig>  <cit> , and p2niad <dig>  <cit> , and the same result was reported for another high titer strain bw <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig> plasmids used in this study

construction of knockout mutants and complementation strains
to generate a pcbc null mutant, strain ∆pcku <dig>  was used as a recipient. after restriction of plasmid pkopcbcfrtble with pvuii, the knockout cassette harboring the 5’ and 3’ flanking regions of pcbc, two frt sites, and a phleomycin resistance cassette was introduced into the genome of ∆pcku <dig>  by homologous recombination. the recombination event was verified by pcr and southern analysis. sequences of oligonucleotides used in these studies are given in table  <dig> table  <dig> oligonucleotides used in this study

for complementation by homologous recombination, the pvuii fragment of ppcbcfrtnat, harboring the complementation cassette with the 5’ and 3’ flanking regions of pcbc, the pcbc orf, and a nourseothricin resistance cassette, was introduced into the pcbc null mutant. for ectopic complementation of a pcbc-egfp fusion construct, ∆pcbc was transformed with plasmid pgfp-pcbc resulting in the construction of ∆pcbc::pcbc-gfp. strains of both complementation variants were verified by pcr and southern analysis.

for complementation of ∆pcbc with the complete penicillin biosynthesis cluster, plasmid ppcpv <dig> was transformed into the deletion mutant. the niad gene on ppcpv <dig> served as a selection marker, thus complementing the nitrate reductase deficiency of the deletion mutant.

preparation and analysis of nucleic acids
isolation of fungal genomic dna was carried out as described previously  <cit> , and dna was isolated from hyphal cells grown at 27 °c and at 120 rpm for 72 h in liquid media. southern blotting was performed with a genescreen hybridization transfer membrane , hybridized with dctp-labeled probes using standard methods  <cit> .

pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
protoplasts were treated as described previously to isolate intact chromosomes  <cit> . the chef mapper system  was used to separate large dna fragments  <cit> , which were obtained by hydrolysis with the rare-cutter endonucleases paci, pmei, and swai, as specified in the results section. pulse times were done for 18 h at 6 v/cm with initial switching intervals of 10 s and final switching intervals of 20 s.

qrt-pcr for quantification of the pcbc transcript
rna extraction for quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr  was performed using the rneasy® plus universal midi kit  according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. qrt-pcr analysis was performed as described previously  <cit> . amplification of the ssurrna  was used as a reference for normalization. sequences of oligonucleotides used for qrt-pcr are given in table  <dig> 

penicillin bioassay
for a penicillin bioassay, 100 ml of liquid complex medium were inoculated with 1 ×  <dig> spores. cultures were incubated for 96 h at 27 °c and 120 rpm. after being harvested, supernatants were used to perform the penicillin bioassay, with staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism. the obtained mycelia were used to measure the dry weight. all experiments were performed in triplicate from at least two independent isolates.

RESULTS
high-producer p2niad <dig> has a duplicated penicillin biosynthesis cluster
fungi have relatively small genomes on the order of about 30–40 mb, and can be separated on a single gel by pfge. this analysis can be extended by using rare cutting restriction enzymes, thus allowing determination of the chromosomal structure of a region of interest  <cit> . this approach is in particular reasonable for p. chrysogenum, which has only four chromosomes, because the two larger chromosomes with a size above 10 mb are difficult to separate electrophoretically  <cit> . here, we performed pfge  to compare the copy number of the penicillin biosynthesis cluster in the high producer p2niad <dig> with the wild-type strain nrrl  <dig>  the progenitor of all industrially used penicillin producers. p2niad <dig> is a derivatives of p <dig>  a former producer strain of nippon kayaku co. laboratories, and among the original strains of the panlabs series  <cit> . p <dig> and wisconsin 54- <dig> are two independently derived derivatives from the very early penicillin production strain q <dig>  which was later used for further strain improvement programs  <cit> .fig.  <dig> determination of the copy-number of different p. chrysogenum strains using pfge.  genetic map of the duplicated 110 kb pen cluster region, based on the recently published genome sequence  <cit> . the penicillin biosynthesis genes are marked in red and recombination sites are indicated in bold face  and are identical to those reported for other penicillium strains  <cit> .  simplified map of the penicillin genes and adjacent regions showing the probes  for southern hybridization experiments. in addition restriction sites for pmei, paci and swai are given.  pulsed field gel electrophoresis  of pmei, paci or swai restricted genomic dna. for these experiments, the original cantaloupe strain nrrl  <dig>  and the high-producer p2niad <dig>  were used. the duplicated area is given as a grey bar in ab, and fragments that indicate the proposed duplications are marked with a red asterisk in c




pfge was conducted with chromosomal dna of both strains cut with the three different rare cutting enzymes swai, paci, and pmei. after pfge, southern analysis with four different probes , pcbc , rco <dig> , and exo <dig> ) revealed several differences . for example, after restriction with both pmei and paci, an additional signal with a size of about 97 kb was present in the genomic dna of p2niad <dig> after hybridization with the probes pcbc and rco <dig>  after restriction with swai, a shift in the fragment size from about 230 kb to 340 kb occurred in p2niad <dig> for all probes except exo <dig> . these data confirmed that a genomic region of about 110 kb, which harbors the pen cluster, is duplicated in the high-producer strain compared to the wild-type strain. the recent genome sequence of p2niad <dig> revealed that the two copies of the pen cluster are identical at the nucleotide level, and the corresponding gene map is given in fig. 1a.

generation of a pcbc null mutant and different complementation strains
in the next set of experiments, we constructed strains lacking the pcbc gene . Δpcku <dig> ek <dig> served as parental strain for a series of derivatives, which are displayed in fig. 2c and are described further in the following section. previously, strain p2niad <dig> was used to generate a Δpcku <dig> strain for optimized homologous recombination, which was designated Δpcku <dig> ek <dig>  <cit> . both strains have a penicillin v titer of 3 g/l, when grown for 96 h in liquid shaking cultures  <cit> . Δpcku <dig> ek <dig> was transformed with a flipper cassette to generate a marker-free Δpcku <dig> strain  <cit>  in two steps. first, the nourseothricin resistance cassette of ∆pcku <dig> ek <dig> was replaced by a phleomycin resistance cassette flanked by frt sites, resulting in two independent isolates, named ∆pcku <dig>  t <dig> and ∆pcku <dig>  t <dig> . subsequently, both isolates were transformed with the free replicating plasmid pptrii_pcflp, which carries the pcflp gene coding for the flp recombinase, and isolates were named ∆pcku <dig>  t1- <dig> and ∆pcku <dig>  t17- <dig>  induction of the flipper-recombinase gene resulted in an excision of the phleomycin resistance cassette and the following loss of the free replicating plasmid results in the marker-free strains ∆pcku <dig>  t1- <dig> and ∆pcku <dig>  t17- <dig>  <cit> . pfge revealed, after restriction with pmei and subsequent hybridization with probe pcbc , that the primary transformant ∆pcku <dig>  t <dig>  as well ∆pcku <dig>  t1- <dig> had lost one copy of the pen cluster . in contrast, ∆pcku <dig>  t17- <dig> still carries both copies. in the next step, we used ∆pcku <dig>  t1- <dig> to construct a marker-free pcbc null mutant. this strain, designated Δpcbc t7- <dig>  was obtained by homologous recombination using the flipper cassette .fig.  <dig> pfge of p2niad <dig> and its derivatives indicate loss of one cluster copy. a
pmei restriction map of the duplicated penicillin cluster. b pfge was performed using restriction enzyme pmei and a genomic fragment comprising the pcbc gene as a probe. for p2niad <dig>  this results in two signals with the size of  <dig>  kb and 97 kb , thus indicating the duplication as proposed in a. during the generation of a marker-free Δpcku <dig> strain, the extra copy of the penicillin cluster was lost in t <dig> and its derivatives. in contrast, t <dig> and its derivatives still carry both copies . in Δpcbc, all copies of the pcbc gene were deleted, however a signal still occurs since the probe comprises the gene, the adjacent promotor region, and part of the flanking pende gene. c genealogy of penicillin production strains used in this study. the copy number of the penicillin gene cluster is given in red





the deletion of Δpcbc was further confirmed by pcr  and southern hybridization using the 3’ flanking region of pcbc as a probe . as an example, three independently derived transformants  are shown.

to generate penicillin-producing strains from the above-described null mutant, the pcbc gene under control of its native promoter was used for homologous recombination . the approach generated Δpcbc::pcbc, of which five individual transformants  were tested. the site-specific integration of the pcbc genes was verified by pcr  and southern hybridization . additionally, we generated a penicillin-producing strain  by ectopic integration of a pcbc-egfp fusion construct under control of the constitutive gpd promoter. southern hybridization revealed at least three ectopic integrations of this construct .

our next step was to determine whether the copy number in these strains affected penicillin biosynthesis, so we conducted a halo assay using the indicator bacterium staphylococcus aureus. the size of the halo was measured in relation to the dry weight of the mycelium. most strikingly, no differences were detectable between the reference strain p2niad <dig> and the strain Δpcku <dig>  t17- <dig>  which both harbored two copies of the cluster, and two strains t <dig>  and t1- <dig> , which lack one copy . as expected, disruption of the pcbc gene in ∆pcku <dig>  t1- <dig> yielded a penicillin non-producer , verifying that this strain is indeed single copy with respect to the penicillin biosynthesis gene cluster. complementation of the null mutant with one copy of the pcbc gene under its native promoter resulted in penicillin biosynthesis comparable to the reference strains. additionally, an ectopic integration of at least three copies of a pcbc-egfp fusion construct under control of the constitutive gpd promoter  complemented the penicillin defect of the null mutant to an extent similar to that of the native complementation constructs . for comparison, the titer of the wild type strain nrrl  <dig> is given, which has a titer of about 20% in our plate assays compared with the other penicillin producing strains.fig.  <dig> quantification of penicillin production of strains with different copy numbers of the pcbc gene. the strains were grown for 96 h in shaking cultures. the diameter of each halo was measured to calculate the area and is given in relation to the dry weight of the respective culture. standard deviations were determined from representative isolates, which were measured in triplicate. the copy number of each strain is displayed above the corresponding column. for all strains with a copy number of  <dig> or  <dig>  the number indicates both the copy number of the pcbc gene and the complete cluster. for Δpcbc t7- <dig>  one copy of both pcbab and pende is still present, whereas pcbc is missing. to generate Δpcbc::pcbc-gfp, the Δpcbc recipient was complemented with three ectopic integrations of a pcbc-egfp fusion construct. for comparison, wild type strain nrrl  <dig>  which carries one copy of the penicillin cluster, is given




we then complemented the Δpcbc mutant with plasmid ppcpv <dig>  which carries the complete penicillin biosynthesis cluster of 26 kb, together with the niad gene, thus allowing complementation of the nitrate reductase deficiency of p2niad <dig> and its descendants. after restriction of the chromosomal dna with pmei, followed by pfge, the subsequent southern hybridization with a probe comprising pcbc revealed that this construct integrated in all cases in the genomic area that harbors the native cluster. however, some transformants  showed a single integration of the plasmid whereas t <dig> and t <dig> carried two copies of the plasmid , thus resulting in complementation strains with either one or two intact copies of the cluster. a penicillin bioassay again revealed no significant differences between the complementation strains, independent from the copy number . all four complementation strains even slightly exceeded the penicillin production observed in the reference strain Δpcku <dig>  t1- <dig> fig.  <dig> generation of pcbc complementation strains by complementation with the complete penicillin biosynthesis cluster. the pcbc null mutant was complemented with plasmid ppcpv <dig> harboring the complete biosynthesis cluster . pfge proved that integration of the plasmid occurred in the genomic region of the penicillin cluster and further showed single  or double  integration of the plasmid . the gene content of individual strains is indicated above each lane, for comparison strain Δku <dig>  is given

quantification of the pcbc transcript in deletion and complementation strains, carrying different copies of the penicillin cluster
finally, we tested whether the transcriptional expression level reflects the penicillin titer observed in the recipient and recombinant strains. all strains were grown for 3 days in shaking flasks with rich complete culture medium . this time point represents the early phase of β-lactam production and is characterized by an expressional switch from genes related to vegetative growth to those involved in secondary metabolite formation  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  we quantified the pcbc transcript from three biological replicates in relation to the ssurrna. both pcbc null mutants  gave negative results, and the single copy strain Δpcku <dig>  t <dig> showed an almost zero expression level. the results of the quantitative pcr analysis correspond roughly to the copy number of the pcbc gene. the four independently derived transformants Δpcbc::ppcpv <dig> t1-t <dig> have similar transcript levels although distinct by the copy number of their penicillin gene cluster. this analysis of relative log2-fold expression ratios of the pcbc transcript support our previous results that copy number and thus transcript level have only a minor effect on penicillin titers.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis to quantify the pcbc transcript. rnas, isolated from strains as indicated, were used for quantification. the procedure is described in the material and methods section, with oligonucleotides as listed in table  <dig>  ssurrna served as reference for normalization. the copy number of each strain is displayed above the corresponding column




discussion
the three penicillin biosynthesis genes pcbab, pcbc, and pende are clustered in a single 18-kb region in wild-type strains of the filamentous fungi p. chrysogenum and aspergillus nidulans. previous chromosome separation and dna hybridization analysis showed that production strains from p. chrysogenum have up to  <dig> copies of a  <dig> -kb region carrying further protein coding genes that are not characterized in detail  <cit> . this high copy number was suggested to be relevant for the high penicillin titer observed  <cit> . our analysis, however, indicates that regulatory genes unrelated to the penicillin biosynthesis gene cluster are responsible for increased penicillin production, at least in the p <dig> line of production strains.

theilgaard et al.  <cit>  showed that penicillin production in the low-producing, single gene copy strain wisconsin 54- <dig> could be increased by integration of additional copies of the three penicillin biosynthesis genes. however, for increased titer, all three genes had to be integrated; other combinations with only one or two of the genes did not result in higher penicillin production. the authors proposed that amplification of all three biosynthesis genes is responsible for the high penicillin titer of production strains. more recently, it was found that the amount of penicillin v increases with penicillin biosynthetic gene cluster number but with saturation at high copy numbers. this study was done in industrial strains with a wisconsin 54- <dig> background  <cit> . remarkably, in that study, the protein level of the acyltransferase, the gene product of pende, was saturated already at low cluster copy numbers, suggesting that the acyltransferase reaction presents a bottleneck in the biosynthesis process.

several high-production strains have been described that comprise multiple copies of the penicillin cluster  <cit> . for example, strain as-p- <dig> carries between five and nine copies  <cit> . another strain, bw  <dig>  harbors between  <dig> and  <dig> copies of the cluster  <cit> . the panlabs strain p <dig>  which is also a derivative of q <dig>  was thought to carry between  <dig> and  <dig> copies  <cit> . however, genome analysis and results from our work revealed that at least strain p2niad <dig>  a nitrate reductase–deficient derivative that emerged from p <dig> by conventional mutagenesis, harbors only two copies of the penicillin biosynthesis cluster  <cit> . still, this strain produces high amounts of penicillin, indicating that copy number is not the sole factor in increased production rates. our data strongly support this conclusion, revealing that even the loss of one of the two copies did not result in significantly decreased penicillin biosynthesis. in addition, complementation strains with one or two copies of the cluster yielded no significant differences in titer.

the amplified regions might even be responsible for the genetic instability of strains with multiple copies of the biosynthetic gene clusters. harris et al.  <cit>  described, for example, that after protoplasting, gene clusters are easily lost in industrial strains derived from wisconsin54- <dig>  similar observations were made for the yeast yarrowia lipolytica. to test gene amplification in the rdna of y. lipolytica, several plasmids were transformed into the yeast cells  <cit> . among other elements, these plasmids harbored the reporter gene xpr <dig> encoding alkaline extracellular protease . plasmid copy number was stable for strains containing fewer than  <dig> copies per cell. however, for higher copy numbers, multiple integrations were stable only when aep synthesis was not induced, while in inducing medium, the stability of the multiple integrations was dramatically affected. after aep induction, a reduced growth rate was observed, suggesting that the increased secretory pathway cargo load influenced cell growth.

these data together with our observation that one of two penicillin biosynthesis clusters was randomly lost support the hypothesis that the cluster copies are easily lost and that high-copy strains are unstable. p2niad <dig> is a strain with only two copies but nevertheless capable of high penicillin production, indicating that other factors have an important influence on penicillin biosynthesis.

to date, several regulators of penicillin biosynthesis are already known in filamentous fungi . so far, a pathway specific regulator of the penicillin biosynthesis cluster has not yet been described. in addition to positively acting global regulators like the ph-dependent transcriptional activator pacc and the ccaat binding complex ancf , proteins of the velvet family have become of special interest as repressors in recent years  <cit> . these regulatory proteins play a key role in coordinating secondary metabolism and differentiation processes such as sexual and asexual sporulation in various filamentous fungi . in aspergillus nidulans, vea forms a heterotrimeric complex with velb, another protein of the velvet family, and the global regulator laea under dark conditions to control sexual development and secondary metabolism  <cit> . in addition, velb interacts with vosa, a third velvet-like protein, to form a subcomplex that is essential for asexual and sexual spore formation as well as trehalose biogenesis  <cit> . meanwhile, homologs of velvet components have been identified in numerous other filamentous fungi . recently, we found a rather unexpected regulation of gene expression. the mating type locus encoded mat1-1- <dig> transcription factor is known for its role in sexual identity. however, recent investigations showed a transcriptional control of wide range of genes with biotechnological relevance including those regulating penicillin production. compared with control strains, mutants lacking the mating type locus showed a significant reduction in penicillin biosynthesis throughout a time course  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this report reveals that a high copy number of the three structural genes and an increased pcbc transcript level are not strict prerequisites for increased penicillin production in the production strain penicillium chrysogenum p2niad <dig>  most strikingly, a loss of one of the two identical copies of the cluster did not significantly influence the amount of penicillin produced. these data imply that copy number is not the limiting factor for increased penicillin biosynthesis in the strains investigated and we anticipate that instead, wide domain regulatory factors in trans are involved in this process and are thus important targets for future strain improvement.
