BACKGROUND
new generations of high-speed sequencing instruments in combination with dedicated sample preparation protocols can provide results within a few days. we have developed nanocage to identify each transcript by a single sequencing read  <cit> . the nanocage protocol is most suitable for digital expression profiling with benchtop sequencers as it can use a lower number of reads than any rna-seq method and avoids normalization of read counts over transcript length. including a cap-enrichment step, nanocage focuses on sequencing tags from the 5′ end of mrna that directly indicate expression at defined genomic locations, the transcription start sites , after mapping to a reference genome.

nanocage libraries are prepared in a two-step process comprising a reverse transcription reaction followed by stepwise pcr. during the reverse transcription reaction a template-switching oligonucleotide is added to directly introduce 5′ adapter sequences for pcr and illumina sequencing. further, the 5′ adapter can include different barcodes to facilitate multiplex sequencing  <cit> . the 3′ adapter sequences needed for pcr and illumina sequencing are introduced by the reverse-transcription primers and the later pcr. we prefer the use of random primers to cover also non-polyadenylated transcripts in the libraries.

template-switching allows for cdna preparation from very small rna amounts, where even protocols have been published for the analysis of single-cells  <cit> . however, the selectivity for the cap-dependent enrichment of 5′ ends in mrna can vary: template-switching has been used in cap-specific reactions for the preparation of full-length cdna libraries  <cit>  and 5′ race experiments  <cit> , but also unspecific reactions are possible, for example in the preparation of rna-seq libraries from fragmented rna  <cit> . depending on the intended use of the template-switching reaction, it is therefore very important to find optimal conditions for cap-specific and cap-independent reverse transcription reactions. commonly rna-hybrid oligonucleotides are used in template-switching reactions because they provide cap-selectivity  <cit> . the use of dna oligonucleotides in template-switching reactions has also been reported by  <cit> , but it is hard to draw general conclusions from that work, since, there is no comparison with dna/rna hybrids, and the target rna was prokaryotic, and therefore not capped.

dna/rna hybrids have inherent disadvantages compared to dna oligonucleotides such as their higher price and the intellectual property on their use  <cit> . we therefore investigated alternatives, with the additional goal of increasing the efficiency or the cap specificity of the reaction. here we compare nanocage libraries prepared using dna oligonucleotides as well as rna- and lna-hybrid oligonucleotides in the template-switching reactions. lna  are nucleic acid analogs with a higher dna and rna binding affinity than classical dna oligonucleotides  <cit> . therefore we tested whether lna can mimic rna-like features in template-switching reactions and increase the performance of nanocage library preparation.

RESULTS
three dna-lna hybrid oligonucleotides having  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> lna nucleotide at their 3′ end  were benchmarked with our standard dna-rna hybrid oligonucleotide having  <dig> rna nucleotides at its 3′ end , and a dna oligonucleotide . all oligonucleotides had a ggg-tail at the 3′ end as required for cap-dependent template-switching reactions and different barcodes followed by sequences for pcr and illumina sequencing. besides the different barcodes used in multiplex sequencing, all oligonucleotides used in this study had the same sequence. nanocage libraries were prepared in technical triplicates according to our standard protocol  <cit>  rom the same total rna from rat skeleton muscle. the yields of the first strand cdna synthesis reactions were measured by qpcr  <cit> , where we found reduced cdna yields for all reactions compared to the standard r <dig> template-switching oligonucleotide . therefore we increased the number of semi-suppressive pcr cycles for those nanocage library preparations to obtain the same dna amounts for all libraries . pooled nanocage libraries were combined for multiplex sequencing on an illumina miseq instrument. since the miseq provides a limited number of reads per library , we assessed the results for the miseq run with a reference library made from the same rna sample but deeply sequenced on an illumina hiseq instrument . the fraction of reads aligning to promoters was not significantly different , indicating that the smaller coverage on a miseq is sufficient for nanocage library characterization.

the multiplex miseq sequencing run provided sufficient sequencing reads to map  <cit>  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cage tags to the rat reference genome after discarding reads matching to rrna sequences or resembling oligonucleotide artifacts . we clustered the 5′ ends of the mapped reads into cage transcription start sites and counted them into baskets comprising promoters, exons, introns, and other regions. the number of reads mapped to promoters and exons was compared for each library to confirm the cap-specificity of the template-switching reactions . here we noted that the l <dig> oligonucleotide yielded as many mapped reads hitting gene bodies as the r <dig> oligonucleotide commonly used in template-switching reactions . surprisingly, all the nanocage libraries made by d <dig> and l <dig> showed higher mapping rates to exons than to promoters in contrast to the nanocage libraries made by r <dig> . this may be explained by a stronger tendency of d <dig> and l <dig> to initiate strand invasion, prematurely ending reverse-transcription by hybridizing with complementary regions in the first-strand cdna before it reaches the end of the mrna  <cit>  . within individual loci, we found these strand-invasion artifacts on both strands, creating quantities of antisense signal that does not reflect the transcriptome, especially in the d <dig> libraries . we therefore removed all the clusters that can be explained by strand invasion, using a threshold of two mismatches. visual inspection of filtered data confirmed the general tendency for lower promoter-exon ratios in the d <dig> and l <dig> libraries . l <dig> and l <dig> libraries displayed an intermediate profile when compared to d <dig> and l <dig>  altogether, these observations suggest that only template-switching reactions with rna-dna hybrid oligonucleotides allow for cap enrichment.

next we examined whether all nanocage libraries covered the same set of genes first, we compared the number of different loci detected in each library, after normalizing their sequencing depth to a fixed number of mapped tags by random sampling of  <dig>  tags per library. a similar number of genes were detected in each set of technical triplicates , where the coefficient of variation was never higher than 8%. after pooling the triplicates  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   known loci were identified. second, we intersected the lists of loci and measured that  <dig>  loci were common to all pools. this apparently low overlap is typical in digital expression analysis of samples where the distribution of expression levels is scale-free, because most of the detected loci have low counts, and therefore are likely to be missed even in libraries that are similar by design. to illustrate this, we calculated the number of common loci after replacing the l <dig> and d <dig> pools by random samplings of r <dig> with no replacement, and identified  <dig>  common loci. this indicates similar gene coverage by all the libraries despite the low sequencing depth, and also underlines that even with less than  <dig>  aligned reads, nanocage libraries can cover thousands different loci. given the similar gene coverage of the libraries, we then calculated gene-wise pearson correlation coefficients between the libraries after pooling all the tags aligning to the same gene and obtained correlations ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . lastly, we inspected the significantly over- and under-represented tag clusters in all possible pairwise comparisons of the r <dig>  d <dig> and l <dig> triplicates after removal of the strand-invasion artifacts . using edger , we found that the r <dig> libraries had  <dig> and  <dig> clusters over-represented compared to l <dig> and d <dig> respectively . respectively,  <dig> and 69% of the clusters had a known gene symbol and visual inspection confirmed that they corresponded to 5′ regions. the most significantly enriched clusters in r <dig> compared to l <dig> were signal recognition particle rnas . the same enrichment was also significant, although it did not rank as high, when comparing r <dig> to d <dig>  concomitantly, 7sl rna was also found at significantly higher levels in d <dig> than in l <dig>  this is the main difference between d <dig> and l <dig>  where we found only  <dig> differentially represented clusters in total. visual inspection of the clusters over-represented in d <dig> or l <dig> compared to r <dig> suggest that they are mostly comprised of remaining strand-invasion artifacts that were below the filter’s threshold, or low-complexity regions that were gt-  or ga-rich , which might reflect the sequence of the barcodes used for these libraries. altogether, the overlap and differential representation studies confirm that the main differences between the libraries are the prevalence of strand invasion and the distribution of tags within gene models.

to examine whether the specificity of template-switching is dependent on temperature  <cit> , we varied in the next experiment the temperature of the reverse transcription from  <dig> to 57°c. to further confirm the robustness of our observations across different rna samples, we prepared these libraries from total hela cell rna. high temperatures of  <dig> and 57°c caused the formation of large numbers of oligonucleotide artifacts  with all types of oligonucleotides . the annotation of the aligned reads also indicated that lower temperatures at 37°c or 42°c are preferable for rna and lna mediated template-switching reactions . the experiment confirmed with a human rna source that shifting from rna to lna reduces the promoter rate while increasing the coverage of tags mapping within transcripts regardless of the temperature. we explain the higher number of tags aligning within known regions in this experiment compared with the previous one using rat muscle rna by the better annotation of the human genome in comparison with the rat genome.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the cap-specificity of template-switching reactions depends on the nature of the nucleotides interacting with the first-strand cdna during the template-switching reaction. interestingly, rna nucleotides give the highest cap specificity. while dna/lna duplexes are also expected to be more stable than dna/dna duplexes  <cit>  they showed clearly reduced cap specificity as compared to rna nucleotides. therefore, the binding affinity alone does not explain the cap specificity during template-switching reactions. the yield of template-switched cdnas was also higher with oligonucleotides ending with r <dig> compared with d <dig> and l <dig> . we therefore hypothesize that the rna template-switching oligonucleotides are more efficient with capped templates. a key difference is that capped templates induce the reverse-transcriptase to extend the first-strand cdna with cytosines because it reverse-transcribes the cap  <cit> , while with non-capped templates, extensions are more rare  <cit> , or of a different nature  <cit> . we speculate that only the presence of dna/rna base pairs facilitate template-switching at capped ends, and that dna-dna, dna-lna and dna-rna oligonucleotides have the same efficiency on blunt rna/cdna hybrids. the higher promoter rate with r <dig> would therefore reflect an additional production of template-switched cdnas from capped templates. this dilution of the non-cap-specific signal would also explain the lower proportion of strand invasion in r <dig> 

dna oligonucleotides have the strongest tendency for strand-invasion, found in almost 75% of the alignments, which makes them impractical for cap selection. a careful assessment of the impact of these strand-invasion artifacts would be necessary before using dna oligonucleotides for expression profiling. in addition, a large number of the remaining reads did not align in known genes, resulting in a net loss of usable reads for digital expression analysis and for template-switching-based methods in general. compared to dna-based libraries, rna and lna-based libraries had a deeper coverage over gene bodies, which in the case of lna comprises mostly non-promoter, exonic signal . while no longer providing the promoter/tss specificity of nanocage, lna-mediated template-switching could become an option in the preparation of digital expression libraries or revised versions of rna-seq protocols  <cit> . further work would be needed to assess whether lna-mediated template-switching could be preferable for digital expression profiling starting from partially degraded rna samples, where the cap structure of many transcripts has been lost.
