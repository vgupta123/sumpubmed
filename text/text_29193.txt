BACKGROUND
the orchestration of a successful immune response to infection requires an integrated tissue response coordinated by specific cytokine and chemokine release. pathogen-specific immune responses are coordinated and dependent upon the activation of specific pathogen recognition receptors , molecular moieties present upon sub-sets of leukocytes such as macrophages or dendritic cells. prrs respond to pathogens or their pamps  by the initiation of distinct transcriptomic programmes which will dictate the cellular/tissue response  <cit> . in mammals different transcriptional programmes have been identified by microarray analysis for specific pamps  by both macrophages and dendritic cells which initiate the immune response by secreting molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> .

the availability of salmonid-specific gene chips  <cit>  has provided the means to begin to characterise the salmonid immune response at a global gene level both in vitro and in vivo. this technology will provide a deeper understanding of overall cellular and tissue processes during immune activation. a number of recent reports concerning pamp recognition  <cit> , activated macrophage transcriptomics  <cit>  and immunomics  <cit>  and genome-wide surveys  <cit>  show that fish and fish macrophages clearly respond differentially to different pathogens. this therefore should lead to different physiological/immunological responses in vivo upon which the survival of the organism is based.

the head kidney or anterior kidney located posterior to the cranium, is the central hematopoietic organ in salmonids and other fish species. in addition, it contains adrenalin-producing chromaffin cells and also plays a major endocrine role in secretion of cortisol, the major glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid in fish  <cit> . the head kidney can thus integrate the neuro-immuno-endocrine milieu in normal and pathological states. however, few global gene regulation studies concerning the molecular regulation of head kidney function during infection or pamp stimulation in salmonids  <cit>  have been reported although many studies have used this tissue as a primary source of macrophage-like cells for studies on the activation of the immune system  <cit> .

the novirhabdovirus infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus  is probably one of the most important fish viral pathogens, responsible for great mortalities in farmed salmonids  <cit> . as for all the rhabdoviridae, the genome of ihnv consists of a single-stranded negative-sense rna which has been entirely sequenced  <cit> . their genome codes for five structural proteins: a nucleoprotein , a polymerase-associated protein , a matrix protein , an rna-dependent rna polymerase  and a surface glycoprotein  responsible for immunogenicity  <cit> . an additional gene, only present in some fish rhabdoviruses, located between the g and l genes, encodes a non-structural protein nv, whose putative role in virus replication remains to be fully evaluated  <cit>  but appears to be linked to viral growth and pathogenicity  <cit> . the strong early immune response elicited by ihnv and other related rna viruses has favored the development of several vaccines using a reverse genetics approach  <cit> ; however, recently a dna vaccine against ihn has been registered in canada .

lps, the major constituent of the external layer of the outer layer of gram-negative bacteria, is a widely used pamp-preparation which induces potent immune responses in which the lipid a portion of the molecule is primarily responsible for the endotoxic properties observed in experimental animals  <cit> . fish present a remarkable tolerance to lps challenge in comparison to mammals which has been postulated to be due to differences in receptor-mediated recognition of lps  <cit> . in vivo challenge to high concentrations of lps in fish does not result in endotoxin-mediated mortality  <cit> .

we have carried out in vivo challenges using either live or attenuated ihnv  or bacterial lipopolysaccharide  in trout . total rnas from head kidney tissue were sampled,  <dig> and  <dig> days post intra-peritoneal injection , and analysed by gene chip analysis. we have identified a generalised immune/stress/hematopoietic gene response to all treatments and a large set of viral-specific genes responding to ihnv infection. gene ontology analysis presents two distinct physiological responses to either lps or ihnv in which ihnv pathogenesis can be clearly identified. the response to lps indicates a general inflammatory response followed by a significant hematopoietic response. here we present a comparison of the differential gene expression patterns induced in vivo by a generic pamp, e. coli lps, and a viral pathogen, ihnv, and an attenuated form of the viral pathogen, attihnv in the head kidney of the rainbow trout.

RESULTS
fish survival and pathogenesis
the epizootiology of ihn in young fish has been thoroughly described  <cit>  and includes widespread hemorrhages in kidney, liver and musculature leading to anemia, and extensive necrosis of major hematopioetic tissues . no mortalities, external signs or histological lesions were observed in fish injected with ihnv or attihnv at sampling time points. the remaining or non-sampled fish displayed the referred pathological features of ihn, arriving to a 100% mortality 7– <dig> days and 15– <dig> days after challenge with virulent or attenuated ihnv, respectively. in fish challenged with lps no mortalities were recorded in experimental groups. this is a typical response in which fish do not show an appreciable 'septic shock' type response. a molecular mechanism has been proposed addressing lps-tolerance in fish which may be due to differential signalling from toll-like receptors in which the classical tlr <dig> paradigm differs from that observed in mammals. in fact, rainbow trout macrophages have been shown to be about  <dig> times less sensitive to lps than mammalian macrophages  <cit> .

overview of viral and lps-induced differential gene expression in the head kidney
in order to examine the transcriptional profile of head kidneys  dissected from trout treated with either intra-peritoneal lps or infection with ihnv or attihnv we used a salmonid-specific cdna microarray platform previously validated for studies involving stress, toxicity and immune response in trout  <cit> .

total numbers of genes significantly expressed in each of the treatments is shown in fig.  <dig> and a list of  <dig> selected genes, ranked by the expression levels was included in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  applying a selection criteria based in a classical cut-off value of > <dig> fold change over the differentially expressed genes  emphasizes the stronger global induction of gene expression following the inoculation of both active and attenuated forms of ihnv . within differentially expressed gene groups , bacterial lps induces a higher response in comparison to viral groups. although the number of ranked selected genes  is considerably lower than in viral treatments, about  <dig> %  and 60%  of regulated genes at  <dig> and  <dig> hours respectively achieve more than  <dig> fold change in its expression levels, in contrast with attenuated  or active  viral inoculation of ihnv.

however, using the aforementioned selection criteria  the magnitude of the transcriptomic response, measured as the number of differentially expressed genes, shows a clear difference between active viral treatment and lps, the former eliciting an extensive immune, apoptotic and transcriptional response . as shown by the gene representation of the two viral treatments mirroring strength of induction at 1– <dig>  fold change levels, transcriptomic responses also include an extensive repertoire of genes expressed below  <dig>  fold with p <  <dig>  that clearly outnumber the 2-fold expressed genes  and can be ascribed to low-level transcriptional, metabolic and homeostasis maintenance programs . whilst it may be expected that an attenuated form of the virus does not induce a similar magnitude of response, the species-specific onset of the immune response elicited by the highly antigenic viral glycoprotein  of attihnv may undoubtedly contribute to the observed gene expression pattern, as described in several dna vaccination assays for fish pathogenic rhabdoviruses  <cit> .

not surprisingly, both viral treatments display a 10% increase in the number of genes regulated > <dig> fold at  <dig> hours post-treatment. previous studies on the pathogenicity of ihnv in salmonids typically describe a  <dig> h delay in detectable viral titres and internal measures of immunological disturbance, followed by a rapid increase in the differential expression of viral-related and acute phase response genes in major haematopoietic organs and liver, respectively  <cit> . in addition, a tissue-specific effect determines the dynamics of the transient cellular populations during inflammation and, subsequently, the tissue-dependent gene expression profile. it has been suggested  <cit>  that the transient double stranded rna intermediates produced by the accelerated replication of ihnv  <dig> hours post infection seem to regulate the expression of trout toll-like receptor  <dig>  in a unpredictable manner, strongly dependent on viral growth and host lymphocyte recirculation cycles. interestingly, the pattern of rttlr <dig> expression in response to yersinia ruckeri, a gram-negative bacterial trout pathogen shows a remarkably lower magnitude in terms of fold change compared with the viral challenge  <cit> , mimicking the magnitude of the response between lps and ihnv/attihnv treatments described above . although both treatments display increases in the number of regulated genes the patterns of gene expression are also significantly different. the number of genes regulated show that lps induces in the majority a down-regulation of gene expression at both time points. similar results were observed in lps-stimulated macrophages derived from trout, o. mykiss, analysed with the same platform  <cit> . highest fold changes in individual genes were observed in down-regulated genes in the lps groups . on the other hand, viral treatments induce a higher induction of transcriptomic and cell cycle/apoptotic activity where induction and suppression processes display a similar weighting .

the viral treatments show the highest differential gene expression counts obtained when compared across all available experiments in our gene  database. this observation, together with the extensive transcriptional onset observed in the analysis of functional ontology categories in viral treatments , follows that of abbas et al.  suggesting that a specific immune response mobilizes more transcriptional remodelling than the majority of physiological responses.

specific vs. common gene responses
from the selected differentially expressed genes  in lps and viral treatments, the differential response in lps and viral treatments  was evaluated across  <dig> experiments in our gene database  in order to ascertain those genes co-expressed  in each or both experimental conditions . a total of  <dig> genes were identified from which many genes showed opposite responses representative of directional responses to viral and lps-induced stimuli .

interestingly genes regulated by the attihnv treatment show a mixture of effects both similar and different to lps and ihnv suggesting that different mechanisms, non-specific and specific response, of activation are induced by the attenuated virus in the head kidney. alpha globin for example shows down regulation by lps whereas attihnv initially induces expression,  <dig> fold, followed by suppression, - <dig>  fold. on the other hand ihnv causes suppression at  <dig> hours followed by strong induction,  <dig> fold. lps and attihnv show similar profiles for: glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, annexin  <dig>  the nephrosin proteins, calmodulin- <dig>  cebp-beta, cysteine-rich protein- <dig>  cytochrome oxidase and cytochrome p- <dig>  the majority of the genes are related to immunity and the inflammatory response. suppression of hk proteases, nephrosin and mmps, seems to be one of the most characteristic effects of lps  whereas viral treatment causes a similar initial effect followed by induction of expression . serine protease-like proteins  <dig> and  <dig> are also highly suppressed by lps, attihnv and ihnv at  <dig> hours. this suppression continues in the lps treatment, however in viral samples we observe a significant increase in expression in the  <dig> hour samples . several cytoskeleton related genes including arp2/ <dig>  the actin and profilin- <dig> are down-regulated by both lps and attihnv whereas ihnv induces up-regulation of all genes in this group at  <dig> hours post-infection.

viral treatments induce a typical adaptive immune response . the antigen processing/presenting loading pathways include the differential expression of mhc class i and lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages, as shown by the regulation of b-cell specific coactivator obf- <dig>  essential for the response of b-cells to antigens and required for the formation of germinal centers, the conservation of btk b-cell, hck neutrophil and tnfalpha receptor signaling pathways, the cathepsin mediated antigen processing and the interferon-inducible rna-specific adenosine deaminase adar <dig> .

not surprisingly, nf-kappa-b  signal transduction suffered from moderate to severe regulation in the head kidney of infected trout . nfkb is considered a pleiotropic transcription factor expressed in several cell types undergoing amongst others inflammatory assaults. both active ihnv and attihnv treated fish showed differential regulation of inhibitor of kappab kinase gamma, member of a family of proteins which inactivate nfkb by trapping it in the cell cytoplasm  <cit>  and are actively expressed in virus infected cells  <cit> .

the anaphylactic arm of the complement activation acts in a double fashion through the component c3a/c3areceptor: as a chemotactic mediator involved in endotoxic responses and, simultaneously, as a regulator of homing and mobilizations of hematopoietic stem cells . both complement related serine proteases  and c <dig> proteolytic components were differentially expressed in lps-induced or viral treatments. however, the highest levels of complement expression seem to be strongly dependent of viral invasions in fish head kidney 

stromal protease activity and extracellular matrix remodelling in trout head kidney
although the precise function of nephrosin, an astacin metalloproteinase  <cit>  remains unresolved, it has been shown to be involved in the late stages of granulocyte differentiation and cell migration and/or tissue infiltration processes in challenged carp and zebrafish  <cit> . in trout treated with lps, the two nephrosin proteins genes are severely down regulated  at both time points . the rest of metalloproteinases  also showed a marked decrease of expression in lps treated trout  at both time points and at  <dig> h in ihnv or attihnv infected fish , therefore suggesting a decrease in extracellular matrix remodeling and leukocyte movement.

in mammals, mmp  <dig> has been implicated in the signal processing and maturation of dendritic cells, il- <dig> mediated activation of neutrophils and undifferentiated hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . whilst the existence of functionally differentiated dendritic cells in fish is still controversial  <cit> , the mammalian leukocyte response outlined for il- <dig> and mmp  <dig> seems to be conserved in teleosts, although the exact pattern of organ distribution, the intensity of gene regulation and the voluble species-specific expression of il- <dig> in fish hk remains obscure  <cit> . the chemotatic properties of il- <dig> on leukocytes are amplified by the recruitment of neutrophils mediated by cxc chemokines. our data show a moderate  down-regulation of trout cxcr <dig>  mammalian cxcr <dig> forms with tnfalpha, several hsp proteins and gdf <dig> an activation cluster involved in monocyte lps signal transduction  <cit>  and also acts synergistically with the colony-stimulating factor mediated mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> .

the mmp gene family appears to be induced by lps in trout macrophages  <cit> , and a widescreen transcriptomic analysis of carp metalloproteinases detected a large amount of mmp <dig> mrna mainly in hematopoietic organs, hk and spleen  <cit> . fish metalloproteinases thus probably act in a mammalian fashion, showing and up-regulation by the synergistic stimulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha  and lps. in agreement with the low level expression of mmps observed  <dig> h post injection, no significant amounts of tnfalpha mrna were detected in lps treated trout, in contrast with ihnv infected fish. both myeloperoxidase, a lysosomal hemoprotein characteristic of mononuclear phagocytes, and tnf were up regulated  <dig> h post injection of attenuated ihnv in trout hk . in the active viral group, however, tnfalpha was found to be inactive . the moderate up-regulation of tnfalpha  <dig> days post attihnv stimulation  may suggest, according to the well described model of macrophage stimulation by lps  <cit> , the onset of a proliferative myeloid response in the principal hematopoietic organ.

intracellular thymosin beta- <dig>  is considered the main g-actin sequestering peptide in mammals  <cit> . the putative functions of extracellular tb4x include induction of hemostasis, wound and tissue healing, chemotaxis, induction of metalloproteinases, granulocyte-mediated inhibition of inflammatory processes and regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation  <cit> . not surprisingly, the tbx <dig> gene is > <dig> fold down regulated in trout hk  <dig> h post injection of lps , but strongly upregulated  in ihnv infected trout undergoing an incipient hemorrhagic symptomology. this suggests that, in fish as in mammals, the pleiotropic effects of tbx <dig> are mediated by the remodeling of intracellular actin cytoskeleton and/or components of the extracellular matrix  <cit> .

the moderate/severe down-regulation of cxcr <dig>  <dig> day post lps challenge , metalloproteinases and tb4x observed at  <dig> h and  <dig> h  thus favors a scenario of delayed reactive state to lps stimulation in the recirculation and traffic of trout head kidney hematopoietic cells following i.p. administration of bacterial lps. moreover, the head kidney itself shows a low level stromal extracellular matrix remodeling in trout treated with lps, as suggested by the down regulated expression of actin, mmp, nephrosins and thymosin beta  <dig> . however, at  <dig> days post ihnv infection the transcriptomic footprints in the head kidney reveal an immunological shift orientated toward a somewhat impaired adaptive arm activation coupled with a strong hemostatic and extracellular matrix sculpting response: the systemic spreading of ihnv clearly inhibits tnfalpha, mhc class i and several macrophage and cell cycle/differentiation markers  favoring a mhc class ii, immunoglobulin and mmp/tbx <dig> enhanced immune response.

complement response to lps-induced and viral challenges in trout head kidney
contrary to the liver, the head kidney cannot be considered an acute phase reactive organ. following a xenobiotic assault, complement related serine proteases, modulators and c <dig> proteolytic peptides are synthesized primarily in the liver. however, minor but biologically significant extra-hepatic  synthesis of complement components has recently been demonstrated in fish as in other vertebrates  <cit> . therefore, complement inflammatory, chemotactic, opsonic and lytic activities extend the effect of the innate arm of immune responses to the core of major hematopoietic organs.

in trout injected with lps, complement related serine proteases  homologous to the masp proteins involved in the activation of the classical complement pathway  <cit>  remained down regulated throughout the treatment  and no expression of c <dig> genes were detectable in head kidney , in concordance with the biased adaptive response observed in this group . a recent microarray analysis of acute phase reactivity in the liver of catfish  showed an enhanced  complement response in fish infected with edwardsiella ictaluri, a gram negative pathogen responsible for enteric septicemia in catfish  <cit>  in trout, lovoll et al.  found a similar expression pattern in hepatocytes treated with lps, but, in sharp contrast with the highest expression levels of complement genes in liver, a minor up regulation of c <dig> genes in head kidney and spleen was observed. additionally, gene expression showed a strong tissue and isoform dependence: c3- <dig> was found to be down regulated in hk following stimulation with lps, and more interestingly, not all trout isoforms maintained similar levels of gene expression  <cit> .

the tolerance of fish to the standard lps doses used in rodent immune challenges is well known, and has been linked to the peculiarities of pamp receptors in fish  <cit>  that may preclude a strong endotoxic shock response. thus, the strongest cellular and tissue responses to i.p. injection lps in fish are thought to be restricted to activated monocyte/macrophages and lymphocytes, portals of entry  and acute phase organs . however, the dynamics of the teleostean immune response is of primary interest in these organs, as in the head kidney, that functions either as a cradle for immunological priming of leukocyte populations or as a major node in the complex and the still poorly understood network of neuro-immune-endocrine interactions in fish. in that respect, our results uncover a striking difference between lipopolysaccharide and viral treatments concerning head kidney transcriptomic dynamics: in attenuated and active ihnv groups, the complement related serine proteases and anaphylatoxin receptors  maintain up regulated expression levels at both time points, with the maximal expression  in active viral groups.

the c3ar shows an unequivocal upregulated expression at  <dig> h and  <dig> h in animals infected with attihnv, and at  <dig> h in animals infected with active ihnv  in ihnv treated fish at  <dig> h; see additional file 1). at  <dig> h, the response to ihnv consist of a mixture of adaptive  and innate  immune and stress  responses against a background of metalloproteinase-mediated matrix remodeling . therefore, as suggested in this and previous studies with mammals  <cit> , the expression of c3a/c3ar may probably contribute to the homing/mobilizations and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in response to the generalized immune and stress response elicited by an aggressive and extremely pathogenic virus in fish. moreover, in mammals several c <dig> cleavage fragments, including c3a has been demonstrated to be linked to the cxcr4-mediated responsiveness of hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . the moderate down regulation of cxcr <dig> in lps treated fish  and upregulation  in attihnv infected fish , together with the strong upregulation of c3ar in ihnv treated fish suggests a conservation of complement mediated functional responses in the hematopoietic head kidney. the dynamics and trafficking of hematopoietic and differentiated cells in fish are, nonetheless, far from being fully understood.

specific immune responses to lps-induced and viral challenges in trout head kidney
genes involved in the immunoglobulin system increased in all treatments displaying different kinetics. ig gamma fc receptor  gene expression increased late in the lps treatment whereas igm heavy chain  and ig kappa chain v-iv region b17- <dig>  increased acutely. under attihnv conditions a similar regulation is observed for the latter genes in which igm expression is sustained at  <dig> hours and ig kappa suppressed. cd <dig> expression is suppressed by attenuated virus, whereas ihnv suppresses all three genes at the early stage and induces expression  at the later stage of infection. this may reflect migration of leukocytes to the primary sites of infection/inflammation and/or differential recruitment of leukocyte sub-populations to the infected head kidney in both ihnv/attihnv treatments.

the coatomer protein  epsilon known to play a role in the formation and maturation of phagosomes  <cit>  is induced in all treatments, and the class i major histocompatibility complex  antigen, well known to be involved in antigen presentation in dendritic cells is activated late by lps and suppressed by viral treatments , whereas class ii mhc showed a moderate up regulation  in fish infected with ihnv at  <dig> h.

in fish, as in mammals, the interaction of mhc molecules with t cell receptors  seems to activate subsets of cytotoxic t lymphocytes  and t helper cells  in a similar fashion  <cit> . homologues of mammalian mhc, several proteins associated to antigen presentation, beta <dig> microglobulin and cd8+ and cd4+  have been recently characterized in trout and other fish species  <cit> , thus reinforcing the conservation of antigen processing pathways in immune cells. however, the trafficking, recirculation and cell-to-cell communication against a quiescent/activated immune background have not yet been properly described in fish. moreover, the translation of classical bacterial or viral inflammatory murine models encompasses several technical  and species-specific difficulties, the latter related to the high variability of the interspecific thresholds of immune activation in fish and, last but not least, the relative virulence and co-evolutionary trade-offs of pathogens.

our and several recent studies have attempted to resolve these issues weighting the organ related immune response to an established model of lps-induced inflammation or viral infection. in this regard, the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig>  in trout seems to be restricted mainly to thymus and to a certain extent, to spleen, even though non-infected fish maintain a widespread low level expression in several hematopoietic or lymphocyte infiltrated organs  <cit> . overturf and lapatra  were unable to find elevated levels of cd <dig> expression in the hk of trout infected with bacteria or ihnv at  <dig> h or  <dig> days post infection, although in liver and spleen a positive dose-response correlation followed the infection  expression of cd <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> . in a similar experiment,  <dig> hours after ihnv challenge hansen and lapatra  observed a surprising tissue-specific shutdown of mhc class iib mrna in head kidney and spleen of infected trout, thus suggesting an enhanced cd <dig> response coupled with activation of mhc class i antigen presentation following ihnv infection  <cit> , as observed in a cohabitant model of fish viral infection described recently  <cit> . similarly, an infection by vibrio anguilarum seemed to depress the short term  expression of mhc class ii genes in head kidney, liver and spleen of turbot, scophthalmus maximus  <cit> . however, an elevated expression of mhc class ii genes has been described in trout following i.m. dna vaccination with recombinant ihnv  <cit>  and xenobiotic inflammation  <cit> . in trout challenged with vshv, a member of rhabdoviridae, the dynamics of t cell expansion, and thus the onset of mhc mediated adaptive immune response, were found to be correlated with the expected waves of viral replication, with peak a week after viral challenge  <cit> , mimicking the delayed  expression of mhc mrnas that were also observed in japanese flounder  leukocytes infected with neoheterobothrium hirame, a monogenean parasite  <cit> .

as described in other species  <cit> , our results suggest a predilection for cd4/th lymphocyte response in the head kidney of trout challenged with ihnv at  <dig> post infection, coupled with a strong spl-induced complement cleavage activation and mmp/tbx <dig> extracellular matrix sculpting, together with a decreased tnfalpha mediated activation of monocyte/macrophage populations, a shutdown of mhc class i and also a low level regulation of apoptosis, as shown by the inhibition of ubiquitin ligase s1ah <dig> and galectin- <dig> .

the i.p. administration of lps activates the mhc class i pathway of antigen processing in concordance with previous studies with lps-activated trout macrophages  <cit> . however, the transcription factor ccaat/enhancer binding protein-alpha , best known for its role in driving myeloid cells towards the granulocytic line  <cit>  but also known to be induced during macrophage differentiation, and the mmp/tbx <dig> response was inhibited in head kidney  <dig> h post injection. deltex protein  <dig>  also appears to be down regulated  <dig> h post infection with lps . although still poorly understood, the cross-talk between deltex protein  <dig>  and the evolutionary conserved notch and nfkappab signaling pathways  <cit>  allows the normal development and maturation of differentiated lymphocyte populations in hematopoietic and lymphopoietic organs in mammals. this suggests an impaired trafficking of lymphoid/myeloid hk cells in the early response to lps in trout.

myeloperoxidase  was up-regulated by all treatments at  <dig> hours returning to baseline in lps samples, increasing in attihnv and actively inhibited in ihnv samples . myeloperoxidase is expressed in neutrophils and monocytes and plays a role in the oxygen dependent mechanism of phagocytosis. the macrophage scavenger receptor marco  <cit>  was also inhibited in ihnv samples. therefore, the microbiocidal function was diminished in the head kidney of ihnv infected trout.

taken together, these results may suggest a minor function of the head kidney in the short term  activation of the immune response to virulent ihnv, or, alternatively, an inducible and maybe antagonistic early differential expression of mhc class i or ii mediated antigen processing in the head kidney, heavily influenced either by the type and infective dynamics of pathogen  or the portals of entry . from the experimental infections described above, the liver and spleen also seem to act as a major acute phase reactive organs at the initial stages of viral invasion, and the head kidney can be more properly defined as an inductor of a delayed adaptive response as much as a major regulator of erythropoietic and myeloid differentiation. nevertheless the dual expression of the mhc antigen processing/presenting machinery appears to be strongly influenced by the species-specific immunological sensibility  <cit> , the virulence of pathogens and the timing of cellular differentiation in immune organs. this pathogen/host species-specific branching of mhc mediated immune response in fish requires, however, further analysis.

haemoglobin metabolism in lps-induced and viral infected trout head kidney
hemoglobin genes  are suppressed by both lps and ihnv at  <dig> hours, 2– <dig> fold suppression, however attihnv strongly induces expression of both proteins followed by suppression at  <dig> hours. ihnv induces expression  at  <dig> hours whereas lps samples return to baseline levels.

interestingly, 5-aminolevulinate synthase, the key enzyme involved in heme synthesis was up-regulated in both attihnv samples and in a lps-specific manner at  <dig> hours. a similar response has been observed in head kidney tissue from atlantic salmon, s. salar, infected with piscirickettsia  <cit> .

the coordinated expression of both hemoglobin genes and 5-aminolevulinate synthase suggest erythropoietic activity in the head kidney. furthermore, a significant increase in cellular proliferation in pu-1-ve cells,  <dig> hours post-lps administration, in the head kidney of lps-treated rainbow trout has been reported  thus activation of hematopoietic, potentially erythropoietic, mechanisms during the early stages of infectious processes may be a standard for the non-specific immune response in fish.

hsp induced stress response to lps-induced and viral challenges in trout head kidney
active ihnv inhibits the expression of heat shock protein   <dig>  and induces the expression of  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> days post infection from a previous inactive state at  <dig> h . the attihnv showed a down regulation of hsp <dig>  at the same time point.

hsps have been implicated in the generalized stress response associated to xenobiotics and/or inflammatory reactions in fish  <cit> . however, the reliability of hsp as an indicator of stress or pathologic/immune disturbances has recently thoroughly criticized  <cit>  because of the great variability of measured hsp expression: despite the correlated expression of hsp with altered states in stressed or injured fish, the sensitivity and intensity of hsp response can vary in a species-specific manner, and among tissues, hsp families, season, developmental stages and stressor. not being an acute phase response organ, it is, thus, difficult to speculate about the fate of hsp repaired enzymatic and/or cytoskeleton proteins in infected head kidney.

CONCLUSIONS
for the functional analysis of biological roles of regulated genes, our two-step approach in the first instance establishes a list of differentially expressed genes whose ascribed biological roles are evaluated and secondly by identifying overrepresented go functional categories using the kuopiochip analysis software . this methodological approach is not exempt of limitations. the selected cut-offs for minimal gene expression, the co-expressed patterns of gene expression, the non lineal genome-proteome crosstalk and the limited transcript enrichment of the array can either limit the amount and quality of transcriptomic responses assessed or exclude transient but biologically relevant genetic responses correlated with the abruptness and organ-dependent systemic damage in infected fish.

as a guideline for elucidating the biological response of viral/lps-induced challenge, the comparison of differentially expressed genes by the go categories showed a marked induction of metalloproteinases and other collagen and extracellular matrix sculptors in lps treated trout, coupled with a decrease in genes controlling the basal metabolism and an increase in the activity of immune related mediators of mhc antigen presenting and immunoglublin-mediated opsonisation   <dig> h post infection.

several genes involved in signal transduction and protein biosynthesis were active in attihnv groups  <dig> h post infection, following a decrease in cytoskeleton remodelling. as in active ihnv infected trout, the functional go categories are strongly enriched in genes active during inflammatory, immune and defence responses. in both attenuated and active ihnv treated fish, the immune response at  <dig> h clearly outweighs the metalloproteinase orientated lps response, but, as described above, the response of the trout head kidney transcriptome to ihnv infection was more robust and diversified in number and immune related activation pathways.
