BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is an opportunistic, gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming pathogen found in the environment and in the intestinal flora in up to 3% of healthy adults. toxigenic strains of c. difficile are resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics and produce the enterotoxin tcda and the cytotoxin tcdb. these toxins are responsible for the clinical symptoms of c. difficile infection   <cit> . cdi is the leading cause of hospital-borne infections occurring when the natural intestinal flora is depleted following antibiotic treatment. cdi is the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is responsible for pseudomembranous colitis, a form of severe intestinal inflammation. for the most part, cdi can still be treated with metronidazole or vancomycin for which resistance levels remain low or the recently approved fidaxomicin. single or multiple relapses after initial treatment are common and bring about more severe symptoms. a recent clinical study reports a relapse rate of 24% and 13% with vancomycin or fidaxomicin treatment respectively  <cit> . between 50% and 80% of recurrences are due to spore-mediated re-infection  <cit> . unfortunately, patient-to-patient transmission and relapses are difficult to prevent due to the production of c. difficile spores that are resistant to antibiotics, heat, radiation and various chemicals.

cdi is directly responsible for an average  <dig>  per  <dig> patients admitted in hospitals with a  <dig> % mortality rate after 30 days directly attributed to cdi  <cit> . in the us, over  <dig>  cases are registered per year in hospitals alone and many more cases in outpatient settings  <cit> , costing around usd$ <dig>  to usd$ <dig>  per case of primary infection and usd$ <dig>  to usd$ <dig>  per relapsing infection  <cit>  leading to a burden of over usd$ <dig> million  <cit> . more important than economic costs, cdi in older patients, those with concurrent debilitating conditions, and severely relapsing or fulminant cases may result in death.

in recent years there has been an increase in the rate of infections as well as the emergence of community-associated, virulent and antibiotic-resistant strains  <cit> . treatments of cdi that offer alternatives to the use of small-molecules  <cit>  involving phages  <cit>  or intestinal microbial flora transplants  <cit>  are likely to meet resistance from patients. others involving antibodies  <cit>  or vaccines  <cit>  are still under development.

the complexity inherent to preventing and treating cdi requires the continuous search for new ways to target c. difficile. in recent year, the growth of biological databases led to the development of the field of systems biology making it possible to build and analyze genomic-scale reconstructed metabolic networks  <cit> . there is a large number of highly curated reconstructed metabolic networks for a number of organisms, from e. coli  <cit>  to human  <cit> . the prediction of essential genes is often used to detect potential drug targets  <cit> . two techniques, flux balance analysis   <cit>  and synthetic accessibility   <cit>  are among those available to predict essential genes at a genomic scale through in silico gene deletion studies. the comparison of results obtained with either fba or sa and experimentally determined essential genes shows equivalent levels of accuracy with either technique around 94% for b. subtilis  <cit> , 83% for s. cerevisiae and 60-70% for e. coli  <cit> . the success rates are likely reflecting the quality of the metabolic network reconstructions.

the combination of systems pharmacology and metabolic network analyses can help predict off-target effects of drugs as well as open new opportunities with the repositioning of existing drugs  <cit> . in the present study we create and validate a highly curated metabolic network reconstruction for the pathogenic c. difficile strain  <dig>  we then utilize it to predict essential genes or gene pairs. we employ a combination of systems biology, bioinformatics and structural computational biology methods to detect potential human cross-reactivity targets for and detect small-molecules, including existing approved drugs that may bind a number of the predicted c. difficile targets.

RESULTS
creation of the network
the genome of c. difficile strain  <dig> is composed of a circular chromosome of  <dig> ,252 bp coding for  <dig> open reading frames  as well as a plasmid of 7881 bp coding for  <dig> orfs  <cit> . the c. difficile strain  <dig> draft reconstructed metabolic network presented here covers  <dig> % of the orfs present in the chromosomal genome of the bacteria with  <dig> orfs. these  <dig> genes code for proteins catalyzing  <dig> metabolic,  <dig> transport and  <dig> exchange reactions. a total of  <dig> unique metabolites  are involved in the  <dig> reactions in the network. the coverage of the genome is similar to those of previously published reconstructed metabolic networks such as b. subtilis with 20%  <cit>  and higher than the most recent network of c. acetobutylicum with  <dig> %  <cit> . most reactions have at least one gene association . reactions without any gene association were added based on the existence of evidence from the literature such as in the case of stickland reactions  <cit> , presence in databases such as xanthine amido hydrase or to fill functional gaps to obtain a functional network as in the case of putative transporters for end-products of fermentation.

the final version of the network is available in  <dig> different formats:  <dig>  an excel file that shows on different spreadsheets the reactions, metabolites, genes, and compartments that comprise the network and the definitions of the network based on the standard described in the raven toolbox  <cit> . this file is meant to be easily readable by humans;  <dig>  a tab-separated format of the network amenable to analysis in the r statistical computing environment  using sybil  <cit> ; and lastly,  <dig>  a sbml level  <dig> formatted network  <cit>  that can be used with tools such as matlab or other sbml compliant software. while a naming convention has been suggested recently for metabolic reconstructions  <cit> , we feel that a naming convention that does not allude to the name of the organism is insufficient. therefore, in the present work, the c. difficile strain  <dig> metabolic network reconstruction is called imltc806cdf as per the suggested convention with the added cdf suffix denoting the kegg  <cit>  three-letter organism id representing c. difficile strain  <dig>  the sbml version of the model has been deposited to the biomodels database  <cit>  and assigned the identifier model <dig> .

validation
four types of growth media were simulated in silico via modulation of the exchange reactions for the import of metabolites present in the simulated growth media. all four tested media  produced biomass based on fba and sa analysis  <cit> . for sa,  <dig> proteins  that cannot be produced due to the absence of protein biosynthesis reactions in the network but at equilibrium in fba had to be supplemented to the media to make all reactions possible in fba also accessible in sa. atp and nicotinate were supplemented to the minimal medium to allow biomass production in sa while atp was added to the complex medium.table  <dig>

ethe following metabolites or proteins are added in sa analysis to permit the production of biomass: atp, nicotinate, oxidized ferredoxin, oxidized thioredoxin, acyl and sulfur carrier proteins and are present in unchanging equilibrium concentrations in fba.



essential metabolites
in order to validate the network, experiments involving the removal or addition of certain metabolites from the media were reproduced in silico. each essential amino acid  was confirmed essential in the network as their removal prevented the production of biomass in any medium. none of the three essential vitamins are essential in the network . the essentiality of two of these, biotin and pyridoxine, is due to their implication in the regulation of processes which could not be simulated in the metabolic network. panthothenate  was in the past determined to be essential for a number of c. difficile strains tested  <cit> . more recently, a new ketopantoate reductase  gene pang was discovered in a number of pathogenic bacteria and found to have a homolog in c. difficile strain  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, whereas panthothenate is commonly thought to be essential, this essentiality is strain specific and absent in c. difficile strain  <dig>  a Δpang mutant in francisella tularensis did not have any differences compared to wild type infections in a mouse model for pneumonic tularemia  <cit> . this is likely due to the fact that panthothenate  is widely available in food and most bacteria are able to import panthothenate through a sodium co-transport mechanism  <cit> .

non-essential metabolites
removal of non-essential metabolites did not have an important effect on growth. the non-essential amino acid methionine is known to enhance growth of the bacteria and is used in the minimal medium to increase growth rate. interestingly, the removal of methionine from the minimal medium leads to a slight reduction in biomass production , a small but qualitatively correct effect. we simulated the removal of arginine and histidine  from the rich medium and in both cases this lead to the qualitatively correct result of a decrease in biomass production in agreement with the experimental evidence  <cit> . most  non-essential amino acids that when removed from a complete media do not affect growth rate experimentally also have no effect in silico when removed from the complex medium. furthermore, the addition of certain non-essential amino acids  or any nucleosides to the minimal medium leads to an augmentation of biomass production in agreement with experimental data .

carbon sources
the utilisation of different carbon sources in the absence of glucose in the network was simulated and compared to experimental data. such data is not always specific to c. difficile strain  <dig> and small differences among strains do exist  <cit>  . the removal of glucose produced the largest decrease in biomass production  but had a smaller effect in the complex medium . for  <dig> experimentally tested carbon sources  we obtain 100% agreement between the predicted utilization of alternative carbon sources by c. difficile, including the impossibility to use lactose as a carbon source. furthermore, we predict that c. difficile strain  <dig> should not be able to use rhamnose or myo-inositol  while malate, glycerol and chorismate would lead to increased growth rates.

comparison with existing metabolic network reconstructions
we compared imltc806cdf to the recently created automatically-generated non-curated reconstructed metabolic network of c. difficile  <cit> . the automated network contains  <dig> reactions,  <dig> unique metabolites and  <dig> genes resulting in over  <dig> genes/reactions associations. one fundamental requirement for a reconstructed metabolic network is its ability to produce biomass. as noted by its creators, the automatic network cannot produce biomass. this is likely due to the numerous flaws present in the automated network that are absent or present in a lesser number in the curated imltc806cdf reconstruction presented here. among these: generic metabolites, incorrect reaction stoichiometry, repetitions, unclear reactions, dead-end metabolites and non-metabolic genes and reactions. for example, the automated network contains  <dig> generic metabolites representing  <dig> % of the metabolome opposed to  <dig> in imltc806cdf . curiously the automated network reconstruction contains  <dig> reactions involving oxygen, which should not be present in an anaerobic organism. other important flaws in the automatically generated c. difficile network include the presence of  <dig> export reactions and  <dig> dead-end metabolites. overall,  <dig> reactions  are common to both reconstructions out of  <dig> present in the automatically generated network. a detailed comparison is presented in table  <dig>  and clearly shows the vast differences between the two models and that a large number of problems associated to the automatically generated network are absent in imltc806cdf.table  <dig>

we also compared imltc806cdf to a curated metabolic network reconstruction of the closely related bacterium clostridium acetobutylicum. three curated metabolic networks exist for this organism  <cit>  all focusing on metabolic engineering of the bacteria to maximize the production of butanol. the latest network  <cit> , called icac <dig>  was chosen for the comparative analysis as it was the largest, the most recent and the only one available in a commonly accepted usable format . the analysis of reactions shared between the two reconstructions was possible due to the extensive use of kegg identifiers in both networks. in the case of transport reactions, two transporters were considered similar if they transported the same molecule with one transporter from one network potentially matching multiple transporters in the other network. we did not differentiate between phosphoenolpyruvate :carbohydrate phosphotransferase system   <cit> , ion channels  <cit>  or atp driven transporters  <cit>  as long as the transported molecules were the same in the two networks. imltc806cdf contains  <dig> more reactions than the reconstructed network of c. acetobutylicum and  <dig> in common with it . imltc806cdf has  <dig> less unique metabolites and  <dig> metabolites in common . the presence of  <dig>  dead-end metabolites  suggests that the c. acetobutylicum network still has incomplete pathways and gaps that could affect biomass production. a detailed comparison is presented in table  <dig> or in the form of a venn diagram in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

single gene deletions
we performed an in silico gene deletion study using both synthetic accessibility  and flux balance analysis  on imltc806cdf in order to identify potential essential genes that may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. this analysis removed reactions that were catalyzed by each gene alone  or by a complex that involved that gene product and then measured the capacity of the network to produce biomass . the complex medium  was the one used for the gene deletion studies since it reproduces the high concentration and diversity of nutriments found in the intestinal tract. furthermore, the medium used is the same as the simulation of the bacillus subtilis metabolic network  <cit> , which in turn is an approximation of the one used to perform the experimental validation of lethality of single gene deletions in that organism  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> genes deletions were identified via fba analysis as deleterious based on a 5% variation threshold  <cit> . an additional  <dig> genes were found by sa to increase the number of reactions necessary to produce biomass and deemed essential based on this criterion. overall,  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted essentials genes are essential according to both fba and sa . we observe an agreement rate of  <dig> % between the two techniques in terms of the prediction of both lethal and non-lethal genes, which is similar to what was found when comparing both techniques on e. coli and s. cerevisiae  <cit> . since the two techniques provide different insights on the metabolism and characteristics of the network , we consider genes identified as essential by either of these techniques as relevant as those identified by both.table  <dig>

essential genes were compared to experimental results for the gram-positive bacteria bacillus subtilis  <cit> , which is the closest relative of clostridium difficile with experimental essentiality data for all of its genes. since the simulation involved the deletion of genes via deletion of metabolic reactions, functional homologs  were used for the comparison. among the  <dig> genes with a predicted effect on biomass production in c. difficile,  <dig> have homologs that are essential in b. subtilis,  <dig> did not have any functional homolog and  <dig> had a homolog that was not essential in b. subtilis . we were able to compare  <dig> c. difficile genes  for which we could detect a b. subtilis functional homolog with an overall prediction accuracy of  <dig> % . a similar rate of  <dig> % was obtained based on the comparison of  <dig> genes using sequence homology . while an accuracy of around 89% is extremely high, it is important to keep in mind that despite being closely related, differences are expected between the b. subtilis and c. difficile.

we utilized icac <dig> to perform the prediction of essential genes in c. acetobutylicum and compared the results to those above for c. difficile. essential genes in the c. acetobutylicum network were identified in a similar manner than in imltc806cdf, using sybil  <cit>  within the r environment for statistical computing. of the  <dig> c. difficile proteins with c. acetobutylicum sequence homologs,  <dig> are present in icac <dig>  based on these  <dig> proteins, we obtain an agreement of  <dig> % between imltc806cdf icac <dig> . it is interesting to note that we obtain a higher agreement between our computational results for c. difficile and experimental results for b. subtilis than with computational results for icac <dig> representing a more closely related species.

the difficulty of performing genetic manipulations in c. difficile is notorious and severely restricts our ability to compare our results with experimental information. despite the lack of extensive information on experimentally verified essential genes, the little evidence that exists, supports our predicted essential roles for a number of genes: metk  <cit> , guaa  <cit>  and ntpa-b-c-d-e-f-k  <cit> . other known essential genes such as seca1-a <dig>  <cit> , metg and gyra-b  <cit> , trps  <cit>  and glda  <cit>  are not present in the network and are involved in non-metabolic processes. lastly, the gene prdf has been mutated and was shown to be non-essential  <cit> , in agreement with its predicted non-essential role in imltc806cdf.

we compared the list of  <dig> genes predicted to be essential in c. difficile using imltc806cdf to the genes in the database of essential genes   <cit> . interestingly, and serving as further validation of imltc806cdf, a total of  <dig> of these genes are present in deg, i.e., these genes have homologs known to be essential in other species. the remaining  <dig> predicted essential genes that are not present in deg  include ntpa,d,e,f,k  as well as metf  and xpt  among others .

the inhibition of the product of essential genes that are upregulated during cdi may require a smaller drug dose to generate an effective response, thus decreasing side effects. we utilized transcriptomics data associated to the differential expression of genes during infection  <cit>  to annotate predicted essential genes in view of their potential use as therapeutic targets. eight predicted essential genes are downregulated in vivo while  <dig> are upregulated during infection. some of the genes that are upregulated during infection and predicted to be essential such as fabd, sera or cd <dig>  are of additional interest as they could not only affect growth, but also colonisation and pathogenesis processes  <cit>  .

detection of potential human cross-reactivity targets
sequence and functional similarities
one of the main goals in detecting essential genes is to assess their potential as therapeutic targets. one factor weighting in favour of a potential therapeutic target is the lack of a human homolog, as this decreases the chances of side effects of a potential drug off-targeting the gene product of the human homolog. we again utilize here two definitions of homology, the standard sequence homology that relates two genes through evolution and functional homology, which relates two genes via common function of their gene products, specifically the same e.c. number. functional homology is stricter than sequence homology as it is not based on any level of similarity between the two proteins, only based on the fact that the two enzymes catalyze the same reaction. fifty-four genes have no sequence homologs in h. sapiens. thirty of these have functional homologs, while  <dig> genes identified as potential targets do not have any human functional or sequence homolog .

local structural similarities
there is a possibility that potential cross-reactivity targets may perform different functions  and have little sequence similarity yet still have sufficient 3d atomic binding-site similarities to be inhibited by a drug developed against a c. difficile target. we proceeded to analyse binding-site similarities to detect potential cross-reactivity targets for the  <dig> c. difficile proteins where sequence or functional similarity search did not detect any human homolog. binding-site similarities are measured in terms of detected geometrically and chemically equivalent atoms in common between two binding-sites  <cit> . we found an average of  <dig> atoms in common between binding-sites  for  <dig> out of  <dig> models with members of pfam families  <cit>  that include human proteins. in three cases, ispf, cd <dig> and daph, no significant level of binding-site similarity was found to a pfam family that contains human homologs .

it is hard to judge if the found matches are significant or not considering that no threshold for binding-site similarity can be uniquely defined above which cross-reactivity is certain  <cit> . however, in  <dig> cases out of  <dig> cases, the top-scoring detected binding-site similarities for each case represent binding-sites in proteins that bind ligands that are similar to at least one of the substrates of the reaction catalyzed by the modelled c. difficile protein. in seven of those cases, the top matching pfam family that contains human homologs binds a similar ligand . taking as an example the case of the enzyme encoded by the asd gene, we detect  <dig> atoms  in common to a glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase from spinach  bound to nadph, a member of pfam family pf <dig> that has human homologs . five out of the top  <dig> most similar binding-sites also bind nadph or nadp, all from different pfam families. the superimposition of these diverse binding-sites based on their similarities to the asd gene product binding-site leads to an extremely good superposition of their respective bound-ligands . this suggests that the detected similarities are biologically significant. the quality of the resulting superimpositions together with the detection of similarities across families that bind similar ligands to those that bind the c. difficile targets reinforces the confidence in the biological significance of our predictions. the quality of the alignment of the nadp molecules across different families via the detected similarities suggests that these capture the molecular determinants responsible for binding. as such determinants are conserved across protein families, there is a possibility that these are also conserved within families and thus present in the human homolog. in most cases, the similarities that were detected actually represent commonly used cofactors or other ubiquitously used ligands, such as nadp above or atp. these results do not necessarily mean that a drug targeting the c. difficile protein will bind the human homolog belonging to the detected pfam families, but these should be used as potential cross-reactivity targets in the rational design of inhibitors against the c. difficile protein in question. furthermore, given that the detected similarities focus on common cofactors and ubiquitous molecules such as atp, the results also suggest that targeting the sub-pockets of less ubiquitously used substrates may reduce the chance of cross-reactivity.figure  <dig>

metabolic essentiality
the inhibition of potential human cross-reactivity targets detected by sequence, functional or 3d binding-site similarities may not necessarily lead to any serious side effects. as a result of the differences between human and c. difficile metabolism, a protein may be essential in the former but non-essential in the later. we sought to use fba to determine if inhibition of human homologs of predicted essential c. difficile proteins could have any effect on the human cell. to do so, we performed a gene deletion fba analysis on the latest draft of the human reconstructed metabolic network recon <dig>  <cit> . in the case of functional homologs all reactions associated to the human homolog of the c. difficile target were removed for the fba analysis from the human network. likewise, in the case of the  <dig> c. difficile potential targets without human functional homologs but with detected binding-site similarities, we identified all human proteins from the pfam families where similarities were detected and deleted all recon <dig> reactions associated . we opted for this conservative approach to simulate a situation in which a potential drug would inhibit all potential cross-reactivity targets. only  <dig> predicted essential c. difficile genes have predicted essential human cross-reactivity targets . for all others, the presence of a human potential cross-reactivity target may not be sufficient to discard it as a potential target.

double gene deletions
we performed double gene deletions to identify potential polypharmacological targets and to target reactions that are catalyzed by isoenzymes. based on fba analysis,  <dig> gene pairs involving  <dig> unique genes that had small or no effect in single gene deletion were deleterious when removed in pairs. an additional  <dig> essential gene pairs involving  <dig> new unique genes were found using sa. eight gene pairs were considered essential in both sa and fba .

some double mutants show a synergistic effect, defined as an effect greater that an additional 1% reduction in biomass production in the double mutant than the sum of effects of each single mutant. the  <dig> synergistic double mutants were analysed in more detail . thirteen of these synergistic gene combinations resulted in total abolition of biomass production in fba or prevented the biosynthesis of at least one element of the biomass in sa,  <dig> had an effect between 10% and 20% and the remaining  <dig> had a small effect on biomass production . twelve of the essential pairs of genes are isoenzymes that catalyze the same reactions. sixteen gene pairs represent enzymes involved in pathways with the same functional category while the remaining  <dig> gene pairs affect different pathways . all essential pairs identified by both sa and fba are isoenzymes whose removal results in a total arrest of biomass production.figure  <dig> 
effect of the deletion of essential genes and deletion of essential pairs of genes in term of biomass lost. essential genes removal identified by sa were considered to give a null biomass if one of the component of the biomass was impossible to produce otherwise they were arbitrary attributed an effect of 5-10% since the number of reaction required to produce biomass augmented by less than 10% in every cases. the number of cases in the unlabelled sections of the pie chart is in clockwise order  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 



isoenzymes usually result in a higher biomass loss than relatively distant pairs . for the  <dig> isoenzymes, the deletion of the two genes in a pair is required to remove a reaction that is catalysed by both. for the remaining essential gene pairs, the reactions associated with both genes are used in parallel in the wild type, a case of metabolic plasticity  <cit> , or the reactions from only one of the genes is used while the reaction from the other member of the pair can act as a backup, a case of metabolic redundancy  <cit> . depending on the category in which an essential gene pair falls, different strategies may be required in order to target the pair  <cit> . from the  <dig> essential genes pairs,  <dig> represent cases of plasticity of the network and  <dig> cases of redundancy in the network .

distribution of predicted essential genes across pathways
in order to see which parts of metabolism are more enriched with essential genes, we classified reactions into  <dig> functional pathway classifications . a hypergeometric test  <cit>  for over and under-representation was performed to identify pathways enrichment in essential genes. this analysis confirmed that linear pathways, like lipid synthesis, tend to have more essential genes  due to the lack of alternative ways leading to the production of biomass metabolites .figure  <dig> 
distribution of genes , deleterious genes  and genes involved in deleterious pair  in the different metabolic pathways. if one gene was present in more than one reaction that did not share the same metabolic function the most relevant function was manually chosen based on gene description.



potential compounds binding predicted essential targets
molecules potentially binding the proteins encoded by the  <dig> genes identified as potential targets on their own  or as part of pairs  were identified based on sequence homology  between predicted essential proteins and entries in the drugbank database version  <dig> beta  <cit>  . a total of  <dig> molecules bind  <dig> protein entries from drugbank with homologs among  <dig> predicted essential c. difficile targets. while the list includes cofactors, binders, inhibitors and activators, all such molecules bind the homologs of the predicted essential c. difficile targets. most of these molecules are still experimental. interestingly,  <dig> molecules are approved drugs based on drugbank annotation. among these we have celurelin predicted to bind to the product of two distinct predicted essential genes in the same pathway: fabf and fabh . mycophenolic acid and ribavirin are predicted to bind the predicted essential product of guab and, tcl a potential inhibitor of the product of cd <dig> which is essential only as part of double mutant with fabg. the double inhibition could be achieved with the use of the experimental molecules linked with fabg such as emo, max or tdb. lastly, pyridoxal phosphate is a potential binder of two proteins that are part of a pair whose double mutation is predicted to be lethal . the identification of any potential binding small-molecules  is useful since there is a chance that these molecules may also bind the predicted essential c. difficile homolog protein and this information could be used as a basis for the development of more potent and selective inhibitors. this analysis also helps elucidate the role of pyridoxine, an essential vitamin that has no direct effect on biomass, since pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor that binds two genes  part of the same essential pair. in a similar way, we can elucidate one of the reasons for biotin essentiality via its identification as a co-factor for accc, a predicted essential gene as single mutant. this list remains to be experimentally validated but is meant as a starting point in targeting any one of the genes predicted as being essential in the network.table  <dig>

discussion
in this work we present imltc806cdf, a highly curated metabolic network of the nosocomial pathogen clostridium difficile strain  <dig>  this metabolic network is functional in the sense of being amenable to simulations using flux balance analysis to measure biomass production in diverse types of media. imltc806cdf is available in sbml, tsv and excel formats. the network is based on the aggregation of metabolic data present in databases, augmented with information from various sources of experimental data from the literature and manually curated in order to ensure a high quality of the resulting network.

metabolic networks bring together information from various databases. due to inaccuracies, contradictions and missing information in each database  <cit> , the non-curated network resulting from the simple aggregation of all these sources of information is often incomplete and includes a large number of errors, missing data and repetitions, which make the generated networks unusable  <cit> . different databases will often have multiple identifiers for highly similar entries, which cause duplications. surprisingly, this is true not only for reactions and metabolites where curation is more difficult but also for genes. manual curation is essential to correct inaccuracies present in metabolic databases and particularly to fill gaps  necessary to remove dead-end metabolites to create a functional network. manual curation is a time consuming, expensive and non-scalable process. unfortunately, it is also indispensable at this time as can be attested by the  <dig> predicted essential genes  that do not even appear in the automatically generated c. difficile network. it is clear that the automated generation of functional metabolic networks is a worthwhile goal. however, at present automatically generated networks are not functional. at this time, such networks can only be used at best as a starting point prior to intensive manual curation. their use as starting points however subtracts very little to the manual work required to produce a functional network.

in some sense, metabolic networks serve as a tool to aggregate all existing knowledge about the metabolism of an organism. clearly, the more well studied an organism is, the more information exists to build and validate such a network. c. difficile is an organism that is not well studied due to a number of factors. first, being a pathogen severely restricts the number of active researchers studying it given the experimental requirements in terms of biosafety. second, c. difficile presents particular challenges that make genetic manipulations notoriously difficult. until recently, genetic studies in c. difficile were restrained by the lack of efficient tools to inactivate specific genes. the recent development of a universal gene knockout system in clostridia has opened new possibilities and it is now somewhat easier to disrupt genes in a very specific and directed manner  <cit> . this system called clostron is based on retargeting of the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb group ii intron so that upon transfer into c. difficile by conjugation, the intron integrates at a specific user-defined chromosomal site. with the advent of clostron our knowledge of the biology of c. difficile and the identification of essential genes is bound to increase but at the moment, there is a lack of c. difficile specific literature and that limits the completeness and validation of the network. some information such as biomass constituents and protein-protein interactions had to be extrapolated from other closely related species. the metabolic pathways involved in linking dead-end metabolites to the rest of the network also sometimes had to be extrapolated due to lack of experimental data. no in-depth studies exist of the directionality of reactions as it was done in e. coli  <cit> , or association between biomass production and predicted growth rate as it was done in b. subtilis  <cit> , due to the absence of metabolomics data and precise growth rate experiments for c. difficile. while information can be extrapolated from closely related organisms, fundamental differences still exist and may be a source of potential errors. notwithstanding the existing limitations in creating and validating a c. difficile specific network, imltc806cdf is as complete or more than existing curated networks and accounts for all existing relevant experimental information. we hope that in addition to being a tool to aggregate existing knowledge, imltc806cdf will prove to be valuable as a nucleation point in developing our understanding of this important human pathogen driving the generation of new experimental hypotheses.

the analysis of a metabolic network in isolation in the absence of other relevant processes present in the organism poses its own problems. for example, the effect of metabolites   <cit>  involved in non-metabolic processes could not be simulated. likewise, methionine added to minimal media greatly increases growth in vitro  <cit>  but the addition of methionine to the minimal media in imltc806cdf increases biomass by less than 1%. methionine is mostly used in the bacteria as s-adenosyl methionine involved in the biosynthesis of cofactors and vitamins which are not directly involved in biomass synthesis and have an effect that cannot be simulated in the metabolic network  <cit> . while the removal of methionine produced a qualitatively correct outcome, the loss of biomass in the network when removing methionine from the minimal medium is only due to the additional reactions required to produce enough methionine as required for biomass production.

the case of pantothenate, the only essential vitamin with a clear metabolic effect is unique, as its essentiality is strain-dependant. a biosynthesis pathway for panthothenate was recently identified in c. difficile strain  <dig>  <cit>  and is present in some other strains based on metacyc. as a result, this vitamin is a non-essential component of the growth medium based on our in silico analysis. this vitamin is however essential in a number of strains previously tested  <cit> , which did not include either strain  <dig> or the others containing this pathway in metacyc.

the comparison with c. acetobutylicum network  <cit>  indicates that both bacteria share the same metabolic core. existing differences in reactions and associated genes may explain the differences obtained while comparing the effects of deleted genes and reactions. the different media utilized for both bacteria may also cause some differences.

the comparison with experimental results for b. subtillis  <cit>  was used as validation due to the absence of experimental results for the gene essentiality in c. difficile. while essential differences exist between the two organisms, a large degree of conservation is also present. therefore one should expect that a large number of genes conserve their essentiality across these two species. the high level of accuracy  between the experimental results and our predictions serves as a validation of imltc806cdf as a mature draft metabolic network and increases our confidence in the list of predicted essential genes. one important difference between the metabolism of c. difficile and b. subtilis is that the later can use oxygen to produce energy while the former cannot. therefore, predicted essential c. difficile genes involved in fermentation such as pykf or acka are not essential in b. subtilis. other genes such as fabh, cd <dig> and ribc are only present in one copy in c. difficile while more than one gene catalyses the same reactions in b. subtilis  <cit> , explaining why such genes are non-essential in the latter.

some genes whose inactivation is deleterious in vitro are not identified in silico due to their implication in non-metabolic processes. both imltc806cdf and the network of bacillus subtilis  <cit>  fail to identify the essentiality of cd <dig>  due to its implication in regulatory processes. in addition, the toxicity of a molecule cannot be simulated in silico either. therefore, the essentiality of genes involved in detoxification or whose deletion leads to the accumulation of toxic molecules cannot be simulated. for example, the removal of cd <dig> would lead to an accumulation of nicotinate that could be toxic. this effect cannot be simulated in the network, therefore cd <dig> is not considered essential in the network but is essential in vivo in b. subtilis  <cit> .

the combined use of fba and sa allowed us to detect more essential genes than using either technique alone. their joint use increases our confidence on the predictions for those genes where the two techniques agree. at the same time, the two techniques complement each other. for example, the gene acps catalyses the only reaction that leads to the production of a holo-acyl-carrier protein from the apo version of the protein. this reaction is essential since the holo form of the protein is required to perform the elongation of lipids. the presence of a cycle that allows for the reutilisation of the released holo-acyl-carrier protein at the end of lipid elongation prevents fba to identify the deletion of acps as deleterious. the analysis by sa uses the apo version of the acyl-carrier protein and predicts acps as essential since without it, the holo form cannot be produced. new targets were also found when using sa for double mutants. targets identified by sa are mostly isoenzymes that lead to deletion of new reactions in the shortest possible pathway leading to the production of essential biomass metabolites.

the gene deletion analysis identified interesting potential therapeutic targets. targets such as the aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase  asd  or the diaminopimelate epimerase  dapf  that do not have human functional homologs, decrease the chance of side effects due to cross-reactivity. another predicted essential gene, the aspartate-ammonia ligase  asna  is up-regulated in vivo and could be important for the pathogenesis of the bacteria  <cit> . most targets like cd <dig>  dxr and ispf have more than one of these characteristics and would be interesting for more than one reason.

as a result of the conservation of local binding site environments  <cit> , drugs often targets proteins in a way that might not be sequence-dependent. to account for that effect, we used functional homologs to identify potential human cross-reactivity targets for predicted essential c. difficile proteins. this made for a more stringent analysis since the number of potential human functional homologs is almost twice as large as those based on sequence similarity alone. the absence of a human homolog is often used as a criteria for identification of potential drug target  <cit> . if no homolog is present, there is a smaller probability that a drug targeting this specific protein have an effect in humans.

for those cases where sequence or functional homology did not detect potential human cross-reactivity targets, we utilized the detection of local binding site similarities. this analysis identified protein families with human representatives that harbour large binding-site similarities to the c. difficile targets in the absence of sequence or functional similarities. the detected similarities are primarily localized to binding-sites of cofactors and ubiquitously used ligands such as nadp or atp. it is important to keep in mind that it is not possible to determine a minimum similarity threshold other than 100% above which one can be certain that the detected human proteins will act as cross-reactivity targets as small differences can bring about drastic effects  <cit> .

the presence of a human potential cross-reactivity target  is not sufficient to evaluate whether or not targeting a particular target might have important side effects since the human protein might not be essential. the use of predicted essentiality of human functional homologs or those with detected binding-site similarities in recon <dig>  <cit>  in conjunction with their essentiality in c. difficile represents a more consistent analysis of targets across hosts and pathogens. to our knowledge this use metabolic networks across species to determine the potential of a target to have cross-reactivity targets leading to side effects is novel.

a “perfect” predicted essential target would be one without  potential cross-reactivity targets in human and e. coli , with essential homologs in b. subtilis and up-regulated in vivo. although no c. difficile target could be found fulfilling all properties at once, the  <dig> potentially essential targets identified  fulfil several of these properties and could, once validated experimentally serve as a target for the development of new antibiotics.

the list of active molecules that potentially bind predicted essential targets includes many molecules that could help in the validation of the targets in c. difficile and the development of novel drugs  <cit> . experimental validation is required to determine if the identified small-molecules do bind the c. difficile homologs. some of these small-molecules, such as the approved anti-viral ribavirin, could speed the approval of c. difficile specific inhibitors through drug repositioning. in the case of ribavirin, the molecule is a rapidly absorbed guanosine analog currently used in the treatment of influenza  <cit>  and hepatitis c  <cit> . cerulenin has anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity targeting fabf in b. subtilis  <cit> , thus very likely targeting the same protein in c. difficile as we predicted. in all cases, the multiple small molecules predicted to bind the predicted essential c. difficile proteins could be used to bias library selection for the rational development of new inhibitors.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current work we present the first extensively curated metabolic network reconstruction for c. difficile  imltc806cdf and validate it with experimental data on essential metabolites and carbon sources. we compare imltc806cdf to existing networks showing the importance of manual curation and use the network to predict essential genes. the predictions agree with experimental data for b. subtilis . we detect potential cross-reactivity targets for each of these genes using a variety of methods combining systems and structural computational biology and determine that for only  <dig> out of  <dig> predicted essential genes, if exiting, the potential human cross-reactivity targets are themselves essential in the human metabolic network reconstruction recon <dig>  for a number of essential genes we find potential binding small molecules, including approved drugs such as ribavirin, which may inhibit the respective gene products. we hope that imltc806cdf will find further use in the community and the results here lead to the development of novel antibiotics against c. difficile infections.
