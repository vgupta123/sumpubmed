BACKGROUND
mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the mammary gland caused primarily by microorganisms, usually bacteria, that invade the udder, multiply and secrete toxic products that are very harmful to the host. in canada, environmental mastitis  is most commonly caused by escherichia coli. this infection is generally short taking a few days to be eliminated by the immune system, but the animal presents severe clinical signs that include inflammation of the udder, milk clots and altered behaviour . with annual costs for the herd of approximately $ <dig> per cow  <cit> , mastitis is still the most commonly occurring disease in canadian dairy herds. these important losses to producers result not only from early culling and treatment costs, but also from the adverse effects of the decrease in production, and the need to discard milk that is unfit for human consumption because it is infected or contains antibiotic residues  <cit> .

the mammary gland is typically a sterile environment and, therefore, the entry of any foreign body usually triggers a localized immune response. the first line of defence against disease-causing microorganisms is the innate immune system, which induces mechanisms that are not pathogen species-specific  <cit> . innate immune cells in the mammary gland are comprised of macrophages, granulocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic and mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . these cells have receptors that recognize motifs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns  on the surface of microorganisms. for example, the lipopolysaccharides on the surface of gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli become attached to the phagocytic cells via toll-like receptor  <dig> , whereas toll-like receptor  <dig>  binds to gram-positive motifs such as peptidoglycan or lipoteichoic acid on the surface of s. aureus  <cit> .

recognition of an invading pathogen activates cellular reactions, leading to the secretion of inflammatory mediators called cytokines. these signalling molecules trigger cellular communication, chemotaxis and lymphocyte differentiation. the cytokines include inflammatory interleukins--1β, - <dig> and - <dig>  tumour necrosis factor-alpha  and interferon-gamma   <cit> . once phagocytic cells recognize and internalize pathogens, the cells present the pathogen's antigenic determinants to the t lymphocytes. then these cells, in the presence of il- <dig>  differentiate into th <dig> effector cells which are responsible for cell-mediated immunity. these th <dig> cells produce inflammatory mediators such as ifn-γ, that enhance macrophage effectors functions against intracellular pathogens  <cit> .

macrophages are the predominant cells in the healthy mammary gland  <cit> . during intramammary infection, however, a release of inflammatory mediators, especially by macrophages, leads to the recruitment of neutrophils into infected quarters from the circulation. at this stage, these cells account for more than 90% of milk cells  <cit> . the neutrophils are responsible for the eventual elimination of the pathogens. for example, activated neutrophils degranulate and produce/secrete bactericidal components, namely reactive oxygen species   <cit> . the recruitment of neutrophils into the mammary gland causes an increase in somatic cell count  that can reach more than  <dig> , <dig> cells/ml during the course of an infection, whereas the scc is normally less than  <dig>  cells/ml in a healthy mammary gland  <cit> .

prevention and control of mastitis by improving the natural defence mechanisms is important not only for dairy producers but also for consumers, because of increased concerns about food safety, antibiotic use and animal welfare  <cit> . one approach would be to define breeding objectives with increased weight of health-related traits in genetic selection  <cit> . genetic selection to increase antibody responsiveness seems to be possible, but the acquired immune response traits have proven to be inconsistent indicators of udder health  <cit> . components of the adaptive immune system have been studied intensively, but there is still need for the development of efficient vaccine against pathogens that cause intramammary infection for bovine  <cit> . unlike the adaptive immune system, some mechanisms of the innate immunity are conserved throughout the animal kingdom and can thus be thought of as general mechanisms responsible for broad environmental responses. these evolutionarily conserved systems have been analyzed in detail and include, among others, the complement gene family  <cit>  and the toll-like receptors   <cit> . the parameters of innate immune responses can be used to study resistance to mastitis. these results can lead to the selection of breeding animals that carry favorable polymorphisms or alleles able to improve the resistance to infection of their offspring.  <cit> .

genetic parameters such as heritability and phenotypic and genetic correlations are useful statistical tools for measuring the genetic component of a trait or group of traits. these genetic parameters do not require any knowledge about the number of genes involved as they are estimated from correlations of phenotypic data among relatives. the present study is based essentially on the somatic cell score , because data for clinical mastitis prevalence are still not available for the canadian dairy population  <cit> . however, the usefulness of scs as an indirect selection tool for reducing mastitis has been reported in several studies  <cit> . most estimates of the genetic correlation between scs and clinical mastitis range from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . in a recent study, the genetic correlation was observed to ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . these are reasonably high values which suggest that scc and mastitis occurrence are partly caused by the expression of the same trait. the scc distribution is often highly skewed and it is usually transformed on a logarithm scale, as follows: scs = log <dig>  +  <dig>  <cit> . when used for genetic evaluation, bulls receive an estimated breeding value  based on the scs records of their daughters. if dairy producers select bulls with a low ebv for scs, this is expected to improve mastitis resistance in their herd  <cit> . the scs has now become the most important indicator associated with the health of the mammary gland, but little is known about the key factors which regulate the number of somatic cells in milk from healthy cows. thus, in the present study we investigated the early activated transcripts of immune cells of the lactating mammary gland in order to identify a key gene in the innate immune response to mastitis.

osteopontin  is a cytokine produced by macrophages and activated t cells  <cit> . osteopontin has been described as an early component of the t cell activation mechanism. enhanced in t cells, it recruits macrophages at the infection site and improves cell-mediated immunity  by inducing secretion of th <dig> cytokines  <cit> . osteopontin is a multi-faced protein  <cit> . it promotes bone remodelling  <cit> , wound healing and survival of stressed cells  <cit> , but is also associated with metastasis status and poor survival prognosis  <cit> . it was found associated with certain pathologies such as restenosis, formation of kidney stones, and autoimmune disease  <cit> , but also found to confer resistance to several intracellular pathogen infections through recruitment and activation of macrophages  <cit> . in this study, we reported the detection of this abundant transcript, which is expressed early on during mastitis. following the detection of this key gene in the mammary somatic cells isolated early during the immune response, we evaluated the association of spp <dig> with scc, which is the most widely used indicator of mastitis  <cit> . identifying favourable spp <dig> alleles for mastitis resistance would make it possible for dairy breeders to increase them in the canadian holstein population to potentially increase the natural resistance to mammary gland infection.

RESULTS
experimental mastitis and detection of the candidate gene
an infectious dose of  <dig> ±  <dig> cfu of a fresh exponential culture of e. coli was used and produced a bacterial infection in all challenged quarters  of the four lactating cows: groups  <dig> h  and  <dig> h . the front control quarters, which had been infused with saline, remained free of bacteria. there were no apparent signs of clinical infection at  <dig> h whereas infection was confirmed by  <dig> h. these two cows showed signs of clinical infection: clotting in milk, fever , and local redness along with pain after  <dig> h. the tumour necrosis factor-alpha  was detectable in milk at  <dig> h post-infection . increases in both scc and granulocytes in milk were highly correlated between  <dig> and  <dig> h post-challenge , which confirmed that granulocytes were the major invading cells in the mammary gland upon infection. during the same 6-to-9-h period, macrophages drastically decreased in proportion . only  <dig> to 4% remained detectable whereas in the bacteria-free quarters, a significant level  of macrophages was maintained. the inflection point for this longitudinal survey was  <dig> h. indeed, no changes in the distribution of lymphocytes, macrophages and granulocytes in milk, between infected quarters  and uninfected quarters  were apparent in the first  <dig> h post-infection . we thus monitored the molecular events prior to the increase of granulocytes  in milk. the differential transcripts of milk immune cells were analysed at  <dig> h post-infection. one hundred clones from the cdna library of milk immune cells were sequenced . the spp <dig> transcript was identified using the basic local alignment search tool  to search against the national center for biotechnology information  database. this induction of spp <dig> transcript was also observed in pbmc  challenged in vitro with heat-inactivated bacteria as described in material and methods. the increased spp <dig> transcripts abundance in pbmc was detected within  <dig> h  by real-time rt-pcr in three independent assays .

analysis of the spp <dig> genomic sequence
search for dna polymorphisms was performed by selecting bulls with extreme ebv for scs . each different genomic region of spp <dig>  were sequenced as described in materials and methods. comparison of the results of the electrophoregrams from the two groups presenting extreme ebv for the scs trait uncovered differences in the allelic distribution of four nucleotides. two single-nucleotide polymorphisms  were found in the promoter. a novel snp was identified and has been submitted to ncbi dbsnp on april 23rd  <dig> . this novel transition snp  and the transition snp spp1c.-1251c>t were found respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  nucleotides  before the atg  codon, which initiates translation from exon  <dig>  the third transition snp  was located in the first intron,  <dig> nt upstream from the start codon. lastly, the transversion snp  was found  <dig> nt downstream from the stop codon in exon  <dig> within the 3' utr. no snps were found in the coding region. we scrutinized the electrophoregrams in the  <dig> -to- <dig> -nucleotide region upstream from the atg gene corresponding to the insertion and deletion  variation rs <dig>  which had been reported elsewhere  <cit> . no such variation was observed in the population sequenced.

snps and allelic frequencies
genotypic and allelic frequencies of the four snps for the  <dig> bulls are summarized in table  <dig>  all snps were checked for conformance with the hardy-weinberg equilibrium, as determined by the chi-square test. the frequency of the alleles varied in the population. some alleles were present in low frequency, such as allele a  for the snp spp1c.-1301g>a, which also explained the low abundance of homozygous bulls  in the population tested. homozygous bulls harbouring the genotype t for spp1c.-1251c>t and genotype a for spp1c.-430g>a were not frequent , and the abundance of these alleles was  <dig> % for both among the  <dig> genotyped bulls. these two snps were linked in the population tested: allele c for spp1c.-1251c>t was linked to allele g for spp1c.-430g>a, and vice versa . for the snp spp1c.*40a>c,  <dig> % of the bulls were homozygous for allele c, a proportion of 30% in the population genotyped .

snp associations
the ebvs for scs at the first, second and third lactations and for over all lactations are reported according to the genotypes for spp1c.-1301g>a, spp1c.-1251c>t, spp1c.-430g>a and spp1c.*40a>c . allele g of spp1c.-1301g>a had a favourable impact on scs ebv at any lactation . the snp spp1c.-1251c>t and spp1c.-430g>a did not have an effect on scs ebv , but genotypic comparison showed a significant difference for the third lactation only between homozygous and heterozygous bulls for the dominant allele . the statistical analysis also revealed a stronger association between spp1c.*40a>c and ebvs for scs as the number of lactations increased: first lactation , second lactation  and third lactation .

b, c means  without a common superscript letter differ from each other at the 5% level of significance.

the estimated average allele substitution effects are presented in table  <dig>  no significant association of snp spp1c.-1301g>a was detected with scs in any of the lactations. the snp spp1c.-1251c>t and spp1c.-430g>a were significant at a comparison-wise level in association with ebvs for scs , scs <dig> , and scs <dig> . the estimated substitution effect was about the same for scs <dig> but the larger se crushed the statistical validity . the allele substitution effects for spp1c.-1251c>t for over all, first, and second lactations are respectively  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> . thus, the increase in scs for allele t over allele c corresponded to 33% of the sd for scs ebv. the same effects on ebv for scs were found for spp1c.-430g>a, but the negative allelic substitution effect carried by allele a had the opposite effect . although it was not significant for the first lactation , the 3' utr snp spp1c.*40a>c was associated with ebvs for scs <dig> , scs <dig>  and over all lactations ; the corresponding allele substitution effects for this snp were - <dig>  ±  <dig> , - <dig>  ±  <dig>  and - <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, meaning that allele c reduces scs over allele a.

effect of spp <dig> snps for production traits
the average substitution effect of the snp spp1c.-1301g>a was significant for milk yield from the second  and third  lactations. substitution of allele g over allele a decreased the ebv for milk yield by the equivalent of  <dig> kg and  <dig> kg, respectively . although no significant effect was observed for fat or protein yield , the same allele g had a favourable effect on the ebvs for the fat and protein percentages. protein percentages were associated with the snp in the second  and third  lactations , whereas the effects for fat percentages were observed for all three lactations, as follows:  <dig> % ±  <dig>  ,  <dig> % ±  <dig>   and  <dig> % ±  <dig>  , respectively. none of the three other snps was found to have a significant allelic substitution effect when associated with the ebvs for production traits  or any significant effect using the regression model . however, all three snps were associated with ebvs for fat yield and fat percentage  .

discussion
the objective of this work was to identify one candidate of the innate immune response, to define the association of the genetic variants with the immune cells in milk, but also to evaluate their impact on other traits related to dairy production. osteopontin has been described as an early component of the t cell activation mechanism and was also detected in the immune cells in the present study during the first hours of e. coli infection. this confirms the results of other studies which show the importance of osteopontin in inflammatory responses. the expression of spp <dig> is enhanced in t cells during bacterial infection in order to recruit macrophages to the infection site and to improve cell-mediated immunity  by increasing the secretion of th <dig> cytokines  <cit> . indeed, knockout spp1-/- mice have shown significantly impaired th <dig> immunity to viral and bacterial infections with diminished production of interleukin- <dig>  and interferon-gamma  and elevated production of interleukin- <dig>   <cit> . however, no studies have been carried out to correlate osteopontin with mastitis.

innate immune responses are activated by a cross-species conserved signalling pathway. study of this activation could lead to the identification of candidates genes for disease resistance. the detection of favourable allelic variants of the innate immune response genes will make it possible to select progeny with a more efficient immune system. because of the potential immunological role of spp <dig> in the milk of cows diagnosed with mastitis, the next step was the validation of spp <dig> genetic variants that would explain the scs observed in the dairy population. indeed, although scs in milk is an indirect measure of cow health status, scs is considered to be the most widely used biological marker of clinical mastitis in lactating cows  <cit> . we thus found polymorphisms in the genomic sequence of spp <dig> that influence the number of somatic cells in milk and, potentially, influence their susceptibility to mastitis, although this latter assumption remains to be validated. through the use of animals with extreme ebv for scs, a novel snp was discovered in the promoter region of spp <dig> ,  <dig> nucleotides  upstream from the snp spp1c.-1251c>t.

the 5' utr snp spp1c.-1251c>t and spp1c.-430g>a, and the 3' utr snp spp1c.*40a>c were also identified both in the present study and in a previous one  <cit> . these dna polymorphisms were not investigated for an association with scs. however, these authors found one dna polymorphism  that had an effect on the fat and protein percentage traits, based on the results of  <dig> bull sires, but was not associated with scs  <cit> . this indel polymorphism, which corresponds to polyt tract alleles of either nine or  <dig> thymines , is absent from the  <dig> bulls sequenced in the present study, and also from the mouse  <cit> , human and swine spp <dig> promoter . the bovine spp <dig> region containing this polymorphism  was aligned with other mammals using the clustalw algorithm . this region does not contain any transcription factor  motifs . the t9/t <dig> indel polymorphism may not associate with tf. it is located  <dig>  nt upstream from the novel spp1c.-1301g>a, is absent from sequenced individuals selected, and thus may not be a functional snp for the scs trait. therefore, we cannot exclude this t9/t <dig> indel polymorphism from the canadian population, since the present experimental design does not address differences among bulls with extreme ebvs based on production traits .

we searched for cross-species similarity in regions of the genome containing the snp detected in the present study. both of the snps in the promoter are very similar to other species . interestingly, these regions included a "gc-rich" area identical to both the mouse and the human regions. among the potential functional factors that could explain the impact on the ebv for the scs, ikzf <dig>  and sp <dig> are two tfs that recognize binding sites at or in the vicinity of the snp . the tf sp <dig> binds specifically to gc box dna within the 5' flanking promoter sequences for promoting eukaryotic transcription  <cit> . specifically, the tf sp <dig> binds to the spp <dig> promoter and is involved in th <dig> immune responses  <cit> . the tf ikzf <dig> is a regulator of th <dig> responses  <cit> . in that way, allele g of spp1c.-1301g>a abolishes ikzf <dig> recognition . thus, impaired ikzf <dig> binding would have the consequence of promoting a th <dig> immune response in the absence of a th <dig> polarizing effect on naive immune cells  <cit> . impaired ikzf <dig> binding could also facilitate the access of sp <dig>  through its binding activity, which is present in the vicinity of spp1c.-1301g>a . this hypothesis is supported by the fact that allele a is associated with an elevated scs , scs having been associated with increased mastitis incidence  <cit> . indeed, an inefficient th <dig> response or abrogated innate immunity predisposes cows to environmental mastitis.

an additional sp <dig> recognition site was found in the location of spp1c.-1251c>t, with allele t abolishing the sp <dig> gc box recognition . this tf binding site has been found to colocalize with the human "-66t" snp, which is referred to as the human spp <dig> transcription starting site  <cit> . the authors, hummelshoj et coll., confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that recognition of the tf sp <dig> is influenced by the presence of dna polymorphism. furthermore, using a luciferase assay reporting the spp <dig> promoter, they observed increased activity with allele t compared to allele c for the corresponding - <dig> t/g snp  <cit> . alignment of human and bovine sequences revealed that the - <dig> t/g snp is located  <dig> nt from the bovine snp spp1c.-1251c>t, both within the tf sp <dig> binding site. although it remains to be confirmed, the influence of the snp spp1c.-1251c>t on the regulation of the bovine promoter is highly plausible. indeed, the regulation of promoters based around the sp family binding protein has been observed in a number of housekeeping genes. these factors act as transcriptional activators in mammalian cells  <cit> . since sp <dig> recruits the basal transcription machinery and controls the rate of transcription  <cit> , it thus explains the constitutive secretion of osteopontin in several biological fluids  and its distribution in a very broad variety of tissues  <cit> . our results suggest that the absence of the sp <dig> dna binding site would impair or reduce the transcription activity of the spp <dig> promoter. unless validation of the spp <dig> transcript or osteopontin protein from cows harbouring allele c or t spp1c.-1251c>t is performed  the veracity of the tangible impact of spp1c.-1251c>t on bacterial infection remains unknown. further study by in vitro assay using reporter genes and binding shift assays could help elucidate the impact of promoter variants on transcription activity.

lastly, two other binding sites, the nuclear factor of activated t cells  and the interferon-stimulated response element , were positioned close to spp1c.-430g>a , located in the first intron. the nf-at promotes cell proliferation and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as il- <dig> and spp <dig>  <cit> , whereas isre would regulate the expression of spp <dig>  <cit> . a polymorphism in this region could potentially affect the binding of these two tfs and influence the rapidity of the response of spp <dig> to infection. therefore, functional studies are required to interrogate the significance of this snp with tf binding and gene expression.

in an association study, neither spp1c.-1251c>t nor spp1c.-430g>a was found to be associated with scs . we found that these two are linked , which could explain why only heterozygous animals , when compared to their respective homozygotes, had an impact on scs. this was also shown by their opposite allelic substitution effects . therefore, both allele c for spp1c.-1251c>t and allele a for spp1c. 430g>a, which are linked to g and t, respectively, would be required to compensate for the negative effect of the second allele.

as innate immunity is not an adaptive immune response, an association study regarding the genetics should not be modulated as time passes. in other words, immune response should be maintained, irrespective of the number of times the pathogen is encountered. indeed, this constant trend  was observed regarding the allele substitution effect , which means that cows harbouring the favourable allele do not benefit  in later parities from these spp1c.-1251c>t and spp1c.-430g>a snps. the snp spp1c.-1301g>a was only found to be associated with scs in the regression model . however, it may also have an impact that was not revealed by the allele substitution effect. because of the discrepancy in the abundance of both alleles , the substitution effect may not be statistically significant.

for the fourth spp1c.*40a>c snp, it is less clear how the 3' utr dna polymorphisms affect spp <dig>  although a more general mechanism such as microrna would affect transcript stability. we cannot exclude that spp <dig> would be relatively more stable than other transcripts in milk cells. although amplitude of the spp <dig> induction was smaller than tnf transcript, both were correlated as the bacterial challenge of the pbmc progressed . the tnf-α is an important inflammatory mediator involved in neutrophil recruitment  <cit>  and spp <dig> might activate or maintained the th1-th <dig> balance. thus spp <dig> could be either an upregulated gene or stabilized transcript. microrna are an important class of regulatory rna that repress animal genes by preferentially interacting with complementary sequence motifs in the 3' utr of target mrna  <cit> . the importance of the region is further highlighted by the presence of the spp1c.*40a>c snp within two other bovine species. the presence of this dna polymorphisms was detected within the guernsey  and jerseys  cows . whereas both human and mouse 3' utr of spp <dig> are the target of several microrna, retrieved by an in silico search , this hypothesis remains to be verified for the bovine spp <dig> 3' utr sequences.

in previous studies, nine dna polymorphisms were found within eight sires sequenced for the spp <dig> gene. whereas one snp was associated with production traits , this "opn3909" was not found associated with scs  <cit> . the main reason may be inherent to the selection of the holstein dairy cattle population, which in our study was based on extreme ebv for scs from a directory of  <dig>  bulls . how spp <dig> may affect fat yield and fat percentage in bovine milk remains an open question. in humans, a significant positive correlation was found between osteopontin levels and body fat as well as circulating concentrations of total cholesterol  <cit> . osteopontin is also associated with cholesterol gallstone formation in human and mouse  <cit> . the specific role of osteopontin beyond its immune role in milk warrants further investigation. from a genetic perspective, it is well known that health and disease may affect other performance traits such as longevity and fertility among others. therefore, genetic factors affecting health trait may impact other traits. for bull fertility, the ebv for the male fertility index is reported as the non-return rate trait . among the genotyped bulls, we did not find significant statistical association of the four spp <dig> snp with the ebv of the non-return rate . even though osteopontin was reported to influence bull fertility  <cit> , these spp <dig> variants were not found associated with male fertility . we cannot exclude that a genetic association could be observed using bulls with extreme ebv for the male fertility index. therefore, further investigations are still required before suggesting favourable allele for the innate immune system, such as how the genetic spp <dig> variants may influence male fertility or milk composition . in fact, milk is used for human consumption and an increase of the concentration of cholesterol may not be valuable.

in the present study, we found a strong correlation between spp <dig> and scs, and we identified potential functional sites in the promoter of the gene. the different promoter haplotypes have been cloned, and the relevance of the functional sites will be studied in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the abundance of milk somatic cells in the holstein dairy population as well as to depict the immune response to environmental stimuli.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports the link between dna polymorphisms within the innate immune spp <dig> gene, the number of milk immune cells and, potentially, susceptibility to mastitis. indeed, one snp abolished the sp <dig> recognition site, whereas another snp affected the transcription binding factor ikaros. these snps, located in the promoter, are potentially involved in the th <dig> immune response and in the th <dig> regulation pathway since they were identified by in silico search to abolish these transcription factor recognition sites. because these snps are associated with the level of immune  cells measured in milk which is associated with clinical mastitis and because of their potential implication in the th1- th <dig>  all together, these findings suggest the genetic potential of these variants in terms of selection for improving mastitis resistance in dairy cows. but osteopontin is not only involved in regulatory mechanisms of the immune response but also in mammary gland development and milk secretion. thus, before recommending any spp <dig> haplotype for genetic selection, the beneficial role of these genetic forms would require further investigation.
