BACKGROUND
neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric solid tumor of the sympathetic nervous system deriving from ganglionic lineage precursors  <cit> . it is diagnosed during infancy and shows notable heterogeneity with regard to both histology and clinical behavior  <cit> , ranging from rapid progression associated with metastatic spread and poor clinical outcome to spontaneous, or therapy-induced, regression into benign ganglioneuroma  <cit> . age at diagnosis, international neuroblastoma staging system , histology, grade of differentiation, chromosomal aberrations, and amplification of the myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene neuroblastoma derived  are clinical and molecular risk factors  <cit>  commonly combined to classify patients into high, intermediate and low risk subgroups on which current therapeutic strategy is based  <cit> . although the survival of children with neuroblastoma improved over the last 25 years  <cit> , more than fifty percent of patients with adverse prognosis do not get benefit from treatment making the exploration of new therapeutic approaches and the identification of new potential targets mandatory  <cit> . patients with localized tumors have a more favorable outcome although the survival of stage  <dig> patients does not exceed 67 %  <cit> . the progression of localized tumors is closely associated to their growth rather than to their metastatic spread and understanding the molecular program at the time of diagnosis may be the key for improving the stratification and deciding the correct therapy.

the availability of neuroblastoma genomic profiles improved our prognostic ability. several groups have developed gene expression-based approaches to stratify neuroblastoma patients  and described prognostic gene signatures. we studied outcome prediction in neuroblastoma patients utilizing a biology-driven approach, in which the gene expression profile under investigation is associated to “a priori” knowledge of a biological process that has a major impact on tumor growth  <cit> . specifically, we studied the response of neuroblastoma to hypoxia and used this information to derive a novel prognostic signature  <cit> .

hypoxia, a condition of low oxygen tension occurring in poorly vascularized areas, has profound effects on tumor cell growth, genotype selection, susceptibility to apoptosis and resistance to radio- and chemotherapy, tumor angiogenesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and propagation of cancer stem cells . hypoxia activates specific genes encoding angiogenic, metabolic and metastatic factors  <cit>  and contributes to the acquisition of the tumor aggressive phenotype . we derived a 62-probe set neuroblastoma hypoxia signature   <cit>  and we demonstrated that nb-hypo is an independent risk factor for neuroblastoma patients  <cit> . the importance of hypoxia and hypoxia inducible genes in the progression, differentiation and spreading of neuroblastoma has been the subject of several reports .

here, we describe a robust classifier, based on nb-hypo, predicting neuroblastoma patients’ outcome with a very low error rate.

methods
patients
a total of  <dig> neuroblastoma patients belonging to four independent cohorts were enrolled on the basis of the availability of gene expression profile by affymetrix genechip hg-u133plus <dig>  and clinical and molecular information. eighty-eight patients were collected by the academic medical center   <cit> ;  <dig> patients were collected by the university children’s hospital, essen, germany and were treated according to the german neuroblastoma trials, either nb  <dig> or nb 2004;  <dig> patients were collected at hiroshima university hospital or affiliated hospitals and were treated according to the japanese neuroblastoma protocols  <cit> ;  <dig> patients were collected at gaslini institute and were treated according to associazione italiana ematologia e oncologia pediatrica  or international society of pediatric oncology europe neuroblastoma  protocols. the data are stored in the r <dig> repository  or in the bit-nb biobank of the gaslini institute. informed consent was obtained in accordance with institutional policies in use in each country. tumor samples were obtained before treatment at the time of diagnosis. median follow-up was longer than 5 years. tumor stage was defined according to the international neuroblastoma staging system  <cit> . we randomly divided the cohort in two groups of  <dig> and  <dig> patients. we utilized the expression data of  <dig> tumors in a leave-one-out analysis to select and construct the classifier and the expression data of the remaining  <dig> tumors constituted the external test dataset . the clinical characteristics of the  <dig> neuroblastoma tumors are detailed in table  <dig>  good and poor outcome were defined as patient’s status  5 years after diagnosis.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the procedures used to build the nb-hypo classifier. the gene expression of  <dig> neuroblastoma tumors was measured by microarray on affymetrix genechip hg-u133plus <dig> . the dataset was divided into training  and test  sets. ann model was applied to the training set in a  <dig> loops cross-validation scheme. the classifier was then applied to the test set. gsea evaluated the enrichment of hypoxia related gene sets in the groups defined by the nb-hypo classifier

gene expression analysis
gene expression profiles for the  <dig> tumors were obtained by microarray experiment using affymetrix genechip hg-u133plus <dig>   <cit>  and the data were processed by mas <dig>  software according affymetrix’ s guideline.

classifiers
multi-layer perceptron  is a feedforward artificial neural network . mlp was trained on the expression values of the  <dig> probe sets constituting nb-hypo signature  <cit>  to develop a predictive model for neuroblastoma patients’ outcome.

anns are organized in a number of input nodes, representing the attributes in the data, one or more hidden layers, where each layer is composed by a number of processing elements , and one or more output nodes representing the output of the network. the input nodes receive the input data as a vector of variables and this information is passed through to the units in the first hidden layer and processed by a set of associated weights. each hidden node calculates the output as follows  <cit> : vk=∑i=1nwkixi and yk=Φ where x
 <dig> …,
x
n are input variables, converging to the unit k. w

n are the weights connecting unit k. v
k is the net input. y
k is the output of the unit where v
k
 <dig> is a bias term and Φ is the activation function commonly of the form: Φv=11+e−v for the sigmoid activation function. ultimately, the modified information reaches the output nodes as output of the ann.

anns are trained to be capable of accurately modeling a set of examples and predicting their output  <cit> . the backpropagation training algorithm is a computationally straightforward algorithm for training the multi-layer perceptron  <cit> , which uses the gradient descent procedure to find the combination of weights, resulting in the smallest error  <cit> . a learning rate controls the size of the weights changes and a momentum term prevents the network in becoming trapped in local minima, or being stuck along flat regions in error space  <cit> . regularization techniques are applied to prevent the risk of low generalization ability  <cit> . one commonly used regularization technique stops the training process when a predetermined number of iterations have completed.

we set up a three-layer neural network architecture containing a single hidden layer with  <dig> hidden units. the number of hidden units is calculated as the fraction between, the sum of the number of probe sets and the number of outcomes, and two. the activation function of the hidden layer units was the sigmoid function. we scaled data for improving the performance of the network. we utilized the back-propagation process with learning rate and momentum set to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the predetermined maximum number of iterations was set to  <dig> 

the support vector machine   <cit> , the logistic regression   <cit> , and the naïve bayesian   <cit>  algorithms were also utilized for classification. libsvm implementation of svm was ran with homogeneous polynomial kernel, degree of the polynomials set to  <dig>  gamma parameter set to  <dig>  and tolerance of the termination criterion set to  <dig> .we ran nab with no supervised discretization and no kernel estimator for numeric attributes and lor with ridge parameter set to  <dig> e- <dig> and broyden–fletcher–goldfarb–shanno  regularization.

the algorithms were implemented by the waikato environment for knowledge analysis  software version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

metrics
let tp to be the number of true positives, tn the number of true negatives, fp the number of false positives and fn the number of false negatives in a confusion matrix, we defined good outcome as positive and poor outcome as the negative.

accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity, negative predictive value , matthew’s correlation coefficient  and f1-score metrics measured the performance of the classifier.

accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified patients  <cit>  and it is calculated by the formula: accuracy=tp+tntp+fp+tn+fn 


sensitivity, also named true positive rate or recall, measures the proportion of good outcome patients correctly classified as such  <cit>  and it is calculated by the formula: sensitivity=tptp+fn 


precision measures the proportion of correctly classified good outcome patients  <cit>  and it is calculated by the formula: precision=tptp+fp 


specificity measures the proportion of poor outcome patients correctly classified as such  <cit>  and it is calculated by the formula: specificity=tntn+fp 


npv measures the proportion of correctly classified poor outcome patients. npv is calculated by the formula: npv=tntn+fn 


mcc measures the correlation between a classifier prediction and the observed outcomes. we calculated mcc by the formula: mcc=tp*tn−fp*fntp+fptp+fntn+fptn+fn 


when mcc equals  <dig>  the performance is comparable with that of a random prediction.

f1-score measures the weighted average of the precision and sensitivity. we calculated the f1-score by the formula: f1−score=2precision∗sensitivityprecision+sensitivity 


statistical analysis
we estimated the probability of overall survival  and event-free survival  using the kaplan-meier method, and we measured the significance of the difference between kaplan-meier curves by log-rank test using prism  <dig>  . independence among the clinical variables and nb-hypo prediction was assessed by multivariate cox analysis. mycn status, inss stage and age at diagnosis were included in the analysis as binary variables.

gene set enrichment analysis
we utilized the gsea  <cit>  to evaluate the enrichment of hypoxia related gene sets in patients predicted with “poor” or “good” outcome. we carried out the analysis on all probe sets of the hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  genechip. gsea calculates an enrichment score  and normalized enrichment score  for each gene set and estimates the statistical significance of the nes by an empirical permutation test using  <dig>  gene permutations to obtain the nominal p-value. however, when multiple gene sets are evaluated, gsea adjusts the estimate of the significance level to account for multiple hypothesis testing. to this end, gsea computes the false discovery rate q-value  measuring the estimated probability that the normalized enrichment score represents a false positive finding  <cit> . the gene sets used in the analysis belong to the chemical and genetic perturbation  collection of the molecular signature database  v <dig> database  <cit> . we selected  <dig> gene sets related to the hypoxia response from the c <dig> cgp collection using “hypoxia” as keyword and containing between  <dig> and  <dig> probe sets . fdr q-value smaller than  <dig>  is considered significant.

RESULTS
we analyzed the gene expression of  <dig> neuroblastoma tumors profiled by the affymetrix hg-u133plus <dig>  platform  <cit> . the clinical characteristics of the  <dig> neuroblastoma patients are detailed in the table  <dig>  “good” or “poor” outcome is defined, from here on, as the patient’s status “alive” or “dead” 5 years after diagnosis, respectively. we randomly divided the cohort into two groups of  <dig>  and  <dig>  patients to create the training and test set, respectively . we utilized the expression data of the training set to construct the classifier and the leave-one-out approach to measure the performance of the algorithms. the classifier was then tested on the independent  <dig> patients dataset. we previously described a  <dig> probe sets signature that represents the hypoxic response of neuroblastoma cell lines  <cit>   and we used this signature to develop a hypoxia-based classifier to predict the patients’ outcome .

to this end, we compared the performances of multi-layer perceptron , support vector machine , logistic regression , and naïve bayesian  algorithms in classifying neuroblastoma patients’ outcome. we evaluated the classification by measuring accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity, negative predictive value, matthew’s correlation coefficient and f1-score indicators by leave-one-out cross validation. the results  showed that mlp performed similarly or better than the other algorithms tested depending on the indicator and mlp was chosen to generate the nb-hypo classifier.

we tested the mlp classifier on an independent test set of  <dig> neuroblastoma patients and we found that it predicted correctly 53/ <dig>  good outcome and 18/ <dig>  poor outcome patients, resulting in an accuracy of 87 % .

we compared the performance of nb-hypo classifier with that of the known neuroblastoma risk factors: age at diagnosis, inss stage and mycn status by subdividing the patients of the test set according to these risk factors and calculating the prediction performances . nb-hypo classifier achieved the highest predictive accuracy  and mcc  compared to the other risk factors . mycn status had the highest sensitivity and npv, but the lowest specificity and precision whereas age at diagnosis showed the opposite trend indicating strong phenotype biases of these risk factors. in contrast, nb-hypo classifier and inss stage obtained a more balanced specificity and sensitivity indicating a less biased classification error distribution between good and poor outcome. nb-hypo classifier and mycn had the highest f1-score indicating the good balance of sensitivity and precision of these two factors.table  <dig> nb patients classification by different risk factors

we assessed the concordance between nb-hypo prediction and patients’ characteristics . we divided the patients by inss stage reporting for each group the outcome prediction by nb-hypo classifier, the concordance between the prediction and the outcome, age at diagnosis and mycn status. interestingly, we found the good 98 % concordance  between patient’s outcome and prediction in localized  and stage 4s tumors indicating that nb-hypo has 2 % classification error in non-stage  <dig> patients. this result is particularly interesting because the prediction was accurate in assessing the uncommon death of  <dig> low or intermediated risk patients. among the correctly predicted patients, age at diagnosis and mycn amplification status were evenly distributed , demonstrating the independence between these risk factors and the nb-hypo classifier and in agreement with results shown in table  <dig>  in contrast, the majority of misclassified patients belonged to stage  <dig>  in agreement with the fact that prognosis of this stage is traditionally difficult  <cit> . taken together, these results demonstrate that nb-hypo classifier is a powerful tool to predict neuroblastoma patients’ outcome.fig.  <dig> the plot shows the concordance between nb-hypo prediction and the clinical characteristics of the  <dig> patients in the external test dataset. patients are grouped according to inss staging. rows represent individual patients. for each stage, the column “prediction” indicates the prediction results of nb-hypo classifier . the column “correct” represents the correctness of nb-hypo classifier prediction . the column “age” shows the age at diagnosis . the column “mycn” shows the mycn amplification status . patients marked with a clearer color are the ones predicted as “poor” by nb-hypo classifier




we analyzed the hypoxic status of the tumors utilizing the gene set enrichment analysis   <cit> . we utilized gsea to determine whether known sets of hypoxia-inducible genes were significantly enriched in the tumor gene expression profile in relationship to the “poor” or “good” outcome prediction. we studied  <dig> gene sets characteristic of the hypoxia response according to the literature and included in the gsea msigdb database . these gene sets were independently derived by other groups to assess the hypoxic status of various tissues different from neuroblastoma. eleven hypoxia gene sets were significantly enriched in the patients classified as “dead” , whereas none was enriched in those classified as “alive”, demonstrating association between the poor outcome and the hypoxic status of the tumor . we concluded that poor prognosis patients have a hypoxic phenotype.table  <dig> hypoxia-related gene sets enriched in patients classified as poor outcome

discussion
we developed a classifier based on tumor gene expression that predicts neuroblastoma patients’ outcome with high accuracy. we utilized a bottom up, biology-driven, approach  <cit> , which is based on the prior knowledge of the influence of tumor hypoxia on neuroblastoma growth. one advantage of this strategy is the immediate appreciation of the molecular program related to the prognostic indication  <cit> . this process followed a rigorous sequence starting from the definition of neuroblastoma hypoxic response signature in tumor cell lines  <cit>  followed by the demonstration that this signature is an independent risk factor  <cit>  and the findings, reported here, that the mlp, applied to the  <dig> probe sets of the signature generates a robust outcome and tumor hypoxia predictor with potential clinical applications.

the importance of hypoxia in conditioning tumor aggressiveness is documented by an extensive literature . studies on the relationship between hypoxia inducible factors and neuroblastoma aggressiveness showed that high hif- <dig> alpha expression correlated with disseminated disease . however, there is little information on the potential of hypoxia as a biomarker for patients’ stratification possibly because it is difficult of quantifying hypoxia, patchy in nature, in a tumor mass  <cit> . microarray technology, applied to tumors, has the potential to overcome this difficulty and to provide a probe to monitor average hypoxia in the tumor mass  <cit> . the use of gene expression signatures to measure hypoxia has been reported  <cit>  and their potential as prognostic factors was shown, for example, in soft tissues sarcomas  <cit>  and hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> .

several statistical and machine learning techniques can be used for classification  <cit> . here, we described the successful application of the multi-layer perceptron for nb patients’ outcome prediction. mlps are a form of machine learning with proven pattern recognition capabilities that were utilized in many areas of bioinformatics such as disease classification and identification of biomarkers  <cit> . mlp demonstrated a similar/better performance relative to svm, nab and lor algorithms proving to be a robust tool for the analysis of complex gene expression data.

utilizing the mlp algorithm with the nb-hypo signature previously described  <cit> , we generated a robust and independent classifier capable of stratifying patients with distinct overall and event-free survival and predicting patients’ good or poor outcome with 87 % accuracy of and 67 % mcc. these values are better than what can be achieved with other available risk factors  on the same cohort. these findings extend and complement previous work on nb patients’ classifiers based on logic learning machine   <cit>  trained through an optimized version of the shadow clustering algorithm  <cit> . these studies were instrumental to demonstrate that hypoxia based predictors could generate intelligible rules translatable into the clinical settings  <cit> . however, the feature selection system of llm reshaped the feature space definition for optimizing the rule construction and only a fraction of the nb-hypo probe sets was tested in these studies. the present work provides novel and critical evidence that the  <dig> probe sets of the nb-hypo signature will work as a whole, providing robustness to the classifier generated by application of the multi-layer perceptron algorithm.

several groups have used gene expression-based approaches to stratify neuroblastoma patients and prognostic gene signatures have been described . the performance of our nb-hypo classifier is comparable with that of the other prognostic gene expression signatures proposed for neuroblastoma  <cit> . however, some of them were obtained by supervised computational methods applied to the entire gene expression profile of primary tumors or by meta-analysis of existing data. these approaches generated interesting results but the signatures, and the resulting classifiers, have some limitations. on one hand, these gene signatures have little overlap because of the high variability of the tumor data sets. on the other, it is difficult to interpret the results with respect to the underlying biology because the assembly of the signature is purely mathematical. finding a predictor that can be linked to molecular mechanisms of cancer development is critical for translating these markers to the clinic. one added value of our predictor is that the choice of a biology driven approach links our tumor selection to the hypoxia molecular program that can be associated to the progress of the disease and exploited to manage the neuroblastoma.

when we evaluated the concordance between nb-hypo prediction and inss stage, we found that nb-hypo correctly predicted the status of almost all patients with localized or 4s stage tumors. more importantly, we identified, in this group, all patients with poor outcome that may benefit from a more aggressive, and perhaps hypoxia related treatment. validation of this conclusion on additional data sets is required.

the suggestion of developing hypoxia-related treatments relies on the demonstration that poor outcome tumors are hypoxic. the expression of the nb-hypo signature is the first line of evidence in this respect. the gsea analysis was an independent strategy to explore the relationship between nb-hypo outcome prediction and tumor hypoxia because it is based on the analysis of all forty thousand probe sets of the tumor expression profile. gsea measures the representation of hypoxia-related gene sets coming from independent, published studies in the good or poor prognosis patients. we demonstrated a great and selective enrichment of hypoxia related gene sets in a large group of poor outcome patients.

the characterization of the tumor at diagnosis is indispensable for deciding the treatment and the nb-hypo classifier poor outcome prediction may identify the tumors that, as a result of the hypoxic status, express high genetic instability  <cit> , contain undifferentiated or cancer stem cells  <cit>  or a higher metastatic potential  <cit> . therapeutic agents are being developed to target hypoxia  and are being tested in the clinic. our classifier may be instrumental for their application to neuroblastoma.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a robust classifier predicting neuroblastoma patient’s outcome with a very low error rate and we provided independent evidence that the poor outcome tumors are hypoxic, supporting the potential of using hypoxia as target for neuroblastoma treatment. the definitive validation of hypoxia as a prognostic factor in clinical trials rests on the possibility to analyze a larger dataset to validate the existence of small group of patients, with unique clinical history, in which tumor hypoxia may be the driving force to poor outcome. we will look at the potential of cross platform approaches to compare and utilize existing neuroblastoma gene expression dataset obtained with different platforms. this task is not easy but it is feasible and promises to assemble a significant number of cases for improving the predictive value of hypoxia-related signatures in neuroblastoma.

a second way to boost the robustness of the prediction is to increase the spectrum of molecular data associated to the patient. ribonucleic acid  assessment by microarray analysis is becoming an affordable and reliable method to characterize hypoxia response. however, micrornas, non coding rna, protein patterns, transcription factors analysis, promise to generate equally important information to define the biology of tumor hypoxia. the full exploitation of this wealth of data will require a parallel bioinformatics effort to develop the relevant multiplatform pathway analysis and studies along this way are in progress.
