BACKGROUND
ustilago maydis is a ubiquitous pathogen of zea mays  that can cause tremendous economic losses  <cit> . the most conspicuous symptom of the smut disease u. maydis causes is a fungus-induced tumour containing dark diploid teliospores. the spores disperse and germinate to produce saprophytic haploid cells. compatible haploids fuse to form the filamentous dikaryon that penetrates the plant initiating a new round of infection.

u. maydis has been developed as a model for fungal plant pathogenesis because it is readily cultured in the laboratory and is amenable to genetic analysis and molecular manipulation. a draft sequence of the  <dig>  mb genome was released in  <dig>  <cit>  and a physical map of the  <dig> chromosomes was assembled using bacterial artificial chromosome clones  <cit> . full utilization of the genome sequence requires its thorough annotation. critical to this annotation are the determination of transcript sequences, and an indication of when transcripts are expressed. the work described here produced cdna sequence information for genome annotation and was carried out in the context of investigating u. maydis response to nutrient limitation and aspects of u. maydis transcript structure that provide insight into the control of gene expression. the data obtained will strengthen the model and may provide insight that allows us to combat fungal pathogens in the field.

a critical aspect of pathogenic development by u. maydis is sensing and responding to nutrient availability and other signals from the host  <cit> ; yet the mechanism of control is not known. a widely conserved aspect of nitrogen metabolism in fungi is nitrogen catabolite repression . during ncr in fungal species such as saccharomyces cerevisiae, neurospora crassa and aspergillus nidulans, the presence of a preferential nitrogen source such as ammonia acts to suppress expression of enzymes that utilize other, less preferred, nitrogen sources  <cit> . during de-repression, the genes involved in metabolizing alternate nitrogen sources were induced when the preferred nitrogen source is absent and a specific alternate source is present  <cit> . the expression pattern results from a two step control mechanism coordinated by both global  and pathway-specific transcription factors . in the rice blast pathogen magnaporthe grisea the nit2/area-like master regulator is dispensable for pathogenesis but is required for full expression of the pathogenesis gene mpg <dig>  <cit>  and deletion of a gata transcription factor in the bean pathogen colletotrichum lindemuthianum severely reduces its pathogenesis  <cit> . further evidence for the link between nitrogen metabolism and pathogenesis has come via genetic analysis of m. grisea that identified two genes that were regulators of ncr and pathogenesis  <cit> . microarray hybridization experiments indicated m. grisea genes expressed during nitrogen limitation were also expressed during in planta growth  <cit> . together, these discoveries suggest that, like other plant pathogens, control of nitrogen metabolism in u. maydis may have implications for pathogenesis, thus analysis of gene expression in nitrogen limiting conditions is relevant to pathogenesis as well as genome annotation.

as a further aid to genome annotation, analysis of transcript sequences also identifies introns and variation in intron splicing. alternative pre-mrna splicing is recognized as a significant contributor to proteome diversity in "higher" metazoans, with an estimated  <dig> % of human genes giving rise to alternately spliced transcripts  <cit> . in contrast, among the fungi, only m. grisea and cryptococcus neoformans have been subject to genome-scale assessment of alternative pre-mrna splicing  <cit> . the examination of expressed sequence tag  libraries from several m. grisea strains identified  <dig> instances of alternative splicing among  <dig>  unique expressed sequences . in this m. grisea analysis, intron retention accounted for the vast majority of the alternate splicing events. the annotation of the c. neoformans genome sequence  <cit> , noted  <dig> examples of alternative splicing among  <dig> , predicted gene models . among the alternative splicing events noted for c. neoformans, were numerous examples of exon skipping and alternative splice site selection. investigating what types of alternate splicing occur in u. maydis will provide information for genome annotation and for assessing the diversity of alternate splicing in the fungi.

there is some knowledge of the diversity in expression of antisense rnas among fungi. in schizosaccharomyces pombe, small antisense transcripts are produced through a conserved mechanism and function in heterochromatin organization and cell division  <cit>  and in n. crassa small antisense rnas are involved in quelling and classic rna inhibition   <cit> . however, s. cerevisiae lacks the main components of the rnai machinery  <cit>  and no classic examples of rnai have been reported for this fungus. in contrast, there is evidence of a non-classical gene suppression mechanism involving rnas complementary to the 5' untranslated region  in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  therefore, the types of small antisense transcripts that are involved in controlling gene expression during transcription, splicing, mrna degradation, gene silencing and imprinting in an evolutionarily broad range of organisms  are not present in all fungi. this suggests that, for fungi lacking the classic rnai machinery, there may be other mechanisms for controlling these processes. comparative genomics analyses showed that u. maydis also lacks the main components of the rnai machinery  <cit> . furthermore, antisense rna was shown to be unable to suppress gene expression in u. maydis  <cit> . however, the presence of natural antisense transcripts has not been investigated. the identification of antisense rnas in u. maydis would aid genome annotation and may provide insight into mechanism of controlling gene expression not described for other eukaryotes.

previous u. maydis est libraries  <cit>  were utilized in the original automated annotation of the draft genome sequence by the broad institute  <cit> . the goals of the current work were three fold: 1) to aid in thorough genome annotation  <cit> , 2) to determine differences in transcript abundance of genes expressed under nitrogen and carbon starvation and 3) to conduct structural analyses of transcripts aimed at the identification of alternate splicing and antisense transcription in u. maydis.

RESULTS
morphological and growth rate changes associated with nutrient limitation
examination of nutrient starved u. maydis haploid cells showed a distinct difference in the response to nitrogen and carbon limitation . the cells appear to actively adapt allowing for growth and division in the absence of exogenous nitrogen. when the haploids were transferred from cm to minus nitrogen media , the rate of growth, in each of three replicates, decreased and reached a stationary phase earlier than haploids maintained in complete media  or minimal media . the cells grown in minus nitrogen media were also highly vacuolated relative to those growing in cm, mm or minus carbon media  suggesting that changes in cytology as well as physiology were part of this adaptation . in contrast, the haploids grown in mc appear to stop mitotic division and were not distinct from cells grown in cm or mm .

sequences analysis, contig assembly and gene assignment
four cdna libraries were constructed using total rna from u. maydis dormant teliospores , pooled from several infected corn plants, and mrna from haploid cells grown in cm, mn and mc. a total of  <dig>  sequencing reactions were performed, the td, mn and cm libraries contributed  <dig>  reactions each and the mc library the remaining  <dig>  reactions. after quality assessment, a total of  <dig>  ests were generated with an average size of  <dig> bp. the blastn algorithm was used to search the ests against the ustilago maydis genome sequence assembly  <cit> ,  <dig>  ests produced a significant alignment .

the ests that aligned to the genome were assembled into  <dig>  contigs based on genome location. the average genomic length of a contig was  <dig> bp. ests that overlapped or were adjacent to each other were combined into a contig. the accuracy of contig assembly was increased by the addition of  <dig>  ests from the germinating teliospores and the filamentous diploid libraries  <cit> . based on the mean number of ests/contig the td and mn libraries were the least redundant .

a predicted gene set that was compiled by the munich information center for protein sequences  consists of the broad institute's autocalled gene set, mips own predicted genes, and formerly identified genes. the analyses herein were based on the february  <dig> version of the gene set. assembled contigs were assigned a predicted gene identity based on genome location as described in the methods. of the  <dig>  contigs assembled,  <dig>  contigs were assigned to  <dig>  unique mumdb genes. the  <dig> remaining contigs aligned to the genome sequence but not to regions corresponding to mumdb genes;  <dig> out of the  <dig> contigs were anti-sense . only  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> contigs produced a significant alignment when searched against the ncbi non-redundant database using the blastx algorithm. of the  <dig> matches,  <dig> were to old u. maydis predicted genes that have now been either discarded or re-model by mips manual annotation. the remaining five aligned to hypothetical, putative, or conserved hypothetical proteins of other fungi.

the new libraries  contribute a total of  <dig>  contigs of which  <dig>   were not represented in published libraries. among the new libraries, those constructed using haploid cells  contributed  <dig>  contigs while td contributes  <dig> contigs and  <dig> contigs were common to td and the haploid libraries . distribution of the contigs within the haploid cell libraries indicates that mn has the most contigs present only in this growth condition and absent from others  while mc has the least . there were  <dig> contigs representing transcripts found in all  <dig> libraries  that could represent members of a core gene set for u. maydis. a core gene set is a group of genes that are absolutely required for an organism to complete its life cycle. about a third of these contigs were ribosomal proteins. the  <dig> contigs were searched against the s. cerevisiae gene set  <cit> ,  <dig> contigs aligned and  <dig> of these to essential genes. furthermore, there were  <dig> contigs whose functions were assigned as conserved hypothetical or hypothetical proteins,  <dig> putative proteins and four contigs that were not assigned a function. contigs that did not align to s. cerevisiae genes were also searched against the non-redundant database of ncbi, using the blastx algorithm and no matches were found; suggesting these  <dig> contigs may represent taxon specific genes.

functional characterization
the contigs were grouped into functional categories based on the funcat system proposed by mips  <cit> . at the time of this analysis,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  mumdb genes had a funcat assignment. correspondingly,  <dig> functionally categorized genes were represented in this work by  <dig>  contigs. the distribution of the funcat categories for the haploid libraries and the td library, based on contig and est numbers, were determined. the percentage of expressed genes assigned to functional categories was similar for all the libraries; however, the exact composition of the genes in a category varies . furthermore, the differences in the number of ests per category suggest that transcript abundance within a category varies among the four libraries .

differential expression
to screen for contigs for which there were differentially abundant transcripts, r statistics  <cit>  were calculated based on est representation in the four libraries. a list of  <dig> contigs with the highest r statistical values was generated for further analysis . there were eight contigs that do not have a known function, six were mumdb proteins and two were not similar to characterized proteins . the last two may represent u. maydis-specific genes. seven contigs where comprised entirely of ests from the dormant teliospores library. eight contigs  were chosen for reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr  to investigate the differential transcript abundance predicted by r statistics analysis . rt-qpcr reactions were performed on rna isolated from haploid cells grown under different nutritional conditions along with rna from the dormant teliospores. results confirm the differential transcript abundance predicted by the r statistics in the instances where the libraries compared were constructed by the same method .

list of contigs representing genes identified as differentially regulated. mips gene functions were also included. genes investigated by rt-qpcr were in bold. genes denoted by an asterisk were involved in nitrogen metabolism.

differential transcript abundance of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism was also investigated by rt-qpcr. three of the eight contigs that were examined for confirmation of the r statistic predictive value were up regulated in the nitrogen starved library . the transcript abundance of these genes, as well as that of four other nitrogen metabolism genes represented in the libraries , was investigated in  <dig> biological replicates of the haploid cells and teliospores pooled from different infected plants following two independent series of inoculations. during this investigation haploid cells grown in minimal media  were included as a control since mn and mc were derivatives of mm. the rt-qpcr results displayed the pattern of transcript abundance predicted from the r statistic analysis . in addition, for all nitrogen metabolism genes investigated, the results showed that the abundance of transcript was similar in mn and mm but reduced in mc. results that suggest carbon availability has a role in controlling nitrogen metabolism gene transcript abundance since mm and mc had the same nitrogen source and concentration but differed in carbon source availability.

transcript structure generation
the alignment of  <dig>  5' ests to their cognate genomic loci resulted in the identification of  <dig>  predicted gene locations or pgls. alignments carried out in this manner provided an independent prediction of potential gene locations and not all pgls corresponded to the mumdb orfs. on average, each pgl was represented by  <dig>  ests; although, the majority  were represented by only a single est. positional assignment of the pgls to mumdb genes showed that  <dig>   can be unambiguously paired to  <dig>  mumdb genes, while  <dig>  do not correspond to a predicted gene. as such, a definitive estimate of the proportion of u. maydis genes represented by the  <dig> pgls was not possible; however, it is at least  <dig> %  of the genes in mumdb.

note that the majority of the gene structures generated by geneseqer were expected to be partial; reflecting the 5' limitation of the ests upon which they were based . where relevant, the implications of this bias will be addressed.

identification of alternative splicing events
geneseqer assigned single gene structures to  <dig>  of the  <dig>  pgls that were initially identified. the remaining  <dig> pgls were assigned at least  <dig> structures; an observation that suggests multiple mrna isoforms originate from these loci. direct examination using mygv  <dig>   <cit>  resulted in the identification of  <dig> pgls for which strict est/genome alignments supported the existence of more than one mrna isoform. the assignment of more than one gene structure to a given pgl was taken as preliminary evidence of the alternative splicing of these loci.

the number of gene structures assigned to each of the  <dig> alternatively spliced pgls ranged from  <dig> –  <dig>  the  <dig> pgls represent  <dig>  % of the  <dig>  identified by geneseqer. however, it should be noted that only  <dig> of the original pgls contained at least one intron and were supported by multiple ests: characteristics that were required for the detection of alternative splicing. of this subset,  <dig> % had evidence of alternative splicing. the pgls with evidence of alternative splicing as well as the corresponding mumdb genes were presented in additional file  <dig> 

categorization of alternative splicing events
having detected alternate splicing in u. maydis the structures predicted for each pgl were further analysed to determine, where possible, the nature of each alternate splicing event. two issues became evident during this analysis: 1) the 5-prime limitation of the ests often meant that the nature of alternative splicing events may be ambiguous , and 2) there was difficulty in distinguishing between alternative splicing and multiple transcriptional start sites in some cases. in both instances, the pgl in question was considered alternatively spliced, but was not categorized . among the  <dig> pgls, there was sufficient information to unambiguously categorize  <dig>  examples of all varieties of alternative splicing were present; however, the majority consisted of intron retention events.

ests containing "retained" introns may arise by contamination of the rna starting material with genomic dna  or the presence of unprocessed transcripts. contaminating gdna was eliminated by selective rna isolation and dnase treatment . the efficacy of these measures was assessed, prior to library construction, using rt-pcr amplification directed at the detection of unspliced transcripts of the u. maydis glycogen synthase kinase gene . under all nutrient conditions and for all cell types, no gdna contamination was detected. therefore, gdna contamination cannot account for those ests containing retained introns. the rt-pcr screen also indicated that no unprocessed ugk transcripts were present in the mrnas used for library construction; confirming that the intron retention identified was legitimate and not a transcript captured before splicing had occurred. however, as different genes may have different rates of mrna processing the ugk screen may not reflect the state of all transcripts represented in the library and it was conceivable that some proportion of the ests may be derived from unprocessed pre-mrnas. as such, all transcript structures containing retained introns were subcategorized to reflect the relative confidence that the intron was retained in a mature mrna . the categories were as follows: single est ir – intron retention was implied by only a single est, multiple est ir – intron retention was implied by multiple ests, and processed ir – an intron was retained in a transcript structure that also showed successful splicing of another intron. a summary of the categorization is presented in table  <dig> 

while the number of alternatively spliced pgls that could be unambiguously characterized was  <dig>  many of these were subject to more than one splicing event and, in this tabulation, each splicing event was counted.

a comparison of the u. maydis genes for which there is evidence of alternate splicing to the genes identified as being alternatively spliced in c. neoformans, indicates nine genes that are similar . the u. maydis  are: um <dig> , um <dig> , um02412/ <dig> , um <dig> , um <dig> , um <dig> , um <dig> , um11210/um <dig> , and um <dig> . one of these genes, isocitrate dehydrogenase  has also been identified as being alternatively spliced by mumdb. um <dig> is predicted to be the cytosolic enzyme and um <dig> the alternately spliced mitochondrial form. isocitrate dehydrogenase has also been shown to be alternately spliced in humans  <cit> . in both humans and u. maydis the result of alternate splicing is an alteration in the n terminal exon of the gene. more data is required to determine the similarity in splice junctions.

in order to provide some evidence in support of alternate splicing apart from the est analysis rt-pcr amplifications were carried out from two biological replicates of each cell type. the results are presented in additional file  <dig> and a diagrammatic representation of the predicted alternate splicing events in additional file  <dig>  note that additional file  <dig> only represents the portion of the transcript affected by the alternate splicing and does not reflect transcript start or stop sites. in additional file  <dig> separate gels are aligned so that separate amplifications from the same template cdna appear in the same lane. primers were selected to amplify regions that would vary in size if the alternate gene structures or agss predicted in silico were present as transcripts. four transcript structures were predicted for um <dig> . the structures are the results of alternative acceptor selection , intron excision , retention of a single intron , and retention of two introns . the predicted amplicons for the four agss of um <dig> were 1)  <dig> bp, 2)  <dig> bp, 3)  <dig> bp, and 4)  <dig> bp. amplification of the genomic dna would yield a  <dig> bp fragment. structure  <dig> had the most est support and an amplicon corresponding in size to that predicted by this structure is the brightest stained band in all lanes except in the amplification from genomic dna . a band corresponding in size to that predicted for structure  <dig> is visible in the cm, mn, td and dip lanes where as a band corresponding to structure  <dig> is visible in the mc lane. no band corresponding to structure  <dig> was detected; however, this structure was predicted based on ests from the germinating teliospores library constructed previously and this condition was not included in the rt-pcr experiment. a band, of approximately  <dig> bp, not predicted from the ests analyzed for um <dig>  was present in the dip lanes. for the gene um10506/ <dig> two agss were predicted, the structures illustrating this are shown in additional file  <dig>  structure  <dig> had the greater est support, it would yield an amplicon of  <dig> bp and structure  <dig> would yield an amplicon of  <dig> bp. both amplicons are present in all lanes except the gd lane. faint bands of slower mobility than that corresponding to the ags <dig> amplicon are also present in some lanes. no ests consistent with these amplicons were analyzed. for um <dig> three structures were predicted, these would be represented by amplicons of  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively. the first two amplicons were not resolved on the gel picture included. for the gene um <dig> two agss were predicted and dna amplicons consistent in size with these were detected, amplicons were, for structure  <dig> –  <dig> bp and structure  <dig> –  <dig> bp. finally the control um  <dig>  ugk, has been confirmed to have a single intron which is constituently spliced  and amplicons produced are consistent in size with the excision of this intron. in summary the results show the presence of multiple transcript isoforms, the majority of which are consistent with the alternately spliced mrnas predicted by est analysis, and provided evidence for the cell type or nutrient response specific production of mrna species.

characteristics of u. maydis introns
in addition to detecting pgls with evidence of alternative splicing, the gene structures generated by geneseqer identified est-supported introns. while there exists a manually refined, software generated, collection of u. maydis gene models, this analysis was restricted to those introns supported by ests. the restriction to est supported introns allowed the identification of those subject to alternative splicing to be distinguished from those that, based on available evidence, were constitutively spliced.

the  <dig> pgls for which there is preliminary evidence of alternative splicing were separated from the original  <dig> prior to the assembly and analysis of the intron dataset. subsequently constitutively spliced introns were compared with those subject to alternative splicing. among the remaining  <dig>  pgls,  <dig>  introns were identified in  <dig> pgls. the number of introns per pgl ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  though the majority  <dig> contained only a single intron. of the  <dig>  introns identified,  <dig> introns were discarded based on length and  <dig> did not bear the accepted splice site dinucleotides . the est/genome alignments supporting these  <dig> introns were examined ; this showed that  <dig> were the result of mis-alignment and/or sequencing errors while the remaining  <dig> appeared to be genuine introns. thus, the filtered dataset consisted of  <dig> introns,  <dig> that bore non-canonical splice site dinucleotides.

the presence of  <dig>  introns among the  <dig>  pgls corresponded to a frequency of  <dig>  introns/pgl. while the 5' limitation of the ests precludes any interpretation of this frequency on a "per gene" basis, the observed frequency does not differ markedly from the  <dig>  that was arrived at using manually curated gene models  <cit> . the est supported introns ranged in size from  <dig> –  <dig>  nts, with a mean of  <dig>  nts. a frequency histogram of the intron lengths is presented in additional file  <dig> 

putative branch sites could be identified in  <dig>  of the  <dig>  introns that passed filtering and bore canonical splice sites. sequence logos based on the alignments of the intron/exon borders and the putative branch points were presented in figure 5a.

characteristics of retained introns
a collection of  <dig>  well supported , retained introns was analyzed using the same methodology as that employed in the analysis of constitutively spliced introns. the retained introns ranged in length from  <dig> –  <dig> with a mean of  <dig> nts. none of the introns were removed from the analysis based on size but  <dig>  did not contain acceptable splice site dinucleotides. the est/genome alignments supporting these introns were examined and none were found to be the result of alignment or sequencing errors. putative branch points could be identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> introns that bore canonical splice sites. sequence logos based on the alignments of the splice sites and branch point were presented in figure 5b. comparison of figures 5a and 5b indicate that the sequence features of the retained introns were more degenerate than those that were constitutively spliced.

anti sense transcript analysis
anti-sense transcripts were identified as contigs that aligned to the non-coding strand of a mumdb gene. a total of  <dig> mumdb genes, corresponding to  <dig> contigs, have anti-sense transcripts represented in the est libraries. the presence of anti sense transcripts for  <dig> genes was supported by a single est, where as  <dig> were supported by  <dig> ests and  <dig> were supported by  <dig> or more ests . many of the genes with antisense ests were also represented by sense ests in the libraries. . manual analysis assisted by spidey  <cit> , was performed on seven genes represented by multiple anti sense and sense ests. one of the seven genes analyzed, um <dig>  was represented by three anti sense ests from the mn library and three sense ests from the cm library . pcr was performed on either the sense or anti sense strand cdna that was produced using strand specific primers. the rt-pcr results confirm the presence of that both anti-sense and sense transcripts in two independent pooled cultures of cm and mn grown haploid cells .

genes were described fully in additional file 5

discussion
growth and cellular response to nutrient starvation
when u. maydis haploid cultures were transferred from cm to mn media, the rate of growth decreased and the cells became vacuolated, a process that may be evolutionarily related to the autophagic response of candida albicans and s. cerevisiae to nitrogen limitation  <cit> . in contrast to nitrogen starvation, the carbon starvation response appears to be marked by the cessation of cell division, but no obvious morphological changes . the visible responses of u. maydis to nutrient starvation were associated with changes in gene transcript abundance allowing us to use these responses to identify novel genes, advance the knowledge of transcript structure and contribute information to aid annotation of the genome.

contig assembly and functional annotation
the assembly of contigs based on the co-ordinates of an est's genome location has two advantages over the approach used in earlier studies . contigs identified in this work correspond to  <dig> %  of the mumdb orfs . apart from these,  <dig> contigs corresponded to the genome but not to a mumdb gene or an anti-sense strand variant,  <dig> of these corresponded to u. maydis genes that were predicted by previous annotation programs  <cit>  but were rejected in more recent annotation models; this suggests that the current annotation requires continued updating and for this reason these data have been shared with mips. the remaining contigs did not have significant similarity to characterized protein or rna coding genes suggesting they represent formerly unidentified u. maydis genes.

the ests representing transcripts not previously sequenced  <cit> , were assembled into  <dig>  contigs; a significant increase in genes represented by ests that was facilitated by the relatively small overlap between the libraries . forty three percent of the predicted genes represented in the libraries were assigned to functional categories using the funcat system of mips  <cit> , this compares to  <dig> % for the entire u. maydis gene set. the presence of distinct transcript profiles in separate libraries underlines the distinct cellular responses exhibited under different growth conditions and between haploid cells and diploid teliospores. the functional annotation provides insight into the nature of these differences.

the td library was created from 'dormant' teliospores, and, as such, there was an expectation that transcript abundance would be low and that transcripts would be evenly distributed among the funcat categories. however, the td library has a relatively high percentage of ests in the metabolism, cell rescue/defence and virulence categories. for example, um <dig>  a gene related to adh ii an alcohol dehydrogenase , was found only in the td library where it had large est support . the up-regulation was confirmed by rt-qpcr . the high abundance of this and other transcripts may reflect zahiri et al's <cit>  suggestion that genes required for, or immediately after, teliospore germination were transcribed prior to dormancy and stored for future translation. interestingly, among the genes for which there were differentially abundant transcripts according to r statistic analysis, half of the contigs representing genes of unknown function were composed of ests only from the td library. while this might reflect the lack of knowledge about teliospore biology and gene expression, it also supports the idea that taxon specific genes are expressed in taxon specific structures  <cit>  as teliospores are only produced by the smut and rust fungi.

the mc library has a relatively high est representation in the protein synthesis category including a large contribution by probable ribosomal proteins. the presence of large amounts of ribosomal protein transcripts was somewhat perplexing, as the carbon-stressed haploid cells appeared to have stopped dividing, this might imply the stop of protein synthesis. in addition, protease or ubiquitin ests were not detected in the mc library, indicating the cells were not degrading proteins to feed new synthesis. the ribosomal protein transcripts might have been transcribed prior to the stop of cellular activities and then stabilized on the switch to carbon starvation conditions. in this state, the cells would be primed for ribosome production when a carbon source becomes available. in s. cerevisiae, short duration glucose withdrawal experiments, showed that translation was halted while mrnas for ribosomal proteins remain intact  <cit> . in these, cells, translation recovered rapidly when glucose was re-introduced, and this recovery did not require new transcription  <cit> . in the u. maydis experiments, the period of carbon starvation was much longer and translation was not assessed; however, the existence of ribosomal protein transcripts suggests measuring translation before during and after carbon starvation may show that mrnas were stabilized and not translated, a situation similar to the teliospore.

morphological observations and growth curve determinations, suggested that u. maydis haploid cells grown in mn were rapidly adapting to the nitrogen stress environment. consistent with this is the observed expression of genes to obtain and metabolize all available nitrogen sources. the increased transcript level for these genes suggested by r statistic analyses was confirmed by rt-qpcr.

est representation and differential expression
the frequency of the est clones per contig across the different libraries was used to identify differentially abundant transcripts based on the r-statistical analysis of stekel et al.  <cit> . rt-qpcr analysis of eight genes indicated that est frequency in the mc library, constructed using the cap-trapper method, does not correspond to relative gene expression. the comparison here is between est frequencies in libraries constructed by two different methods, the other libraries were constructed using a smart cdna kit. the results confirm those of previous studies that showed cap-trapper and smart cdna library creation produce different distributions of ests  <cit> . they also support the contention that libraries constructed by different methods cannot be compared to provide information on the relative transcript abundance  <cit> . the statistical analysis does indicate, however, that the relative amounts of ests in the td, cm and mn libraries reflect differences in transcript abundance. furthermore, the rt-qpcr results provide insight into the u. maydis nutritional response.

metabolism of less favoured nitrogen sources
the seven u. maydis genes selected for rt-qpcr  were from three different nitrogen metabolism pathways, each controlled by ncr in other fungi  <cit> . previous investigation of u. maydis nitrate reductase nar <dig>  showed that it was induced in the absence of ammonia and the presence of nitrate  <cit> . however, the expression of nar <dig> in the absence of nitrate has not been assessed. rt-qpcr results showed that nar <dig> was up-regulated in mn  and in mm . while the level of nitrogen that may be leached from the cells transferred to the medium lacking a nitrogen source was not determined; it is clear that the cells under this low nitrogen condition were stressed. the low level of n is supported by the consistency of transcript level determinations with previous studies  <cit> . under these conditions expression patterns similar to that of nar1were found for the other nitrogen metabolism genes, suggesting that the control in u. maydis may be global. if this is the case then u. maydis, unlike most other fungi studied  <cit> , may have a single step mechanism for regulating expression of genes for metabolism of alternate nitrogen sources.

in an attempt to determine how a single step mechanism might be controlled in u. maydis, genes similar in sequence to known regulators of nitrogen metabolism were considered in relation to characterized regulatory systems. mips predicted a gene similar to the pathway specific activator nit <dig>  and blast searches carried out herein identified a nit2/area-like global regulator um <dig>  in a. nidulans the alternate nitrogen metabolism genes acetamidase, histidase and formamidase are under the sole control of global activator area and do not require additional inducers for activation  <cit> ; this could be the case in u. maydis. another control mechanism is present in magnaporthe grisea where genetic analysis indicates that two regulatory genes, npr <dig> and npr <dig>  act upstream of a area/nit2-like gata transcription factor to maintain ncr and induce pathogenesis  <cit> . like u. maydis, m. grisea alternate nitrogen metabolism genes were up regulated under nitrogen starvation without the presence of an alternate nitrogen source  <cit> . the similarities suggest that there may also be a global regulator or regulators in u. maydis.

the down regulation of nitrogen metabolism genes in mc , even though mc and mm both contain nitrate as a nitrogen source, suggests that carbon starvation overrides the nitrogen metabolism regulatory system. in contrast, carbon starvation in s. cerevisiae induces the expression of some nitrogen metabolism genes. the cross talk between the carbon and nitrogen signalling pathways in s. cerevisiae occurs through snf <dig>  a protein kinase involved in carbon regulation that also interacts with gln <dig>  the global repressor of nitrogen metabolism, during carbon starvation  <cit> . the data here suggest that there was crosstalk between the nitrogen and carbon signalling pathways in u. maydis and that the outcome of this was a reduced quantity of transcripts for genes involved in nitrogen up take and metabolism.

characteristics of u. maydis introns
in addition to utility in gene discovery and the study of differential expression, sequenced cdnas  allow for the elucidation of gene structure; specifically, alignment of ests to corresponding genomic loci identifies introns within the genome sequence and may define transcriptional start and stop sites. further, comparison of multiple cognate ests to one another may provide evidence of alternative pre-mrna splicing. the software tool geneseqer was used to align the est dataset to the u. maydis genome sequence, resulting in the identification of  <dig> predicted gene locations. of these,  <dig> were assigned more than one gene structure; an observation that was taken as preliminary evidence of alternative pre-mrna splicing of these loci. in total,  <dig>  introns were identified among the remaining  <dig>  pgls, a frequency of  <dig>  introns/pgl which is somewhat less than the  <dig>  introns/gene arrived at using manually-refined, software predicted, gene models  <cit> . the disagreement between this estimate and that of kämper et al.  <cit>  may result from the 5' limitation of ests analyzed here and the exclusion of pgls subject to alternative splicing prior to estimation.

the intron dataset was analyzed using an approach largely identical to that, employed by kupfer et al.  <cit> , of introns in the ascomycete yeasts s. cerevisiae and s. pombe; the filamentous ascomycetes a. nidulans and n. crassa; and the pathogenic basidomycete c. neoformans. the vast majority of u. maydis introns contain the canonical 5'-gu....ag-3' splice site dinucleotides and have splice site and branch point sequences that were in general agreement with the introns of these other fungi . however, there were two noteworthy features of u. maydis introns, rarity, as discussed by kämper et al.  <cit> , and length. at  <dig> nts, u. maydis introns were larger than those of c. neoformans , a. nidulans , n. crassa  and s. pombe . only s. cerevisiae  has a greater average intron length and, like u. maydis, s. cerevisiae is intron-poor while the other fungi were comparatively intron-rich. intron loss may be responsible for the predominance of larger introns in u. maydis and s. cerevisae. intron loss could result from constraints on the splicing process leading to the preferential loss of small introns, or be the outcome of a stochastic process acting on an intron population that is dominated by shorter introns.

alternative splicing
alternate splicing was predicted by in silico analysis and four genes were selected for rt-pcr amplifications aimed at confirming the existence of these predictions. the rt-pcr amplification of cdnas not represented in the libraries suggested that post-transcriptional processing is more complex than predicted. however, the presence of dna amplicons consistent in size with the est analysis predictions  suggested that alternately spliced transcripts are present in u. maydis.

there have been numerous reports of alternative pre-mrna splicing in fungi  <cit> . however, the majority of these refer to single genes, or gene families. in contrast, the identification here of  <dig> instances of alternate splicing among  <dig>  u. maydis pgls analyzed, along with the confirmation by rt-pcr, constitute one of only a small number of transcriptome-level investigations of this process in a fungus. as part of the c. neoformans genome sequence annotation, loftus et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> examples of alternative splicing among  <dig> , predicted gene models . ebbole et al.'s  <cit>  analysis of m. grisea ests led to the discovery of  <dig> instances of alternative splicing among  <dig>  unique expressed sequences . blast sequence comparisons between the u. maydis and c. neoformans genes identified  <dig> that are alternatively spliced in both species. despite differing analytical methodologies, the estimate here of  <dig>  % alternative splicing in u. maydis does not differ markedly from these other fungi. however, in all cases, the estimates were far less than that observed in "higher" eukaryotes , where as much as 74% of genes may be subject to alternative splicing  <cit> . the low level might suggest that, among fungi, alternative splicing is of marginal biological significance. however, this interpretation ignores the importance of est coverage when identifying alternatively spliced genes  <cit> . prior to the accumulation of large numbers of ests, estimates of the proportion of human genes subject to alternative splicing were as low as  <dig> %  <cit> . in contrast, present estimates were based on analyses that may incorporate millions of ests . if only the relevant subset of u. maydis genes were considered  the frequency of alternative splicing rises to >  <dig> %; while this is not a definitive estimate, it does support the notion that limited est coverage may lead to an underestimate of the frequency of this phenomenon in u. maydis, and fungi generally.

alternatively spliced transcripts may arise from the exclusion of an entire exon , the use of alternate 3' and/or 5' splice sites, or intron retention. with the exception of c. neoformans  <cit> , reports of alternative splicing in fungi have been largely restricted to examples of intron retention. in contrast, the dominant form of alternate splicing in mammals is exon skipping  with intron retention being observed infrequently   <cit> . the results presented here indicate that, in u. maydis intron retention is the major form of alternate splicing, accounting for  <dig> % of the observed events ; however, all forms of alternate splicing occur. therefore, as is the case for some fungi and mammals  <cit>  there are multiple forms of alternate splicing in u. maydis.

like u. maydis and c. neoformans, intron retention is the predominant form of alternate splicing in several plant species <cit> . wang and brendel  <cit>  suggest that this may be the result of differences in the mechanism of intron excision. specifically, mammals utilize  an exon definition mechanism whereby splice sites are paired across exons. under this model, the failure to recognize a 5' splice site results in "skipping" of the preceding exon  <cit> . in contrast, wang and brendel  <cit>  suggest that intron definition may be the more prevalent mechanism of splice site pairing in plants. in this case, failure to recognize the splice site leads to retention of the intron. given that fungi are thought to utilize an intron definition mechanism  <cit> , it may be that of intron retention in u. maydis, and fungi generally is the result of a failure to recognize splice sites.

human exons that were subject to alternative splicing tend to be bordered by splice sites that were degenerate relative to those of constitutively spliced exons  <cit> . in light of this observation, and given that intron retention was the principal form of alternative splicing in u. maydis, retained introns were compared to those that were constitutively spliced . of the  <dig> retained introns analyzed,  <dig> did not contain standard splice site dinucleotides ; the corresponding proportion among the constitutively spliced introns was  <dig>  %. further, among those retained introns bearing standard splice site dinucleotides, the sequences surrounding the splice sites and branch points were more degenerate than those of the constitutively spliced introns . ast  <cit>  proposes models for the evolution of alternative splicing in metazoans that predict degeneracy of the splice sites surrounding alternatively spliced exons. extension of these models to u. maydis may account for the degenerate splice sites associated with retained introns. in general these models were based in two possibilities, either intron retention is unregulated, resulting from splicing errors due to weak splice sites, or intron retention is controlled and there is a relaxation of splice site recognition that results in reduced sequence conservation. future experiments in u. maydis designed to distinguish between these possibilities will include determining the proportion of alternative splicing events that are regulated.

based primarily on the findings in humans and/or mice; organisms in which exon skipping is the principal form of alternative splicing, the canonical role of alternative splicing is to facilitate the synthesis of multiple, distinct, transcripts from a single gene. in turn, this allows for diversification of the proteome without a corresponding increase in the number of protein-coding genes  <cit> . in contrast, a large proportion of intron retention events result in frame shifts and this may lead to the incorporation of premature stop codons  <cit> . the high level of intron retention in u. maydis would not result in a substantial increase in proteome diversity. however, intron retention might serve as a mechanism for the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. if this were the case, it could occur either by the coupling of intron retention to mrna degradation  <cit>  or the regulation of intron removal, and the ensuing protein production. the latter could be linked to a developmental stage or cell type analogous to the mer <dig> gene of s. cerevisiae  <cit> .

antisense transcripts
comparing transcript and genome sequences allowed the identification of sense transcripts for  <dig>  genes and antisense transcripts for  <dig> genes. for um <dig>  a gene that had multiple ests supporting the existence of a sense and antisense transcripts, rt-pcr using strand-specific primers for first strand synthesis detected both transcripts in haploid cells grown in two nutritional conditions. the primers used in the pcr reaction amplified sense or antisense rna corresponding to the sense open reading frame. as such, no knowledge of the start or stop of either sense or antisense transcription was gained nor was there knowledge of the cell compartment from which each transcript was isolated. there was rt-pcr confirmation of an in silico prediction of sense and antisense transcription of a u. maydis gene. if this confirmation was extended to other in silico predictions of antisense transcription it would support the existence of multiple natural antisense transcripts  in u. maydis.

the role of the nats in u. maydis is not known. they could represent an increase in genome coding potential since  <dig> contained potential open reading frames . however, this phenomenon has not been widely noted in other organisms, this may indicate an evolutionary pressure to select against overlapping, co-transcribed genes. a possible explanation for such evolutionary bias is transcriptional interference, that is, the restricted elongation of overlapping transcripts by rna polymerase ii, as described in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . if this interference exists in u. maydis, separate non-overlapping orfs would be more sterically favoured for transcription, especially with a relatively low gene density. the average intergenic distance was  <dig> bp in u. maydis  <cit> . with this possible inhibition and the existence of antisense transcripts that do not have potential coding capacity, a role in regulation was considered more likely. however, coding and regulation are not exclusive since transcriptional interference itself might be a gene regulatory event where the increase transcription of one orf induces the suppression of its co-transcribed antisense counterpart.

there is evidence that antisense transcripts can regulate intron splicing in mammals  <cit>  and there is a bias toward intron containing genes among those with antisense transcripts in a. thaliana suggesting a link between antisense and introns  <cit> . there was no such bias in the presented u. maydis data although some of the antisense was to intron containing genes .

the u. maydis genes with antisense do not have high sense strand representation in the libraries; this could be the result of sense transcript degradation. the most studied nats are the 21– <dig> nt short interfering rnas  or the ~ <dig> nt micrornas  that have been found in plants, and animals  <cit> . the small rnas are created through the action of the rnaseiii, dicer, and both can mediate cleavage of complementary rna through a multi-protein risc-complex  <cit> . sirna can also mediate dna methylation leading to gene specific transcriptional silencing  <cit>  and mirnas can form ribonucleoprotein complexs  that bind to the 3' utr of the target transcripts inhibiting translation  <cit> . in the fungus n. crassa, two mechanisms, quelling and meiotic silencing by unpaired dna , induce gene silencing by rna degradation. both processes require the action of dicer and a risc-complex; proteins conserved among many of the fungi that exhibit rna gene suppression  <cit> . however, a recent comparative genomics study showed that, u. maydis lacks these rna mediated silencing components  <cit> ; indicating that u. maydis cannot form mirna or sirna by the traditional means and, if the antisense transcripts have a roll in controlling gene expression, it must be through some other mechanism.

in a previous test for a regulatory role of antisense rna expression, sense and antisense transcripts of pyr <dig>  a dihydroorotase, were expressed in u. maydis. the amount of enzyme activity was unaffected by overexpression of antisense transcripts  <cit> . however, antisense transcripts of pyr <dig> are not nats and it may be that the control in u. maydis is highly regulated or linked to specific genes or target sequences. c. albicans and s. cerevisiae also lack dicer and rna dependent rna polymerase, <cit>  rdrp  <cit> , yet c. albicans has the ability to suppress genes with anti-sense rna  <cit>  and rna complementary to the 5' utr was shown to trigger gene silencing in s. cerevisiae  <cit> .

while the role of antisense transcripts in u. maydis is currently unclear, the presence of rna mediated gene silencing in c. albicans and s. cerevisiae indicates the existence of uncharacterized mechanisms that do not require dicer like proteins and these could also be functioning in u. maydis. furthermore, two rna silencing pathways were recently identified in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , suggesting that other pathways remain to be discovered. the identified antisense transcripts in u. maydis provide a starting point for uncovering new roles for these molecules in cellular function.

CONCLUSIONS
the est analyses carried out here provide evidence that the control of nitrogen metabolism gene expression in u. maydis differs from the laboratory model fungi and may be similar to that of other plant pathogenic fungi. the predominance of intron retention in u. maydis, other fungi, and plants suggests that it may have a role in regulating gene expression. the observation of other modes of alternate splicing in u. maydis confirms the suggestion that this process is more diverse in fungi than previously recognized. the identification of antisense transcripts in u. maydis provides for the potential discovery of methods of regulating genes expression not described in eukaryotes. all of this data supports the continued development of est resources for reasons beyond facilitating gene identification.
