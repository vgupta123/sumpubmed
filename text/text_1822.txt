BACKGROUND
enterococci are commensal bacteria of intestinal tract of mammals and birds, but these bacteria can also be found in the gut of reptiles and insects, and in different environmental compartments like soil and plants, in food  as well as in aquatic ecosystems, both distributed with treated wastewater and lacking such anthropogenic impact  <cit> . in the human intestine, the enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are most abundant, and these two species are also most commonly isolated from human enterococcal infections, however, other species, such as enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum, and enterococcus raffinosus have also been detected  <cit> . recently e. faecalis and e. faecium play more and more important role in hospital-acquired infections , such as bacteremia, endocarditis, infections of urinary tract and post-surgery wounds  <cit> , and nowadays represent a second etiologic agent of hospital bloodstream infections in europe  <cit> . in the recent years, the relative proportion of e. faecium to e. faecalis is increasing in the us and europe  <cit> , which is likely due to the spread of a particular hospital-adapted polyclonal high-risk enterococcal complex  of e. faecium, initially described as clonal complex  <dig>  cc <dig>  <cit> . this nosocomial subpopulation consists of three main lineages, named from the central sequence type , defined by multilocus sequence typing , as lineages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the acquisition of resistance to antimicrobials of several classes constitutes an important feature of hospital-associated e. faecium, what not only renders them resilient to therapy but also creates a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes, often associated with mobile genetic elements , such as conjugative transposons and plasmids  <cit> . the most important from the clinical point of view examples of acquired resistance among enterococci include resistance to penicillins, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides  and high-level resistance to aminoglycosides   <cit> . resistance to ampicillin, associated with the changes in penicillin binding protein  <dig>  and resistance to quinolones, determined by point mutations in genes encoding bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase iv are characteristic phenotypic features of nosocomial e. faecium <cit> . such strains also commonly carry resistance genes to other classes of antimicrobials, such as tetracyclines {tet, tet, tet and tet}, macrolides {erm} and aminoglycosides  <cit> . the hlar phenotype is usually determined by the aac-ie-aph gene, encoding a so-called bi-functional enzyme responsible for resistance to all aminoglycosides, except for streptomycin; high-level resistance to this compound is typically specified by ant-ia <cit> . hospital-associated e. faecium is also enriched in several virulence factors, such as enterococcal surface protein  and mscramm proteins  <cit> .

several studies have addressed the spread of hireccs, especially vre, within as well as among health-care facilities  <cit> . much less is known, however, about the release of drug-resistant enterococci and hireccs into the environment, and their subsequent survival. since it is suspected that human-associated bacteria can be regarded as vectors of gene transmission into environmental populations  <cit>  and positive selection of bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents was observed in wastewater processes  <cit> , the potential role of effluents from wastewater treatment plant  in dissemination of clinically relevant bacteria and genes needs evaluation. it is particularly important in ecosystems subjected to strong anthropogenic impact, such as the gulf of gdansk and its shallow western part, the puck bay. significant pollution load is discharged to this coastal area through the numerous local rivers and marine outfalls. due to limited water exchange in the gulf of gdansk, safe wastewater disposal is essential to prevent the environmental degradation and to preserve the public health. epidemiological studies reported a direct relationship between the risk of gastroenteritis among swimmers and density of enterococci in surface waters  <cit> . additionally, resistant and multiresistant enterococci were detected in effluent of wwtps  <cit> , suggesting their survival capacity in treatment processes. however, no microbiological standards have been set on wwtp effluents in the majority of european countries and it is required instead to monitor the quality of recreational water  <cit> . the us environmental protection agency  <cit>  as well as the european union legislation  <cit>  recommended detection of fecal enterococci, together with escherichia coli as indicators of fecal contamination of bathing water.

aim of the current study was to investigate the presence and species composition of enterococci in treated wastewater, river estuary water and their recipient, highly anthropogenically impacted gulf of gdansk. for this purpose, enterococci were isolated from wastewater of two local wwtps, gdansk-wschod  and gdynia-debogorze  as well as from their marine outfalls . additionally, the vistula river mouth was sampled, due to ecological importance of this river flows for the gulf of gdansk area . identification and further characterization of drug-resistant enterococci, especially the most prevalent e. faecium, including its resistance, virulence and mge genes was in the special focus of the study, due to the problem posed by such clones for safe, economical and reliable way of wastewater disposal in costal ecosystems.

RESULTS
species composition and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcal isolates
in this study, the number of enterococci in wwtp effluents  remained high for both wwtp, yielding up to  <dig> x <dig> cfu per 100 ml , although the wwtp gdansk-wschod showed over 99% efficiency in the removal of enterococci. in marine outfalls of the two wwtps  as well as at the vistula river mouth, enterococci were detected at low densities, i.e. below 100 cfu per 100 ml. altogether,  <dig> isolates were collected, including  <dig> isolates from wastewater,  <dig> isolates from marine outfalls, and  <dig> from vistula river mouth . these  <dig> isolates were mainly identified as e. faecium , enterococcus hirae  and e. faecalis , with an occasional occurrence of e. gallinarum/casseliflavus, e. durans and e. avium . the most common species in all sampled sites was e. faecium , with the exception of vistula river mouth where e. hirae was predominant , followed by e. faecalis .

in the next step, antimicrobial susceptibility was tested for e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates . it should be noted that at some points a low number of e. faecalis isolates was recovered  and thus, certain resistance rates obtained for e. feacalis should be treated with caution. resistance to erythromycin was detected with the highest prevalence among both species, however, rates of resistance to this compound varied over a broad range. erythromycin-resistant e. faecium comprised  <dig> % of isolates in raw wastewater ,  <dig> % in treated wastewater  and  <dig> % in marine outflow  of wwtp gdansk-wschod. similar tendency was seen for e. faecalis isolates where resistance rates in the sampling points listed above were equal to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 100%, respectively. for wwtp gdynia-debogorze effluent  and marine outflow , erythromycin resistance rates for e. faecium varied between  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, while for e. faecalis were equal  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in the case of fluoroquinolones, resistance to ciprofloxacin among e. faecium varied between  <dig> % in vistula river mouth to  <dig> % in w-mout, while resistance to levofloxacin did not exceed 20%. among e. faecalis resistance to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was, in general lower then reported for e. faecium in the corresponding sampling points , except vistula river mouth. the high-level streptomycin resistance  was prevalent and reached  <dig> % for e. faecium isolates from marine outflow of wwtp gdansk-wschod . also for e. faecalis, hlsr phenotype was detected among up to 16% of all tested isolates. resistance to glycopeptides, linezolid and daptomycin was not detected among all tested enterococci.

clonal structure of e. faecium isolates, and distribution of virulence, resistance and mge genes
sixty-nine isolates of e. faecium  were further subjected to mlst and analysis of the presence of resistance, virulence and mge genes. these isolates presented various phenotypes of resistance to antimicrobial compounds, as described below, and were obtained mostly from effluents and marine outfalls of both wwtps . mlst discerned  <dig> different sts , including  <dig> new ones . the comparative eburst analysis against the whole mlst e. faecium database  grouped the  <dig> sts, specific for  <dig> isolates into the major ‘super-complex 17’, characteristic for this species . further detailed analysis of the localization of particular sts within this structure revealed that  <dig> sts characteristic for  <dig> isolates belonged to the nosocomial complex of e. faecium, representing all three major lineages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of a former cc <dig>  as defined by willems et al. <cit>  . seventeen sts , nine sts  and two sts with single isolates each belonged to cc <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig>  respectively, as defined by freitas et al. <cit> . of the remaining  <dig> sts, nine were included into six small ccs , unlinked to the major ‘super-complex’; st <dig> formed a ‘doubleton’  and six sts, represented by single isolates, were singletons, i.e. were not related to any st in the database at the time of analysis. thirty isolates  in the investigated group showed the mdr phenotype, which was significantly associated  with isolates from the nosocomial complex  but found also in cc <dig>  cc <dig> and cc94; this phenotype did not occur among small ccs or singletons. seventeen isolates, representing the nosocomial complex were additionally studied by multilocus vntr  analysis  to better elucidate the relationships among these isolates. altogether, nine mlva-types  were found . importantly, the same mlva-type, mt <dig> associated with st <dig> was characteristic for isolates derived from samples from w-eff and w-mout, suggesting survival of this particular clone.

discussion
in this study, enterococcus spp. was used to evaluate the impact posed by treated wastewater of two local wwtps on their receiver, the costal waters of gulf of gdansk. total counts of enterococci observed for raw  and treated  wastewater are consistent with our previous study, showing similar, over 99% reduction capacity of applied treatment processes. it is also reported in the literature that wastewater treatment processes based on activated sludge, although they focus on removal of nutrients and organic matter, simultaneously reduce faecal indicators with high efficiency, reaching up to  <dig> %  <cit> . due to the high number of enterococci in raw wastewater, they are nevertheless released from a wwtp in a number up to  <dig> x <dig> cfu per 100 ml. thus, marine water sampled in the area directly impacted by treated wastewater  showed a higher number of enterococci than the one observed in vistula river mouth, however, lower by four orders of magnitude in comparison to corresponding treated wastewater . it should be noted that in marine outfalls  as well as in vistula river mouth enterococci were detected in number lower than 100 cfu per 100 ml, i.e. the value set out by new bathing water directive 2006/7/ec for the costal water of “excellent quality”  <cit> .

it is suggested that enterococcal species composition in faecal-impacted environment depends from the source of contamination. in this study, two species most commonly colonizing humans, e. faecalis and e. faecium comprised together from 73% to 88% of enterococcal isolates in tested wastewater samples , 73% and 61% in marine outflows  and 45% in the vistula river mouth. the predominant species in wastewater and marine water impacted by treated wastewater was e. faecium , which stayed at a similar level during treatment processes, as determined also in our previous study  <cit> . species distribution in wastewater samples is not well understood, and affecting factors may include differences in diet, climate, season and methods of detection. e. feacalis was found to be the most prevalent species in wastewater samples in sweden  <cit> , e. faecium in spain, uk, canada, france and switzerland  <cit> , while e. hirae predominated in portugal and united states  <cit> . although e. faecalis is typically the most abundant colonizer of humans in the community , e. faecium is generally most often associated with human microbial contamination  <cit> . e. faecalis was reported from agriculture-impacted waters  <cit>  and e. hirae likely originates mainly from cattle and pig faecal contamination  <cit> , which explains high relative proportion of these two species in vistula river mouth. apart from the variability of contamination sources, proportion of particular species may differ due to the differences of ability to sustain environmental stresses. in this study, enterococcal composition might have been influenced by wastewater treatment processes and marine water characteristics.

the effect of wastewater treatment and marine environment was seen on phenotypes of antimicrobial resistance. the positive selection of bacteria with resistance patterns has been already suggested and noted in wastewater processes  <cit> . in this study, the resistance rates to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and erythromycin, noted for e. faecium from raw wastewater  were lower than these observed for this species in the corresponding treated wastewater , however, not statistically significant . moreover, resistance rates to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and erythromycin observed in marine outflow of wwtp gdansk-wschod  were higher than in treated wastewater of this plant. such phenomenon was not observed for treated wastewater of wwtp gdynia-debogorze  and its marine outfall . resistance rates among e. faecium originating from d-mout were, in general, comparable to these detected in the vistula river mouth. it should be noted that treated wastewater from wwtp gdansk-wschod has been discharged via marine outfall  for last 12 years while marine outfall of wwtp gdynia-debogorze  has been operating for last two years. the observed differences in resistance rate corresponding to the local impact caused by long and short-term operated marine outfalls  need further attention.

significant rates of antimicrobial resistance, observed for isolates of e. faecalis from wastewater and marine/river waters, impacted by wastewater, are in agreement with a recent study performed in six european countries, showing that in poland the rates of resistance for human isolates of this species were usually among the highest, both in the community and hospitals  <cit> . to our knowledge, no corresponding data are available for e. faecium colonization in the community in poland but a study focused on hospital vre isolates showed their ubiquitous mdr phenotype and a high load of resistance genes  <cit> . in our study no vancomycin resistance were detected, likely due to relatively low  prevalence of vre in polish hospitals  <cit> , although such isolates are isolated from the environment in other countries e.g.,  <cit> .

this study shows that hospital clones of e. faecium are important carriers of resistance genes in wastewaters. most likely, in a significant part they originated from hospital wastewater treated together with communal wastewater. in our estimation, hospital wastewater constitutes approximately  <dig> % of both wwtps’ daily inflow. the release of hospital-associated clones of e. faecium to the environment was observed also by others  <cit> . in our study, isolates belonging to the major nosocomial hirecc  constituted altogether  <dig> % of all isolates of e. faecium subjected to typing, and were present at all sampling sites. these isolates, apart from their inclusion into the hirecc by mlst, demonstrated several other phenotypic and genotypic features typical for nosocomial e. faecium, i.e. they were resistant to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin, in vast majority showed mdr phenotype, and carried several resistance determinants, associated both with mutations of chromosomal genes  and, in the case of aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance, with gene acquisition. plasmids likely played an important role in the later process, as some plasmid genes, such as rep2pre <dig>  rep17prum and rep18pef <dig>  and tas genes axe-txe and ω-ε-ζ were significantly more abundant in isolates associated with hirecc than among the remaining isolates. as yet, the knowledge of distribution of plasmid-associated genes in populations of e. faecium, especially in the context of their clonal composition, remains limited. a study on  <dig> isolates of different geographical origins and from various sites showed an over-representation of rep17prum and reppmg <dig> among nosocomial e. faecium, while, in contrast to our observations, rep18pef <dig> was not detected  <cit> . moreover, we did not observe reppmg <dig> among hirecc of e. faecium. these differences may be due to a high prevalence of vre  among  <dig> isolates studied by rosvoll et al. what may explain differences in the plasmid content. the same study also reported the co-localization of ω-ε-ζ with rep2pre <dig> and axe-txe with rep17prum on the same plasmids, in concordance with our findings, showing a frequent joint occurrence of these pairs of genes. another study, performed on  <dig> invasive isolates from norway, mostly of hlgr phenotype, showed a significantly higher prevalence of rep2pre <dig> and rep17prum among the major nosocomial hirecc  <cit> . this study as well some others  <cit>  also demonstrated a common presence of repplg <dig> among e. faecium from hospital settings and in animals. our findings indicate that this type of replicon is even more ubiquitous in e. faecium than previously reported. all rep genes mentioned above are typically associated with plasmids carrying various antimicrobial resistance genes  <cit> , genbank accession number af <dig>  in addition to genes determining antimicrobial resistance and genes associated with mge, isolates of nosocomial hirecc analyzed in our study carried such molecular markers as is <dig> and the esp gene together with the inta gene characteristic for iceefm <cit> . another pathogenicity factor, the fms <dig> gene of the pilin gene cluster  <dig>  showed increased prevalence among these isolates. similar observation was made for a representative collection of  <dig> e. faecium isolates from various sources  <cit> .

in a study that followed enterococci in a continuum from hospital and retirement home wastewaters through a wwtp to a river, a gradual decrease in the proportion of e. faecium isolates representing hospital-associated sts was observed, likely due to the “dilution” of hirecc representatives by more diverse and less drug-resistant strains originating from the community  <cit> . because in our study only selected representatives of obtained isolates were investigated, it is not possible to determine precise tendencies in their frequency from the wwtp influent to effluent and water, however, resistant enterococci, both hirecc and non-hirecc, are clearly able to survive the treatment process, what results in their release into marine and river waters. moreover, using an additional typing method, mlva, we were able to find isolates with the same characteristics in the effluent of wwtp and its marine outfall, suggesting ability of such clones to survive in the environment for at least some time. it seems plausible that hospital resistant clones accumulate several determinants that may promote their survival not only in the hospital settings but also in the environment. such features would include resistance to disinfectants and ultraviolet light, additional metabolic pathways and ability to form biofilms. moreover, determinants of some of the mentioned adaptation factors are found co-resident in plasmids harboring resistance genes, suggesting co-selection. for example, plg1-type plasmids of e. faecium carry not only resistance determinants against aminoglycosides, glycopeptides and macrolides but also pili genes and carbon uptake-utilization genes  <cit> . pheromone-responsive plasmids of e. faecalis apart from resistance to aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, penicillins and macrolides may encode bacteriocins, additional pili and uv-resistance determinants  <cit> . thus, nosocomial hireccs, released by wwtps, are equipped in whole sets of genes with various adaptive benefits and often located within mge. it was also demonstrated that mges can be transferred in a wwtp  <cit> , further underling the importance of threat posed by such organisms. there is a selection pressure for survival of resistant strains and their tranconjugants due to release of antibiotics to the environment, especially in the hospital effluents  <cit> , and even sub-inhibitory concentrations may be effective in selection for resistance  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the species composition, resistance profiles and clonal relationships of enterococci isolated from wwtps located in gdansk, their marine outfalls to the gulf of gdansk and from vistula river. it was observed that these wwtps release enterococcal strains resistant to various antimicrobial compounds to the recipient water environment. molecular analyses revealed the presence of clones associated with nosocomial hireccs, and, in the case of e. faecium isolates of lineages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of former cc <dig> abundant in resistance determinants, mge genes and pathogenicity factors. the presence of hireccs in wastewaters and marine/river environment highlights the need for further detailed analyses to better understand the survival and spread of drug-resistant strains in water ecosystems, and to elucidate the ways to curb such dissemination.
