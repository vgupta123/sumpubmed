BACKGROUND
over the last two decades, there has been considerable interest in improving nitrogen use efficiency  in model and crop plants using quantitative genetic approaches  <cit> , mainly because attempts to engineer plant n metabolism have on most occasions, only met with limited success  <cit> . the aim of such studies based on the construction of genetic maps and then qtl detection, has been to identify chromosomal regions involved in the control of yield and its components and to determine the relative importance of high or low nitrogen  fertilisation  <cit> . thus, exploiting the genetic variability of grain yield and grain quality traits under n-limiting or non-limiting conditions appeared to be a key target for improving nue. more recently, a number of quantitative genetic studies performed mostly on rice and maize, were conducted to detect qtls for the nutritional quality of grain or stover  as a function of n fertilisation .

in other quantitative studies aimed at identifying the genetic basis of nue, in addition to agronomic traits, the association of metabolic and physiological functions with dna markers was also investigated .

as for the agronomic traits, a significant genotypic variation was observed for various physiological traits measured in young developing leaves related to n metabolism. in particular, coincidences of qtls for yield and its components with genes encoding cytosolic glutamine synthetase  and the corresponding enzyme activity were detected, which could partially explain the variations in yield. since a qtl for a thousand kernel weight was coincident with a cytosolic gs  locus, and qtls for a thousand kernel weight and yield were coincident with another cytosolic gs  locus  <cit> , further work was undertaken to validate the function of these two putative candidate genes. in subsequent studies, it was also shown that the corresponding gs <dig>  isoenzyme is present in the leaf mesophyll cells, whereas the gs1- <dig> isoenzyme is specifically localized in the leaf bundle sheath cells. in addition, it was found that in maize leaves among the five different cytosolic isoenzymes, gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  are the most highly expressed irrespective of the plant developmental stage  <cit> . thus, the impact of the knockout mutations gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  on kernel yield and its components were examined in plants grown under non-limiting n feeding conditions  <cit> . the phenotypes of the two mutant lines were characterized by a reduction of kernel size in the gln <dig>  mutant and by a reduction of kernel number in the gln <dig>  mutant. transgenic plants that overexpressed gln <dig>  constitutively in the leaves, exhibited an increase in kernel number, thus providing further evidence that the gs <dig>  isoenzyme plays a major role in controlling kernel yield under high  <cit>  or low n fertilisation conditions  <cit> . the hypothesis that gs is one of the key steps in the control of cereal productivity was strengthened by a study performed on rice, in which a co-localization of a qtl for the gs <dig>  locus and a qtl for one-spikelet weight was identified  <cit> . as a confirmation, a strong reduction in growth rate and kernel yield was observed in rice mutants deficient in gs <dig>   <cit> .

in order to improve our knowledge of the physiological and molecular responses of two maize mutants deficient in the expression of gln <dig>  and gln <dig> , an analysis of the leaf metabolome was conducted in parallel with a proteomic and a transcriptomic study at the vegetative stage and in the middle of the grain filling period, representing key physiological and developmental stages during the life cycle of the plant. these studies provide an integrated view of the biological responses of the mutant plants, spanning from gene expression and protein content to metabolite accumulation. the possibility that these traits can be used as investigative tools to identify candidate genes for grain production, in relation to plant growth and development, is discussed.

RESULTS
changes in leaf metabolite profile of gln <dig> and gln <dig> mutants
in the present study, gc/ms analysis of the leaf metabolome was performed using wt, gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutant plants grown on a high n supply. samples were taken at two key stages of plant development: the leaf vegetative stage  and 55 days after silking, referred to as leaf maturity , as described in methods. at the v stage, during which young developing maize leaves efficiently assimilate co <dig> through the c <dig> photosynthetic pathway and inorganic n for amino acid and protein synthesis  <cit> , extensive differences were observed in metabolite accumulation between the two gs mutants in comparison to the wt .

at the v stage in the leaves of the gln <dig>  mutant, among the  <dig> identified metabolites that showed statistically significant differences compared to the wt in the three replicates , the concentrations of most of the soluble amino acids , as well as a number of soluble sugars and sugar alcohols, were strongly reduced by  <dig> to  <dig> fold. the amount of the polyamine putrescine was also lower in comparison to the wt.

in the leaves of the gln <dig>  mutant,  <dig> metabolites were present in lower concentrations, as compared to the wt. these metabolites included various c containing molecules and some precursors of lignin biosynthesis such as coumaroylquinate, quinate, and shikimate, the content of the latter two being also lower in the gln <dig>  mutant. in addition, as determined in the gln <dig>  mutant, lower amounts of the polyamine putrescine were detected in gln <dig> , whilst leucine was the only amino acid that exhibited a decrease. lower amounts of carbohydrates such as galactose, sedoheptulose and sugar alcohols such as erythritol, were also detected in both gln <dig>  and gln <dig> . all together, these results show that at the v stage and irrespective of the gs mutation, there is a decrease in the accumulation of a set of metabolites .

in the leaves of the gln <dig>  mutant, a significant increase was observed in the content of a number of organic acids involved in the tricarboxylic acid  cycle, notably malate, 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate and aconitate. such an increase was only observed in the gln <dig>  mutant, for malate alone. one possible explanation for this finding could be that in gln <dig> , there is an accumulation of molecules that are normally used as carbon skeletons for the synthesis of amino acids. in particular these would be the amino acids derived from glutamine and glutamate that are presumably synthesized at a much lower rate when the activity of the gs <dig>  isoenzyme is reduced. interestingly, the sinapinate content of gln <dig>  was around  <dig> times higher compared to the wt, suggesting that part of the lignin biosynthesis pathway had been severely altered, since phenylpropanoid metabolism is extremely dependent on the n status of the plant  <cit> . an increase in the concentrations of raffinose, rhamnose, galactinol, mannitol and maltose has previously been observed in n-deficient maize plants  <cit> . the increase in inositol, a molecule related to stress conditions and involved in the control of plant growth  <cit> , is an interesting finding, which suggests that the metabolic response caused by the lack of the gs <dig>  isoenzyme is similar to that found for other abiotic stresses  <cit> . the increase in such a range of metabolites probably occurs partly at the expense of the precursor glucose, since the increases were less in the gln <dig>  mutant, a situation similar to that also found under n limiting conditions  <cit> . the increase in the vitamin nicotinate, a stress protective molecule  <cit>  and malonate, a defence compound  <cit> , further supports the hypothesis that the partial lack of gs activity mimics stress conditions. moreover, such stress conditions are likely to lower the demand for the respiration of alternative substrates such as 2-hydroxyglutarate  <cit> , a molecule that accumulates almost five fold in the gln <dig>  mutant.

in the gln <dig>  mutant, the number of metabolites exhibiting an increase in their amount was much lower compared to gln <dig> . phenylalanine was one of the most interesting, as its accumulation probably occurred to avoid feedback inhibition of the corresponding biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . such an accumulation of phenyalanine could explain why there is a decrease in the accumulation of its precursor shikimate, or its derivates coumaroylquinate and quinate, both molecules being precursors of lignin biosynthesis  <cit> .

from the metabolite profile at the v stage, it would appear that the impact of the gln <dig>  mutation was much greater than that of the gln <dig>  mutation. such a finding is logical, since it has been shown that the gene encoding the gs <dig>  isoenzyme is constitutively expressed irrespective of the leaf developmental stage, whilst the expression of the gene encoding the gs <dig>  isoenzyme is much lower and only enhanced at later stages of leaf development  <cit> . moreover, it is well known that a lack of n assimilates such as amino acids before the flowering period, as observed in the metabolic profile of the gln <dig>  mutant, can cause ovule abortion  <cit> . consequently, there is a reduction in the grain number of the gln <dig>  mutant  <cit> . at the m stage, the metabolite profiles of leaves below the ear in the two gs mutants were very different compared to the leaves of plants at the v stage. the only exceptions were metabolites such as aconitate, rhamnose and malate, which exhibited an opposite pattern of accumulation, depending on the plant developmental stage, or the gs mutation . less than half of the metabolites  exhibited differences in their concentration in the gln <dig>  mutant between the m and the v stage. in contrast, in the gln <dig>  mutant, the number of metabolites exhibiting an altered level of accumulation was similar between the two stages of plant development . however, in the gln <dig>  mutant, the number of metabolites exhibiting an increase in concentration was three times higher at the m stage, compared to that found at the v stage . as discussed above for the v stage, this could be related to the fact that the gs <dig>  isoenzyme is preferentially involved in the grain filling process at the later m stage of plant development  <cit> .

at the m stage, there was still a reduction in the amount of organic acids of the tca cycle, but this was limited to aconitate in the gln <dig>  mutant. in the gln <dig>  mutant, the amount of malate and other organic acids derived from the tca cycle such as citramalate and glucarate were reduced. at the grain filling stage in the gln <dig>  mutant, decreases in the amounts of several other soluble carbohydrates such as melibiose, arabinose and glycerolipids such as galactosylglycerol were observed. a considerable decrease in the amount of galactarate was detected in the gln <dig>  mutant. this decrease was much less in the gln <dig>  mutant. the biosynthesis and physiological roles of a number of the metabolites listed above have not been clearly defined and further work is required to identify their role in plants in relation to stress in general  <cit> , and n-deficiency stress in particular. the 3-fold increase in the amount of phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose and glucose in the gln <dig>  mutant only, indicates that during the grain filling period, a large proportion of the c molecules fuelling the tca cycle were not used or were exported. this presumably results from an alteration in the sink capacity of the plant characterised by the considerable reduction in grain number  <cit> .

in the gln <dig>  mutant, an increase in the concentration of coumarate and caffeate, two precursors of lignin that were not detected at the v stage, suggests that an alteration in cell wall synthesis or composition, also occurred at the m stage. interestingly, in the gln <dig>  mutant, the decrease in the amino acids observed at the v stage was not detected at the m stage. in contrast, the gln <dig>  mutant, in which the amino acid content was not modified at the v stage, exhibited a  <dig> to  <dig> fold increase in valine, serine, threonine, methionine, aspartate, alanine and glutamate at the m stage. since we showed previously that the synthesis of a number of these amino acids still occurred at the m stage in wt plants  <cit> , it is likely that their accumulation  is due to the lack of gs <dig>  activity during the grain filling period. as these amino acids are not exported to the grain until this m stage of plant development, there is a reduction in grain size in the gln <dig>  mutant  <cit> , as n translocation is required to fill the grain  <cit> . however, it cannot be completely ruled out that the amino acids could be exported to the grain at a later stage of development.

changes in the leaf proteome of the gln <dig> and gln <dig> mutants
at the v stage, when the leaf proteome of the wt was compared with the gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutants,  <dig> protein spots were identified as exhibiting significant differences in their volume  in the former and  <dig> proteins in the latter. the densitometric quantification of these differences is presented in additional file 1: tables s <dig> and s <dig>  at the m stage, the volumes of  <dig> protein spots were significantly modified in the gln <dig>  mutant, whereas only  <dig> proteins were modified in the gln <dig>  mutant .

at the v stage, among the  <dig> identified proteins in the gln <dig>  mutant,  <dig> were present at lower and  <dig> at higher concentrations. these proteins are involved in a variety of physiological processes including c assimilation, photosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, proteolysis, stress/defence mechanisms and translation. in the gln <dig>  mutant the same biological processes were altered, however compared to the gln <dig>  mutant, there were much fewer proteins present in lower  or higher amounts . therefore, it can be concluded that at the protein accumulation level, the impact of the gln <dig>  mutation was much stronger than that of gln <dig> .

one of the most interesting results from the proteomic study performed at the v stage, was the stronger impact of the gln <dig>  mutation compared to the gln <dig>  mutation on the accumulation of proteins involved in c assimilation and c metabolism, whereas those involved in n metabolism displayed no changes in their level of accumulation. it was also observed that among the  <dig> proteins present in lower amounts in the gln <dig>  mutant,  <dig> of the same proteins were also found to be present in lower amounts in the gln <dig>  mutant . such findings suggest that at the proteomic level the two gs mutations had a similar impact on a number of biological processes. in particular, the decrease in amount of the enzymes ribose-5-phosphate isomerase  <cit>  and nadp-dependent malate dehydogenase  <cit>  suggests that the pentose phosphate pathway and the c <dig> photosynthetic pathway respectively, were down-regulated in response to the lower flux of reduced n going through the reaction catalysed by gs <dig>  or gs <dig> . in addition, the finding that peroxiredoxin and glutaredoxin  were less abundant in the two gs mutants indicates that redox signals  <cit>  and oxidative stress responses  <cit> , in relation to photosynthesis, were also altered. in line with the finding that c metabolism and some of its associated processes were modified in the two gs mutants, an accumulation of the translation initiation factor if <dig>  a protein that is an important component of the regulation of photosynthetic gene expression  <cit> , was also detected.table  <dig>

at the m stage, the differences in protein profiles of the two gs mutants were not the same as those detected at the v stage. although in gln <dig> , three proteins were found to be present either in higher or lower amounts at both stages of plant development . in the gln <dig>  mutant and to a lesser extent in the gln <dig>  mutant, the changes observed in the protein profiles at the m stage indicate that the main metabolic functions involved were related to photosynthesis and to c metabolism. proteins involved in the efficiency of the photosystems and the glycolytic, pentose phosphate and starch biosynthesis pathways were present in much lower quantities. interestingly a significant number of these proteins such as phosphoribulokinase, and nadp-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase , exhibited a common pattern of accumulation in the two gs mutants. such findings, in line with the accumulation of metabolites, suggest that, during the grain-filling period, the lower flux of n going through the reaction catalysed by gs triggers a reduction in c assimilation, likely because the sink capacity of the plant in terms of c translocation to the developing ear is strongly reduced. surprisingly, lower amounts of the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were detected in the gln <dig>  mutant, whereas in gln <dig>  there was an accumulation of the protein. such contradictory patterns of accumulation could be related to the stress-responsive nature of the enzyme  <cit> , which appears to be specific for each gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutation.

in addition, among the proteins exhibiting a decrease in their amount in the two gs mutants, there were two isoforms of the enzyme arginine decarboxylase. this result suggests that polyamine biosynthesis was modified in gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  presumably in response to the stress caused by the reduction in leaf gs activity. the involvement of polyamines during abiotic stress  <cit>  is in line with the finding that the putrescine and spermidine contents were decreased or increased respectively in the gs mutants . the presence of higher or lower amounts of a number of oxidative stress-responsive proteins, such as peroxidases, superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxins as well as various biotic and abiotic stress-responsive proteins, was evident either in both, or only one of the two gs mutants .

at the m and v stages, the common set of proteins that were down-regulated and up-regulated in gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  were different . this result suggests that in the two gs mutants there is a core set of proteins corresponding to different biological processes that are specifically altered at each of the two developmental stages examined. as in a number of proteomic studies related to plant stress , relatively few proteins exhibited significant differences in their level of accumulation in the two gs mutants. reduced gs activity altered the accumulation of proteins and enzymes involved in photosynthesis, primary c metabolism and stress-related regulatory mechanisms, a plant response similar to that observed under n deficient conditions .

correlations between the two gln1mutations, mrna accumulation and a variety of metabolic, signalling and developmental processes
at the v stage,  <dig> and  <dig> mrna transcripts were present in lower amounts in the leaves of the gln <dig>  and the gln <dig>  mutants respectively, when compared to the wt. . the biological processes most significantly reduced in the two gln <dig> mutants, were c metabolism, stress/defence, proteolysis, signalling, transport, as well as components of the translation and transcription machinery. in the gln <dig>  mutant, the reduction in transcript accumulation for adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, nad-malate dehydrogenase, ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase and pyruvate dehydrogenase suggests that, at least at the transcriptional level, important steps of primary c assimilation were down-regulated . the high level of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase mrna accumulation further supports this hypothesis, as phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex would reduce enzyme activity and consequently the c flux through the tca cycle  <cit> . another important impact of the gln <dig>  mutation was a decrease in the amount of transcripts encoding proteins involved in sugar and amino acid transport, which suggests that the translocation and thus the subsequent accumulation of a number of c and n metabolites may be reduced.

the decrease both in terms of the number of biological processes involved and the portfolio of genes belonging to each of these processes was much higher in the gln <dig>  mutant compared to the gln <dig>  mutant. such findings, in agreement with the metabolomic and proteomic studies, could explain why the impact of the gln <dig>  mutation, compared to the gln <dig>  mutation, was much higher in terms of grain yield penalty  <cit> .

at the v stage, transcripts of  <dig> genes were present in higher amounts in the gln <dig>  mutant as compared to the wt , whereas in the gln <dig>  mutant there were only  <dig> . transcripts of various genes encoding proteins having different metabolic and signalling roles, in stress/defence, translation, transcription and transport were predominantly represented. whilst those genes encoding enzymes involved in c and secondary metabolite metabolism and precursors of cell wall synthesis were present to a lesser extent. transcripts of asparaginase, which exhibited a strong homology with asparaginase  <dig> from grasses, were more than three-fold higher in gln <dig>  than in the wt, otherwise there were no major changes in gene expression of the proteins involved in n assimilation. again, the impact of the gs mutation with respect to the enhanced expression of a number of genes involved in the various functions listed in additional file 1: tables s5b and s7b, was much higher in the gln <dig>  mutant.

a similar pattern of transcript accumulation was observed at the m stage, both in the gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutant. the number of up- and down-regulated genes in the gln <dig>  mutant was  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, which is quantitatively similar to that detected at the v stage. in gln <dig> , there was an increase in the expression of  <dig> genes and a decrease in the expression of  <dig> genes, indicating that the number of genes with a modified level of expression was approximately two-fold higher compared to the v stage . as identified at the v stage, the main biological processes that were altered in the gln <dig>  mutant were metabolism, signalling, stress/defence and transport. however, at the m stage in comparison to the v stage, the number of up- or down-regulated genes encoding enzymes involved in c metabolism was much lower. interestingly, the number of genes encoding proteins relating to proteolytic activity were significantly increased in the gln <dig>  mutant at the m stage compared to the v stage . the hypothesis that the gs <dig>  isoenzyme is involved in the recycling of ammonia released during protein degradation  <cit> , may explain the changes observed in the expression of genes encoding various proteases. in line with this observation, it has also been found that protein degradation was enhanced in transgenic plants overexpressing cytosolic gs  <cit> . as identified at the v stage, the impact of the two gs mutations on genes encoding enzymes and proteins involved in n assimilation and recycling remained very limited. such observations lead to the conclusion that in maize, cytoplasmic gs is a central hub at the cross roads of a number of plant metabolic and regulatory functions, other than n assimilation per se.

in recent “omics”-based studies performed on maize and other species  <cit> , it has been shown that the plant developmental stage must be taken into account, as there are large differences both at the physiological and molecular levels during the transition from n assimilation to n remobilisation  <cit> . when maize plants were grown under n-limiting conditions, no decreases or increases in the amounts of transcripts were found that were common to the v and m stage  <cit> . in contrast, in the two gs mutants, a number of transcripts  exhibited a similar pattern of accumulation at both stages of plant development . a qrt-pcr experiment performed on four selected genes exhibiting an increase or a decrease in the gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutants in comparison to the wt at the v and the m stage of plant development, confirmed that the level of leaf transcript accumulation was similar to that observed in the 46 k microarray experiment .

a list of selected genes that exhibited a fold change higher than  <dig> in a mutant compared to the wt is shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  they could be key candidate genes representative of the reprogramming machinery involved in the control of shoot growth and development in the two mutants, in which only grain yield, but not leaf size or leaf number, was affected  <cit> . our study also shows that for a number of key metabolic pathways such as the primary assimilation of c and n, major changes could occur in terms of metabolite accumulation as shown in the present study , but not at the gene expression level. as previously shown in several investigations, very little direct correspondence between the accumulation of metabolites, proteins and mrna transcripts has been found in “omics”-based studies  <cit> . such a situation is probably due to the complex nature of biological networks and to the fact that both tissue and cellular compartmentation and translocation between different organs, are generally not taken into account .table  <dig>

common changes in key biological functions are found in the gln <dig> and gln <dig> mutants that are dependent on the plant developmental stage
a limited number of transcripts exhibited a similar pattern of accumulation in both the gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutants, suggesting that the decrease in leaf gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  activity induces a common plant response at the transcriptional level. at the v stage, in both mutants,  <dig> genes were up-regulated,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> genes showed an opposite pattern of expression. . at the m stage,  <dig> genes were up-regulated,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> genes showed an opposite pattern of expression . interestingly in both mutants, transcripts for a 40s and 60s ribosomal protein showed an opposite pattern of accumulation at the v stage and the m stage respectively.

in a similar manner to the proteomic changes, the responses in transcript accumulation could provide clues as to how the plant maintains normal vegetative growth when sink organs such as the grain do not develop and thereby import less c and n assimilates. at the v stage in the two gs mutants, the massive accumulation  of muscular lmna-interacting protein   <dig> mrnas encoding a leucine zipper transcription factor  involved in abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> , suggests that this protein is a major stress-responsive element induced in response to the lack of cytosolic gs activity. a 23 kda photosystem ii protein was also highly up-regulated with more than a 200-fold increase in mrna accumulation in the two mutants. when gs activity is reduced, the photosynthetic products are not used for grain filling and it is then possible that there is excess light, which exceeds the requirement of the plant to assimilate co <dig>  consequently, the light energy needs to be dissipated as thermal energy through an increase in the synthesis and repair of the pigment antenna of photosystem ii  <cit> .

the accumulation of transcripts for isoleucyl-trna synthetase in the two gs mutants is intriguing. although the role of this enzyme is well established in lower organisms, the information on its role in higher plants is scarce. based on the results obtained in microorganisms  <cit> , it is attractive to think that there are some important post-transcriptional modifications resulting from the lack of the gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  isoenzyme, which could modify gene codon recognition and thus the protein sequence. the increase in the steady state level of mrna encoding a putative mannitol transporter is also an interesting result. it is well established that such a monosaccharide transporter is involved in a variety of biological processes related to phloem function, resource allocation, plant defence and sugar signalling  <cit> .

compared to the v stage, there was a clear balance between the up- and down-regulated genes at the m stage. among the most strongly up-regulated genes , one encoding a cytochrome p <dig> monoxygenase cyp72a <dig>  was particularly interesting. moreover, this type of enzyme can be involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites that could be used as precursors of compounds such as lignin  <cit> . the changes in the accumulation of secondary metabolites observed in a previous study  <cit>  and in the present investigation , also indicate that lignin biosynthesis was altered, thus possibly affecting shoot structure and ear development  <cit> . in agreement with this hypothesis, a gene encoding a putative cinnamoyl-coa reductase, the first enzyme after the branch of the lignin biosynthetic pathway  <cit> , was also up-regulated. the strong accumulation of transcripts for a glycoside hydrolase, an enzyme involved in cell wall polysaccharide metabolism  <cit>  and the considerable decrease in the amount of mrna for an acid chitinase  <cit> , further support the hypothesis that there was some readjustment in the production of a number of structural compounds during plant growth and development. the increase in the amount of transcripts encoding an allene oxide cyclase is more difficult to interpret, but it is possible that an abiotic stress response mediated by jasmonic acid  <cit>  is induced when the gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  isoenzymes are not active. in addition to the number of metabolic and regulatory roles altered in the two gs mutants, an important reprogramming of translational and post-translational activity is likely to occur at the same time, since a number of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins and a rna recognition motif protein  <cit>  were present in larger amounts in both the gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutants. it is also worth noting that a number of genes of unknown function exhibited an altered level of expression.table  <dig>

integrated view of the differences in accumulation of metabolites, proteins and transcripts
as in a previous study aimed at integrating the three different “omics” investigations when maize plants were grown under n-limiting conditions  <cit> , we have made a similar attempt to integrate the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome datasets and the impact of the two gln <dig> mutations at two key stages of plant development. such an integrated “omics” picture can provide important information on the impact of the two gln <dig> mutations on the physiological adaptation of the plant. irrespective of their biological functions, the quantitative differences observed in mrna transcript, protein and metabolite accumulation in relation to the plant developmental stage are presented in table  <dig>  in addition, the relative importance of these processes in terms of number of metabolites, proteins and transcripts exhibiting differences within common functional categories across the three “omic” studies is presented in figure  <dig>  the most important differences were generally observed at the transcript accumulation level, regardless of the plant developmental stage.figure  <dig>

fewer variations in functional diversity were observed at the metabolome level, although changes in c and n metabolites and to a lesser extent secondary metabolites, precursors of cell wall synthesis, were the main consequences of the gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutations . nevertheless, it is clear that the process that is the most strongly affected in the two gln <dig> mutants is c metabolism, irrespective of the mutation and of the plant developmental age. important changes in the accumulation of leaf c metabolites, mostly represented by soluble sugars, sugar alcohols and organic acids were the main consequences of n deficiency  <cit> , a metabolic signature that is similar to that described here in the two gs mutants . such a finding is consistent with the now established hypothesis that the reaction catalysed by the enzyme gs is the major route facilitating the incorporation of inorganic n into organic molecules  <cit> .

interestingly, the gln <dig>  mutation had only a limited impact on n metabolism across the three “omics” components, both at the v and the m plant developmental stage. in the gln <dig>  mutant, simultaneous changes in metabolites, proteins and transcript accumulation related to n assimilation and recycling were only observed at the m stage. this observation is consistent with the finding that the bundle sheath-specific gs <dig>  isoform is encoded by a gene induced during leaf aging, which plays a catabolic role in the reassimilation of ammonium released during protein degradation in senescing leaves at the m stage  <cit> .

in a similar manner to the n-deficient growth conditions investigated by  <cit> , in at least two of the three “omics” experiments, the synthesis of cell wall components, as well as stress and defence mechanisms were altered in the two gs mutants. these alterations include the accumulation of marker metabolites for stress conditions, which agrees with the observation that c metabolism, lignin biosynthesis and stress-responsive elements are co-ordinately regulated  <cit> . although throughout the plant life cycle, both at the transcriptome and proteome level, a number of stress-responsive elements and plant defence mechanisms specific for the plant developmental stage were up- or down-regulated in the two gs mutants , in a similar manner to when n is limiting  <cit> .

differences in the protein profile of the two gs mutants in comparison to the wt were relatively minor, again comparable with the impact of n limitation on the leaf proteome  <cit> . moreover these proteins were involved in a limited number of plant biological functions. one explanation is that some of the low-abundance structural, or regulatory proteins cannot be detected using 2-d gel electrophoresis in comparison to a maize pan-transcriptome. it is also possible that the decrease in gs <dig> activity, may involve a number of post-translational protein modifications that were not investigated in the present study. it is likely that such post-translational modifications occur in the leaf proteome of the gs mutants, since two different protein spots for the same sequence were identified for the enzyme fructose-bisphosphate aldolase  and for ferredoxin .

CONCLUSIONS
increasing amounts of “omics” data are available related to the response of both model and crop plants to short-term and long-term n-deficiency and other abiotic stresses   <cit> . however, linking these data to a plant phenotype in terms of plant growth, development and yield remains a challenge. this is mainly because, as shown in the present study and a number of other recent investigations  <cit> , when examining individually the biological systems involved, there is only a single level of complexity, which increases when their interactions are considered  <cit> . moreover, there is often very little direct correlation between differences in the accumulation of metabolites, proteins and mrna transcripts  <cit> , due to the complexity inherent in biological networks and to the fact that both tissue and cellular compartmentation within different organs are generally not taken into account. this metabolomic study performed on the gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutants should also be carried out using labelled molecules in a fluxomic study  <cit>  performed on individual organs harvested at the v and the m stage.

nevertheless, the most interesting finding in this study is that in two separate mutants in which a different cytosolic gs isoenzyme has been deleted, a number of major biological processes such as c metabolism and transport, cell wall metabolism, and several metabolic pathways and stress responsive and regulatory elements, share common or specific characteristics across at least two or even three of the “omics” considered. some of these biological processes are specific or common to the two gs mutants depending on the plant developmental stage. they are represented in figure  <dig> and can be summarized as follow: in the gln <dig>  mutant the decrease in the accumulation of amino acids occurring during the v stage is due to a decrease in n assimilation resulting in a decrease in the number of kernels. during this period, the lack of amino acids induced an accumulation of organic acids that are normally used as c skeletons for amino acid synthesis, the n residues being provided by glutamine. an accumulation of stress-responsive metabolites was also observed similar to that which occurred when there is a shortage in n. since fewer kernels were produced, carbohydrates synthesized, or exported during the grain filling period accumulated in the leaves. in the gln <dig>  mutant, the main changes observed in terms of metabolite accumulation mostly occurred during the grain filling period, when the amino acids were released during n remobilisation. these amino acids were not used to fill the kernels, thus limiting their development. during the grain filling period, an accumulation of cell wall components took place in both gs mutants, which indicates that the reduction in either kernel number or kernel size had strong repercussions on the basic structure of source organs, presumably to circumvent the decrease in storage capacity of the sink organs.figure  <dig>

gln <dig> 
and
gln <dig> 
mutants. on the top of the figure is shown a schematic representation of leaf n management in maize during the developmental cycle. during vegetative growth , n is taken up by the roots and assimilated to build up plant cellular structures . after flowering the n accumulated in the vegetative parts of the plant is remobilized and translocated to the developing kernels. at the same time , which corresponds to the grain filling period , about half of the n that is translocated to the developing kernels is taken up after flowering to contribute to storage protein deposition until the kernels reach maturity. during these two main phases of plant development the large arrows indicate the different biological functions that exhibit the most significant decrease  or increase  in the gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutants. the physiological impact of the two mutations is indicated below the green and yellow arrows in italics, which corresponds to the two main phases of leaf n management before and after flowering.



it will be necessary to exploit further “omics” data such as those obtained with the gln <dig>  and gln <dig>  mutants, in order to improve our understanding of the source to sink relationship in terms of maize productivity. this can be achieved by linking genes and metabolic functions to physiological or agronomic traits, through the construction of whole genome-scale metabolic models  <cit> . the ultimate goal of developing such models is to provide a new tool for predicting crop yields that will allow the selection of crops adapted to lower inputs and to particular environmental conditions, while maintaining an acceptable yield. the knowledge gained from such modelling approaches could ultimately allow for the identification of key developmental and metabolic components involved in the elaboration of complex agronomic traits such as biomass and grain production.

the “omics” data obtained by growing plants under varying n conditions and by analysing genetically modified plants and mutants altered in the expression of structural or regulatory genes, can be incorporated in the model even if the genes do not have a direct link with primary c and n metabolism. such data could provide a more accurate simulation of the impact of the genetic alteration on the metabolic interactions and fluxes throughout the plant. subsequently, such a modelling approach could allow the identification of key reactions controlling plant growth and development under different n fertilisation or stress conditions  <cit> .

furthermore, the genes identified in the transcriptome studies, which were found to be the most strongly up- or down-regulated in the present investigation , can be placed on a maize genetic map. in this way, co-localisations with qtls for phenotypic traits related to leaf or ear growth and development, biomass production and grain yield can be identified in both vegetative and reproductive organs  <cit> . validation of these candidate genes exhibiting a strong alteration in their level of expression and co-localizing with phenotypic qtls can then be undertaken using transgenic technologies, mutagenesis, or by association genetics, either at the single gene or genome-wide level.
