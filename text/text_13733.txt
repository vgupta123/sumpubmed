BACKGROUND
crambe  belongs to the brassicaceae plant family. the seed oil of crambe contains a high content of erucic acid  and this oil thus has applications as industrial oil  <cit> . erucic acid in form of erucamide, a major derivative from c22: <dig>  can be used as slip agent in plastics, or lubricants, nylon and cosmetics  <cit> . more recently, crambe oil is considered to be potential to produce biofuel  <cit> . the cultivation of crambe yields up to 1 t ha- <dig> of oil, comparative to that of high erucic acid rapeseed . furthermore, the processing costs for crambe oil extraction are in the same range of that for rapeseed  <cit> . the high yield and the fact that crambe is not able to cross with food oil crops in nature make crambe an ideal platform to produce industrial oils  <cit> . in addition to high erucic acid , crambe oil contains also certain amounts of oleic acid , linoleic acid  and linolenic acid .

the value of crambe oil can be further improved not only by increasing the c22: <dig> content but also by reducing the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids . firstly, an increase in c22: <dig> can reduce the purification cost of c22: <dig> from c18-fatty acids. it was estimated that 10% increase of c22: <dig> in oil would reduce the processing costs by half  <cit> . secondly, reduction in pufa is beneficial for storage and extending the shelf life of the oil because pufa are highly prone to oxidation during storage <cit> . thirdly, high pufa content causes higher viscosity for the oil   <cit> . considerable efforts have been made to reduce pufa in oil. a common chemical approach is to reduce the pufa content or increase the c18: <dig> content through hydrogenation  <cit> . however, this hydrogenating process is expensive and adds extra  <dig> to  <dig> cent per pound cost to the price of oil  <cit> .

molecular breeding approaches to change composition of seed oil are targeting important genes involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, which have been intensively studied and many genes involved have been characterized. in short, c18: <dig> is de novo synthesized in plastids and transported into the endoplasmic reticulum where the c18: <dig> is incorporated into phosphatidylcholine  and may undergo desaturation to c18: <dig> and next to c18: <dig> by the actions of two microsomal enzymes; delta-12-fatty acid desaturase   and delta-15-fatty acid desaturase  , respectively  <cit> . alternatively, c18: <dig> may undergo elongation to very long chain fatty acids  by the action of fatty acid elongation  complex  <cit> . mutant and genetic mapping studies showed that the enzyme fad <dig> was found to be mainly responsible for c18: <dig> and pufa content although fad <dig> also contributes to a limited degree to these traits  <cit> . in addition, the acyl flux between the two pathways, the prokaryotic  and eukaryotic  pathway, is influencing the c18: <dig> pool  <cit> .

genetic modification  aimed at regulating the fad <dig> expression has been applied to produce oils with higher c18: <dig> in various oil crops  <cit> . for example, by anti-sense suppression of fad <dig> in brassica juncea, a transgenic line was obtained that produced oil with higher c18: <dig>  and lower pufa  compared to the wild type   <cit> . similarly, a significant change in c18: <dig> and pufa and even a c22: <dig> increase in the seed oil was observed when silencing fad <dig> with both co-suppression and anti-sense in brassica carinata <cit> . gene silencing by rnai has been considered to be a particularly efficient way to obtain stable transgenic plants with the silenced target genes  <cit> . rnai-mediated silencing of ghfad <dig> in cotton enabled over 60% increase in c18: <dig>  <cit> . simultaneous rnai-mediated silencing of fad <dig> and fae <dig> in brassica napus caused not only significant increase in c18: <dig> , but also reduction in c22: <dig> and pufa   <cit> . recently, several efficient protocols for crambe transformation are available  <cit>  and rnai has shown to be an effective gene knockdown tool for crambe where cafad <dig> rnai gene silencing resulted in increased c18: <dig> levels   <cit> . introduction of two heterologous genes, ldlpaat and bnfae <dig>  in such cafad2-rnai lines directed the oil biosynthesis towards the incorporation of c22: <dig> at the sn- <dig> position of triacylglycerol, thereby the c22: <dig> level increased from 60% in the wild type to 73% in the best transgenic crambe line  <cit> .

an obstacle to adaptation of such genetic modified  crops is the lack of broad acceptance by a part of the community in many countries  <cit> . furthermore, there are some cases where rnai-mediated traits are not completely reliable on the long term in generating stable target gene suppression  <cit> . currently, breeding of the allo-hexaploid crambe mainly relies on traditional approaches, however, the possibilities are restricted by the lack of genetic variation for important agronomic traits  <cit> . in such situations and particularly when genes controlling a phenotype are known, mutation breeding of induced or natural mutations, identified via “tilling”   <cit> , offers a reliable, stable, non-gm approach to obtain the desired oil quality in crambe. a drawback is that “tilling” is still a challenging task in polyploid crops, where the multiple alleles are creating problems in identifying desirable genetic changes due to gene redundancy. despite these problems successful cases of targeted mutagenesis have been reported in polyploid crops  <cit> . for instance, targeted mutation breeding of natural or induced variation in the fad <dig> gene or mining natural variants has been used to develop crops with high c22: <dig> or less pufa  <cit> . by combining mutations or natural variants of fad <dig> and fad <dig>  it was possible to produce oils with higher c18: <dig> and lower c18: <dig> in soybean and brassica napus <cit> . in the allo-hexaploid genome of crambe abyssinica cv. 'galactica’ seven fad <dig> genes are present, of which only three are transcriptionally active throughout plant development   <cit> . the possibility of functional redundancy among the active cafad <dig> family members may complicate the gain of crambe lines with desirable oil composition via mutation breeding.

the aim of the present study is to specify which of the fad <dig> genes in crambe is the key gene for increasing the c18: <dig> level, but reducing the pufa content. fad2-rnai lines of crambe cv. 'galactica’ were studied for functional correlations between the individual cafad <dig> family members, cafad2-c <dig>  cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig> and seed-oil composition. seed-oil composition and gene expression studies were performed in two independent families of the second generation transgenic lines . in addition, two other genes, cafad <dig> and cafae <dig> that are acting in close connection to cafad <dig>  were also involved in the study.

RESULTS
cafad2-rnai lines
we have previously shown that the major expressed cafad <dig> gene in developing crambe seeds is cafad2-c <dig>  while the other two genes cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig> are naturally expressed to much lower levels   <cit> . a dna fragment of cafad2-c <dig>  sharing 97% and 96% nucleotide identity with cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig> respectively, was used to trigger rnai-mediated silencing of the cafad <dig> genes in crambe. two primary transgenic plants  that showed significantly lower contents of c18: <dig> and c18: <dig>  but higher level of c18: <dig> in the seed-oil were used in this study  <cit> . for these two independent transgenic lines, the effect of rnai-silencing on the expression of the individual cafad <dig> genes and the composition of the seed-oil were analysed for the seeds produced by the first generation  and the second generation . in the t <dig> generation the transgene copy number was determined and the relative gene-expression of the individual genes was correlated to differences in seed-oil composition to determine the effect of silencing of the individual cafad <dig> gene.

cafad <dig> gene-silencing and oil composition in t1-generation
among six individual plants analysed, simultaneous but moderate silencing of all three cafad <dig> genes  was found only in one plant, wg4- <dig>  in two plants wg19- <dig> and wg19- <dig> no signs of gene-silencing was observed. in the remaining three plants  no silencing was detected for cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig> whereas cafad2-c <dig> was silenced to different levels whereby a strong silencing of cafad2-c <dig>  was detected in plant wg4- <dig> followed by a moderate level of cafad2-c <dig> silencing  in wg4- <dig> and wg19- <dig> . to measure the final effect of gene-silencing, the oil composition was determined for around  <dig> single ripe seeds per plant. despite the fact that clear silencing was only detected in the developing seeds of one plant , the contents of c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> in the seeds of all six plants were significantly different to that of the control . the c18: <dig> content was found to be 6% to  <dig> % above the control, and the content of pufa  was a concomitant  <dig> % to  <dig> % lower than the control. regarding c22: <dig> content, the plants wg4- <dig>  wg4- <dig> and wg19- <dig> scored significantly higher than the control by respectively  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  whereas the remaining three plants showed no significant difference to the control .

c. abyssinica


the fatty acid composition in single seed was measured, and for each line several seeds were used for measurement. kruskal-wallis test was run to determine significance level of difference between the fad2-rnai lines and the control. a: sd = standard deviation. significance levels: *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig> .

an explanation for the fact that the level of cafad <dig> silencing and the oil composition are not clearly correlated in t <dig> generation may reside in differences in zygosity level of the transgene copies among the t1-plants. as the expression profile was analysed on bulks of five to ten seeds, variation in transgene copy number and the presence of seeds that have segregated to the wild-type may mask the silencing effect. indeed, among the fatty acid profiles of the individual seeds of wg4- <dig> and wg19- <dig> segregation to the wild-type oil composition was observed .

cafad <dig> silencing and oil composition in t2-generation
two t1-plants  with stable and high c18: <dig> content were chosen to develop a second generation for an extensive study of the inheritance of the “high c18: <dig>  low pufa” oil-phenotype and to examine the correlation between silencing of the respective cafad <dig> genes, the oil composition and the expression of two other genes involved in the seed oil biosynthesis .

transgene copy-number
seventeen t2-plants  were randomly selected and characterised for the number of transgene insertion by southern analysis. four or five transgene insertions were detected in the progeny of wg19- <dig> with a similar pattern. in contrast, a single insertion was detected in all five analysed progeny plants of wg4- <dig> .

cafad <dig> gene-silencing
to test whether and to what extent rnai-mediated gene-silencing was effective in the t2-plants, the expression levels of cafad2-c <dig>  cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig> in developing seeds  were quantified for all twenty-two t2-plants by qrt-pcr. the relative expression levels were calculated relative to the average expression level of the respective genes in the control. collectively, down-regulation of gene expression is clearly detectable in the t2-plants of both t <dig> families, wg4- <dig> and wg19- <dig>  differential patterns of silencing are observed for all three cafad <dig> genes . the major cafad <dig> gene expressed in crambe seed, cafad2-c <dig>  is strongly silenced  in all seven t2-plants of the wg4- <dig> family and in  <dig> out of 15 t2-plants of the wg19- <dig> family. only in a single plant, wg19-6- <dig>  minor silencing of cafad2-c <dig> is observed  .

in contrast to the constant and strong silencing of cafad2-c <dig>  more variation in silencing is found for cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig> in both families. in the single copy transgenic t2-plants of the wg4- <dig> family, cafad2-c <dig> showed strong silencing in almost half  of the wg4- <dig> family  whereas in the other t2-plants of wg4- <dig> this gene was not silenced . in the other family, wg19- <dig>  60% of the t2-plants  showed strong silencing of cafad2-c <dig> whereas the rest showed zero- to moderate silencing of cafad2-c <dig>  also, cafad2-c <dig> showed various silencing levels in both t <dig> families with strong silencing in three wg4-4 t <dig> -plants  and five wg19-6 t2-plants  .

the average expression levels of the respective genes were calculated for each t <dig> family in comparison with the control. in both families , only the expression of cafad2-c <dig> is constantly and significantly different to the average control level . for cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig>  the average expression levels in both families are not significantly different from the average expression level observed in the control .

inheritance of cafad <dig> silencing
as compared over two generations , the level of silencing in wg19- <dig>  the line which carries multiple transgene insertions, increased from zero silencing in the t <dig> to ~40%, 60% and 70% reduction for respectively cafad2-c <dig>  -c <dig> and -c <dig> in the t <dig>  over two generations, t <dig> and t <dig>  of the single copy transgene wg4- <dig> the expression patterns of the cafad <dig> genes were similar. in both generations, only cafad2-c <dig> was dominantly down-regulated in expression .

effect of cafad <dig> silencing on cafad <dig> and cafae <dig> expression
as a consequence of cafad <dig> gene silencing, and accompanying changes in the substrate flow in the oil biosynthesis pathway, the expression of other genes acting in the pathway may change. therefore, the expression of two genes, fad <dig>  involved in the conversion of c18: <dig> to c18: <dig>  and fae <dig>  acting in the production of very long chain fatty acids  by chain-elongation of c18: <dig>  were studied in the two t <dig> families  and the control. both genes showed differential expression among the individual plants within families, but on average no significant differences were observed between the two t <dig> families and the control . notably, cafad <dig> and cafae <dig> showed a similar regulation pattern because both of them were up- or down-regulated within the same plant with exception of two plants, wg19-6- <dig> and wg19-6- <dig> .

oil composition
the observed changes in expression pattern of the target genes resulted in significant changes in seed oil composition in 21 t2-plants studied . in accordance with the results found in the t <dig> generation, the contents of c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> showed significant differences to the control . however, the high c22: <dig> content found in the oil of two t1-plants  was not observed throughout the entire t <dig> offspring of these plants. the c22: <dig> content showed significant differences to the control in only four t2-plants  in which c22: <dig> levels were about 2% higher  than the control level . compared to the control , the c18: <dig> contents in the oil of all the t2-plants were clearly higher  and ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, and most of the t2-plants  showed a c18: <dig> content of more than 20% . consequently, the pufa  contents in these plants were lower  than the control  and ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, and in 67%  of the plants the pufa content was below 5% .

overall, seeds from the two t <dig> families  contained different c18: <dig> and pufa contents compared to the control  . among both t <dig> families, the content of c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c22: <dig> and pufa showed no significant difference . however, family wg19- <dig> showed more variation in both c18: <dig> and pufa contents than family wg4- <dig> .

correlation between gene expression and oil composition
to investigate the relationship between differential expression levels of the target genes in the t <dig> generation and the oil composition, correlation analysis was carried out. all the correlations and coefficients are plotted in figure  <dig>  among the individual t <dig> plants of wg4- <dig> and wg19- <dig> that showed differential cafad <dig> expression levels, some significant correlations were observed for the expression levels of cafad2-c <dig> to -c <dig>  cafad <dig> and cafae <dig>  overall, the expression of cafae <dig> is co-ordinately regulated with both, cafad <dig>  and cafad2-c <dig>  . these correlations are much stronger in the wg4- <dig> family . regarding the oil composition, the contents of both c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> were negatively related  to the c18: <dig> content. however, the c22: <dig> content was not significantly related to the observed changes in other oil compounds  . in accordance with its function in the oil biosynthesis pathway, the expression level of cafad2-c <dig> is negatively related to the c18: <dig> content  and positively related to the contents of c18: <dig>  and c18: <dig>  . however, there were no correlations found between these fatty acids and the expression of other genes .

discussion
c. abyssinica, an under-utilized crop, has limited genetic variation and the improvement of crambe oil by traditional breeding has reached a bottleneck. recently, using a genetic engineering approach, crambe lines with a desirable oil type have been obtained by silencing cafad <dig> genes  <cit> . in c. abyssinica, three functional fad <dig> genes are present   <cit> . even though the functional defect of one of the family members may be complemented by the other members of the gene family  <cit> , one or few of these family members usually play a predominant role, so that a primary functional analysis of gene family members is normally required prior to mutation breeding  <cit> . our study was initiated to characterise the effect of the three functional cafad <dig> genes  to determine the appropriate targets for a targeted mutation approach  to develop non-gm crambe lines with novel oil types.

here we used a construct containing a part of the cafad2-c <dig> sequence, which is 96% to 97% identical to the sequences of other expressed cafad <dig> genes, to obtain seed-specific silencing  of the endogenous cafad <dig> gene family members in crambe. the results proved that one rnai trigger is able to affect the expression of multiple members of the gene family but in different patterns . in t2-plants, the main fad <dig> gene expressed in crambe seeds, cafad2-c <dig>  is strongly silenced whereas the two lower expressed genes, cafad2-c <dig> and -c <dig> , are silenced to different levels ranging from strong- to zero silencing. the reason why no reduction of cafad <dig> gene expression was detected in two t1-plants , which nevertheless showed significant difference for seed-oil composition, is probably due to the heterozygous nature of the seed samples. this can cause that segregating wild-type seeds can be present in the seed bulks used for expression analysis, whereas the oil composition was measured on single seeds. another possibility is that silencing in these lines took place in the developing seeds at other time points beyond the expression peak at 20 days after pollination . indeed, the results of southern analysis do suggest that the t1-plant wg19- <dig> is heterozygous, because a varying number of transgene insertions was detected in its offspring , and also that wg4- <dig>  is most likely homozygous because a single transgene insertion was observed in all randomly tested progeny  of wg4- <dig> .

over two generations , the expression patterns of cafad <dig> in wg4- <dig>  carrying a single transgene insertion, were similar whereas differences in silencing levels over generations were observed for wg19- <dig>  the multiple transgene insertions in wg19- <dig> may cause different types of variation in the t <dig> population, which may influence the level of silencing. it is known that trace amount of dsrna is sufficient to trigger gene silencing  <cit>  and the degree of silencing has no association with insert copy number  <cit> . therefore, a plausible explanation to different silencing levels over t <dig> and t <dig> generations of wg19- <dig> is that a higher level of homozygosity in the seeds of the t <dig> generation leads to a lower number of segregating wild type seeds, which is of importance if the seeds are analysed for expression “in bulk”.

the t <dig> progenies of two fad2-rnai plants  were tested in detail for the level of gene expression of the different cafad <dig> gene family members  and for oil composition . the results showed that the silencing of gene expression is stably inherited to the subsequent generation. the stability of rnai-silencing was also reflected at the seed-oil composition, for instance, in the t2-progeny of wg4- <dig>  the c18: <dig> level was significantly higher and pufa level was significantly lower than those of the control plants . the values of important individual oil compounds are close to the average of the parental t1-plants for both lines, wg4- <dig> and wg19- <dig>  indicating that the high c18: <dig> and low pufa traits were stably transmitted to the subsequent generation.

correlation and expression regulation analysis
compared to cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig>  cafad2-c <dig> was strong and stably silenced by the seed specific rnai trigger. on average, silencing of cafad2-c <dig> is constantly significant in both t <dig> families . although some t2-plants show a clear silencing of cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig>  the overall family average of these genes are not significantly different from the control for both families. consequently, the only significant difference in gene expression observed between the two t <dig> families is the difference in cafad2-c <dig> expression .

taken together with the fact that a change in oil composition was found in all t2-plants and that out of the three cafad <dig> genes cafad2-c <dig> is the highest expressor in developing crambe seeds  <cit> , it is most likely that this gene plays a direct role in seed oil synthesis. this idea is supported by the study on the seed-oil of individual t2-plants . based on the differential silencing of cafad2-c <dig> among t <dig> plants of both families and the silencing of cafad2-c <dig> observed in several individual t <dig> plants, there is no clear evidence showing that the expression of these two genes is correlated to changes in the seed oil composition . furthermore, the changes in oil composition due to cafad2-c3-silencing were not complemented in individual t2-plants in which cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig> were unaffected and expressed to wild-type levels.

the trait of high c18: <dig> is controlled by quantitative trait loci and thus needs coordinated regulation of multiple loci  <cit> . previous studies proved that the fad <dig> gene plays an essential role for this trait  <cit> . in addition, fad <dig>  fae <dig> and other loci with minor effect are likely required to establish high c18: <dig> pool during oil biosynthesis  <cit> . in this study, we also investigated the regulation of fad <dig> and fae <dig> while silencing the cafad <dig> genes. it is known that fad <dig> and fae <dig> are regulated by abscisic acid  <cit> . herein, we found that the expression of fae <dig> is positively related to that of fad <dig> and one of the fad <dig> genes, cafad2-c <dig> . this finding is consistent to previous studies in which these functionally related genes  showed coordinated regulation in arabidopsis and brassica napus <cit> . however, it is unknown why the other two cafad <dig> genes do not show a similar co-regulation with fad <dig> and fae <dig> 

the cafad2-c <dig> gene is a target gene for crambe oil improvement by mutation breeding
here, we show that cafad2-c <dig> is the main cafad2-gene involved in determining the c18: <dig> and pufa contents in crambe oil . embryo tissue is the main compartment of oil storage in crambe seed, so the oil composition in the seeds is mainly determined by that in the embryo. therefore, cafad2-c <dig> is most likely responsible for fatty acid synthesis in the embryo. the other two genes, cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig>  might be responsible to change fatty acid contents in other seed compartments . for instance in olive , two fad <dig> genes  are expressed both in two seed compartments, seed coat and embryo. of these two oefad <dig> genes, the expression of oefad2- <dig> was positively correlated to c18: <dig> content in the seed coat rather than in the embryo under cold condition  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the finding that the prominent role of cafad2-c <dig> is further substantiated by the observation that the effect on oil-composition caused by cafad2-c <dig> silencing is not restored in individual t2-plants with wild-type expression of cafad2-c <dig> and -c <dig> respectively. this finding suggests that cafad2-c <dig> may provide an important target gene for tilling and mutation breeding aiming at pronounced changes of c18: <dig> and pufa in crambe oil.
