BACKGROUND
ghrelin, a hormone with many physiological and pathophysiological roles, was initially described as the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor , through which it stimulates the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary  <cit> . ghrelin is primarily produced in the stomach and plays a key role in regulating appetite, gut motility and energy balance  <cit> . ghrelin is also an autocrine factor in a number of tissues, as it regulates insulin release and has therapeutic potential for inflammatory diseases, heart disease, cancer cachexia, diabetes mellitus and obesity  <cit> . despite the importance of ghrelin in a range of physiological systems and pathophysiological conditions, little is known about the regulation of ghrelin synthesis and secretion. we previously identified a gene on the opposite strand of the ghrelin gene, ghrelinos , which spans the promoter and untranslated regions of the ghrelin gene   <cit> . however, the genomic structure, expression pattern and potential function of ghrlos remains to be investigated. it is not known whether ghrlos rna species with open reading frames exist, or whether ghrlos is a non-coding rna gene.

there is strong support for the hypothesis that antisense transcripts provide a widespread and important mechanism for the regulation of the human genome  <cit> . our understanding of the genome is currently undergoing a paradigm shift, as a previously hidden and complex layer of antisense and non-coding rnas is emerging, which controls gene transcription and translation through a diverse range of mechanisms  <cit> . much phenotypic diversity between humans and other species is likely to be due to regulation by rna  <cit> .

in this study, we examined the genomic structure and organisation of ghrlos. we have found that ghrlos spans approximately  <dig> kb of genomic dna and transcribes long, 5' capped, polyadenlyated rna species that are extensively spliced and differentially expressed. high levels of ghrlos expression occur in the emerging non-coding rna tissues, the brain, testis and thymus. we have also examined ghrlos rna species in silico, revealing that ghrlos is a candidate non-coding rna gene. these data provide a strong basis for further functional studies to determine whether ghrlos plays a role in the regulation of ghrelin gene expression.

RESULTS
characterisation of ghrlos start sites and alternative splicing
an initial aim of this study was to characterise ghrlos in a range of tissues. as we have previously demonstrated the expression of ghrlos mrna transcripts in the human stomach  <cit> , we performed 5' rlm-race  on this tissue. unexpectedly, we identified a number of new exons   that are  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb upstream of the previously reported ghrlos transcription start sites  <cit>  in exon 4* . to simplify the numbering of ghrlos exons, the previously reported  <cit>  exons 4*, 2**, 2* and -1* have been renamed exon  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively; while the exons upstream of the reported start sites in exon  <dig> are denoted by roman numerals . importantly, in the ghrlos variants demonstrated via 5' rlm-race, exon  <dig> is extended, with a  <dig> nt region  overlapping exon  <dig> of the ghrelin gene . the novel first exon, exon i, is  <dig> bp in size  and overlaps the 3' untranslated region of the adjacent gene, tatdn <dig>   <cit> . this gene initiates on the same dna strand as ghrlos, approximately  <dig>  base pairs upstream of the  <dig> bp exon i of ghrlos.

in order to determine the polyadenylation site of ghrlos transcripts, 3' race and inverse pcr were conducted using normal stomach and prostate tissues, the rwpe- <dig> prostate cell line and the pc <dig> prostate cancer cell line . we obtained 3' race clones from the pc <dig> prostate cancer cell line, which demonstrated a  <dig>  kb exon 4a and a  <dig>  kb exon 4b, with the putative polyadenylation signal aaatta  . the 3' race data matches a number of expressed sequence tags  from subchondral bone , foetal liver , pooled liver and spleen , wilms' tumour  , pooled brain cancers  and high grade serous carcinoma of the uterus . moreover, we performed uncapped inverse pcr, and sequencing of amplicons from the pc <dig> cell line revealed a  <dig> bp exon i and exon  <dig> sequence with a 3' end differing by less than  <dig> base pairs when compared to the 3' race and reported ests . interestingly, the putative 3' end of exon  <dig> corresponds to publicly available affymetrix human exon  <dig>  st array data . furthermore, all of the amplicons that we obtained were followed by a stretch of adenosines at the 3' ends that are not present in the genomic sequence. we, therefore, concluded that we had reached a genuine 3' end of ghrlos.

complex pattern of ghrlos variant exon expression
in order to examine the size and tissue distribution of ghrlos transcripts, we performed northern blot analysis of mrna from human stomach and  <dig> normal, human tissues. with a riboprobe designed to span exons i, ii,  <dig> and  <dig> of ghrlos, a weak, smeared signal ranging from approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb in size was observed in the human stomach upon a lengthened exposure time . a riboprobe spanning exon  <dig> alone  resulted in signals ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb in size in the pancreas, prostate, salivary gland and thymus . upon longer exposure times, a smear in the  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb range was seen in all tissues, except for peripheral blood leukocytes and urinary bladder . this suggests that ghrlos is a fully processed transcript consisting of many mrna isoforms.

ghrlos exons are highly polymorphic
the race, inverse rt-pcr and northern blotting experiments indicate that ghrlos is extensively spliced and that isoforms range greatly in size . to examine the alternative splicing pattern of ghrlos in greater detail, we performed rt-pcr using a range of human tissues and cell lines. we used a forward primer common to exon ia  and a reverse primer in a region common to exons 4a and b. sequence analysis indicated that, with the exception of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which are common to all known ghrlos isoforms, ghrlos exons are highly polymorphic in size and exon skipping occurs frequently. a representative amplicon banding pattern is shown in . the highly variable splicing pattern revealed by rt-pcr is consistent with the diffuse and broad signal which we detected by northern blotting. in total we obtained  <dig> different ghrlos splice variants . analysis using gmap, a genomic mapping and alignment program for mrna and est sequences  <cit> , indicated that all ghrlos exons are flanked by canonical splice donor and acceptor sites , except for exons 3a and 3c where the splice junction is the common non-canonical splice pair gc/ag  <cit> . ghrlos exons and introns identified are listed in .

extending the known length of ghrlos
northern blotting demonstrated ghrlos transcripts 1– <dig>  kb in size, however, further rt-pcr and 3' race analysis with a number of different primer combinations failed to reveal ghrlos transcripts larger than  <dig> kb . for this reason, we hypothesised that the ghrelin antisense gene may extend further upstream. capped rlm-race of stomach tissue and uncapped inverse pcr of the pc <dig> prostate cancer cell line  indicated that a ghrlos promoter  was present at the very end of the  <dig> kb 3' untranslated exon  <dig> of tatdn <dig>  moreover, we discovered that multiple cap analysis of gene expression  tags are clustered approximately  <dig>  kb upstream of the ghrlos transcription start sites found via 5' rlm-race. cage tags are an average of 20– <dig> nucleotides and are produced by large-scale sequencing of concatemers derived from the 5' ends of capped mrna  <cit> . the cage method, therefore, detects the most 5' site of the mrna transcripts  and gives an unbiased and comprehensive picture of the positions and usage of transcription start sites  <cit> . to confirm if this region belongs to ghrlos, we employed nested rt-pcr using thymus tissue, foetal brain tissue and hep g <dig> hepatocarcinoma cell line cdna  primers). the forward primers were present immediately downstream of the cage tag cluster  and the reverse primers spanned exon  <dig> . sequence analysis revealed several novel exon i variants, which were approximately  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length. all of these variants spliced into the expected acceptor site of the  <dig> bp exon  <dig> . the end of the  <dig> bp exon i  spanned the  <dig> bp exon i  identified via capped rlm-race of the stomach, while the other exons  employed different upstream donor sites, suggesting that they are alternative first exons. the data demonstrate that there are at least two first ghrlos exon regions in the untranslated region of tatdn <dig>  this suggests that the ghrlos promoter is a broad-type, tata-less promoter that initiates transcription at many sites  <cit> .

the length of ghrlos transcripts initiating in exon i  is  <dig> – <dig>  kb, corresponding in size to the northern data. however, the potential identity of the approximately  <dig>  kb transcript seen in the northern blot with a full-length,  <dig> nt exon  <dig> probe  was not determined. after prolonged exposure of the northern blot, the  <dig>  kb transcript was observed in all tissues except the urinary bladder and uterus . tatdn <dig> is only approximately  <dig> kb upstream of exon ii and  <dig>  kb from exon  <dig> of ghrlos, suggesting that transcription-induced chimaeras  may be generated  <cit>  and give rise to large ghrlos transcripts. because tics must contain a first exon of the upstream gene  <cit> , we employed primers in exon  <dig>  of tatdn <dig> and exon  <dig> of ghrlos . using nested rt-pcr  primers), we isolated a  <dig> bp tatdn2-ghrlos amplicon from the thymus  . this transcript has canonical splice donor and acceptor sites  and splices into the expected acceptor site of the  <dig> bp exon  <dig>  this variant harbour significant open reading frames corresponding to the tatdn <dig> protein, but contains alternative exons and a premature termination codon more than  <dig> bp upstream of the final coding exon  <dig> of tatdn <dig> . this is likely to result in degradation of the mrna by nonsense-mediated rna decay , a surveillance mechanism that detects and degrades mrna that may encode truncated proteins with dominant-negative or deleterious gain-of-function activities  <cit> .

we have identified several novel ghrlos transcripts. this includes overlapping ghrlos transcripts initiating in the tatdn <dig> 3' utr and putative transcription-induced chimaeras of tatdn <dig> and ghrlos. these findings extend the previously reported length of ghrlos by ~ <dig> kb. we propose that ghrlos harbour several promoters with start sites in exon  <dig> , and in the 3' utr and the first exon of tatdn <dig> 

results of in silico analysis indicate that ghrlos is a non-coding rna gene
sequence analysis of ghrlos  reveals that ghrlos transcripts do not harbour protein coding potential, but rather have several features of non-coding rna genes. gmap analysis showed that ghrlos spans approximately  <dig> kb on 3p <dig>  . the mulan sequence conservation profile for the human and putative vertebrate ghrlos orthologues indicated that most ghrlos exons  are not highly conserved compared to the putative mouse and rat orthologues . the  <dig> bp exon  <dig>  and approximately  <dig> bp of the  <dig>  kb exon  <dig>  are conserved, however  <cit> . rt-pcr experiments revealed no evidence for antisense transcription from exon i to exon  <dig>  in the mouse , suggesting that ghrelin antisense transcription  may not be conserved. furthermore, there is very low sequence similarity between the chicken, frog, opossum and human ghrlos sequences . interestingly, exons ii,  <dig> and  <dig> appear to be highly conserved between human and dog , with 70–75% homology for exons  <dig> and  <dig>  however, no significant open reading frames  are conserved between dog and human ghrlos sequence . taken together, this suggests that ghrlos has evolved rapidly and may be unique to primates.

our study suggests that ghrlos is a non-coding rna. in silico translation revealed that the heterogeneous ghrlos rnas contain multiple stop codons, resulting in lack of extensive reading frames, and the putative orfs do not span conserved regions . moreover, no significant sequence similarity to any known proteins was observed . finally, screening of ghrlos sequence against a reference collection of repeats  using censor  <cit>  identified a  <dig> bp overlap of exon  <dig> with the extinct  <dig> bp mir <dig> sine element, which is present in all vertebrates  <cit>  . interestingly, the presence of repeat elements in exons of non-coding rnas has been reported previously  <cit> 

the ghrlos terminal exon  <dig> and a putative sec <dig> exon overlap in an antisense manner
we have discovered that exon  <dig> of ghrlos is also on the opposite strand of a novel terminal exon of the neighbouring sec <dig> gene in a tail-to-tail, 3' to 3', fashion  . sec <dig> plays an important role in protein transport and is a component of the copii complex  <cit> . blast analysis identified a brain tumour est   <cit> , which contains exon  <dig> and  <dig> of sec <dig>  as well as  <dig> bp sequence corresponding to a novel exon 9b of sec <dig>  <dig>  kb upstream of exon  <dig>  we verified the expression of this est by rt-pcr  primers)  and by sequencing . we have named this sec <dig> variant, sec13-tentative . sec13-t may encode a  <dig> amino acid protein. the first  <dig> amino acids are identical to sec <dig>  while the normal c-terminal  <dig> amino acids have been replaced by  <dig> amino acids encoded by the alternative terminal exon 9b . the putative c-terminal-coding exon of the sec13-t isoform appears to be conserved only in primates . therefore sec13-t alternative splicing is likely to be human-specific or primate-specific.

ghrlos is expressed in many tissues and cell lines and the level of expression shows great variability
rt-pcr analysis  and northern blotting  demonstrated that the size of ghrlos transcripts is highly variable, resulting in significant transcript heterogeneity. we, therefore, employed a quantitative, real-time rt-pcr approach in order to more precisely gauge the expression of ghrlos in a range of tissues and cell lines. as the number of alternatively spliced ghrlos transcripts makes it impossible to generate real-time rt-pcr primers that are unique to each splice variant , a strand-specific quantitative rt-pcr assay with primers in exon  <dig>  was designed to detect total ghrlos rna expression .

the level of total ghrlos transcript expression varied greatly in different human tissues, with high levels in the thymus, testis, foetal brain, uterus, cerebellum, ovary, thyroid, and whole brain. very low levels of total ghrlos rna expression were detected in the stomach, foetal liver and pancreas . in the thymus the level of expression was approximately  <dig> fold higher than in the stomach  and 110-fold higher than in the foetal liver . furthermore, the level of expression in the adult liver was 9-fold higher than in the foetal liver , indicating differential expression according to developmental stage in this tissue. the level of ghrlos in the foetal brain was two-fold higher than the adult brain, but this was not statistically significant .

expression of ghrlos in a number of continuous cell lines was also examined using real-time rt-pcr . levels of ghrlos expression in the u- <dig>  and sw <dig>  cell lines were similar to the cerebellum, uterus, foetal brain, testis and thymus. high levels of expression were observed in the hek <dig> human embryonic kidney cell line and in the caco- <dig> , saos- <dig> , u- <dig> mg and u251-mg , ovcar- <dig>  and hep g <dig>  cancer cell lines. it is interesting to note that multiple hep g <dig> cage tags have been identified in the exon i region of ghrlos . ghrlos rna appears to be significantly upregulated in the hep g <dig> cell line compared to adult and foetal liver  . this observation could indicate that ghrlos may be a specific target in the development of liver and other cancers.

comparison of total ghrlos and total ghrl expression
we examined the expression levels of the ghrl-ghrlos cis-natural antisense transcript  pair via quantitative real-time rt-pcr assays detecting total transcription from the ghrelin gene . as expected  <cit> , the highest level of ghrl expression was found in the stomach , followed by the testis and pancreas . when comparing total ghrelin and ghrlos rna expression in the stomach, ghrl was expressed at  <dig> fold higher levels than ghrlos, with ghrlos expression almost undetectable . the levels of ghrlos expression were higher than ghrl in the thymus, whole brain, the sw <dig> chondrosarcoma cell line, uterus and prostate. however, total ghrl rna levels were higher than ghrlos in the pancreas and the ovcar- <dig> ovarian cancer cell line.

discussion
our study demonstrates that ghrlos gives rise to long, extensively spliced, mrna-like, 5' capped and 3' polyadenylated transcripts suggesting that they are genuine products of rna polymerase ii mediated transcription  <cit> . we have shown that the ghrlos gene gives rise to transcripts  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb in size and has many broadly distributed transcription starts sites  . this includes several tsss in exon  <dig>  tsss overlapping the 3' utr of tatdn <dig> and evidence of transcription induced chimaeras employing tsss in the first exon of tatdn <dig>  the ghrelin locus, therefore, gives rise to many antisense transcripts that are currently annotated as a single gene, ghrlos. a well-described example of such complex architecture is the imprinted murine gnas locus, which gives rise to multiple coding and non-coding sense and antisense transcription units  <cit> .

first reported in  <dig>  <cit>  and originally thought to be a rarity, it has recently been established that promoters in 3' untranslated regions  are not uncommon and may be independently transcribed and regulated from their upstream "host gene"  <cit> . the encode  consortium has recently demonstrated that two-thirds of the loci in their dataset contain new putative first exons, which frequently overlap upstream genes  <cit> . however, it is currently not known how promoters that overlap 3' utrs are regulated and coordinated  <cit> . we have demonstrated ghrlos transcription start sites in the 3' utr of tatdn <dig> via rlm-race. the sequence upstream of exon i of ghrlos contains no apparent tata boxes , indicating that ghrlos has a broad type promoter, with many potential transcription start sites in the  <dig>  kb 3' utr of tatdn <dig>  this may allow the transcription of numerous tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific transcripts  <cit> . in addition, multiple cage tags are present in the 3' utr of tatdn <dig>  indicating that ghrlos transcripts initiate in this region.

interestingly, we also report the joining of exons of the neighbouring genes tatdn <dig> and ghrlos. similar chimaeric transcripts  have been reported in lower eukaryotes  <cit> , but were until recently assumed to be relatively rare in mammals  <cit> . it is not known how chimaeric transcripts arise, but transcriptional read-through, followed by canonical cis-splicing is the most likely mechanism  <cit> . alternatively, chimaeric transcripts could arise through trans-splicing, but the existence of this mechanism has not been well-established in mammals  <cit> . we, therefore, suggest that the chimaeric tatdn2-ghrlos transcripts probably result from a single pre-mrna, creating transcription-induced chimaeras  which are spliced in cis  <cit> . the tatdn2-ghrlos tic which was identified in the normal thymus harbours premature stop codons  and this is likely to result in nonsense-mediated decay . nmd is an rna surveillance mechanism  which targets mrna with premature stop codons that, if translated, encode truncated proteins with dominant-negative or deleterious gain-of function activities  <cit> . whilst we are not aware of any studies of the translated product of tatdn <dig> , tatd is a cytoplasmic protein that harbours magnesium-dependent dnase activity in e. coli  <cit> . proteins with a tatd domain, therefore, belong to the large superfamily of metalloenzymes. this suggests that the chimaeric transcripts may play a role in auto-regulation of the tatdn <dig> protein product, which we hypothesise is likely to be a dnase associated with apoptosis. we speculate that tatdn2-ghrlos chimaeras may be used to tightly regulate the programmed cell death of t-cells by downregulating the translation of the putative dnase tatdn <dig>  hillman and colleagues have termed this system of auto-regulation, where alternative splicing results in mrna isoforms that are not translated, regulated unproductive splicing and translation   <cit> . interestingly, it has very recently been reported that transcripts of the tumour suppressor protein e-cadherin that result in non-sense mediated decay are upregulated in gastric cancer, suggesting that nmd may also promote disease  <cit> .

we previously reported that ghrlos completely overlaps the ghrelin  gene  <cit> . here we also show that the 3' terminal exon  <dig> of ghrlos is present on the opposite  strand to a novel, 3' terminal sec <dig> exon . sec <dig> is a protein that forms a part of the coat protein complex ii   <cit> . copii proteins are required for the trafficking of nascent proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum  to the golgi apparatus. it also plays a role in the selection and concentration of cargo proteins for transport  <cit> . sec <dig>  <cit> , therefore, has a core endocrine function. ghrlos overlaps a novel sec <dig> variant, sec13-tentative . sec13-t may encode a  <dig> amino acid protein with a unique c-terminus. future studies are required to confirm the presence of full-length transcripts and to elucidate the functional role of sec13-t protein. we suggest that transcription of sec13-t may have implications for copii function in health and disease states. as ghrlos overlaps the terminal exons of both ghrl and sec13-t, the ghrlos natural antisense transcripts may regulate one or both of these genes.

ghrlos, a candidate non-coding rna
non-coding rnas are frequently not conserved between species, suggesting that they are either biological noise , or that they have species specific-functions. species-specific non-coding transcripts have been observed and there is strong evidence that non-coding transcripts are functionally significant  <cit> . interestingly it has recently been observed, using in silico analysis, that even between closely related drosophila species non-coding rnas are not conserved  <cit> . while the number of protein coding genes in distant eukaryotes  is approximately equal, the relative amount of non-coding dna increases in proportion to eukaryotic complexity  <cit> . mattick and colleagues explain this paradox by hypothesising that non-coding rnas have evolved to enable the emergence of organisms with increasingly complex higher levels functions  <cit> . our in silico analysis suggests that ghrlos exons show very low sequence conservation in vertebrate species. furthermore, exon  <dig> of ghrlos contains a transposable element, a feature observed in many non-coding rnas  <cit> .

our bioinformatic studies indicate that ghrlos does not encode a protein and, therefore, is a non-coding rna. taking into account the full-length sequence of ghrlos, the length of the open reading frames is very short. moreover, ghrlos rnas are numerous , contain a large number of stop codons and there is little nucleotide and putative amino acid conservation between vertebrates, making it less likely that this gene encodes proteins. although it has been suggested that many small peptides may be translated  <cit> , the majority of small peptides are processed from larger precursor proteins, as is ghrelin itself which is processed from preproghrelin. therefore, while it cannot be excluded that ghrlos encodes short orfs  it appears unlikely that ghrlos encodes biologically active peptides.

we examined the ghrlos expression profile to strengthen the hypothesis that it is a candidate non-coding rna. it has been demonstrated that mammalian long non-coding rnas are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, indicating that they are biologically significant  <cit> . in both humans and mice, the major tissues of non-coding expression are the complex organs; the brain, testis, and thymus  <cit> . this also holds true in drosophila, where the majority of the candidate non-coding rnas are expressed in the central nervous system  <cit> . indeed, non-coding rnas are emerging as important regulators of complex systems, such as the central nervous system  and intricate processes, including spermatogenesis in the testis  <cit> . we demonstrated high levels of ghrlos in the thymus, brain, testis, uterus, ovary and thymus, while the expression levels in the stomach, where ghrl is highly expressed  <cit> , were almost undetectable. our data demonstrate that ghrlos is predominantly expressed in a limited number of tissues and cell types, suggesting that these transcripts have physiological functions in distinct cell types and tissues. moreover, real-time rt-pcr showed extremely low levels of ghrlos in the foetal and adult liver and high levels in the hep g <dig> hepatocarcinoma cell line, suggesting that ghrlos expression may be altered in liver cancer. indeed, it has recently been reported that non-coding rna expression is frequently altered in cancer  <cit> . this indicates that non-coding rnas may have specific functions in normal cells. much like protein-coding transcripts, ncrnas may act as tumour suppressors, or be upregulated in cancer and act as oncogenes. an examination of ghrlos expression in cancer would, therefore, be of great interest.

here we have characterised the structure and organisation of ghrlos, a ghrelin antisense gene, suggesting that ghrlos has multiple first exons. therefore, it is possible that ghrlos could be a part of very large, continuous ncrna species in the 3p <dig> chromosomal region and beyond. in the absence of hallmarks, such as large open reading frames, mapping complex non-coding rna genes remains a complex task. for example, two rnas in the fmr <dig> locus, the cis-nat asfmr <dig>  <cit>  and the non-coding rna gene fmr <dig>  may be one continuous rna isoform  <cit> .

what is the function of ghrlos?
it is currently difficult and costly to determine the mechanism of function of long non-coding rnas. the roles of non-coding rnas are likely to be diverse, and there is strong evidence that they play a role in regulating important pathways. many ncrnas are expressed during development, neural differentiation, during macrophage activation and in cancer, indicating that they have key functions in these processes  <cit> . non-coding rnas have been found to play a role in the silencing of overlapping genes in cis  <cit> , in the silencing of distant chromosome regions in trans  <cit> , in nuclear trafficking  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit> , promoter repression  <cit> , and can act as tumour suppressors  <cit> . moreover, ncrnas are emerging as markers for complex human disease, including lung cancer  <cit> , heart disease  <cit> , and a range of other pathologies  <cit> . ghrlos may also serve as a host gene for snorna  genes  <cit>  or ghrlos rna transcripts may be precursors for short rnas, such as micornas  <cit> , endogenous sirnas  <cit> , pirnas  <cit>  and other novel, short non-coding rna species  <cit> .

although the understanding of natural antisense transcripts  remains in its infancy, they have been associated with a range of regulatory mechanisms that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. this includes transcriptional interference, rna masking and dsrna mediated gene-silencing via direct interaction between the sense and antisense transcripts  <cit> .

while it is difficult to predict ghrlos function, the fact that all spliced ghrlos variants share exon  <dig>  which overlaps the 3' untranslated exon  <dig> of ghrl is striking. our findings suggest that ghrlos functions as a non-coding rna. there are a few examples that suggest that antisense transcripts are important in the regulation of endocrine hormone receptors, including a thyroid hormone receptor  <cit> , and the luteinising hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor  <cit>  gene and in the regulation of growth factors  <cit> . interestingly, it has been recently suggested that the invertebrate  polypeptide hormone allatostatin may be regulated by cis-nats  <cit> . to date, however the physiological and pathophysiological roles of natural sense/antisense pairs have not been elucidated for any vertebrate endocrine hormone. further studies are necessary to reveal the function and molecular mechanisms regulating the candidate non-coding rna gene ghrlos.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we have characterised ghrlos, which gives rise to endogenous ghrelin natural antisense transcripts. ghrlos exhibits features which are common to many non-coding rna genes, including extensive splicing, lack of significant and conserved open reading frames, differential expression and lack of conservation in vertebrates. our data also reveal that ghrlos contains multiple first exons and that it overlaps both ghrl and a novel sec <dig> exon in the antisense direction, suggesting that ghrlos may have a role in regulating these genes. moreover, we report tatdn2-ghrlos chimaeras that may function to regulate the translation of the putative dnase tatdn <dig>  additional studies are underway to elucidate the functions of ghrlos and to investigate, in particular, its overlapping genomic arrangement with the ghrelin gene. these studies may provide a new, physiologically relevant model system for investigating the roles of antisense gene and non-coding rna regulation and the mechanisms involved, as well as establishing whether ghrlos rnas may be useful markers for diagnosis and prognosis of complex disease.
