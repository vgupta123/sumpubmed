BACKGROUND
erwinia amylovora is a phytopathogenic enteric bacterium that causes fire blight, a devastating disease of rosaceous species such as apples and pears. pathogen cells enter plants through the nectarthodes of flowers and other natural openings such as wounds, and are capable of rapid movement within plants and the establishment of systemic infections  <cit> . many virulence determinants of e. amylovora have been characterized, including the type iii secretion system , the exopolysaccharide  amylovoran, biofilm formation, and motility  <cit> . to successfully establish an infection, e. amylovora utilizes a complex regulatory network to sense the relevant environmental signals and coordinate the expression of early and late stage virulence factors involving two component signal transduction systems, bis--cyclic di-gmp , and quorum sensing .

one regulatory mechanism that has been utilized by many gram negative bacteria to coordinate rapid responses to environmental signals is the use of regulatory small rnas  . srnas are a group of non-coding rnas that are small in size, ranging from 50-350 nt, that target specific mrna transcripts and control the translational efficiency and mrna stability of the target mrnas. many srnas require the rna chaperone hfq for their stability and functional activation, and thus are referred to as the hfq-dependent srnas  <cit> . most of these hfq-dependent srnas are encoded in the intergenic regions of bacterial genomes, with rho-independent terminator sequences present at the 3’ end of the srnas. once transcribed, the hfq-dependent srnas are bound by hfq, which stabilizes the srnas from degradation, and facilitates the interaction of the srnas to the target mrnas  <cit> .

both computational and experimental approaches have been used in the identification of bacterial srnas. computational predictions of bacterial srnas are generally based on the sequence conservation of srnas among closely-related species, the presence of orphan promoters and terminators in the intergenic regions of the chromosome, and conserved rna secondary structure  <cit> . alternatively, many srnas have been identified by experimental methods, such as the shot-gun cloning method and tiling microarrays . recently, rna-seq has revolutionized transcriptome analysis and led to the identification of numerous srnas in many bacterial species, including in a few plant pathogenic bacteria .

bacterial srnas have been extensively studied in escherichia coli, with more than  <dig> srnas identified and some of the functions of srnas characterized . although many srnas are conserved across bacterial species, many others are species specific and require experimental characterization in individual species. for example, among a total of  <dig> srnas identified in salmonella enterica, only  <dig> of them were conserved in e. coli, and the other  <dig> are salmonella-specific srnas  <cit> . similarly,  <dig> srnas were identified in yersinia pestis, among which only  <dig> srnas were also conserved in e. coli <cit> . in pseudomonas aeruginosa,  <dig> novel srnas were identified by rna-seq, and nearly 90% of these novel srnas had no orthologs in other bacterial species  <cit> .

among all the srnas discovered in bacterial pathogens, many of them are involved in virulence regulation  <cit> . for example, in yesinia pseudotuberculosis, mice infected with the deletion mutants of two srnas  showed significantly increased survival rates and decreased weight loss in comparison to mice infected with the wild type y. pseudotuberculosis <cit> . in vibrio cholerae, qrr1- <dig>  tara, tarb, and vrra control virulence by regulating cholera toxin  biosynthesis and the toxin-co-regulated pilus , the two primary virulence factors that are responsible for colonization and subsequent disease development  <cit> . tarb and vrra directly bind to the 5’ utr and control the expression of the tcp genes  <cit>  whereas qrr1- <dig> indirectly regulate ct and tcp by controlling the quorum sensing regulators hapr, luxo, and transcriptional activator apha . in s. enterica typhimurium, four srnas contribute to bacterial pathogenesis  <cit> , including mgrr which regulates eptb, the modulator of lps modification  <cit> , invr that represses ompd, encoding the outer membrane protein synthesis protein  <cit> , and sgrs that controls ptsg and sopd, two genes involving in sugar uptake and regulation of secreted virulence factor  <cit> . in the plant pathogen xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria , deletion of the srna sx <dig> resulted in reduced virulence in infected pepper plants  <cit> . in our recent work, we observed that in e. amylovora, the deletion of the srnas arcz  and rpra significantly reduced disease symptoms in an immature pear infection model  <cit> .

in addition to the srnas, the function of hfq as a regulator of virulence traits has been demonstrated in many animal and plant pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . for example, in s. typhimurium, an hfq mutation resulted in highly attenuated invasion in epithelial cells and a significant reduction in growth in both epithelial cells and macrophages in vitro <cit> . multiple aspects of virulence were controlled by hfq, including motility, outer membrane protein production, and intracellular growth. in agrobacterium tumefaciens, the mutation of hfq led to reduced tumor formation on potato tubers, as well as delayed growth, altered morphology, and reduced motility. the uptake systems and metabolic versatility of a. tumefaciens were also tightly controlled by hfq  <cit> . in our recent work, we identified hfq as a regulator of virulence traits in e. amylovora, including the t3ss, amylovoran eps production, biofilm formation, and motility  <cit> . these observations suggest that hfq along with srnas regulated by hfq has a critical function in virulence regulation in various bacterial pathogens including e. amylovora.

although  <dig> srnas were predicted in e. amylovora by sequence conservation  <cit> , the full repertoire of srnas of e. amylovora has not been experimentally characterized. we hypothesized that we could utilize rna-seq and bioinformatic approaches to identify additional srnas in e. amylovora, and potentially identify novel srnas that regulate virulence in this plant pathogen. to acquire a better understanding of the hfq-dependent srnas in e. amylovora and their roles in virulence manipulation, we conducted a genome-wide identification of hfq-dependent srnas by combining illumina deep sequencing, bioinformatics terminator prediction, and experimental validation by 5’ race and northern blot. a total of  <dig> candidate hfq-dependent srnas were identified in the genome of e. amylovora, many of which were novel srnas and erwinia-specific srnas that were identified for the first time. in addition, four srnas, arcz, rmaa , omrab, and hrs <dig>  were identified as regulators of different virulence phenotypes during e. amylovora pathogenesis.

reads mapping and identification of srnas in the e. amylovora genome
reads that passed filtering were mapped to the e. amylovora atcc  <dig> genome  <cit>  using tophat . filtered alignments of the e. amylovora genome were used as input to cufflinks  to identify intergenic regions for which the expression was significantly reduced in ea1189Δhfq  compared to ea <dig> , respectively. statistically-significant differentially-expressed sequences from intergenic regions were obtained by applying a cutoff threshold of fdr ≤  <dig>   and an absolute log <dig> fold-change ≥  <dig> . the candidate transcript models were further manually inspected using the artemis genome browser  <cit>  to exclude regions whose transcription resulted from an extension from the adjacent orfs. the remaining transcript models were annotated as the hfq-dependent srnas. per base depth was calculated by counting the number of reads overlapping each position of the e. amylovora genome, after excluding reads which overlapped known trna and rrna loci. counts represent the aggregate for mapped reads from all replicates of each condition. depth for each condition was normalized per million reads aligned from each condition . no duplicate removal was done for this study. the raw data and processed data were uploaded to the ncbi geo database  with the accession number gse <dig> 

rho-independent terminators search
the intergenic regions of e. amylovora atcc  <dig> genome were analyzed by python script , with the purpose of identifying sequences that meet the following criteria simultaneously:  containing at least  <dig> oligo-us at the 3’ end;  containing at least 4 g + cs in the last  <dig> nucleotides immediately upstream of the oligo-us;  containing at least 50% g + cs in the last  <dig> nucleotides immediately upstream of the oligo-us. the sequences that met these criteria were further analyzed by clc main workbench version  <dig>  , for rna secondary structure. sequences that contain stem-loop structure with the free energy ∆g <  <dig>  kcal mol- <dig> were further manually checked for the upstream transcriptional activity in artemis genome browser. sequences that showed upstream transcription were documented as potential rho-independent terminators.

northern blot analysis and 5’ race assay

5’ race assays were performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> micrograms of total rna from e. amylovora ea <dig> was treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase  at 37°c for  <dig>  h.  <dig> pmol of rna oligonucleotide linker  was added to the treated rna. rna-linker mix was purified by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol  extraction and ethanol/sodium acetate precipitation method and was dissolved in 14 μl of rnase-free h2o. purified rna-linker mix was denatured at 90°c for 2 min and was ligated by t <dig> rna ligase . buffer and enzyme were removed by p-c-i extraction again and the ligated rna-linker was dissolved in 10 μl of rnase-free h2o. cdna was synthesized by superscript iii reverse transcriptase  using random hexamers following the instructions of the kit. the 5’ end of target srnas was amplified by pcr using the total cdna as the template, rna linker primer as the forward primer and primers specific for the target genes as reverse primers. the amplified pcr products were visualized on an agarose gel. bands with the largest size whose intensity was enhanced in the tobacco acid pyrophosphatase treated samples compared to the non-treated samples were excised, purified and sequenced to determine the 5’ ends of the transcripts.

nucleotide conservation analysis of e. amylovora srnas
sequences of candidate srnas obtained from the rna-seq experiment were used in a blast search against the genomes of  <dig> γ proteobacteria in the asap database . the nucleotide identity as well as the nucleotide length of the candidate srnas was obtained from the blast search. the nucleotide conservation score was calculated using the following formula: /. a hierarchical clustering from the conservation score of candidate srnas was performed using cluster  <dig>  software  <cit>  with centroid linkage. the conservation graph was generated using java treeview  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

amylovoran production, swimming motility, and hypersensitive response  assays
the amylovoran concentration in supernatants of e. amylovora cultures was quantified using a turbidity assay with cetylpyrimidinium chloride   <cit> . cells from overnight lb cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline , and inoculated into mbma medium supplemented with 1% sorbitol. the supernatant of the mbma culture was collected at 36 hrs post-inoculation following centrifugation of the culture. the amylovoran concentration in the supernatant was determined by adding 50 μl of cpc  per ml of supernatant sample, followed by measuring the optical density od <dig>  the experiments were repeated three times with four biological replicates in each experiment.

to measure bacterial swimming motility, cells were cultured on lb agar plates for 48 hr. cells were inoculated from the lb agar plates onto the center of swarming agar plates  using an inoculation needle. swimming diameters were measured at 20 hr post-inoculation. the experiments were repeated three times with four biological replicates in each experiment. for the hr assay, strains were cultured in lb broth overnight, harvested by centrifugation and washed with  <dig>  × pbs twice. cells were resuspended in  <dig>  × pbs and adjusted to a concentration of  <dig> × 107 cfu ml- <dig>  approximately 100 μl of cell suspension was infiltrated into 9 week-old nicotiana benthamiana leaves using a needle-less syringe. the hr was observed at 16 hrs after infiltration.

biofilm quantification and analysis using scanning electron microscopy
to quantify the amount of biofilm formation using crystal violet staining, bacterial strains were cultured in  <dig> x lb broth at 28°c in a 24-well plate with a glass cover slip placed in each well at a 30° angle. after 48 hr incubation, the bacterial culture was removed from the wells and 10% crystal violet was added into the wells. after incubation at 28°c for 1 hr, the glass cover slips were rinsed with water, air dried for 4 hours, and eluted with 200 μl of elution solution . the solubilized crystal violet in the elusion solution was quantified by measuring the od <dig> absorbance using a safire microplate reader . the experiment was repeated three times with  <dig> replicates in each experiment.

the observation of biofilm formation using scanning electron microscopy  was performed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, strains were cultured in  <dig> x lb broth in a  <dig> well plate with a 300 mesh tem gold grid in each well . after incubation at 28°c for 48 hr, 100 μl of paraformaldehyde-gluteraldehyde  was added to each well. the mixture was incubated at 25°c for 1 hr, and grids were dehydrated successively in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 90% ethanol for 30 min each and in 100% ethanol three times for 15 min. grids were then critical point dried using a critical point drier  and mounted on aluminum mounting stubs . samples were then coated with osmium using a pure osmium coater . images were taken on a jeol 6400 v scanning electron microscope  equipped with an lab <dig> emitter  using analysis software .

RESULTS
identification of hfq-dependent srnas by rna-seq
to identify hfq-dependent srnas, illumina deep sequencing  was performed to identify small intergenic rna transcripts whose expression was reduced in the absence of hfq. wild type e. amylovora ea <dig> and the deletion mutant ea1189Δhfq were cultured for  <dig> and 12 hr in hrp-inducing minimal medium, conditions that induce the expression of t3ss and other virulence genes  <cit> . total bacterial rna was isolated from ea <dig> 6 hr, ea <dig> 12 hr, ea1189Δhfq 6 hr and ea1189Δhfq 12 hr. small rnas ranging from  <dig> - 350 nt were enriched from the total rnas and sequenced by the illumina hiseq  <dig> system. a total of  <dig> million 50-nt paired reads were obtained. of these reads, a total of  <dig> million reads passed quality control and were used for mapping to the genome of e. amylovora atcc  <dig>  and  <dig> million reads were successfully mapped. from these,  <dig> million were excluded as alignments showed that they mapped to already annotated rrna or trna genes. the remaining reads  were used for the identification of srnas in the intergenic regions in the genome of e. amylovora.

we searched for small transcripts that aligned to intergenic regions of the e. amylovora genome, with significantly reduced expression in ea1189Δhfq 6 hr and ea1189Δhfq 12 hr compared to ea <dig> 6 hr and ea <dig> 12 hr, respectively. the candidate intergenic transcripts were further inspected manually to exclude transcripts that were extensions from the adjacent orfs. transcripts that contain orfs, riboswitches, and transcriptional regulatory structures such as jumpstart structures and phe leaders were also excluded. the remaining intergenic transcripts were annotated as candidate hfq-dependent srnas. a total of  <dig> candidate hfq-dependent srnas were identified . these srnas ranged from  <dig> to 244 nt with a median size of 110 nt and average size of 118 nt .table  <dig>

among all  <dig> putative srnas,  <dig> srnas  were identified in e. amylovora from a previous computational search based on sequence homology with known e. coli srnas  <cit> . we designated the other  <dig> srnas identified from this study as hrs  rnas. to determine if any of these srnas were novel srnas, sequences of the  <dig> srnas were compared against the rfam database  <cit> . orthologs of four e. amylovora srnas from this study  were identified in the rfam database . of note, the sequences of ryhb , identified previously, and hrs <dig>  were aligned and shown to be 73% identical . the remaining  <dig> srnas are novel srnas identified for the first time. rho-independent terminator sequences were also searched at the 3’ end of the srnas, and  <dig> of the  <dig> srnas contained typical rho-independent terminator sequences with gc-rich stem-loop structure and oligo-us whereas the remaining  <dig> srnas did not contain typical rho-independent terminators.

the abundance of srnas in the pools from ea <dig> 6 hr, ea <dig> 12 hr, ea1189Δhfq 6 hr and ea1189Δhfq 12 hr was quantified based on the reads of deep sequencing using artemis . all srnas identified showed significant reductions in abundance in ea1189Δhfq compared with ea <dig> at both 6 hr and 12 hr . to validate the accuracy of the rna abundance determined by rna-seq, the rna amount of gcvb in ea <dig> 6 hr, ea <dig> 12 hr, ea1189Δhfq 6 hr, and ea1189Δhfq 12 hr was measured by northern blot analysis . consistent with the rna-seq result, gcvb was only detected in ea <dig> but not in ea1189Δhfq at both 6 hr and 12 hr after induction . in addition, a  <dig> -fold increase of gcvb rna was detected in ea <dig> 12 hr compared to its amount at 6 hr , which is similar to an  <dig> -fold induction  detected by rna-seq. these results indicate that the quantification of srnas by illumina deep sequencing in this experiment is accurate and reliable.table  <dig>

identification of hfq-dependent srnas by rho-independent terminator search
rho-independent terminators are often considered as landmarks for the computational identification of hfq-dependent srnas in bacterial genomes  <cit> . we performed an independent search for hfq-dependent srnas by first mapping all the rho-independent terminators located within intergenic regions, and then identifying srnas by detecting short-length transcriptional activity upstream of any of these terminators. to map the rho-independent terminators, first, we compared sequences of the last  <dig> nucleotides  of eight confirmed srnas in e.amylovora . sequence alignment did not reveal any sequence conservation of the rho-independent terminators of the eight srnas . however, some common characteristics were observed among all the terminator sequences: containing at least  <dig> oligo-us at the 3’ end; containing at least 4 g + cs in the last  <dig> nucleotides immediately upstream of the oligo-us; containing at least 50% g + cs in the last  <dig> nucleotides immediately upstream of the oligo-us; and containing stem-loop rna secondary structures in the gc-rich sequences upstream of oligo-us.

with these characteristics, we performed a genome-wide search for putative rho-independent terminators in the genome of e. amylovora atcc  <dig>  using bioinformatics approaches,  <dig> putative rho-independent terminators were identified . next, we examined if transcriptional activity was present upstream of these rho-independent terminators using the rna-seq data. the majority  of these putative terminators showed transcriptional activity immediately upstream which stopped at the terminator sequences, suggesting that these sequences are actual rho-independent terminators . a total of  <dig> rho-independent terminators identified in this search showed transcriptional activity within 300 nt immediately upstream of the terminators in the intergenic regions, with reduced abundance in ea1189Δhfq 6 hr and 12 hr compared to ea <dig> 6 hr and 12 hr . these  <dig> transcripts were selected as potential hfq-dependent srnas.

we compared the  <dig> srnas identified in this search with the  <dig> srnas identified from the rna-seq experiment. our results showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> hfq-dependent srnas identified in the terminator search were also identified in the deep sequencing search. two srnas  were not identified in the rna-seq search, because of low rna abundance. these results suggest that the bioinformatics prediction of rho-independent terminators is a good complementary guideline for the identification of hfq-dependent srnas. the fact that most srnas identified in the rho-independent terminator search were also identified in the deep sequencing search also indicates that the identification of srnas by deep sequencing is accurate. in combination with rna-seq and rho-independent terminator searches, a total number of  <dig> candidate srnas  were identified .

validation of the expression and sizes of srnas by northern blot
to validate the expression and confirm the size of the srnas identified by rna-seq,  <dig> novel srnas, including  <dig> srnas with and  <dig> srnas without rho-independent terminators, were analyzed by northern blot. the expression of  <dig> srnas was detected , and one srna, hrs <dig>  was not detected . in addition, consistent with deep sequencing observations, significantly-reduced expression of most srnas was observed in ea1189Δhfq compared with ea <dig> . our results also showed that the sizes of srnas determined by northern blot are approximately the same as those determined by rna-seq, with one exception being the srna hrs <dig>  whose major transcript detected by northern blot is smaller than the size determined by rna-seq .figure  <dig>

at  <dig> and 12 hrs post-inoculation in hrp-inducing minimal medium. 5s rrna was used as the loading control. a biotin-labeled rna marker was used to estimate the sizes of the srnas. srna hrs <dig>  hrs <dig>  hrs <dig>  hrs <dig>  hrs <dig>  hrs <dig>  hrs <dig>  hrs <dig> have only one major band whereas srna hrs <dig>  hrs <dig>  hrs <dig>  and hrs <dig> have two major bands.



validation of the transcriptional start sites of srnas by 5’race
next, we performed a 5’ race assay to validate the transcriptional start sites of  <dig> srna-encoding genes determined by rna-seq, and the transcriptional start sites of  <dig> srnas were successfully mapped . of these,  <dig> srnas  only showed one major transcriptional start site whereas two srnas  showed two transcriptional start sites . similar transcriptional start sites  of hrs <dig>  hrs <dig>  hrs <dig> and hrs <dig> were determined by 5’ race assay compared to the ones determined by deep sequencing assay. the transcriptional start sites of other srnas  determined by 5’ race were 20-80 nt upstream of the sites determined by rna-seq.

sequence conservation of the hfq-dependent srnas
to determine the sequence conservation of the hfq-dependent srnas identified in e. amylovora,  <dig> bacterial genomes from four families of gamma proteobacteria, including  <dig> enterobacteriaceae species, three pseudomonadaceae species, one vibrionaceae species and one rhizobiaceae species, were searched for orthologs of the srnas identified in this study. the nucleotide conservation scores were calculated by blast search, clustered, and depicted by java tree view. based on the sequence conservation, the  <dig> srnas identified in e. amylovora could be clustered into three groups . group  <dig>  including  <dig> srnas , is conserved among most enterobacteriaceae species examined. among them,  <dig> srnas , were conserved in all enterobacteriaceae. group  <dig>  including  <dig> srnas , is conserved in the erwinia genus, but not in other enterobacteriaceae species. all  <dig> srnas in group  <dig> are conserved in e. amylovora and the related plant pathogen e. pyrifoliae, and  <dig> of them are conserved in e. amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, and another related pathogen erwinia sp. ejp <dig>  <cit>  . eleven and three group  <dig> srnas are also conserved in the non-pathogenic plant epiphytes e. tasmaniensis and e. billingiae, respectively. group  <dig>  including the other  <dig> srnas, is mostly only conserved in e. amylovora .figure  <dig>

srna expression profile at  <dig> and 12 hour of induction in hrp-inducing minimal medium
next, we determined how the expression of srnas changed following incubation of test strains in hrp-inducing minimal medium, a medium that mimics the plant environment and induces the expression of t3ss and other virulence genes  <cit> . a srna distribution graph was generated by calculating and displaying the percentage of reads of each individual srna against the total reads of all srnas in ea <dig>  at  <dig> and 12 hours post-inoculation . total srna reads increased from  <dig> at 6 hr to  <dig> at 12 hr. the most abundant srna at both time points was hrs <dig> , and the least abundant srna is hrs <dig> . the  <dig> most abundant srnas comprised more than 80% of the total srnas. comparing to the early induction at 6 hrs, the proportion of each srna in the total srnas at late stage of induction at 12 hrs also changed. among the most abundant  <dig> srnas,  <dig> srnas  showed increased expression . the other  <dig> srnas  showed decreased expression .figure  <dig>

virulence of  <dig> srna mutants
in our previous report, deletion of the hfq gene led to significantly reduced virulence in e. amylovora <cit> . to test if any hfq-dependent srnas contribute to the virulence regulation, we constructed deletion mutants of  <dig> small rnas identified in this study . the virulence of the srna mutants was compared with ea <dig> using an immature pear fruit assay. two mutants, ea1189Δt3ss and ea1189Δarcz, a srna mutant that showed significantly reduced virulence in our previous study  <cit> , were also included as controls. at 6 days post-inoculation, necrosis and oozing were observed on pears inoculated with the wild type ea <dig>  whereas no disease symptoms and reduced disease symptoms were observed on pears inoculated with ea1189Δt3ss and ea1189Δarcz, respectively. compared to the wild type ea <dig>  most srna mutants did not show any significant difference in virulence . however, the virulence of one srna mutant, ea1189Δhrs <dig>  was significantly attenuated compared with ea <dig> figure  <dig>

arcz controls bacterial attachment and biofilm formation
in our previous report, we demonstrated that hfq controls attachment and biofilm formation in e. amylovora <cit> . to identify srnas that control biofilm formation, the biofilm formation of the srna mutants was determined using a crystal violet staining assay. similar to ea1189Δhfq, ea1189Δarcz formed an increased amount of biofilm on glass cover slips compared to ea <dig> after 48 hr of incubation . when examined using electron microscopy, mature biofilm formation was observed in ea <dig> . however, the majority of cells of ea1189Δarcz and ea1189Δhfq observed were solitary, non-aggregated cells attaching to the grid surface . fewer cell aggregates with less complex structures were observed in ea1189Δarcz and ea1189Δhfq compared to ea <dig> . this suggests that similar to hfq, arcz also promotes aggregation while repressing attachment.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we identified  <dig> candidate hfq-dependent srnas in the plant pathogen e. amylovora and further demonstrated that four of them regulated various virulence traits including motility, amylovoran eps production, biofilm formation, and the t3ss. although srnas have been increasingly recognized as pivotal regulators in bacteria, genome-wide identification of srnas has only been performed in a limited number of bacteria. in plant pathogens in particular, srna identification using deep sequencing methods has been reported in only three bacterial species prior to this study. in a transcriptome analysis of pseudomonas syringae, transcription of  <dig> of the  <dig> non-coding rnas predicted by rfam database was detected  <cit> , and three previously unannotated non-coding rnas  were also discovered. in xanthomonas campestris,  <dig> srnas were identified from a genome-wide transcriptome analysis by deep sequencing, and one srna, sx <dig>  was identified as a virulence regulator  <cit> . in agrobacterium tumefaciens,  <dig> srnas were identified by combining a comparative bioinformatics approach and a deep sequencing approach  <cit> . compared to these studies which identified trans- and cis-encoded srnas, our work specifically focused on the identification of the trans- encoded srnas that are regulated by the rna chaperone hfq. the number of srnas identified in this study,  <dig>  is comparable to the number of srnas identified in the bacterial species mentioned above and in closely related species such as e.coli .

hfq-dependent srnas are a major group of bacterial srnas whose stability and function are dependent on the rna chaperone hfq. the deletion mutant of hfq in e. amylovora renders pleiotropic phenotypes including reduced motility and amylovoran production, increased attachment, disrupted t <dig> secretion and translocation, and reduced virulence  <cit> . this suggests that hfq, as the global srna chaperone, may interact with multiple srnas that target various mrnas to control different aspects of cellular and virulence processes. to test this hypothesis, we aimed to specifically identify the hfq-dependent srnas and focus on their expression in hrp-inducing minimal medium, a condition that mimics the in planta environment.

two independent searches, based on rna-seq and rho-independent terminator prediction, were performed for the purpose of identifying hfq-dependent srnas. rna-seq identifies small, intergenic transcripts whose stabilities are dependent on hfq. although some srnas identified in the deep sequencing contain rho-independent terminators, it was not clear whether the rna-seq method had identified all srnas that possess rho-independent terminators. to take the presence of rho-independent terminator into consideration and to ensure that all the srnas with rho-independent terminators are identified, we performed a second search by first mapping all of the rho-independent terminators in the e. amylovora genome, and then identifying srna-encoding genes by detecting short-length transcriptional activity upstream of the terminators. the combination of the two searches identified hfq-dependent srnas that possess rho-independent terminators and srnas that do not contain rho-independent terminators but depend on hfq for their cellular stability.

rho-independent terminators, which contain potential hfq binding sequences, are considered to be important features of hfq-dependent srnas  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> of the srnas identified did not possess typical rho-independent terminators although the abundance of these srnas was reduced in ea1189Δhfq compared to ea <dig>  prior to this work, srnas whose stabilities are dependent on the presence of hfq but do not contain rho-independent terminators have been observed in a few bacterial species. for example,  <dig> srnas were identified by rna-seq in a study aiming to identify novel srnas in e. coli <cit> . the abundance of five of them  showed significant reduction in an hfq mutant compared to the wild type e. coli. however, none of these five hfq-dependent srnas possessed rho-independent terminators  <cit> . in contrast, rho-independent terminator sequences were identified in srnas whose stability is not dependent on hfq, such as ygfl-ygge; and ynfm-asr. similarly, in yersinia pseudotuberculosis, some srnas whose abundance is hfq dependent did not contain rho-independent terminators, such as ysr <dig>  <cit> . our observation, along with previous observations, suggests the presence of srnas whose abundance is hfq-dependent yet do not contain typical rho-independent terminators in multiple species of the enterobacteriaceae family. further protein-rna binding assays will elucidate whether hfq directly interacts with these srnas or if the stabilization of the srnas by hfq is indirect.

we observed a dynamic re-patterning of hfq-dependent srnas between  <dig> and 12 hr induction in hrp-inducing mm. in e. amylovora, the expression of key virulence genes is induced in hrp-inducing minimal medium, and expression levels of some of these genes are at different levels between  <dig> and 12 hrs after inoculation. the change of proportion of an srna over time in this medium may indicate its role in modulation of virulence factors. three of the srnas whose expression increased , are also virulence-regulating srnas. by increasing their expression in the hrp-inducing medium, they may activate virulence-related genes at different timings or host locations during pathogenesis. in contrast, the relative abundance of hrs <dig> and omrab dropped from  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total srna pool at 6 hr post-induction to  <dig> % and  <dig> % at 12 hr post-induction, respectively. we also demonstrated that hrs <dig> and omrab promote motility and limit amylovoran production . in e. amylovora, motility and amylovoran are two critical virulence determinants that are expressed at different stages of infection. motility is believed to be critical for the early stage of infection, which enables e. amylovora to move from the stigma of the flower or at wound sites on leaves into the plants to establish infections. biofilm formation is turned on at the later stage of infection to help e. amylovora to migrate into the xylem and cause systemic infections, and amylovoran is a critical component of biofilms formed by e. amylovora <cit> . the fact that hrs <dig> and omrab activate motility and repress amylovoran production, and that the abundance of hrs <dig> and omrab dropped from 6 hr to 12 hr post-induction in hrp-inducing minimal medium, suggest that e. amylovora may use srnas such as hrs <dig> and omrab as a regulatory mechanism to transit from early to late stages of infection.

besides the virulence-regulating srnas, the re-patterning of the expression of other srnas was also observed. the expression of gcvb increased the most from 6 hr to 12 hr  among all srnas. a similar observation was made in e. coli, where gcvb was barely detectable at 3 hrs in m <dig> minimal medium, but was strongly expressed at 8 hrs induction when analyzed by northern blot  <cit> . likewise, the expression dynamics of hrs <dig> in e. amylovora were similar to the expression of the ortholog rybb in e. coli <cit> . taken together, these observations suggest that the expression of conserved srnas in enterobacteriaceae is similar across bacterial species, suggesting that some of the functions that these srnas possess are conserved among different species. the re-patterning of srna expression may also decide the regulatory activities of the srnas, since competitions of srnas for the availability of hfq occurs, and more abundant srnas may have better access of hfq and exert stronger regulation  <cit> .

from this study and a previous study, we have identified four srnas  as virulence regulators in e. amylovora, and in some cases have identified the specific virulence determinants regulated. omrab, arcz and hrs <dig> were identified as positive regulators of motility in this study. in contrast, omrab and arcz were shown to be negative regulators of motility and flhdc, the master regulator of motility, in e. coli <cit> . the over-expression of omrab and arcz led to reduced motility on soft agar plates, as well as reduced translation of flhdc <cit> . this suggests that although omrab and arcz are motility regulators in both e. amylovora and e. coli, the regulatory mechanism may be different.

hrs <dig> is a novel hfq-dependent srna that was identified for the first time, and we demonstrated that hrs <dig> inversely controls amylovoran production and motility in e. amylovora. although not documented in the rfam database, hrs <dig> has high sequence conservation in many enterobacteriaceae species . since hrs <dig> has not been previously characterized in other enterobacteriaceae and in light of the functions identified in this study, here we name it rmaa . the sequence and function of rmaa was documented in ncbi, with the accession number kj <dig>  it would be interesting to further characterize the detailed regulatory mechanism of rmaa on motility and amylovoran production in e. amylovora, as well as the regulatory function of rmaa in other enterobacteriaceae species.

arcz was identified as a virulence-regulating srna in our previous study  <cit> , and we found in this study that arcz confers pleiotropic regulation on multiple virulence determinants including motility, amylovoran production, attachment, biofilm formation, and the type iii secretion system. our observations that the virulence regulation repertoire of arcz is very similar to that of the global srna chaperone hfq suggests that arcz could be the most critical virulence regulating srna in e. amylovora. arcz was previously described as a positive regulator of the stationary sigma factor rpos and a negative regulator of motility in e. coli <cit> . it is also known as a negative regulator of serine uptake, oxidative stress, and motility in salmonella <cit> . additionally, arcz is characterized as one of the  <dig> srnas that are not required for murine virulence in salmonella enterica <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first report describing the regulatory mechanism of arcz affecting virulence. this also suggests that a small rna may play different regulatory roles in various pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we used an experimental method and a computational method and successfully identified candidate hfq-dependent srnas in the genome of e. amylovora. these results provide basis for the future characterization of the functions, evolution and conservation of these srnas in e. amylovora. in addition, multiple hfq-dependent srnas were demonstrated to control various virulence functions. this observation, together with our previous finding that the rna chaperone hfq controls multiple virulence factors  <cit> , suggests that the post-transcriptional regulation by hfq and hfq-dependent srnas may play an important role in virulence modulation in e. amylovora. we also characterized the motility and amylovoran regulation by a novel srna hrs <dig> , which is conserved in multiple enterobacteriaceae species but not documented, for the first time. finally, we demonstrated that arcz, which has a pleiotropic regulation of all major virulence factors characterized in e. amylovora so far, might be the most critical virulence-regulating srna in this pathogen.
