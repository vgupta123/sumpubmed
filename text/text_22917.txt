BACKGROUND
micrornas  are an extensive class of small  regulatory rnas found in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms and viruses  <cit> . increasing evidence shows that mirnas function in several biological processes, including development, cellular differentiation, proliferation, metabolism and apoptosis  <cit> . single mirnas may regulate hundreds of different target genes at the post-transcriptional level, and extensively control more than 30% of animal genes  <cit> . plant mirnas regulate the expression of other genes by cleaving perfect or nearly perfect complementary sites within the transcribed regions  <cit> , whereas animal mirnas repress the translational expression of genes by partially binding to the complementary target sites at 3'untranslated regions   <cit> . the first members of the mirna family discovered in invertebrates, lin- <dig> and let- <dig>  are expressed in caenorhabditis elegans at distinct stages of development and regulate the timing of larval transition through cell-fate decisions  <cit> . in insects, bantam mirna regulates cell proliferation and death by targeting the apoptosis gene hid   <cit> . drosophila mir- <dig> is implicated in fat metabolism, stress resistance and cell death  <cit> . interestingly, most of these well-characterized mirnas are highly conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates, resulting in maintenance of their regulatory functions across species  <cit> .

the tissue-specific expression patterns of mirnas observed in many species  <cit>  are considered a prerequisite for specifying and maintaining tissue identity  <cit> . moreover, tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns are directly associated with the physiological functions of mirnas. for instance, mir- <dig> is specifically expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle precursor cells, and regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation in vertebrates  <cit> . in drosophila, mirna- <dig> is strongly expressed throughout the mesoderm of early embryos and subsequently in somatic, visceral, and pharyngeal muscles and the dorsal vessel, and functions in the post-mitotic growth of larval muscle  <cit> . mir- <dig> is an abundant liver-specific mirna  <cit> , which facilitates replication of the hepatitis c viral rna in humans  <cit>  and regulates cholesterol and fatty-acid metabolism  <cit> . establishment of the tissue-specific distribution of mirnas in these species offers critical insights into the roles of corresponding mirnas in tissue specification and cell lineage decisions.

b. mori, a characteristic representative of lepidoptera, has long been used as a model for lepidopteran biology  <cit> . a number of silkworm mirnas have been experimentally identified and temporally characterized  <cit> . however, only the spatial expression patterns of let- <dig> have been extensively characterized in the silkworm to date  <cit> . in this study, we established the distribution of silkworm mirnas in fifth-instar day  <dig> larvae and their spatiotemporal expression patterns in the body wall, silk glands, midgut and fat body during metamorphosis.

RESULTS
identification of mirnas in multiple tissues of fifth-instar day  <dig> larvae
to determine the global spatial expression patterns of mirnas in silkworm, we designed a dna oligonucleotide-based microarray examining  <dig> unique mirnas with  <dig> antisense probes  <cit> . to verify results, all probes for mirnas and controls were printed in triplicate on two parallel blocks. the microarray raw data and processed files have been deposited in the ncbi gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse <dig>  to make the inter-slide signals comparable, all net signals of fifth-instar day  <dig> larvae were normalized on the basis of u <dig> and  <dig> s rrna signals. all internal and external controls were deleted after normalization. in all, only  <dig> mirnas , including bmo-let- <dig>  bmo-mir-34b and bmo-bantam, were ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, whereas individual tissues were enriched for distinct sets of mirnas . for example, strong expression signals of mir- <dig>  and mir-263b  were specifically detected in the head. similarly, mir- <dig> is restricted to the central nervous system of the fruit fly  <cit>  and only expressed in the brain of mouse  <cit> . the drosophila orthologue of bmo-mir- <dig> has been identified in the nervous system, and may be related to segmentation, sensory organ development, and notch signal transduction  <cit> . in the silkworm, mir- <dig>  was expressed in the head and gonads in both sexes, as well as in the body wall in males. three mirnas, mir- <dig> , mir- <dig>  and mir-13a  were solely detected in the head, body wall and malpighian tubules. a previous study shows that mir- <dig> is expressed predominantly in a single anterior stripe in drosophila blastoderm embryos roughly corresponding to the intercalary segment  <cit> . in the silkworm, mir- <dig>  expression was restricted to the silk glands and malpighian tubules. mir- <dig>  was most strongly detected in the head and body wall, followed by the midgut, fat body and the malpighian tubules, but was undetectable in the silk glands, gonads and hemocytes. mir- <dig>  and mir-307-5p  were expressed in the head, body wall, fat body, ovaries, hemocytes and malpighian tubules.

all expressed mirnas confirmed by microarray and northern blotting methods are summarized in this table. a normalized signal value â‰¥ <dig>  was regarded as the positive expression threshold. nevertheless, only those having signals higher than  <dig>  in at least four specimens are listed here as the confirmed members. the same tissues from females and males are unified here. the alpha-numeric order in the left most column is listed sequentially for easier comparison of the results in this file with the descriptions in the text. abbreviations: +, expressed; -, not expressed; no. the alpha-numeric number; hd, head; bw, body wall; asg, anterior silk gland; psg, posterior silk gland; mg, midgut; fb, fat body; ov, ovary; te, testis; hc, hemocyte; mt, malpighian tubule; nor, northern blotting; na, not assayed.

hierarchical clustering based on expression variations revealed a clear split between different tissues and organs . the anterior and posterior silk glands were tightly clustered, but clearly distinct from other tissue subsets, indicating no evident expression differences between the two distal segments of the silk gland. fat body, gonads and hemocytes from both sexes were closely linked, but clearly separate from each other in clustering. the same tissues and organs from both sexes were obviously clustered into one subgroup, indicating that roles of individual mirnas could be elucidated by linking to the biology of tissues in which they were uniquely expressed. northern-blot results confirmed the significant diversity of the spatial expression profiles . for instance, both methods confirmed exclusive expression of mir-281-5p and mir-281-3p in the anterior-posterior silk glands, midgut and malpighian tubules of both females and males. this tissue-specific distribution indicates that mirnas are unlikely to be transported among different tissues, although dna may travel from the silk glands to the fat body  <cit> .

the silk glands of b. mori are completely formed at the end of embryonic development, and highly differentiated into anterior, middle and posterior sections  <cit> . the silk glands are responsible for the production of two categories of cocoon protein, fibroins and sericins. expression of all sericin genes is limited to the anterior and middle parts of the silk gland  <cit> , whereas fibroin genes are expressed exclusively in the posterior silk gland  <cit> . the repeated turn-off and turn-on of sericin and fibroin genes has been attributed to the action of ecdysone and juvenile hormone  <cit> . in this study, only  <dig> unique mirnas were detected in the silk gland, and no section-specific mirnas were identified using microarrays , but northern-blot analysis revealed significantly higher levels of bantam, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in the anterior silk gland compared with the posterior silk gland .

sex-biased expression of mirnas
we screened mirnas displaying sex-dependent expression patterns using microarray analysis . approximately  <dig> mirnas were significantly expressed in the body wall of males . additionally, northern-blot results confirmed sex differences in body wall expression of  <dig> mirnas  . even though no mirnas presented obvious section-specific status in the silk gland on the basis of microarray analysis, several mirnas showed some sex-dependent accumulation in this organ . importantly, sex-dependent expression was tissue-specific. for example, mir- <dig> was predominantly expressed in the body wall and fat body in males, and in the malpighian tubules in females. sex-dependent expression of mir- <dig> was also observed in the gonads and hemocyte on microarray blocks with two different probes. in all, microarray analyses revealed sex-specific differences in the expression patterns of  <dig> other mirnas in the gonads. specifically,  <dig> were significantly expressed in the ovaries  and four in the testes . northern blotting revealed marked individual differences in the levels of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-10b-3p/5p and mir-34b in the gonads . however, the sex-bias of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-10b-3p was in contrast with microarray results. small expression differences in mir- <dig> were observed in male and female anterior silk glands  and posterior silk glands , but differences were more significant in the malpighian tubules  . based on microarray analysis,  <dig> female-biased mirnas were detected in the malpighian tubules , whereas mir-276-5p and mir- <dig> showed male-prone accumulation in malpighian tubules. similar results were obtained by northern blot analysis for bantam, mir-2a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . mir-263b and mir- <dig> expression patterns were not significantly different between sexes in microarray analyses. in contrast, northern blotting confirmed high mir-263b expression levels in the head, midgut and fat body of males, and high mir- <dig> expression levels in the midgut of females . although we cannot exclude a technical basis for this discrepancy, the inconsistent data obtained with microarray and northern-blot analyses may have arisen from individual differences in the metabolic states of the silkworms used for sampling. this is because some sex-dependent mirnas have been shown to respond sensitively to nutritional status, which reduces the sex difference, even under mild starvation conditions  <cit> .

listed in this table are mirnas showing sex-bias in any tissue examined. the degree of sex difference is represented by the ratio of the normalized signals between females and males. abbreviations: hd, head; bw, body wall; asg, anterior silk gland; psg, posterior silk gland; mg, midgut; fb, fat body; gn, gonads; hc, hemocyte; mt, malpighian tubule.

recent studies have also shown sex-related mirna expression patterns in the rat  <cit> . for example, mir-29b is predominantly expressed in the liver of female rats  <cit> , in contrast to the sex differences observed in silkworm gonads. specific protein-coding genes of b. mori also display sexual differences  <cit> . the livers of rat and human males contain higher levels of genes involved in fuel metabolism, whereas fatty acid translocase is predominantly transcribed in females  <cit> . several sex-dependent hepatic genes in the rat liver are regulated by growth hormone   <cit> . gh significantly down regulates sex-dependent hepatic mirnas , but does not affect the levels of  <dig> s rrna  <cit> . cell-cycle genes are also activated during the initiation of midgut metamorphosis, and depend on ecdysone signaling. these results demonstrate multiple new connections between the ecdysone regulatory network and other well-characterized regulatory networks.

dynamic expression patterns in tissues during metamorphosis
to determine the extent of tissue-specific changes during specific developmental events, we assessed changes in mirna expression in four individual tissues and organs  from fifth-instar day  <dig> larvae to pupae. the microarray raw data and processed files are also accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig>  to make the inter-slide signals more comparable, all net signals of scanned points were normalized using a global-mean method. the unsupervised hierarchical clustering of mirna expression based on microarray clearly separated these four tissues , with greater differences in mirna expression between tissues than developmental stages. both methods confirmed that most mirnas were preferentially expressed in individual tissues . for example, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were mainly observed in the silk glands and midgut. alternative probes used with both methods confirmed substantial mir- <dig> expression levels in the body wall and midgut during metamorphosis, which was clearly observed in the fat body of cocoon-spinning larvae and lasted until the end of the spinning period. mir-34b was highly expressed in the four tissues of late fifth instar larvae, and exclusively induced in the silk glands at the onset of the wandering stage; this was followed by a sharp decrease in expression in the four tissues at the end of the cocoon-spinning period. in contrast to mir-34b, low levels of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were confirmed with both methods in the four tissues of fifth-instar day  <dig> larvae, but strong expression was verified in the body wall, midgut and fat body from the spinning larval to pupal stages. notably, mirna- <dig> expression was exclusively detected in the silk glands during metamorphosis. complementary to mir- <dig> expression, mir-184-3p was significantly expressed in the body wall, midgut and fat body, but was absent from the silk glands. mir- <dig> was most strongly detected in the fat body compared with other tissues during metamorphosis. the two methods also showed that mir- <dig> was almost undetectable in the body wall of fifth-instar day  <dig> larvae and in the fat body during the whole metamorphosis period, but was highly expressed in the histolytic silk glands and midgut. some other mirnas displaying tissue-prominent accumulation are included in figure  <dig> 

we were particularly interested in mirnas that are developmentally regulated within individual tissues. accordingly, we compared the expression patterns of these mirnas in each tissue during metamorphosis. the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas were significantly altered in at least one of the four tissues during the developmental transition from larvae to pupae . a small fraction of mirnas increased or decreased expression in the four tissues, indicative of common responses in shared functions. common or similar regulatory motifs and cognate transcription factors may be responsible for such co-expression. among these mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are clustered in the silkworm genome  <cit>  and were found to be coordinately upregulated. in addition, ten mirnas increased and eight mirnas decreased in at least two tissues. an extremely small set of mirnas displayed unique alterations in each particular tissue. only  <dig> mirnas showed divergent expression patterns, with increasing abundance in one tissue and decreasing abundance in another. the larval-specific tissues, silk glands and midgut, contained a larger set of downregulated mirnas during apoptosis, whereas the body wall and fat body had a larger number of upregulated mirnas during metamorphic transitions. although mir-2a and mir-13a, mir-10a and mir-10b are closely clustered in the silkworm genome  <cit> , their expression patterns were distinct. such discrepancies between the expression profiles of unique mirnas may be attributed to the existence of separate cis-regulatory controls. in general, these results provide a record of the set of mirnas that are differentially expressed during the onset of metamorphosis.

experiments with alternative probes on females and males confirmed upregulation of let- <dig> in the body wall, silk glands and fat body, but some fluctuations in the midgut; its expression changes in these tissues further support its potential roles in histolysis and histogenesis  <cit> . bantam mirna exhibited constant expression levels in the body wall, silk glands and midgut, but presented significant down-regulation in the fat body . mir- <dig> expression was restricted to the silk glands and malpighian tubules , and dramatically declined in the silk glands during metamorphosis . previous studies have shown robust mir- <dig> expression during the vigorous periods of silk gland growth and spinning  <cit> , suggesting it has a role in silk gland regulation.

during b. mori development, almost all tissues and organs undergo different stages of metamorphic transformation. in the final larval stage, tissues are pupally committed, and their developmental fate is restricted to pupal differentiation under the action of ecdysteroid secreted during the prepupal period  <cit> . the silkworm midgut and silk glands are committed to degenerate after pupal ecdysis within about  <dig> hours  <cit> . the fat body, however, survives into adulthood through simultaneous histolysis and histogenesis in each transition, particularly from larva to pupa  <cit> . death or renewal of these tissues is triggered by ecdysone  <cit>  and coordinated by the mirna pathway  <cit> . the physiological functions of mirnas in histolysis and histogenesis during silkworm metamorphosis are currently open to speculation. investigation of mirna expression in these tissues under conditions of programmed cell death or apoptosis may aid in establishing the critical molecular mechanisms underlying metamorphosis.

differential or coordinate expression of mirna arms as well as sense and antisense transicripts
in the present study, we observed that mirnas from two arms of the precursor were not always equally transcribed . for example, in the fifth-instar day  <dig> larvae, mir-307-5p was expressed at greatest levels in hemocytes, followed by the head, body wall, fat body, ovaries and malpighian tubules for both sexes, but mir-307-3p was not detected in all examined tissues. mir-iab-4-5p was widely expressed in the body wall, midgut, fat body, ovaries, testes and malpighian tubules in both sexes, but only appeared in the body wall of males. interestingly, mir-276-5p was only expressed in the malpighian tubules of females, whereas mir-276-3p was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues other than the testes. however, mir-281-5p and mir-281-3p were strongly expressed in the malpighian tubules, silk glands and midgut, and weakly expressed in the head and body wall. conversely, mir-10b-5p and mir-10b-3p displayed strong expression in the head and relatively weak expression in the body wall, midgut and malpighian tubules in both sexes, but were almost undetectable in the silk glands, fat body, gonads and hemocytes. in tissues undergoing histolysis and regeneration, mir-10b-3p/5p pair strongly expressed in the body wall and midgut, and mir-281-3p/5p pair most strongly expressed in the silk gland and midgut; here mirnas from both arms demonstrated a high degree of co-expression. nevertheless, other 5p/3p pairs showed large differences during this stage of metamorphosis . the underlying mechanism responsible for the co-expression is elusive since this coordinate accumulation occurred selectively.

we also used the sense probes of four mirnas to examine their antisense transcripts. the asymmetric expression observed for mirnas was also evident for sense and antisense mirnas . in detail, mir-276-5p was only expressed in the malpighian tubules of female fifth-instar day  <dig> larvae, but its antisense strand was detected in the body wall and malpighian tubules of both sexes. similarly, mir-263b was only expressed in the head of the two sexes but its antisense strand was detected in the body wall of males. mir-2a was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, with the strongest signals found in the head and body wall, followed by the gonads and malpighian tubules, and then the silk glands, fat body and midgut, but the antisense strand was not found in these tissues. during metamorphosis, bmo-mir-2a was highly expressed in the four tissues, but no expression signals were detected for its antisense transcript; both mir-276-5p and its antisense transcript were absent or expressed at low levels in the body wall, and fat body, but strongly accumulated in the silk gland and midgut. their expression changed in a coordinate way, but, according to microarray analysis, mir-276-5p tripled in the silk gland throughout the entire spinning stage, in comparison with anti-mir-276-5p. mir- <dig> and its antisense transcript showed a high degree of co-expression in the four tissues of fifth-instar day  <dig> larvae, but expression differences appeared in the larvae at the onset of cocoon spinning, and became greater in the following stages. sense/antisense mirnas seem to be employed in a wide range of species  <cit> . we speculate that more loci in the silkworm will be found to produce sense/antisense mirnas from the noncoding dna strand since the reverse complements of many other pre-mirna hairpins also fold into hairpins reminiscent of mirna precursors.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we describe the first spatial expression profile of mirnas in the silkworm. the diverse mirna expression patterns we observed indicate that specific aspects of spatial patterning are subject to regulation by mirnas. furthermore, we observed varying spatiotemporal patterns of mirna expression in the silkworm from the larval to pupal stages. integration of fifth instar day  <dig> larval and spatiotemporal expression data during tissue metamorphosis should aid in guiding future functional studies of these mirnas.
