BACKGROUND
the saccharomyces cerevisiae major facilitator superfamily  of transporters involved in multidrug resistance , i.e., in the simultaneous resistance to a wide range of structurally and functionally unrelated cytotoxic chemicals  <cit> , were classified in three protein families as deduced from the sequence analysis of the open reading frames identified after the release of the whole genome sequence  <cit> . two of these families are the 12-spanner drug:h+ antiporter family  <dig>  and the 14-spanner drug:h+ antiporter family  <dig>   <cit>  while the third was called the unknown major facilitator  family  <cit> . following the demonstration that four s. cerevisiae umf members encoded siderophore transporters  <cit> , these proteins were reassigned to a new protein family, denominated the arn family   <cit> . arn2p and arn4p  have high siderophore substrate specificity for the bacterial catecholate enterobactin and for triacetylfusarinine c, respectively, while arn <dig> and arn3p  show a broad and overlapping siderophore substrate specificity  <cit> . although the other two proteins of the umf family are highly similar to the arn transporters  <cit> , no experimental evidence has been obtained supporting their involvement in siderophore transport  <cit> . more recently, these two proteins were demonstrated to function as glutathione extrusion pumps  and designated gex1p and gex2p  <cit> .

the s. cerevisiae dha <dig> family comprises ten proteins encoded by atr <dig>  ymr279c, yor378w, sge <dig>  azr <dig>  vba <dig>  vba <dig>  vba <dig>  vba <dig> and vba <dig> genes  <cit> , but the physiological functions of the majority of these proteins are still unclear. atr <dig> was the first s. cerevisiae dha <dig> gene to be biochemically characterized and found to confer resistance to aminotriazole and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide   <cit> . later, a screen for yeast genes conferring resistance to boron revealed that the plasma membrane atr1p was the main exporter for this element  <cit> . the orf ymr279c was proposed to encode a back-up boron pump  <cit>  while orf yor378w is not required for boron tolerance  <cit>  but determines yeast resistance to cycloheximide and streptomycin and sensitivity to rapamycin  <cit> . vba1p, vba2p and vba3p were found to be involved in vacuolar uptake of basic amino acids, mediating the transport of histidine and lysine into the vacuole  <cit>  and vba2p was also found to catalyze the vacuolar transport of arginine  <cit> . although vba4p was localized at the vacuolar membrane  <cit> , no significant differences in the vacuolar uptake of basic amino acids were registered in a ∆vba <dig> mutant compared with the parental strain  <cit>  and the physiological function of vba4p remains unknown  <cit> . with the exception of five amino acid residues and the presence of an extra peptide of  <dig> amino acids in the n terminus, vba5p exhibits the same sequence as vba3p  <cit> . however, differently from vba3p, vba5p localizes exclusively at the plasma membrane where it catalyzes the uptake of lysine and arginine into the cell  <cit>  and vba <dig> overexpression was shown to lead to increased susceptibility of yeast cells to 4-nqo and quinidine  <cit> . the transcription level of s. cerevisiae vba <dig> gene was found to be highly induced under low-iron conditions  <cit> . the azr <dig> gene encodes a plasma membrane transporter required for yeast adaptation to low-molecular-weight organic acids, in particular to acetic acid, and to the antifungals ketoconazole and fluconazole and to polymyxin b  <cit> . the sge <dig> gene encodes a plasma membrane transporter presumably involved in the expulsion of dye molecules possessing a large unsaturated domain that stabilizes a permanent positive charge, such as 10-n-nonyl acridine orange, crystal violet, ethidium bromide and malachite green  <cit> . sge <dig> gene also confers resistance to methylmethane sulfonate  <cit>  and was reported to be present in multiple copies in the genomes of s. cerevisiae strains involved in industrial production of fuel ethanol or saké  <cit> . knq1p, a functionally characterized dha <dig> transporter of kluyveromyces lactis, was found to be involved in oxidative stress response and iron homeostasis  <cit> . this protein was found to define a new branch in a phylogenetic tree constructed using the dha <dig> proteins encoded in the genomes of  <dig> hemiascomycete yeasts  <cit> .

the evolutionary history of the dha <dig> genes present in the genome of  <dig> hemiascomycete yeast species was reconstructed by combining building tree methodologies with gene neighbourhood analysis  <cit> . gene neighbourhood analysis is a comparative genome based-approach used to infer gene lineages  <cit> . in the present study, we undertook the clustering of the amino acid sequences of a total of  <dig>  translated orfs obtained from  <dig> sequenced yeast strains from  <dig> different hemiascomycetous species to construct a homogenous protein classification system which was used to trace back the evolutionary history of genes encoding dha <dig> transporters in the hemiascomycetes. combined with tree construction methods, this approach allowed the most comprehensive phylogenetic characterization of the hemiascomycetous dha <dig> proteins available to date. the results obtained during this study also suggest that the dha <dig>  arn and gex transporters are closely related families.

methods
hemiascomycete yeast genomes
the translated orfs of the  <dig> sequenced hemiascomycetous strains analysed in this work were retrieved from the genome databases indicated in table  <dig>  these  <dig> hemiascomycetous strains correspond to  <dig> different species,  <dig> of which belong to the saccharomyces complex,  <dig> to the ctg complex and  <dig> are the early-divergent hemiascomycetes, pichia pastoris and yarrowia lipolytica. henceforth, the four letters code shown in table  <dig> for species abbreviation will be used to designate both yeast genes and species. the letter displayed after the first four letters is used to abbreviate the strain name when the genome of more than one strain from a given species is available or when the genome of the same strain was sequenced by different research centres. to uniformize the annotation used, translated orfs are always represented with small letters.

information regarding strain acronyms, the corresponding phylogenetic complex, phylogenetic position concerning the wgd event, genome coverage, estimated genome size and database from where the genome sequence was retrieved is shown.

sequence clustering of the translated orfs
the comparative genomic approach used in this study is based on the sequence clustering of all translated orfs of the  <dig> sequenced yeast strains. this required the compilation and organization of a total of  <dig>  translated orfs. these translated orfs were organized into a blast database and compared all-against-all using blastp algorithm made available in blast <dig> package  <cit> . the blastp algorithm used gapped alignment with the following parameter: expectation value , open gap , extend gap , threshold for extending hits  and word size . this approach generated a total of  <dig> million pairwise alignments. in order to handle this amount of data, sequence clustering was formulated as a graph traversal problem, where the nodes are the translated orfs and the edges indicate the existence of pairwise sequence similarity between amino acid sequences. classification of the translated orfs into clusters was achieved by breadth-first traversing this network at different e-value thresholds, ranging from e- <dig> to e- <dig> 

gene neighbourhood analysis
during this work, a mysql genome database was built compiling a series of genomic information regarding the previously mentioned translated orfs. this genomic information includes gene name, chromosome/contig, sequence clustering classification, gene start position, gene end position, amino acid sequence length and encoded amino acid sequences. the package “sqldf”  <cit>  and complementing scripting in r language was used to retrieve fifteen neighbour genes on each side of the query genes as well as the corresponding sequence clustering classification from this hemiascomycetous genome database. the rationale of synteny analysis resides on the assumption that two genes of different yeast species whose translation products belong to the same sequence cluster  will be members of the same gene lineage if they share at least one pair of neighbours that are also homologous to each other by similarity  <cit> . the process is reiterated for all possible heterospecific pairwise comparisons of homologues deduced from the sequence clusters. the sequence clustering classification of the thirty genes neighbouring each query gene was done using a conservative blastp e-value of e- <dig> to limit the number of false positive sequences incorporated together with true cluster members. when further evidences were needed to corroborate dubious synteny connections between genes, sequence clustering was performed at a less restrictive e-value threshold .

the chromosome neighbourhood of the query genes was converted into a format adequate for import into the cytoscape environment  <cit> . in the resulting networks, nodes represent query genes and edges represent pairs of neighbouring genes classified in the same sequence cluster. useful biological information indicated below was imported into the cytoscape network as edges attributes. the existence of synteny between query genes was verified through the analysis of network topology  and the biological information associated with the corresponding edges. the advantage of this framework is that it allows scrutinizing the synteny relationships established between genes in a simple mathematical context of network topology exploration. three sources of biological information were used to assess the strength of each neighbour pair connection  <cit> : i) closeness of the connecting neighbours in relation to the query genes, ii) sequence similarity between connecting neighbours and iii) dimension of the sequence cluster to which the homologous neighbours belong; small dimension of the sequence cluster indicates that it is small the probability that two homologous neighbours are in the vicinity of two query genes by chance.

topology prediction, sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree building
the topology of the amino acid sequences was analysed using hmmtop and tmhmm  <dig>  bioinformatics tools  <cit> . for each amino acid sequence not showing  <dig> tms and with less than  <dig> residues in length, the tms range was predicted by visual analysis of the topology probability and protein hydrophobicity plots generated by tmhmm  <dig>  and toppred  <dig>  <cit> , respectively.

multiple alignments of the amino acid sequences were calculated by muscle  <cit>  and processed using the phylip package  <cit> . protdist/neighbour and proml packages were used to generate the phylogenetic trees based on distance and maximum likelihood methods, respectively. the dendroscope application was used for tree visualization  <cit> .

sequence identity and similarity shared between protein pairs was assessed using an all-against-all needleman-wunsch alignment approach. this algorithm was run using the needle package available in the emboss suite  <cit> . all needle pairwise alignments made in this work used default values for the gap open and gap extension parameters,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. after the construction of the dha <dig> phylogenetic tree, all-against-all needleman-wunsch alignments were also constructed for the members of each phylogenetic cluster.

RESULTS
identification of the dha <dig> proteins in  <dig> hemiascomycetous strains
the constraining and traversing of a pairwise similarity network allowed the identification of the dha <dig> proteins encoded in the genomes of  <dig> hemiascomycetous strains. the functionally characterized atr <dig> protein was used as starting node for the network traversal. analysis of the plot representing the number of sequences retrieved at different e-values shows the existence of four distinct blastp clustering ranges. the first range occurs between e-values e- <dig> to e- <dig>  gathering  <dig> amino acid sequences highly similar to the starting node atr1p , including s. cerevisiae orfs ymr279c and yor378w . in the second blastp clustering range  occurs the merge of the amino acid sequences comprised in groups  <dig> and  <dig>  with those of group  <dig> , originating a total of  <dig> sequences. group  <dig> comprises the s. cerevisiae dha <dig> transporters sge <dig>  azr <dig>  vba <dig>  vba <dig>  vba <dig>  vba <dig> and vba <dig>  group  <dig> comprises the amino acid sequences of s. cerevisiae arn and gex 14-spanner mfs transporters. members of clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are linked by many connections, indicating the existence of strong homology between amino acid segments of these transporters. in the third blastp clustering range , group  <dig>  comprising the biochemically characterized dha <dig> transporter of k. lactis species, knq1p, is merged with groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the resulting supergroup contains a total of  <dig> amino acid sequences. analysis of the number of tms shown by these amino acid sequences  together with the construction of a phylogenetic tree  confirmed that all true 14-spanner transporters were gathered at this blastp clustering range. in the fourth blastp clustering range , false positive amino acid sequences are incorporated with the true 14-spanner mfs proteins.

the joint retrieval of the dha <dig>  arn and gex proteins by this in silico approach suggests the existence of a close phylogenetic relationship linking these transporters. consistent with this indication, the dha <dig>  arn and gex proteins encoded in the genome of s. cerevisiae s288c strain were clustered in a single protein family, cl3c <dig>  by the génolevures consortium  <cit> . these results were confirmed by breadth-first traversing this network using the functionally characterized sge <dig>  vba <dig>  vba <dig>  arn <dig>  arn <dig>  arn <dig>  gex <dig> and knq <dig> proteins as starting nodes. for the sake of clarity, only the results of atr1p, knq1p, sge1p and arn1p are shown in figure 1a since the remaining amino acid sequences clustered with one of these four proteins .

phylogenetic analysis of the hemiascomycetous dha <dig>  arn and gex transporters
the analysis of the hydrophobicity and topology of the 14-spanner proteins gathered in the third blastp clustering range revealed that  <dig> of these comprised full-size transporters while  <dig> were fragments . a phylogenetic tree representing the full-size dha <dig>  arn and gex proteins was built and divided into  <dig> clusters, labelled from a to t . since the distance and the maximum likelihood methods originated similar phylogenetic trees regarding cluster composition , only the tree obtained using the distance method is shown . the stability of cluster composition of the phylogenetic trees obtained by the distance and maximum likelihood methods supported the division of the phylogenetic tree into the  <dig> clusters. to avoid tree artefacts resulting from root positioning, the pist_igi <dig> protein was manually chosen as root for the phylogenetic tree  since this protein does not cluster together with any of the other amino acid sequences. the neddle package of emboss suite was used to make all possible pairwise alignment combinations between the full-size 14-spanner mfs-mdr proteins. pairwise sequence comparisons revealed that the sequence identity of transporters residing in the same phylogenetic cluster ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % whereas sequence similarity ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

using as reference the dha <dig>  arn and gex transporters encoded in the s. cerevisiae s288c genome, this phylogenetic tree  was used to assign sequence homology to the 14-spanner transporters encoded in the genomes of the remaining hemiascomycetous strains . for example, regarding the siderophore transporters arsenal present in the genome of the ten candida pathogenic species considered in this study, the analysis of table  <dig> shows that c. albicans and c. dubliniensis only possess caarn <dig> type of siderophore transporters , c. tropicalis and c. parapsilosis exhibit both caarn <dig> and arn <dig> types of siderophore transporters  and c. glabrata, an opportunistic yeast pathogen belonging to the saccharomyces complex, only exhibits one siderophore transporter . eight translated orfs in the genome of c. albicans sc <dig> were iden-tified as bona fide dha <dig> transporters: caal_a_ <dig> , caal_a_ <dig> , caal_a_ <dig> , caal_a_ <dig> , caal_a_ <dig> , caal_a_ <dig> , caal_a_ <dig>  and caal_a_ <dig> . an additional orf, orf <dig> , was proposed before as encoding a dha <dig> protein  <cit>  but the corresponding amino acid sequence shares high similarity with s. cerevisiae orf ymr155w, a putative protein of unknown function, identified as interacting with hsp82p  <cit> . consistent with our proposal, the protein classification system developed by the génolevures consortium also clustered ymr155w amino acid sequence in the gl3c <dig> family while the s. cerevisiae dha <dig> proteins are grouped in the gl3r <dig> family. no association could be found between the presence of particular genes encoding dha <dig>  arn and gex transporters in the yeast genomes examined and the corresponding species pathogenicity .

information regarding total number of full size transporters and their average percentage of sequence identity and similarity is shown.

the family functional classification of each s. cerevisiae 14-spanner mfs transporter was retrieved from the transporter classification database   <cit>  and the information was added to figure  <dig>  the tcdb classification divides the genes that have been considered as encoding the s. cerevisiae dha <dig> transporters into two families. “the drug:h+ antiporter- <dig>   family” , comprising atr <dig>  sge <dig>  azr <dig> and vba <dig> genes and orf yor378w, and “the vacuolar basic amino acid transporter  family” , comprising vba <dig>  vba <dig> and vba <dig> genes. the vba <dig> gene and the orf ymr279c, historically considered as members of the dha <dig> protein family  <cit> , do not have family classification in tcdb database. the proteins encoded by arn <dig>  arn <dig>  arn <dig> and arn <dig> genes reside in a single tcdb family, “the siderophore-iron transporter  family” . the gex <dig> and gex <dig> encoded transporters are also not included in tcdb database.

identification of dha <dig>  arn and gex gene lineages in the hemiascomycetes
gene neighbourhood analysis of the chromosome environment where the dha <dig>  arn and gex genes reside allowed the identification of thirteen gene lineages . this analysis involved the representation of synteny between genes in a network framework and, subsequently, the exploitation of the network topology in cytoscape software environment. dha <dig> genes encoding transporters present in phylogenetic clusters a, g, h, i and l did not reside in a conserved chromosome environment, as it is the case of the genes encoding siderophore transporters residing in clusters m and q. however, in general, genes belonging to a given lineage encode transporters present in the same phylogenetic cluster. the dha <dig>  arn and gex gene lineages spanning the species of the saccharomyces complex, ctg complex and the early-divergent hemiascomycetes, p. pastoris and y. lipolytica, are detailed bellow. the order of speciation of the yeasts belonging to the ctg complex adopted in this work was based on the order used in previous phylogenetic studies on hemiascomycetes  <cit> .

dha <dig> gene lineages
the gene neighbourhood analysis allowed the identification of seven dha <dig> gene lineages in the  <dig> hemiascomycetous strains examined . five of these lineages include the ten dha <dig> genes encoded by the genome of s. cerevisiae s288c reference strain.

lineage  <dig> comprises seven sublineages . with the exception of pist_igi <dig> gene, a member of cluster a, lineage  <dig> comprises cluster b-encoding genes. in the saccharomyces complex, three sublineages converge on s. cerevisiae sge <dig>  azr <dig> and vba3/vba <dig> genes. the s. cerevisiae vba <dig> and vba <dig> genes are paralogs originated in a duplication event occurring after s. mikatae speciation. the sequenced genomes of z. rouxii, k. polysporus, c. glabrata and s. castellii species do not possess sge <dig> or vba3/vba <dig> homologs, suggesting that these genes were acquired by the ancestral of the saccharomyces sensu strictu group  by lateral transference. in addition, no synteny was observed between the azr <dig> homologs of lachancea and those of sssg species. in the ctg complex, three sublineages converge on c. albicans casge <dig> gene and on orfs caal_a_ <dig>  and caal_a_ <dig> . two sublineages encompass dha <dig> genes belonging to ctg haploid sub-group species while the origin of the third sublineage is more recent. the cluster b orf of the early-divergent species p. pastoris  resides in a distinct chromosome environment.

with the exception of five amino acid residues and the presence of an extra peptide of  <dig> amino acids in the n terminus, the amino acid sequences encoded by vba <dig> and vba <dig> genes are identical. due to this fact, the plasma membrane localization of vba5p was hypothesized to be dependent on the presence of the extra n-terminal amino acid sequence  <cit> . the analysis of the amino acid sequences of the vba <dig> and vba <dig> homologs showed that, with exception of vba <dig> gene  and orf sace_e_ <dig> , all these genes carry a similar extra n-terminal peptide . in addition, the analysis of translated dna sequence of the upstream region of vba <dig> gene and orf sace_e_ <dig> showed that their n-terminal peptides are still encoded in the genomes of the corresponding s. cerevisiae strains. the n-terminal peptide of orf sace_e_ <dig> is miss-predicted due to the localization of this orf in the extremity of the dna contig  while the coding sequence of the n-terminal peptide in the vba <dig> gene is disrupted by a stop codon .

lineage  <dig> comprises the homologs of s. cerevisiae vba1/vba <dig> genes . this lineage is divided into four sublineages . one extends from ergo2b <dig> to the s. cerevisiae vba <dig> gene, encompassing genes from all species belonging to the saccharomyces complex considered in this study. the genomes of k. polysporus, c. glabrata and s. castellii lack a vba <dig> homolog, resulting in a lineage discontinuity occurring in the transition from pre- to post-wgd species. the third sublineage is composed by two k. waltii and k. thermotolerans genes and by a tandem repeat present in z. rouxii genome. the last sublineage spans genes of the ctg haploid species. the vba1/vba <dig> homolog of the early-divergent hemiascomycetes p. pastoris  does not share common neighbours with the remaining cluster c members.

lineage  <dig> comprises the homologs of s. cerevisiae vba <dig> gene . only the genomes of c. glabrata and s. castellii lack a cluster d-encoding gene  in the  <dig> hemiascomycetous strains considered in this study. the sublineage encompassing the saccharomyces complex species extends from ergo2g <dig> to the s. cerevisiae vba <dig> gene . the paralog of vba <dig> gene was quickly lost after the wgd event. the chromosome environment where the vba <dig> homologs reside in the species of the ctg complex is highly conserved, encompassing also orf yali0e <dig> belonging to the early-divergent hemiascomycete yeast species y. lipolytica. two orfs classified in cluster d present in the p. pastoris genome  do not share common neighbours with the remaining lineage  <dig> genes.

lineage  <dig> comprises the homologs of s. cerevisiae atr <dig> gene and orf ymr279c . the chromosome environment where atr <dig> and ymr279c homologs reside is conserved . the evolutionary history of these genes reproduces a typical wgd pattern, where a pre-wgd lineage splits into two sublineages, each of which gave rise to the s. cerevisiae atr <dig> and ymr279c paralogs . regarding the ctg complex, cluster e-encoding genes show a linear evolutionary history converging on orf caal_a_ <dig> . the early-divergent hemiascomycetes p. pastoris and y. lipolytica do not possess cluster e members.

lineage  <dig> comprises the homologs of s. cerevisiae orf yor378w . this lineage divides into two sublineages . the sublineage spanning the species of the saccharomyces complex shows a discontinuity occurring in the transition from pre- to post-wgd species. although klwa_034-snap. <dig> and klth0c <dig> share two common neighbours with the post-wgd yor378w homologs, the size of this discontinuity suggests that the species of the sssg have acquired their cluster f-encoding genes by lateral gene transfer, plausibly from a pre-wgd yeast. the sublineage spanning the species of the ctg complex converges on c. albicans orf caal_a_ <dig> . the genomes of c. lusitaniae and the early-divergent hemiascomycetes p. pastoris and y. lipolytica lack a cluster f-encoding gene.

lineage  <dig> comprises the homologs of k. lactis knq <dig> gene . besides k. lactis, only the genomes of sssg and lachancea species possess cluster j-encoding genes. however, with the exception of jay- <dig> strain, the s. cerevisiae strains considered in this work lack a cluster j-encoding gene. the lack of knq <dig> homologs by z. rouxii, k. polysporus, c. glabrata, s. castellii and s. kudriavzevii species suggests that the ancestral of the sssg have acquired their cluster f-encoding genes by lateral gene transfer, plausibly from a pre-wgd donor species . the genomes of both early-divergent hemiascomycetes lack a cluster f-encoding gene.

lineage  <dig> comprises genes of species belonging to the ctg complex . a duplication event occurring after the speciation of c. parapsilosis originated two sublineages, converging each on c. albicans orfs caal_a_ <dig>  and on caal_a_ <dig>  . with the exception of yali0d <dig>  cluster k-encoding genes reside in a conserved chromosome environment.

arn gene lineages
this study identified four lineages comprising genes encoding siderophore transporters . three of these lineages comprise the four arn genes encoded in the genome of s. cerevisiae s288c reference strain  <cit>  and one additional lineage comprises the sole c. albicans gene encoding a siderophore transporter  <cit> . the members of the arn gene lineages, as described in  <cit> , reside in the phylogenetic cluster  <dig> a. <dig> .z <dig> 

lineage  <dig> comprises the homologs of s. cerevisiae arn <dig> gene . these genes are only found in the genomes of sssg species . of the five s. cerevisiae strains considered in this work, only the genomes of s288c reference strain and of two wine yeast isolates, the rm11-1a and ec <dig> strains, exhibit arn <dig> homologs.

lineage  <dig> comprises the homologs of s. cerevisiae arn <dig> gene . the chromosome environment where cluster p-encoding genes reside is sparsely conserved, splitting lineage  <dig> into five different sublineages . one sublineage spans the species belonging to the ctg, although c. albicans, c. dubliniensis and l. elongisporus lack cluster p-encoding genes. regarding species belonging to the saccharomyces complex, two sublineages encompass genes from post-wgd species while the remaining two encompass genes from pre-wgd species. the origin of the sublineage containing the s. cerevisiae arn <dig> gene can be traced back to klpo_ <dig> . the amino acid sequence of pipa_3g <dig> is similar to sakl0g <dig> protein, although it does not share common neighbours with the remaining cluster p members.

lineage  <dig> comprises the homologs of caarn <dig> gene . these genes are not related to the s. cerevisiae arn <dig> gene since they do not share common neighbours and do not group in the same phylogenetic cluster. although this lineage spans mainly genes of ctg diploid species, the haploid species p. stipitis also possesses one cluster r orf .

lineage  <dig> comprises the homologs of s. cerevisiae arn1/arn <dig> genes . four sublineages exist within lineage  <dig> , all spanning genes of species belonging to the saccharomyces complex. the origin of the sublineage containing the s. cerevisiae arn <dig> gene could be retraced to a z. rouxii orf . the k. polysporus genome lacks a cluster t-encoding gene suggesting that, after the wgd event, the ancestral of the post-wgd species quickly lost one gene duplicate. the genomes of lachancea species and of k. lactis show an abundant number of cluster t-encoding genes, sparsely syntenic. although the species of the ctg complex lack full-size cluster t-encoding genes, the genome of c. guilliermondii show a gene fragment whose amino acid sequence is highly similar to these transporters. the genomes of the early-divergent hemiascomycetes p. pastoris and y. lipolytica lack cluster t-encoding genes.

the phylogenetic cluster m comprises proteins showing sequence similarity to siderophore transporters . as described by diffels et al.  <cit> , genes encoding cluster m transporters are only present in y. lipolytica genome and reside in the phylogenetic cluster  <dig> a. <dig> .z <dig>  pairwise similarity searches using cluster m amino acid sequences against the aspergillus genome database showed that these proteins share high sequence similarity with aspergillus nidulans mirc , mira  and mirb  proteins, three biochemically characterized siderophore transporters  <cit> .

the amino acid sequence of members of phylogenetic cluster n are closely related to those of siderophore transporters . diffels et al.  <cit>  reported that these proteins group in two different phylogenetic clusters . the gene neighbourhood analysis allowed the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of cluster n-encoding genes . all species belonging to the sssg possess a cluster n transporter and the corresponding genes reside in a conserved chromosome environment . however, with exception of the jay- <dig> strain, all s. cerevisiae strains considered in this work lack a cluster n-encoding gene. cluster n members are also found in species belonging to the ctg haploid sub-group and in the early-divergent hemiascomycetes p. pastoris.

gex gene lineages
lineage  <dig> comprises the homologs of s. cerevisiae gex1/gex <dig> genes . the members of the gex gene lineage reside in the phylogenetic cluster  <dig> a. <dig> .z <dig> . several previous studies indicated that the amino acid sequences of gex1p and gex2p are highly similar to those of arn <dig> and arn <dig> proteins  <cit>  and the analysis of the phylogenetic tree representing the 14-spanner dha <dig>  arn and gex sub-families confirmed this observation . the close resemblance between the members of cluster t  and cluster s  suggests that these two functionally distinct groups of 14-spanner mfs transporters have been differentiated from the same ancestral gene. interestingly, only the genomes of three species belonging to the sssg and of three pre-wgd species were found to encode cluster s-encoding genes in the hemiascomycetes clade . this lineage divides into three sublineages, two containing each s. cerevisiae gex gene while the third one comprises the gex homologs present in the genomes of k. lactis, k. thermotolerans and k. waltii. the discontinuity occurring in lineage  <dig> in the transition from pre- to post-wgd species suggests that the cluster s-encoding genes were acquired by the ancestral of the sssg by lateral gene transfer, presumably from a pre-wgd species.

discussion
a combined approach using classical phylogenetic tree building methods and gene neighbourhood analysis was used to reconstruct the evolution of the dha <dig> genes in the hemiascomycetes. this study considered twenty additional hemiascomycetous species to those examined by gbelska et al. <cit> , which did not included gene neighbourhood analysis. the  <dig> cluster classification of the dha <dig> subfamily proposed in our phylogenetic study considerably expands the previous study  <cit> . members of the phylogenetic clusters b , c , d , e  and f  were found in the majority of the hemiascomycetous species analysed in this study, strongly suggesting that these dha <dig> proteins may sustain important biological functions.

the comparative genomics approach adopted in this work allowed understanding the evolutionary relationships between three s. cerevisiae dha <dig> genes encoding related amino acid sequences: atr <dig> and the uncharacterized orfs ymr279c and yor378w. this approach revealed that the atr <dig> and ymr279c genes are ohnolog genes  while yor378w resides in its own lineage . although the genes comprised in these two lineages do not share common neighbours, this does not exclude the existence of a common evolutionary origin rooting deep in the fungi phylogenetic tree. the close phylogenetic relationship of orf ymr279c with the atr <dig> gene and the fact that its constitutive expression confers resistance to boron in yeast cells through the decrease of the intracellular levels of this element  <cit> , is consistent with the hypothesis that orf ymr279c is a boron extrusion pump acting as a back-up of the atr1p transporter  <cit> . the proteins belonging to cluster e present in the genomes of the pre-wgd yeast species are more similar to atr1p than to the orf ymr279c encoded protein. this may suggest that the ancestral function carried out by these two genes was preserved by atr1p while the putative orf ymr279c boron back-up function is, presumably, a new metabolic feature acquired through functional divergence of one of the redundant gene copies produced at the wgd event.

although a few dha <dig> family transporters have been described as recognizing substrates of biological significance, most of those known to be required for resistance to several drugs and other xenobiotic compounds do not have an assigned biological role yet  <cit> . remarkably, the expression of a number of dha <dig> transporters has been found to confer increased susceptibility, rather than resistance, to specific chemical compounds as well. this is the case of the vba <dig> gene whose overexpression in s. cerevisiae sensitizes the cells to the action of 4-nqo and quinidine  <cit>  or of the orf yor378w whose overexpression leads to increased yeast susceptibility to rapamycin  <cit> . these observations reinforces the idea that the drug pump model used to explain the physiological functions associated to the major facilitator superfamily multidrug resistance  transporters is too simplistic  <cit> .

the phylogenetic study described here strongly suggests that the previous cluster classification of the arn and gex members  <cit>  should be revised. since the time of the previous phylogenetic study, the gex <dig> and gex <dig> genes were shown to encode glutathione exchangers, a biological role that makes them physiologically apart from the arn proteins. the functional classification of the arn and gex proteins into distinct subfamilies cannot ignore the fact that the encoding genes share highly related amino acid sequences  and that their expression is activated under conditions of iron depletion, although gex gene expression only occurs under extreme iron scarcity  <cit> . the main transcription regulator of the expression of the four arn genes is aft1p  <cit>  while the expression of gex <dig> gene is under control of the transcription factor aft2p  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae aft <dig> and aft <dig> genes are paralogs  <cit>  that specialized during yeast evolution to perform overlapping but not redundant functions  <cit> . the close amino acid sequence similarity between the arn and gex proteins suggests that the encoding genes may share a common evolutionary origin and that posterior divergence led to their differentiation, both in sequence and regulation, to fulfill different physiological functions.

consistent with the notion that siderophore uptake is strongly dependent on the genetic background of the yeast strain  <cit> , the present study also uncovered important variations in the arsenal of siderophore transporters encoded in genomes of different s. cerevisiae strains. while s288c and ec <dig> strains do possess both arn <dig> and arn <dig> genes, the genomes of the remaining s. cerevisiae strains examined in this study only have the arn <dig> gene suggesting that the former strains may have acquired the arn <dig> gene by lateral gene transfer, presumably from a pre-wgd donor species. the genomes of s. cerevisiae strains jay <dig> and yjm <dig> also lack an arn <dig> homolog. interestingly, arn <dig> homologs only exist in sssg species, all residing in sub-telomeric regions. these chromosomal regions are thought to serve as nursery for new genes and to provide a reservoir where new haplotypes and new gene functions can be created  <cit> . however, the inspection of the chromosome neighbourhood where each arn <dig> homolog resides did not provide any clue regarding the origin of this hypothetical primordial gene.

the synteny and similarity data suggests that lateral gene transfer and gene duplication were the main evolutionary forces responsible for the expansion of genes encoding dha <dig>  arn and gex transporters in the hemiascomycetes. lateral gene transfer is proposed to have occur in lineage  <dig> , lineage  <dig> , lineage  <dig> , lineage  <dig> , lineage  <dig> , lineage  <dig>  and lineage  <dig> . gene duplication, the primary source of new genes necessary for the evolution of functional novelty  <cit> , was found to be a frequent event in the majority of dha <dig>  arn and gex gene lineages reconstructed in this study. the consistent evolutionary pattern of a surplus of duplicate genes belonging to the same phylogenetic cluster found to occur in certain hemiascomycetous genomes raises the question of how many of these genes are still functionally redundant and how many have already been co-opted through neofunctionalization or sub-functionalization to fulfil new physiological functions in the corresponding yeast strains. although the majority of the genes encoding dha <dig>  arn and gex transporters are not essential in laboratorial optimal conditions, the widespread occurrence of lateral transfer and duplication events of these genes during the evolution of the hemiascomycetes suggest that the encoded proteins may sustain important physiological functions in the diverse range of ecological niches occupied by these yeasts in nature. considering that multidrug resistance and iron uptake are major determinants of yeast virulence, the identification of the complete set of dha <dig> and arn transporters present in the genomes of ten candida pathogenic species provides potential new molecular targets for antifungal drug development.

the phylogenetic results emerging from this work together with new experimental results recently reported in the literature concerning the dha <dig>  arn and gex transporters should be considered for the eventual revision of protein family classification used in tcdb database  <cit> . in specific, the biochemically characterized s. cerevisiae gex <dig>  gex <dig>  vba <dig>  c. albicans caarn <dig> and k. lactis knp <dig> transporters with a demonstrated function in yeast physiology should be included in tcdb database. moreover, the finding that orf ymr279c is the paralog of atr <dig> gene with origin in the wgd event and that it is also involved in boron homeostasis suggest its classification in the same tcdb family of atr1p.

this study provides evidence for a close amino acid sequence similarity between the dha <dig>  arn and gex proteins. the fact that these 14-spanner transporters of the major facilitator superfamily are hypothesized to recognize distinct substrates and may have different subcellular localization, at the plasma membrane, the vacuole membrane, post-golgi vesicles and late endosomal vesicles  <cit> , suggests that it is unlikely that their sequence similarity may result from convergent evolution. the hypothesis that dha <dig>  arn and gex transporters share a common evolutionary root is the explanation that better fits the results of this phylogenetic study and we propose a new family to accommodate the dha <dig>  arn and gex proteins, dag, spanning these three phylogenetic subfamilies of 14-spanner mfs transporters. this hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that these three subfamilies appeared during the evolutionary transition giving birth to the dikarya fungi . subsequently, selection, radiation and neofunctionalization of the initial ancestral genes encoding these 14-spanner mfs transporters gave rise to the functions associated with them, spanning the mdr phenomenon, amino acid transport, boron homeostasis, siderophore transport and glutathione exchange.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig>  translated orfs encoded in the genomes of  <dig> sequenced yeast strains from  <dig> hemiascomycetous species were gathered in this study. the corresponding amino acid sequences were compared using the blastp algorithm, generating a total of  <dig> million pairwise alignments, represented as a network. a functionally characterized dha <dig> protein, atr1p, was used as starting node to breadth-first traverse this network at different e-value thresholds. 14-spanner major facilitator superfamily transporters involved in siderophore import  <cit>  and glutathione export  <cit>  were gathered together with the dha <dig> proteins, supporting the concept that the genes encoding the dha <dig>  arn and gex proteins share a common evolutionary origin. the new protein family spanning these three phylogenetic subfamilies was denominated the dag protein family and a phylogenetic tree representing the full-size dag proteins was built. gene neighbourhood analysis of the chromosome environment where the dha <dig>  arn and gex genes reside allowed the identification of seven dha <dig> gene lineages, five arn gene lineages and one gex gene lineage. lateral gene transfer and gene duplication were important mechanisms underlying the evolution of the dag genes in the hemiascomycetes.
