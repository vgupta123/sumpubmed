BACKGROUND
stramenopiles represent an enormous eukaryotic assemblage of  <dig>  to one million species which includes both algae and colorless protists  <cit> . algal representatives within this major branch in the tree of life are exceptionally diverse. they include recently discovered minute, picoplanktonic unicells , as well as colonial forms , the silicious diatoms , and the large pseudoparenchymatous kelps , which may attain lengths of at least  <dig> feet. these autotrophic eukaryotes serve as primary producers that fix at least 40% of the total carbon processed on earth and significantly impact global sulfur and nitrogen cycles  <cit> . although some stramenopiles adversely affect aquaculture endeavors and ecosystem health through formation of toxic blooms  <cit> , others form dense underwater forests which serve as habitat for myriad vertebrate and invertebrate species. stramenopiles are not only used extensively in industry, in aquaculture and as a human food source, but they also provide research opportunities for novel pharmaceutical discovery and nanotechnological development  <cit> .

autotrophic stramenopiles evolved approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . their chloroplasts  significantly differ from those of green algae, land plants or rhodophytes , in morphology, pigment composition, storage materials and chromosome gene content  <cit> . for this reason, one cannot assume identical chloroplast function among representatives of these disparate taxa. presently, over  <dig> chloroplast genomes have been sequenced, predominantly from terrestrial plants. in contrast, few molecular data exist describing the underlying genetic profiles of chloroplast dna  among the approximately  <dig> classes of autotrophic stramenopiles. at this writing, the only stramenopile chloroplast genomes that have been published, are those of the diatoms odontella sinensis, thalassiosira pseudonana  and phaeodactylum tricornutum   <cit> . one factor that has hindered progress in stramenopile chloroplast genome sequencing is difficulty in obtaining purified cpdna. typically, this process is accomplished by physically isolating chloroplasts before dna extraction, or by separating cpdna from mitochondrial and nuclear dna in cesium chloride gradients. the first approach is extremely difficult in this group of organisms, particularly those of picoplanktonic size, and the second is labor intensive, requiring sufficient biomass for dna isolation, and repeated series of multi-day centrifugation spins  <cit> .

in this study we sequenced the chloroplast genome of two heterosigma akashiwo  strains originating from west atlantic  and west pacific  coastal waters. we initiated our study of h. akashiwo cpdna using a standard shotgun sequencing method with highly purified cpdna retrieved from over  <dig> liters of cell culture. alternatively, to bypass the tedious process of cpdna purification, we used a simplified whole genome fosmid cloning approach to determine cpdna sequences. for each strain, we constructed a fosmid library using whole cellular dna  from approximately  <dig> liters of culture. chloroplast clones were selected from the total genomic dna preparations using bioinformatic analysis of fosmid end-sequences, obtained via high throughput sequencing. sequencing fosmid subclones independently aided in final finishing of the genomes, as has been discussed previously  <cit> .

heterosigma akashiwo is a small , naturally wall-less unicell that forms toxic brown tides in temperate and subtropical regions world-wide  <cit> . as a coastal-dwelling organism, h. akashiwo also contributes significantly to primary productivity within these critically important ecosystems  <cit> . significant research on its morphology  <cit> , physiology  <cit> , molecular biology  <cit> , toxicology  <cit> , and biochemistry  <cit>  define h. akashiwo as one of the most broadly studied non-diatomaceous stramenopiles. much of this attention has been focused on events associated with chloroplast biology. for example, both photoperiod and light intensity determine the number of chloroplasts per cell  and the phase, amplitude and period of their synchronized division  <cit> . a chloroplast run-on transcription system  not only shows that chloroplast rna abundance is regulated predominantly at the transcriptional level, but that transcriptional response is also modified by the physiological challenges imposed on the cell  <cit> . an average h. akashiwo cell contains about  <dig> copies of its chloroplast genome  <cit> . electron microscope studies  <cit> , combined with restriction enzyme digestion  <cit> , reassociation kinetic analysis  <cit> , and physical mapping  <cit>  reveal that the approximately  <dig> kb h. akashiwo chloroplast genome is a circular molecule which contains a large, inverted repeat . demonstration of a chloroplast-encoded rubisco small subunit  <cit>  and documentation of the presence of bacterial-like two-component signal transduction arrays  <cit>  gave early evidence that the chloroplast genome of h. akashiwo may be functionally distinct from those of green algae and land plants.

the existence of an extensive database augments h. akashiwo's potential as a model system for studies in stramenopile chloroplast evolution and biogenesis. it has been suggested that h. akashiwo strain ccmp <dig> serve as the reference genotype for this organism  <cit> . new data reported here show that the chloroplast genome sequence of h. akashiwo:  displays marginal synteny with other chloroplast genomes including those of the diatoms;  contains six genes encoding proteins of unknown function;  lacks introns; and  has genes that appear to have been obtained via lateral transfer.

RESULTS
sequencing strategy: conventional vs. fosmid approach
we compared two methods to obtain sequencing templates for these two strains, a standard cscl cpdna preparation, and total genomic dna cloning into fosmid vectors. using the standard approach, cscl-purified h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> cpdna was cloned into puc <dig> plasmids and sequenced by the conventional shotgun cloning described in the materials and methods. a total of  <dig> clones were sequenced in both forward and reverse direction, providing greater than 8Ã— coverage, given an average read length of  <dig> base pairs  and an estimated genome size of  <dig>  bp. purification of cpdna sequencing template by this commonly used method was extremely labor intensive. it required the generation of large quantities of cells followed by the recovery of highly purified cpdna using cscl gradients. to avoid these technical challenges, we adapted a large-insert  cloning method for total genomic dna to cpdna sequencing . this fosmid cloning method requires minimal biological material and avoids the isolation of pure cpdna. our conventionally sequenced h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> chloroplast genome served as a reference for this endeavor. briefly, total genomic dna  was used to construct a large insert fosmid library. using high-throughput fosmid dna isolation and end-sequencing methods, these fosmids were then end-sequenced from their vector/insert junctions to determine clones of chloroplast origin.

chloroplast fosmid identity was determined two ways. the sequenced fosmid ends were compared to:  the draft sequence generated by the shotgun method and  a customized blast database consisting only of published chloroplast genome sequences. earlier reports used hybridization to macroarrays comprised of chloroplast-genomic probes to screen for cpdna-containing clones  <cit> . in contrast, our end-sequence based approach does not rely on a priori knowledge of the cpdna sequence. hybridization screening could produce a high number of false positives given the homology of chloroplast gene sequences to bacterial and nuclear gene sequences, or missed clones given the divergence of stramenopile genes at the dna sequence level. in addition, our method is easily updated and made more powerful as newly sequenced chloroplast genomes are added to the reference database. for additional genomes of autotrophic stramenopile taxa sequenced entirely from fosmids , we have found that relatively little finishing is required to obtain the complete genome once chloroplast genome fosmids are sequenced . of  <dig>  fosmids generated from h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> total dna, twenty gave clear chloroplast signatures when compared to the draft conventionally sequenced genome. all twenty of these fosmids were also identified using the genome-independent bioinformatic approach, demonstrating that this method is feasible for de novo sequencing. eight fosmids were fully sequenced to assemble the h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> chloroplast genome .

because the fosmid cloning technique for generating template dna proved to be rapid, efficient and cost effective, it was also chosen to sequence the cpdna of h. akashiwo nies <dig>  west pacific strain. a total of  <dig>  fosmids were end-sequenced using high-throughput methods to identify fosmids of chloroplast origin for sequencing.  <dig>  additional clones were screened by real time pcr once the partial genome sequence had been obtained. primers were designed from the draft genome sequence to search for clones that spanned gaps. in total twenty three fosmids were identified as chloroplast-derived and ten of these fosmids were fully sequenced to assemble the h. akashiwo nies <dig> chloroplast genome .

as noted above, although our ongoing studies show that entire stramenopile chloroplast genomes are clonable into fosmids, the fosmid coverage for both h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> and nies <dig> cpdna was not complete. fosmids generated from some cpdna domains were abundant, whereas others were minimal. as shown in fig.  <dig>  great difficulty in fosmid recovery was experienced for an identical region in both h. akashiwo strains. the reasons for extremely low coverage in this particular cpdna region are not known. one might suggest that the genes encoded in this region  influence the survival of bacterial host cells during fosmid library construction. alternatively, insert packaging could be impeded by the presence of structural anomalies, such as branched replication or recombination intermediates, within a localized region of the cpdna.

pcr was used to span those areas of the genome that were not found in clone libraries. for example, a gap of approximately  <dig> kb existed in nies <dig> for which no fosmid clone was retrieved. to close this gap, a series of pcr primers was designed to create  <dig> bp products, offset by an average of  <dig> bp per product. primers were designed using the completed ccmp <dig> cpdna sequence as reference. the sequenced pcr products were assembled, and confirmed to overlap with the fosmid sequences flanking the gaps. similarly, a  <dig>  kb gap in ccmp <dig> lacking shotgun clones was spanned by sequencing a single pcr product.

global genome structure
the h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> chloroplast genome is  <dig>  bp in size . this chromosome contains a  <dig>  bp ir which divides the molecule into large single copy  and small single copy  domains . the  <dig>  bp h. akashiwo nies <dig> chloroplast genome is shorter in the ir  as well as the lsc  and ssc  domains . notably, the h. akashiwo nies <dig> ssc domain contains an ~ <dig>  kb inversion when compared to that of h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> . an overall gc content of  <dig> % is seen for ccmp <dig> while a gc content of  <dig> % occurs in nies <dig> cpdna .

* this table reports total numbers of genes. each of the two irs contains  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> genes for trnas and  <dig> rrna operon.

the genomes of both h. akashiwo strains exist in two isomeric configurations. both sequencing fosmids that span the repeats, and long pcr confirmed this observation. for h. akashiwo ccmp <dig>  three fosmids  which spanned the entire repeat, including some part of both single copy domains, were chosen for shotgun sequence analysis. two of these fosmids  assembled into isomeric form a  while the third showed the alternate isomer, form b. similarly, for h. akashiwo nies <dig>  three sequenced fosmids spanned the irs, one belonging to isomeric form a  and two to the alternate form b  . to further confirm the presence of two isomeric forms in h. akashiwo ccmp <dig>  primers designed to the ends of each single copy region  were used in multiple combinations in long pcr to probe for the presence of both potential configurations. the isomers found in these chloroplast genomes may have been formed by a recombination event within the ir which resulted in the inversion of the single copy domains relative to one another .

the observation that cpdnas exist as a heterogeneous population is not new. in  <dig>  palmer hypothesized that a recombination event within the ir of phaseolus vulgaris generated an equimolar population of isomeric cpdna molecules which differed only by the orientation of their single copy regions  <cit> . the subsequent demonstration of "polarity reversal" of the single copy region resulting in the generation of isomeric cpdnas in angiosperms  <cit> , in a chlorophytic alga  <cit> , in the stramenopiles vaucheria bursa  <cit> , cyclotella meneghiniana  <cit> , and h. akashiwo , argues for the widespread occurrence of this process across divergent taxa. our fosmid cloning approach eliminates the laborious process of using extensive restriction analysis of cpdna to document the flipping of single copy domains. by judiciously choosing fosmids , one can easily document cpdna isomerization. an additional advantage of the fosmid technique is that the investigator can readily distinguish the identity of ir number one from ir number two. in conventional shotgun sequencing strategies, assignment of a sequence to a specific repeat domain is frequently challenging  <cit> , especially if the ir is large, as is often found in terrestrial plants. when assembling the genome from shotgun data, the large ir elements collapse and final finishing typically requires in-silico duplication of the ir to complete the genome sequence. this approach may lead to errors, especially if the repeats are not identical as seen in the cryptophyte guillardia theta  <cit> .

it is well established that repeat size can both expand and contract  <cit> . the ~ <dig> kb h. akashiwo ir is similar in size to that found in t. pseudonana , c. meneghiniana , and skeletonema costatum ) but significantly larger than the  <dig> kb  repeat domain seen in the genomes of rhodophytes and most algae that contain chloroplasts of secondary endosymbiotic origin  <cit> . many stramenopile chloroplast genomes appear to maintain an ir   <cit> . new sequencing data suggest that other stramenopile chloroplast genomes may lack this architectural feature altogether . although data are sparse, haptophyte  <cit>  and cryptophyte  <cit>  chloroplasts also appear to maintain a small ir. rhodophyte chloroplast genomes  <cit>  display an inverted or direct repeat  or may lack a repeat entirely .

gene content
the h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> and nies <dig> genomes are co-linear with respect to gene content, with exception of ten genes  which are located within the ~ <dig>  kb inversion inside the small single copy region . an overall protein coding content of  <dig> % is seen for ccmp <dig> and  <dig>  % occurs in nies <dig> cpdna .

rna genes include the ribosomal rna operons, one copy in each ir, one tmrna, one threonine pseudo-transfer rna , and  <dig> trna genes whose anticodons encompass  <dig> different amino acids. seven of these trna genes are located in each ir, resulting in a total of  <dig> distinct trna genes. three trna genes have anticodons for methionine, although previous studies suggest one of these trnas may be subsequently modified to a trna isoleucine  <cit> . also present is the widely conserved trna glutamine , which contributes to translation and also plays an integral role in the biosynthetic pathway of Î´-aminolevulinic acid, the precursor for generating the tetrapyrole-containing pigments, heme, chlorophyll and bilin in bacteria and algae as well as in terrestrial plants  <cit> . many codons found in the genes of the h. akashiwo genomes have no corresponding anticodon in the trnas that are encoded in the cpdna. although trnas are imported into the mitochondrion  <cit> , presently there is no evidence that they are similarly imported into the chloroplast. comparing the codon usage of the predicted orfs to the anticodons of the resident trna complement, one might suggest that 50% of the trnas use a wobble base at the third codon position. this codon-anticodon discrepancy is also present in other chloroplast genomes of secondary endosymbiotic origin.

both h. akashiwo chloroplast genomes contain genes encoding  <dig> predicted proteins, including a core set of  <dig> genes which are conserved in all chloroplast genomes sequenced to date. an additional  <dig> genes are conserved in chloroplast genomes of rhodophytes and in algae with chloroplast genomes of secondary endosymbiotic origin  <cit> . of the  <dig> genes for predicted proteins, approximately one-third encode products used in photosynthesis or energy generation. all the atp synthase genes  are found with the exception of atpc; all the genes of the electron transfer chain  as well as genes important in calvin cycle function  are also present. the genomes also contain  <dig> conserved hypothetical genes common to other chloroplast genomes  and six open reading frames with no sequence homology to genes in other chloroplast genomes.

the chloroplast genomes of h. akashiwo and the diatoms t. pseudonana, o. sinensis, and p. tricornutum have diverged in gene content. the three diatom genomes are extremely similar in gene content; there are only  <dig> genes  encoded by at least one but not all  <dig> of these algae. in contrast, although both diatoms and h. akashiwo share an identical set of  <dig> protein-coding genes , h. akashiwo also maintains genes found in rhodophytic cpdna . conversely, the three diatoms contain seven genes not present in h. akashiwo .

novel genes
we have now entered an era in which the comparative genomics of autotrophic eukaryotes can be studied. by cataloguing genes from broadly sampled taxa, we increase both our understanding of chloroplast evolution and gain insight into biochemical mechanisms that drive chloroplast homeostasis. however, this task is not easily accomplished, for chloroplast genomes probably represent a chimeric assemblage of genes which originate from both ancestral symbiont and lateral gene transfer events. for example, the h. akashiwo chloroplast genome retains the genes trg <dig> and tsg <dig>  encoding a functional two-component his-to-asp signal transduction circuit  <cit> . similar circuits are found in all cyanobacterial cells, the putative ancestral source of chloroplast genomes. the sensor kinase/response regulator protein pair is responsible for converting physiological information from the environment to a program that regulates gene transcription. although genes for one or both of these proteins are found in most genomes of rhodophytic lineage, no his-to-asp pair is encoded in the three diatom cpdnas which have been sequenced. thus by analyzing these proteins, we document the retention of ancestral proteins , and describe a mechanism of gene regulation which is confined to a specific taxonomic cluster . expanding this approach, we have determined a possible function for two additional genes present in h. akashiwo which have not been found in any other chloroplast genome.

tyrc
both h. akashiwo chloroplast genomes contain a gene that encodes a putative site-specific tyrosine recombinase, which we have named tyrc . the translated h. akashiwo tyrc protein is  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in length in strains nies <dig> and ccmp <dig> respectively . in strain nies <dig> residues  <dig> and  <dig> are lacking. a significant change in the ccmp <dig> tyrc gene is effected by the inversion that occurs in the ssc region of this genome . this flip relocates  <dig> bp of the tyrc 3' terminus to a new location which is ~ <dig>  kb downstream. the predicted amino acids encoded by the displaced region in ccmp <dig> retain 100% sequence identity to those present in the intact nies <dig> protein.

proteins with the greatest similarity to the putative h. akashiwo recombinase are found in the mitochondrial genomes of prototheca wickerhamii, a chlorophyte closely related to chlorella vulgaris, and in the charophyte chaetosphaeridium globosum . in addition to these algal mitochondrial tyrosine recombinases, h. akashiwo tyrc has amino acid sequence similarity to the recombinases found in lactobacillus leichmannii, picrophilus torridus and methanococcus maripaludis. furthermore, the h. akashiwo tyrc genes have a 25% gc content in the third codon position, markedly higher than the 14% average for genes on the h. akashiwo cpdna, suggesting that this gene may be the product of a lateral gene transfer event.

because there is such a limited sequence similarity among known integrases the identification of these proteins often relies upon the identification of essential catalytic residues  <cit> . the putative h. akashiwo tyrc protein contains numerous motifs defined for the integrase family of recombinases  <cit> . this protein retains the critically important catalytic residues : arg  <dig> , his  <dig>  arg  <dig> and tyr  <dig> . these residues have been shown to lie close to the active site when the protein is folded. mutation of any one of these amino acids reduces or eliminates recombinase activity  <cit> . all bacterial sequences with similarity to h. akashiwo tyrc noted above also retain the arg-his-arg amino acid triad as well as the tyr nucleophile component. additionally, h. akashiwo tyrc displays the highly conserved domains designated box i and ii by nunes-duby and colleagues  <cit>  in their comparative analysis of  <dig> site-specific recombinases.

though the tyrc gene is expressed in both h. akashiwo strains , presently, we can only speculate on the function of its translated protein product. in bacteria, site-specific recombination often utilizes the tyrosine recombinase pair xerc and xerd, which may be evolutionary derivatives of a single ancestral protein  <cit> . conventionally, the xerc/d protein pair breaks and rejoins dna strands at short, conserved,  <dig> base-pair domains  through the formation of holliday junction intermediates  <cit> . this docking domain usually consists of two 11-base-pair "arms" with a 6-nucleotide central region . four types of putative dif recognition domains are present in the h. akashiwo chloroplast genomes . whether these nucleotide domains truly serve as points for intramolecular recombination, or sites where multimeric  <cit>  h. akashiwo cpdna molecules are converted to monomers, warrants further experimentation.

trans-membrane protein
an extremely large protein comprised of  <dig> amino acids is encoded in the ir of both strains . expression of this large gene has been verified by quantitative rt-pcr in both strains . a variety of sequence analysis techniques have been used to gain some insight into the nature of this unique chloroplast gene. standard blast queries against all routinely available databases reveal no significant known homologs. searches with psi-blast  <cit>  indicate that the most closely related proteins in standard databases are a series of putative g protein-coupled receptors  in c. elegans. other significant partial hits  include fmlp receptors , lsh receptor , melanocortin- <dig> receptor , and metabotropic glutamate receptor  <dig> . hydrophobicity analyses and membrane topology prediction suggest that the undescribed h. akashiwo protein sequence possesses seven probable transmembrane segments; the length and hydrophobic residue repeat patterns in the putative transmembrane segments are consistent with an alpha-helical structural motif. the qualitative features of the transmembrane helix prediction profiles are more similar to the profiles observed in other g protein-coupled receptors from the rhodopsin/beta-adrenergic class  than they are to bacterial halorhodopsin proteins, which have seven strong transmembrane segments  <cit> .

attempts to align the undescribed h. akashiwo protein sequence with a collection of sequences from the rhodopsin/beta-adrenergic  receptor family were largely unsuccessful. we were unable to generate an alignment although the h. akashiwo protein sequence displays 12â€“18% amino acid sequence identity with various members of a compiled gpcr data set, comparable to the sequence identity observed for bovine rhodopsin with many adrenergic receptors. the h. akashiwo protein sequence does exhibit some key signature features of g protein-coupled receptors, such as an nrf motif at the carboxy terminal end of the third putative transmembrane segment, which is an observed variant of the well-characterized dry motif in the gpcr superfamily. in contrast the h. akashiwo protein sequence does not possess the highly conserved disulfide bond observed in the extracellular loops of many gpcrs. the h. akashiwo protein does possess a number of glycosylation, myristoylation, and phosphorylation sites in combinations and locations similar those observed for g-protein-coupled-receptor sequences.

on the basis of these analyses, the h. akashiwo protein sequence appears to be an integral membrane protein with seven probable transmembrane segments. it exhibits sequence characteristics that suggest it may be a g protein-coupled receptor, related most closely to the rhodopsin/beta-adrenergic receptor family, although we have not been able to generate convincing pairwise or multiple sequence alignments with other members of the gpcr superfamily. if the h. akashiwo protein sequence is indeed the first member of the gpcr superfamily in the chloroplast of an alga, it is obviously strongly diverged from the gpcrs seen in animals. however, because this protein looks far more like a g protein-coupled receptor than it does anything else currently present in sequence databases, more detailed biochemical characterization of the h. akashiwo protein sequence is warranted.

gene arrangement
four protein-coding genes use gtg starts . there is no consistency within stramenopiles or rhodophytes for chloroplast genes that initiate with a non-atg start. two sets of overlapping genes are common to both genomes: psbc and psbd , and heak452cp_021/groel . additionally, in ccmp <dig>  the heak452_cp <dig> /chli genes overlap by  <dig> codons. however, a one base-pair insertion in nies <dig> results in a frame shift that causes orf <dig> and chli genes to be contiguous. sequence alignment of nies <dig> orf <dig> and the functional ccmp <dig> 96-amino acid sequence shows that the amino termini of these polypeptides are virtually identical . given that ccmp <dig> orf <dig> is differentially expressed over the cell cycle  <cit> , it will be of interest to determine whether the altered nies <dig> protein retains its functionality.

unlike terrestrial plant and green algal chloroplast genomes, but similar to rhodophytic chloroplast genomes and other chloroplast genomes of secondary endosymbiotic origin, no introns have been detected in h. akashiwo chloroplast-encoded genes. however, a conserved putative intein  <cit>  in dnab is maintained, and numerous other genes encode proteins that contain in-frame amino acid deletions or insertions when compared to homologues in other algal chloroplast genomes. proteins having the largest inserts include clpc  and rpoa . among the  <dig> protein-coding genes modified by inserts, it appears that some common functional identities occur. these include five members of the atp complex, atpa , d , g , b  and e  as well as five ribosomal proteins, rpl <dig> , rpl <dig> , rps <dig> , rps <dig> , and rps <dig> . proteins that have significant, extended carboxy termini include rps <dig> , ycf <dig> , and clpc . comparison of genomic sequences to cdnas generated for clpc, rpoa, rpl <dig>  rps <dig>  and rps <dig> shows that the inserts are retained in mature mrna. whether they are removed after translation remains unknown.

globally, h. akashiwo cpdna in either isomeric form shows little synteny with published cpdnas , though sub-domains of conservation in gene placement are evident. as in other chloroplast genomes of the rhodophytic or secondary endosymbiotic lineage, the ribosomal protein genes occur in clusters. the largest of these conserved arrays is the "ribosomal protein block" which includes  <dig> ribosomal genes as well as tufa, rpoa and secy  <cit> . dnak is almost universally found 3' to this ribosomal protein-coding domain. this gene cluster may represent an evolutionarily conserved, prokaryotic-like transcriptional operon in which large numbers of ribosomal protein genes are co-transcribed  <cit> . indeed, northern analysis using probes spanning the entire "ribosomal protein block" of g. theta cpdna revealed the production of an mrna transcript of approximately  <dig> kb. smaller mrnas in this northern analysis, likely a product of primary transcript processing, were also detected  <cit> .

numerous smaller, intact motifs seen in all rhodophytic and secondary endosymbiotic chloroplasts examined to date are maintained in h. akashiwo cpdna. among the conserved gene clusters are the atpb/atpe and atpi/atph/atpg/atpf/atpd/atpa complexes, the ribosomal genes rpl11/rpl1/rpl12; rpl27/rpl <dig>  the photosynthetic genes psaa/psab, psbd/psbc, psbb/psbt/psbn/psbh as well as the calvin cycle rbcl/rbcs genes  . conservation in gene order is maintained in the placement of the h. akashiwo initiator methionine trna. as in rhodophytes and algae having chloroplasts of secondary endosymbiotic origin, this trna is embedded between psad and ycf <dig>  interestingly, rps <dig>  which is adjacent to initiator methionine trna in most green algae and land plants, lies immediately upstream of the psad gene in the h. akashiwo chloroplast genomes. in the rhodophytic lineage the rpo c2c <dig> b1/rps20/glnb/rpl33/rps <dig> polymerase cluster appears to have undergone dissolution through a series of independent events. two genes  in the cluster appear to have been targeted for removal or transfer to the nucleus. the intact cluster is present in porphyra purpurea and p. yezoensis. cluster integrity is maintained in h. akashiwo, o. sinensis, p. tricornutum, g. theta and g. tenuistipitata, although glnb is lost. in c. caldarium rps <dig> rather than glnb has been eliminated. a. lagunensis lacks both rps <dig> and glnb, as does the haptophyte emiliania huxleyi, which also splits rpoc2c <dig> b <dig> and rpl33/rps <dig> into distantly-located clusters.

analysis of cluster integrity has been a valuable tool in the assessment of phylogenetic identity and evolutionary processes . the data presented here give evidence that both gene cluster maintenance and dissolution have occurred in the h. akashiwo chloroplast genomes. unfortunately, comparative analysis of gene flux solely within the stramenopiles is hampered by the paucity of available data, since h. akashiwo is the only non-diatom genome published from this group. however, the small data set available already suggests that the stramenopiles will present a significant challenge, especially in deciphering the dynamics of gene cluster flux and variations in gene co-linearity patterns within this taxon.

indels and snps
though the genomes of h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> and nies <dig> are largely co-linear and have identical gene content, there are  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  between them. within the  <dig> protein-coding genes containing snps, both synonymous  and/or non-synonymous  changes are noted . these changes occur in informational  as well as operational  genes. also seen are small, variable regions containing deletions and insertions of one to six nucleotides. these small variable regions are clustered into "hot spots" which appear throughout the genome . additionally, six large, variable regions, which are predominantly located in the ssc region, represent the major cpdna sequences between the two h. akashiwo strains.

the extent to which cpdna sequence varies among h. akashiwo ecotypes is not known. unicellular algae, such as h. akashiwo, often exist in high-density populations that are generated via rapid cell division. if dna replication serves as a mutational driver, then chloroplast genetic profiles might be expected to shift during the biogenesis of an algal bloom  <cit> . when examining genetic difference between strains, analyzing incomplete genomes or standard nuclear markers may be misleading. for example, analysis of chloroplast rbcl/s as well as nuclear 18s and its rdna  suggested that approximately  <dig> h. akashiwo strains of different geographic origin were of identical genotype . this conclusion led the authors to propose that geographic distribution of h. akashiwo is due to a global dispersal mechanism. by sequencing whole genomes, the presence of appreciable genetic differences in cpdna between strains was made clear, and suggests a diverged ancestry for ccmp <dig> and nies <dig>  continued sequence analysis of additional strains may show an even greater variation among h. akashiwo populations. for example, six variants of the cfxq gene  are seen when  <dig> h. akashiwo strains are analyzed . in-silico modeling suggests that the non-synonymous changes observed in the sequence of cfxq, may impact protein function  <cit> .

repeats
analysis of the h. akashiwo chloroplast genome reveals the presence of numerous at-rich repeats . ccmp <dig> has  <dig> inverted and  <dig> tandem repeats that represent  <dig> % of the total genome, whereas nies <dig> cpdna has  <dig> inverted and  <dig> tandem repeats encompassing  <dig> % of this genome. both strains retain many identical repeat structures. substitution, loss or gain of nucleotides within a repeat motif is not confined to one h. akashiwo strain. essentially all major changes in these repeat elements occur within intergenic regions.

c-centric diatom; p-pennate diatom f-floridiophyte b-bangiophyte

inverted repeats found in h. akashiwo cpdna are comprised of a stem structure which ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length . the loop domain of these inverted repeat arrays is very small, averaging only  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  bp. thus the average inverted repeat structure is approximately  <dig> bp in size. tandem repeats have a period of  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  bp  or  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  bp  with a copy number ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . thus, the average tandem repeat element is  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  bp in size. whether the repeat size maintenance of approximately  <dig> bp for both inverted and tandem repeats has functional significance is not known.

notably, many repeats  are localized within the spacer region that lies between the 3' terminus of two genes that are transcribed toward one another on opposite dna strands. these "shared repeats" are located at seventeen identical sites within h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> and nies <dig> cpdna including between psba /psbc, psac/ccsa, psal/peta, psai/clpc, ycf54/psby and ycf30/petj. ccmp <dig> has three additional sites. the observation of repeat sharing between two genes is similar to that seen in bacterial genomes where inverted repeats with stem lengths longer than eight nucleotide pairs are found most frequently in "short non-coding regions bounded by two 3' ends of convergent genes"  <cit> . additionally, both h. akashiwo genomes have repeats, at  <dig> identical sites, that lie in the spacer region between genes that are transcribed on the same dna strand. in some cases, inverted repeats overlap with the genes themselves. the largest examples include overlaps at the 3' end of psbi , psai , petd , and dnak . repeats are also found internal to genes. ccmp <dig> orf <dig> , which overlaps chli, contains a perfect  <dig> base pair tandem repeat. this repeat is located  <dig> bases 5' to the atg start of chli  <cit> . a tandem repeat is also found within the 3' terminus of rpob .

dispersed repeats occur in both h. akashiwo ccmp <dig> and nies <dig> chloroplast genomes, but they are of low similarity and number . the largest and most similar of these are conserved between the two h. akashiwo genomes. these elements are likely to have limited influence on recombination, unlike those observed for chlamydomonas reinhardtii  <cit> .

though repeats are found in rhodophytic chloroplast genomes and other chloroplast genomes of secondary endosymbiotic origin, they are often present at a much lower frequency than that seen in h. akashiwo . the glaucophyte cyanophora paradoxa and the thermo-tolerant unicell, c. merolae, appear to be exceptions to this observation. the former retains high numbers of both tandem and inverted motifs while the latter appears to have retained almost exclusively tandem arrays.

it was of interest to determine whether a repeat structure is associated with a specific gene and whether that association is maintained among chloroplast genomes that maintain regional, but little global , gene co-linearity. notably, genes encoding cytochromes appear to be targeted for repeat embellishment. in h. akashiwo an inverted repeat is found within the 3' spacer of all pet genes  and the gene cssa, which encodes a cytochrome assembly protein  <cit> . this pattern of inverted repeat localization for the cytochrome complex is partially maintained in all the taxa examined in table  <dig>  also striking is the uniformity of repeat placement among many taxa in the 3' spacer adjacent to rbcs, rps <dig>  and atpa genes. for example in the glaucophyte c. paradoxa not only is an inverted repeat associated with the 3' termini of pet a, b/d, f, g, l, rbcs, and atpa, but a 3' inverted repeat remains associated with rps <dig> even though the "ribosomal protein block" is significantly disrupted in this chloroplast genome. maintenance of repeat association with a specific gene is particularly notable in a genome such as p. purpurea, which has many coding genes  and few repeats . in this red algal chloroplast genome, the probability of finding an inverted repeat in the 3' spacer of any one gene is approximately  <dig> %. selective placement of specific repeats may extend beyond the rhodophytes and algae with chloroplast genomes of secondary endosymbiotic origin. for example, although rbcs is nuclear-localized in terrestrial plants and green algae, in those cases, the remaining chloroplast-encoded rbcl gene is usually followed by a repeat element in its 3' intergenic region.

the highly conserved association of a secondary element with a specific gene in one taxon may offer clues for its function in others. for example, both strains of h. akashiwo retain a tandem repeat  and an inverted repeat  in the spacer 5' to rpl <dig>  which is the first gene in the putative ribosomal operon. like bacteria  <cit> , chloroplasts  <cit>  transcribe the approximately  <dig> genes within this motif as a single transcript. disruption of the e. coli inverted repeat structure that lies  <dig> bp upstream of the rpl <dig> gene eliminates the transcription of this operon  <cit> . well-documented information is available concerning the impact on terrestrial plant and green algal chloroplast mrna function by the presence of inverted repeats within both the 5' and 3'utr of a gene  <cit> . there is no doubt that intergenic regions contain significant information critical to organelle function. as more chloroplast genome sequences become available, we may find it just as instructive to compare and catalogue these domains, as it is to compare "coding" domains.

CONCLUSIONS
the fosmid-cloning-based chloroplast genome sequencing approach described here allows chloroplast genomic analysis for algal species that would be refractory to conventional organellar dna isolation and analysis. in this study, we have presented new information on the chloroplast genome architecture and function in the stramenopile class raphidophyceae. our ongoing studies target additional underrepresented stramenopile taxa for chloroplast genome analysis. the generated data will help resolve evolutionary patterns and provide insight into the mechanisms of chloroplast genome function within this marginally analyzed taxon.
