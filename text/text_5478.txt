BACKGROUND
secondary metabolites are low-molecular-weight natural products generated by filamentous fungi, plants, algae, bacteria, and animals in response to environmental abiotic and biotic stimuli. secondary metabolites have a strong impact on humankind via their application in health, medicine, agriculture, and industry; they include useful  and detrimental compounds .

filamentous fungi produce a broad range of secondary metabolites. each fungal species can synthesize multiple secondary metabolites, and these metabolites vary from species to species as well thus enabling the use of secondary metabolite profiling in the chemotaxonomy of filamentous fungi  <cit> . the complex network of secondary metabolism is connected to basic  metabolism. secondary metabolites are derived from compounds formed during primary metabolism, e.g. amino acids, nucleotides, carbohydrates, acyl-coa . each secondary metabolic pathway accomplishes its specific function  as part of cellular metabolism and appears to provide "active safety" mechanisms for the producer enhancing survival in the continuously changing environment  <cit> .

aspergillus spp. produce an array of secondary metabolites including aflatoxin, cyclopiazonic acid, aflatrem, patulin, penicillin, kojic acid, lovastatin, carotenoids, and spore pigments; novel secondary metabolites have also been discovered that are synthesized from so called silent gene clusters in a. nidulans, such as terrequinone a, monodictyphenone, emodins, and polyketides  <cit> . fungal-bacterial physical interactions have been shown to induce silent secondary metabolic gene cluster expression in a. nidulans required for biosynthesis of the polyketide orsellinic acid  <cit> .

aflatoxin biosynthesis is one of the most highly characterized secondary metabolic pathways  <cit> . in contrast, pathways for the synthesis of many other secondary metabolites, e.g. patulin, cyclopiazonic acid, aflatrem, and kojic acid, are poorly understood  <cit> . molecular regulation of aflatoxin biosynthesis is complex and involves control of gene expression at the level of the individual gene and at the level of the entire gene cluster  <cit> . biosynthesis of aflatoxin initiates during a transition from exponential growth to stationary phase, and closely correlates with fungal development   <cit> . aflr, a positive aflatoxin pathway regulator, is a transcription factor that controls at least in part expression of several genes in the aflatoxin gene cluster  <cit> . vea, a global regulator of secondary metabolism, links response to light with secondary metabolism and fungal development; this response is mediated through formation of a protein complex velb/vea/laea  <cit> . laea is a nuclear methyl transferase that through protein-protein interactions mediates regulation of secondary metabolism and development  <cit> . aflatoxin biosynthesis is precisely orchestrated within the cell; the early reactions are reported to occur in peroxisomes  <cit> ; recent evidence from our laboratory suggests that specific early steps as well the middle and late steps are carried out in specialized trafficking vesicles, called aflatoxisomes, which are also involved in export of the toxin outside the cell  <cit> . a novel role for vea in coordination of aflatoxisome development with aflatoxin biosynthesis was recently discovered  <cit> . biosynthesis of aflatoxins appears to fulfill multiple biochemical and biological functions including removal of acetate, protection of the genome from uv damage  <cit> , quenching oxidative stress  <cit> , protection from insects  <cit> , and regulation of conidiation, and sclerotia development  <cit> .

in order to manipulate efficiently secondary metabolism  we must understand the "molecular switch" mechanism that controls the initiation of secondary metabolism. reaching this understanding requires a cooperative effort from genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic research. despite advances in knowledge about the genes involved in biosynthesis and the regulation of many secondary metabolitic pathways, a detailed understanding of how secondary metabolism integrates with other metabolic and cellular processes is still not available  <cit> .

metabolomics is a powerful tool to characterize the metabolic state of the cell and to discover new metabolites and biochemical pathways  <cit> . volatiles, one important group of cellular metabolites, represent a significant portion of the metabolome. many organic compounds are present in the volatile phase including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, short chain fatty acids, lipid oxides, terpenes, and phenolics. in this study we applied volatile profiling analysis for gaining rapid access to information on intracellular metabolism in the fungus. specifically, we examined carbon flow in the presence or absence of secondary metabolism in a. parasiticus using wild type and mutant strains carrying genetic defects specifically in aflatoxin biosynthesis and in vea, a global regulator of secondary metabolism. the volatile metabolites generated by the fungus were analyzed using solid phase microextraction - gas chromatography/mass spectrometry . this analytical approach is a non-invasive and solvent-free absorption technique that is used in analysis of volatile compounds from the headspace above the sample  <cit> ; the technique has been widely employed in volatile analysis  of plants, yeast, and bacteria because it is accurate, sensitive, and robust  <cit> . to conduct this procedure, the outer polymer coating of a fused silica fiber absorbs volatiles from the headspace in the growth environment; the volatiles are then desorbed in the hot gc inlet and chromotographed in the usual manner. the separated compounds are subsequently identified by mass spectrometry.

using spme-gc/ms volatile profiling analysis we demonstrated that a genetic block in aflatoxin biosynthesis or disruption of the global regulator vea re-directs intracellular carbon flow. specifically, we observed that vea negatively regulates catabolism of branched chain amino acids and the synthesis of ethanol in a. parasiticus; these metabolic changes were mediated at least in part at the transcriptional level. we also showed that volatile metabolites generated under the control of vea may participate in the molecular machinery that regulates conidiation and sclerotia formation.

RESULTS
profiling of volatile compounds in a. parasiticus su-1
we withdrew samples from cultures at regular intervals during growth and analyzed volatiles following a  <dig> to  <dig> h equilibration period; this sampling method resulted in stable and reproducible measurements. we also analyzed volatile compounds in a control injection that originated from the spme fiber, the glass vial, and the screw cap and valve; these volatiles were excluded from the analysis of volatiles detected in the fungal culture headspace. the relative amounts of volatiles produced in culture were assessed based on instrument response  <cit> ; these compounds were designated as possible, or putative, fungal metabolites since they could be identified by comparison with a mass spectrum library. since the a. parasiticus strains used in the study  did not differ significantly in growth rate in liquid yes medium , the relative intensity change of all masses detected was also related to the levels of the compounds produced in culture. compounds with no match in the nist mass spectrum library were defined as unknown. ethanol levels produced by the fungus in culture were compared to standards. thus, all volatiles detected fell into one of three categories: 1) known compounds identified with standards ; 2) putative compounds identified by a match in nist mass spectrum library; and 3) unknown compounds.

the volatile profile of su- <dig> grown for  <dig> h in liquid yes  in the dark revealed  <dig> putative fungal metabolites and  <dig> unknown compounds . these volatiles could be divided into several classes of chemical compounds. the largest class of putative fungal metabolites included compounds derived from intermediates in metabolism of branched chain amino acids  and esters. additional classes of compounds included alcohols , lipid-derived volatiles , aldehydes , and organic acids . the relative quantities of volatiles derived from metabolism of branched chain amino acids in the dark and light were similar . however, we observed differences in number of leucine- and valine-derived volatiles  that were produced in the light versus dark. the number and relative quantities of branched chain amino acid-derived volatiles detected in the light in yes were higher at  <dig> h as compared with  <dig> h .

we compared volatiles generated by a. parasiticus su- <dig> grown for  <dig> h in the light in gms  to those generated in yes. in gms, the fungus produced a lower number of compounds of all classes of volatiles identified  than in yes .

a genetic block in aflatoxin biosynthesis affects the volatile profile
we compared volatiles produced by a. parasiticus su- <dig>  and a. parasiticus strains impaired in aflatoxin biosynthesis, afs <dig> and  <dig>  grown in a rich medium  for  <dig> h in the dark. aflatoxin synthesis is blocked in afs <dig>  and in a. parasiticus atcc <dig> that carries a mutation in the aflatoxin pathway gene, ver- <dig> . in the dark, afs <dig> and  <dig> generated similar relative quantities of 3-methylbutanal, a presumable intermediate in leucine metabolism, as compared to the wild type strain su- <dig> . however, no 3-methylbutanoic acid ethyl ester was produced by these two mutants . none of the strains studied produced 3-methylbutanol as well.

all studied strains generated 2-methylbutanol, a putative derivative of isoleucine catabolism . nonetheless, the ethyl and methyl esters of the corresponding 2-methylbutanoic acid  were produced by the mutants in less quantity as compared with su- <dig> 

accumulation of 2-methylpropanoic acid ethyl ester, a derivative of valine metabolism, was significantly reduced in afs <dig> and  <dig> as compared to the wild type su- <dig> . all strains, su- <dig>  afs <dig>  and  <dig>  generated 2-methylpropanol.

disruption of vea enhances accumulation of metabolites in branched chain amino acid catabolism
the volatile profile produced by Δvea was significantly different than the profile of su- <dig>  and atcc  <dig> . a. parasiticus Δvea generated significantly higher quantities of metabolites  derived from catabolism of the branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine in the dark and in the light . for instance, quantities of the branched chain alcohols 2-methylbutanol, and 2-methylpropanol were doubled in Δvea. ethyl and methyl esters derived from branched chain amino acids  increased up to  <dig> fold  as compared with su- <dig> and  <dig>  four esters were unique to Δvea . one of these, 2-methylbutanoic acid methyl ester is found in the aroma of gooseberry  <cit> , which may explain the observed fruity smell of Δvea cultures.

interestingly, more than  <dig> fold higher quantities of ethyl acetate and acetic acid were also detected in Δvea  in comparison to  <dig> and su- <dig> 

feeding a. parasiticus Δvea with leucine, isoleucine, and valine
we determined that yes medium contains low levels of 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, and 2-methylpropanal , which serve as precursors to synthesis of the corresponding branched chain alcohols. to examine whether the branched chain alcohols and esters generated in elevated quantities by a. parasiticus Δvea relate to catabolism of the branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine by the fungus, these amino acids were added to  <dig> h old cultures of a. parasiticus Δvea at a final concentration of  <dig>  m and the volatiles were analyzed after  <dig> h. methionine  was added to a separate flask as a control. feeding with leucine increased formation of the esters corresponding to leucine catabolism; however, formation of 3-methylbutanol, an expected product of leucine catabolism, was not detected either with or without addition of leucine . added isoleucine and valine significantly  increased production of the expected corresponding esters and alcohols  . feeding with amino acids also elevated production of certain non-corresponding volatiles. for example, addition of valine increased accumulation of 3-methylbutanoic acid ethyl ester, a product of leucine catabolism. addition of isoleucine and methionine increased formation of the products of valine catabolism including 2-methylpropanoic acid ethyl ester.

disruption of vea increases ethanol production by a. parasiticus Δvea
it was shown previously that aspergilli can produce ethanol  <cit> . in that study, an inverse regulatory relationship between aflatoxin and ethanol accumulation was demonstrated. aflastatin a, an inhibitor of aflatoxin production, was shown to inhibit aflatoxin biosynthesis and concurrently to inhibit ethanol catabolism at the transcriptional level thus resulting in an increase of ethanol accumulation by a. parasiticus; glucose consumption also increased  <cit> .

we demonstrated that in yes, a. parasiticus strains including su- <dig>  b <dig> , afs <dig>  and Δvea produced significantly higher quantities of ethanol than a. nidulans fgsc <dig> at each time point tested  . in the chemically defined medium gms, all a. parasiticus strains tested  generated several fold lower quantities of ethanol as compared with yes medium . light did not influence ethanol production by either strain of a. parasiticus . feeding with leucine  did not significantly affect production of ethanol by the wild type su- <dig> .

a genetic block in aflatoxin biosynthesis in afs <dig> or in  <dig> resulted in a decreased formation of ethanol by these mutant strains in comparison to su- <dig>  however, disruption of vea resulted in  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher levels of ethanol as compared to su- <dig>  or  <dig>  under all conditions tested; the concentration of ethanol in the Δvea culture medium ranged from  <dig> to 8%. feeding with leucine and valine  did not significantly affect production of ethanol by Δvea . however, isoleucine feeding resulted in a slight inhibition of ethanol production .

volatiles produced by a. parasiticus Δvea affect conidiospore and sclerotia formation
disruption of vea results in developmental defects . we previously showed that fungal volatiles play a role in the control of secondary metabolism  <cit> . to test whether the volatiles produced by Δvea participate in the molecular machinery that regulates aflatoxin biosynthesis and asexual conidiation, we grew a. parasiticus b <dig>  on agar medium in the presence of volatiles generated by Δvea. we observed an approximately 35% to 55% reduction in conidiation in b <dig> after exposure to Δvea volatiles for  <dig> days . accumulation of norsolorinic acid was not affected .

to analyze the effect of Δvea volatiles on sclerotia formation, a. parasiticus su- <dig> and atcc  <dig> were grown on coconut or ygt agar media  in the dark in the presence of Δvea volatiles . a. parasiticus su- <dig> grown on coconut agar medium for  <dig> days demonstrated an approximately  <dig> to 40% decrease in the number of sclerotia in the presence of Δvea volatiles . however, no significant effect on the number of sclerotia formed on ygt was observed . under all conditions tested, sclerotia were black in color and were able to produce colonies after harvest followed by inoculation onto yes agar medium. interestingly, su- <dig> conidiospores that developed on coconut medium in the presence of Δvea volatiles for  <dig> days were dark brown, whereas conidiospores developed under su- <dig> volatiles were dark green indicating that volatiles also may affect biosynthesis of conidial pigment.

three  <dig> ×  <dig> mm petri dish lids were placed inside a large  <dig> ×  <dig> mm petri dish as described in methods. for sclerotia development 104spores of a. parasiticus su- <dig> were center inoculated onto one lid that contained coconut agar medium. for volatiles generation, two other lids contained either Δvea inoculated on yes agar medium, or su- <dig> inoculated on coconut agar medium , or su- <dig> inoculated on yes agar medium , or yes agar medium only . the cultures were grown in the dark at 30°c for  <dig> days. the experiment was performed in triplicate. the number of sclerotia developed by su- <dig> grown on coconut agar medium per plate is presented. n\e, not estimated.

analysis of transcript accumulation for branched chain amino acid aminotransferase and alcohol dehydrogenase
the first reaction in the catabolism of branched chain amino acids is catalyzed by a branched chain amino acid aminotransferase that forms a 2-ketoacid; this reaction controls the flow of carbon through the catabolic pathway  <cit> . the resulting 2-ketoacid can then be transformed into a branched chain alcohol , and/or into ethyl or methyl esters . in order to examine possible mechanisms that generate the observed elevation in the accumulation of catabolic products of branched chain amino acids, the expression of branched chain amino acid aminotransferase gene expression was analyzed. the genome of a. flavus, a close relative of a. parasiticus  <cit> , contains two genes  that encode proteins that exhibit a high percentage identity with the saccharomyces cerevesiae branched chain amino acid aminotransferases bat <dig>  and bat <dig> . afla_ <dig> exhibits 61% identity to s. cerevisiae branched chain amino acid aminotransferase bat <dig> and 60% identity to bat <dig> . afla_ <dig> is 43% identical to bat <dig> and 44% identical to bat <dig>  the expression of afla_ <dig> and afla_ <dig> was detected in su- <dig> and  <dig> . interestingly, in Δvea the expression levels for these genes were approximately  <dig> fold higher at  <dig> h as compared with su- <dig> and  <dig> ; at this time point, aflatoxin biosynthesis peaks in su- <dig>  however, there were no significant differences in the relative concentrations of branched amino acids in su- <dig>  Δvea,  <dig>  and afs <dig> cultures grown for  <dig> h in yes .

since we observed a significant increase in the level of ethanol accumulation in Δvea, we analyzed the expression of a gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, afla_ <dig>  this gene exhibits the highest sequence identity  with s. cerevesiae adh <dig>  a gene that encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase . adh <dig> accounts for the majority of alcohol dehydrogenase activity in baker's yeast and primarily is responsible for ethanol formation  <cit> . afla_ <dig> also exhibits  <dig> to 55% identity to the yeast genes adh  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the yeast genes adh <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are also known to participate in the catabolism of amino acids to produce branched chain alcohols  <cit> . in Δvea the expression level for afla_ <dig> was significantly higher at  <dig> h as compared with su- <dig> and  <dig> ; the same pattern of expression was observed for the putative branched chain amino acid transferases afla_ <dig> and afla_ <dig> . these results strongly suggest that vea negatively regulates the formation of branched chain amino acid-derived volatiles and ethanol as the cells trigger secondary metabolism.

vea is a positive regulator of mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation
β-oxidation of fatty acids is one source that supplies precursors for polyketide biosynthesis; in addition, β-oxidation of odd number fatty acids generates propionyl-coa that can affect the activity of a polyketide synthase involved in sterigmatocystin biosynthesis  <cit> , thus presumably contributing to the Δvea phenotype. propionate is also a product of catabolism of several amino acids, including valine and isoleucine. the inability of null mutants Δvea and Δlaea to grow on peanut and maize seeds  <cit>  may be explained by the failure of the mutants to metabolize host lipids due to defects in β-oxidation.

we focused our attention on the genes echa and foxa, which encode, respectively, a short chain enoyl-coa hydratase  involved in β-oxidation in mitochondria, and a multifunctional enzyme foxa  involved in β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids in peroxisomes; these genes previously were shown to be involved in β-oxidation in a. nidulans  <cit> . a blast search using sequences of a. nidulans foxa and echa identified two homologous genes in the genome of a. flavus, a close relative of a. parasiticus  <cit> . afla_ <dig> has 81% identity to a. nidulans foxa; afla_ <dig> has 83% identity to a. nidulans echa. to analyze transcript accumulation in a. parasiticus, primers were designed based on the a. flavus gene sequences .

expression of both genes in the wild type su-1and in Δvea increased from  <dig> h to  <dig> h of growth . by  <dig> h of growth we observed a decline in echa transcript accumulation in su- <dig> and Δvea; however the decrease in Δvea was more severe than in su- <dig>  by  <dig> h of growth, transcript accumulation of foxa in su- <dig> continued to increase, whereas in Δvea accumulation of the foxa transcript declined slightly.

the methylcitrate cycle is one biochemical pathway for propionate metabolism in fungi  <cit> . we hypothesized that impairment of methylcitrate cycle would increase formation of corresponding valine- and leucine-derived esters. we examined transcript accumulation of the first two genes of the methylcitrate cycle, 2-methylcitrate synthase  and 2-methylcitrate dehydratase , in a. parasiticus strains ; we also compared their pattern of accumulation with transcript accumulation of citrate synthase. we detected transcripts for all three genes in all strains tested. however, in Δvea, transcripts for 2-mcs and 2-mcd increased at  <dig> h and declined by  <dig> h, in contrast to the wild type su- <dig>  which showed a slight decrease in transcript accumulation for 2-mcs from  <dig> h to  <dig> h. these data suggest that the 2-methylcitrate cycle is not impaired in Δvea.

discussion
a metabolomics approach previously was used to link complex biochemical and cellular functions to genomics in plants and yeast  <cit> . however, relatively few  metabolomics studies have been reported for filamentous fungi  <cit> . volatile compounds represent a significant portion of the metabolome and, as has been demonstrated in our study, they provide information on the real-time metabolic changes that occur within the fungal cell; most importantly from a practical stand point, this approach does not require quantification of the metabolites or cell disruption. we show that spme-gc/ms is a sensitive, fast, and accurate approach to study changes in volatile compounds generated by the filamentous fungi.

our studies demonstrate that a. parasiticus produces a variety of volatile organic compounds including several classes of intermediates and products associated with catabolism of the branched chain amino acids  and lipids; alcohols, organic acids, esters, and aldehydes were also detected. our data suggest that a. parasiticus catabolizes free branched chain amino acids ; these may either enter the catabolic pathway directly, or they could be used as a carbon source, thus producing detectable levels of metabolic cross talk.

2-ketoacids are also synthesized de novo as late intermediates in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis pathways; they can be converted to the corresponding alcohols and esters. our feeding studies provide evidence that fungal volatile compounds originate from branched chain amino acids catabolism; however, we can not rule out the possibility that 2-ketoacids generated de novo through biosynthetic pathway serve as an additional precursor for volatile synthesis.

we also demonstrate that the number of volatile compounds produced in culture depends on the composition of the growth medium, the presence or absence of light, and also on the status of secondary metabolism in the fungal cell. a genetic block in aflatoxin biosynthesis in afs <dig> and atcc  <dig> resulted in a decrease in formation of isoleucine- and valine-derived acids and esters; intermediates in leucine catabolism  were barely detected. these data support the idea that secondary metabolism  is an integrated part of the cellular metabolism.

our data show that disruption of secondary metabolic pathways in Δvea correlate with dramatic changes in carbon flow through primary metabolic pathways. the most significant metabolic changes were observed in catabolism of branched chain amino acids and formation of ethanol in a. parasiticus; the data strongly suggest that vea acts as a negative regulator of these processes at the transcriptional level. based on previous and current work, we propose a model for the association between secondary metabolism and catabolism of branched chain amino acids and ethanol biosynthesis in a. parasiticus; the model proposes that velvet a plays a key regulatory role in the coordination of carbon flow through these metabolic processes .

how can one explain the changes in carbon flow observed in Δvea? under conditions studied  disruption of vea is thought to impair most if not all of secondary metabolism  <cit> . thus it is reasonable to suggest that the cell must re-structure and re-direct its metabolism and carbon flow in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. an increase in production of ethanol and branched chain alcohols and esters may serve as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cellular redox balance and to promote carbon removal from the cell. our data suggest that, at least at the transcription level, accumulation of acetyl-coa and propionyl-coa in su- <dig> are balanced by channeling through polyketide biosynthesis, the methylcitrate cycle, and ethanol formation. at  <dig> h, the Δvea strain, which is aberrant in secondary metabolism, compensates for the increase in accumulation of propionyl-coa by increasing methylcitrate cycle activity as well as the formation of ethyl-propionate and corresponding esters. acetyl-coa is re-directed through ethanol biosynthesis. the block in secondary metabolism in Δvea, also directs carbon flow through formation of branched chain acyl-coa-derived alcohols, acids and esters. at  <dig> h, these compensatory mechanisms in Δvea likely discontinue resulting in the accumulation of acetyl-coa and propionyl-coa, and in the activation of a feed-back inhibition mechanism that affects β-oxidation both in mitochondria and peroxisomes. in this scenario, vea controls β-oxidation indirectly through accumulation of acetyl-coa and propionyl-coa. however, whether the effect of vea on gene transcription is mediated directly through protein-protein interactions, indirectly through intracellular biochemical changes, or both, remains to be elucidated.

one alternative explanation for the observed changes in carbon flow in Δvea relates to studies on the biosynthesis of polyketide antibiotics by streptomyces spp. the polyketides virginiamycin, tautomycin, mananumycin, butyrolactols, and antraquinones are generated by condensation of starter units including isobutyryl-coa, isovaleryl-coa, and 2-methylbutyryl-coa; the latter are derived from catabolism of the branched chain amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine respectively  <cit> . we propose that aspergillus spp. synthesize polyketide using branched acyl-coa as precursors that originate through catabolism  of branched chain amino acids and or β-oxidation of fatty acids, and that vea positively regulates this biosynthetic pathway. maggio-hall et al.  <cit>  provided evidence that mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of branched chain amino acids utilize the same acyl-coa dehydrogenase encoded by scda. we hypothesize that, in the presence of vea, β-oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of branched chain amino acids occur in mitochondria and provide the necessary starter units for biosynthesis of polyketides, similar to the situation observed in streptomyces spp. in Δvea, the biosynthesis of these polyketide is blocked, which causes a shift in metabolism to stimulate accumulation of branched chain alcohols and branched chain esters . the regulatory feed back mechanisms underlie the decline in β-oxidation of fatty acids. interestingly, valine is synthesized also in the mitochondrion  <cit> . alternatively, a. parasiticus produces other secondary metabolites derived from branched chain amino acids. future work is focused on testing the hypothesis stated above.

vea is a global regulator of morphogenesis and secondary metabolism in aspergillus spp  <cit> ; this gene is involved in transcriptional regulation of several hundred genes  <cit> . our work provides additional mechanistic details about the molecular machinery by which vea regulates gene expression and therefore conidiation and sclerotia formation. we demonstrated that deletion of vea results in accumulation of volatile compounds with biological activity, which in turn, participate in the regulation of developmental processes. what is the role of laea that forms a protein complex with vea in this regulation? future studies are necessary to better understand the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon.

CONCLUSIONS
1) spme-gc/ms volatile profiling analysis is a powerful approach to identify intracellular metabolic changes and the direction of carbon flow in filamentous fungi. an important practical advantage of this approach is that there is no need to calculate individual metabolite concentration or to disrupt the cells. 2) vea coordinates biosynthesis of secondary metabolites with catabolism of branched chain amino acids and alcohol biosynthesis. 3) our work provides insight on how changes in intracellular chemical development are linked to morphological development. 4) understanding carbon flow through secondary metabolic pathways and catabolism of branched chain amino acids is essential for controlling and customizing production of natural products.
