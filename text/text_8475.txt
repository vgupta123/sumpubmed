BACKGROUND
sturgeons  are a very ancient fish group distributed in the palearctic hemisphere with about  <dig> species, most of which are considered to be on the brink of extinction  <cit> . their conservation importance has led to the inclusion of all the species in the red list of the international union for the conservation of nature  and to commercial restrictions under the convention for international trading of endangered species . these fish are also interesting from a biological standpoint, presenting peculiarities that make the characterization of their transcriptome worthwhile. often referred to as living fossils, sturgeons very ancient separation from teleosts occurred over  <dig> mya  <cit> , placing them in a key phylogenetic position for evolutionary studies on vertebrates. a second aspect of interest is related to the ploidy of sturgeons. different species are characterized by different degrees of ploidy which are the result of multiple and independent duplication events  <cit> .

sturgeon species can be divided into two main groups based on their number of chromosomes: the first having approximately  <dig> and the second approximately  <dig> chromosomes. the level of ploidy to be ascribed to each chromosome number is still being debated. some authors consider species of the two groups to be diploid and tetraploid respectively  <cit>  while others attribute the tetra/octoploid condition to the same groups  <cit> . in this paper we characterised the transcriptome of the adriatic sturgeon  which belong to the  <dig> chromosomes group  <cit> . a detailed transcriptome investigation of a polyploid sturgeon species will become crucial to assess the functional reduction of ploidy once the genome will be sequenced or once either the trancriptome of a  <dig> chromosomes species will be available. following a polyploidization event, in fact, the redundant genetic material experiences a functional reduction which can be monitored by analysing the transcribed part of the genome  <cit> .

the high economic value of these animals adds another aspect to the characterisation of the transcriptome of a sturgeon species. sturgeon eggs, sold as caviar, are one of the most valuable products in international food trade  <cit>  and their very high monetary value is the main cause of the extremely-endangered status of most sturgeon species. in response to the rapid decline of natural populations, aquaculture production of caviar is rapidly increasing. one of the main problems for aquaculture caviar producers is that 50% of the animals are profitless males which need to be discarded from production as quickly as possible to minimise expenditure and maximise space. however, sex discrimination in sturgeon farming for caviar production can only be performed by ultrasound analysis after  <dig> or 5 years. the rearing of males can, thus, represent up to 30% of total farming costs  <cit> . a genetic identification of the sexes at an early life stage based on pcr techniques could, therefore, contribute to lowering the costs of caviar production in aquaculture and have knock-on effects in both farming and conservation. aquaculture activity would significantly benefit from this possibility and poaching on natural populations would consequently be reduced.

there are good indications that sex is genetically determined in sturgeon  <cit>  however, genomic screening performed with the aim of identifying a sex marker has not, as yet, yielded satisfactory results  <cit> . knowledge of which genes are involved in sex differentiation in sturgeons is limited and analyses at the transcriptome level of the expressed genes at the first stage at which sex can be histologically determined could contribute to expanding the knowledge base.

in a march  <dig> press release, iucn identified sturgeons as the world's most endangered group of animals with 85% of the species being at risk of extinction. for the very low numbers of wild breeders, future restoration efforts must rely on ex situ conservation strategies through the setup of long-term breeding programs. the availability of a high number of genetic markers to guarantee adequate genetic support to releasing activities, through parental allocation and traceability of the hatchery of origin, become important in this context. moreover, the availability of est-linked markers yielded by transcriptome characterisation may provide a suitable tool for the identification of footprints of selective pressures in the released stocks, due to natural or anthropogenic stress.

the present paper reports the first characterisation of the adriatic sturgeon transcriptome obtained by  <dig> titanium sequencing. we provide the results of the comparison of one male and one female library. finally we characterized microsatellite and snps loci to be employed for conservation purposes.

the results of this characterization have been organized in a public database which represents to our knowledge the first large amount of information of a sturgeon transcriptome.

RESULTS
cleaning and assembly
two one-quarter picotiter plates of a  <dig> flx sequencing run generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads from the a. naccarii male  and female  respectively. fastqc  <cit>  overview of raw sequences showed that mean per-base quality remains above  <dig> for the first 350 bp and, thereafter, drops rapidly towards the end of the reads . the cleaning process was passed by 99% of the reads from each library, yielding a total of  <dig>  mbp of cleaned sequences with an average length of 336 bp and mean phred quality of  <dig>  the main features of the sequences that passed the preprocessing step are summarized in table  <dig> while their length distribution is plotted in additional file  <dig>  the mean gc content calculated for the whole dataset was  <dig> %. gc content across sequence length follows a normal distribution thus discarding the hypothesis that systematic bias was present . as expected, more than 50% of the total sequences  were 400 bp or longer.

the first round of mira assembled  <dig>  reads  into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the first assembly resulted in  <dig>  mbp of total consensus, composed of  <dig>  sequences with an average length of  <dig>  bp, average phred quality of  <dig>  a mean gc content of  <dig> % and an average coverage of  <dig>  reads. more details about the generated contigs and singletons are reported in table  <dig>  in the second round mira reassembled  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singletons  from the previous assembly into  <dig>  metacontigs, with an average coverage of  <dig>  sequence/metacontig .

finally the two assembly runs were merged giving a total of  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  contigs plus metacontigs  and  <dig>  singletons . this resulted in a  <dig> % sequence reduction compared to the first assembly as clearly illustrated by figure  <dig>  overall, the sequences of this final dataset were characterized by a mean length of 466 bp, an average phred quality of  <dig> and a mean coverage of  <dig>  reads. gc content remained the same as in the first assembly . changes in length and quality distribution of contigs from the first to the second round assembly are shown in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> respectively.

we performed the iterative assembly process being aware that some degree of assembly accuracy is lost. in fact, by forcing mira to resolve ambiguous positions by choosing a consensus, the probability of losing rare transcriptional variants is increased. however, two assembly cycles were performed for two reasons: 1) we were interested in having a general overview of genes expressed in a. naccarii by minimizing redundancy, and 2) information on rare variants can be traced back, realigning all the original reads on the corresponding contigs. after assembly, all reads of origin were aligned against belonging contigs and metacontigs, obtaining a multiple alignment for each of them. the distribution of the average coverage observed in the contigs and metacontigs from the first and final assemblies are reported in additional file  <dig>  pair-wise relationships between sequence length, number of reads per contig and average sequence quality after the two assemblies are shown in additional file  <dig>  all contigs and cleaned reads are provided within the anaccariibase database, available at the web page: http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/anaccariibase/. from here on, we will no longer make any distinction between contigs and metacontigs and both will be indicated simply as contigs.

functional annotations
de novo annotation of a. naccarii transcriptome was performed with multi-step procedure starting from similarity search against gender specific nucleotide sequences, main protein and nucleotide databases, full transcribed and protein sequences from other fishes in ensembl database.

blast against sequences available from the genus acipenser
the comparison of a. naccarii sequences with  <dig>  ests for the genus acipenser already available revealed  <dig>  a. naccarii contigs  matching  <dig>  different subjects . the limited percentage of matching sequences can probably be ascribed to the different tissues of origin: gonad and brain in the adriatic sturgeon, and mainly pituitary gland, skin and spleen in the reference database.

blastx against the main protein sequence databases
the comparison of contigs and singletons to the ncbi non-redundant protein database  using blastx, came out with  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons  matching  <dig>  different known or predicted proteins. the taxonomic classification of hits from the nr database, by species, is represented in figure  <dig> 

blastx search in swiss-prot section of the uniprotkb database, identified  <dig>  transcripts  with significant matches against  <dig>  different well-annotated proteins.

blastn against the main nucleotide database
the blastn search against the ncbi nucleotide database  identified significant similarity for  <dig>  transcripts  with  <dig>  different subjects. among sequences with a significant match against nt,  <dig>  had not previously been matched against nr and swiss-prot databases. considering all the blast searches performed so far, a total of  <dig>  ests obtained at least one hit, representing 32% of the adriatic sturgeon transcriptome.

evaluation of the unannotated fraction
a total of  <dig>  non-redundant transcripts remained unannotated after the blast search against the nr database. orf prediction showed that  <dig>  of these sequences  contain a putative open reading frame.

evolutionary comparison with other fishes
the non-redundant contigs of the two a. naccarii libraries were compared to ensembl release  <dig> complete cdna sets for the species of the rs-list.

tblastx and blastx best hit results are collected in tables  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the fraction of a. naccarii transcripts that identify putatively orthologous genes in other fish and humans reflects the phylogenetic distance between a. naccarii and other species. the two non-teleost species on the rs-list, the sea lamprey and the coelacanth, share a higher fraction of genes  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively as also confirmed at the protein level . a possible explanation for this finding is that these two species separated from the ancestor of teleosts before the whole genome duplication  known to have interested the teleost clade  <cit> . part of the newly-formed genetic material is known to have persisted after duplication, possibly evolving new functions and thus becoming unrecognisable by sturgeon ests. this process of gene diversification results in a reduction of the percentage of detectable genes in teleosts. however, a careful analysis of the matching transcripts and proteins should be performed to confirm this hypothesis.

sequences from known-, novel- and pseudo-gene predictions, from ensembl realise  <dig>  were collected for the following species: petromyzon marinus, latimeria chalumnae, danio rerio, gasterosteus aculeatus, oryzias latipes, takifugu rubripes, tetraodon nigroviridis and homo sapiens. a. naccarii transcriptome sequences were searched against each database. for each sequence, the best hit was annotated.

best hits from the alignment of a. naccarii transcriptome sequences against all translations from known-, novel- and pseudo-gene predictions in ensembl realise  <dig> for the different species considered in this work.

in any case, the number of putatively orthologous genes matched by a. naccarii transcripts in other species is expected to be influenced not only by the genetic similarity among species but also by different parameters such as the accuracy of the genome characterisation in the different species used for the comparison and their evolutionary history in which, for example, different mutation rates may play an important role. in fact, different lines of osteichthyes are known to have very different evolutionary rates as a result of different factors such as metabolic features or generation times  <cit> . these differences may deeply affect the number of genes that can be recognized as orthologous among species. zebrafish seems to share fewer genes  with a. naccarii than do other teleosts but, the fraction of the a. naccarii matching ests is comparable to other species. the conclusion is that the danio genome seems to have a higher number of genes. however this could have a different explanation: first, the number of genes is actually higher according to the high level of genes retention after the wgd hypothesized for this species  <cit>  second, more simply, this result is biased by the more complete genome characterization for this model organism.

evaluation of the non-coding rna component
ncrna are implicated in every step of gene expression. to discover and annotate potential non-coding rnas in our transcriptome , we searched for genes corresponding to non-coding rna from genomes of the fish species described above, using blastn. alignment results are collected in table  <dig>  the highest number of alignments was found against mirna sequences from the  <dig> teleosts, in particular in medaka, whose  <dig> mirna were found to be homologous in sturgeon. mitochondrial and ribosomal rna were next in abundance. surprisingly,  <dig> rrna pseudogenes from humans were found to be homologous in a. naccarii. the alignment method used here can underestimate the number of ncrna detected as different types of ncrna have different degrees of sequence conservation between species, with mirna and snorna usually well-conserved while longer-functional ncrna are not  <cit> . moreover, lncrna elements tend to maintain a consensus secondary structure through compensatory base mutations and, therefore, are difficult to detect by sequence alignments alone  <cit> .

all non-coding rna genes and pseudogenes in ensembl realise  <dig> for the different species were searched against a. naccarii transcriptome.

go annotation
we started the go annotation from the blastx results against nr. go terms were retrieved from the association to best-hit for  <dig>   of the overall  <dig>  a. naccarii sequences. protein domains and motif information were retrieved by interproscan via blast2go and corresponding annotations were merged with already existent go terms. a total of  <dig>  contigs provided significant interproscan information, with only  <dig>  of them resulting in go annotation. after merging,  <dig>  unique go terms , were successfully transferred to  <dig>  contigs . as expected, the evidence code distribution shows an over-representation of electronic annotations , although other non-automatic codes, such as inferred from direct assay  and inferred by mutant phenotype , were also well represented .

a. naccarii ests were classified by go-slims within the biological process, molecular function and cellular component domains and a direct acyclic graph  of the ontologies was generated. figure  <dig> shows the number of putative ests annotated with high-level go terms by cutting the dag graph at level  <dig> for each of the  <dig> domains. we also performed enzyme code  annotation through blast2go for sequences with go annotations and retrieved kegg maps for the metabolic pathways in which they participate. in total  <dig>  ests were annotated with  <dig> ecs that identify unique enzymes, participating in  <dig> different pathways . the most populated pathways are “purine metabolism”  with  <dig> enzymes involved, “arginine and proline metabolism”  with  <dig> enzymes and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis  with  <dig> enzymes.

estimation of sequencing completeness
to evaluate the coverage of the cdna libraries by reads, a rarefaction analysis similar to that described in  <cit>  was employed. the extrapolation from the hyperbolic model, fitted onto the average points, obtained by the  <dig> replications of sampling and reference transcript identification, using reads from the male library only, showed that  <dig>  different transcripts were potentially identifiable in the danio cdna set . the  <dig>  different transcripts actually identified using all reads represents 83% of the theoretical maximum. the angular coefficient calculated at final read count was  <dig> . using reads from the female library only, the number of transcripts actually identified was  <dig> , which, compared to the  <dig>  maximum transcripts identifiable at infinite sequencing, represents 83% of the total. the slope at the final read count was  <dig> . finally, putting together reads from both libraries, the model-based extrapolation denoted  <dig>  different transcripts potentially identifiable, and the  <dig>  actually identified represents 88%. the three extrapolated curves are shown in additional file  <dig>  as expected, the slope at maximum read count was  <dig> .

further analysis, exemplified in additional file  <dig>  showed that by changing the reference cdna datasets, the absolute value of the potentially identified transcripts and those actually identified changes, but the ratio between these quantities remains nearly constant. therefore, the latter ratio is a robust value indicating the fraction of the cdna libraries really sequenced.

estimation of transcriptome completeness
to estimate the total number of a. naccarii transcripts potentially present in the two tissues , we adapted the capture-recapture method widely used in ecology to estimate animal population sizes  <cit> . this method requires a precise estimate of the fractions of ests that can be considered common between the male and female libraries . since, before joint assembly, each read was labelled with the library of provenance, final contigs were classified according to the origin of their reads as being cdna3-specific, cdna4-specific or common  <cit> . first, we separated  <dig>  cdna3-specific contigs from the male library  and  <dig>  cdna4-specific contigs from the female library . the direct subtraction between the two groups of library-specific contigs isolated  <dig> contigs showing mutual alignments from each fraction. the indirect subtraction identified  <dig> cdna3-specific and  <dig> cdna4-specific contigs, that aligned on  <dig> common subjects. finally, using ncbi nr as the common database, we identified an additional  <dig> cdna3-specific and  <dig> cdna4-specific contigs which map onto the same  <dig> protein sequences. after all subtractions,  <dig>  cdna3-specific and  <dig>  cdna4-specific contigs remained, that may represent potentially sex-distinctive transcripts.

with the rcapture r package we estimated the transcripts population size to be  <dig>  with a standard error of  <dig>  this means that we have probably sequenced about 80% of the total transcripts in the two tissues of a. naccarii. additional redundancy could still be present in the common contig fraction , which would have increased the estimated total number of transcripts in the tissues of origin. by adopting the capture-recapture approach we are aware that the resulting percentages probably represent an over-estimate of the real fraction of captured transcripts. in fact, the procedures used for the identification of the transcripts common to both libraries may cause some bias due, for example, to a non-correct identification of gene families or to different variants of duplicated genes, especially when dealing with a tetraploid species like a. naccarii. moreover, the assumption that the two fish share the same transcriptomes might be bold because the different genders of the two animals could be responsible not only for different genes directly involved in sex determination but also, for example, for differences in the developmental rate. nevertheless, we think that the approach here proposed, even if indicative when applied to a single comparison, might be very useful for comparative analyses of multiple libraries with the purpose of estimating the relative completeness, especially if obtained by the same sample.

the transcriptome completeness was also evaluated, as noted above, by searching for constitutively-expressed mitochondrial genes. of the  <dig> polypeptide coding genes of the white sturgeon acipenser transmontanus mitochondrial genome,  <dig> were found in our assembly. only the gene for atpase subunit  <dig> was missing. contigs that aligned with these genes showed between  <dig> and 100% identity.

search for sex-determining genes
we evaluated the presence of  <dig> candidate genes known to be involved in sex determination and sexual development in vertebrates by queering the transcriptome with  <dig> collections of orthologs and paralogs for those genes . the first collection represents the largest variety of annotated homologous , from sequenced genomes, categorised in ensembl compara. the second collection is represented by clusters of more specific orthologs, downloaded from ncbi homologene  <cit> . the third group of sequences is a collection of complete or partial cdss from other sturgeon species of the genus acipenser available in ncbi genbank. the use of large collections of putative orthologs and paralogs maximizes the possibility of detecting homologues. in contrast, restricted collections of reliable homologues allow a higher confidence on the match they find. if a contig is confirmed as the best subject for a given gene in searches of all trees, then we can be more confident about its identity.

significant matches were found for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes investigated. the alignments of matching contigs were manually inspected to exclude false-positive matches exclusively due to the presence of widespread protein domains. a complete list of the best matching contigs considered to have a reliable similarity against the  <dig> genes recognised is contained in additional file  <dig>  a similar transcriptomic screening for genes involved in sex differentiation was performed on the lake sturgeon   <cit> . the authors report positive matches for  <dig> genes , all but one included in our search list, the exception being tra- <dig>  all genes were also detected in a. naccarii with the exceptions of dmrt <dig> and wnt <dig>  positive matches with sox genes  were discarded after manual inspection, because the same contigs also matched other sox genes with higher scores. this multiple matching is due to the fact that genes of the sox family often share the conserved high mobility group box domain and assignment based on this domain makes for a less-reliable identification.

the absence of the dmrt <dig> gene from both the a. naccarii libraries is especially interesting and might be due to the incomplete coverage. a second possibility is that this gene is not expressed at the stage at which our samples were collected. in fact, the animals analysed for this project were six months old and were at an early stage of gonad differentiation. this is, to our knowledge, the first stage at which sturgeons, which cannot be sexed visually, have unambiguous evidence of gonad differentiation through fine histological investigation  <cit> . the lake sturgeons analysed by hale and colleagues  <cit>  were estimated to be  <dig> or 14 years old. all characterisations of dmrt <dig> genes from other sturgeon species have been performed on mature or sub-mature animals  <cit> . finally, a low expression of this gene is displayed in the siberian sturgeon with no evident gonad differentiation  <cit> . thus, the absence of dmrt <dig> in the transcriptome of the very young a. naccarii analysed would suggest that this gene is expressed at a later stage of development in this species . dmrt <dig> in known to play an important role as an activator of the genetic cascade of sex differentiation in some other fish, such as medaka  <cit> . even if most of the genes involved in sex determination are known to act in a dosage-dependent manner  <cit> , under the hypothesis that sex differentiation in sturgeon is genetically determined, one could expect that, at the origin of the genetic cascades leading to the different genders, a sex-linked genomic polymorphism occurs. for this reason, special attention was given to the contigs observed to be library-specific. among the  <dig> genes detected, only  <dig> , fhl <dig>  fem1a) and  <dig> , were found to be specific to male  or female  libraries. these genes represent, in our opinion, interesting candidate transcripts for experimental validation by pcr amplification. the remaining fifteen genes were detected by contigs belonging to the common fraction.

discovery of variants
at 90% bayesian probability, we were able to identify  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels. after having filtered out variants beside simple sequence repeats,  <dig>  snps  and  <dig>  indels  were retained from  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs respectively. between contig-containing variants, the average snp per contig was  <dig> , while the mean indels per contig was  <dig> . the mean frequency across all contigs was  <dig> snp every  <dig>  kbp, and  <dig> every 377 bp for the indels. we identified  <dig>  transitions  and  <dig>  transversion , thus confirming that transitions are more common than transversions in our dataset  <cit> .

we then classified snps that fell in predicted coding regions according to the type of mutations: non-synonymous  or synonymous mutations . of the overall contig-containing snps, we were able to identify a putative orf for  <dig>  of them on the basis of the best match against nr database, while for  <dig>  an orf was predicted. of the overall snps found in coding regions,  <dig>  represented non-synonymous mutations while  <dig>  were synonymous. we found that  <dig>  contigs  had ka/ks >  <dig> thus indicating genes putatively under diversifying selection within our samples. on average, we found  <dig>  non-synonymous and  <dig>  synonymous snps per contig in coding regions; this means one non-synonymous mutation every  <dig> kbp of coding portion, and  <dig> synonymous mutation every  <dig>  kbp. distribution of snps and indels across contigs together with distributions of ka/ks are shown in figure  <dig>  we also scanned the entire est set for sample sequence repeats , and we identified  <dig>  ssrs present in simple formation, within a total of  <dig>   contigs. in particular, we found  <dig>  dinucleotides,  <dig>  trinucleotides,  <dig>  tetranucleotides,  <dig> pentanucleotides and  <dig> hexanucleotides. the graph in figure  <dig> shows the frequency of repeat types found accordingly to unit size. of the overall contig-containing ssrs,  <dig>  also contain a putative orf. in total  <dig>  ssrs are predicted within orfs . this availability of a relevant number of est-linked microsatellites and snps represents a precious prerequisite for sturgeon conservation genetics by providing the possibility to monitor the effect of selection on captive and released stocks.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides the first insight into the transcriptome of the adriatic sturgeon, a critically endangered species endemic to the adriatic sea. more generally, this is also the first large release of transcriptomic information for a sturgeon species, shared through a dedicated and searchable database. with over  <dig>  high quality sequences, the information reported represents a significant advance in sturgeon genetics. the apparently limited fraction of successfully annotated sequences with go terms  might be due to the very ancient separation  of sturgeons from any other species for which a relevant genomic information is available. additionally, following the sturgeon-specific whole genome duplications  <cit>  part of the redundant genetic information probably underwent a functional divergence that may have further decreased the fraction of successfully annotable ests. beside the evolutionary interest of a database obtained from a member of the chondrostean, certainly applied genetics studies on sturgeons will benefit from this resource. the present paper also report the results of an investigation on genes related to sex differentiation. out of the  <dig> genes investigated  <dig> were detected in only one of the two libraries suggesting a possible differential expression between genders at this early stage of gonad differentiation. this result might be affected by the limited coverage of our sequencing and should be considered as a starting point for further investigations. interestingly, dmrt <dig>  a master gene for the sex determination known to be expressed in both sexes in different sturgeon species was not detected, suggesting that, differently from other fish species, dmrt <dig> is expressed in sturgeons only in latter stages of maturity. finally, the availability of thousands of est-linked microsatellites makes possible the establishment of a genome-wide genetic markers panel useful to monitor the effect of different selective pressures and to monitor the effects of restocking practices. restocking of most sturgeon species depends on ex situ conservation because of the dramatic decline of natural populations  <cit> . in synthesis, the data provided in the present study and shared through a dedicated website represents the first substantial release of information on a sturgeon transcriptome and will hopefully constitute a useful contribution to sturgeon genetics, aquaculture, and conservation.
