BACKGROUND
alzheimer’s disease is a slowly progressing, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder and the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly. with  <dig>  million new cases every year and a survival time after diagnose of  <dig>  years  <cit>  the number of over  <dig> million people suffering as of  <dig> is thought to be tripled by the year  <dig> according to the world health organization . accompanied by this, the annual cost generated by dementia, currently exceeding  <dig> billion $, will most likely rise to more than  <dig>  billion $ within the next 15 years. it is the socioeconomic impact which lays the foundation for the urgent need of diagnostic and therapeutic tools in ad that target the disease and its progression at an early stage.

histological hallmarks of ad are neurofibrillary tangles, comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau protein  <cit> , and amyloid plaques that are composed of aggregated amyloid-β peptides  <cit> . amyloid-β is regarded as the main culprit causing the neuropathology in ad and is released from the amyloid precursor protein by sequential cleavage with β- and γ-secretases. this processing results in peptides of various amino acids  in length with the majority being  <dig> aa  and  <dig> aa  long  <cit> , hence the terminology aβ40/ <dig>  changes in the metabolism of aβ lead to an imbalance between elevated peptide production and decreased clearance from the brain, shifting the concentration and facilitating self aggregation of β-amyloid. once a critical concentration is surpassed, the aggregation follows a nucleation-dependent polymerization process to form mature fibrils with various oligomeric intermediates along the way  <cit> . a multitude of diverse aβ aggregates has been identified, such as dimers  <cit> , heteromorphous oligomers  <cit> , or protofibrils  <cit> , that represent the last stage before the final transition into the fibril forms. oligomers and protofibrils are widely regarded as the main toxic species in ad although the exact nature of the toxic entity - if such a form even exists  <cit>  - has yet to be elucidated  <cit> .

while on the one side researchers investigating how aβ contributes its toxicity to ad there are still other problems close at hand: up until today it is neither possible to diagnose the disease at an early, presymptomatic stage nor to treat patients beyond symptomatic relief, e.g. alleviating behavioral problems. the first symptoms emerge decades after neuronal changes occur  <cit> . therefore the current diagnoses target progressed characteristics of the disease and are composed of various imaging methods such as x-ray computed tomography  succeeded by magnetic resonance imaging   <cit>  or positron emission tomography   <cit> , additional to cognitive tests and the assessment of the patient’s history regarding the worsening of cognition. still, the combination of these tools does not result in an absolute accuracy of the diagnosis  <cit> . additionally, to modify the progression of alzheimer’s disease it is essential to apply potential therapies at an early stage, long before amyloid plaques are formed  <cit> . current treatment of ad involves acetylcholinesterase inhibitors   <cit>  and n-methyl-d-aspartate  antagonists  <cit>  to improve cognitive functionality, up until now only with remote success. for an early and accurate diagnosis of the disease as well as for a better treatment hypothesis, it is essential to get a deeper insight on the aggregation of amyloid-β.

during the transition from aβ monomer to fibrils, different conformational epitopes are expected to form, which may be used to differentiate between diverse aggregation forms of aβ using antibodies specifically recognizing these conformational epitopes. phage display and immune libraries from macaque have been proven in the past to be an effective instrument for the generation of conformation specific antibodies, already providing a source of binders against targets like ricin  <cit> , anthrax  <cit> , bacterial surface proteins such as crf <dig> from aspergillus fumigatus  <cit> , the venezuelan equine encephalitis virus   <cit>  and the western equine encephalitis virus   <cit>  or botulinum neurotoxin a  <cit> . a further distinct advantage of nhp  derived immune libraries is the very high degree of identity of the antibodies to human antibodies  <cit>  allowing for very easy transition of the scfvs from diagnostic to therapeutic tools. phage display antibody generation further allows to control the conditions and conformations during the very moment of binder selection, offering additional chances to steer antibody specificity towards conformational epitopes  <cit> .

RESULTS
antigen preparation 
fractions of aβ <dig> monomers, protofibrils and mature fibrils were prepared from synthetic aβ <dig> peptide to serve as antigens. depending on the purification method, the separation via sec with one column resulted either solely in pure monomers  or a monomer fraction and a second peak representing a heterogeneous mixture of different sized oligomers, namely protofibrils . these protofibrils range between 15 kda and 500 kda and display various forms and morphologies, with diameters of 8–10 nm and a length of up to 200 nm. protofibrils were further separated by two sec columns connected in series to obtain smaller or larger oligomers . earlier eluting fractions include filaments significantly larger than 200 nm  while later eluting fractions consist predominantly of short fibrils  of up to 100 nm and small, circular aggregates  that can be smaller than 10 nm. mature fibrils are generated from monomers by incubation at 37°c for 24 h and 300 rpm. we observed the same distribution of aggregates among the fractions with two different running buffers: 10 mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig>  or 100 mm na-borate, ph  <dig> . these running buffers were chosen depending on the later purpose of the antigen. aβ <dig> in 10 mm tris buffer cannot be used for amine coupling of the antigen  while aβ <dig> in 10 mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig>  is more suitable for immunization.figure  <dig> generation of aβ <dig> fractions. aβ <dig> peptide was solubilized in 6 m guanidin-hcl  or by dmso, dh2o and tris  and purified by sec.  single column purification of a sole monomer  fraction. fibrils  were derived from monomers by incubation at 37°c,  single column purification of a monomer  and protofibrils  fraction,  purification via two columns connected in series to further separate the protofibrils fraction and obtain large oligomers , medium oligomers  or small oligomers . left: sec chromatograms, right: representative tem images, scale bar corresponds to 200 nm.



immunization and antibody phage display library construction
late fractions of sec purified aβ <dig> oligomers  were used for the immunization as well as for measuring the immune response by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay . ten days after the fifth boost, the antibody titer was determined to be  <dig> per  <dig> . nine weeks later a sixth boost was administered. pcr products of antibody genes were collected six and nine days after the last boost. the dna fragments were pooled and subcloned into pgemt, resulting in a total of  <dig> * <dig> and  <dig> * <dig> individual clones for vh and vl respectively. phal <dig>  a modified version of the phal <dig> phage display vector, was used for phage display library construction by two consecutive cloning steps. first, vl gene fragments for the κ  and λ  were inserted using the restriction sites mlui and noti followed by cloning of the vh gene fragments via sfii and hindiii. the final libraries comprised a total of  <dig> * <dig> individual clones. the insert rates were determined by colony-pcr to be 60% for the kappa library and 80% for the lambda library. both libraries were packaged using m13k <dig> as helperphage.

isolation of amyloid-β specific scfvs
multi-step pannings, with or without competition with unwanted forms of aβ <dig> antigen , were carried out to generate antibodies with diverse specificities against amyloid-β. in addition to the two macaque igg derived immune phage display libraries, two igm derived naïve human phage display libraries hal7/ <dig>  <cit>  were employed. from a total of  <dig> pannings,  <dig> antibody clones were analyzed by elisa and  <dig> hits were identified. eight unique monoclonal antibodies with individual sequences, named pad97-d <dig> from the naïve human libraries and pad172-f <dig>  pad172-f <dig>  pad213-a <dig>  pad218-e <dig>  pad233-e <dig>  pad235-d <dig> and pad236-h <dig> from the immune libraries were selected  based on their specificity, their above average absorption or because of their high signal to noise ratio in the screening elisas. all eight antibodies were produced as scfvs and scfv-fc fusions   <cit>  in mammalian cell culture. pad172-f <dig>  pad218-e <dig> and pad235-d <dig> could not be produced properly and disregarded for the following experiments.table  <dig>

the specificity of pad97-d <dig>  pad172-f <dig>  pad213-a <dig>  pad233-e <dig> and pad236-h <dig> was initially verified on different forms of aβ <dig>  i.e. monomers, small, medium and large oligomers and mature fibrils by elisa . here, all antibodies except pad213-a <dig> showed no predominant binding to any distinct form. only pad213-a <dig> exhibited specificity towards aβ <dig> fibrils. additionally, binding to fibrils of other amyloidogenic peptides was evaluated in the same manner. these peptides included mature fibrils of aβ <dig>  α-synuclein, huntingtin ) and fibrils of tau , the k <dig> domain and the phf <dig> domain of tau. pad97-d <dig> exhibited some cross reactivity with tau fibrils of the isoform f .figure  <dig> specificity determination of scfv-fc antibodies on 100 ng of aβ <dig> monomers , small oligomers , medium oligomers , large oligomers , fibrils  or bsa . dilutions of scfv-fc antibodies were applied and detected using a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human antibody recognizing the fc fragment .



pad213-a <dig> differentiates between various aβ <dig> fibrils
aβ <dig> peptide was purified in two different running buffers, 10 mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig>  or 100 mm na-borate, ph  <dig> , depending on its later application. repeated immunological assays elucidated the selectivity of pad213-a <dig> towards a distinct form of aβ <dig> fibrils. this antibody exhibited no affinity to mature fibrils produced in tris–hcl buffer while on the other hand binding to fibrils generated in na-borate buffer . tem investigation revealed major differences in the composition of the fibrils. na-borate derived fibrils exhibited a compact bundle of 4– <dig> individual fibrils twisted helically every 130–150 nm  while tris derived fibrils consisted of one discrete fibril with a helical twist around its axis about every 50 nm .figure  <dig> pad213-a <dig> discriminates between different aβ <dig> fibrils. a, titration elisa of pad213-a <dig> on different kinds of aβ <dig> fibrils. plates were coated with 100 ng of aβ <dig> fibrils from 100 mm na-borate, ph  <dig>   or 10 mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig>  . bound scfv-fc antibodies were detected using a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human antibody recognizing the fc fragment . right: representative tem images of aβ <dig> fibrils obtained from monomers purified in  100 mm na-borate, ph  <dig>  or  10 mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig> , the scale bar corresponds to 200 nm.



all antibodies detect different epitopes
the determination of the epitope of the amyloid-β specific antibodies was performed using a peptide spot membrane . each spot on the membrane consisted of  <dig> aa of the aβ <dig> peptide with an offset of  <dig> aa. epitope mapping was performed with all antibodies to verify binding to linear epitopes. no binding was detected with pad213-a <dig> since it is fibril specific, i.e. detecting a conformational epitope. pad97-d <dig>  pad172-f <dig> and pad236-h <dig> bound to the n-terminus of aβ <dig> albeit differing in the exact epitope with position  <dig> to  <dig> for pad97-d <dig> , position  <dig> to  <dig> for pad172-f <dig>  and position  <dig> to  <dig> for pad236-h <dig> . a more precise determination of the epitopes for these three antibodies was impeded by the spot sizes of  <dig> aa in length. pad233-e <dig> bound to the central region of aβ <dig>  here, the exact epitope was more narrowly determined by amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  .figure  <dig> epitope mapping analysis. left: membranes covering the complete sequence of aβ <dig> with peptides of  <dig> amino acids in length and an offset of  <dig> amino acid. 10 μg/ml of scfv-fc antibodies were used for staining, antibodies were detected using a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human antibody recognizing the fc fragment  pad213-a <dig> not shown . right: peptide spot map.



affinity determination of the scfvs by surface plasmon resonance 
affinity determination was carried out on various amyloid-β monomers, protofibrils and fibrils, via biacore™ with different antibody concentrations and resulted in kd values in the micro- to nanomolar range . the antibodies targeting the aminoterminal end of aβ <dig> and each antibody, pad97-d <dig>  pad172-f <dig> and pad236-h <dig>  exhibited similar affinities towards all three forms of antigen. in contrast, pad233-e <dig> which binds to the core region of aβ <dig> shows an 100-fold elevated affinity to aβ <dig> monomers, with a kd of  <dig> nm, when compared to protofibrils and fibrils. pad213-a <dig> bound solely to aβ <dig> fibrils with a kd of 36 μm.table  <dig>

yumabs inhibit aβ <dig> fibrillogenesis in a concentration dependent manner
when binding to aβ <dig> monomers, an inhibitory effect of the antibodies on fibril formation could be possible. we tested the effect of all antibodies on the formation of mature aβ <dig> fibrils from pure monomers by visualizing potential fibrils using transmission electron microscopy  and measuring thioflavin t  fluorescence. tht is a dye that, upon binding to amyloid fibrils, exhibits fluorescence. thus it allows for the assessment of fibril formation, which was investigated in this study by combining part of the sample with tht stock solution every six hours during the first 24 h, every 12 h during the next 24 h and with a final checkpoint after 96 h .figure  <dig> influence of scfv-fc antibodies  on aβ <dig> fibrillogenesis. left: 5 μm aβ <dig> monomers were incubated with 2 μm , 1 μm ,  <dig>  μm  or 0 μm  of scfv-fc antibodies at 37°c under constant agitation of 300 rpm, tht fluorescence was monitored over a time course of 96 h. all measurements were carried out in triplicates, the error bars represent the respective standard deviation. right: representative tem images of the fibrils formed from of 5 μm aβ <dig> monomer after 96 h incubation in the presence of 2 μm scfv-fc antibody, scale bar corresponds to 400 nm.



bivalent scfv-fc antibodies  were able to interfere with fibril formation at a substoichiometric level for pad97-d <dig>  pad233-e <dig> and pad236-h <dig> . the influence is most notable for pad233-e <dig>  the antibody targeting the central α-helical region of aβ <dig>  addition of 4 μm scfv-fc antibody to 5 μm aβ <dig> monomers resulted in a reduction in tht fluorescence of about 25% for pad97-d <dig>  nearly 50% for pad236-h <dig> and even more elevated forpad233-e <dig> after 96 h of incubation . comparison with pad213-a <dig> or the negative control scfv-fc antibody indicates that this effect is not contributed to antibody concentration or design. interestingly, pad172-f <dig>  also directed against the n-terminal end of aβ <dig> like pad97-d <dig> and pad236-h <dig>  did not show an inhibitory effect.

the reverse mechanism, a disintegration of preformed fibrils by antibody addition, was evaluated by tht reading and tem analysis as well. no antibody mediated disintegration of mature fibrils .

discussion
aβ <dig> oligomers were chosen for the immunization of the nhp due to their reported elevated toxicity, making them a potential target for immunotherapy. using the immune libraries and two previously established human naïve libraries  <cit>  in a multistep panning, we created numerous antibody fragments specific for β-amyloid with an interesting spectrum of different binding properties.

the initial validation utilizing titration elisas demonstrated antibody specificity towards either form of aβ <dig> aggregates but no predominant preference for pad97-d <dig>  pad172-f <dig>  pad233-e <dig> or pad236-h <dig>  epitope mapping further revealed that three of these four antibodies detect the n-terminal part of aβ <dig> whereas pad233-e <dig> binds to the central region. this is consistent with previous findings that the amino-terminal region of aβ <dig> is immunodominant in human  <cit> , nhp  <cit>  as well as in dog  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and rabbit  <cit>  explaining the quantity of antibodies and antibody fragments directed against this part of the peptide in this work and previous studies  <cit> , with bapineuzumab being the most prominent one. solely pad213-a <dig> demonstrated a high selectivity towards aβ <dig> fibrils and did not bind to any other form of aβ <dig>  remarkably, pad213-a <dig> was able to even discriminate between two different aβ <dig> fibril preparations, depending whether the amyloid-β peptide was purified in  <dig> mm tris–hcl/ph  <dig>  or in  <dig> mm na-borate/ph  <dig> .

meinhardt et al.  <cit>  already described other preparation dependent polymorphisms in aβ <dig> fibrils. based on their findings, it seems likely that the difference in the acidity of the buffers contributes to a morphological change in the fibril structure, a hypothesis that is supported by our tem analysis. it can be hypothesized that pad213-a <dig> distinguishes between both types of fibrils through the detection of a conformational epitope which may well be dependent on the helical twist angle or the interspace distances between two single strands that make up the mature β-amyloid fibril. while there are antibodies and polyclonal sera that are fibril specific  <cit>  the specificity observed here was not reported for any other known antibody. it remains to evaluated whether these structural differences have any significance in vivo.

to investigate the antibodies for a potential application as disease modulators, we assessed their impact on the fibrillization of aβ <dig> monomers in vitro. the fibrillogenesis of aβ <dig> is a nucleation-dependent polymerization process  <cit> . when a certain concentration threshold of monomers is surpassed small aggregates termed “nuclei” accrue and polymerization starts. these nuclei are elongated by addition of monomers forming larger aggregates and ultimately fibrils. it has been previously shown that antibodies targeting the n-terminal end of amyloid-β exhibit an inhibitory effect on the fibrillogenesis  <cit> . with the majority of our antibodies recognizing aβ <dig> monomers this gives rise to the idea that they can intervene in the initial aggregation by preventing interactions of β-amyloid peptides thus retarding or even inhibiting fibril formation  <cit> .

pad97-d <dig> and pad236-h <dig> demonstrate a concentration dependent retardation of fibril formation resulting in shorter fibrils and an overall stronger appearance of unstructured aggregates. they do not prevent fibrillization entirely, which suggests a steric hindrance during monomer-monomer attachment  <cit> . albeit also binding to the amino-terminal region of aβ <dig>  pad172-f <dig> exhibited no substantial effect on fibril formation. with no major discrepancies in the affinity compared to pad97-d <dig> or pad236-h <dig>  this result is likely to be accounted to the minute differences in epitopes. it is plausible that pad172-f <dig> attaches to monomers in such way that no steric hindrance is administered towards the core region of aβ <dig>  a partial masking of that area by an antibody would minimize monomer-monomer interaction and impede fibril formation. epitope mapping demonstrates that pad97-d <dig> binds aβ1– <dig> while pad172-f <dig> and pad236-h <dig> bound further downstream . obviously, pad97-d <dig>  pad172-f <dig> and pad236-h <dig> attach to the monomer with different spatial arrangements. further, the region of the epitope on the aβ <dig> peptide may contribute to the similar kd values to different aggregates measured for these antibodies. pad97-d <dig>  pad172-f <dig> and pad236-h <dig> bind to the amino-terminal end of the β-amyloid peptide, an epitope that is exposed in monomers and aggregates during fibrillogenesis  <cit> . this may allow nearly equal affinities of the before mentioned antibodies to all three forms.

pad233-e <dig> impacts fibril formation, which is not surprising as it targets the central region of aβ <dig> with aβ17– <dig> , a part of the hydrophobic core element  that is essential for β-sheet formation during fibrillization  <cit> . together with the elevated affinity towards aβ <dig> monomers, this effect can be accounted to two probable modes of action or a mixture of both. pad233-e <dig> either masks the lvff-motif thus directly preventing monomer-monomer interaction. this effect was postulated by legleiter et al. for the antibody m <dig>  the murine progenitor of solanezumab  <cit> . m <dig> targets the same epitope as pad233-e <dig>  binding to aβ16– <dig>   <cit>  and prevents the formation of fibrils and even protofibrils. the other possible explanation is the attachment of pad233-e <dig> to aβ <dig> monomers thus shifting the concentration threshold of soluble β-amyloid beneath the critical limit necessary for the polymerization process. interestingly, pad233-e <dig> has a much more pronounced influence on amyloid-β fibrillogenesis than any other antibody as visualized by tem. yet the tht absorbance after 96 h is similar to that of pad236-h <dig> which might be an indication for the formation of smaller aggregates with a β-sheet rich content. this would suggest the latter mode of action described for pad233-e <dig> to be more dominant in the inhibition process.

the impact on ad immunotherapy of the antibodies presented in this work has to be further validated. recently, bapineuzumab  and solanezumab , both not conformation specific antibodies, failed to meet the expected endpoints in clinical phase  <dig> studies albeit having shown positive results in preceding studies . the results of the initial characterization for the yumabs in this work are promising. especially pad213-a <dig> exhibits a highly interesting property of differentiating between aβ <dig> fibrils based on their conformation that is not yet described in literature and its implication on ad diagnosis and therapy has to be further validated with in vivo data.

CONCLUSIONS
among the investigated antibody fragments we found three scfvs exhibiting a general specificity towards β-amyloid while two scfvs, pad213-a <dig> and pad233-e <dig>  presented a tendency to better bind to certain forms of aβ <dig>  pad213-a <dig> is highly specific for mature aβ <dig> fibrils and identified a novel structural variation in fibrillar structures. pad233-e <dig>  albeit binding also oligomers and fibrils, showed a 100fold increased affinity towards monomers. it is also one of the three antibodies exhibiting an inhibitory effect on the fibrillization of aβ <dig> monomers.

while the in vivo relevance of these differences is still to be established, the study confirms that the approach of animal immunization and subsequent phage display based antibody selection is applicable to generate highly specific anti β-amyloid scfvs that are capable of accurately discriminating between minute conformational differences.
