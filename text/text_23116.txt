BACKGROUND
in shrimp aquaculture, much interest has been shown for biofloc technology . bft is a rearing system with little or no water exchange. in such a system, a conglomerate of microbes, algae and protozoa develops in the water column, along with detritus and dead organic particles  <cit> . the resulting intensive microbial community can serve as a pond water quality treatment system, whilst the microbial protein produced can be used as feed. the current problem with bft is the difficulty of controlling the biofloc bacterial community composition for both optimal water quality and optimal shrimp health. today, the research priority for bft is to measure and describe the complex microbial biofloc community and to develop methods that will establish diverse and stable microbial communities. few authors have quantified total heterotrophic bacteria and vibrio sp.  <cit> . zhao et al.  <cit>  reported that adding bacillus into bft water resulted in a decrease in vibrio abundance. however, to the best of our knowledge, no author has yet characterized the totality of the bacterial communities in a bft system.

it is assumed by many authors that, by consuming natural productivity, shrimps ingest the bacteria present on the particles  <cit> . it is also known that the composition of aquatic bacterial communities in ponds has a strong influence on the internal bacterial microbiota of farmed marine animals; this can play a role in nutrition, immunity, and disease resistance of animals  <cit> . however, no study has examined the potential relationship between bft bacteria and those of cultured animals.

today, biofloc technology is used throughout the world. two great advantages of bft are that the intensive microbial community present can serve as a pond water quality treatment system whilst the microbial protein can be used as a nutrient. however, very little information is available on the bacterial communities present in the rearing water or on the interaction of this microbial environment with bacteria of the shrimp microbiota. an important step for the improvement and optimization of biofloc technology is the characterization and control of its microbial community. in this study, we characterized microbial communities of water samples obtained from different shrimp culture environments  as well as from the intestines of shrimp reared in both environments using miseq illumina sequencing technique, and evaluated the impact of the culture environment on shrimp microbiota.

RESULTS
bacterial diversity and composition in bft and cw rearing water
a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequences were obtained for rearing-water with an average of  <dig>  reads per sample . sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units  at the  <dig>  similarity level. the greengenes 13_ <dig> reference otu collection bank was used as reference. otu richness of water varied from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  per sample in the cw treatment to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the bft treatment.

to compare the bacterial diversity between treatments, shannon and simpson indices were calculated from the otus. the shannon index varied from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the cw treatment to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the bft treatment. the simpson index varied from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the cw treatment to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the bft treatment. the similarity in these indices suggested a similar range of diversity between the treatments. it is important to note that the simpson index, which was close to  <dig>  revealed a high species diversity.

although the bacterial diversity was similar, the frequency distribution of bacterial phyla differed between the treatments . proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in water from both treatments. in this study, its relative abundance ranged between  <dig>  % for cw and  <dig>  % for bft. this phylum is widely dispersed in the marine environment and plays an important role in the process of nutrient cycling and the mineralization of organic compounds  <cit> . bacteroidetes was the second most abundant phylum, with a relative abundance ranging from  <dig>  % for cw and  <dig>  % for bft. this phylum is a dominant member of marine heterotrophic bacterioplankton and is frequently found colonizing macroscopic organic matter particles  <cit> . finally, cyanobacteria was the third most abundant phylum, with a relative abundance ranging from  <dig>  % for cw to  <dig>  % for bft. altogether, these three phyla represented more than 90 % of the total bacteria.table  <dig> relative abundance of the most frequently identified bacterial phyla  in water from different rearing conditions: clear water  and biofloc

in bft water, leucothrix , rhodobacteraceae , stramenopiles , oceanospirillaceae  and saprospiraceae  were the most dominant operational taxonomic units. in the cw conditions, cryomorphaceae , pelagibacteraceae , stramenopiles , glaciecola  and colwelliaceae  were the most represented taxa.

a high level of variability in the most frequent bacterial communities was evidenced over the course of bft rearing  that could be due to changes in biotic and abiotic environmental factors  <cit> . in the bft system, several physicochemical and biological parameters such as chlorophyll a , nitrite nitrogen  and total ammonia nitrogen  changed over time, whereas these parameters were stable and close to zero in the cw system . in the bft system, a classic sequence of nitrogen species was observed as described by  <cit> : when a zero exchange water tank is stocked and fed, processes start that lead to an ammonium build up in the water. when ammonium concentration rises, the ammonium oxidizing bacteria population starts to develop and oxidize the evolved ammonium, leading to the lowering of nh4+-n concentration. at this point, nitrite oxidizing bacteria start to develop. during this transition period, nitrite concentration in the water rises. then, when there are enough bacteria, they control both the ammonium and nitrite concentrations. ph values were relatively stable over time . a correlation was detected between the evolution of the major bacterial groups found in bft water and three environmental parameters of rearing  using spearman’s test. the frequency distribution of leucotrix increased with the time, peaking at the last rearing day at  <dig>  % of the total bacteria. this genus is considered to be comprised of bacteria capable of filamentous growth  <cit> . its evolution was positively correlated with nitrite concentration . nitrite could be used as a growth source by this genus. moreover, this genus needs to be attached to survive. in bft, the high concentration of biofloc particles in the water column can serve as mounting surfaces . moreover, leucotrix mucor, the most studied species in this genus, was found to obtain its nutrients for growth from algae rather than from seawater  <cit> . it is therefore logical that its evolution is significantly correlated with chl a concentration . however, leucotrix mucor is known to cause fouling disease in shrimps, although it is not considered to be a true pathogen  <cit> . the family oceanospirillaceae representing  <dig>  % before the beginning of the experiment, decreased significantly after 2 days of rearing . the genus that displayed the greatest change after the beginning of the experiment was marinomonas. the abrupt change could be attributed to the large increase in shrimp biomass between the start of the experiment and the point at which the biofloc was well developed. quantities of bacteroidetes saprospiraceae, bacteria found only in bft water, were positively correlated with nh4+-n concentration . this taxon can easily use the organic substrate  <cit> . rhodobacteraceae, found at a high frequency in the bft water, is frequently detected in aquaculture biofilm systems  <cit> . it is considered an excellent biofilm-forming organism and is among the first and dominant colonizers of the surface in all marine environments  <cit> . the ability to effectively colonize surfaces gives rhodobacteraceae a competitive advantage in the bft, where total suspended solid concentration is important. in addition, the rhodobacteraceae family is known to exhibit a diverse range of metabolic activity. the rhodobacter group can possibly establish an antagonistic beneficial bacterial community in the rearing environment of turbot larva and thereby limit the survival of pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . in our study, rhodobacteraceae may therefore have played an important role in maintaining the health of the culture system. indeed, the vibrionales order represented 6 % of total sequence in cw conditions , whereas it represented only  <dig>  % in bft conditions . vibrio, belonging to the vibrionaceae family, has been characterized as pathogens for some aquatic organisms including crustacean larvae and juveniles . because vibrio is less abundant in bft , shrimps could be less exposed to vibrioses. in the cw treatment,  <dig>  % of the total vibrionaceae sequence was represented by photobacterium damselae. this species is known to be a marine fish pathogen that can be transmitted to fish through water  <cit> . it seems that bft limited the proliferation of this species and could thus minimize the risk of infection. in this study, the rhodobacteraceae family could have limited the survival of pathogenic bacteria in the bft compared with the cw environment. another suggestion to explain the lower vibrio abundance in bft is that bioflocs displayed biocontrol activity against vibrio harveyi, the virulence of which can be regulated by the process of cell-to-cell communication called quorum sensing  <cit> .fig.  <dig> changes in relative abundance of the five main taxa over the course of rearing in bft

in this work, the cw environment harbored communities of bacterial genera that were distinct from those found in the bft environment. indeed, results from similarity percentages revealed that profiles of water samples from each treatment were distinct, with 89 % dissimilarity. similarity percentage analysis  showed that the genera photobacterium, leucothrix and vibrio were the three principal taxa at the root of the dissimilarity  between water samples from the two treatments. among the most represented taxa found in cw environment, pelagibacteraceae is already known to constitute a family of extreme oligotrophs that are widely distributed across the earth’s oceans  <cit> . moreover, alteromonadacea, cryomorphaceae and pelagibacteraceae families were considered the most abundant bacterial groups in the eastern mediterranean sea, which is an ultraoligotrophic marine habitat  <cit> . their significant presence in the cw water can be explained by the fact that water was pumped directly from the lagoon of tahiti , which is also oligotrophic seawater. in the cw tank, water renewal was very high ; it is therefore logical that the bacterial communities in the tank reflect those of the lagoon.

based on these observations, we can explain the difference in bacterial communities between the bft and cw environments by the high levels of organic matter and nutrient concentrations present in biofloc. the biofloc treatment was characterized by bacteria belonging to taxa such as gammaproteobacteria thiotrichaceae leucothrix, alphaproteobacteria rhodobacteraceae and bacteroidetes saprospiraceae. these bacteria have the particularity of using organic matter and nitrogen compounds for growth and require a support to grow on. these two conditions are found in the bft system, which is particularly rich in organic matter and suspended particles in the water column. this ability to attach to the surfaces and to use organic matter may be a significant physiological characteristic of bacteria in biofloc. in contrast, the bacterial groups found in the cw system, mainly alteromonadaceae, cryomorphaceae and pelagibacteraceae families, are characteristics of oligotrophic waters.

effect of rearing environment on shrimp microbiota
in aquatic ecosystems, the close relationships between microorganisms and other biota and the constant flow of water through the digestive tract of fish and invertebrates will also affect their indigenous microflora  <cit> . in this study, we focused on the bacterial distribution and composition in shrimp intestine after 35 days of rearing according to different conditions, cw or bft.

a total of  <dig>  sequences were obtained for intestine samples, with an average of  <dig>  reads per cw sample  and  <dig>  reads per bft sample . the otu richness of intestine samples varied from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  per sample in the cw treatment to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the bft treatment. the relative abundance of major order bacteria in the intestine samples from both types of growing conditions is presented in table  <dig>  it should be remembered that the shrimps had not eaten any commercial feed for 24 h before sampling. bft and cw libraries from intestine samples were mostly dominated by one order affiliated to gammaproteobacteria vibrionales. this order is better represented in intestines from cw-reared shrimps  than those from bft-reared shrimps . this group of bacteria has previously been reported at high relative abundance in the intestines of other species of shrimps such as litopenaeus vannamei, peneaus monodon and fenneropenaeus chinensis . alphaproteobacteria rhodobacterales was the second most abundant order, with a relative abundance ranging from  <dig>  % for cw and  <dig>  % for bft. chloroplast stramenopiles only represented a small fraction of the sequences, but showed a difference between the treatments:  <dig>  % in cw shrimp intestines, but less than 2 % in bft shrimp intestines. flavobacteriia flavobacteriales and bacteroidia bacteroidales orders belonging to the bacteroidetes, and mollicutes orders belonging to the phylum tenericutes represented  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, in bft shrimp intestines, while these orders represented less than 2 % in cw shrimp intestines.table  <dig> relative abundance of the most frequently identified bacterial orders  within shrimp intestines from two different types of rearing conditions: clear water  or biofloc

the pseudoalteromonadaceae family represented  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in the shrimp intestines from the cw and bft treatments, respectively. the vibrionaceae family represented  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in shrimp intestine from the cw and bft treatments, respectively. photobacterium represented  <dig> to 89 % of vibrionaceae in the total sequence from all the shrimp intestines, while vibrio accounted for the remainder.

the shannon index varied from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the cw treatment to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the bft treatment, and the simpson index varied from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the cw treatment to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the bft treatment. these comparable indices suggested a similar range of diversity in the two treatments. however, compared with indices measured in water, bacterial diversity estimated by the shannon index, in which a higher value means greater bacterial diversity, revealed a significantly lower diversity in the intestine compared to water . similarly, the simpson index, for which a lower value means a greater bacterial diversity, confirmed this result . johnson et al.  <cit>  showed that water had substantially more diverse microflora than the intestine of shrimps. they expected this because the environment of the shrimp gut is different from water in an aquaculture tank and not all microbes in the water would be ingested and survive in the gut. moreover, shrimp gut is less aerobic than tank water and has immunological factors which may differentially select against some bacteria.

bacterial otus in rearing water and shrimp intestine were investigated with regard to treatment and are shown quantitatively in the venn diagram in fig.  <dig>  the analyses revealed that  <dig> otus were shared between all sample types, which corresponds to  <dig>  % of the total otus. the diagram clearly emphasizes that water samples have a large pool of otus that are not found in the intestines , which contrasts with the low number of otus found exclusively in intestine . this result confirmed that the flora found in water is substantially more diverse than that of shrimp guts.fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing the unique and shared otus  in the different libraries: bft and cw intestines, bft and cw water



significant differences in the bacterial communities of intestines and water from cw and bft treatments were visualized by the multidimensional scale  plot, and confirmed using analysis of similarity   . a stress value below  <dig>   indicates that an mds ordination plot is a good spatial representation of the difference in the data. anosim analysis takes into account the difference of bacterial taxa  and their relative abundance, in contrast to a venn diagram, which only compares the number of bacterial otus between the different growing conditions. in this figure, bacterial communities in cw intestines reflected the outside cw environment after one month of rearing. moreover, shrimp intestines from bft had bacterial communities distinct from those in cw.fig.  <dig> non-metric multidimensional scaling  plot using the bray-curtis coefficient of sequencing results associated with intestines and water samples from cw or bft treatments after 35 days of rearing. each point represents a sequencing profile from one sample



previous investigations have proposed that the intestinal microbiota of shrimp originate from their cultural environment  <cit> . in the present study, profiles of intestinal bacterial communities from each treatment were distinct . moreover, results of the mds analysis showed that the composition of bacterial communities in shrimp intestines from the cw treatment was relatively similar to those of the rearing environment. similarity percentage analysis  revealed 35 % similarity between cw water and intestine samples. however, this was not the case for the bft treatment, as similarity percentage analysis revealed only 13 % similarity between water and intestine samples. according to the simper analysis, cryomorphaceae sp., photobacterium damselae and pelagibacteraceae were the three principal taxa at the root of dissimilarity  between the intestine samples from both treatments. interestingly, these taxa were found at a greater frequency in the cw intestine and its corresponding water compared to bft intestine and its corresponding water, confirming the influence of the bacterial composition of the water environment on that of the intestine. leucothrix and rhodobacteraceae contributed  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, to the dissimilarity. conversely, these group abundances were greater in bft intestines and water than in cw intestines and water. these results also suggest that the bacterial composition of bft water influenced that of the intestine. nonetheless, bft intestine bacteria had specificities different from those of cw intestine. indeed, the mds plot revealed differences in bacterial specificity between bft intestine and bft water, whereas for the cw treatment, intestine bacteria communities reflected those of rearing water more closely.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study explored the diversity of bacterial communities by applying 16s rna next-generation sequencing to different culture environments  and intestines of shrimp reared in both environments. the results demonstrated, first, that the water harbored a remarkable diversity of bacterial communities and that four out of the five most important bacterial communities were different between culture methods. second, this study showed that the culture environment interacted with the intestinal microbial communities. this swork provides descriptive information about a bacterial community associated with biofloc rearing, and its influence on shrimp intestinal microbiota, which can further be applied to research on immunity, disease resistance and nutrition of shrimp in aquaculture.
