BACKGROUND
classical laboratory inbred strains of mice offer the most valuable model system for medical research, allowing for instance the analysis of complex traits. however, laboratory strains were derived from a limited number of founding mice that belonged to several mus musculus subspecies: mus m. domesticus, mus m. musculus, m. m. castaneus and the hybrid m. m. molossinus  <cit> . therefore, their genetic variation does not encompass the diversity seen in mice trapped in many geographical areas in the wild. to overcome this lack of polymorphism, strains that belong to different species of the mus genus have recently been established from wild progenitors. among these emerges the short-tailed species mus spretus, a western mediterranean mouse, that splitted from mus musculus around  <dig>  million years ago  <cit> . although they are sympatric, these species rarely generate hybrids in nature. under laboratory conditions, they produce viable and fertile offspring with a large number of polymorphisms of natural origin, but male offspring are sterile. strains of mus spretus are frequently utilized in combination with mus musculus strains for quantitative trait loci  studies, due to their high degree of sequence and phenotypic diversity  <cit> . indeed, mus spretus mice have been valuable for the identification of loci contributing to differences in immune response  <cit>  and were used to generate the first high-density genetic map for the mouse  <cit> .

any inbred strain derived from mus spretus exhibits on average a snp  in every  <dig> base pairs when compared with any of the classical laboratory strain. by comparison, the frequency of snps between humans is roughly one order of magnitude lower. however, a comparison study between the brain proteomes of mus musculus and mus spretus  <cit>  revealed a considerable discrepancy between the frequency of qualitative protein polymorphisms detected by 2-de  and the frequency predicted on the basis of snps . the protein polymorphism between mouse species has been analyzed from different tissues  <cit> . milk protein polymorphism plays an important role in genetic diversity analysis and phylogenetic studies. in addition, it contributes to improve our understanding of mammary evolution and of the role and sustainable use of genetic variation in farm animals. to our knowledge, although mice can be a pertinent model system for the identification of candidate genes for qtl of milk production traits in cattle  <cit> , no proteomic studies have been carried out so far to analyse the diversity of mouse milk proteins and their polymorphism across mus species.

in this report, we compared the major milk proteins between seg/pas and c57bl/6j strains. seg/pas was derived from mus spretus, while c57bl/6j is a reference laboratory strain belonging to the mus musculus species. the majority of the genome sequence data available for mus spretus are from spret/ei, while the seg/pas genome sequence data are limited and even absent concerning the major milk protein encoding genes.

in our study, polymorphisms occurring in major milk proteins between c57bl/6j and seg/pas were analyzed and characterized. we used both proteomic and genomic approaches to highlight differences between both strains. interestingly, three of the main milk proteins showed structural differences, with allelic variation and some flexibility in splicing patterns of primary transcripts arising from the corresponding genes.

methods
mice
mice from the c57bl/6j and seg/pas inbred strains were housed at the inra  and institut pasteur  research centers, respectively. milk samples were collected during the first part of lactation, i.e. at day   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from parturition, and the second part of lactation . females were separated  <dig> hours before milking, injected with  <dig>  u synthetic oxytocin  and then anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection  of a solution containing  <dig> ml imalgène  <dig> ,  <dig>  ml rompun  in a final volume of  <dig> ml water. after milking, the collected milk samples were diluted with water in a 1: <dig>  ratio, skimmed by centrifugation  and stored at -80°c. animal care and experimentations were in accordance with guidelines of the international guiding principles for biomedical research.

rp-hplc analysis
protein concentration of milks was determined using a bradford assay  <cit> . clarified skimmed milk samples were analysed by rp-hplc as previously described  <cit> . chromatographic peaks were collected and dried in a vacuum system.

sds-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis
pooled chromatographic fractions corresponding to each peak were subsequently separated by sds-page as previously described  <cit> . proteins  from skimmed milk collected on day  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of lactation were also analyzed by  <dig> % sds-page mini-gels.

2d-gel electrophoresis analysis
milks were further characterized by 2d electrophoresis. skimmed milk samples containing  <dig> μg of proteins were diluted in a rehydration solution containing urea/thiourea , chaps , dtt  <dig> mm, ipg ph 4- <dig> carrier ampholytes  and a trace of bromophenol blue to obtain a final volume of  <dig> μl. the rehydration step was performed in active mode  on 24-cm immobiline drystrip ph 4- <dig> for  <dig> hours in a protean ief cell . afterwards, isoelectric focusing  was run by increasing progressively the voltage to reach a plateau at  <dig> kv and a total applied voltage of  <dig> kvh in  <dig> hours. the focused proteins were successively reduced , and alkylated  and the strips equilibrated in a solution of  <dig> m urea, 2% sds,  <dig>  m tris ph  <dig>  and 30% glycerol. the strips were then loaded on the top of home-cast linear  <dig> % polyacrylamide gels  and were embedded in a solution of 1% of agarose. sds-page were performed in an ettan dalt six electrophoresis unit  at  <dig> ma/gel for  <dig> min,  <dig> ma/gel for  <dig> min and finally at  <dig>  w/gel until the front of migration reached the bottom of the gels. proteins were stained with biosafe coomassie blue  and the gels were imaged on a labimager .

maldi-tof mass spectrometry
protein bands or spots from 1-d or 2-d gels were excised and the proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin. tryptic peptides were analysed on a voyager de-str maldi-tof mass spectrometer . peptides co-crystallized with α-chca matrix , were desorbed and ionized with a nitrogen laser at  <dig> nm in the positive ion mode and delayed extraction. spectra were internally calibrated using both trypsin autolysis peaks  in data explorer software . after deisotoping, the peptide mass lists were searched against the swissprot  <dig> and uniprot  <dig> databases with the ms-fit protein prospector software .

ltq-orbitrap mass spectrometry
hplc fractions corresponding to the whey acidic protein  were solubilized in an acetonitrile/water/formic acid 50/49/ <dig>  solution. the sample solution was infused at a flow rate of  <dig> μl/min in an electrospray source of a ltq-orbitrap xl . proteins were ionized with a spray voltage of  <dig> kv and a temperature of  <dig> °c. spectra were averaged for  <dig> min and deconvoluted with maxent algorithm.

rna extraction and rt-pcr
mammary glands from milked animals killed by cervical dislocation were dissected. the mammary tissue was collected from c57bl/6j and seg/pas lactating mice. total rna was extracted from the mammary tissue samples using rnalater  according to the manufacturer's instructions. rna quantity, quality and purity were analyzed as previously described  <cit> . rna were mixed with  <dig> μl of 2/ <dig> random primers  and 1/ <dig> oligo  <dig>  to a final volume of  <dig> μl. synthesis of the first complementary dna strand was performed with reverse transcriptase   according to the manufacturer's guidelines. briefly, cdna synthesis was carried out at 50°c for  <dig> min. rt was inactivated at 70°c for  <dig> min. in order to remove rna complementary to the first cdna strand,  <dig> units of e. coli rnaseh were added. finally, the mix was incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min.

pcr amplification of cdna, subcloning and sequencing
primers were designed to amplify the cdna from csn1s <dig>  csn <dig> and wap transcripts . the primers were purchased from mwg biotech . pcr products were analyzed by electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide  in agarose gel in tris/borate/edta buffer. the pcr products for wap and csn <dig> were directly sequenced using primer pairs used for pcr. the pcr products yielded for csn1s <dig> were cloned in pcr®4-topo® plasmid vector  and transformed into top <dig> e. coli cells according to the protocol supplied in the kit for sequencing . clones were tested by pcr, using m <dig> reverse and forward primers, and recombinant plasmids were sequenced from both strands by gatc biotech .

RESULTS
analysis of the milk protein fraction at mid-lactation
the protein concentration of milks collected on the 10th day of lactation from seg/pas and c57bl/6j mice differed significantly :  <dig> ±  <dig> g/l vs.  <dig> ±  <dig> g/l, respectively , being almost four times lower for seg/pas than for c57bl/6j.

the rp-hplc method previously described  <cit>  allowing protein polymorphism detection in mus musculus strains was applied to compare the major protein fraction of seg/pas and c57bl/6j milks. elution profiles of the main milk proteins thus obtained are given in figure  <dig>  the protein content of each peak was subsequently analyzed by sds-page and protein bands extracted from the gel were identified through peptide-mass finger printing , using a maldi-tof mass spectrometer. depending on the mouse strain, β- and αs1-caseins as well as wap exhibited different retention times.

to assess that the chromatographic retention time differences are real and not due to experimental artifact, milk samples were first analyzed in duplicate. identical elution patterns were recurrently obtained with the same sample and with several individual milks, at the same stage of lactation. β-casein and wap from seg/pas were eluted earlier than those from c57bl/6j. two isoforms of αs1-casein were observed, as previously described  <cit> . however, they showed a longer retention time in seg/pas than those from c57bl/6j.

to further confirm and characterize such a protein polymorphism, milk samples from c57bl/6j and seg/pas were subsequently analysed by 2-de . the main spots were identified by maldi-tof mass spectrometry. αs1-, β- and γ-caseins, as well as α-lactalbumin and serum albumin displayed several spots in the gels. conversely, wap was present as a single spot. the major milk proteins were all identified, except κ-casein, probably because this glycosylated protein has a pi below  <dig>  which was the lower limit of the ief strip used here. in seg/pas, wap showed a different electrophoretic mobility, with a lower apparent pi and a higher molecular mass, compared to c57bl/6j. relative proportions of αs1-casein isoforms were also species-dependent. in 2d gels, the minor αs1-casein isoforms appeared to be in higher amount in seg/pas, whereas the major αs1-casein isoform was less abundant compared to c57bl/6j. this result was in accordance with the chromatographic pattern shown in figure  <dig>  finally, 2-de analysis allowed highlighting α-lactalbumin, which was not detected in our chromatographic analysis conditions.

evolution of major milk proteins over the lactation period
to test whether the overall major protein composition varies over the lactation period in milk from seg/pas and c57bl/6j, milk was collected from females at day   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> after parturition. skimmed milks were analysed in sds-page. mono dimensional electrophoresis patterns of proteins  at d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> displayed no visual differences within strains, except for κ-casein. in the seg/pas strain, at day  <dig>  κ-casein appeared as a diffused band, between  <dig> and  <dig> kda. this κ-casein form declined progressively, whereas a sharper band  became predominant during the second part of lactation . by contrast, as far as c57bl/6j milk is concerned, κ-casein appeared as a more resolved and intense band at ca.  <dig> kda, whatever the stage of lactation and topped by a smear of which the intensity increases with the lactation stage.

csn1s <dig> polymorphism
to characterize csn1s <dig> polymorphism, mrnas encoding αs1-casein were isolated from seg/pas and c57bl/6j mammary glands, reverse transcribed, amplified, and cloned. clones showing inserts of different sizes were selected and sequenced. four csn1s <dig> cdnas were found in each species. figure  <dig> shows the transcripts identified in seg/pas and c57bl/6j tissues together with the intron/exon structure organization of the mouse csn1s <dig> gene. full-length nucleotide sequences of the seg/pas and c57bl/6j csn1s <dig> mrna were determined . alignment of seg/pas and c57bl/6j csn1s <dig> cdna sequences showed  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the 3'utr and  <dig> snps in the coding region; five of them correspond to amino acid substitutions  in the seg/pas strain. three internally deleted transcripts were identified from c57bl/6j mammary gland. they corresponded to:  cryptic splice site usages occurring within exon  <dig> , leading to the deletion of its first codon , and within exon  <dig> of which  <dig> nucleotides are lost during the course of the primary transcript processing; : skipping of exons  <dig> and 10;  skipping of exon  <dig> . likewise, two internally deleted transcripts were also identified in seg/pas mammary gland, due to the same cryptic splice site usages, leading to  the loss of  <dig> nucleotides in exon 21;  deletion of the first codon  in exon  <dig> and exon-skipping events affecting exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  an additional transcript, longer than the proper mrna, was also identified. this isoform results from insertion of  <dig> nucleotides from the 3' end of intron  <dig>  none of these deletions or insertion shifted the reading frame, but the putative proteins encoded by these differentially spliced transcripts differ by their molecular weights and potential phosphorylation sites .

comparison of the main structural features of the mouse αs1-casein isoforms deduced from the transcripts sequences found in c57bl/6j and seg/pas mouse strains. number of amino acids , molecular weight , isoelectric point , and number of potential phosphorylation sites  of the different mouse αs1-casein isoforms found in the c57bl/6j and seg/pas mouse strains. the αs1-casein isoforms a, b, c, a', b', c' refer to the sequences of the corresponding matured transcripts .

altogether, these data reveal a "loud" polymorphism in the csn1s <dig> transcripts in both c57bl/6j and seg/pas strains, giving rise to a large diversity of expression products.

csn <dig> polymorphism
similarly, csn <dig> transcripts encoding β-casein were isolated from the mammary gland of seg/pas and c57bl/6j mice, reverse-transcribed to cdna which were amplified and sequenced. alignment of c57bl/6j and seg/pas csn <dig> cdna sequences  revealed the existence of  <dig> snps in the 3'utr and  <dig> snps in the coding region, six leading to amino acid substitutions in the seg/pas polypeptide chain , all occurring in exon  <dig> . moreover, one additional transcript, showing a deletion of the first cag codon, encoding a glutaminyl residue  in exon  <dig>  was identified in both strains.

wap gene polymorphism
given the difference in electrophoresis mobility, the polymorphism of the wap gene was also investigated. c57bl/6j cdna encoding wap sequenced in this work is identical to the reference mrna sequence available in databases . on the other hand, as shown in figure  <dig>  the comparison with seg/pas cdna  highlights  <dig> snps in the ca.  <dig> nucleotide fragment that was sequenced. six of them are located in the coding region while  <dig> are in the 3'utr. three snps are responsible for amino acid substitutions: k36e, t94a and m99k. in addition, a  <dig> nucleotide deletion occurring in the seg/pas sequence was shown to lead to the loss of a serine residue at position  <dig> .

the predicted molecular weights  of c57bl/6j and seg/pas waps deduced from nucleotide sequences are  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig> da, respectively . such a weak difference , due to amino acid substitution and deletion cannot account for the retarded electrophoretic mobility observed with seg/pas wap in mono  and 2d electrophoresis . even though there is no evidence for post translational modifications of murine wap in the literature, this result suggested that post translational modifications might occur in seg/pas wap. to test this hypothesis, the chromatographic fractions corresponding to wap from c57bl/6j and from seg/pas were collected and analysed on ltq-orbitrap mass spectrometer. native masses were  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig> da, for c57bl/6j and seg/pas, respectively. the difference between experimental and theoretical masses for wap from c57bl/6j and seg/pas is  <dig>  and  <dig>  da, respectively. this mass corresponds to the formation of a pyroglutamic residue at the n-terminal position. in addition, the mass difference recorded between seg/pas and c57bl/6j waps  is identical to the difference  between predicted molecular weights. therefore, no evidence for post-translational modifications of the wap from seg/pas was detected.

discussion
several technical approaches, including gel electrophoresis, rp-hplc, mass spectrometry, cdna cloning and sequencing, allowed to get a detailed description of the milk protein fraction across two mouse strains belonging to the mus spretus or mus musculus species. in this manner, we first observed that the protein content of mus spretus milk is by far very low compared with that of c57bl/6j. in addition, we identified several polymorphisms differentiating these two species, as well as so far undescribed casein splice variants.

the protein content varies across mouse species
piletz and ganschow  <cit> , in a comprehensive study, have already reported that the milk protein concentration in fifty inbred strains of mice belonging to the mus musculus species ranges between  <dig> g/l  and  <dig>  g/l . such a strain effect, affecting more generally the concentration of all milk components, was also observed across five mus musculus strains  <cit> , however to a less exent . more recently, riley et al. showed that the protein concentrations in qs5i and cba milk are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l, respectively  <cit> . here, we show that the protein concentration in the milk of seg/pas mice was four folds lower compared with c57bl/6j mice and therefore similar to the protein concentration previously reported in pwk/pas mus m. musculus milk   <cit> . thus, two strains recently introduced in animal facilities and belonging to mus spretus and mus m. musculus, display a much lower milk protein concentration by comparison with the classical mus m. domesticus subspecies. therefore, the milk protein concentration greatly varies between mouse species but also within mouse species and between strains. the range of variation between mice is quite of the same order with that observed in phylogenetically distant species, since the concentration of milk proteins may account for more than  <dig> g/l in some lagomorph species, whereas in human milk, it does not exceed  <dig> g/l  <cit> .

in distinct mouse strains, the composition of major milk proteins varies over the lactation period
within species only κ-casein showed evolution in electrophoresis pattern during the course of lactation, likely corresponding to changes in the level of post-translational modifications . during the early stages of lactation, the seg/pas κ-casein gave rise to an indistinct band in sds-page suggesting some heterogeneity in the glycosylation level of the protein, as reported in qsi <dig> and cba mus musculus strains  <cit> . this pattern progressively disappeared, to finally give rise to a discrete band of a lower apparent molecular weight. this is indicative of a less glycosylated form of κ-casein in the second part of lactation. by contrast, from the beginning of lactation the less glycosylated form of c57bl/6j κ-casein was highly expressed compared with the other strains. in addition, we observed that expression of ε-casein increased from the early stages of lactation to reach a stabilized level at mid lactation , as reported by riley et al.  <cit> . consistent with this, rudolph et al observed low levels of ε-casein mrna between days  <dig> and  <dig>  in contrast with the expression of most milk protein genes  <cit> .

protein polymorphisms distinguish mus spretus and mus m. domesticus milk
of the nine major proteins from mouse milk three only, namely αs1-casein, β-casein and wap, showed obvious variations in electrophoretic mobility and/or chromatographic retention time between seg/pas and c57bl/6j, reflecting variation in charge, hydrophobicity and molecular weight. sequencing cdnas encoding csn1s <dig>  csn <dig> and wap in both mouse species revealed differential splicing patterns and snps in coding sequences, of which some were responsible for amino acid substitutions. most of the splicing variants, observed with casein mrnas, were shared by both c57bl/6j and seg/pas. on the other hand, snps inducing amino acid substitutions are the most discriminating features to distinguish seg/pas from c57bl/6j.

a polymorphism in the wap encoding gene was suspected between c57bl/6j and seg/pas from chromatographic as well as 2d- and 1d-electrophoresis gel behaviour. indeed, the wap variant in seg/pas is remarkably slowed and ran as a smearing spot at a molecular weight higher than expected from its amino acid sequence. from the wap transcripts sequences, proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric points  are predicted: mw:  <dig> .61/pi:  <dig>  and mw:  <dig> .57/pi:  <dig>  for the c57bl/6j and seg/pas waps, respectively. the  <dig>  da difference in molecular weight cannot account for the dramatic difference in mobility of the variants on sds-page gels, whereas the horizontal shift observed in 2d electrophoresis agrees with the  <dig>  difference in isoelectric points. genetic polymorphisms across mouse strains have been previously reported for the wap gene. indeed, wap-a and wap-b are used to ascribe c57bl/6j and ybr variants, respectively  <cit> . the protein variant encoded by wap-b has one cysteine less and one arginine more than the wap-a variant. comparison of c57bl/6j and seg/pas wap cdna sequences revealed mutations associated with  <dig> amino acid substitutions  and one amino acid deletion . interestingly, the deletion of s <dig> together with t94a and m99k substitutions provide a domain ii peptide sequence which is closer to the rat wap than to the c57bl/6j wap  <cit> . likewise, k36e substitution, located within domain i, leads to an acidic residue  that is conserved in most species, except for the mus musculus strains. elsewhere, we found that the kspt  insertion in the c-terminus part of the rat protein is due to incorporation of an intron sequence at the splice site junction between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  since these mutations in the seg/pas wap are not located in the four disulfide core  domains containing the conserved cysteine residues, it is likely that they have small effects, if any, on the three-dimensional structure of the protein. amino acid sequence of mouse waps does not highlight any potential site for post-translational modifications, in contrast to pig wap which, from molecular weight considerations, appears to be glycosylated  <cit> . neither wap-a, nor the seg/pas wap stained positively with the periodic acidic-schiff , suggesting that they are not glycosylated. moreover, orbitrap mass spectrometer data confirmed the absence of post-translational modifications in wap from both strains. thus the shift observed in 1d and 2d electrophoresis gels between c57bl/6j and seg/pas seems not to result from molecular mass alterations, but rather reflects changes in protein conformation that may affect the constant sds/protein ratio or the shape of the sds-protein complex. indeed, numerous studies aimed at testing the sensitivity of electrophoresis in detecting protein polymorphisms have shown that protein migration in sds gels is often depending on their shape which in turn varies with their conformation  <cit> . wap displays a lipoprotein-like structure, although the amount of lipid associated with wap is heterogeneous  <cit> . therefore, our hypothesis is that the amount of associated lipid is higher in seg/pas wap than in wap-a, thus impairing the expected migration.

the wap gene was also sequenced from strains 129/svj  <cit>  and gr  belonging to mus musculus species. wap from 129/svj is identical to the c57bl/6j wap-a. by contrast, wap from gr differs from wap-a by three amino acid substitutions , the first one being located in the signal peptide. thus, at least three wap variants exist within the mus musculus species and one in mus spretus . following the nomenclature used by hennighausen and sippel  <cit> , we propose to name waps from gr and seg/pas wap-c and d, respectively.

the frequency of snps in the coding region of wap cdna from seg/pas and c57bl/6j was estimated to  <dig> %. this frequency was only  <dig> % within the coding region of wap from c57bl/6j and gr that belong to the same mus musculus species.

a comparison of c57bl/6j nucleotide sequences published for β- and αs1-caseins with the c3h/hen and fvb/n mice strains sequences, respectively, did not reveal any genetic polymorphism. by contrast, sequencing data provided here for c57bl/6j and seg/pas αs1- and β-caseins cdna clearly show the existence of snps in the coding regions, leading to 5/ <dig> amino acid substitutions, as well as in the 3'utrs.

comparisons of coding and non coding  orthologous milk protein genes in mus musculus and mus spretus indicate that, on average, mus spretus exhibits one snp in every  <dig> to  <dig> bp and  <dig> to  <dig> bp, respectively. we found that snps occur at higher frequencies in non-coding  than in coding  sequences in csn1s <dig>  csn <dig> and wap genes. these results agree with previous data indicating that snps occur at higher frequencies in non coding  than in coding  regions in mus spretus  <cit> . however, the snp frequencies in milk protein genes reach twice the values reported at the whole genome level. comparing c57bl/6j and seg/pas, others have also estimated the polymorphism rate at the whole genome level to range between  <dig> and 2%  <cit> .

therefore, selection pressure seems to be lower on milk protein genes than on the rest of the genome. however, highly conserved hydrophobic domains and multiple phosphorylation sites, identified both in αs1- and β-caseins, are less subjected to mutations, confirming functional constraints acting to conserve the overall architecture of the corresponding molecules. likewise, despite a significant rate of polymorphism between c57bl/6j and seg/pas, no mutations were detected in the wap 4-dsc domains that are essential for its structure and function.

αs1-casein molecular diversity is mainly due to post transcriptional modifications
rp-hplc analyses were indicative of the existence of several αs1-casein isoforms and polymorphisms, since αs1-caseins from c57bl/6j and seg/pas milks show different retention times. in a previous study  <cit> , we reported that the minor and the major isoforms of αs1-casein exhibited different chromatographic elution behaviour between milk from c57bl/6j and pwk/pas mice. indeed, comparison of chromatographic profiles from c57bl/6j, seg/pas and pwk/pas, revealed that the two αs1-casein isoforms from c57bl/6j had a shorter retention time than the isoforms from pwk/pas and seg/pas milks. despite they belong to different species, αs1-casein isoforms from pwk/pas and seg/pas show a similar chromatographic elution pattern.

since tryptic peptide masses that allow the identification of αs1-casein in both fractions did not distinguish between isoforms, native masses of proteins contained in each chromatographic fraction of αs1-casein were measured using maldi-tof mass spectrometry . we obtained several masses ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  da which correspond to αs1-casein. however, it was not possible to assign the different isoforms identified from cdna sequencing to the molecular weights obtained, within each fraction. this result suggests the existence of additional isoforms including different phosphorylation levels. such a hypothesis is consistent with the electrophoresis  patterns of αs1-casein chromatographic fractions which were shown to contain at least two bands, either with c57bl/6j or seg/pas milks . bands from minor fractions migrate faster than those present in the major fractions, thus suggesting that the former contains the shortest variants , whereas the major fraction contains the full-length protein  together with protein variants arising from c  or c' mrna isoforms. moreover, the partial deletion of exon  <dig> in isoforms a  and a'  should strongly modify its chromatographic behaviour since the 19-aa deleted segment encodes a number of hydrophobic residues, including  <dig> phenylalanyl ,  <dig> isoleucyl  and  <dig> alanyl  residues. this large deletion is due to the usage of a cryptic splice site occurring in exon  <dig>   <dig> nucleotides downstream from an ag defining the proper end of intron  <dig>  in frame and following a rather strong polypyrimidine tract  although interrupted by a triplet of contiguous g. the same deletion was also reported in the αs1-casein from the mouse fvb/n strain . even though such an event seems to be relatively rare, a casual improper splicing using an exon cryptic splice site and leading to the loss of  <dig> aa residues was also reported in the equine csn <dig> mrna  <cit> . on the other hand, the loss of a cag, induced by an error-prone junction sequence, is much more frequent. this defect in accuracy was observed both with β-casein  and for the first time in αs1-casein . it leads casually to the loss of a glutaminyl residue  promoted by the nucleotide sequence at the junction between intron  <dig> and exon  <dig> for csn1s <dig> mrnas and between intron  <dig> and exon  <dig> for csn <dig> mrnas. the mechanism by which ag defining the 3' splice site is accurately and efficiently recognized involves a 5' to 3' scanning process  <cit> . the first ag downstream of the branch point-polypyrimidine tract is selected preferentially. however, the occurrence of competitive ag, downstream from the proximal one, can alternatively trigger its usage. the occurrence of a tandem cag triplet codon at an intron-exon junction would be a facilitating feature. the casual deletion of the cag codon was first detected in casein-coding genes in goat  <cit> , and later in ovine  <cit> , bovine and water buffalo  <cit> . such a splice-acceptor site slippage was also reported in the human αs1-casein  <cit> . examples of insertion/deletion of q are well documented and occur in all calcium-sensitive casein pre-mrnas, as well as in a number of other proteins in mice and humans such as abcg <dig>  <cit> , igf- <dig> receptor  <cit>  and pax <dig>  <cit> . more generally, alternative splicing at short-distance tandem site is widespread in many species  <cit> .

the insertion of  <dig> nucleotides upstream of exon  <dig> in csn1s <dig> seg/pas is likely due to the usage of a cryptic splice site. since the relevant genomic sequence of mus spretus is not available yet, it is difficult to sustain such an hypothesis. however, there is an imperfect polypyrimidine tract containing several purine bases in the genomic sequence of mus musculus, upstream from the 3' acceptor cryptic splice site.

additionally, several αs1-casein isoforms identified in c57bl/6j and seg/pas as splicing variants arise from "clean" skipping of exon sequences. these isoforms originated from skipping events during the processing of the primary transcripts. the phenomenon has been reported in small ruminants  <cit>  and in humans  <cit> . regarding exons  <dig> and  <dig> which are alternatively skipped, "en bloc" from the c57bl/6j mrnas, this could be explained, as far as exon  <dig> is concerned, by weakness in the consensus sequence at the 3' acceptor splice site of intron  <dig>  however, there is no obvious explanation for exon  <dig> skipping. likewise, in seg/pas, two exons  were simultaneously deleted. since genomic sequences are not available for mus spretus, it is difficult to explain why this kind of event may have occurred. exon  <dig> , which is skipped in c57bl/6j, is located in a chromosomal region where major rearrangements have been reported in the mouse genome . this is also the region where one can posit that exon  <dig> in cattle  might have resulted from the "exonisation" of a  <dig> nucleotides intronic region located between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  from comparison of orthologous csn1s <dig> genes between several species. in mouse csn1s <dig>  there is a tandem repeat of  <dig> copies of a  <dig> nucleotides exon . multiple alignments of genomic sequences spanning the first to the third exon copy suggest that this structure results from a first duplication event that involved exon  <dig> and a part of the downstream intron . later, a subsequent tandem duplication of this basic motif might have occurred seven times. this exon  <dig> which is present in humans  <cit>  camel, horse, guinea-pig and pig  <cit>  is also present in bovine  <cit> . it was shown to correspond to a short "virtual exon" occurring within intron  <dig> and surrounded by quite perfect consensus splice sequences, except the 5' donor splice site which is absent in the bovine genome.

about  <dig> different genetic variants are expressed from the  <dig> main bovine milk protein loci  and considerable differences in allele frequencies were observed among breeds. the situation is still much more complex in less selected ruminants such as goats in which ca.  <dig> alleles have been found at csn1s <dig> and csn <dig> loci  <cit> . however, comparative analysis of the casein gene cluster genomic sequences across species shows that the organization and orientation of the genes is highly conserved. the conserved gene structure indicates that the molecular diversity of caseins is primarily achieved through variable species-specific use of exons  and high evolutionary divergence. caseins are the most divergent of the milk proteins with an average pairwise percent identity ranging between  <dig> and 55% across placental mammals  <cit> .

by contrast to the rapid evolution of casein genes previously put forth  <cit> , milk protein genes in general seemed to evolve more slowly than others in the bovine genome, despite selective breeding for milk production. the most conserved genes were those for proteins of the milk fat globule membrane, suggesting that the mechanism for milk-fat secretion is essential. diversity in milk composition could not be explained by diversity of the encoded milk proteins and although gene duplication may contribute to species variation, this is not a major determinant  <cit> . thus, other regulatory mechanisms must be involved. for example, on the basis of analysis of the opossum genome, mikkelsen et al  <cit>  concluded that most of the genomic diversity between marsupials and placental mammals comes from non-coding sequences, arising from sequence inserted by transposable elements.

sharp et al.  <cit>  proposed models for evolution of the wap gene in the mammalian lineage either through exon loss from an ancient ancestor or by rapid evolution via exon shuffling, whereas a functional wap gene has been lost in humans, cattle and goats.

the question remains however to know whether polymorphisms of milk proteins is larger between mice inbred strains than between breeds of ruminants for example?

CONCLUSIONS
of the nine mouse milk major proteins, only three showed variations in chromatographic retention time  or electrophoretic mobility  between mice species.

considering the high frequency of snps between c57bl/6j and seg/pas, most of the other major milk proteins might be also affected by single amino acid polymorphisms . our hypothesis is that most of the saps have no consequences on the structural properties of proteins, and therefore result in "silent" polymorphism not detected by electrophoresis or chromatographic methods used.

our results also revealed different known alternative splicing mechanisms giving rise to a large diversity of proteins of different molecular weights, isoelectric points and hydrophobicities within each mouse strains.
