BACKGROUND
amyloids are proteins that can form fibrils - highly ordered aggregates of a characteristic zipper structure  <cit> . majority of these proteins natively have a completely different functional structure in their physiological state, although functional amyloids also exist  <cit> . a hypothesis holds that in vivo amyloidogenic regions are usually capped by gatekeeper aminoacids, like prolines and glycines, which prevent aggregation, and may have a high affinity to chaperone proteins  <cit> . very often amyloids lead to serious diseases, like alzheimer disease , parkinson disease , type  <dig> diabetes , creutzfeldt-jakob disease , huntington disease , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , etc. . the number of diseases that turn out amyloid-associated is constantly increasing. it is believed that their toxicity is related to insertion of non-mature aggregates into plasma membranes as non-selective ion channels.

recently, it was discovered that amyloidogenic properties can be due to short segments of aminoacids in a protein sequence , which can transform the structure when non-burried  <cit> . it was proposed that hexapeptides can sufficiently represent such hot-spots, although they may vary between 4– <dig> aminoacids. a few hundreds of such peptides have been experimentally found, however testing all combinations is not possible. instead, they can be predicted by computational methods.

several physico-chemical methods have been proposed to predict amylogenicity of a peptide, e.g. tango  <cit> , zipperdb  <cit> , pasta  <cit> , aggrescan  <cit> , preamyl  <cit> , zyggregator  <cit> , camfold  <cit> , netcssp  <cit> , foldamyloid  <cit> , amyloidmutant  <cit> , betascan  <cit> , and consensus amylpred  <cit> . the majority of these methods predict probability of a sequence to form β-aggregates. as it turned out, such an approach was not always successful. although β-aggregation is related to amyloidosis, structural and biophysical properties are different  <cit> . β-aggregation is quite common in highly concentrated proteins, which do not form fibers. on the other hand, certain amyloids, like prions, are poorly predicted by tools dedicated to β-aggregates.

methods like 3d profile, applied in zipperdb or amyloidmutant, which take into account more specific structural features of amyloids - resembling a steric zipper  <cit>  - work better in such cases. also statistical elements seem to help in the classification, as shown in waltz  <cit>  using position specific scoring matrices , or bayesian classifier and weighted decision tree applied to long sequences of bacterial antibodies  <cit> .

experimental datasets, upon which new classification methods could be built, are still very limited. those sequences that show amyloid propensity are rarely well characterized. for the majority of them, it is not known which segment is responsible for their amylogenicity and few of them have an experimental structure of high resolution  <cit> . the biggest database of potential hexapeptides, generated with the 3d profile method, comes from the zipperdb. the classical 3d profile method applies over  <dig>  thousand scaffolds resembling a steric zipper structure, on which tested hexapeptides are threaded, and their minimal energy is calculated. if the minimal energy of one chain is below a threshold value, which could be obtained from experimental dataset of hexapeptides, then the hexapeptide is classified as amyloidogenic. the method is reasonable and quite accurate - the authors of waltz tested it on the independent dataset from prion protein sup <dig>  which was experimentally derived. they reported that the 3d profile method showed accuracy of  <dig> , with sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig>   <cit> . the database in zipperdb, which is freely available on-line  <cit> , is constantly growing. currently it covers all orfs from  <dig> genomes: h. sapiens, s. cervisiae, and e. coli, with 50% redundancy. interestingly, the database shows hot spots in a majority of proteins. it does not mean that they can easily turn into amyloids in the physiological conditions but it shows new interesting aspects of this topic. unfortunately, the 3d profile method is very computationally expensive and not very simple to use.

in this paper, we propose two methods to extend the zipperdb dataset, classifying hexapeptide candidates at lower computational cost. one of the methods is closely related to the original idea of zipperdb, only reducing the number of profiles. the other one, which introduces the main increase of the efficiency, uses a completely different statistical approach - machine learning. both methods are tested versus original zipperdb database classification.

RESULTS
dataset
we generated a new dataset of  <dig> hexapeptdes, which was later used for training machine learning methods  and trainset), using our version of 3d profile method with very significantly reduced number of profiles , and the method of exact energy calculation proposed in zipperdb  <dig>  <cit> . the dataset contains  <dig> positively and  <dig> negatively classified segments. part of our dataset  is also available in zipperdb  <dig> , which uses the simplified "triplet" method of calculating the energy and fuzzy logic. energies of these hexapeptides, obtained from our study and from zipperdb, were compared. based on the energy criterion,  <dig> % of the segments were identically classified with regard to their amyloid properties . in this set,  <dig>  hexapeptides were classified by our energy value as amyloidogenic; zipperdb classified  <dig>  as amyloidogenic. differently classified hexapeptides often had energies close to the classification threshold of − <dig> kcal/mol. the mean absolute value of the energy difference, between these two sources, was  <dig> kcal/mol; 90% of the difference was below  <dig>  kcal/mol. energy values could differ because of limited number of threading profiles, as well as randomization element in rosetta design. moreover, computationally faster but simplified triplet method, used in zipperdb  <dig>  also affected the results. as stated by the zipperdb authors, who tested it on segments of e. coli orfs, an average error introduced by the triplet method was of  <dig> kcal/mol  with the tendency to overestimate amylogenicity  <cit> .

our study shows that the results from our threading method are very comparable with those from zipperdb  <dig>  in the new part of our dataset ,  <dig>  of the hexapeptides were classified as amyloidogenic . also position dependant frequencies of each aminoacid are similar in our set and the set from zipperdb .

machine learning methods
our dataset, with a binary classification of sequence amyloid propensities based on their calculated energies, was applied for training machine learning methods  <cit> , provided by weka  <cit> . our objective was testing a potential for sequence based machine learning methods, which could be very significantly faster than threading and energy calculation. from a hundred of different machine learning methods, pre-selection was carried out . special consideration was given to methods with the highest potential for biochemical interpretation. from the preliminary tests, using cross-validation on the training set and selected efficiency measures, ten methods gave promising results: alternating decision tree   <cit> , best-first tree   <cit> , functional tree   <cit> , a clone of the repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction   <cit> , a part decision list   <cit> , ripple down rule   <cit> , support vector machine  method, implemented in weka with sequential minimal optimization  algorithm for training a support vector classifier using polynomial or rbf kernels  <cit> , multilayer perceptron   <cit> , naive bayes  <cit> , and random forest   <cit> .

the final results of these  <dig> methods, using a separate test set  are shown in table  <dig>  the parameters of the methods  were optimized. top methods were selected according to their auc roc .


the performance evaluation of the machine learning methods. the results are ordered by decreasing auc.

the tests showed that some of the standard weka methods can be very successfully used for classification of amyloidogenic segments, compatible with 3d profile method. in the best methods, acc was typically close to 90%. the most effective methods from weka were mlp, adtree, and naive bayes .

the best adtree, with  <dig> rules, achieved auc= <dig> , which is close to maximum auc= <dig>  characteristic of an ideal classifier, tpr= <dig> , tnr=  <dig> , and acc=  <dig> . identical results were achieved with mlp classifier. we have also tested if removal of hexapaptides that overlap experimental datasets and introduce a bias in sequences, coming from the highly redundant amylhex dataset, influence the result of our classifiers. the adtree  <dig> trained on the reduced training set, deprived of hexapeptides overlapping amylhex and waltz, showed higher efficiency – it obtained auc= <dig> , tpr= <dig> , tnr= <dig> , and acc= <dig> . the rules  concerning each hexapeptide position are presented and compared in additional file  <dig>  there are some differences between trees built on the full and reduced training sets. for example, the tree from the full training set favored valine at position  <dig> , overrepresented in amylhex, while the tree built on the reduced dataset shows valine only in rule  <dig> , and with factor  <dig> . the trees with a lower number of rules, which are easier for interpretation, are also good classifiers . the top rules for this tree are fairly compatible with the pssm underlying waltz method reported in  <cit> , and they indicate, for example, that isoleucine  is highly expected at position  <dig> , while proline  and arginine  are not welcome .


efficiency of the mlp method was not sensitive to the presence of the redundant hexapeptides in the training set . naive bayes improved its efficiency when trained on the reduced set .

a representative estimate of weka methods performance, which was independent of class distribution and the specifics of the training data set  is presented in table  <dig>  showing the number of wins, draws and losses when all methods are compared to each other for auc. the corrected paired t-test showed that adtree and mlp had statistically significantly higher aucs than other methods, at the 5% of the significance level.

compatibility of the energy based classification with foldamyloid and waltz
to test to what extent the 3d profile method overlaps with other state of the art methods, i.e. how universal its extended datasets could be, we performed the amylogenicity prediction with other tools: foldamyloid and waltz, using different classification methods. foldamyloid is based on the packing density  <cit>  and waltz is based on pssms primarily derived from a dataset classified by physicochemical modeling  <cit> . the whole set of  <dig> hexapeptides was tested, using all foldamyloid options and waltz optimizations for overall performance and sensitivity . the results are summarized in table  <dig> 


compatibility of the 3d profile classification with foldamyloid and waltz.

the overall classification overlap was similar in all methods; typically 80% of the hexapeptides were classified identically, using 3d profile and foldamyloid or waltz. on the other hand, 84-88% of hexapeptides, classified by 3d profile as non-amyloidogenic, were also negatively classified by foldamyloid; waltz overlap of negatives was 91-97%. however, classification of the positive hexapeptides was less compatible - ranging from 11% in waltz best performance method to 43% in foldamyloid triple hybrid method. this result shows that classification of positive instances is more challenging and should become the target. less numerous positive datasets of experimental data, on which all classification methods were previously trained, could contribute to this situation. also in our dataset, only  <dig> % of hexapeptides were regarded as positive. importantly, recognition of non-amyloid segments in the optimal method overlapped in 84%. this means that negative peptides can be eliminated efficiently and consistently between different methods. we have also tested the consensus between 3d profile, foldamyloid triple hybrid and waltz high sensitivity. it turned out that the overlap was 69%, in which positive rate was 21% and negative 65%.

CONCLUSIONS
extending of the hexapeptide dataset, with computationally effective methods, could help in predicting amyloidogenic regions without laboratory experiments, which are currently not possible on all sequence combinations. we proposed an optimization to the classical 3d profile method, and using only  <dig> arbitrarily selected profiles we generated the new dataset of hexapeptides classified with regard to their amylogenicity. energies of our segments showed very good overlap with the segments currently available in zipperdb, which used the simplified triplet method to calculate the energy. the new part of our dataset contains  <dig> segments that have not been previously considered, with  <dig> segments classified by energy value as amyloidogenic.

we also performed the amylogenicity prediction on our dataset, using different classification methods - foldamyloid and waltz. the best result was obtained with foldamyloid triple hybrid method, which overlapped the 3d profile classification in 77% , 43% , and 84% . it showed that different methods are quite compatible in the elimination process, and in this respect datasets generated with the 3d profile methods are universal.

to test whether statistical approach, trained on our dataset, could replace the energy based classifier, we used machine learning methods implemented in weka. our dataset of 6-residue sequences, with a binary classification of their amyloidogenic propensities based on the calculated energy, was applied for training. from all available weka methods, we selected those giving the best results and tested with a separate test set, obtained from zipperdb. our study showed that some of the methods could be very successfully used for classification of amyloidogenic segments, compatible to the 3d profile method. the most effective methods in weka, in terms of auc roc, were alternating decision tree and a neural network of a multilayer perceptron architecture, both with auc= <dig> . the adtree efficiency could be increased to auc= <dig>  when highly redundant set of experimental hexapeptides was removed from the training set. the performance was then very close to an ideal classifier, for which auc= <dig>  a great advantage of adtree method is a set of very easily interpretable rules. part of the rules were fairly compatible with the pssm underlying another classification method -waltz, which was based on different data all those methods could classify almost 80% of positive and 95% of negative hexapeptides identically as the 3d profile method.

such a good result of classification, based only on aminoacid sequence and its binary classification, is very interesting. it shows a good correlation between classification with the laborious 3d profile method ­ using the minimal chain energy from numerous putative structures, and purely statistical machine learning methods - using just  <dig> letters and the binary classification. this is possible only if a strong statistical pattern exists in the amyloid sequences recognized by 3d profile. our results also prove that our new dataset is representative enough for training machine learning methods, in order to obtain amylogenicity of new segments only based on their six letter sequences, with no need to carry out threading procedure and energy evaluation.

the main advantage of the machine learning approach, presented in this paper, is very significantly reduced computational time. instead of 18– <dig> cpu-hours with the full 3d profile method or  <dig>  cpu-hours with the simplified 3d profile, the classification can take below  <dig> cpu-minute with a very good overlap of the results. such a reduction of the computational time is crucial when large amount of hexapeptides should be classified. additionally, the machine learning enhances the simplicity to perform the analysis.
