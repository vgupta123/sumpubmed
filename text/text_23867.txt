BACKGROUND
accurate models of dna and protein evolution are essential for studying molecular evolution. models of dna and protein evolution are used in homology searches  <cit> , sequence alignments  <cit> , gene finding  <cit> , detection of natural selection  <cit> , and reconstruction of phylogenetic trees  <cit> .

recent studies on the mutation rates in non-coding regions have shown that the mutation rates of cpgs in the human genome are negatively correlated to the local gc content  <cit>  and to the densities of functional elements  <cit> .

cpg hypermutability  <cit>  is known to be one of the major causes of codon substitution in mammalian genes  <cit> . cpg dinucleotides are often methylated at c, and methylated c spontaneously deaminates to thymine  approximately  <dig> times  <cit>  or more  <cit>  rapidly than other types of point mutations. approximately 14% of codon substitutions are caused by cpg hypermutations  <cit> . statistical indications of positive selection in some sequences or individual codons may be caused by a difference in mutation rates in the synonymous and nonsynonymous sites because of cpg hypermutations  <cit> . previous studies that focused on the effect of cpg hypermutation on the rate of amino acid change in the human lineage  <cit>  did not incorporate the regional variation in the rates of codon substitution. thus, the regional variation in codon substitutions, especially those related to cpg hypermutation, in the human genome is of interest.

to understand the effect of these genomic features such as gc content, gene density, and frequency of cpg islands on the rates of codon substitution, the rates of codon substitution were estimated by using the coding regions of thousands of human and chimpanzee genes and inferring their ancestral sequences by assuming macaque genes as the outgroup. since the genomic features are interdependent, partial regression coefficients of these features were obtained. multiple regression analyses to evaluate the effect of gc content, gene density, and cpg island density on the rates of cpg to tpg substitutions, tpg to cpg substitutions, and non-cpg transitions and transversions were conducted.

RESULTS
the number of genes on each chromosome is listed in table  <dig>  table  <dig> also shows the gc content and the gene and cpg island density on human chromosomes.

since the genomic features are interdependent, partial regression coefficients of these features were obtained. table  <dig> shows the rates of cpg to tpg and tpg to cpg substitutions and non-cpg transitions and transversions. except tpg to cpg substitutions, all types of substitutions show a significant correlation with grantham's distance, gc content, gene and cpg island density, and chromosome size .

on the basis of these results, a model that incorporates these genetic features was developed. parameter x is calculated as the sum of the intercept and the partial correlation coefficient multiplied by the genetic features, as shown in table  <dig>  for example, x for a synonymous cpg to tpg substitution on chromosome  <dig> is calculated as follows:  <dig>  +  -  +  ×  ×  <dig>  the codon substitution rate can be further calculated as exp.

discussion
in this study, codon substitution rates of cpg to tpg mutations, tpg to cpg mutations, and non-cpg transitions and transversions were estimated by comparing the coding regions of thousands of human and chimpanzee genes from entire genome and inferring their ancestral sequences by assuming macaque genes as the outgroup.

as seen in figure  <dig>  a marked difference was not observed between the synonymous substitution rates of autosomes and x chromosome. this result indicates that the effect of "male-driven evolution"  <cit>  is not strong. the male-driven evolution is a phenomenon in which the number of mutations is proportional to the number of germ-line cell divisions, so that the sperms have a higher rate of mutation than the eggs. there are large discrepancies among the results of previous studies with regard to the effect of male-driven evolution on mutation rates  <cit>  in this study, a large variation in the rates of the substitution caused by cpg hypermutation among chromosomes and genes was observed. the mutation rate of the x chromosome was within the range of the mutation rate among autosomes, which is expected considering the variation in substitution rates among chromosomes. thus, this finding suggests that the effect of male-driven evolution on the mutation rate was less than that of regional variation.

vogel and motulsky  <cit>  pointed out that since the deamination of methyl-c occurs spontaneously and is independent of dna replication, the rate of cpg mutations should be scaled with time and not with the number of cell divisions. recently, taylor et al.  <cit>  investigated male mutation bias separately at non-cpg and cpg sites by using human-chimpanzee whole-genome alignments. they concluded that cpg hypermutation is weakly affected by the number of cell divisions. in this study, i demonstrated that the effect of male-driven evolution on cpg hypermutation is less strong than that of other chromosomal properties. thus, although our result is similar to that of vogel and motulsky  <cit> , i cannot exclude the findings of taylor et al.  <cit> . variation in the mutation rates among chromosomes must be one of the causes of the discrepancies among the results of previous studies with regard to the effect of male-driven evolution on mutation rates. therefore, further study is warranted in this area.

the results presented in this study also suggest that codon substitution rates are positively correlated to gene density. the reason of this correlation is unclear, but it might be due to fact that dna melting is the rate-limiting step in cytosine deamination  <cit> . the difference between cpg hypermutability of the coding and non-coding regions may be due to the difference in the reason of dna melting in the  <dig> regions. in the case of the coding regions, the cause of dna melting is transcription; the dna molecule separates into  <dig> single-strands before being transcribed. the frequency of transcription was positively correlated to the expression level of the gene, which in turn was positively correlated to the number of cpg islands  <cit> . in contrast, the reason for dna melting in the non-coding region is not transcription but denaturation. the base pairs open one at a time, far below the melting temperature, and the half-life of individual gc base pairs are approximately  <dig> times longer than those of individual at base pairs  <cit> , so that the rate of cpg hypermutability in the non-coding region is positively correlated to the local gc content. if this is the case, cpg hypermutability will depend on the expression level of the genes. recent study on mouse genes showed that the effect of gene expression level on codon bias is weaker than both the effect of gene expression level on amino acid composition and the effect of cpg hypermutability on codon bias  <cit> , so that effect of gene expression level on mutation rate would be relatively small. further study is needed in this area.

in this study, the codon substitution rates were estimated by using the coding regions of thousands of human and chimpanzee genes and inferring their ancestral sequences by assuming macaque genes as the outgroup. all types of substitutions show a significant negative correlation to grantham's distance. this result indicates that the properties of amino acids are one of the major factors influencing the variation among non-synonymous substitutions, as previously reported  <cit> .

the reason for the specific correlation found between codon substitution rates and chromosome sizes might be the physical distance between the genes and telomeres. tyekucheva et al.  <cit>  suggested that distances from telomeres play important roles on mutation rates. however, the numbers of substitutions are not very large; thus, dividing too many bins by the distance from the telomeres may yield weak results. as more data become available, incorporating these additional predictors in the regression analyses may be beneficial. of special interest would be data on species other than humans.

on the basis of these results, a model that incorporates these genetic features was developed. the result shown above indicates that including gc content, gene density, cpg island density to the model improves the ability of prediction of the substitution rates

CONCLUSIONS
the substitution rates of codons depend on gene densities of the chromosomes. transcription-associated mutation is one such pressure. on the basis of these results, a model of codon substitutions that incorporates the effect of genomic features on codon substitution in human chromosomes was developed.
