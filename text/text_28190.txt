BACKGROUND
raphanusanin   can be isolated from radish seedlings grown under illumination and plays a role in the light-induced inhibition of hypocotyl growth  <cit> . when applied unilaterally, ra suppresses hypocotyl growth on the treated side more than on the opposite side, inducing a differential growth gradient that causes the hypocotyl to bend towards the side of application  <cit> . blue-light irradiation rapidly decreases the 4-methylthio-3-butenyl glucosinolate  content and abruptly increases the content of 4-methylthio-3-butenyl isothiocyanate  and raphanusanin in the radish hypocotyls within  <dig> min after the onset of irradiation  <cit> . when mtbg, mtbi, and raphanusanin at endogenous levels were applied unilaterally to etiolated hypocotyls, mtbi and raphanusanin caused hypocotyls to bend, but mtbg induced no activity. blue-light irradiation promoted myrosinase  activity, which releases mtbi from mtbg, in hypocotyls after  <dig> min, although the enzyme activity in the dark controls did not change  <cit> . some chemical studies on 4-methylthio-3-butenyl isothiocyanate  have been carried out, where mtb-itc has been spontaneously converted into raphanusanins in meoh-h2o or h2o solution  <cit> . the biosynthetic pathway of ra is shown in figure  <dig>  phototropic stimulation promotes myrosinase activity on the illuminated side of radish hypocotyls, releasing bio-active 4-methylthio-3-butenyl isothiocyanate  from bio-inactive 4-methylthio-3-butenyl glucosinolate , and simultaneously producing bio-active ra. sakoda et al. demonstrated that the iaa-mediated transverse microtubule reorientation is significantly inhibited by the simultaneous addition of ra analogues  <cit> . moreover, nakajima et al. showed that ra inhibited apical dominance in pea seedlings  <cit> . there are certainly additional ways in which ra may help a plant to adapt to the prevailing light environments, and these may be discovered through further photophysiological, cellular, biochemical, and genetic testing. we demonstrated the physiological role of ra in differential growth and identified the first four genes shown to be induced by ra using modified differential display rt-pcr . we characterised one of these genes, rscsn <dig>  as an essential element in the inhibition of hypocotyl growth  <cit> . however, our first attempt using the dd-rt-pcr method was limited to the identification of a large number of genes induced by ra. the comprehensive understanding of the functional activity of ra still remains elusive. to search for additional components required for the understanding of the roles of ra, we constructed the ra-induced gene library using the suppression subtractive hybridisation  technique. the use of a rapid and sensitive mrna expression comparison technique  and its application in comparative studies with light will be crucial to revealing the possible roles of ra and its functional coupling to light signalling. here, we present a comparative investigation of gene regulation in radish seedlings in response to short-term ra and blue-light exposure. among the transcripts identified to be up-regulated in response to raphanusanin, we observed many genes that are related to the multiple signalling of cellular defence. this observation has allowed us to infer raphanusanin regulatory roles for a large fraction of products associated with movement, transporters, protein metabolism, protein kinases, and hydrolases.

RESULTS
raphanusanin-induced genes that are linked to cellular defence
to obtain ra-induced genes, we subtracted the cdnas in the ra-untreated four-day-old radish seedlings from those in the samples treated with ra   <dig> min . starting with two micrograms of poly-a+ rna prepared from ra-treated samples,  <dig> cdna clones induced by ra were obtained . the nucleotide sequences of all of the clones were determined by sequencing the inserts from both ends, altogether generating  <dig> ests . the ra-induced cdna library digested with rsai contained on average  <dig> bp inserts. thus, the sequences from both ends were overlapping. all of the sequences were then assembled by the phrap program  and classified into  <dig> non-redundant forms after building the contigs . all of the  <dig> non-redundant sequences were submitted to the ddbj database with accession numbers assigned . the sequence of each non-redundant est was identified by similarity search in the ncbi non-redundant public sequence database   <cit> . if a gene contained the rsai digestion site, two cdna clones could be identified. therefore, neighbouring clones were joined by alignment with subject sequences obtained by a blast search. after the blast search,  <dig> ra-induced independent genes were identified, and  <dig> were duplicates. of the  <dig> independent genes,  <dig> were demonstrated to have significant homology with arabidopsis thaliana genes,  <dig> were homologous with other organisms such as brassica and chicken, and  <dig> were novel ests . the  <dig> independent genes were classified into three physiological associations or ten biochemical functional categories based on the best blastx match of the corresponding ests against ncbi non-redundant protein database  or tair arabidopsis protein database .

forty-eight of the  <dig> ra-inducible genes  were categorised as related to cellular defence, and  <dig> genes  were categorised as related to energy metabolism . on the other hand,  <dig> of the  <dig> ra-inducible genes  could not be assigned to any physiological category . a high portion of these genes are involved in common defence mechanisms, including cipk <dig>  pti <dig>  gtf, rpk , hsp <dig>  mbp <dig>  camta <dig>  acc oxidase , gtpase, ubq, drp, plc, and pld  <cit> . furthermore, nine genes function in the response to abiotic stress, including usp, sdr, ralf  <dig>  and gasa <dig>  <cit> . there were also five genes known to be involved in toxic catabolic processes and in the response to oxidative stress, such as catalase <dig> , peroxidase, ntra, and mete  <cit> . in addition, two genes, pescadillo and coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase , are induced by dna damage and protein lesions  <cit> .

based on biochemical classification ,  <dig> genes among the  <dig> ra-inducible genes were categorised as signalling-related, such as kinases , protein metabolism/binding , and signal transduction . the leucine-rich repeat  disease-resistance protein kinases, serine/threonine, and tyrosine protein kinases, such as cipk <dig>  pkc, mak, and pti <dig>  were included in the kinase category. six genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, such as csn <dig>  keg, cul <dig>  ump <dig>  ubq <dig>  and ring finger  <cit> , were categorised into protein metabolism. in addition, the nine genes involved in signal transduction are all known to be associated with defence against environmental stress . other than the genes involved in housekeeping functions, those associated with signal transduction, kinases, movement and transporter, and hydrolase were the most abundant . these results indicate that ra induces changes in the genetic network in preparation for a distinct phase of cellular communication. in addition, a bioinformatic analysis revealed that  <dig> genes among the  <dig> ra-induced genes homologous to arabidopsis genes were implicated in the function of the r-gene-triggered resistance in programmed cell death , as shown in table  <dig> 

the determination of reference genes for qrt-pcr
in order to evaluate transcriptional regulation, the selection of the most appropriate and stable housekeeping gene as a control is necessary. the information for choosing the proper housekeeping gene in the radish system is still limited. therefore, the transcript levels of seven housekeeping genes commonly used in plant gene expression analysis, actin <dig>  ubiquitin <dig>  18s rrna, tubulin α- <dig>  rrna protein , initiation factor  <dig> , and elongation factor 1b-alpha , were measured before and after the ra treatment . the entire experiment was performed in triplicate, and the results were combined for statistical analysis. the cycle threshold  of each transcript was compared. tubulin α- <dig> was the most abundant  transcript and l <dig> was the least abundant . the anova f-test of differences among time points after ra treatment indicated that the transcript levels of three genes, ef1α, eif <dig>  and l <dig>  were not significantly altered before and after ra treatment in radish seedlings. two of these three genes, ef1α and eif <dig>  had a small coefficient of variation  . both consistency across time points  and high predictability  are desired for a control. the stability index was calculated based on the product of the slope and the cv . the gene with the lowest stability index provides the best control. in this study, ef1α had the lowest stability index and eif <dig> had the second lowest as evidenced by their low slope and cv. therefore, ef1α and eif <dig> were used to normalise the expression levels of the genes of interest.

defence-related genes are positively regulated in response to raphanusanin
fifty expressed sequence tags  from various functional categories were selected from among the  <dig> independent genes from the ra-induced library to confirm the induction of transcripts by quantitative rt-pcr. three independent preparations of mrna for each biological replicate were pooled to eliminate inconsistencies due to sampling. three independent experiments were carried out from three independent pools. an analysis of the genes exhibiting changes in expression greater than  <dig> -fold or less than  <dig> -fold at both time points  in comparison to the untreated samples revealed that  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . some genes were highly expressed during the first  <dig> min, while others were more pronounced at  <dig> min. an analysis of genes with assigned functional categories revealed that several metabolic processes linked to common protective functions, including the biosynthesis of stress-activated hormones, reactive oxygen scavenging enzymes, signal transducers, and components of the protein degradation system, were up-regulated . the number of up-regulated genes and the expression levels were substantially greater at  <dig> min than at  <dig> min . this difference could be attributed to the early activation of genes underlying the mechanistic response to ra. among the down-regulated genes, the transcript levels of rmb <dig> and rmb <dig> were lower at  <dig> min, whereas those of cnd <dig> and pkc were lower at  <dig> min. the highly expressed genes, ntra  and peroxidase , are reactive oxygen-scavenging enzymes involved in the removal of superoxide radicals  <cit> . in addition, drp, erecta , and camta  <dig>  are signal transducers that rescue cells from pathogenic attacks  <cit> . two genes, acco and mbp <dig> , encode the genes involved in induction of the major defence-related hormones, ethylene and jasmonate acid, respectively  <cit> . it should be noted that seven genes  involved in the proteolytic pathway were up-regulated in response to ra. these genes are implicated in the regulation of a vast array of biological processes, including the cell cycle  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit> , the adaptive immune system  <cit> , plant growth regulation  <cit> , and responses to oxidative stress  <cit> . the most highly expressed genes were defence-associated genes, implicating the correlation of ra with cellular defence.

raphanusanin is functionally coupled with the early blue-light response
because ra is a blue light -induced growth inhibitor of radish seedlings  <cit> , elucidating the relationship between ra and blue light is a crucial step in understanding the proper roles of ra. to obtain information regarding the strict specificity of the ra involvement in the early light-mediated development, four-day-old etiolated radish seedlings were irradiated with three different kinds of bl fluences. the transcriptional profiles of  <dig> highly ra-inducible genes were analysed in response to bl. the  <dig> ests were commonly regulated by the different intensities and durations of bl irradiation . many stress-related genes  were observed to respond early during the first five minutes of high-fluence pulses, while they increased dramatically over time in the continuous light of low fluence, potentially resulting from the reciprocity of the dose response . two genes  were specific to the continuous-light response, and three genes  were specific to the pulsed-light response. there were also a few genes regulated by ra and bl in the opposite manners . the observed responses for different fluences reveal that the range of fluences over which the response specificities to continuous or pulsed light may be attributed to the action of phot <dig> at lower fluence rates  and phot <dig> at higher fluence rates . several genes involved in growth inhibition were up-regulated by ra and bl . to validate, the expression levels of seven genes participating in growth inhibition were measured by semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis . these results suggest that blue light facilitates the expression of ra-inducible genes.

discussion
in this study, we constructed a ra-specific subtraction library and further selected  <dig> genes based on the expression analysis to analyse their functional correlation with the early blue-light response. the existence of highly specific genes and low percentages of housekeeping genes indicate that the subtraction was effectively performed for the ra+-ra- library. since ssh is expected to normalise the dna population, the less prevalent genes and highly redundant genes contained in the ra+-ra- library indicate that the normalisation was successful. the abundance of functionally annotated genes and, in particular, the high proportion of genes related to signalling suggests that ra activates distinct genetic networks. this high subtractive efficiency allowed us to monitor the expression of many genes in different biochemical or physiological pathways in which ra is implicated.

does raphanusanin modulate cellular defence?
the molecular evidence reported herein indicates that raphanusanin  is involved in several metabolic processes in which many defence-associated genes are up-regulated and very few genes are down-regulated . accordingly, questions arise with regard to why ra activates many defence-associated genes and how this is associated with cellular defence. ra induced the regulation of leucine-rich repeat  proteins, lrr transmembrane proteins, the receptor-like kinase , serine-threonine kinases, and glycoproteins . several studies have emphasised the conserved functions of lrr domains, lrr transmembrane proteins  <cit> , membrane-spanning glycoproteins such as hydroxyl proline-rich glycoproteins  <cit> , rlks such as erecta  <cit> , and cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinases, such as ca+ inducers. cbl-interacting protein kinase   <cit>  acted as a resistant  protein in the defence system. van der biezen and jones hypothesised that r proteins may function as regulatory adaptors in plant apoptosomes that are activated by pathogen-derived avirulence  signals  <cit> .

moreover, ra-induced genes , such as the antioxidant genes ntra, cat, and peroxidase, the channel activators camta <dig>  kt, pot, and h+ atpase, the lignin-associated genes drp and peroxidase , the membrane-associated g-protein rab, and cpox are involved in the signal transduction network of the hr -related programmed cell death  in plants  <cit> . the earliest cellular response upon r activation includes a rapid burst of reactive oxygen species , leading to a dramatic increase in oxidation reactions, increased transmembrane ion flux, especially of ca+, k+ and h+, the cross-linking of phenolic moieties with cell-wall components and the reinforcement of the plant cell wall , the transient activation of protein kinases -induced kinases), the production of defensins and phytoalexins, the synthesis of resistance  proteins, and transcriptional reprogramming  <cit> .

many reports have highlighted the involvement of ion channels, especially that of ca+, on the plasma membrane during early defence signalling in arabidopsis, tomato, tobacco, and parsley  <cit> . camta  <dig> mutants attenuated the propagation of a virulent strain of the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae and the fungal pathogen botrytis cinerea during arabidopsis development  <cit> . the rapid and sustained increase in ca+ is necessary for the oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death facilitated by the plant disease resistance gene, rpm <dig>  in arabidopsis  <cit> . subsequently, the production of ross leads to cell-wall fortification, the induction of defence gene expression, and pcd  <cit> . the nadph thioredoxin  is involved in the signalling associated with apoptosis and hypersensitivity to stress in arabidopsis  <cit> . the loss of function in the arabidopsis double mutant ntra ntrb plant results in hypersensitivity to buthionine sulfoximine , a specific inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, demonstrating the involvement of ntr genes in the glutathione pathway  <cit> . moreover, drp has been suggested to play a role in defence responses and in promoting lignin deposition in juglone-stressed soybeans  <cit> . peroxidase is associated with the catalytic reactions of h2o <dig>  and many studies demonstrate the peroxidase-reduced cell-wall extensibility and elevated lignin content in stressed plants  <cit> . furthermore, arabidopsis lesion initiation  <dig>  encodes cpox, and the lin <dig> mutant develops lesions on its leaves and siliques in a developmentally regulated and light-dependent manner  <cit> .

the abundance of genes involved in protein metabolism is remarkable, especially those genes comprising the ubiquitin-proteosome system, hsp <dig>  pmf <dig>  csn <dig>  ubq <dig>  cul <dig>  keg , and c3hc4-type ring finger. the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway is likely to be an important modulator of the r-gene-triggered resistance  <cit> . one study showed that one regulator of r-genes, sgt <dig> , is essential for the function of the skp1-cullin-f-box protein  e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex that targets proteins for degradation by the 26s proteosome. rar <dig> , sgt <dig>  and hsp <dig> are thought to form a complex that mediates the folding of r proteins into functional complexes  <cit> . in addition, the cop <dig> signalosome, a multiprotein complex involved in the recognition of correct substrates for protein degradation, is required for the resistance to tobacco mosaic virus mediated by the tobacco tir-nb-lrr n protein  <cit> . moreover, ring-finger e <dig> ligases in arabidopsis are involved in the rpm1- and rps2-mediated elicitation of hr  <cit> . the knock-down of ring <dig> transcripts with an artificial microrna  leads to hyposensitivity to the pathogenic toxin fumonisin b <dig> , whereas over-expression of ring <dig> confers hypersensitivity  <cit> . furthermore, arabidopsis cul <dig>  was assembled into the scf complex containing coi <dig>  an f-box protein required for the response to jasmonates , which regulate plant fertility and defence responses  <cit> , and keg, an e <dig> ligase that acts as a negative regulator of abscisic acid  signalling in arabidopsis. the keg mutant undergoes growth arrest immediately after germination, suggesting an increase in aba signalling that regulates the plant survival in unfavourable conditions  <cit> .

moreover, ra positively regulated mbp <dig> , 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase  , and camta <dig> , also correlating with r-gene functions in the hormonal control of pcd activation  <cit> . the hormone ethylene  is involved in stimulating developmental and inducible forms of pcd during aerenchyma formation  <cit> . et positively contributes to hr cell death and lesion size in tmv-infected tobacco leaves, as well as in tomato plants challenged with an avirulent xanthomonas strain  <cit> . moreover, infection with tmv activates the sipk cascade  and induces ethylene biosynthesis. it also induces acc oxidase  <cit>  because pest-induced wounding increased the acc oxidase protein in the conifer stem, whereas the methyl jasmonate  treatment produced a higher and more rapid acc oxidase response, indicating the coordinated action of et and ja in defence  <cit> . furthermore, ja has been shown to promote cell death events induced by singlet oxygen in the protoplasts of the conditional flu mutant in arabidopsis  <cit>  and to affect hairpin-induced hypersensitive cell death in tobacco suspension-cultured by- <dig> cells  <cit> . genes encoding myrosinase-binding proteins  were shown to be h2o2-responsive  <cit> , and h2o <dig> induces pcd in arabidopsis and other species  <cit> .

ra has also been shown to induce the regulation of the phosphatidic acid precursors, phospholipase c  and phospholipase d , both of which modulate the pcd as lipid-based signals. for example, the expression of the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase c gene, ospi-plc <dig>  was activated in rice cells after benzothiadiazole  treatment and in bth-treated cells after xanthomonas oryza pv. oryza  infection, resulting in the production of an oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death  <cit> . the coactivation of plc, pld, and et induces pcd in tomato, and inhibitors of the plc and pld signalling pathway intermediates greatly reduce the chemical-induced cell death of suspension-cultured tomato  cells . ethylene, while not inducing cell death when applied alone, stimulates chemical-induced cell death, indicating that the activation of the plc, pld, and et signalling pathways is required for cell death  <cit> .

the primary role of ra in hypocotyl growth inhibition, as demonstrated by moehninsi et al.  <cit> , is likely due to cell-wall strengthening via the induction of lignin to protect cells from environmental stimuli. alternatively, the interactions between defence and growth suppression could also be a main reason for induction of genes involved in both defence and growth suppression signalling. in support of this notion, one study shows that the indirect activation of the mapk cascade in h2o2-treated arabidopsis protoplasts induced the expression of genes involved in defence against oxidative stress and suppressed those associated with growth  <cit> . in our ra+-ra- library, four genes thought to be implicated in the functional roles of growth inhibition, drp, peroxidase, rapid alkalinisation factor  <dig> , and csn <dig>  were up-regulated in response to ra. ralf <dig> is associated with defence via its activation of mapks and the induction of medium alkalinisation, leading to growth arrest  <cit> . moreover, a rapid transient up-regulation of csn <dig> is observed in response to various growth inhibition stimuli  <cit> . in addition, the up-regulation of cellular biogenesis genes such as actin, profilin, cellulose synthase 5-transferase, kinesin, and α-tubulins may also be involved in elaborate cell-wall thickening.

raphanusanin-induced gene networks associated with early blue-light  signalling
an attempt to identify the functional correlations between ra and light regulation led us to monitor the expression of many genes in response to different fluences of early bl. we found that the selected  <dig> genes were commonly regulated under bl in an intensity or duration-dependent manner . in addition, most gene expression patterns largely overlapped between the bl and exogenous ra treatments. the above results contribute to an emerging body of evidence indicating that ra may be functionally correlated with early bl, and thereby affects the regulation of genes involved in establishing plant acclimation to light.

early blue light effects include the hyperpolarisation of the cell membrane, increased input resistance, and induction of carotenoid biosynthesis, all of which can be observed within the first  <dig> min after the exposure to light. in addition, light-induced mrna synthesis of some fast light-regulated genes can be detected within five min after a light pulse  <cit> . our data are in agreement with the above findings that many genes are induced within the first  <dig> min, including membrane transporters and many defence-associated and chloroplast-associated genes. the overlapping expression of many genes, especially those with conserved functions involved in early light responses between bl and ra, indicates that bl and ra may use a similar signalling mechanism. many studies show that a rapid phot1-dependent ca2+ concentration increase occurs in response to blue-light exposure  <cit> , thereby triggering the inhibition of hypocotyl growth  <cit> . in addition, the proton extrusion of the phot1-mediated stomatal opening is mediated by an h+-atpase or proton pump, which is triggered by phosphorylation  <cit> . furthermore, pedmale and liscum demonstrated the links between phot <dig>  nph <dig>  and e <dig> based-ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation in light-mediated processes  <cit> . the transporters , membrane bound kinases, e <dig> ligases, and genes that trigger ca2+ influx, such as  <dig>   <dig>  5-ip3-catalyzing enzyme plc, camta <dig>  and cipki, are differentially regulated in response to both bl and ra. in addition, under low-bl fluence rates, phot <dig> is the principle photoreceptor regulating both growth inhibition and phototropism  <cit> . with regard to our experimental system, the ability of unilateral irradiation with low light  fluences of bl to inhibit growth is expected to be under phots control. taken together, the differential expression of genes induced by bl in this context is likely to be triggered by phots, and the unique signalling cascades triggered by phots may reflect crosstalk between the light and defence systems. this notion is supported by a report showing that the fmn moiety of phot <dig> confers redox sensitivity that leads to its activation  <cit> . many previous studies demonstrated bl-induced gene expression profile changes using experimental conditions that include high light  and long time-exposure  <cit> . our data showing gene expression profiles within the first  <dig> min under ll intensities are informative with regard to the signalling pathways responsive to variable fluence rates and early light responses while plants are acclimating to sudden environmental changes. this information may be useful for identifying the photosensory signalling networks that interact with cellular defence.

raphanusanin may mediate the links between the light signalling and defence responses
because ra induces the up-regulation of many defence-related genes, the obvious question is how light affects the ra-induced signalling cascades involved in the induction of transcription factors and their target genes. earlier studies have pointed out that light not only modulates the defence responses via its influence on biochemistry and plant development, but is also essential for the development of resistance  <cit> . for examples, light is necessary for development of the resistance responses to pseudomonas solanacearum in tobacco   <cit> , xanthomonas oryzae in rice   <cit> , and pseudomonas syringae and peronospora parasitica in arabidopsis  <cit> . there are also several examples of plant responses to isolated pathogenic elicitors that are light-dependent. leaf necrosis on tomato in response to an avirulence elicitor from cladosporium fulvum is substantially reduced in the dark  <cit> , cell death induced by the fungal toxins aal from alternaria alternata  <cit>  requires light, and one of the pathogenic toxins  capable of inducing cell death in arabidopsis protoplasts is light-dependent and requires phytohormones, as well as the sa, ja, and et-mediated signalling pathways  <cit> . the importance of the cellular energy status and redox balance  produced in chloroplasts and plant stress responses in the regulation of pcd is supported by the finding that various forms of cell death triggered by pathogens, or spontaneously in lesion-mimic mutants, are light-dependent  <cit> . additionally, at least some of the pathways involved in the biosynthesis of the major-related hormones, ja, sa, and aba, are located in the chloroplast, thus revealing a role for photosynthesis in both abiotic and biotic stress responses  <cit> . considering that, many ra-induced genes involved in the predicted pcd pathways may simply reflect the light-dependent manner of pcd, and the roles of ra in cellular defence may be dependent upon light.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report on comprehensive survey of transcriptional regulation in response to the light-induced growth inhibitor, ra. although physiological evidence for it roles in the inhibition of hypocotyls growth, microtubule orientation, and inhibition of apical dominance have been demonstrated, the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation by ra are still limited. our data offer the comprehensive understanding of transcriptional regulation in etiolated radish seedlings in response to ra and its functional correlation with bl. we also provide a number of genes that are regulated in response to ra that could be tested in many functional analyses to increase our understanding of the roles of ra. most of the genes important for cellular defence are highly regulated by both ra and bl. these results suggest the link between ra and cellular defence and light signalling. further research on the biological relevance of the effects of ra on plant-light-microbe interactions and the analysis of null mutants in specific pathways should provide new insights into the role of ra in cellular defence.
