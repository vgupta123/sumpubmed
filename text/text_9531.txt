BACKGROUND
peripheral myelination is important for rapid body movement and sensing several environmental stimuli  <cit> . the pmp <dig> gene encodes a hydrophobic tetraspan membrane protein which is a member of the junction protein family claudin/emp/pmp <dig>  <cit> . in the peripheral nerve system , pmp <dig> contributes to the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath  <cit> . it is known that in mammals an increase of the pmp <dig> transcription level induces a reduction in nerve conduction velocity , coupled with abnormal axonal myelination. in charcot-marie-tooth disease type1a  patients, the majority have a heterozygous tandem duplication of chromosome 17p <dig> -p <dig>  a  <dig>  mbp region that includes pmp <dig>  and the patients undergo slow ncv and distal muscle weakness  <cit> . thus, pmp <dig> transcription is likely to be tightly regulated to prevent over-expression. understanding the regulatory mechanisms of this gene might improve treatment of cmt1a patients.

promoter regions and some regulatory motifs of mammalian pmp <dig> have been reported. transgenic rodent studies have shown the promoter regions and sequence conservation of the gene  <cit> . some in vitro studies have identified regulatory motifs for schwann cell specific expression of pmp <dig>  <cit> . however, unidentified functional sequences for modulation of pmp <dig> expression might be found by comparative genomics analyses.

the comparative genomics approach between jawed fishes and mammals facilitates the identification of novel conserved motifs  <cit> . pufferfish, a teleost fish, have a compact genome, which has few redundant non-coding regions and is useful for finding functional sequences  <cit> . the elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish, has a genome with more conserved sequences with the human genome than the teleost fish genomes, and is expected to assist in the identification of novel essential motifs  <cit> . pufferfish and the elephant shark are, however, unsuitable for experimental procedures. two well known experimental teleost fish, zebrafish and medaka are available for both bioinformatics analyses and laboratory research.

in the present vertebrate phylogeny, the myelin sheath is seen only among jawed vertebrates  <cit> . it is unclear whether an adequate pmp <dig> transcription level is necessary for correct myelination in all jawed vertebrates. to address this issue, we established a transgenic medaka fish line overexpressing pmp <dig> and analyzed aberrations in their pns. although zebrafish is more universally used for experiments, we focused on medaka fish  <cit> , because the medaka fish genome has shorter non-coding regions than the zebrafish  <cit> , and thus is advantageous for bioinformatics analyses. comparative genomics analyses were performed to identify conserved non-coding sequences. our study reveals that pmp <dig> has an important role in myelin formation not only in mammals but also in fishes, and shows that the gene structure and some regulatory motifs are conserved among jawed vertebrates.

RESULTS
in silico identification of the pmp <dig> ortholog in medaka fish
to identify the pmp <dig> ortholog in medaka fish, a phylogenic tree of the emp/pmp <dig> family was drawn based on the amino acid sequence alignment . the teleost fish genomes, which have undergone another genome duplication compared to other vertebrates  <cit> , have pmp <dig> paralogs. in medaka fish, two candidate est sequences for pmp <dig>  including the full length coding regions, are on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  both of which correspond to human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the pmp <dig> cluster that includes mammalian orthologs is clearly separated from the other sequences . the medaka fish est sequence am <dig>  which maps to the syntenic region of lg <dig>  clustered with mammalian pmp <dig> sequences. the transmembrane regions, n <dig> glycosylation site  and c terminus er-retention/retrieval signal   <cit>  are conserved in the pmp <dig> cluster . this suggests that the gene on lg <dig> has been conserved as pmp <dig> in medaka fish  and the other gene has been destined for degradation or neo-functionalization. thus, we focused on the ol_pmp <dig> candidate encoded on lg <dig>  ol_pmp <dig> endogenous transcription was detected in multiple tissues of adult fish .

reduction in peripheral nerve conduction velocity and aberrant myelination in the ol_pmp <dig> over-expression fish
we constructed a plasmid containing the promoterless frt flanked egfp coding sequence with a polyadenylation site. the flp/frt recombination system is more active than the cre/loxp system at approximately 26°c  <cit> , which is a suitable temperature for medaka fish breeding. an  <dig> kbp fragment containing the region upstream of the ol_pmp <dig> translation start codon and the flag tagged ol_pmp <dig> coding region with a polyadenylation site were inserted into the promoter and downstream of the frt flanked region, respectively . this construct was injected into the one-cell stage medaka fish stii   <cit> . we obtained a transgenic fish line with egfp expression, regulated by the region upstream of the ol_pmp <dig> translation start codon, . we observed distinct gfp fluorescence from  <dig> day postfertilization  . strong egfp fluorescence was observed in the boundary region of the midbrain/hindbrain, longitudinal fissure of cerebrum, eye epithelium, olfactory epithelium, spinal cord, gill, liver, kidney, pharynx, intestine, bulbous arteriosus and fin fibroblast in the  <dig> dpf gfp fish . though there was a time lag from gfp transcription to fluorescence, the gfp fish fluorescence pattern was consistent with a zebrafish pmp <dig> study, which was the first report of fish pmp <dig>  <cit> . an immunofluorescence study using anti-gfp antibody showed transgene expression in adult schwann cells, indicating that the  <dig> kbp region upstream of the ol_pmp <dig> translation start codon contains sequences for schwann cell expression . then, we injected the synthesized flp recombinase mrna into the one-cell stage gfp fish to remove the frt flanked region, and established the ol_pmp <dig> over-expression fish line . the transgene, flag tagged ol_pmp <dig>  was transcribed in the pmp <dig> fish, and transcribed at a low level in the gfp fish . however quantitative rt-pcr showed no significant difference in total ol_pmp <dig> mrna levels between the wild type and gfp fish. compared to the control lines, wild type and gfp fish, the ol_pmp <dig> transcription level was approximately two-fold higher in the pmp <dig> fish .

to observe the electrical excitability of the fish pns, population spikes of nerve fibers activated by electrical stimulation were detected in sagittal sections of the adult fish trunk. activated spikes were not observed with the sodium channel blocker, ttx  with  <dig> μa stimulation, suggesting that the spikes were generated by electrical excitability of neurons . we observed the peaks of population spikes immediately after  <dig> μa stimulation and estimated the ncv by the distance between two channels divided by the time lag of the peaks . the wild type and gfp fish had similar ncvs , while the pmp <dig> fish had approximately one fifth the control line ncv value  .

to test kinematic abnormalities, we observed medaka fish swimming in running water. medaka fish usually swim against the current to keep their position. however, in a rapid current, the fish were swept downstream while swimming against the current. we measured flow distances of the wild type, gfp fish and pmp <dig> fish per time in rapid water current . the pmp <dig> fish had a tendency to be swept away faster than the control lines , indicating that pmp <dig> over-expression causes weak swimming ability in medaka fish.

from external observations, there were not obvious morphological and developmental abnormalities between the controls and pmp <dig> fish. however, aberrations were observed in cross sections of pmp <dig> fish motor nerve fibers by electron microscopy . the pmp <dig> fish might have undergone hypo- and hypermyelination in the pns, similar to the mammalian cmt1a phenotype. in the pmp <dig> fish pns, almost all observed myelin sheaths were likely to be thin and uncompacted . we observed abnormal features, which looked like attenuated fibers, in- and outfolding myelin , enlarged schwann cell nuclei , bare axons , wide periaxonal spaces , loose basal laminas , and granules between the nerve fiber and myelin sheath . furthermore, we observed macrophages near the fibers with myelin debris . these abnormalities were not observed in the wild type pns. although the typical onion bulb formation, which is the remarkable feature of demyelinating-remyelinating neuropathies, was not observed in the pmp <dig> fish, our observations indicate that prevention of pmp <dig> over-expression is important for keeping fast peripheral ncv and maintaining the myelin sheath in jawed vertebrates.

alternative first exons have been conserved in ol_pmp22
human and rodent pmp <dig> genes have alternative untranslated first exons, 1a and 1b  <cit> . exon1a, located upstream of exon1b, is transcribed in schwann cells, while the 1b transcript is ubiquitously expressed. in the database, ol_pmp <dig> est sequences always have the same first exon. to confirm whether ol_pmp <dig> has a single first exon or alternative first exons, we constructed the egfp expression constructs regulated by several regions upstream of the ol_pmp <dig> translation start codon, and analyzed the egfp fluorescence patterns by a transient expression assay. the constructs, p11- <dig>  p <dig> - <dig>  p3- <dig>  p <dig> - <dig>  and p11- <dig>  contain  <dig> kbp,  <dig>  kbp,  <dig> kbp,  <dig>  kbp to  <dig> kbp followed by  <dig>  kbp, and  <dig> kbp to  <dig> kbp upstream of the translation start codon, respectively . the fish injected with p11- <dig> and p <dig> - <dig> had egfp fluorescence in morphologically identified schwann cells  <cit>  and other tissues . although our transient expression assay was not quantitative, the p11- <dig> fish had more egfp expression than the p <dig> - <dig> fish, except in the schwann cells. the p3- <dig> fish had no visible egfp expression in the schwann cells; however, it had fluorescence in other tissues . compared to the p3- <dig> fish, egfp expression in the p <dig> - <dig> fish was distinct in schwann cells, but not in other tissues . we identified the first exon of the egfp transcript of the p <dig> - <dig>  as the region corresponding to ol_pmp <dig> exon1a . the transcription start site  of the ol_pmp <dig> 1a transcript is located  <dig>  bp upstream of the translation start codon. then we observed egfp fluorescence only in schwann cells of the p11- <dig> fish . this finding suggests that the exon-intron structure of pmp <dig> has been conserved in jawed vertebrates.

primer sets for the detection of 1a, 1b and total ol_pmp <dig> transcripts were designed. we measured mrna levels in the whole bodies of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpf wild type fish . beta-actin transcripts were detected for an internal control. each average of  <dig> dpf ol_pmp <dig> levels was defined as  <dig>  to quantify the relative transcription levels of total, 1a and 1b . the 1a transcript was significantly upregulated in  <dig> dpf, then decreased in  <dig> dpf and increased again in  <dig> dpf. on the other hand, in transient expression assays, the fish with p11- <dig>  lacking the region downstream of exon1a, had no fluorescence until the hatching stage , whereas the others, p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> - <dig> fish, were visible in the schwann cell lineage from the embryonic stage . these results suggest that the regulatory mechanism of 1a transcription before the hatching stage is different from after hatching, and intron1a contains the region for embryonic stage specific regulation.

conserved sequences in the pmp <dig> region
some regulatory motifs have already been identified in the promoter regions of human and rodent pmp <dig> exon1a  <cit> . nf <dig> is a conserved non-coding sequence of myelin genes and is located between the tata-box and the tss of the pmp <dig> 1a promoter. sreb is the binding site for the sterol regulatory element binding proteins which are transcription factors for cholesterol homeostasis. the fp <dig> motif b is a conserved regulatory motif in myelin gene promoters. creb, which is the binding site for the cyclic amp response element binding protein, has been conserved in several gene promoters in vertebrates  <cit> . thus, we analyzed the pmp <dig> conserved non-coding sequences in jawed vertebrates.

first, in the ol_pmp <dig> region, we examined the region upstream of exon1a and downstream of the stop codon . we scanned for four known conserved mammalian motifs in the promoter region of ol_pmp <dig> exon1a by a motif finding program  <cit> . although nf <dig> and sreb were not found, we identified two known regulatory motifs, fp <dig> motif b and creb . the fp <dig> motif b is located immediately upstream of the tss of human and rodent pmp <dig> exon1a  <cit> . the rat schwannoma cell study revealed that the region around the fp <dig> motif b is involved with positive regulation of pmp <dig> 1a transcription, and identified the important residues of this motif for dna-protein interaction , located at  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp downstream of the motif  <cit> . the fp <dig> motif b is also found in the promoter region of ol_pmp <dig> exon1a , however the important residues are not fully conserved , which is the sequence at the corresponding position in mammals. in the promoter region of human pmp <dig> , creb is identified as the silencer at  <dig>  kbp upstream of the 1a tss  <cit> . we identified creb sites at - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig> in mouse pmp <dig>  exon1a and ol_pmp <dig> exon1a, respectively.

to identify novel conserved non-coding sequences of pmp <dig> in jawed vertebrates, we performed comparative genomics analyses. among hs_, mm_ and ol_pmp <dig>  the multiple alignment of genomic sequences revealed some conserved sequences in the non-coding regions . then, we analyzed these conserved regions in pmp <dig> of jawed vertebrates. although, some conserved non-coding regions, located in intron2– <dig> among hs_, mm_ and ol_pmp <dig>  were not found in other species, the 3'utr sequence was highly conserved among jawed vertebrates, which includes an mrna destabilization signal  . this conserved sequence starts approximately  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp downstream of the pmp <dig> stop codon. next, we searched for short conserved sequences by a motif finding program  <cit> . we tried several combinations of the species in each region. one significant sequence pattern was found in intron1a among human, mouse, rat and medaka fish. because exon1a has only been identified in human, mouse, rat and medaka fish, we searched for this pattern in the upstream region of exon1b in other species. this pattern was significantly conserved in jawed vertebrates, suggesting that the pattern is likely to be functional .

discussion
pmp <dig> over-expression causes reduction in peripheral ncv and aberrant myelination in jawed vertebrates
increase of pmp <dig> expression causes cmt1a in humans and rodents. cmt1a patients, which have a heterozygous tandem duplication of a  <dig>  mbp region that includes hs_pmp <dig>  have reduced peripheral ncv, aberrant myelination and distal muscle atrophy  <cit> . cmt1a rodent models with pmp <dig> over-expression, have been established to understand and treat this neuropathy  <cit> . in mouse models with a human yac containing hs_pmp <dig>  the degree of the cmt1a phenotype depends on the hs_pmp <dig> transcription level associated with yac copy number  <cit> . the c <dig> mouse, a cmt1a model with  <dig> yac copies, shows significant demyelinating neuropathy. a mouse study with tetracycline inducible pmp <dig> over-expression reveals that demyelination occurs only when pmp <dig> is highly expressed in adult, and that the neuropathic phenotype is reversible  <cit> . rat in vivo and in vitro studies show that progesterone promotes pmp <dig> 1a transcription in schwann cells  <cit> . a cmt1a rat model, having  <dig>  fold higher pmp <dig> transcription than wild type rats, is used for the progesterone antagonist test. the progesterone antagonist reduces pmp <dig> expression level. the treated cmt1a rats show higher motor performance than controls with the relief of muscle atrophy and sciatic nerve demyelination  <cit> . ascorbic acid improves the cmt1a phenotype through the inhibition of cyclic amp stimulation of pmp <dig> transcription. the ascorbic acid treated c <dig> mice have more activity, correct myelination and a longer life span than control neuropathy mice  <cit> . the principles of these treatments are based on the reduction of pmp <dig> transcription. recently, another approach for the treatment of this neuropathy has been reported. in the c <dig> schwann cells, there are large aggresomes, including pmp <dig> and ubiquitin, at perinuclear regions  <cit> . also, the hsp <dig> inhibitor promotes heat shock protein expression, and corrects schwann cell myelination with clearance of aggregated pmp <dig>  <cit> .

the myelin sheath enables saltatory conduction in animals  <cit> . the jawed vertebrates have myelinated axons and conserved pmp <dig>  to analyze the relationship between pmp <dig> transcription level and peripheral myelination in medaka fish, pmp <dig> fish were established. compared with control lines, ol_pmp <dig> overexpressing fish, having approximately two-fold higher transcription of ol_pmp <dig>  have one fifth peripheral ncv and aberrant pns myelination, in spite of the transgene lacking intron 2– <dig> and the region downstream of the coding regions . cmt1a patients and rodent models have hypo- and hypermyelination, attenuated fibers and onion bulb formations in the pns  <cit> . in pns, pmp <dig> interacts with α6β <dig> integrin to stabilize the attachment between the basal lamina and myelin sheath  <cit> . the β <dig> integrin and distroglycan double knockout mice lose myelin sheath stability with loose basal laminas and macrophage infiltration  <cit> . the macrophage-mediated myelin disruption occurs in human cmt1a with the pmp <dig> duplication  <cit> , the c <dig> mouse with  <dig> yac copies  <cit> , the myelin glycoprotein p <dig> heterozygous deficient mouse  <cit> , and the gap junction protein cx <dig> null mouse  <cit> . p <dig> and cx <dig> contribute to myelin formation in pns  <cit> . similar to these phenotypes observed in the pns in mammals, we found loose basal laminas and macrophages including myelin debris in the pns of pmp <dig> fish . therefore our observations of the pmp <dig> fish suggest that the association of pmp <dig> expression levels with myelin maintenance is common among jawed vertebrates. although, the pmp <dig> fish have normal growth, feeding and mating throughout life in the laboratory, it seems that prevention of pmp <dig> over-expression provides some advantages for selective pressure because of reduced ncv, weak swimming ability against the current and aberrant myelination caused by pmp <dig> over-expression in medaka fish.

the exon-intron structure and non-coding motifs of pmp <dig> are conserved
the pmp <dig> sequence is highly conserved in jawed vertebrates, but less so in the chordate  <cit> . alignments show that there are many conserved non-coding regions among mammals, and some regions in jawed vertebrates. human and rodent pmp <dig> consist of alternative untranslated first exons, 1a and 1b  <cit> , and four coding exons. mammalian exon1a, located upstream of exon1b, is specifically expressed in schwann cells. the alternative first exons also exist in ol_pmp <dig>  suggesting that the common ancestor of teleost fishes and mammals had these exons, and the gene structure has been conserved in present jawed vertebrates. the ol_pmp <dig> 1a transcript was upregulated in near hatching stage fish , which have immature schwann cells with radial sorting in correspondence with zebrafish and rodent development  <cit> . radial sorting is a step for differentiation from immature schwann cells into myelinating schwann cells. in this step, immature schwann cells establish a 1: <dig> relationship with axons. on the other hand, as well as the rodent pmp <dig> 1a transcript, which is elevated during myelination after birth  <cit> , ol_pmp <dig> 1a transcription increased after hatching . these results suggest that there is similar temporal expression of pmp <dig> 1a transcription among jawed vertebrates.

our bioinformatics analyses found that ol_pmp <dig> has two known conserved regulatory motifs . the fp <dig> motif b  is conserved immediately upstream of the tss of pmp <dig> exon1a  <cit> . this motif is found in promoters of essential myelin genes in mammals. while in the promoter region of hs_pmp <dig> exon1a, a creb half-site  has been identified as the silencer responding to low cyclic amp levels  <cit> . a creb half-site and creb tg variant   <cit>  were found in the mm_ and ol_pmp <dig> exon1a promoter region, respectively. however, it is unclear whether both of these creb sites are functional.

in mammalian schwann cells, pmp <dig> 1a transcription is activated by the zinc finger transcription factor egr <dig>  which is the major positive regulator for essential myelin genes  <cit> . the direct target genes of egr <dig> are p <dig>  mbp, mag, prx and dhh, but not pmp <dig>  <cit> . in the ol_pmp <dig> region, the egr <dig> binding motif was not found in our analyses. in a transgenic mouse study, over-expression of pou-domain protein pou3f <dig> downregulates pmp <dig> transcription  <cit> . there are many candidate sequences for pou3f <dig> binding in the promoter region of ol_pmp <dig> ; however it is unknown which sites are functional. micrornas mir- <dig> and mir-29a inhibit pmp <dig> translation  <cit> . the binding sequences for mir- <dig> and mir-29a are conserved among human, rodent and chicken pmp <dig>  but not among amphibian and jawed fish pmp <dig> 

furthermore, in this study, two additional conserved sequences were found. the pmp <dig> gene has highly conserved sequence in the 3'utr, the length of which is about  <dig> bp, and includes an mrna destabilization signal . this 3'utr sequence is unique in the genome. it is possible that the 3'utr conservation contributes to modulating the pmp <dig> level by transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulation. by using a motif finding program, the novel conserved short sequence was found in intron1a of human, rodent and medaka fish pmp <dig> and in the upstream region of exon1b of the other species pmp <dig> . in our transient expression assay, fish having the gfp expression construct, lacking the region downstream of exon1a, had no fluorescence until the hatching stage. these results suggest that the regulatory mechanism of 1a transcription in the embryonic stage is different from that after the hatching stage, and that this novel motif must be responsible for the embryonic stage expression of pmp <dig> 

the dna-binding domains of several transcription factors and short dna sequences for transcription factor binding are usually conserved in animal genomes  <cit> . comparison of the corresponding genome regions between fishes and mammals is useful for identification of functionally conserved sequences. we have successfully found novel conserved non-coding motifs , however further studies are necessary to fully understand pmp <dig> expression.

CONCLUSIONS
we investigated the relation of pmp <dig> transcription level with pns pathophysiology in medaka fish. similar to the mammalian cmt1a phenotype caused by pmp <dig> over-expression, reduction in peripheral ncv and aberrant myelin formation were observed in the pmp <dig> over-expression fish, having two fold higher transcription of ol_pmp <dig>  these results suggest that the contribution of adequate pmp <dig> expression in pns is common among jawed vertebrates. moreover, we elucidated the structural conservation of the gene among human, rodent and medaka fish, and found novel conserved non-coding motifs. these results indicate that the common ancestor for jawed vertebrates had acquired myelin formation with the associated gene functions including pmp <dig> and it has been conserved in present species.
