BACKGROUND
case study disease: fetal alcohol syndrome
fetal alcohol syndrome  is the most common preventable cause of mental retardation globally, and is a serious public health problem in south africa  <cit> . the range of prevalence rates reported in two different primary school cohorts from this community were  <dig> – <dig>  per  <dig>  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> – <dig>  per  <dig>  <cit>  respectively. this rate is alarmingly higher than the average observed for the developed world of  <dig>  per  <dig> live births  <cit> .

the teratogenic effect of alcohol is well established and exposure to alcohol in utero is known to result in a widely variable phenotype. fetal alcohol spectrum disorder  is an umbrella term used to describe the irreversible array of anomalies associated with in utero alcohol exposure  <cit> . these anomalies include prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, central nervous system  dysfunction, characteristic craniofacial malformation and other organ abnormalities  <cit> . the term fas is a clinical description for children at the most severe end of the fasd spectrum, who display the full phenotype associated with in utero alcohol exposure.

although alcohol consumption during pregnancy is the primary trigger for the presentation of fas, the exact mechanisms for alcohol-induced teratogenic effects have not been elucidated. research has shown that secondary factors, like genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors influence the outcome and severity of the disorder. furthermore, a dose- and time-dependant relationship has been observed, where exposure to higher concentrations of alcohol at critical developmental stages resulted in more severe anomalies  <cit> . an association between a variable genetic background and fas development is primarily supported by the observation that fas does not occur in all children exposed to alcohol during the prenatal period  <cit> . this observation suggests that certain individuals may have a genetic predisposition to infliction of more severe damage by gestational alcohol consumption; and the varied phenotype observed in fasd may be a reflection of the varied susceptibility quotients in the genetic background of the individual. streissguth and dehaene  <cit>  studied twin pairs with alcoholic mothers, and found the rate of concordance for fasd to be 100% for monozygotic twins, whereas digygotic twins showed only 64% concordance. further support for the role of genetics in fas development is obtained from animal model studies  <cit> . several studies in different mouse strains have shown variation in the extent and pattern of alcohol-induced malformation, as well as behavioural outcome  <cit> . fas can therefore be considered to be a multi-factorial or complex disease, suggesting that there are multiple genetic factors underlying susceptibility to fas and the interactions between these factors as well as other factors are likely to be intricate.

disease gene identification for fas
to date, no fas family linkage studies or genome wide association studies have been performed. linkage studies require large family samples and this poses a significant challenge. countries with the highest fas rates are mostly resource-poor, possibly contributing to the reason why such studies have not yet been performed. furthermore, linkage studies have not proven to be particularly successful in discovering the genetic causes of complex diseases, the critical factor being the generally weak genotype-phenotype association in multi-factorial disorders  <cit> .

few candidate gene association studies investigating the effect of specific genetic polymorphisms on the risk of fas development have been published. these studies have generally focused on the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme family members and conflicting results have been obtained. stoler et al.  <cit>  observed that the absence of the adh1b* <dig> allele was protective for fetal outcome, in conflict with two other studies showing the presence of this allele to be protective  <cit> . the adh1b* <dig> allele has been proposed to play a possible protective role, or to be a marker for protection in the south african mixed-ancestry population  <cit> . however, the sample size for this association study was small, and results have not yet been replicated in other populations. many other genes are likely to contribute towards the development of fas and further investigation is required.

candidate gene association studies remain the most practical and frequently employed approach in disease gene investigation for complex disorders. however, the main challenge when using this approach is to select suitable genes to test, especially for diseases with poorly understood aetiology. recently, many computational candidate gene selection and -prioritization methods have been developed  <cit> . these tools aim to identify and prioritize putative disease genes by modelling specific characteristics of known disease genes, or by focusing on known disease features . however, there is a vast quantity of information and data sources available currently, and it is expected that a tool with the flexibility to include a large array of data sources would positively aid disease gene discovery. the freely accessible tool endeavour offers such an application  <cit> . this tool is based on the premise of ranking unknown candidate genes according to their similarity with a known set of training genes. in the absence of a linked genetic region , all genes in the genome must be included as a starting point for candidate gene selection, which is not feasible when using this approach.

convergent functional genomics  is an approach used to identify and prioritize candidate genes, which  relies on the cross-matching of animal model gene expression data with human genetic linkage data, as well as human tissue data and biological roles data  <cit>  this approach has many parallels to the approach described in this paper, as it prescribes a bayesian-like methodology of reducing uncertainty through the combination of multiple independent lines of evidence, each by itself lacking sufficient power to confirm that a gene is a putative candidate gene, to produce a short list of high probability candidate genes  <cit> . the approach of cfg relies principally on two lines of evidence – animal model data and human genetic linkage data. the approach we describe in this paper has the added advantage of allowing the inclusion of additional lines of evidence in the presence of limited expression studies in an animal model and the absence of fas linkage studies.

tiffin et al.  <cit>  recently surveyed some of the methods for computational disease gene identification and concluded that using the methods in concert was more successful in prioritizing candidate genes for disease, than when each was used alone. this review additionally showed that using existing computational methods in concert highlighted potential candidates that are selected by a subset of methods and are missed by the other methods, depending on the type of data examined. this observation gives further evidence that the inclusion of more data sources may positively aid disease gene discovery.

in light of the current burden of fas in many resource-poor communities and the inconclusive search for susceptibility genes, computational identification offers a novel and efficient approach to the identification of disease-causing genes. initially we used the candidate gene selection method described by tiffin et al.  <cit> , but in the absence of a candidate genetic region, this method resulted in a large candidate gene list, as it relies on the selection of candidate disease genes only according to their expression profiles. this prompted us to devise a new prioritization method to rank genes from the candidate gene list for empirical investigation. the prioritization method described here is based on a simulation of a researcher's approach to selecting candidate disease genes. in this process, a variety of relevant database sources are mined for candidate genes that exhibit characteristics relevant to disease phenotype. genes were prioritized based on binary evaluation, where genes were assessed using criteria pertinent to fas to mine various database sources and to create criteria-specific gene lists. the validity of the binary prioritization method was assessed by investigating the protein-protein interactions, functional enrichment and common promoter element binding sites of the top-ranked genes.

RESULTS
integrated literature- and data mining for candidate gene selection
according to the method described by tiffin et al.  <cit> , dragon disease explorer  was used to extract evoc anatomical terms from the body of literature, where after they were used to extract candidate genes from the ensembl database. this method extracted a list of  <dig> genes, a reduction of  <dig> % from the original  <dig> genes in the ensembl database.

binary filtering and prioritization of candidate genes
in order to select the most likely candidates from the initial candidate gene list, these genes were ranked according to the number of additional criteria  they matched. the top-ranked genes  are shown in table  <dig>  fgfr <dig> was the top-ranked gene, present in  <dig> of the  <dig> criteria gene lists, followed by msx <dig>  present in  <dig> of the  <dig> criteria lists. fgfr <dig>  foxg1b and hoxa <dig> were present in  <dig> of the  <dig> criteria lists, followed by a group of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes present in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> criteria lists, respectively. this group of  <dig> genes was used as the prioritized candidate gene list for further analyses . this cut off  was used to select an appropriately-sized group of top-ranked genes.

genes from the candidate gene lists that matched one or none of the criteria were considered to be unlikely candidates. based on this premise, these  <dig> genes  from the candidate gene list were ranked as weak candidates.  <dig> genes of the subset matching to no criteria were randomly selected for further analysis as a negative control set to assess the validity of the ranking method.

protein-protein interactions
the list of most likely candidate genes , and unlikely candidates  were submitted to the string database   <cit>  to assess known protein-protein interactions. although the string database has information related to known and predicted protein-protein interactions, only known interactions were selected for this analysis, for accuracy. figure  <dig> shows the string network of interactions for the top-ranked genes. the network view summarizes the associations for the group of gene products. the network edges represent the predicted functional associations and each colour represents a different line of evidence. for the genes that were found to be linked through protein-protein interaction, the source of evidence for the interactions and confidence scores are summarized in table  <dig>  significantly fewer protein-protein interactions were observed within the low-ranked gene list.

the available evidence for the most significant interactions as well as the confidence score assigned for the interactions are shown

functional enrichment analysis using david
david   <cit>  was used to assess functional enrichment within the top-ranked candidate gene list. firstly, the analysis focusing on pathway maps highlighted a number of pathways significantly represented within the gene list, with the transforming growth factor  signalling pathway being most over-represented within the list . this enrichment was not observed on the low-ranked gene list . furthermore, significant enrichment of gene ontology  terms was observed in the top-ranked list for all three of the go – categories. the go terms found to be significantly enriched for the top-ranked gene list are shown in additional file  <dig> 

the gene count indicates how many genes from a particular pathway were present in the candidate gene list of  <dig> genes. note that varying p-values were obtained depending on the background list used

promoter element binding site analysis
as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the promoter analysis detected  <dig> transcription factors  that appear in promoter elements  or pairs of pe that are significantly statistically enriched in the target promoter set as opposed to the background set. the conditions for selection pe of tables  <dig> and  <dig> were that pe  has to appear in at least 5% of promoters in the target set and to have over-representation index   of at least  <dig>  these are ap- <dig>  c/ebp, e2f, etf, lef <dig>  maz, mazr, mzf <dig>  pax- <dig>  sp <dig>  spz <dig>  tata, tfii-i, vdr, zf <dig>  in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  pe or their combinations that have been found in significantly enriched proportions relative to the background promoter set, are denoted by a + sign in the column of the over-representation index . further analysis suggests that tf that potentially bind these transcription factor binding sites , are part of the group of tf that are dominant transcriptional regulators of our promoter target set . results from the promoter element binding site analysis are shown in additional file  <dig> 

the criteria for selecting pe as enriched was that it has to appear in at least 5% of the target promoter sequences and to have over-representation index  of at least  <dig>  pe that appear in statistically significant proportion in the target set are denoted by + in the ori column.

discussion
our challenge was to select a highly likely group of candidate genes for susceptibility to fas, in the absence of genetic linkage evidence. in this paper a computational approach to candidate disease gene identification is proposed as an effective first line of candidate gene identification for a complex disease such as fas. mining of gene expression data was used to generate an extensive list of candidate genes which were compared to filtered criteria specific gene lists using  <dig> criteria to select the most likely candidate genes. the prioritization method described here is based on a computational model of a researcher's approach to selecting candidate genes, i.e. based on published information; but may also select non-intuitive candidate genes. in summary, various relevant database sources are accessed to establish whether a candidate gene and its product exhibit the biological characteristics consistent with that particular disease.

candidate gene selection and -prioritization
a method that employs an integrative literature- and data mining approach to select candidate genes was used to select candidate genes for fas  <cit> . this method extracted a gene list of  <dig> genes. this list is relatively unspecific, and is likely to have a high false-positive rate. the most plausible explanation for the selection of such a large, ambiguous list is a lack of detailed information about the source of cdna libraries, with the result that more general terms from higher up the ontology hierarchy are often used for annotation of the gene. this prompted us to devise a prioritization method to rank genes from the candidate gene list using many different data sources for laboratory investigation of individual candidate genes. a binary evaluation method was used to rank the candidate genes in the list, facilitating the selection of  <dig> top-ranked genes as the most likely candidate genes for further investigation.

further analysis with available online tools such as david and string highlighted protein-protein interaction, functional enrichment and probable biological significance among the top-ranked genes. string was used to investigate protein-protein interaction among the prioritized candidate genes, and highlighted a group of genes that interact . the candidate gene selection method described here focuses on gene annotation, and it is therefore possible that the top ranking genes are better annotated than low-ranked genes. therefore the absence of protein-protein interaction among the low-ranked genes is not necessarily a reflection on level of interaction but may be related to the level of understanding of the gene and its function. it is accepted that the genes underlying complex disease  will be plentiful and the interactions between these factors are likely to be intricate. for this reason, string is a useful tool to highlight genes within the top-ranked gene list that interact and that may have a cooperative effect on disease outcome.

david elucidates functional enrichment and biological significance within the top-ranked gene list, and highlighted the tgf-β and mitogen-activated protein kinase  signalling pathways as primary candidate pathways for fas development.

as a way of further assessing the list of  <dig> prioritized fas candidate genes they were cross-matched against candidate genes for alcoholism, obtained using convergent functional genomics  <cit> . although the two phenotypes are very different, one would expect some overlap in prioritized candidate genes since many of the mothers of fas children suffer from alcoholism. the two prioritized candidate gene lists  had only two high priority candidate genes in common – gnas complex locus  and high mobility group protein b <dig> . the remaining  <dig> candidate genes for alcoholism were also present in the initially selected list of  <dig> genes, but were ranked below the arbitrary cut-off of 11/ <dig> criteria used to select the highly prioritized candidate list for fas.

incorporating the set of alcoholism genes as a selection criterion into the binary evaluation method only added two more genes to the prioritized list. these were g1/s-specific cyclin-d <dig>  and insulin-like growth factor i receptor . both gene products contribute to cell proliferation and differentiation, and exhibit characteristics that also make them likely candidate genes for fas. however, neither directly interacts in the two main prioritized pathways . this comparison shows that these two related diseases  have potentially common genetic factors, but that they also exhibit diversity in terms of genetic susceptibility. this gene list was therefore not included in the final binary filtering analysis.

prioritized pathways – relevance to fas development
tgf-β signalling pathway
fas is a complex disease, suggesting that the genetic factors underlying susceptibility to fas may be plentiful and the interactions between these factors, as well as environmental factors are likely to be intricate. the computational approach described here highlights genes that are important players in various signalling pathways, in particular the tgf-β and mapk pathways. these genes play pivotal roles during embryogenesis and development  and have a potential role in the distinct characteristics associated with fas, i.e. cns dysfunction, craniofacial abnormalities and growth retardation. cns dysfunction is the most severe and permanent consequence of in utero alcohol exposure and the only feature present in all other disorders in fasd. these observations make the tgf-β signalling pathway an interesting focus point, as it is essential in both fetal development and also cns development  <cit> .

tgf-β signalling controls a diverse array of cellular processes, including cell proliferation and apoptosis, cell differentiation and specification of cellular phenotypes and developmental fate  <cit> . tgf-β is also important in neuronal migration and axonal growth, and regulates the formation of various craniofacial structures  <cit> .

early exposure to ethanol inhibits such tgf-β regulated processes as cortical cell proliferation and neuronal migration, disrupts axonal growth and up-regulates cell adhesion molecule expression  <cit> . it can therefore be suggested that members of the tgf-β signalling pathway interact with ethanol, and/or its metabolic breakdown products, and that ethanol may have a detrimental effect on the efficiency of this developmentally essential pathway. investigating the role of tgf-β components present among the top-ranked genes may clarify part of the genetic component contributing to susceptibility for fas development.

the hypothesis that tgf-β signalling pathway genes may be involved in fas susceptibility is even more compelling when considering the major role of this pathway in neuronal apoptosis. several studies have shown that alcohol suppresses neuronal activity, resulting in a pro-apoptotic environment in the developing brain  <cit> . alcohol-induced neural apoptosis has been observed throughout the developing cns, including all levels of the spinal cord, brain stem, cerebellum, midbrain and forebrain. furthermore, alcohol has been observed to diminish neurons from various parts of the developing visual-, auditory- and memory systems of the developing brain  <cit> . this pro-apoptotic effect of alcohol provides a probable explanation for the long-term cns dysfunction and diminished brain size associated with fas, and could be mediated by the tgf-β pathway. alcohol has an array of molecular pathway targets and modes of inducing apoptosis and the candidate disease genes selected using this method have a strong role to play in apoptosis.

genetic mutations in members of the tgf-β signal pathway, generally result in tumorigenesis, and have been repeatedly linked to human cancer  <cit>  tgf-β dysfunction is also causal for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia  <cit> , corneal dystrophy  <cit> , camurati-engelmann disease of bone  <cit>  glomerulonephritis  <cit> , scar formation  <cit> , keloids  <cit> , pulmonary fibrosis  <cit> , and liver cirrhosis  <cit> . recent studies also propose a role for tgf-β signalling in alzheimer's disease pathology  <cit> . however, no such link has to date been proposed between genetic susceptibility to fas development and disruption of the tgf-β pathway. given the above-mentioned experimental evidence, the tgf-β pathway, and specifically its components that were top-ranked using this computational approach, is an attractive focus for a genetic association study.

mapk signalling pathway
the mapk pathway transmits a large variety of external signals, leading to a wide range of cellular responses, including growth, differentiation, inflammation and apoptosis  <cit> . this pathway is very complex and includes many protein components. mapk-pathway components have been shown to be involved in both the initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and post-mitotic functions, and in cell differentiation by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors  <cit> .

the mapk signalling pathway can be activated by a variety of stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines and differentiation factors  <cit>  as well as external stress factors, such as alcohol  <cit> . recent studies have investigated the effect of controlling second-messenger signalling on neuronal migration in a mouse model of fas  <cit> . it was shown that experimental manipulation of these second-messenger pathways, through stimulating calcium- and cgmp signalling or inhibiting camp signalling, completely reversed the action of ethanol on neuronal migration in vitro as well as in vivo. each investigated second messenger had multiple but distinct downstream targets, including mapk.

hedgehog signalling pathway
the hedgehog signalling pathway also received a highly significant ranking among the pathways identified to be enriched within the candidate list. the hedgehog signalling pathway is a key regulator of embryonic development and is highly conserved. knock-out mouse models lacking components of this pathway have been observed to develop malformations in the cns, musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal tract and lungs  <cit> .

fas animal models portray a strikingly similar craniofacial phenotype to mouse models treated with antibodies that block hedgehog signalling components, specifically the sonic hedgehog  molecule  <cit>  further studies to expose the role of shh in fetal alcohol syndrome, showed that alcohol resulted in a significant decrease in shh levels in the developing embryo, as well as a decrease in the level of other transcripts involved in shh signalling. furthermore it was observed that the addition of shh after ethanol treatment led to fewer apoptotic cranial neural crest cells, resulting in a significant decrease in craniofacial anomalies  <cit> . these results give compelling support that the components of the hedgehog signalling pathway may also be important in the genetics of fas.

transcriptional regulators of the prioritised genes
all tfbs that are found to be statistically significant for fas are known to be involved in gene expression and regulation in the cns, endocrine system or development. the ap- <dig> family of tf is crucial for neural gene expression and neuronal development  <cit> ; c/ebp is involved in neuronal signalling  <cit> ; the e2f family of tf is one of the key controllers of cell-cycle and has a known role in pathways controlling neuron death  <cit> ; etf, the epidermal growth factor receptor-specific tf, is implicated in neuroblastoma  <cit> ; lef <dig> is expressed in the nerve system of mammals  <cit> ; maz is involved in hodgkin's disease and paraneoplastic cerebellar dysfunction  <cit>  and during neuronal differentiation  <cit> ; mazr is implicated in the development of mouse limb buds  <cit> ; mzf <dig> is involved in development  <cit>  and implicated in the control of the bace <dig> gene related to alzheimer's disease  <cit> ; pax- <dig> is involved in the endocrine system and development  <cit> ; sp <dig> has multiple roles, but, for example, controls expression of na+,k+-atpase in neuronal cells  <cit> ; spz <dig> is involved in cell-proliferation  <cit> ; tata binding proteins are implicated in various processes involved in brain  <cit> ; the tfii-i transcription factor family is implicated in craniofacial development of humans and mice  <cit> ; vdr is associated with increased risk of schizophrenia  <cit> ; and zf <dig> is implicated in neuroblastoma differentiation  <cit> . these results support the prioritization of biologically relevant candidate disease genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained in this study suggest that making a clinically-informed selection from the evidence obtained from literature- and database-mining is an effective approach for candidate disease gene selection and -prioritization. the main limitation of this approach is that it is primarily based on gene annotation, and that it is therefore biased towards selecting better annotated genes. furthermore, some clinical understanding of the disease aetiology is needed to aid the clinically-informed binary evaluation, and this process could be partly subjective and researcher-specific. the effectiveness of this approach critically depends on the disease under investigation being clearly defined both molecularly and physiologically, in order to avoid erroneous associations. a multitude of biological processes are affected by the insult of alcohol exposure, particularly given a predisposing genetic background. fas as a developmental disorder represents with a spectrum of structural, behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, which complicates this process of clearly defining focus. this is evident when considering the ambiguous results obtained when using the method that only considers general anatomical terms to select candidate genes  <cit> . this encouraged the inclusion of the binary prioritization technique to further enhance the selection process.

a further limitation of employing this approach in selecting candidate genes for a developmental disorder lies in the limited knowledge available regarding the mechanisms involved in such a disorder. the developing organism undergoes many rounds of pattern formation, generating complexity with each ensuing round of cell division and with cell differentiation. even though the pathways identified using this technique are general fundamental role players in embryogenesis and development, the technique allowed the focus to fall on specific candidate genes within these pathways for investigation.

the computational approach described here has been used to select and refine a 'most likely' candidate gene list according to known characteristics of fas. we have demonstrated that we can identify likely candidates that are biologically relevant to the disease, and therefore appropriate for gene association studies. by refining the candidate gene list for fas using a binary evaluation approach, we selected a subset of biologically relevant candidate genes for experimental validation.
