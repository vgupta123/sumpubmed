BACKGROUND
higher eukaryotic translation elongation factor eef1a operates in translation cycles by directing the correct aminoacyl-trna to the a site of mrna-programmed ribosome  <cit> . a further translational function could be the interaction of eef1a with deacylated trna coupled with direct transfer of trna in the channeled elongation steps of mammalian translation  <cit> . besides its role in translation, eef1a is involved in other cellular processes such as carcinogenesis and apoptosis and can interact with a large number of non-translational ligands in the cell  <cit> . there are two tissue and developmental-specific isoforms of eef1a, which are 93% identical and 98% similar  <cit> . importantly, despite the strong similarity of sequence at the amino acid level, the isoforms appear to differ in some properties and functions, which are both related and unrelated to translation. for example, the eef1a <dig> isoform has a higher affinity for gdp than for gtp, whilst the affinity of eef1a <dig> for these ligands is similar  <cit> . in the presence of eef1a <dig> an inhibition of apoptotic processes was observed, whilst the opposite was found for eef1a <dig>  <cit> . importantly, the appearance of eef1a <dig> in tissues in which the variant is not normally expressed can be coupled to cancer development, as shown for ovary and suggested in some cases of breast cancer  <cit> . importantly, eef1a <dig> serves as a housekeeping protein in the same tissues and seemingly is not related to the cancer in these cases. the structural peculiarities which underlay the cancer specificity of eef1a <dig> remain unknown. the eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> isoforms contain  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues respectively with  <dig> replacements and a sole deletion of the penultimate residue in eef1a <dig> . eef1a <dig> has seven modified residues: n-trimethyllysines   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  n-dimethyllysines   <dig> and  <dig>  l-glutamyl 5-glycerylphosphorylethanolamines   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the eef1a <dig> molecule is characterized by four modified residues , however, complete analysis of the eef1a <dig> post-translation modifications is lacking  <cit> . since the functional difference of the isoforms cannot be attributed to the any amino acid substitutions at our current level of knowledge, we reasoned that the background for the functional difference of eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> might lie in changes of spatial structure of the proteins.

higher eukaryotic eef1a has so far been resistant to attempts to crystallize it, so x-ray analysis is available only for the complex of yeast eef1a with the truncated gdp exchange subunit eef1ba  <cit> . the identity of yeast and human eef1a is more than 80%, so we modeled the spatial structures of human eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> using this x-ray structure as the main template. not surprisingly, no meaningful difference in the static structures of eef1a <dig>  and eef1a <dig>  was found by this approach. in spite of this, it was tempting to analyze the molecular dynamics  of the isoforms. in this case, initial models similar for both isoforms could be developed in the course of md simulation into noticeably different conformations of the eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> molecules.

complete conformational sampling for a three-domain protein may require an md trajectory of a relatively long time scale. however, the protein can adopt denatured forms during simulation, and if the only trajectory is available, the denatured state can be interpreted as the native conformation in solution. moreover, statistical errors accumulate at long md calculation. in view of the aforesaid, an alternative, multiple md simulation method  <cit>  has been used. the method consists of the simulation of several relatively short md trajectories starting from the same initial protein conformation with different initial atom velocities. multiple md simulation permits a reduction of computational time, a widening of the statistical basis, and allows us to evaluate quality of single trajectories and minimize force-field induced artifacts  <cit> .

our multiple md simulation studies demonstrated more inter-domain mobility of the eef1a <dig> molecule when compared to eef1a <dig>  at the same time eef1a <dig> was characterized by a higher internal mobility of the structural domains. amino acid residues were determined, for which flexibility is evidently different in the isoforms. some significant md characteristics inherent to both isoforms were also revealed; in particular, fluctuation of the eef1a molecule between "open" and "closed" conformations in solution was shown providing for the first time a description of the dynamic behavior of human eef1a in solution. importantly, a difference in putative calmodulin binding sites of the isoforms has been predicted. the data obtained are an essential step in the move towards an understanding of the functional divergence of the near-identical eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> isoforms, and in particular, the cancer-related properties of the latter.

RESULTS
the models consist of three domains . the first domain contains  <dig> β-strands , which form the β-sheet surrounded by  <dig> α-helices . the second domain is the β-barrel formed by the strands leu248-leu <dig>  asp252-ile <dig>  gly260-val <dig>  met276-ala <dig>  val/ile285-val <dig>  ser291-met <dig>  glu297-leu <dig>  asp306-val <dig> and asn324-ser <dig>  the third domain is also in the β-barrel consisting of β-strands gly/gln339-leu <dig>  tyr357-cys <dig>  ala366-asp <dig>  lys385-gly/asn <dig>  asp398-gly <dig>  gly422-asp <dig> and gln431-asp/glu <dig>  in the present study the residues up to pro <dig> are attributed to domain i, because pro <dig> is the last residue from the continuous series of residues in the unstructured chain cys234-arg <dig>  which are situated within the distance of the van der waals radii sum to a residue from the other chain of the domain i . similarly, pro <dig> is the first residue from the chain cys234-arg <dig>  which is within the distance of the van der waals radii sum from a residue of other chain of the domain ii , so pro <dig> is chosen as the first residue of the domain ii. ser <dig> is the end of the domain ii because it is the last residue in the asn324-ser <dig> β-strand. domain iii starts with met/gln <dig>  which is situated within the distance of the van der waals radii sum from a residue of other chain of the domain iii . domains i and iii and also domains ii and iii are situated tightly one to another, while a voluminous space exists between domains i and ii. the space is limited by loop arg69-leu <dig> from the side of domain i and by residues his295-gly <dig> from the side of domain ii.

in contrast to the full protein rmsd, the rmsds of separate domains show more scattering  for eef1a <dig> than for eef1a <dig>  so, the internal motions of the domains are larger in the eef1a <dig> molecule. the difference in mobility of the two protein variants is mostly observed for domain iii . one may conclude that domain iii of eef1a <dig> moves in solution more away from the initial conformation than the same domain of eef1a <dig>  thus, for eef1a <dig> an increased mobility of the entire protein  while for eef1a <dig> an elevated mobility of individual domains  are detected.

the distance between centers of the domains was calculated  to directly analyze the inter-domain mobility of the isoforms. a direct link between the full protein rmsd and the distance between the domains i and ii is observed for eef1a <dig>  the trajectories characterized by the maximal rmsd for the full protein   demonstrate the smallest distance between domains i and ii . similarly, the trajectories with the minimal rmsd  show the maximal distance between the domains i and ii. consequently, the departure of eef1a <dig> from the initial conformation is accompanied by the approaching of domains i and ii.

the correlation for eef1a <dig> is less obvious. thus, trajectory  <dig> demonstrating the maximal full protein rmsd is characterized by the minimal distance between the domains i and ii , but trajectory  <dig> which displays the elevated full protein rmsd is characterized by the largest distance between domains i and ii. so, for both variants the correspondence between the maximal rmsd and the minimal distance between the domains i and ii is conserved, while the correlation of the minimal rmsd and the maximal distance between the domains is valid only for eef1a <dig>  this confirms that the full protein rmsd scattering for eef1a <dig> is determined mainly by the reciprocal motions of the domains i and ii, whereas the rmsd scattering for eef1a <dig> is determined both by the inter-domain and internal domain motions.

the average distance between domains i and ii is less for eef1a <dig> . the distance between the domains is decreased with simulation time for all trajectories of eef1a <dig> , while for eef1a <dig> the abatement is less substantial and is not observed for trajectories  <dig> and  <dig> .

the distances between domains i and iii and between domains ii and iii change less significantly than distance between domains i and ii for both isoforms. however, increased scattering  of the distance between domains i and iii for eef1a <dig> as compared to eef1a <dig> should be noted .

interestingly, eef1a <dig> has more inter-domain mobility but less average distance between domains i and ii, while eef1a <dig> is characterized by lower inter-domain mobility but a larger average distance between the first and second domains. for both protein variants the average protein conformation is characterized by less distance between domains i and ii as compared to the initial model. in the course of simulation the distance between the domains decreases frequently and increases only rarely. that is why the lower average distance between domains i and ii might be characteristic of a protein with higher inter-domain mobility.

the increased proximity of the domains i and ii causes a decrease of the gap between the domains, i.e. between chains arg69-leu <dig> of the domain i and his295-gly <dig> of domain ii . the minimal distance between the chains decreases up to van der waals radii sum for trajectories  <dig> and  <dig>  of eef1a <dig>  and for trajectories  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  of eef1a <dig>  indicating the formation of a "completely closed" conformation. this conformation is characterized by a high full protein rmsd with respect to the initial protein conformation and by a large number of contacts between the arg69-leu <dig> and his295-gly <dig> groups.

the proteins can oscillate from an extended to a compact conformation and vice versa. for example, trajectory  <dig> moves to a "closed" conformation of a protein at  <dig> ps, then returns to an "open" conformation at  <dig> ps, and again transforms into a "closed" one at  <dig> ps . trajectories  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> adopt a "closed" conformation of a protein only for a short time at 8500– <dig>  6350– <dig> and 7500– <dig> ps, respectively . critically, it has been demonstrated recently by small angle neutron scattering experiments that eef1a <dig> adopts an "extended" conformation in solution, becoming more compact in the presence of trna  <cit> . thus, one may suggest that the short-lived "closed" conformation of eef1a found by md simulation analysis can be stabilized by its biological ligands.

importantly, the distance between the domains i and ii remains closer for eef1a <dig> than for eef1a <dig> even after omitting from the calculations the trajectories which adopt a "closed" conformation for more than  <dig> ps  . thus, the average distance between domains i and ii is less in the eef1a <dig> than in eef1a <dig> "open" conformations. since the region of the cleft between the domains i and ii could be important for trna binding, at least for prokaryotic ef-tu  <cit> , it is reasonable to assume that the trna affinity for eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> could differ.

to describe the correlated motions of the protein domains, a covariance analysis of cα-atoms was performed . trajectories  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> for eef1a <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> for eef1a <dig> were chosen as the most stable trajectories by cα-atoms rmsd matrices. it was determined that the ranges 2500– <dig>  5440– <dig>  3960– <dig>  1070– <dig>  3780– <dig> and 1130– <dig> ps chosen for trajectories  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively, contain protein conformations with minimal rmsds with respect to each other. the eigenvalues and cosine contents for projections of the trajectories onto first eight eigenvectors are listed in table  <dig>  table  <dig> shows that the principal components are well defined for the trajectory  <dig> of eef1a <dig>  for other trajectories and especially for the trajectory  <dig> of eef1a <dig> the cosine content for the eigenvector  <dig> is relatively high, so the estimations of the correlated motions for these trajectories are more approximate. in fact, this may provide further evidence that eef1a <dig> has more intra-domain non-correlated diffusive motions than eef1a <dig> 

as can be seen from figure  <dig>  the main correlated motions for both isoforms are characterized by an increased proximity of the domains i and ii  and by rotation of the structural domains around diverse axes. the domain ii and "top" part of domain i  are most movable. in a number of cases "top" part of the domain i moves independently from the remaining part of the domain i . in some cases the domains ii and iii rotate as a single whole around the same axis .

thus, we conclude that the main correlated motions of the two eef1a isoforms are similar: the coming together of the domain ii and the "top" part of domain i as well as rotation of structural domains.

to characterize the random, non-correlated motions of cα-atoms, the rmsf of these atoms were calculated for the separate domains in the  <dig> ps trajectory ranges: 4000– <dig> ps for trajectories  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  1110– <dig> ps for trajectory  <dig> and 3920– <dig> ps for trajectory  <dig>  the data were averaged for each variant . figure  <dig> a demonstrates that the maximal flexibility of cα-atoms is typical for the loops, the "top" part of the domain i and the "bottom" of domain iii . the residues for which a difference between the rmsf of eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> is more than  <dig>  nm are labeled in red in figure 2b, while residues with the negative difference less than - <dig>  nm are labeled in blue.

calmodulin binding
the importance of the data obtained for providing an explanation of the possible functional dissimilarity of the isoforms can be demonstrated by analysis of the putative calmodulin binding site. it is known that plant and tetrahymena eef1a are calmodulin-binding proteins  <cit> . amino acid residues asn311-gly <dig>  gly422-val <dig> in eef1a <dig> and arg427-val <dig> in eef1a <dig>  are predicted by the calmodulin target database  program  <cit>  to be a possible calmodulin-binding site of human eef1a. the amino acid residues comprising putative calmodulin binding site are well conserved from human to yeast , this finding is in line with functional importance of the site.

the asn311-gly <dig> motif is situated in domain ii and contains an unfolded loop lys313-gly <dig> flanked by parts of neighboring β-strands. because the val325-gly <dig> region has no solvent accessible surface, only residues asn311-asn <dig> could participate in calmodulin binding if no essential conformational changes of domain ii take place during protein-protein interaction.

it was recently suggested that calmodulin-binding motifs in a protein should be disordered or flanked by disordered regions, adopting the most appropriate conformation for interaction with calmodulin  <cit> . because region lys313-gly <dig> is disordered, the motif asn311-gly <dig> satisfies the criterion for calmodulin-binding targets  <cit> .

on the other hand, the binding process is most favorable by entropy when the protein loses a minimal number of degrees of freedom, i.e. when the binding motif has minimal diffusive non-correlated motions before the binding. thus, ordered regions such as α-helices flanked by disordered regions reveal an especially high inclination for calmodulin binding  <cit> . figure 5b ii shows that residues val315-val <dig> are more flexible in eef1a <dig> than in eef1a <dig> . besides, the cα-atoms rmsds of the motif asn311-gly <dig> during the fitting of domain ii to the initial conformation are more scattered in eef1a <dig> than in eef1a <dig> , so the diffusive motions of the motif residues are larger in the second isoform. thus, the region asn311-gly <dig> could bind calmodulin more tightly in eef1a <dig> than in eef1a <dig> 

as for the second putative calmodulin-binding motif, the region of gly422-val <dig> is situated on the interface between domains i and iii and comprises a β-hairpin. the region is essentially buried and only residues arg427-gln <dig> have enough surface area accessible for interaction with other proteins. therefore we believe the motif gly422-val <dig> has limited ligand binding capacity which, however, can be increased in the case of essential changes in the mutual orientation of domains i and iii. because inter-domain mobility is larger in eef1a <dig> , the reorientation of such domains is more likely to happen in that isoform. furthermore, less significant diffusive mobility of asp <dig> in eef1a <dig>  should favor higher calmodulin-binding ability of that isoform.

thus, the md simulation analysis predicts that eef1a <dig> isoform should have increased affinity for calmodulin.

the ability of eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> to bind calmodulin was examined experimentally. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay was used to compare calmodulin-binding properties of the isoforms. eef1a <dig> or eef1a <dig> were pre-absorbed in the wells of a microtiter plate and ca2+-calmodulin was added to compete with anti-eef1a antibodies. if calmodulin binding to eef1a challenges antibody binding the absorbance value is decreased in the presence of calmodulin. ca2+-calmodulin was found to interact with the eef1a <dig> isoform only , thus validating the md simulation prediction. the binding of ca2+-calmodulin to the eef1a <dig> isoform was concentration dependent and observed at a 6-fold molar excess of calmodulin over eef1a <dig>  importantly, no ca2+-calmodulin interaction with eef1a <dig> was detected even at 30-fold excess of the ligand. anti-eef1a antibodies did not show any affinity for ca2+-calmodulin. the addition of ca2+ alone  to compete with anti-eef1a antibodies did not interfere with the absorbance.

CONCLUSIONS
the dynamic behavior of eef1a – one of the main protein components of the human translation machinery – has been described for the first time. the existence of a reversible transition between "open" and "close" conformations of eef1a gives a molecular background for the demonstrated earlier ability of eef1a to change shape upon interaction with trna.

we showed how a tiny divergence in the amino acid sequences of the protein variants possessing 98% similarity could still lead to changes of the spatial structure and dynamics of the isoforms.

different affinity of the eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> isoforms for the important signaling protein calmodulin has been predicted by md data and demonstrated experimentally. thus, diverse dynamic structures of the isoforms could alter the types of interaction with signaling proteins. this finding gives important background information to consider in the context of specific cancer-related properties of eef1a <dig>  <cit> . experiments to inspect the md results by a number of biophysical and molecular biology methods are now in progress.
