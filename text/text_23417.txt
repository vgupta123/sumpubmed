BACKGROUND
the use of transgenic animals has helped to produce major advances in the field of functional genetics. typically, these experiments use only model organisms with known regulatory dna sequences, i.e. enhancers, that drive gene expression at particular times in development and in particular cells. but, while transposable elements such as piggybac have enabled transgenic manipulations of increasingly diverse organisms <cit> , the lack of versatile tools for genetic manipulations in these organisms has hindered their use in functional genetic experiments. specifically, there is a need to provide temporal and spatial control of transgene expression because it is known that within a developmental context, a gene expressed ubiquitously produces different effects than the same gene expressed in a more restricted pattern  <cit> .

in model organisms, dramatic genetic manipulations utilizing the widely used yeast gal4/uas system have increased our understanding of gene function  <cit> . as the field of functional genomics moves toward a more comparative framework however, the gal4/uas system has certain drawbacks that might limit its usefulness. traditionally, researchers must create extensive transgenic lines to bring the gal <dig> transcription factor under the control of an appropriate regulatory sequence. this is both time and labor intensive and requires maintenance of a large number of animal stocks. modifications to the traditional gal4/uas system can eliminate the requirement for specific gal <dig> lines but do not reproduce the precise spatial control of transgene expression <cit> .

inducible promoters are also utilized to misexpress genes in transgenic organisms. the hsp <dig> promoter is a popular inducible promoter in a variety of systems including invertebrates such as drosophila <cit>  and bombyx mori <cit> . while whole organismal heat stress is the most commonly used induction method for this promoter, researchers have found novel ways to provide temporal and spatial control of induction including heated needles <cit>  and laser systems. in particular, micro laser pulses of a modified cell ablation system were used to heat shock single cells and induce the hsp <dig> promoter in c. elegans <cit> , drosophila <cit>  and danio rerio <cit> . our study represents the first application of laser-mediated promoter induction to larger populations of cells, providing the fine level of spatial control necessary to replicate many of the elaborate expression patterns observed during development.

RESULTS
in order to develop this hsp70-laser induction method, we generated a piggybac construct that carried the drosophila hsp <dig> promoter driving the reporter gene egfp as well as the synthetic 3xp <dig> promoter driving dsred expression in the eyes as a transformation marker . this construct was then used for germ-line transformations of bicyclus as previously reported <cit> . f <dig> individuals were screened for dsred fluorescence in the adult eye . six putative transgenic individuals were isolated from separate populations and four were confirmed by pcr. the transformation rate was  <dig> %, which is similar to previous reports in lepidoptera  <cit> . one line  was established for use in all the heat shock experiments. southern blot characterization showed the j <dig> line carried a single insertion of the piggybac element . every generation, individuals were selected either for dsred expression, or egfp expression after a  <dig> h heat-shock at 39°c, in the eyes. initially, screens were also confirmed by pcr targeting the egfp gene using larval hemolymph samples <cit> .

we tested the function of the drosophila hsp <dig> promoter in bicyclus anynana using whole organismal heat shocks at several stages of development. animals were placed in a 39°c chamber for  <dig> to  <dig> hours. the animals were then moved to a 27°c chamber for at least  <dig> hours prior to visualization. egfp was detectable  <dig> to  <dig> hours after the onset of the heat shock. in larval samples, egfp was visible in the epidermis  and in the gut . in pupal samples, egfp was mostly visible in the dorsal region of the abdomen  but was visible in the wing epidermis upon dissection .

we then tested the ability of a laser  to induce hsp70-egfp expression in a simple line pattern in the epidermal cells of the pupal wing of transgenic butterflies  and wildtype controls . we observed green fluorescence in a subset of epidermal cells that corresponded to the treated area in  <dig> % of j <dig> individuals . given that the j <dig> line is not a pure homozygous line and that wild-type individuals are still segregating in the population, we believe this percentage underestimates the actual percentage of positive results in transgenic individuals. while most of the wild-type control animals showed no pattern of fluorescence , in  <dig> animals we observed some green autofluorescence from damaged cells. using a dye that reacts within membrane compromised cells to produce a blue fluorescent signal, we confirmed that the observed green fluorescence in treated j <dig> individuals was due to the presence of egfp . to eliminate the problem of autofluorescence in the green channel, laser-treated wings from both j <dig> and wild-type individuals were stained with a rabbit anti-egfp primary antibody and a texas-red conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody to shift the egfp signal to the red channel. in j <dig> individuals, a red line was observed that corresponded to the treated area while no signal was detected in wild-type individuals .

to determine the effect of the laser treatment on adult wings, we treated  <dig> transgenic and  <dig> wild-type individuals and allowed the adults to eclose. we then compared the wings of treated individuals to those of untreated controls. no pattern or vein disruptions were observed in any of the treated individuals.

in order to determine the spatial resolution of our laser system, we heat shocked cells in a variety of complex patterns produced using metal micro-stencils. for these experiments, the stencils replaced the metal slit in the center of the beam path . the average intensities were comparable to those of the previous experiment. we found that the laser treatment can produce complex patterns of egfp induction in the pupal wing , in distinct populations of cells separated by as few as  <dig> cell diameters .

given the tight control of gene expression possible with this system, we intend to utilize it to provide some of the first functional tests of the roles of candidate genes in the development of wing patterns in b. anynana. we do not feel that this system is restricted to this use and could easily be adapted to investigate gene function in a number of organisms and tissues including developing plant meristems, or epidermal stem cells in vertebrates. the wavelength we used in these initial experiments do produce some damage and cell death after  <dig> minutes of heat-shock, therefore, we are currently testing a new laser that uses lower energy wavelengths in the infrared spectrum.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that laser-mediated heat shocks can be used to induce the drosophila hsp <dig> promoter in groups of cells of the pupal wings of b. anynana. this technique will be useful to study gene function in other biological systems where transgenesis is possible but data on regulatory sequences is lacking. our method will allow researchers to test candidate genes in any tissue accessible to laser treatment with only the need of a compatible heat-shock promoter. the spatial and temporal control offered by this system is a powerful new tool to investigate various roles of a candidate gene's function in the ontogeny of an organism. in our research organism, b. anynana, the laser treatment did not alter the pattern of the adult wing allowing us to use this technique to test the function of candidate genes in color patterning the butterfly wing.
