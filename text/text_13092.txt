BACKGROUND
our understanding of the molecular, genetic basis of adaptations and phenotypic differentiation among individuals will advance quickly thanks to new molecular techniques. this understanding is crucial given that accelerating environmental change and human population growth are increasingly threatening natural populations of fish and wildlife as well as increasing demands for agricultural production in domesticated species. this makes it urgent in many wild and domestic species to investigate the genetic basis of fitness, adaptation, and disease resistance  <cit> , and to discover adaptive genes and speciation genes, i.e., the "loci of evolution"  <cit> .

understanding the genetic basis of phenotypes generally requires genotyping thousands of gene-targeted loci, genome-wide. despite the declining costs of next generation dna sequencing , it remains costly enough to prohibit analyzing large portions of genomes in numerous individuals as is required for population studies . fortunately, with coding gene sequences  comprising a mere 2% of the typical eukaryotic genome, and the development of techniques for isolating exome dna, re-sequencing coding portions genome-wide can be done at a reasonable per-sample cost, locating thousands of informative gene markers. because exon sequences are relatively conserved we hypothesized that most exons from one species  could be used to capture exons from another species for use in next generation sequencing for snp discovery.

exon capture enriches for exon dna by simultaneous hybridization of fragmented genomic dna from the study individual to many thousands of oligonucleotide probes  that are complementary to gene-coding  sequences. the captured fragments are then sequenced in parallel on next-generation sequencing platforms. exon capture has been tested almost exclusively in model species , typically baiting either the whole exome or a single chromosomal region. facilitated by availability of genome sequences for the target organism, such studies leave untested the potential application of exon capture to a wider variety of organisms. probe design for exome-wide capture requires knowledge of thousands of exon sequences. with few fully sequenced eukaryotic genome sequences available , it would appear to be useful for only a small proportion of eukaryotic species. even if  <dig>  vertebrate genomes are eventually sequenced  <cit> , there would still remain tens of thousands of vertebrate species without genome sequences or any genome resources.

here we show that the exon capture method has a more general application, reporting exon capture in two livestock species, bos taurus  and bos indicus , and one wildlife species, bison bison . we conducted all three captures through hybridization to sequences from the published bos taurus genome  <cit> . we baited a small genome-wide fraction of the exome, sampling exons in about 10% of the taurine genome's estimated minimum total of  <dig>  genes  <cit> . our results demonstrate that genetic divergence between a reference genome and individuals queried does not prohibit exome-wide identification of candidate snps and differences  in non-model species. this suggests the method can be applied to many domestic and wildlife species lacking sequenced genomes. further, we found that baiting a small fraction of the exome yielded thousands of candidate heterozygous snps.

RESULTS
we sequenced genomic dna from our three individuals, enriched for  <dig>  exons  by hybridization to probes on a microarray. reference exon sequences came from sampling an average of  <dig> exons from each of  <dig>  genes spread evenly across the  <dig> autosomes and the x chromosome. we also chose  <dig> candidate genes with known associations with disease susceptibility and other important traits. for all candidate genes, the entire exon sets were targeted for capture.

illumina genome analyzer sequencing of the enriched dna, followed by mapping of the  <dig> base-pair, single end sequence reads and consensus genotyping with maq software  <cit> , yielded high-confidence nucleotide base calls  comprising 77% of our targeted exonic positions in the taurine, 80% in the zebu and 82% in the bison . the called single-nucleotide genotypes differed from the reference across the genome at positions totalling  <dig>  in the bison,  <dig>  in the zebu, and  <dig>  in the taurine .

as a percentage of total targeted nucleotides with high confidence base calls,  <dig> % of the bison calls differed from the reference taurine, compared to  <dig> % for each of the two bos species. the higher percentage of differences in the bison is expected in light of its one to two million years of genetic separation from the taurine cattle   <cit> . the divergence between the two species in the target region of the exome estimated by our results, about  <dig> differences in every thousand bases, is likely conservative, given the limitations of mapping software in accounting for real base differences versus incorrect sequencer base calls .

in our  <dig> candidate genes, we identified  <dig> putative heterozygous snps among  <dig> genes in the bison,  <dig> heterozygous snps in  <dig> genes in the zebu, and  <dig> in  <dig> genes in the taurine. it is encouraging that from only one individual zebu, for example, we find high-confidence snp calls in 60% of our  <dig> candidate genes of interest for future research. for all targeted base pairs,  <dig>  heterozygous positions were called in our taurine,  <dig>  in the zebu, and  <dig>  in the bison . concordance of some of our called single-base differences with published snps is indicated by the  <dig>  of our taurine variant calls matching in position and all but one allele among  <dig>  million ncbi dbsnp  <cit>  records positioned on the same reference genome used in our study. as expected we found lower dbsnp concordance in our non-taurus individuals; about 11% among our zebu's called differences were matched in dbsnp and 4% of our bison's snp calls had matches .

for each individual, total consensus bases different from the reference, for heterozygous snps, fixed differences, and concordance with  <dig>  million entries in ncbi's dbsnp database. total differences from the reference are also given as a percentage of total genotyped bases. dbsnp position matches are also given as a percentage of total differences. dbsnp allele mismatches give the number of alleles that differed from a dbsnp allele while matching its position; for example, in the bison, of the  <dig> positions matching snps in dbsnp,  <dig> showed alleles different than those listed at dbsnp.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate two novel strategies for exon capture:  sampling a small but genome-wide subset of the exome for discovery of thousands of putative snps, and  successful bait and capture across relatively divergent genomes. result  reduces the cost of sequencing the capture products, making genome-wide snp discovery more affordable. exon capture with a subset of exons can complement large genotyping projects  by facilitating discovery of thousands of snps based on assaying many individuals to avoid ascertainment bias in population genetic inferences  <cit> . further, it allows genotyping of both candidate genes and genome-wide loci, combining the strengths of the candidate gene and genome scan approaches commonly used to identify adaptive and economically important loci.

result  makes feasible these analyses in natural populations of divergent species with lesser-known genomes and from diverse environments worldwide, e.g. domestic and wild bovids from siberia to the tropics. the conservation of exon sequences appears sufficient for the method to enable genome-wide studies based on probing across taxa as phylogenetically divergent as american bison and taurine cattle. future research should test increased divergence between organisms referenced and baited to see how wide a taxonomic distance the method can bridge.

with success across many taxa while targeting a high value part of the exome small enough for affordable next-generation sequencing of many individuals, exon capture can be a powerful application of high-throughput genomics to the genetic analysis of populations, even in species with enormous genomes but no whole-genome reference. it has exciting potential to reveal in unprecedented detail the genetic basis of evolution, including adaptive differentiation and speciation.
