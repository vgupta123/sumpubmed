BACKGROUND
proteases catalyze the hydrolysis of proteins, which leads to the production of small peptides and amino acids  <cit> . the vast diversity in proteases, regardless of their mode of action and specificity has attracted worldwide attention for using them in biotechnological applications  <cit> . recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the use of enzymes as industrial catalysts. the global market for industrial enzymes was estimated around $ <dig>  billion in  <dig>  this market is expected to reach $ <dig>  billion by  <dig>  with the annual growth rate of 6% over the 5-year forecast period  <cit> . proteases represent one of the major groups of enzymes produced and account for 60% of the worldwide sale of the total industrial enzymes  <cit> . alkaline proteases hold a big share of the enzyme market and primarily used as detergent additives. furthermore, alkaline proteases are found to be useful in other industrial sectors, such as leather, food, feed, textile, organic synthesis, pharmaceutical, silk, and for recovery of silver from used x-ray films  <cit> . although bacterial and fungal  <cit> , proteases are used in various industrial applications, insect proteases have comparatively gained lesser attention.

microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi remain a major source to obtain industrially important protease till date. in fact, most of the alkaline proteases are especially derived and extensively studied from high yielding strains of bacillus species <cit> . however, most of the alkaline proteases from microbial species applied for industrial purpose have some limitations, which include low activity and stability towards anionic surfactant  and oxidizing agents  that are common ingredients in modern detergent formulations. and secondly production cost; around  <dig> to 40% of the production cost of industrial enzymes is accounted for the growth medium of proteases  <cit> . the industrial demand of highly active preparations of proteolytic enzymes with appropriate specificity and chemostability eventually stimulated the search of alternative protease source.

in this context, insects can act as a promising option for isolating proteases that hold industrially important characteristics. the digestive enzymes of the insects are of interest as a target for insect control and also because of their unusual ability to function in alkaline microenvironment of the gut   <cit> . these observations substantiate that insect gut proteases are finely designed to work optimally in alkaline conditions  <cit> . proteolysis is an essential part of food digestion in insects and this process is mediated by the concerted action of several digestive enzymes, which possess the important characteristics such as high temperature and alkaline ph optimum  <cit> . therefore, these characters of insect proteases are promising while using them for industrial purpose  <cit> . previously, we showed that crude gut extract of p. americana contains several trypsin and chymotrypsin-like proteases  <cit> . these enzymes were found to be highly active at alkaline ph therefore could be used as detergent additives. the proteases from p. americana and other insect species exhibit highly alkaline optimum ph ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  thus, investigating the potential of p. americana gut proteases is of great importance as an industrial point of view. we have selected p. americana midgut caecae as a source of study, since it is a factory of diverse proteases, with an objective to exploit properties of these important enzymes.

here, we report the isolation, purification and characterization of a serine alkaline protease from p. americana midgut caecae. the isolated enzyme exhibited stability towards anionic, nonionic surfactants, oxidizing agents and organic solvents. furthermore, the potential applications of the purified protease in various industries have been discussed.

discussion
proteases with strong activity and stability in highly alkaline ph range are essentially important for biotechnological applications. for example, proteases constitute one of the most important groups of enzymes, which are used as key ingredients in detergent formulation  <cit> . with the advent of new frontiers in biotechnology, the spectrum of protease application has expanded into many new fields such as clinical, pharmaceutical and analytical chemistry  <cit> . generally alkaline proteases used in industrial processes are obtained from microorganism; however, these sources have limitations while using in industries. thus, it is essential to search alternative and reliable sources of proteases with high activity and stability in various conditions. insect midgut can be an important source to obtain proteases with necessary properties. previously, we did find high protease activity in the gut of p. americana, therefore the present study is an attempt to isolate and characterize chemostable proteases from this important insect species  <cit> .

the alkaline protease from p. americana midgut caecae was purified and characterized for its biochemical properties  <cit> . earlier, lopez and terra  <cit>  purified a 29 kda digestive trypsin from p. americana and the purification of enzyme was achieved using a combination of two anionic chromatographic steps  <cit> . similar protocol was used for the purification of the trypsin from tenebrio molitor <cit> . both above-mentioned studies concluded that, although similar in many instances, p. americana and t. molitor trypsins differ mainly in their charges. surprisingly, p. americana trypsin binds with anionic resins both at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , despite its pi of  <dig> . perhaps local surface charges are strong enough to make possible the binding even when the molecule overall charge would be contrary to that. from the observed molecular weight enzyme isolated by us, seems similar to those trypsins isolated from p. americana and t. molitor. moreover, p. americana protease isolated in the present study, perhaps the known trypsin reported by lopez and terra  <cit> .

the purified protease was found to be active at alkaline ph . the enzyme also showed good stability in broad ph range i.e. from ph  <dig> to  <dig>  it has been well known that a large number of proteases present in the insect gut act in high alkaline ph range. our findings are in accordance with the properties of proteases reported from previous studies; cockroach  <cit> , spilosoma obliqua   <cit> , spodoptera litura   <cit> , heliothis zea   <cit> , galleria mellonella   <cit> helicoverpa armigera   <cit> , and tenebrio molitor   <cit> . most of the insects have midgut ph in the range of  <dig> to  <dig>  gut ph conditions are likely to have a major influence on the efficiency of nutrient extraction in insects. the high ph of many insect guts has been attributed to an adaptation of their leaf-eating ancestors for extracting hemicelluloses from plant cell walls  <cit> . furthermore, there are some correlations between the midgut enzymes and surrounding symbiotic microflora. studies from analysis of genomes have concluded that insects do not possess the entire metabolic repertoire to efficiently extract the maximum of nutrients from their food and they depend on their gut microbial community for this purpose  <cit> . gut bacteria are unique in the sense that they can thrive in the hostile environment of gut, withstanding extremes of ph and ionic composition and steep redox gradations. moreover, gut microorganisms are critical to the nutrition, physiology, detoxification and resistance mechanism  <cit> . overall, it seems that gut microorganisms have significant contribution in multiple isoforms, diversity and stability of enzymes found in insect gut.

optimum temperature for activity of alkaline protease was determined to evaluate its suitability for biotechnological applications. the purified alkaline protease exhibited a temperature optimum at 60°c and stability in the temperature range  <dig> to 70°c. previously, we reported the temperature optima for proteases in the crude caecae extract of p. americana was around  <dig> to 70°c  <cit> . the alkaline proteases from other insects also found to be thermostable and their temperature optima were between 50-60°c  <cit> . for application in detergents and tanning processes, alkaline protease with high temperature and alkaline ph optima are desirable  <cit> . thus, insect proteases can be suitable candidates for these purposes, as they exhibit required characteristics. studies on enzyme inhibitors further insights into biochemical properties of the p. americana purified protease. the purified enzyme was characterized as a serine protease because its activity was completely inhibited by a specific serine protease inhibitor pmsf. pmsf binds specifically to a serine residue in the active site of serine protease. this is a result of the hyperactivity of serine residue caused by the specific environmental conditions in the enzyme’s active site. because pmsf binds covalently to the enzyme, the complex can be viewed by x-ray crystallography; it can therefore be used as a chemical label to identify an essential active site serine in an enzyme  <cit> . the chelating agents dtnb, edta and β-mercaptoethanol had no influence on the activity of purified enzyme. the high activity of p. americana protease in presence of chelating agent is very useful for employing as detergent additive since most of the detergents contain chelating agents as major component.

the purified protease from p. americana showed considerable activity at high concentration of various metal ions. proteases having stability towards higher concentration of metal ions are usually suitable in leather processes, sewage treatment etc. in addition to the stability towards temperature, ph, and metal ions, enzyme used in detergent formulation must be active in presence of surfactants, oxidizing agents and other detergent additive  <cit> . alkaline proteases from high yielding bacterial strains have been studied extensively. however, few reports are available on the stability of the alkaline proteases towards surfactants and oxidizing agents  <cit> . most commonly used proteases such as subtilisin, esperase and savinase are stable in various detergent components but unstable in oxidizing agents  <cit> . p. americana protease exhibited excellent stability and activity against surfactants and oxidizing agents. there is great industrial demand for organic solvent stable proteases to employ in the synthesis of useful pharmaceutical products  <cit> . therefore, proteases, which are naturally stable in organic solvents, are essential for synthetic reactions and peptide synthesis and accordingly the protease from p. americana exhibited such features.

CONCLUSIONS
present study deals with the characterization and potential applications of a serine alkaline protease purified from p. americana. sds-page and native gel followed zymographic analyses revealed monomeric nature of the enzyme with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the purified protease was found active and stable in higher temperature and alkaline ph range. enzyme exhibited excellent stability and compatibility towards detergents, oxidizing and bleaching agents. obtained results point out that the essential properties of p. americana protease can be exploited in various important bioformulations and industrial applications. altogether, insects appear to be a potential source to obtain industrially important proteases. protein engineering has played a central role in improving commercially important enzymes and in finding new applications of proteins quite different from their natural function. in future, protein engineering will offer possibilities of generating proteases with entirely new functions. hence, although alkaline proteases already play an important role in several industries, their potential is much greater and their applications in future processes are likely to increase in the near future.
