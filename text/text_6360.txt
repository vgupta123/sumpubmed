BACKGROUND
hypocrea jecorina  is an abundant filamentous ascomycete. h. jecorina breaks down polysaccharides with a variety of hydrolytic enzymes that act synergistically  <cit> . due to the high secretory capacity of this fungus , h. jecorina has gained industrial importance and is employed both in the fermentative production of native extracellular enzymes and heterologous protein production. the hydrolases that are secreted by this fungus are applicable to many industries, including textiles , food and feed, , paper  and, most recently, biofuel production  <cit> .

in  <dig>  we reported the identification of the main activator of hydrolases in h. jecorina, xyr <dig>   <cit> . in addition to xyr <dig>  two transcription factors, ace <dig>  and ace <dig> , are potentially involved in the regulation of hydrolases in h. jecorina  <cit> . these two additional narrow domain transcription factors seem to directly modulate the mode of action of the general regulator xyr <dig>  <cit> . the carbon catabolite repressor cre <dig>  <cit>  has also been described as a wide domain repressor of particular hydrolase-encoding genes . some years ago it was also postulated that another putative repressor protein exists that is specific for xyn <dig>   <cit> . an in vivo genomic footprinting approach identified the agaa-box within the xyn <dig> promoter as a relevant cis-acting motif that is protected under glucose repressing conditions. until recently, however, the corresponding trans-acting factor was not known.

geyer and co-workers showed for the restriction endonuclease mboi that protein-dna complexes could be identified with metal affinity chromatography, followed by mass spectrometry  <cit> . later, affinity chromatography-selex  was reported to be suitable for isolating transcription factors and modelling protein-dna interactions  <cit> . in  <dig>  a streptavidin affinity assay was used to purify proteins of a known size that bind to the ap- <dig>  sequence  in human cancer cells; these proteins were subsequently identified by sequencing the sds-page  protein bands  <cit> .

herein, we describe the isolation and identification of a transcription factor of unknown size with the combination of streptavidin affinity chromatography, a nano-hplc -tandem ms -coupled detection system, and a genome based allocation. our method is a fast genomic-proteomic approach for the identification of new and completely unknown transcription factors starting from a protein-dna complex identified with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .

RESULTS
the agaa-motif within the xyn <dig> promoter is bound under glucose-repressing conditions
in vivo genomic footprinting data indicate that the transcriptional regulation of xyn <dig> expression involves the following cis-acting elements: a ccaat-box, two xyr1-binding motifs  known to bind xyr <dig> , and an agaa-box  <cit> . figure  <dig> summarizes the architecture of the xyn <dig> promoter. the agaa-box, as well as the ccaat-box and one xyr1-binding motif, are located on the antisense strand. the agaa tetranucleotide is fully protected under non-inducing conditions  <cit> . cell-free extract protein from h. jecorina transferred to repressing  or inducing  conditions was subjected to an emsa using radiolabeled probes. a protein-dna complex was readily observed using cell-free extract obtained under repressing conditions and a short oligonucleotide containing the agaa-box  . no protein-dna interaction was detected when cell-free extracts from inducing conditions were used , supporting the idea that this part of the promoter is involved in repression. if the agaa sequence is mutated ctcc , no dna-protein complex is formed under either repressing or inducing conditions . this result indicates that this part of the xyn <dig> promoter is essential for binding a transcription factor under repressing conditions.

the employment of the oligonucleotides used in this study is given. underlined bases represent introduced restriction enzyme sites or bases added for labelling. double underlined bases indicate introduced point mutations.

streptavidin-based isolation and identification of agaa-binding proteins
the dna-protein complex observed in the emsa includes a putative repressor of xyn <dig> transcription . to isolate this complex, the same batch of cell-free extracts from h. jecorina transferred to glucose was subjected to affinity chromatography. a schematic of the procedure is shown in figure  <dig>  biotinylated versions of the same oligonucleotides used for the emsa  were incubated on ice with streptavidin beads . under the emsa reaction conditions, this mixture was incubated with the cell-free extract, which should include xpp <dig> . after magnetic separation, the whole eluate was subjected to nano-hplc separation. the eluted peptides were monitored on the hplc at a wavelength of  <dig> nm and directly applied to the mass spectrometer.

the tandem mass spectra were analyzed in silico as described above.  <dig> eluted proteins  were identified and analyzed further with fgenesh v <dig> and genewise  <dig>  three proteins with dna-binding domains were identified and represent potential transcription factors . these proteins ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ) were investigated in more detail and are hereafter referred to as "2488prp" , "3151prp", and "7236prp". the mass spectra for these three selected candidate genes are available online at: http://cores.imba.oeaw.ac.at/index.php?id= <dig> 

to verify that the genes encoding 2488prp, 3151prp, and 7236prp correspond to transcripts in h. jecorina, we performed rt-pcr using cdnas obtained under inducing and non-inducing conditions. using the primers listed in table  <dig>  we could clearly detect transcripts for the genes 2488prp, 3151prp, and 7236prp .

cloning, expression, and binding of putative agaa-binding transcription factors of h. jecorina
since transcripts for all three genes encoding the putative regulatory proteins were detected, the respective dna-binding domains  were cloned and expressed as gst-fusion proteins using the pgex-4t- <dig> vector and e. coli bl21-gold. production of the recombinant proteins was verified by sds-page . all clones, two for the expression of the 3151prp dbd, three for the expression of the 7236prp dbd, and two for the expression of the 2488prp dbd, produced proteins of expected sizes . two clones expressing gst alone were applied as controls and also produced bands of the correct size .

the thrombin-cleaved dbd constructs were analyzed with an emsa using an oligonucleotide covering the whole xyn <dig> promoter  or an oligonucleotide bearing the agaa-box mutated to ctcc . fam-labelled probes seem to demand longer probes: a fam-labelled  pxyn2a only gave a weak shift . no shift was observed with the gst control or the 3151prp dbd . the 7236prp dbd yielded two protein-dna complexes, but these are rather non-specific, as they also formed with the mutated probe . in contrast, the 2488prp dbd produced one slow-migrating shift that was not observed with the mutated probe , indicating the formation of an agaa-box specific dna-protein complex. this candidate was analyzed in more detail.

the binding of 2488prp to the xyn <dig> promoter of h. jecorina
because 2488prp dbd produced an agaa-box specific shift in the emsa , the corresponding gene was subjected to in vitro translation. the accumulation of product from the in vitro translation was confirmed with sds-page of the fluorotectâ„¢green-labelled proteins . a negative control reaction containing no dna template produced no specific protein, but a positive control reaction containing a plasmid that codes for luciferase gave a protein band of the correct size  . using the plasmid pmpf <dig> as template in an in vitro translation experiment was also found to yield a protein band of the expected size  . background bands of  <dig> kd  and  <dig> -  <dig> kd  are associated with the in vitro translation procedure . we then performed an emsa using the in vitro translated, unlabelled 2488prp and the labelled oligonucleotides . no dna-protein complex formed with the mutated probe  , but one specific shift was observed with the probe lacking mutations  . this shifted band migrated more slowly than the positive control shifted band using in vitro translated xyr <dig> . xyr <dig>  a general hydrolase activating transcription factor in h. jecorina  <cit> , was recently reported to bind the xyn <dig> promoter  <cit> , acting as a cis-acting element near the agaa-box, which is also present on the applied oligonucleotide. the two shifts with the fastest mobility in the reactions containing oligonucleotide lpxyn <dig> and in vitro translated 2488prp or xyr <dig>  are background. these shifts also appear if the in vitro translation mixture is given no dna-template or the luciferase protein . therefore, we conclude that 2488prp binds the agaa-box of the xyn <dig> promoter in vitro.

characterisation of 2488prp
the putative 2488prp gene encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig> kd. sequence alignments indicate that the entire 2488prp protein has significant sequence similarity to hypothetical proteins in nectria haematococca , gibberella zeae , neurospora crassa , podospora anserina  chaetomium globosum , magnaporthe grisea . the most similarity was found in the c-terminal part of the protein , which includes a helix-loop-helix domain  with an overall length of  <dig> amino acids . a detailed domain analysis according to  <cit>  revealed a basic dna binding region  n-terminal to two alpha-helices separated by a loop region . the basic n-terminal region is thought to mediate high-affinity dna-binding  <cit> , whereas the helix-loop-helix region functions as a dimerization interface  <cit> . a glutamic acid at position  <dig> strongly indicates that 2488prp belongs to the group of e-box binding hlh proteins . the classical e-box is a hexameric palindrome. interestingly, the agaa-box overlaps with a hexameric palindrome . only the antisense part of this potential e-box has been reported to be protected according to in vivo footprinting experiments  <cit> . the sense strand cannot be analyzed because the sequence extension in the linker-mediated pcr is fully determined at the tata-box .

transcription of 2488prp during cultivation in different carbon sources
in h. jecorina, the expression of the hydrolytic enzyme-encoding genes, such as xyn <dig>  xyn <dig>  bxl <dig>  cbh <dig> , cbh <dig> , egl <dig> , or bgl <dig> , is regulated by the general activator xyr <dig>  regardless of the carbon source or inducing substance  <cit> . nevertheless, different expression/induction patterns for these genes have been observed  <cit> . we examined, whether the transcription of this putative regulatory protein depends on the presence of certain induction signals or various carbon sources.

after pre-cultivation, the mycelium of h. jecorina was transferred to medium lacking a carbon source  or to media containing 1%  glucose, glycerol , d-xylose or xylan or  <dig>  mm sophorose or xylobiose . cultures were incubated for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours. after rna-extraction followed by cdna synthesis, the transcript levels were analyzed via real-time pcr.

we observed that the abundance of the 2488prp transcript increases in the presence of carbon sources that repress hydrolase expression, such as glucose or glycerol, relative to de-repressing conditions . similar observations were made when comparing inducing conditions, such as growth on d-xylose or xylan or in media containing xylobiose or sophorose, with transcript forming in media containing glucose . in all cases, it was clear that the transcription of the putative repressor 2488prp gene was downregulated. these data strongly indicate that 2488prp transcription is upregulated under repressive conditions and that this protein functions as a repressor of hydrolase transcription.

discussion
in the last few decades, several techniques have been developed to identify new dna regulatory elements. both in vitro methods, such as emsa with cell-free or nuclear extracts , and in vivo approaches, such as the in vivo genomic footprinting assay  and promoter deletion analyses, have enabled the identification of numerous cis-acting elements.

the isolation and identification of the corresponding trans-acting factors is still challenging, however. until recently, affinity chromatography based methods for the isolation of transcription regulators demanded large amounts of samples  and/or laborious pre-purifications steps ). furthermore, additional purification steps, such as one- or two-d gel electrophoreses, were necessary to obtain at least semi-purified protein, which could thereafter be subjected to nanospray ms/ms fragmentation sequencing  <cit> . although such methods led to the identification of transcription factors, they are labour-intensive and not suitable for high-throughput analyses.

recently, the yeast one hybrid  system was established, offering an in vivo method of screening respective transcription factors in a living cell  <cit> . this method depends on the completeness of the cdna library, however. thus, cdnas of rare mrnas, such as those of transcription factors and narrow domain regulators, are often missed. furthermore, if the dna binding depends on posttranslational modifications or the presence of additional interacting factors, it is even more likely that relevant interactions can be missed. the y <dig> h system is also laborious and time-consuming  and therefore only partially useful for high-throughput screening approaches. in addition, y <dig> h and y <dig> h approaches are known to be prone to false positives .

the method described in this study requires only small amounts of protein extract and the preceding extraction procedure is easy and fast. it combines a single-step micro affinity chromatography purification based on prior in vivo and/or in vitro protein-dna-interaction data and high-resolution analyses. the nano-hplc/tandem ms-coupled detection allows the separation and identification of up to  <dig> proteins in one sample. such a large number of identified candidate proteins enable the allocation of protein complexes interacting with the respective dna target. we required that the putative transcription factor contain a predictable dna binding domain to be considered for further analyses. comparing protein extracts derived from different growth or environmental conditions and/or from a time-course experiment could provide information on the dynamics of protein networks interacting with the dna. finally, such a technique will permit mutational analysis of cis-acting dna elements.

in this study, the most promising protein that was identified  is an e-box binding hlh protein. the classical e-box is a hexameric palindrome. interestingly, the agaa-box overlaps with a hexameric palindrome . until this work, only the antisense part of this potential e-box was reported to be protected in footprinting experiments in vivo  <cit> , because the sense strand cannot be analyzed due to sequence extension in the linker-mediated pcr is fully determined at the tata-box .

CONCLUSIONS
the method developed here should be applicable to other high-throughput experiments, given available genome sequence databases. it permits the assignment of a promoter-binding protein  to its previously identified cis-acting element  under various conditions  for the expression of a certain gene of interest . the described genomic-proteomic approach facilitates the fast one-step isolation and identification of an unknown promoter-binding protein. in addition, this method assists in assigning the promoter-binding protein to a certain gene regulatory function.
