BACKGROUND
faf <dig>  is a p <dig> cofactor from the ubx-domain family. humans express  <dig> ubx-domain proteins, most of which interact with the p <dig> atpase via their c-terminal ubx-domain  <cit> . exceptionally, ubxd <dig> does not interact with the p <dig> n-terminus via its ubx domain, but uses its pub domain to bind the c-terminus of p <dig>  <cit> . five of these cofactors, including faf <dig>  have been termed uba-ubx proteins due to the presence of a ubiquitin-associated  domain at their n-terminus, which mediates interaction with ubiquitinated proteins. the general function of uba-ubx proteins is that of ubiquitin-binding adaptors for the p <dig> atpase  <cit> . furthermore, three uba-ubx proteins – ubxd <dig> , ubxd <dig>  and faf <dig> – all have a central uas domain, which was recently shown to interact with long-chain unsaturated fatty acids thereby mediating uba-ubx protein oligomerization  <cit> . however, the various uba-ubx proteins are not functionally redundant, due, at least in part, to the presence of specific domains that are found in a single uba-ubx protein. for example, the uim domain, which is only present in ubxd <dig>  allows this protein to interact specifically with the nedd <dig> modification on cullins  <cit> . owing to their atpase activity, p <dig> complexes function as ‘segregases’, which can dissociate their targets from protein partners  <cit>  or even retrotranslocate proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum  back into the cytosol to allow for their ubiquitination and degradation  <cit> . this latter function is fundamental for p97’s role in er-associated degradation , a quality control pathway that ensures degradation of er proteins that are misfolded or misassembled  <cit> .

vesicle-associated proteins  are highly conserved across eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals  <cit> . humans express two vap proteins, vapa and vapb, whose primary sequence is 63% identical. both are membrane-anchored at the er and golgi via c-terminal transmembrane domains  <cit>  and can exist as homo- or heterodimers  <cit> . oligomerization is largely mediated by a cytoplasmic coiled-coil region, with some contribution from the transmembrane domain  <cit> . vap proteins contain an msp domain in their n-terminal half, which has been shown to interact with proteins containing a ffat motif , such as members of the oxysterol-binding protein  family or the phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins from the pitpnm family  <cit> . the consensus sequence for the ffat motif is effdaxe, with an acidic tract immediately upstream of it  <cit> . the crystal structure of the msp domain bound to a ffat peptide suggests that a vap dimer may bind two ffat motifs, with the ffats engaging each other and both msp domains of the dimer  <cit> .

a phe <dig> to ser mutation in the msp domain of vapb causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  type  <dig> in humans, transmitted in an autosomally dominant manner  <cit> . subsequently, another vapb mutation in the same region  was identified in a british als patient  <cit> . als is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which affects upper and lower motor neurons and is lethal within 5 years of clinical onset  <cit> . interestingly, in some cases mutations in p <dig> can also cause als  <cit> .

our mass spectrometry analysis of flag-faf <dig> immunoprecipitates led to the identification of vapa and vapb as potential interaction partners for faf <dig>  given the implication of both vapb and p <dig> in als, we decided to follow up on this interaction, aiming to understand whether faf <dig> might link vapb and p <dig> in a common functional pathway. we show that vapb interaction with faf <dig> is not mediated by ubiquitin-modification of vapb, but it is due to the presence of a ffat-like motif in faf <dig>  further work identified a very similar ffat-like motif in asna <dig>  which we demonstrate is another novel binding partner for vapb. although vapb itself is not a ubiquitinated target for faf1/p <dig>  we found that vapb does interact with ubiquitinated proteins in a faf1-dependent manner and, subsequently, identified rpn <dig> as a common ubiquitinated target for vapb and faf <dig> 

RESULTS
faf <dig> interacts with vapa and vapb
both vapa and vapb were identified by mass spectrometry in flag-faf <dig> immunoprecipitates from human u2os cells . we first sought to confirm these interactions by western blotting. indeed, vapa and vapb were detected in flag-faf <dig> immunoprecipitates from u2os cells, using specific antibodies . conversely, both faf <dig> and p <dig> were present in flag-vapa and flag-vapb immunoprecipitates from u2os cells . next, we showed that flag-vapb interaction with p <dig> is drastically reduced in cells treated with faf <dig> sirna . in contrast, treatment with p <dig> sirna had little, if any, effect on faf <dig> binding to flag-vapb . we therefore conclude that p <dig> binding to vapb is mediated by faf <dig> to verify that faf <dig> and vapb also interact at endogenous levels, we raised rabbit antibodies to vapb and performed an immunoprecipitation from mouse brain extracts. as shown in figure 1d, endogenous vapb interacts with faf <dig> and p <dig> in the brain. reciprocally, endogenous faf <dig> co-immunoprecipitated vapb from u2os cells . furthermore, we showed using immunofluorescence microscopy that both vapb and flag-faf <dig> exhibit a punctate cytoplasmic staining and they are co-localized, most notably in the peri-nuclear region in a pattern typical for er proteins .

vapb is not targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation
because faf <dig> is a ubiquitin-binding adaptor for the p <dig> atpase  <cit> , we initially assumed that vapb might be targeted for proteasomal degradation and interact with faf <dig> in its ubiquitinated form. however, we found that proteasome inhibition with mg <dig> for  <dig> or 6 hr had no effect on vapb levels , nor could we detect ubiquitinated forms of vapb even after a long exposure of flag-vapb immunoprecipitates . moreover, vapb interaction with flag-faf <dig> was not affected by mg <dig> treatment although we could detect an increased binding of ubiquitinated proteins to faf <dig> . these data suggested that vapb is not targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. hence, vapb interaction with faf <dig> and p <dig> appears to serve a function other than facilitating vapb degradation.

faf <dig> interaction with vapb is mediated by a ffat-like sequence in faf <dig> and the msp domain of vapb
to better understand the interaction of vapb with faf <dig>  we tried to map the interaction domains in both proteins. our task was very simple as far as vapb is concerned. the n-terminal half of vapb comprises an msp domain, followed by a coiled-coil region and the transmembrane region at the extreme c-terminus. upon over-expression in human cells, we found that the msp domain alone was as competent in interacting with faf <dig> and p <dig> as full-length vapb . in contrast, the c-terminal region of vapb did not interact with faf1/p <dig> at all.mapping the interaction region in faf <dig> turned out to be more challenging. the domain architecture of faf <dig> comprises a uba domain at the n-terminus, which mediates the interaction with ubiquitin, followed by two ubiquitin-like  domains, a uas domain and the ubx domain at the c-terminus, which mediates interaction with p <dig> . we expressed in human cells n-terminally flag-tagged truncated versions of faf <dig> lacking the uba domain, the two ubls, or the uas and also faf <dig> carrying a point mutation in the ubx domain . as expected, uba deletion abolished ubiquitin binding and the p620g mutation abolished p <dig> binding. however, to our surprise, all these faf <dig> variants had wild-type ability to interact with vapb .

because the msp domain of vapb is known to interact with various proteins carrying a ffat motif  <cit> , we searched the faf <dig> sequence for the presence of such a motif. there was no typical ffat motif in faf <dig>  yet in the region between the two ubls and the uas domain, we identified a short sequence that highly resembled ffat motifs, the main difference being that in faf <dig> the second phenylalanine residue is replaced by an additional acidic residue . we therefore tested whether deletion of the ffat-like region in faf <dig> has any effect on vapb binding. indeed, the removal of only nine amino acids from residue  <dig> to  <dig> resulted in a complete loss of vapb binding, while p <dig> and ubiquitinated protein binding remained unaffected . to exclude the possibility that this short truncation might affect faf <dig> folding, we went on to create a triple mutant  and three individual point mutants in that region – d295a, f296a and e297a. both the triple mutant and the f296a mutation abolished vapb binding, while the other two point mutants retained the wild-type ability to interact with vapb . we therefore conclude that faf <dig> interacts with vapb via a highly conserved ffat-like motif , with the single phenylalanine residue present in this region being particularly important for the interaction.

vapb directly interacts with faf <dig> in vitro and the interaction is not affected by the mutation causing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
next, we checked whether recombinant vapb and faf <dig> could interact when mixed together in vitro. we expressed in bacteria full-length flag-tagged faf <dig> and a truncated version of vapb lacking the c-terminal transmembrane region. using anti-flag beads, we were able to isolate both flag-faf <dig> and vapb , suggesting that vapb interacts directly with faf <dig> and does not require additional cofactors.

the p56s mutation in vapb that was identified in als patients causes the protein to aggregate and to become insoluble when expressed in mammalian cells in culture  <cit> . due to the difficulty of extracting vapb p56s from human cells, it was not possible for us to study how this mutation might affect faf <dig> binding in human cells. however, we found that both wild-type and vapb p56s can be readily expressed in bacteria. recombinant vapb p56s retained the wild-type ability to interact with flag-faf <dig> in vitro . in contrast, a vapb double mutant known to be defective in ffat binding, k87d m89d  <cit> , could not be co-immunoprecipitated with faf <dig> under the same conditions. these results indicate that the p56s mutation as such does not perturb vapb interaction with faf <dig> 

vapb interaction with faf <dig> and p <dig> is stimulated upon proteasome inhibition
as indicated above, vapb did not appear to be targeted for proteasomal degradation. however, upon flag-vapb immunoprecipitation from human cells expressing vapb from a tetracycline-inducible promoter, we found that vapb interacted with ubiquitinated proteins and the interaction was stimulated upon proteasome inhibition with mg <dig> . interestingly, proteasome inhibition also stimulated vapb interaction with faf <dig> and p <dig> . similar results were obtained when we immunoprecipitated endogenous vapb using specific antibodies . these data suggested that although vapb is not a proteasome target itself, it can interact with proteins that are ubiquitinated and destined for proteasome-mediated degradation.because ubiquitin and faf <dig> binding to vapb appeared to correlate, and because faf <dig> is a ubiquitin-binding protein, we next tested whether faf <dig> was required for vapb interaction with ubiquitinated proteins. we found that the binding of ubiquitinated proteins was strongly reduced in flag-vapb immunoprecipitates from cells treated with four independent sirna oligos for faf <dig> compared to cells treated with no sirna or luciferase sirna . similarly, the binding of ubiquitinated proteins to endogenous vapb was reduced upon faf <dig> depletion . these data suggest that faf <dig> might facilitate, at least in part, the binding of ubiquitinated proteins to vapb. furthermore, the vapb double mutant k87d m89d  as well as the truncated form of vapb lacking the msp domain  are not only defective in ffat and faf <dig> binding, but also in ubiquitin binding . these vapb variants seem to preferentially bind proteins carrying shorter ubiquitin chains than wild-type vapb, raising the interesting possibility that faf <dig> might, in fact, be required to protect the ubiquitin chains from deubiquitinating enzymes or from premature degradation. for comparison, we include a long exposure of a flag western blot to demonstrate that the different pattern observed in the ubiquitin blot is not due to differences in the migration of flag-vapb itself. the prominent band that can be detected half way between  <dig> and 75 kda upon long exposure of anti-flag blots, we presume to represent vapb dimers that resist sds denaturation.

mass spectrometry analysis of vapb immunoprecipitates reveals vapb interaction with the trc subunits
in an attempt to identify the ubiquitinated proteins that interact with vapb, we used the stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture  technique of mass spectrometry on endogenous vapb immunoprecipitates to search for proteins that accumulate after  <dig> and 6 hr of proteasome inhibition with mg <dig>  as expected, several osbps and other ffat proteins were identified in vapb immunoprecipitates, but their light/heavy silac ratios were often close to  <dig> and did not follow a pattern consistent with accumulation in the mg <dig> treated samples, i.e. ratios higher than  <dig> when the light samples were treated with mg <dig> and ratios lower than  <dig> when the heavy samples were treated with mg <dig> . hence, their binding to vapb appeared to be unaffected by proteasome inhibition. in general, we noticed that proteasome inhibition caused only a mild accumulation of some vapb-interacting partners, with ratios mostly below twofold. among these, our attention was drawn to the four subunits of the trc – asna <dig>  bag <dig>  ubl4a and get <dig> – that were all present in vapb immunoprecipitates and followed a similar trend of slightly accumulating upon proteasome inhibition . our interest was further strengthened by the observation that all four trc subunits were also identified by mass spectrometry in flag-faf <dig> immunoprecipitates . one subunit in particular, asna <dig> , appeared to be more abundant in flag-faf <dig> immunoprecipitates from cells treated with mg <dig>  hence, we went on to evaluate asna <dig> as a potential ubiquitinated target that vapb and faf <dig> might have in common.

a
aflag-faf <dig> was immunoprecipitated from u2os cells treated with mg <dig>  for  <dig>   <dig> or 6 hr as indicated. the share of spectrum ids is indicated as a measure of protein abundance in the immunoprecipitates.

asna <dig> is a novel ffat-like binding partner of vapb
to begin with, we confirmed by western blotting that asna <dig> is present in flag-vapb  and endogenous vapb immunoprecipitates from human cells . consistent with the silac mass spectrometry results, we observed a very mild increase in asna <dig> binding to endogenous vapb upon mg <dig> treatment . no such change could be observed in flag-vapb immunoprecipitates . moreover, asna <dig> levels did not change upon proteasome inhibition . taken together, these data suggested that asna <dig> may not be itself a proteasome target. however, because asna <dig> interaction with vapb was fairly robust, we proceeded to search for a potential ffat motif in any of the trc subunits that could mediate a direct interaction with vapb. this led to the identification of a ffat-like sequence close to the n-terminus of asna <dig> that was very similar to the one we uncovered in faf <dig> . as seen before for faf <dig>  this region of asna <dig> is well conserved across species . indeed, mutating the phenylalanine residue  in this putative ffat motif abolished flag-asna <dig> interaction with vapb . reciprocally, the vapb double mutant  that is defective in ffat binding was unable to interact with asna <dig> . like faf <dig>  asna <dig> interacts efficiently with the msp domain, but not with the c-terminal region of vapb . we conclude that asna <dig> interacts with the msp domain of vapb via a ffat-like motif similar to faf <dig>  as seen before for faf <dig>  flag-asna <dig> co-localization with endogenous vapb is most prominent in the peri-nuclear region .

because the trc complex has been implicated in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of mislocalized er membrane proteins  <cit> , we also checked if asna <dig> might contribute to the binding of ubiquitinated proteins to vapb. as shown in figure 4f, asna <dig> depletion by sirna leads to a reduction in flag-vapb interaction with ubiquitinated proteins. we conclude that part of the ubiquitinated targets that interact with vapb could be trc quality control targets that are recruited via asna <dig> 

faf <dig> interaction with asna <dig> depends on the uba domain
next we wanted to verify whether asna <dig> also interacts with faf <dig> as suggested by the mass spectrometry analysis . unlike asna <dig> interaction with vapb, its interaction with flag-faf <dig> was weak and hard to detect in the absence of proteasome inhibition . upon proteasome inhibition, asna <dig> interaction with flag-faf <dig> became readily detectable  and it required the uba domain of faf <dig> . conversely, flag-asna <dig> interaction with endogenous faf <dig> was only detectable upon proteasome inhibition, which also caused a considerable increase in the binding of ubiquitinated proteins to asna <dig> . interestingly, asna <dig> interaction with faf <dig> did not depend on the asna <dig> ffat-motif , but was drastically reduced by a gly <dig> point mutation in asna <dig> to either ala or arg   <cit> . we found that these two mutants are completely defective in interacting with the bag <dig> subunit of the trc complex and exhibit reduced binding to ubiquitinated proteins . taken together, these findings indicate a correlation between the binding of ubiquitinated proteins to asna <dig> and a detectable interaction with faf <dig>  they suggest that faf <dig> binding to asna <dig> is likely indirect and mediated by the ubiquitinated proteins that associate with asna <dig> 

rpn <dig> is a common ubiquitinated target for vapb and faf1
because our silac mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous vapb immunoprecipitates did not reveal any protein that would significantly accumulate upon proteasome inhibition, we reasoned that the ubiquitinated targets of vapb might be present at very low levels in the immunoprecipitates and escape our analysis. to overcome this limitation, we decided to enrich the ubiquitinated peptides prior to mass spectrometry analysis using a two-step immunoprecipitation protocol. a mixture of light-labeled flag-vapb and heavy-labeled flag-faf <dig> immunoprecipitates was trypsin-digested and the peptides carrying a di-glycine signature were isolated using antibodies specific to lysine-ϵ-glygly  <cit> . di-glycine peptides mark the site of ubiquitination in the protein of origin. they have low abundance relative to peptides that do not carry a glygly extension and they are also harder to detect by mass spectrometry. di-glycine peptide enrichment using specific antibodies greatly enhances their identification by mass spectrometry and unequivocally demonstrates which proteins identified in our immunoprecipitates were modified with ubiquitin. to specifically identify ubiquitinated targets common for vapb and faf <dig>  the list of ubiquitinated proteins obtained from the mass spectrometry analysis of di-glycine peptides was cross-referenced with proteins we previously identified by mass spectrometry in both flag-vapb and flag-faf <dig> immunoprecipitates . this revealed two potentially interesting targets, the rpn <dig> and ddost subunits of the n-oligosaccharyl-transferase , which, like vapb, are localized at the er. both proteins appeared to accumulate slightly in endogenous vapb immunoprecipitates upon proteasome inhibition, as determined by silac mass spectrometry  and were identified at low levels in flag-faf <dig> immunoprecipitates . we confirmed rpn <dig> interaction with flag-vapb and flag-faf <dig> by western blotting and found the interaction with vapb to be more robust . there was no detectable change in rpn <dig> levels upon proteasome inhibition , nor could we detect ubiquitinated forms of rpn <dig> in extracts or immunoprecipitates . this suggests that only a minor fraction of rpn <dig> is subject to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. however, we could detect a modest increase in rpn <dig> binding to endogenous vapb , consistent with the mass spectrometry results . this supports the notion that vapb interacts with a fraction of rpn <dig> that is destined for proteasome-mediated degradation. if rpn <dig> were a target for the erad quality control pathway, we reasoned that artificially inducing er stress with tunicamycin might stimulate rpn <dig> degradation and its association with vapb and faf <dig>  we found that tunicamycin treatment had no significant effect on rpn <dig> levels or its interaction with endogenous vapb . furthermore, tunicamycin did not stimulate vapb interaction with faf <dig> and there was no added effect of tunicamycin when used in combination with mg <dig>  in contrast, another glycosylated protein, cd <dig>  shifted from the glycosylated form to a faster migrating, non-glycosylated form, indicating that the tunicamycin treatment was effective at least to some extent . we are not certain whether our er-stress conditions are not optimal to affect rpn <dig> or rpn <dig> ubiquitin-dependent degradation is part of its regulation and not a quality control process.

vapa and vapb interact with proposed ffat proteins, rab3gap <dig> and wdr44
our mass spectrometry analysis of flag-vapa, flag-vapb and endogenous vapb immunoprecipitates also revealed three binding partners for vapa and vapb that appeared to be very abundant, especially in flag immunoprecipitates. these were rab3gap <dig>  rab3gap <dig> and wdr <dig> . rab3gap <dig> and  <dig> form a gtpase activating complex for rab <dig> proteins  <cit> , which are expressed specifically in the brain and regulate neurotransmitter release  <cit> . first, we set out to confirm these interactions by western blotting. indeed, flag-vapb expressed in hela cells co-immunoprecipitated rab3gap <dig> and  <dig>  as well as wdr <dig> . furthermore, endogenous vapb from mouse brain co-immunoprecipitated rab3gap <dig>  as well as wdr <dig> and asna <dig> , suggesting that these interactions could be relevant for vapb function in the brain. the seemingly strong interaction these proteins exhibited with vapa and vapb prompted us to have a closer look at their primary sequence to check if they might harbor a ffat motif. there was no such motif in rab3gap <dig>  but rab3gap <dig> did contain a short sequence that partly resembled a ffat motif . mutating both phenylalanine residues to alanine fully prevented flag-rab3gap <dig> interaction with vapb and had no effect on its interaction with rab3gap <dig> . we conclude that, although non-canonical, the short motif present in rab3gap <dig> is a bona fide ffat motif in that it mediates the interaction with vapa/b. wdr <dig>  on the other hand, contained a putative ffat motif that closely resembled those found in osbps  and was located close to the n-terminus of the protein. a truncated version of wdr <dig> lacking the first  <dig> amino acids was unable to interact with vapb , confirming that this was the region that mediated vapb binding. furthermore, we showed that the vapb double mutant defective in ffat binding  was not only defective in faf <dig> binding, but was also unable to interact with rab3gap <dig> or wdr <dig> . hence, we conclude that faf <dig>  rab3gap <dig> and wdr <dig>  all interact in a similar manner with the msp domain of vapa and vapb.

our analysis of vapb immunoprecipitates from mouse brain also revealed vapb interaction with syntaxin 1a and b  . these proteins harbor a sequence that resembles a ffat motif , but mutating the two phenylalanine residues in either stx1a or stx1b to alanine had no effect on their interaction with vapb . hence, these are not functional ffat motifs and are not responsible for syntaxin 1a/b interaction with vapb.

discussion
faf <dig> is a ffat-like binding partner for vapb
humans express five ubiquitin-binding ubx proteins, including faf <dig> and ubxd <dig>  previous work showed that ubxd <dig> is unique among p <dig> cofactors due to the presence of an uim motif that allows it to interact directly with neddylated cullins  <cit> . here we show that faf <dig> contains an atypical ffat motif that allows it to associate with the membrane-anchored proteins vapa and vapb. although distinct from the consensus proposed for ffat motifs  <cit>  due to the absence of a second aromatic residue, the ffat motif of faf <dig> is still able to mediate the interaction with the msp domain of vapb.

the uim motif of ubxd <dig> and the ffat motif of faf <dig> represent features unique to each of these ubx proteins and mediate their interaction with specific targets, neddylated cullins and vapa/b respectively. the identification of these short protein-interaction motifs supports the notion that the general function of uba-ubx proteins as ubiquitin-binding adaptors for p <dig> is complemented with specific functions mediated by singular motifs.

identification of novel binding partners of vapb carrying ffat-like sequences
the identification of a degenerated, yet functional ffat motif in faf <dig>  indicated that other proteins carrying ffat-like motifs could represent bona fide interaction partners for vapb. on one hand, non-canonical ffat motifs may be present in known vapb-binding partners and on the other hand, searching for ffat motifs that only partially match the consensus sequence could lead to the identification of novel vapb-binding partners.

we took the first approach and validated the ffat-like motifs in asna <dig>  rab3gap <dig> and wdr <dig>  proteins that we identified in vapb immunoprecipitates by mass spectrometry. mikitova and levine took the latter approach and computationally identified multiple high-confidence ffat-like proteins, based on the degree of variation that is tolerated by ffat motifs in a yeast reporter assay  <cit> . rab3gap <dig> scored high as a potential binding partner for vapb in this study, but the more divergent ffat-like motifs in faf <dig> and asna <dig> were not recognized.

ffat-like motifs of wdr <dig> and rab3gap <dig> have been picked out by prior computational searches  <cit>  and we confirm that they are functional and truly mediate vapb binding. our experiments with syntaxin 1a and b, whose ffat-like sequences are not required for the interaction with vapb, further highlight the importance of experimentally testing putative ffat motifs.

vapb interacts with ubiquitinated proteins
several observations led us to believe that vapb itself is not a proteasome substrate:  vapb does not accumulate upon proteasome inhibition with mg <dig> ;  anti-flag western blots of flag-vapb immunoprecipitates did not reveal any slower migrating, ubiquitinated forms of vapb, even after proteasome inhibition ;  vapb interaction with faf <dig> is not mediated by the ubiquitin-binding uba domain of faf <dig> , and  no ubiquitinated peptide was identified for vapb in our mass spectrometry analysis of di-glycine peptides from flag-vapb/flag-faf <dig> immunoprecipitates.

kanekura et al. previously observed ubiquitinated species in over-expressed vapb immunoprecipitates and assumed them to be ubiquitinated vapb  <cit> . instead, we present evidence for vapb interaction with ubiquitinated proteins:  vapb interacts with ubiquitinated proteins as shown by the anti-ubiquitin western blotting of flag-vapb and endogenous vapb immunoprecipitates;  vapb interacts directly with a ubiquitin-binding protein, faf <dig>  and  vapb interaction with ubiquitin is reduced when faf <dig> is depleted by treatment with sirna .one possibility is that the direct binding of faf <dig> to vapb mediates vapb interaction with ubiquitinated species that are recognized by the uba domain of faf <dig>  alternatively, the proteins that are modified with ubiquitin interact directly with vapb and faf <dig>  which is required to protect the ubiquitin chains from deubiquitinating enzymes or from degradation via alternative ubiquitin receptors. this latter possibility is strongly supported by the observation that vapb variants that cannot bind ffat proteins interact with ubiquitinated species carrying shorter ubiquitin chains than observed for wild-type vapb . furthermore, rpn <dig>  a novel ubiquitinated target we identified for vapb and faf <dig>  interacts more robustly with vapb than with faf <dig> , suggesting that the interaction is unlikely to be mediated by faf <dig> 

ffat-like proteins add to the complexity of vapb function
most, if not all, canonical ffat proteins identified to date are involved in lipid metabolism. they include lipid-binding proteins such as the osbps and lipid-transport proteins such as the pitpnms and the ceramide transfer protein   <cit> . here we show that proteins with slightly divergent ffat motifs can also interact with the msp domain of vapb. these novel interaction partners add further layers of complexity to the vapb function by implicating vapb in p97-regulated processes via faf <dig>  in trc complex function via asna <dig> and in rab <dig> regulation via rab3gaps.the related ffat motifs present in faf <dig> and asna <dig> link vapb to atpase complexes, such as p <dig> and the trc . the identification of rpn <dig> and ddost as common ubiquitinated targets for vapb and faf <dig> suggests that vapb might recruit faf1/p <dig> to ubiquitinated targets located at the er membrane . both rpn <dig> and ddost are mostly lumenal and anchored in the er membrane via c-terminal transmembrane regions. interestingly, all the ubiquitination sites we identified in rpn <dig> and ddost are located in the lumenal region of the proteins, highlighting the importance of the interaction with the p <dig> machinery for retrotranslocation from the er into the cytosol, where they would become accessible to ubiquitin ligases and the proteasome.

asna <dig>  on the other hand, mediates vapb interaction with trc, which is required for membrane insertion of some tail-anchored proteins  <cit>  and also for the elimination of mislocalized membrane proteins  <cit> . interestingly, although vapb is a tail-anchored protein, it does not interact with the trc via its c-terminal transmembrane region. we show that asna <dig> interacts only with the msp domain of vapb and not with the c-terminal region, which includes the transmembrane domain . caml and wrb were identified to be the receptors that recruit the trc to the er membrane for insertion of tail-anchored proteins  <cit> . we show that asna <dig> transiently interacts with ubiquitinated proteins that are targeted for proteasomal degradation and appear to recruit faf <dig> . furthermore, a fraction of the ubiquitinated proteins that interact with vapb are recruited via asna <dig> . it is possible that vapb may represent an alternative receptor for trcs whose ubiquitinated targets require p97/faf <dig> for degradation .

CONCLUSIONS
starting from the observation that the p <dig> cofactor faf <dig> interacts with the er membrane proteins vapa and vapb, we identified an atypical ffat sequence in faf <dig> that allows its direct interaction with the msp domain of vapa/b. a similar ffat-like sequence was subsequently recognized in the asna <dig> subunit of the trc, further expanding the repertoire of proteins that interact with vapb in this manner. the identification of two subunits of an er-resident glycosyltransferase – rpn <dig> and ddost – as common ubiquitinated targets for vapb and faf <dig>  suggests that vapb might recruit p97/faf <dig> to facilitate degradation of a subset of targets located at the er.

thus, vapb dimers emerge as a platform for docking various ffat and ffat-like proteins at the er membrane. these include proteins involved in lipid metabolism as previously noted, but also, as shown in this study, the ubiquitin receptor faf <dig>  the asna <dig> component of the trc that mediates/monitors protein insertion in the er membrane and regulatory enzymes such as rab3gap1/ <dig>  perturbations in vapb interaction with any of these proteins when vapb aggregates due to the als-causing p56s mutation could be responsible for the defects that lead to als <dig> disease.
