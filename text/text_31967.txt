BACKGROUND
avena sativa  belongs to the poaceae family. other cereals in this family are wheat, barley and rye  <cit> . wild oats are diploid, but all cultivated oats are hexaploid with an estimated 1c genome size of  <dig>  pg, corresponding to about  <dig> mbp  <cit> . the commercial value of oat is derived both from its high-energy grain and from superior break-crop benefits. oat plantations also have a comparatively low input demand of insecticides, fungicides and fertiliser due to high disease tolerance and low nourishment requirements of this crop  <cit> . today oat is mainly used as animal feed, but it is one of the most promising future cereals in the functional food area. it has unique and well-documented cholesterol lowering effects, as a result of its soluble dietary fibres and high β-glucan content  <cit> . an oat diet greatly improves the well feeling of persons with celiac disease and also reduces the risk of diet-related diseases  <cit> . oat is rich in natural phenolic antioxidants  <cit> , which prevent the development of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. in sweden most of the harvested oat is used for animal feed. only about  <dig> tons per year are used for human consumption. however, due to its many health-enhancing properties, the market for oat and processed oat products like oat milk for human consumption is rapidly growing.

many european countries grow winter oat, i.e. oat that is sown in the autumn and survives the winter in the field. winter oat therefore has a longer growth season compared to summer varieties, allowing an earlier harvest and giving a higher yield. however, inherently oat is not as winter hardy as rye, wheat and barley. due to the harsh climate in the scandinavian countries, winter oat is therefore not grown there. based on the english experience with winter oat, a swedish winter oat would probably increase the yield of the harvest by at least 30% . in addition, since oat is the most important rotation crop for wheat and oil crops, an early harvest of winter oat would mean an earlier sowing also of the rotation crops, resulting in increased yields also for these crops. to develop a winter oat suitable for the scandinavian climate is therefore of high priority . since cold hardiness is a quantitative trait controlled by several genes  <cit> , the traditional plant breeding programs have so far been of limited success in improving the cold hardiness for any of the important crop species  <cit>  and the swedish oat breeders have more or less given up their efforts to produce a swedish winter oat .

a cost efficient and rapid way to obtain new data from an organism with a large, complex and unknown genome is through partial sequencing of randomly selected cdna clones. the resulting collection of expressed sequence tags  reflects the level and complexity of gene expression in the sampled tissue and will also give an insight into gene structure of the chosen organism. this not only leads to the identification of a number of genes from the new organism that have known or putative functions but also to the discovery of completely novel, previously unknown putative proteins.

in this work, starting from  <dig> est sequences, we identified  <dig> putative oat genes, several of which showed similarities to genes previously defined as cold stress related or involved in transcriptional regulation, signal transduction or metabolism. several sequences that could represent new, unknown and unique oat genes were also identified. this data will now be used to study cold-acclimation in oat, to identify key genes in regulating winter survival, to produce molecular markers to facilitate the breeding for winter hardiness and to construct transgenic oat with increased freezing tolerance. these experiments will increase our general knowledge about the physiology of cold acclimation in plants in general and in oat in particular and in the long term allow the development of a scandinavian winter oat.

RESULTS
cold-acclimation
 <dig> individual, four-week old, greenhouse-grown plants of the winter oat varieties gerald, 83- <dig> ch and the spring oat varieties matilda and birgitta were incubated in the dark at +4°c  for  <dig> and  <dig> h and thereafter moved to -15°c for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h. another  <dig> individual plants were transferred directly at -15°c for  <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h. after the incubation period the plants were transferred back to the greenhouse and allowed to recover for one week. visible freezing damage was then scored on a scale from  <dig> to  <dig>  where  <dig> means no visible damage and  <dig> means a dead plant . the damage was less severe on the plants that were incubated at +4°c prior to freezing than on plants directly transferred to -15°c . thus, oat plants, as expected, are able to cold-acclimatise to some extent. a clear difference could be seen between summer and winter varieties, however, the latter being more cold adaptable and more winter hardy both before and after acclimation .

to confirm cold acclimation on the molecular level a known marker for cold acclimation was investigated. total rna was isolated from  <dig> week-old plants of the winter variety gerald after incubation at +4°c for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours. an oat sequence, corresponding to the wheat cor <dig> gene, known to be cold inducible in wheat  <cit> , was amplified by pcr from genomic oat dna. a northern analysis using rna isolated from cold induced plants and oat cor <dig> as a probe, showed that the cor <dig> gene expression could be detected after  <dig> h and then remained strongly expressed even after  <dig> h of cold incubation .

est sequencing and unigene set construction
since we aimed for both early and late cold inducible genes in our est analysis, a cdna library was constructed from pooled rna samples isolated from oat plants at different stages of cold acclimation. after plating the library, bacterial colonies were randomly picked and  <dig> single-pass sequence reactions performed on cdnas present in plasmids from these clones. this resulted in  <dig> high-quality ests of  <dig> bp or longer, with an average sequence length of  <dig> bp. the  <dig> ests were assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons, giving  <dig> candidate genes. all ests that contained rrna, mitochondrial or chloroplast sequences were excluded from further analysis. finally, the number of redundant sequences in the candidate gene set was eliminated. this was done by a comparative blastx analysis of the candidate gene set to the ncbi non-redundant  protein database . this reduced the candidate gene set to  <dig> transcripts with an average sequence length of  <dig> bp . these final genes were denoted as the asciunigene  set.

annotation and functional classification
the annotation of the asciunigene set is based on homology. each gene in the asciunigene set inherited the annotation from the best match found after a blastx search against nr protein database at ncbi. an expectation value  threshold of 10- <dig> was used. all sequences, in total  <dig>  that had e values above this threshold were annotated as unknown.

the asciunigene set was functionally classified by identifying every individual sequence in the set by the protein in the munich information centre for protein sequences  arabidopsis database  that gave the highest blastx score. since every gene in matdb is assigned to at least one of the  <dig> different classes defined by the mips functional classification system, this proved to be a fruitful way to assign putative functions for sequences in the asciunigene set. one drawback with the mips classification system is that it is somewhat crude since many of the functional classes were assigned automatically. therefore, in addition to the automated process, we manually inspected the functional classification assignments for all the proteins and re-assigned them if necessary. in this way all of the  <dig> oat sequences, out of which approximately  <dig> were manually assigned, were finally classified into the previously mentioned mips classes. the remaining  <dig> sequences  could not be assigned either automatically or manually and where therefore classified as unknown proteins .

the most abundant ests
to analyze the most abundant ests from the cold induced cdna library we grouped the sequences by means of the kog  database. this database currently includes  <dig> eukaryotic genomes, including arabidopsis. this gave a functional annotation of sequences based on orthologous proteins  <cit> . in addition we used complementary databases to annotate our sequences like fogs , which contains proteins with promiscuous domains that has not been assigned a kog identity due to unclear orthologous relationships, twogs, which contains provisional clusters of proteins that are represented in two genomes and lses, which contains proteins that are lineage-specific expansions of paralogs present in the kog database. the classification was based on best homology match of blastx searches against arabidopsis protein sequences where an expectation value  threshold of 10- <dig> was used. proteins annotated in this way were termed "kog-twog-lse". since not all arabidopsis proteins are represented in the kog database, not all ests could be annotated with a kog-twog-lse. oat ests that had a homology match in arabidopsis but not a kog-twog-lse annotation, inherited the annotation from mips annotation in matdb. in addition, several of the sequences did not have an arabidopsis homolog match with an e value above the threshold. these sequences were annotated with the best homolog match from a blastx search against the nr protein database at ncbi. again, an e value threshold of 10- <dig> was used.

as a comparison,  <dig> est sequences from a non-induced oat leaf library  <cit>  were analysed in the same way. as can be deduced from table  <dig>  the non-induced and the induced leaf libraries are quite different. in both libraries, chlorophyll a/b binding, ribulose  <dig>  5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small chain and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase  were the most expressed gene families, although in a different order . the ribulose  <dig>  5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase sequence was the most common in the non-induced library, perhaps reflecting the higher photosynthetic activity in these plants. interestingly, several cold related proteins were among the most abundant ests in the cold-acclimated library but were not represented among the most abundant ests from oat grown under optimal conditions. the cold-induced cor <dig>  is a dehydrin  <cit> . dehydrins are expressed during water-deficit and cold stress. the cold-responsive lea/rab-related cor protein  belongs to group- <dig> of lea-proteins and has previously been established as induced by cold  <cit> . other interesting proteins in this context are the auqaporin pip and hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. the aquaporins are membrane proteins that facilitate water transport across biological membranes. in arabidopsis there are  <dig> members of aquaporins that belong to the plasma membrane intrinsic protein  subgroup. recently, a study has shown that the pip proteins are either up- or down-regulated in response to various abiotic stresses  <cit> . hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins have a strong homology to osr <dig> proteins in oryza sativa, which have previously been shown to be up-regulated by salt stress  <cit> . none of these genes were present in the non-induced library, indicating the great enrichment for cold stress related genes in the induced library. since only genes that were annotated as cold induced, cold acclimated or as cold regulated were included, other stress related genes that indirectly also are involved in cold stress responses are most likely also enriched in this collection.

cold-regulated genes
in the functional classification sequences belonging to four categories; "cell rescue, defence and virulence", "cellular communication/signal transduction mechanism", "metabolism" and "transcription" were considered to be of great potential interest for cold acclimation. together these categories were represented by  <dig> entries in the asciunigene set, corresponding to more than 30% of all genes . to increase the resolution of this analysis and to improve the identification of putative cold-regulated genes we built a separate database with proteins previously reported in the literature to be directly involved in cold stress-related processes  <cit> . this "cold stress database"  presently comprises  <dig> entries. in a blastx search with the asciunigene set against csdb we identified  <dig> sequences in the asciunigene set that showed significant homology  to genes in the csdb . thus,  <dig> % of all the genes in the asciunigene set seem to be cold stress related. looking just at the two classes that we consider as most important for the cold acclimation process  almost 40% of all sequences were homologous to potential cold stress related proteins. in the "metabolism" and "cellular transport and transport mechanisms" classes, cold stress related genes were also overrepresented .

to analyze whether this high proportion of cold regulated genes in relation to the total number of genes in the asciunigene set was similar to other est collections derived from cold acclimated plants, we downloaded and analysed est datasets from cold acclimated wheat and barley. the datasets were clustered and assembled with the tgi clustering tool . this resulted in a taciunigene set of  <dig> genes and a hvciunigene set of  <dig> genes. in addition, as a comparison the same oat ests collection derived from leaves of plants grown under optimal conditions  was clustered and assembled into a asniunigene set of  <dig> sequences. these three unigene sets were then searched against the csdb. this showed that the proportions of cold stress related genes were  <dig> % in the taci candidate gene set and  <dig> % in the hvci, but only  <dig> % in the asni unigene set . thus the asci unigene set is quite different from previous oat est collections and also the est collection that contains the highest proportion of cold induced genes of all cereals.

phylogenetic analysis of ap <dig> containing proteins
among the  <dig> sequences in the transcription class ,  <dig> were found to be homologous to transcription factors. remarkably,  <dig> of these  <dig> sequences were homologous to genes in the csdb, representing almost 48% of all transcription factors found in the asciunigene set. to investigate this a bit more, the transcription factors were further classified into  <dig> different transcription factor families . dominating among these were genes encoding ap <dig> domain, homeodomain and zink finger proteins. proteins belonging to the cbf/dreb <dig> transcription factor family have previously been shown to be the regulators of the majority of cold-response genes. the cbf/dreb <dig> family belongs to the ap2/erf super family  <cit>  and in arabidopsis the ap2/erf super family comprises  <dig> proteins. based on similarities in their dna-binding domains, these proteins have been subdivided into the ap <dig>  rav, dreb and erf subfamilies and one family with the remaining proteins. in the asciunigene set, we found  <dig> sequences belonging to the ap2/erf superfamily . the ap2/erf domain of these  <dig> avena proteins were more closely analysed and also compared to  <dig> previously described ap2/erf containing proteins  <cit> . the resulting phylogenetic tree revealed that  <dig> of the oat ap2/erf proteins belonged to the dreb subfamily,  <dig> to the ap2/rav subfamily and the remaining  <dig> sequences to the erf subfamily . from the analysis it can also be deduced that the oat cbf/dreb <dig> proteins are most closely related to the monocot cbf/dreb <dig> proteins .

to further analyse relations between oat and other monocot cbf/dreb <dig> proteins, a multiple alignment of ap2/erf domains from ascbf <dig>  ascbf <dig>  ascbf <dig>  ascbf <dig>  osdreb1a, osdreb1b, hvcbf <dig>  hvcbf <dig>  hvcbf <dig>  sccbf and tadreb was made. in addition, the arabidopsis cbf/dreb sequences atcbf <dig>  atcbf <dig> and atcbf <dig> were included to further elucidate the relation between dicots and monocots in this respect . in previous studies it has been reported that in particular two amino acids, a valine at position  <dig>  and a glutamic acid at position  <dig>   in the ap2/erf domains of arabidopsis have important roles in determining dna-binding specificity  <cit> . the ascbf proteins have the conserved valine in the v <dig> position but not the glutamic acid in the e <dig> position . instead, a valine is conserved in this position. this feature is in fact shared among all included monocot cbf/dreb proteins . the monocot cbf/dreb <dig> proteins could be further divided into three subgroups . the first subgroup  contained the ascbf <dig>  hvcbf <dig>  hvcbf <dig>  sccbf, and tadreb proteins, the second subgroup  contained the ascbf <dig>  ascbf <dig> and hvcbf <dig> proteins and the third subgroup the remaining ascbf <dig>  osdreb <dig> and osdreb <dig> proteins . this grouping is based on differences in aa at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> between the different proteins . at position  <dig> the g <dig> proteins have a basic arginine  residue, the g <dig> proteins a hydrophilic asparagine  and the g <dig> proteins n, hydrophilic serine  or glycine  residues . in position  <dig> there is a basic residue, an arginine  in g <dig> and g <dig> proteins whereas g <dig> proteins have a hydrophilic residue, a glutamine  . finally g <dig> proteins have a hydrophilic tyrosine  in position  <dig> while in g <dig> and g <dig> proteins this position is occupied by a hydrophobic phenylalanine  except for ascbf <dig>  which has a basic histidine  .

expression of the ascbf genes
to explore whether the four identified oat ascbf genes were cold induced with similar kinetics as other previously described cbf genes an expression analysis was performed. multiplex rt-pcr was run on total rna isolated from leaves of three weeks old plants cold induced  at time points between  <dig> min to  <dig> h using gene specific primers for ascbf <dig>  ascbf <dig>  ascbf <dig> and ascbf <dig> respectively. total rna isolated from untreated plants at the same time points were used as a comparison. an oat actin gene  was also amplified from the same rna samples as a loading and rna quality control. to define conditions where the pcr amplification was in the exponential phase, several experiments with  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> cycles were performed. this showed that the different ascbf genes all were induced by the cold treatment but that they were differentially regulated . the ascbf <dig> gene was not detectable at time  <dig>  was induced after about  <dig> min, peaked at  <dig> hours and was completely shut off after  <dig> h. the ascbf <dig> gene had quite a different expression pattern. it was weakly expressed also in non-induced plants, but was in addition rapidly induced already at the first time point after  <dig> min. the expression levels continued thereafter to increase, peaked after about  <dig> hours but still showed an elevated expression at  <dig> h. the ascbf <dig> gene was slowly induced and not detected at all until after  <dig> hours. unlike the others its expression peaked a bit later, after  <dig> hours and then had completely declined after  <dig> h. despite several attempts, using different primer pairs we could not obtain a reproducible expression pattern of the ascbf <dig> gene . thus, the different oat ascbf genes seem to be active during different phases of the cold acclimation process and therefore perhaps induce different downstream gene programs. we are presently addressing this issue more specifically.

identification of microsatellites
using the sputnik program and threshold values as specified in the methods section, we searched for potential microsatellite  sequences in the 3716-candidate gene set. in total,  <dig> di- to pentanucleotide ssrs that fulfilled the criteria of the search were identified. this corresponds to approximately one microsatellite per  <dig> kb of sequence. using the same methods and thresholds, cardle et al.  found on average one ssr per  <dig> kb of est data in arabidopsis. this indicates that the ssr frequency in oat is similar to that in arabidopsis. in the oat sequence collection, tri-nucleotide repeats were the most commonly found followed by di-nucleotide repeats , which again matches the results from arabidopsis  <cit> . except for two exceptional ta/at ssrs of length  <dig> and  <dig> bp, ssr lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, with  <dig> and  <dig> bp being the most common.

work is now in progress to determine which of these ssrs can be reproducibly amplified by pcr, are polymorphic, and can be linked to a phenotypic marker. the vast majority of the oat ssrs were found in non-coding dna. since they nevertheless represent actively transcribed genes, we expect that several of these will turn out to be useful markers for breeding.

discussion
plant expressed sequence tags  have proven to be valuable tools in molecular biology research and a number of collections from many different plant species are now publicly available  <cit> . in cereals, which are the most important food providers on earth, several major est sequencing projects have been carried out. at the time of writing, there are  <dig>  <dig> publicly available ests from oryza sativa ,  <dig>  <dig> from triticum aestivum  and  <dig>  <dig> from hordeum vulgare . in contrast, there are only  <dig>  <dig> entries for avena sativa  and no sequences from cold acclimated oat are available. obviously, there is a great need for more est sequencing also on this important crop. here we contribute an additional  <dig>  <dig> sequences, originating from cold-acclimated oat, to the research community. since we were mainly interested in genes involved in the perception, signal transduction and early regulation of cold acclimation, we focused on short incubation times from a few minutes to  <dig> h. already after  <dig> hours acclimation, there was a clear difference in freezing tolerance between acclimated and non-acclimated plants and winter varieties were more tolerant than spring varieties . to confirm that cold induced genes were overrepresented in these plants, a northern analysis was performed on an oat gene corresponding to the previously described cold induced wheat cor <dig> gene on rna isolated from several different time points during cold acclimation at +4°c. this revealed that the diagnostic cor <dig> gene was cold induced also in oat and, interestingly, the peak expression level was higher in the winter varieties . the same tendency with earlier induction and higher expression levels was also seen for other cold induced genes .

pooled leaves from confirmed cold induced plants were used for cdna construction and est sequence generation. since leaves were used as the rna source, the most common ests in our collection represent various genes involved in photosynthesis, like chlorophyll a/b binding protein, ribulose  <dig>  5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase, photosystem i reaction centre protein, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, carbonic anhydrase/carbonate dehydrase and photosystem ii oxygen-evolving complex proteins. other well-represented sequences are those encoding ribosomal proteins . however, among the  <dig> most expressed gene families, dehydrin was also present, indicating that our collection indeed represents plants with a cold stressed induced condition. this was confirmed by a direct comparison to an est set derived from leaves of non-induced plant. in this collection, dehydrin and other cold induced genes were not among the  <dig> most highly expressed.

from our cold induced est collection, an asci unigene set of  <dig>  <dig> genes was identified. of these,  <dig>  <dig> could be placed into the functional groups defined by mips , leaving a relatively large proportion of the genes  outside of this classification. perception of the stress stimuli, transduction of the stress signal and a molecular response are necessary activities if the plant is to react to abiotic stress. in oat, however, very little is known about cold stress response at this level, although the general mechanisms are probably similar in all plants. in order to better identify oat genes involved in the cold response we therefore created a database denoted csdb , in which all genes available from the public domain and classified as cold stress responsive or cold induced were collected. when the sequences in the csdb were compared to the oat asciunigene set we found that  <dig> sequences matched, indicating that at least 14% of all the genes in the asciunigene set are involved in cold stress. among these, sequences encoding activities related to perception, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation were overrepresented . from the oat est collection generated from leaves of three weeks old oat plants grown under green house conditions we created a unigene set of  <dig> different transcripts using the same tools as with the asciunigene set. this non-induced leaf set was denoted asniunigene. when the csdb was searched with asniunigene only  <dig> % of the genes were found to be similar , a dramatic difference to the asciunigene set. these studies were extended to est collections from cold acclimated wheat and barley. by creating unigene sets  both these collections were analysed in the csdb. we then found that the amount of cold stress related genes were around 10% in both the wheat and barley collections . generalising, it seems like that at least 10% of all expressed genes in cold acclimating plants are devoted to various cellular responses needed to prepare the plant to freezing temperatures. the cold induced oat gene collection will now be a valuable new asset in further analysis of such genes.

our functional analysis of the asciunigene set showed that transcription factor genes were represented by  <dig> sequences, belonging to at least  <dig> different families . of these,  <dig> were homologous to cold-induced genes from other systems. of special importance for cold acclimation is the cbf transcription factor family. genes in this family regulate several different downstream genes, including the cor genes  <cit> . however, this regulation is complex and several different cbf genes are involved. from the asciunigene set we identified four oat cbf genes, denoted ascbf <dig>  ascbf <dig>  ascbf <dig> and ascbf <dig>  our phylogenetic and multiple alignment analysis showed that all four belonged to the monocot dreb subfamily of erf/ap <dig> domain proteins. the ascbf <dig> and ascbf <dig> genes were very closely related, while the ascbf <dig> and ascbf <dig> genes were somewhat more distantly related to each other and also belonged to a different clade than the ascbf <dig> and ascbf <dig> genes .

to investigate the expression profile of the ascbf genes, we designed gene specific primers and by rt-pcr analysis showed that these genes indeed were cold induced, but that their expression patterns were different. their expression ranged from early induction already after  <dig> min  to induction after  <dig> h  and from peaking at  <dig> h  to peaking at  <dig> h  . the ascbf <dig> was particularly interesting since it was weakly constitutively expressed, showed a clear increase in expression after cold treatment and still expressed after  <dig> h. despite several attempts using different primer pairs we could not obtain a reproducible expression pattern of the ascbf <dig> gene. the reason for this is presently not known. the complex regulation of the ascbf genes is different from what was previously described in arabidopsis  <cit>  where the atcbf <dig>  atcbf <dig>  and atcbf <dig> genes follow more or less the same expression pattern with a rapid induction after  <dig> min and a peak after  <dig> h. this indicates that cbf factors have intricate and different individual roles in inducing and maintaining cold acclimation in oat. this is corroborated by preliminary data from barley. this cereal has at least  <dig> different genes encoding cbf factors, which are all differentially regulated . thus, a more detailed analysis of the structure and regulation of cbf genes in cereals may reveal new pathways of cold induction, not present in arabidopsis.

a number of genes with hitherto unknown functions were identified in the asciunigene set. these were divided into two groups, one in which homologous or similar genes from other systems exist and one where no significant similarities could be found to any other sequence, i.e. genes that could be oat specific. in order to rule out that small "non-real" peptides contributed to this group, only sequences with open reading frames of  <dig> aa or more were included. work is now in progress to elucidate which of the  <dig> oat specific unknown genes that are induced by cold stress, drought stress or combinations of different stress factors. assuming that approx. 10% of these sequences are cold related, more than  <dig> completely new oat genes involved in cold acclimation will be present in this collection. such genes are potentially very interesting and could encode hitherto uncharacterised proteins or regulatory factors involved in cold-adaptation and freezing protection

microsatellites  are excellent dna markers for genetic mapping, since they are polymorphic, abundant, show a co-dominant inheritance and are easy to analyse by pcr  <cit> . ssrs have therefore been widely utilized in plant genomic studies  <cit> . they are especially advantageous when there is a need to track desirable traits in large-scale breeding programs and when defining anchor points for map-based gene cloning strategies. however, only a few oat ssrs are currently available. here we identify approximately  <dig> potential oat ssrs, the majority present in the non-coding part of the est sequence. work is now in progress to optimise primers for these ssrs and to identify the ones that give reliable pcr products and are polymorphic. crude genetic maps have been developed for both diploid  <cit>  and hexaploid oat  <cit> , but these maps need to be improved  <cit> . the best ssr markers will therefore be mapped to the oat genome, and linked to valuable genetic markers.

the asciunigene set will now be used to fabricate an oat biochip carrying all  <dig> identified genes. in addition, by constructing subtractive libraries, more cold-related ests will be generated. various expression studies will be performed and genes from our collection that show a rapid induction to either cold or drought will be selected for further analysis. we are especially interested in those genes in our est collection that show a very rapid induction at +4°c and have dna binding properties. especially promising genes will be tested in transgenic arabidopsis and oat systems  <cit>  and by complementing chosen arabidopsis t-dna knock-out mutants.

CONCLUSIONS
a unigene set of  <dig> genes was produced from a cold induced oat cdna library. further analysis revealed that genes related to cold stress were overrepresented in this library and that several genes could encode hitherto unknown functions. rt-pcr analyses of cbf transcription factor genes revealed that they are differentially expressed in oat and therefore might regulate different cold pathways. approx.  <dig> potential ssr markers are also present in the collection, several in non-coding regions and in close vicinity to genes involved in regulating cold acclimation.
