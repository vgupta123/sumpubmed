BACKGROUND
mouse models are currently used to research many human cancers including colon cancer. on a genome wide scale, mouse protein sequences share  <dig> % sequence identity with human counterparts 
 <cit> . with such high levels of sequence identity it may seem reasonable to expect that many orthologs between mouse and human would have conserved functions. however, in the ~ <dig> million years  of independent evolution 
 <cit> , it is possible that certain proteins have functionally diverged. one example of ortholog divergence between human and mouse is the tdp <dig> gene, required in topo1-dna complex repair, protein sequence similarity of 81%. a point mutation from an adenine to a guanine at position  <dig> in human tdp <dig> is linked with a disorder known as scan <dig> that results in cerebellar atrophy and peripheral neuropathy. however, this mutation in mouse does not result in the same condition/phenotype 
 <cit> . specific mutations in any of the following genes in human result in disease: bcl <dig>  pklr and sgca, but the same mutations in the mouse homologs do not result in phenotypic change to a disease state 
 <cit> . brca <dig> is heavily implicated in breast cancer in humans, with brca1+/− women having a 50% risk of developing breast cancer, while brca+/− mice do not exhibit increased susceptibility to cancer 
 <cit> . these observed differences in phenotype could potentially be the result of protein functional shifts in cancer-associated genes between human and mouse. while the analysis of the mouse lineage versus human is important from an evolutionary medicine perspective to determine/predict those specific cases where mouse may not effectively model the human disease phenotype, the analysis of all other lineages frames these results in the context of all mammals. therefore, in this study we have not only examined the human and mouse lineages but all lineages leading to extant species in our dataset. this allows us to gain a greater understanding of the level of lineage-specific functional shift that has occurred in colon cancer associated genes.

positive selection is the retention and spread of advantageous mutations throughout a population and has long been considered synonymous with protein functional shift. there are a number of driving forces for positive selection including external mechanisms such as adaptation to different ecological niches and response to disease and internal mechanisms such as co-evolution and compensatory mutations 
 <cit> , all of which are relevant to the data and species we are analyzing. at the molecular level, the ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site  to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  is known as ω, and indicates the selective pressure at work in that sequence. if ω >  <dig> it signifies positive selective pressure, ω =  <dig> signifies neutral evolution, while ω <  <dig> indicates purifying selective pressure. previous work assessed the level of positive selection present in mammal genomes and estimated 5%-9% of genes in mammals are under positive selection under a bayesian framework, and thus provides us with a reference or expected level of positive selection for our analysis 
 <cit> .

here we have applied a maximum likelihood method based on codon models of evolution to assess the selective pressures across our dataset 
 <cit> . these methods are far more robust than alternatives such as the sliding window approach 
 <cit> , nonetheless they do suffer from limitations and have strict criteria in terms of dataset size for statistical robustness 
 <cit> . another feature of sequence evolution that can negatively impact on a selective pressure analysis is recombination 
 <cit> . to evaluate the robustness of the likelihood ratio tests , simulations have been performed that show that type  <dig> error rates can be up to 90% with relatively high rates of recombination in protein coding sequences resulting in the misinterpretation of recombination as positive selection 
 <cit> . we have incorporated a test for recombination for all genes in the dataset prior to the ml selective pressure analysis. recent studies using these codon models of evoluton in an ml framework have combined evolutionary predictions of positive selection with biochemical verification of functional affects of these substitutions 
 <cit> , and thus support the link between positive selection and protein functional shift.

we have taken colon cancer as an example for our study given the large amount of mutation and epigenetic data available for this form of cancer 
 <cit> . lineage-specific positive selection in genes associated with colon cancer is strongly suggestive of functional shift and could have serious implications in the use of certain lineages for modeling colon cancer.

colorectal cancer  is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and second in females and we have focused on this in our study 
 <cit> . crc arises through the accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic changes. genetic changes consist of both somatic and germline  mutations. the genes in which there are germline mutations that are highly associated with the development of colon cancer are analyzed here  and are referred to throughout this manuscript as “colon cancer associated genes”. colon cancer associated genes work in conjunction with other proteins and pathways and can be thought of as contributing to, rather than being the single cause of colon cancer . epigenetic changes such as hypermethylation of certain genes, loss of imprinting and acetylation/phosphorylation/methylation of particular histones are also implicated in cancer. detailed information on colon cancer epigenetics have been made available to the community through the statepigen biomedical resource 
 <cit> . other events such as loss of heterozygosity, microsatellite instability and cpg island methylator phenotype can also play an important role.

hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer  is a hereditary predisposition for the development of colorectal cancer, and accounts for 3% of all colon cancer cases 
 <cit> . the  <dig> genes we have analyzed were selected based on the presence of known germline mutations associated with colon cancer. what follows is a brief description of each gene in the study. the genes linked with hnpcc are: mlh <dig>  pms <dig>  msh <dig>  msh <dig>  and pms <dig>  all of which are members of the mmr dna repair pathway 
 <cit> .

mlh <dig>  is a mismatch repair gene and is commonly associated with hnpcc. missense mutations in mlh <dig> occur in the c-terminal domain, which is responsible for constitutive dimerization with the mismatch repair endonuclease pms <dig> 
 <cit> . studies have also shown that microsatellite instability  is the molecular fingerprint of a deficient mismatch repair system. it is estimated that some 15% of colorectal cancers display msi owing to the epigenetic silencing of mlh <dig>  and/or germline mutation in any one of the following mismatch repair genes: pms <dig>  mlh <dig>  msh <dig>  and msh <dig> 
 <cit> . the mismatch repair endonuclease pms <dig> is known to interact with mlh <dig> and is a component of the post-replicative dna mismatch repair system . pms <dig> is recruited to cleave damaged dna this recruitment is triggered by the binding of msh <dig> and msh <dig> proteins to dsdna mismatches followed by the recruitment of mlh <dig> . pms <dig> is also involved in the repair of dna mismatches, and it can form heterodimers with mlh <dig>  additional genes in our study include the tumor suppressor gene tp <dig>  cdh <dig>  mutyh, and apc. tp <dig> is a hub protein in the cellular dna damage response pathway known as the p <dig> signaling pathway 
 <cit> , it is linked with colorectal cancer and many other cancers. the genes cdh <dig>  mutyh, and apc also interact with one another in addition to their involvement in the mmr pathway described above. for example, cdh <dig> and apc combine to act as a ubiquitin ligase, which is involved in glycolysis regulation during the cell cycle 
 <cit> . in fact, most of the colon cancer associated genes in this study can be grouped into critical pathways, such as apoptosis, dna damage control, and cell cycle signaling 
 <cit> . 

to assess if there is evidence for protein functional shift from the patterns of substitution in colon cancer associated genes we have carried out selective pressure analyses using codon models of lineage-specific rate heterogeneity.

methods
sequence data assembled
the colon cancer gene dataset used in this study consists of  <dig> genes taken from the cancer gene census at the sanger institute 
 <cit> . all  <dig> genes have reported cases of germline mutations that are associated with colon cancer . using compara data from ensembl 
 <cit> , single gene orthologs were identified for each gene across the vertebrate genomes chosen. the  <dig> species were selected based on genome coverage. these included representatives from  <dig> of the  <dig> main lineages of eutheria, namely afrotheria, euarchontoglires, and laurasiatheria, as well as outgroup species including platypus, zebrafish, and zebra finch . 

each of the  <dig> genes analyzed in this study are detailed, including their hgnc approved gene symbols, and ensembl gene ids. the total number of species analyzed for each gene and the overall length of alignment in base pairs are also given. the syndrome, tumor type observed and pathway involved are detailed. references citing alternative gene names are identified using rounded parentheses.

multiple sequence alignment
the coding dna sequences of the single gene orthologs were translated and the resulting amino acid sequences were aligned using the default parameters in clustalw  <dig> . <dig> 
 <cit> . we mapped gaps from the amino acid multiple sequence alignment  to the corresponding nucleotide sequences to produce a nucleotide alignment. all alignments were reviewed for quality and any poorly aligned regions were manually edited using se-al 
 <cit> . all alignments are available in additional file 
 <dig> 

alignment criteria for selective pressure analysis
it has been shown through computer simulations that sequence length has an impact on the power to infer positive selection 
 <cit> . power was also found to increase with greater taxonomic representation and greater divergence, although extreme levels of divergence were found to cause a reduction in power. simulations have shown that the presence of longer foreground branches also increased the power of the test statistic, but extremely long foreground branches reduced the power 
 <cit> . to increase the statistical power of the analyses performed here we have therefore only considered single gene families containing  <dig> or more taxa, and alignment lengths of greater than  <dig> amino acids.

recombination analysis
recombination events can result in the incorrect detection of positive selection. to reduce the detection of potential false positives from our analyses, we have implemented geneconv  
 <cit> . geneconv detects gene conversion events between ancestors of sequences in a multiple sequence alignment. default parameters where employed, and  <dig>  randomly permuted datasets were generated for each single gene orthologous family and global inner fragments were listed if p-value <=  <dig>  or smaller.

selective pressure analysis using codon models of evolution
selective pressure analyses were performed using codeml from paml version  <dig>  
 <cit> . because each gene family analyzed was composed of single gene orthologs, pruned species phylogenies were used as per previous publications 
 <cit> . codeml implements a number of codon-based models in a maximum likelihood framework that can be used to test alternative and nested evolutionary hypotheses. three different types of codon model were used in this study:  a homogeneous model  - a single ω-value is estimated for the entire alignment;  site-heterogeneous models - the sites of the gene sequence are grouped into two or more site classes, each with its own ω-value; and  lineage-specific heterogeneous models - a different ω parameter is estimated for different site classes in combination with different lineages 
 <cit> .

seven site-heterogeneous models were used, we have retained conventional annotations for these models: model 1a , model 2a , model  <dig> discrete , model  <dig> discrete , model  <dig>  model  <dig> and model 8a. two lineage-specific heterogeneous models were used: model a and model a null. these models have been applied similarly elsewhere 
 <cit> .

the goodness-of-fit of the different models was assessed statistically using a likelihood ratio test . the lrt compares the log-likelihoods of a null model with the alternative model. for hierarchically nested models, the test statistic of an lrt approximates the χ <dig> distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of additional free parameters in the alternative model compared to the null model. because of this, the critical value of the test statistic can be determined from standard statistical tables. if the p-value of the test statistic exceeds that critical value , then the null model can be rejected. for example, if the test statistic of an lrt comparing model 1a  with model 2a  is greater than the critical value determined from the χ <dig> distribution, model  <dig> a can be rejected. if ω1 >  <dig> under model 2a, positive selection may be inferred. additional file 
 <dig> shows the set of lrts used for selective pressure analysis.

in cases where positive selection is inferred, the posterior probability of a site belonging to the positively selected class is estimated using two calculations: naïve empirical bayes  or bayes empirical bayes . if both beb and neb are predicted, we will preferentially use the beb results as these have been shown to be more robust 
 <cit> .

in-house software was designed to prepare all files for analysis and to process all output. paml output files were parsed for parameter estimates and log likelihood values, and lrts were performed . where positively selected sites were inferred under a given model, positively selected sites were mapped to the sequence  of interest and included in the summary file . this software was used to reduce the scope for human error in setting up and interpreting paml analyses and is available from the authors on request. functional annotation of sites under positive selection for each protein was obtained from uniprot 
 <cit> .

human population analysis
selective pressures within the present day human population were analyzed for those genes with evidence of lineage-specific positive selection in the human ancestral lineages. the online tool snp@evolution <dig> and hapmap release ii source data was used to look at variations within the east asian , northern and western european , and african yoruba  populations. the “integrated haplotype score” or ihs, described first in 
 <cit> , was employed here as a test for directional selection. the ihs is standardized using genome wide empirical distributions, it has an approximate normal distribution allowing for direct comparisons of the score across genes, and it outperforms in comparison to other available approaches 
 <cit> . a derived allele that has been segregating in the population receives a large ihs  while a large negative ihs  indicates that the derived allele has increased in frequency.

RESULTS
starting with a dataset of  <dig> genes, we identified single gene orthologs across  <dig> complete vertebrate genomes. ortholog identification resulted in families with between  <dig> and  <dig> taxa, and alignment lengths of between  <dig> and  <dig>  base pairs thus satisfying the criteria described in the materials and methods section. the test for recombination on all  <dig> genes is summarized in additional file 
 <dig>  the analysis revealed that only the tp <dig> protein showed significant levels of recombination, the regions where recombination was present were noted and compared to regions where positive selection was detected. if these regions overlapped - the positive selection result was deemed a false positive.

to assess the selective pressure variation, we performed both site- and lineage-specific selective pressure analyses and subsequently assessed the statistical significance of all results via lrt analyses to ascertain the codon evolutionary model of best fit. in those cases where the ω value vastly exceeds  <dig>  we have simply denoted them as ω > >  <dig> throughout the manuscript, as there is no biological significance for these extremely large ω values . the lineage-specific analyses are more pertinent to the main focus of the paper, i.e. - the identification of species-specific patterns of substitution in these colon cancer associated genes. therefore the lineage-specific results have been described in detail in the following section. site-specific results are briefly summarized on a gene-by-gene basis. all positively selected sites were assessed using functional information from the uniprot database 
 <cit> . the model of best fit along with associated parameter estimates are described and a summary table for each of the  <dig> genes is given in additional file 
 <dig> 

lineage-specific selective pressure analyses
lineage-specific models of codon evolution were assessed at multiple phylogenetic depths,  the extant lineages within the euarchontoglires clade, and , all ancestral lineages leading from the euarchontoglires to modern mouse and human were also tested independently as depicted in figure 
 <dig>  analysis of the extant human and mouse lineages did not yield evidence of positive selection. conversely, analysis of the lineages within the euarchontoglires clade resulted in significant evidence of lineage-specific positive selection,  <dig> genes in ancestral lineages and  <dig> in extant lineages, see figure 
 <dig>  the stk <dig> gene showed evidence of positive selection in the euarchontoglires ancestral lineage and again in the hominidae ancestral lineage. cdh <dig> showed patterns of substitution conducive with positive selection in the ancestral primate lineage. in the ancestral muridae lineage there is evidence for positive selection acting on the tsc <dig> gene. the ancestral murinae lineage showed evidence of positive selection for both msh <dig> and sdhc, see table 
 <dig> for summary.

the model of best fit is summarized below for those genes with evidence of positive selection. the lineage-specific results for each lineage tested from the euarchontoglires ancestor to modern lineages are shown in the top panel and the site-specific results are shown in the bottom panel. the model abbreviations are as per main text. p refers to the number of free parameters estimated in that model. beb = bayes empirical bayes estimations. the number of positively selected sites identified can be found the final column, sites are separated by the posterior probability cutoffs of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

in the following section, we have analyzed the positively selected sites for those genes with evidence of lineage-specific positive selection in the context of their potential functional relevance for those genes. this was carried out for all genes where functional sites and/or domains have been elucidated. all sites described were calculated via bayes empirical bayes  analysis . in all cases we are assessing the potential functional importance of residues based on their sequence position. there are instances where we identify stretches of protein sequence under positive selection - there is a possibility that these sites may have very different functions despite their sequence position. for a total  <dig> of the  <dig> genes there were partial or complete 3d structures available. however, many of the positively selected sites identified were located in regions that were not yet fully resolved at the structural level, and so only the 3d model for stk <dig> is given. 

positive selection in the euarchontoglires ancestral branch
the most ancestral branch tested was the euarchontoglires ancestral branch, i.e. the ancestor of the primate, rodent and glires clades as depicted in figure 
 <dig>  the stk <dig> alignment consists of  <dig> taxa and was the only gene that showed evidence of positive selection in this ancestral lineage. stk <dig>  plays an essential role in g <dig> cell cycle arrest and acts as a tumor suppressor. it phosphorylates and activates members of the ampk-related subfamily of protein kinases 
 <cit> ,). mutations in stk <dig> cause peutz-jeghers syndrome , this is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and an increased risk of various neoplasms including gastrointestinal cancer 
 <cit> . from the literature we currently know of  <dig> sites across this gene that when mutated are associated with colon-cancer. the euarchontoglires ancestral lineage has  <dig> % of sites under positive selection . the positively selected residues were located on the 3d structure of this enzyme . position  <dig> with a posterior probability  =  <dig>  is a hydrophobic alanine or valine in euarchontoglires species and is a negatively charged glutamic acid or positively charged lysine in non-euarchontoglires species. this residue also lies in close proximity to sporadic cancer site a205t and colorectal cancer site d208n in human 
 <cit> . positively selected position  <dig> in euarchontoglires  is present in euarchontoglires species as an arginine residue and all non-euarchontoglires as an uncharged glutamine residue. site  <dig> is close to r297k and region 303– <dig> both of which have been implicated in pjs 
 <cit> .

positive selection in the primate ancestral branch
the branch leading from the euarchontoglires ancestor towards the primates was analyzed, we have termed this branch the ancestral primate branch as depicted in figure 
 <dig>  the cdh <dig> dataset consists of  <dig> taxa and following lrt analyses showed evidence of lineage-specific positive selection in  <dig> % of sites in the primate ancestor . positively selected sites were compared to human swiss-prot entry  and it was found that position  <dig>  with a pp of  <dig> , falls in close proximity to gastric cancer variant r598q 
 <cit> . at position  <dig> primates have a negatively charged glutamic acid while non-primates have a polar uncharged glutamine.

positive selection in the hominidae ancestral branch
the next branch in the primate clade is that leading to modern great apes, i.e. hominidae, as depicted in figure 
 <dig>  this lineage also showed evidence of positive selection again in the stk <dig> gene in  <dig> % of sites, with ω > >  <dig>  see figure 
 <dig> and table 
 <dig>  the positively selected positions were compared to the human swiss-prot sequence . position  <dig> represents a radical substitution, as the hominidae code for an alanine  whereas the murinae lineage encode an arginine at this position . for positively selected site  <dig>  the ancestral hominidae lineage encodes the polar residue serine, while the closely related species studied encode the small amphiphilic glycine. the functions of these specific sites have not been reported thus far in the literature but are likely to be of considerable interest as they mark adaptations unique to the ancestral hominidae.

a second gene showing evidence of positive selection in the hominidae ancestral branch is the vhl dataset consisting of  <dig> taxa. the vhl gene encodes von hippel-lindaue tumour suppressor protein. mutations occurring in this gene can result in von hippel-lindau disease  - a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome 
 <cit> . vhl exhibited weak evidence of positive selection with  <dig> % of sites in the ancestral hominidae lineage under positive selection. there was one amino acid that had low coverage in the alignment , as this is a very weak results we have not expanded upon it any further.

positive selection in the extant primate branches
analysis of modern non-human primates also identified positive selection in a number of genes. in vhl positive selection was detected in the chimpanzee lineage where  <dig> % of sites have ω > >  <dig>  and also in the marmoset lineage where  <dig> % sites have ω > >  <dig>  sites under positive selection were compared against human swiss-prot entry , however the region  was only represented by 11/ <dig> species in the alignment and therefore we do not have sufficient confidence in these positions to explore these sites in more detail.

the msh <dig> gene dataset contained  <dig> taxa and showed evidence of positive selection in both the gorilla and marmoset lineages each displaying  <dig> % of sites with ω > >  <dig>  gorilla and marmoset extant lineages were compared against human  swiss-prot entry. no relevant functional information could be extracted from positively selected sites in gorilla, however 2/ <dig> positively selected sites in marmoset fall in close proximity to cancer variants. in marmoset, positively selected site  <dig>  coincides with human colorectal cancer variants d803g 
 <cit>  and v800a 
 <cit> . position  <dig> in marmoset is a negatively charged glutamic acid while in all other mammals it is a small negatively charged aspartic acid. positively selected site  <dig> in marmoset  is located between human colorectal cancer variants r1095h 
 <cit>  and t1110c 
 <cit> .

msh <dig> alignment consists of  <dig> taxa. the function of the msh <dig> protein is in post-replicative dna mismatch repair system . mutations in msh <dig> result in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer type  <dig>  
 <cit> . lineage-specific positive selection was identified in  <dig> % of sites within the extant gorilla lineage with ω > >  <dig>  positively selected sites were compared against human swiss-prot sequence . all  <dig> of the beb identified sites occur between amino acid position 124– <dig> which overlaps with the region containing variants n127s, n139s and i145m associated with hnpcc <dig> 
 <cit> .

tuberous sclerosis  <dig> protein  interacts with tsc <dig> protein and mutations in this gene can cause tuberous sclerosis type  <dig> 
 <cit> . the alignment of tsc <dig> consisted of  <dig> taxa. lineage-specific positive selection was identified in the following extant lineages, the percentage of sites under positive selection in each lineage is shown in brackets, in all cases ω > > 1: chimpanzee lineage , gorilla , orangutan , and, marmoset . positively selected sites were compared against human swiss-prot sequence  however the functional information was not available to contextualize these results.

atm acts as a dna checkpoint sensor by activating checkpoint signaling upon double strand breaks 
 <cit> . the alignment of atm consisted of  <dig> taxa and positive selection was detected in the following lineages : gorilla , marmoset , and rabbit . beb significant sites were compared to human  and mouse  swiss-prot entries to determine the functional relevance of selected sites. in the gorilla lineage positively selected site  <dig> , where in humans a substitution of alanine to aspartate in this same position can result in ataxia telangiectasia  which is a severe disease that causes weakened immune function and greater predisposition to cancer 
 <cit> . no other functionally relevant information was found upon comparison of swiss-prot information against either marmoset or rabbit.

the extant orangutan lineage also showed evidence of positive selection in the tsc <dig> gene for  <dig> % of its alignment . positively selected sites were compared against human swiss-prot sequence  and mouse swiss-prot sequence  however there was insufficient information to extrapolate the potential functional impact of these sites.

human population level analysis using hapmap data
genes displaying evidence of positive selection in lineages leading to homo sapiens, i.e. the primate and hominidae lineages , were further analyzed to determine if there is evidence for ongoing positive directional selection in modern day human populations. the integrated haplotype score, ihs 
 <cit> , was calculated for each snp in stk <dig>  cdh <dig> and vhl genes across african yorubu , east asian  and european  populations. one intronic snp in the sdk <dig> gene, had an ihs score of + <dig>  in european populations. in the cdh <dig> gene, two intronic snps with ihs scores of + <dig>  and + <dig>  respectively were identified in the east asian populations. ihs scores of greater than + <dig> indicate that these alleles are segregating at a significant rate within their given populations. no population level directional selection was identified in the vhl gene in modern humans.

positive selection in the ancestral muridae branch
the ancestral muridae branch marks the most recent common ancestor of modern mouse, rat and guinea pig species and is depicted in figure 
 <dig>  tuberous sclerosis  <dig> protein  interacts with tsc <dig> and acts as a tumour suppressor gene 
 <cit> . defects in tsc <dig> cause tuberous sclerosis type  <dig> which is an autosomal dominant multi-system disorder. there were a total of  <dig> taxa analysed in for the tsc <dig> gene and  <dig> % of sites in the muridae ancestral lineage were identified with ω > >  <dig>  as before for tsc1: positively selected sites were compared against human swiss-prot sequence  and mouse swiss-prot sequence  however there was insufficient information to extrapolate potential functional impacts of these sites.

positive selection in the ancestral murinae branch
the ancestral murinae branch defines the most recent common ancestor of mouse and rat. in total there were two genes identified as being under positive selection in the murinae lineage. the first is the msh <dig> gene that acts as a dna mismatch repair protein and is a component of the post–replicative dna mismatch repair system 
 <cit> . msh <dig> also heterodimerizes with msh <dig> to form muts-alpha, a protein complex that functions by binding to dna mismatches and initiating dna repair 
 <cit> . mutations in msh <dig> have been reported to cause hnpcc type  <dig> 
 <cit> , atypical hnpcc, and familial colorectal cancers  
 <cit> . the msh <dig> dataset consists of  <dig> taxa. lineage-specific analysis of the ancestral murinae lineage revealed  <dig> % of the sites  in msh <dig> under positive selection, ω > >  <dig> . the corresponding swiss-prot sequence  lacked functional details for these positions, therefore, potential functional effects remain unknown. however, examination of the alignment at this position revealed the substitution of residues with unrelated biochemical properties at these positions. at positively selected site  <dig> , the murinae lineage has a proline whereas remaining species tested encode either glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or lysine. as proline produces “kinks” in the α-helical regions of proteins, such a substitution could alter the protein structure substantially. positively selected site  <dig> is a leucine in the murinae, all other non-outgroup species encode aliphatic residues . the ancestral murinae has a cysteine at swiss-prot position  <dig> while all other species have an alanine at this position. these residues are of specific interest for further in vitro functional assaying given their uniqueness to the rodent clade and their retention in all modern rodents tested.

the second gene with evidence of positive selection on the ancestral murinae lineage is the sdhc  gene. the sdhc function is to act as a membrane-anchoring subunit for the sdh protein. defects in this protein are reported in paragangliomas and gastric stromal sarcomas 
 <cit> . the dataset for the sdhc consists of  <dig> taxa. lineage-specific positive selection was detected in the ancestral murinae lineage with  <dig> % of sites  in this protein with ω > >  <dig> . comparison with the human sequence from swiss-prot  and mouse sequence  placed  <dig> of these sites either in transmembrane or topological domains across the gene, with the additional positively selected residue  neighboring a metal binding site at position  <dig> 

positive selection in the extant rabbit branch
the sdhc gene again showed evidence of positive selection, this time in the extant rabbit lineage with  <dig> % of sites under positive selection . 15/ <dig> positively selected sites were identified as occurring within  <dig> amino acid positions of the metal binding site  <dig>  also mentioned in the ancestral murinae analysis. while there are extremely high levels of positive selection identified in the rabbit lineage, no other relevant functional information could be gleaned from the databases at this point.

the mutyh alignment consisted of  <dig> taxa and showed evidence of lineage-specific positive selection in  <dig> % of sites in the extant rabbit lineage . positively selected sites were compared to human  and mouse  swiss-prot entries, however no relevant functional information could be extrapolated. radical substitutions occurred in all  <dig> beb sites in the extant rabbit lineage, three of which are at positions 485– <dig> in the nudix hydrolase domain.

the mlh <dig> gene codes for a critical protein involved with the post-replicative dna mismatch repair system. defects in this gene result in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer type  <dig>  
 <cit> . the alignment of mlh <dig> consists of  <dig> taxa and again positive selection was detected in the extant rabbit lineage in  <dig> % of sites . positively selected sites were compared against human swiss-prot sequence  and mouse swiss-prot sequence . at amino acid position  <dig>  rabbit has a polar uncharged serine residue while all other species tested have a hydrophobic alanine residue. this positively selected site falls in a region dense with hnpcc <dig> variants at positions a111v, t116k, t117m, y126n, a128p 
 <cit> . positively selected residues in rabbit:  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  each fall within  <dig> amino acid positions of hnpcc <dig> variants: v213m, r474q and v506a 
 <cit> . and position  <dig> identified as under positive selection also lies in close proximity to a colorectal cancer variant r472i 
 <cit> .

finally, the bhd gene showed evidence of positive selection in the extant rabbit lineage. the function of the bhd gene is still largely unknown, however it is thought that it may be a tumour suppressor and it may be involved in colorectal tumorigenesis 
 <cit> . the alignment consisted of  <dig> taxa and positive selection was detected in  <dig> % of sites , again unique to the rabbit lineage. beb significant sites were compared to human  and mouse  swiss-prot entries to determine their functional relevance. all  <dig> of the positively selected sites in rabbit occur in a small region from position 61– <dig> and border a known human cancer variant at position  <dig> that when mutated from serine to tryptophan results in sporadic colorectal carcinoma.

positive selection in the extant rodent and guinea pig branches
madh <dig> is the co-activator and mediator of signal transduction by tgf-beta. defects in madh <dig> result in pancreatic, colorectal, juvenile polyposis syndrome, juvenile intestinal polyposis and primary pulmonary hypertension 
 <cit> . the rat lineage has lineage-specific positive selection in the madh <dig> gene where  <dig> % of sites are evolving with ω > >  <dig> . positively selected sites were compared to human  and mouse  swiss-prot entries. the majority of positively selected residues in this protein are sequential with 18/ <dig> sites under positive selection in the rat lineage within  <dig> amino acid positions of the natural human variant  <dig>  when position  <dig> is mutated from aspartate to histidine pancreatic carcinoma is induced 
 <cit> .

nf <dig> is thought to be a regulator of ras activity 
 <cit> . defects in nf <dig> can cause colorectal carcinoma and breast cancer 
 <cit> . the nf <dig> dataset consists of  <dig> taxa. lineage-specific positive selection was identified in  <dig> % of sites in rat  and  <dig> % of sites in guinea pig . beb significant sites were compared to human  and mouse  swiss-prot sequences, however there was no functionally relevant information available.

tsc <dig> also shows evidence of positive selection in the extant guinea pig lineage where  <dig> % of the sites have ω > >  <dig>  as before, the positively selected sites were compared against human swiss-prot sequence  and mouse swiss-prot sequence  however there was insufficient information to extrapolate potential functional impacts of these sites.

results of site-specific selective pressure analyses
the site-specific results may be beneficial to those working on rational mutagenesis and/or the identification of functionally important regions in these colon cancer associated genes and so these results have been summarized. we have identified five genes that have signatures of site-specific positive selection, namely: cdh <dig>  mutyh, pms <dig>  pms <dig> and tp <dig>  representing ~23% of the dataset. for each of these five genes, the model of best fit was the site-heterogeneous model “model 8”, see table 
 <dig> for summary.

defects in the cdh <dig> member of the cadherin family are linked to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer 
 <cit> . the cdh <dig> alignment contained  <dig> taxa and site-specific analyses revealed  <dig> % sites evolving under strong positive selection, ω =  <dig> , see table 
 <dig>  we compared these sites to the human swiss-prot entry  to obtain relevant functional information, see figure 
 <dig>  the vast majority of positively selected sites  in the protein are within the extracellular topological domain . many of these positively selected sites are in close proximity to natural cancer variants. for example, position  <dig> is under position selection and resides within a region  known to be missing in gastric carcinoma samples 
 <cit> . positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are under positive selection and map in close proximity to natural variant e463q found in gastric carcinoma samples 
 <cit> . position  <dig> resides within the metalloproteinase cleavage site  of cdh <dig>  position  <dig> is in close proximity to a gamma-secretase/ps <dig> cleavage site  
 <cit> , and position  <dig> is in close proximity to a glycosylation site , essential for the posttranslational modification of proteins 
 <cit> . in the cdh <dig> gene, the majority of species tested  have hydrophobic residues  at position  <dig>  the glires group  have small residues , but human, gorilla, and dog have large aromatic residues  that could significantly alter the protein structure and may affect binding at the glycosylation site at position  <dig> 

the mutyh dataset consisted of  <dig> taxa and site-specific analysis identified  <dig> sites under positive selection , representing  <dig> % of the mutyh protein . a total of  <dig> unique sites are reported as natural cancer variants in human , see figure 
 <dig>  positively selected sites  <dig> and  <dig> are in close proximity to natural cancer variants at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  positively selected sites  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> also map in close proximity to natural variants,  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. also of note are the replacement substitutions observed at swiss-prot positions  <dig> and  <dig>  these are radical with potential effects on protein structure. at position  <dig> there is a large aromatic trytophan in primates, and a hydrophobic leucine and valine present in the glires. at position  <dig> there is an hydrophobic leucine in primates and a positively charged histidine in the glires.

pms <dig>  encodes a dna mismatch repair protein and this dataset consists of  <dig> taxa. defects in pms <dig> are reported to cause hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer type  <dig>  
 <cit> . analysis of pms <dig> identified site-specific model of codon evolution model  <dig> as best fit, estimating  <dig> positively selected sites  with ω =  <dig>  . we compared these sites against human swiss-prot sequence p <dig>  positively selected site  <dig> resides in close proximity to position  <dig> - a natural variant  reported in incomplete hnpcc and hnpcc <dig> 
 <cit> . due to limited functional data it was unfeasible to study the remaining  <dig> sites. however, due to pms <dig> function in dna mismatch repair, these positively selected sites could prove ideal as candidates for mutagenesis studies in the future.

mismatch repair endonuclease pms <dig>  is a component of the post-replicative dna mismatch repair system 
 <cit> . defects in pms <dig> are reported in hnpcc 
 <cit> . the pms <dig> dataset contained  <dig> taxa and site-specific analysis identified  <dig> % of sites under positive selection in this pms <dig> protein, ω =  <dig>  . functional relevance of these sites was determined by comparison to human swiss-prot sequence . the vast majority of sites  reside within the 430– <dig> region of the alignment. this region of the alignment is highly variable and could not be not improved manually. functional characterization for this region is also lacking and therefore we could not assess functional relevance. outside this region, two positively selected sites,  <dig> and  <dig>  flank a phosphoserine modification site  
 <cit> . both substitutions are radical and could affect the function at position  <dig> 

tp <dig>  acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing apoptosis or arresting growth depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type 
 <cit> . the tp <dig> protein  is  <dig> residues in length with  <dig> of these sites reported as natural variants that cause/lead to cancer including but not limited to colorectal and gastric cancers 
 <cit> . in our analysis of tp <dig> we have  <dig> taxa. mutations in this gene radically affect function and therefore we would expect to find evidence of strong purifying selection across sites and lineages. however, results indicate that site specific positive selection is at work with  <dig> sites under positive selection, ω =  <dig> . see figure 
 <dig> and table 
 <dig> for detailed analyses. on inspection of these  <dig> sites, we determine that  <dig> are located within the first region of the protein , a region responsible for interaction with the methyltransferase hrmt1l <dig> and the recruiting of promoters to the tp <dig> gene 
 <cit> . we identified a cluster of positively selected sites, namely positions  <dig> and  <dig>  along with an additional  <dig> sites within ten residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . mutation of position  <dig> can abolish phosphorylation by hipk <dig> and acetylation of k- <dig> by crebbp 
 <cit> . region 66– <dig> of tp <dig> is involved in interaction with wwox protein and we have identified two sites , under positive selection within this region. positively selected position  <dig>  is located within a region reported to interact with hipk <dig>  and axin <dig> , and in addition is also located within a region  that is required for interaction with fbx <dig>  positively selected residue  <dig> is located within the carm <dig> interaction region , the hipk <dig> interacting region , and the oligomerization region .

CONCLUSIONS
the results we have presented are indicative of selective pressures acting in a lineage-specific manner. the positively selected sites we have identified in this study frequently reside in regions of functional importance, such as glycosylation sites, protease cleavage sites, and sites known to interact with proteins involved in dna damage repair pathways. also of note, positively selected residues are frequently located at, or in close proximity to, known cancer associated sites although the statistical significance of these coincidences cannot be concluded with such a small sample sizes. larger sample sizes and more complete functional information will be hugely beneficial in resolving whether these positively selected residues are most likely positioned to or at variants associated with cancer.

in using the mouse as a model organism for colon cancer, we are making an assumption that the orthologs in both species are functioning in precisely the same way despite ~  <dig> my of independent evolution. we found no evidence of functional divergence in the extant human and mouse lineages for the genes analyzed. however, upon testing the lineages leading from the mrca of mouse and human, i.e. euarchontoglires, positive selection has occurred on certain ancestral branches and in specific extant lineages. in the ancestral lineages of primates, rodents and glires there is evidence of positive selection in  <dig> of the  <dig> genes tested . in total, considering all lineages analyzed including extant lineages, we have detected lineage-specific positive selection in 64% of the genes analyzed . studies on the levels of polymorphism observed in drosophila species indicate that positive selection is pervasive in this species with positive selection present in ~25% of the genes 
 <cit> . previous studies on the levels of positive selection in primates compared to rodents and in the hominidae reveal much lower levels of positive selection in the range of 5-9% of genes in the genome 
 <cit> . if these previous analyses were to act as a measurement of expectation then we should have identified only  <dig> gene under positive selection in this dataset that is comprised of mammals for the most part .

on grouping the cancer associated genes according to their involvement in functional pathways we determined that the mmr dna damage response pathway has evidence of positive selection in  <dig> components of the pathway –  <dig> of which are site-specific and one of which is specific to the ancestral murinae lineage suggesting a specific selective pressure in this clade for this process. the site-specific analyses identified a total of  <dig> genes that are positively selected: cdh <dig>  mutyh, pms <dig>  pms <dig> and tp <dig>  these results are important for contributing to our understanding of fundamental functions of these proteins and have provided potential targets for rational mutagenesis.

overall, these results indicate that the function of certain proteins associated with colon cancer display distinct lineage-specific patterns of substitution indicative of positive selection in the ancestral human and mouse lineages. there are a number of selective pressures on any given protein that can contribute to patterns of substitution that are “falsely” indicative of positive selection. the necessity to continue to interact with protein partners may be a strong driving force in the evolution of the proteins in this study as many form functional complexes with one another or other proteins 
 <cit> . compensatory mutations may also contribute to elevated levels of ω 
 <cit> . the effective population size  of the species tested vary enormously, with estimations for modern human populations in the range of ne =  <dig>  to  <dig>  
 <cit> , while estimations for modern mouse populations range from ne =  <dig>  to  <dig>  
 <cit>  and this large difference in ne may also contribute to detection of false positives. we have also detected weak evidence for ongoing selective pressure in the human genome on the stk <dig> and cdh <dig>  but these signals of selection may be artifacts of the very small effective population size of modern humans. smaller ne values are associated with increased fixation of slightly deleterious substitutions and subsequent elevated ω values 
 <cit> . such slightly deleterious mutations in turn can lead to additional compensatory substitutions that become fixed. teasing apart substitutions that have become fixed due to positive selection from slightly deleterious substitutions fixed due to small ne[ <cit>  will aid in a more complete understanding of protein evolution in the future.
