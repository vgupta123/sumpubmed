BACKGROUND
shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> , previously designated alteromonas putrefaciens mr- <dig> or shewanella putrefaciens strain mr- <dig>  is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacterium with a single unsheathed polar flagellum  <cit> . the strain mr- <dig>  isolated from oneida lake in new york, shows bioremediation potential and metabolically versatile properties. under aerobic conditions, s. oneidensis utilizes oxygen as the final electron acceptor; nevertheless, s. oneidensis undertakes respiration by reducing alternative terminal electron acceptors such as nitrite, sulfite, fumarate, metals , and radionuclides  under anaerobic environment  <cit> . the remarkable anaerobic respiratory plasticity  involves many genes. in this study, we only considered a subset, cyma, mtra, mtrb, omcb , omca, gspf, and gspd genes  <cit> .

the functions of these arp genes have been characterized. the gene cyma  encodes a cytoplasmic membrane-bound, tetraheme cytochrome c that serves as an entry point for electron flow from the cytoplasm to decaheme cytochrome c, encoded by mtra   <cit> . the electrons are relayed through the periplasm to the outer membrane  protein encoded by the gene mtrb   <cit> , which also plays a role required for the proper localization and insertion of cytochromes omcb  and omca  into the om  <cit> . omcb interacts directly with omca to form a stable complex as part of the electron transport pathway  <cit> . omca is a cell surface-exposed lipoprotein, that has been shown to be involved in the process of electron transfer to electrodes in microbial fuel cells   <cit> . on the cell surface, exposure of the omca allows it to directly contact with extracellular electron acceptors  <cit> . both genes gspf  and gspd  encode individual components of the type ii secretion system . pseudopilus apparatus of t2s, whose formation can be regulated by gspf, delivers omcb and omca from periplasm across gspd into the surroundings where the omcb-omca complex is constructed  <cit> .

we are interested in studying how the cell coordinate the expression of these seven arp genes. there are a total of  <dig>  predicted protein-encoding open reading frames  in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  comprising a circular chromosome and an iteron-type plasmid with  <dig>  and  <dig> cdss respectively  <cit> . genome-wide gene expression profiling has been a powerful method in elucidating the gene regulation patterns in cells  <cit> . for example, the well-known yeast gene expression dataset  <cit> , originally collected for finding cell cycle-regulated genes, has been used by some authors to study biological mechanisms beyond the cell-cycle events  <cit> . inspired by such successes, we searched ncbi gene expression omnibus  <cit>  for experiments performed on the strain mr- <dig> and found three such datasets, series gse <dig>  gse <dig>  and gse <dig>  they were generated by the spotted cdna microarray method. we combined these three gene expression datasets to form a full dataset  with  <dig> conditions for investigation. our aim is to study how the expression of the aforementioned genes of electron transfer are coregulated and how they may interact with other genes. we employed the new bioinformatic tool, liquid association , to conduct the data analysis  <cit> .

la can be viewed as an extension of the traditional correlation measure which is commonly employed in gene expression studies for identifying gene clusters. genes with similar expression profiles, as reflected by significant correlation coefficient, tend to form common structure components, to be regulated by common transcription elements, and to participate in the same biological pathways. however, many functionally associated genes are uncorrelated in expression  <cit> . la is a method for identifying higher order association between variables in complex systems. it is particularly useful when the correlation between two variables x, y is weakened due to the mediation by a third variable z. la depicts how the pattern of correlation between x and y, including its sign and strength, is mediated by z.

we uploaded gpl3253_cia to the la online computing system. we used each pair of the arp genes as the lead, x and y, to generate a short list of genes z with the highest la scores. through the genes which mediate the correlation patterns of arp genes, we hope to unravel some biological pathways important to electron transfer process. after examining the la output, one gene chea- <dig> stood out from a pool of near  <dig> genes in the genome as the best la score gene. examination of the genome of mr- <dig> showed that this bacterium has two uninterrupted chemotaxis  genes, designated chea- <dig>  and chea- <dig>   <cit> . chea , together with chew and chez can control the level of phosphorylation of chey, which regulates flagellar motion  <cit> . on the other hand, at least five studies had shown that mr- <dig> responds chemotactically to a wide range of anaerobic electron acceptors  <cit> . in particular, baraquet et al. showed that the anaerobic respiratory systems are necessary for chemotaxis towards anaerobic electron acceptors  <cit> . in addition, chea- <dig> gene was demonstrated to be essential for the chemotactic behavior in mr- <dig>  <cit> . putting together, our results suggest a mediating role for chea- <dig> in the chemotactic responses to anaerobic electron acceptors. encouraged by this finding, we further conducted a series of la analysis and reported additional results for chea and other genes.

RESULTS
we have conducted a series of la analysis as depicted in figure  <dig>  our findings can be summarized by figure  <dig>  which shows three most significant la-scouting genes chea- <dig>  mgte- <dig> and so <dig>  that affect many pairs of the anaerobic respiration genes. the chemotaxis gene chea- <dig> is already discussed earlier. the second gene mgte- <dig> found in our la analysis encodes a magnesium transporter, suggesting a possible connection between electron transfer and the magnesium transport system in s. oneidensis. this is consistent with a recent study on cobalt reduction wherein the authors found not only the critical involvement of the mtr respiratory proteins  but also pointed out that the process could be influenced by magnesium concentrations  <cit> . furthermore, the ability of electricity production and fe reduction in s. oneidensis is similar to that in the bacterium aeromonas hydrophila  <cit> , of which some mgte mutants showed significantly reduced swarming in semisolid swarming agar  <cit> . chemotaxis is essential for swarming motility in bacteria  <cit> . thus our finding brings out a likely coordinative gene regulation between the chemotaxis pathway, the electron transfer and the magnesium transport system. so <dig> encodes a triheme c-type cytochrome. a deletion mutant of so <dig>  along with mutants of mtra, mtrb, and omcb/omca, was found to be limited in solid fe oxide  reduction relative to the wild type  <cit> . interestingly, our la network also showed that omca, omcb, mtra and mtrb genes are connected to chea- <dig>  mgte- <dig>  and so <dig> 

the leading la-scouting gene chea-1
to study the co-expression pattern between seven arp genes, we took them as genes x and y to explore gpl3253_cia using the la system as shown in block  <dig>  of figure  <dig>  the outputs of a short list of  <dig> genes z with the best la scores from the positive and the negative ends are given in additional file  <dig>  for x = omca, mtra, omcb, or mtrb, y = gspf, the gene z with the highest score la is chea- <dig>  in addition, chea- <dig> also appears in the outputs of , , , and  with significant p values . as one anonymous referee pointed out, genes cyma, mtra, mtrb and omcb were controlled by a global transcriptional regulator crp  <cit> . we conducted la analysis using mtrb, omcb, mtra and crp  as the lead and found chea- <dig> again .

chea-3-arp gene-initiated liquid association search identifies chea-1
in the s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  chea- <dig> gene was necessary for chemotactic behavior  <cit> . it would be interesting to know how chea- <dig> may be associated with the electron transport, as shown in block  <dig>  of figure  <dig>  we take chea- <dig>  omcb, mtra, omca, mtrb and gspf as the lead to explore gpl3253_cia. interestingly, we find the gene chea- <dig> among the leading  <dig> positive la-scouting genes . because chea- <dig> was essential for chemotactic responses to anaerobic electron acceptors  <cit> , this provided additional evidence about the suggested role of chea- <dig> as discussed above.

the leading la-scouting gene mgte-1
moving to block  <dig>  of figure  <dig>  we find mgte- <dig> among the leading  <dig> positive la-scouting genes when taking chea- <dig>  omca, mtra and omcb as the lead . interestingly, as shown in block  <dig> , a positive la-scouting gene mgte- <dig> at the first place is found after taking mtra, mtrb, omca and omcb as x and y . as one referee pointed out, genes mtrb, mtra, omcb and omca are located in a cluster and may be part of the same operon. on the other hand, gspd, gspe  and gspf are in another cluster. interestingly, mgte- <dig> resulted from the la analysis on gene pairs in the first cluster, while chea- <dig> resulted from the la analysis on gene pairs from different clusters.

mgte-1-initiated genome-wide liquid association search identifies coxg
we treat mgte- <dig> as the query gene x and evaluate the la score for every pair of genes  at block  <dig>  of figure  <dig>  we found both genes y = coxg  and z = so <dig>  at the first place on the positive end. moving to block  <dig> , we also found chea- <dig> with the largest positive la score after taking coxg, mtra, mtrb, omca and omcb as x and y. within the interior of cell aggregates, aggregate formation may establish the ecological conditions to enhance anaerobic metabolism  <cit> . under aerobic-aggregated conditions, coxg, haem c biosynthesis genes , anaerobic electron transfer genes  and na-translocating nadh-quinone reductase genes  were all upregulated  <cit> . from the analysis performed at block  <dig>  of figure  <dig>  the gene with the largest positive la score turns out to be so <dig> after taking genes  involved in anaerobic respiration as x, y. our result provided new insights on the regulation of the genes  that may influence the ability to respire anaerobically in aerobic environments.

nitrous oxide  study using liquid association
nitrate reductase  reduces nitrate  to nitrite . after that, nitrite respiration may proceeds in two different ways  <cit> . in respiratory denitrification, nitrite is reduced sequentially to nitric oxide , nitrous oxide , and dinitrogen  involving nitrous oxide reductase . alternatively, nitrite can also be reduced to ammonium  by the nitrite reductase  and cruz-garcía et al. showed that anaerobic cultures of mr- <dig> grown with nitrate displayed sequential reduction of nitrate to nitrite and then to ammonium  <cit> . however, the authors also reported the unexpected detection of nitrous oxide and dinitrogen at the same time. the mr- <dig> genome includes five nos genes: nosa, nosl, nosd, nosf and nosy. from the analysis performed at block  <dig>  of figure  <dig>  we can find chea- <dig> and so <dig> among the leading  <dig> positive la-scouting genes after taking nosf, nosd and napa as x and y to explore gpl3253_cia . the results suggested that little nitrous oxide and dinitrogen detected in cruz-garcía et al.'s experiment might be produced by the complex regulatory mechanism between nos genes, napa, so <dig> and chea- <dig>  mr- <dig> chemotaxis to nitrate and nitrite was reported in the literature  <cit> . this further supports the scenario of napa, chea- <dig> and so <dig> involvement in affecting n2o emission by s. oneidensis mr- <dig>

as suggested by one referee, we used computer to select one thousand pairs of genes randomly from the pool of anaerobic respiration-irrelevant genes  and conduct the la analysis to find out how likely chea- <dig> and so <dig> will appear as the leading mediator gene by chance. it turns out that chea- <dig> was detected only  <dig> times and so <dig> was detected  <dig> times. thus statistically, the chance is only  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively that our findings might be an artifact.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
all la plots are easy to create online using our la system. figure  <dig> shows the coexpression pattern change between omca and gspf as mediated by gene chea- <dig>  when the expression level of chea- <dig> is high , a strong positive correlation is seen between omca and gspf . when chea- <dig> is low , the association is much decreased . a similar interpretation can be given to the la activity for , , and  with chea- <dig> being the positive scouting gene .




we examined the experimental conditions associated with the differential coexpression pattern found by la more closely. in figure  <dig>  the low expression of chea- <dig>  occurred on the conditions when mr- <dig> was incubated after a temperature downshift from 30°c to 8°c over a period of 40- <dig> min and the conditions at 30°c over a period of  <dig> min after the ionizing radiation  exposure . in contrast, the high expression of chea- <dig>  tended to occur earlier in response to environmental stress: over a period of 5- <dig> min after the downshift of temperature, and over a period of  <dig> min after ir exposure. putting together, our result showed that the up-regulation of the positive la-scouting gene chea- <dig> enhanced the co-expression strength of omca, mtra, omcb, mtrb and gspf, thereby increasing the entire electron-flow efficiency. this early response of gene regulation may be an important factor for the survival of mr- <dig> under environmental stress.

furthermore, in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  chea- <dig> gene was essential for chemotactic responses to anaerobic electron acceptors  <cit> . the la search initiated by pairing chea- <dig> with arp genes identifies chea- <dig> . in addition, baraquet et al. showed that at least one major  and four minor  methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins are involved in energy taxis. we also found chea- <dig> among the leading  <dig> positive la-scouting genes when taking arp genes and so <dig>  so <dig>  and so <dig> as the lead . our bioinformatic results suggest that che and several arp genes  are important for the proper functioning of the mechanisms underlying electron acceptor chemotaxis. based on the assistance of la analysis, investigators may design experiments to demonstrate that chea- <dig> may play a role in optimizing chemotactic behavior. for instance, researchers might study the chea- <dig> mutant of mr- <dig> under ir exposure  and/or cold shock  because our microarray data were extracted from two series gse <dig>  and gse <dig> .

the slow biotransformation rate of substrates to electrons has been a bottleneck in mfc performance  <cit> . applying la system, we are able to find previously unknown relationship between chemotaxis and electron transfer. thus our study has the potential of helping researchers to break the internal metabolic limitation of the microbes for the mfc efficiency improvement. it is also noteworthy that there are several statistical methods that may extend the la system for more complex interaction analysis  <cit> .
