BACKGROUND
centromeres are chromosomal regions that control chromosome segregation during cell division in eukaryotes, through kinetochore assembly and microtubule attachment. in almost all eukaryotes, the dna underlying centromeres is made of large tracts of nearly identical tandem dna repeats, known as satellite dna . the remarkable variation of satellite dnas between species has been an enigma ever since their discovery and different important roles have been ascribed to these sequences, from the imperative centromeric function in mitosis and meiosis to regulatory functions  <cit> .

alpha satellite dna is the most abundant satellite dna in primates and is found both at the site of centromere attachment and in neighboring heterochromatic regions, referred to as pericentromeric regions  <cit> . alpha satellite dna was originally isolated as a highly repetitive component of the chlorocebus aethiops  genome  <cit> ; homologous repeats were then described throughout the primate order including apes, old world and new world monkeys . alpha satellite dna is made of tandemly repeated at-rich monomers that are about 170 bp in length and organized in head-to-tail orientation  <cit> . in the human genome, individual monomers share between  <dig> and 100% sequence identity. the highly identical composition of successive repeats represents a technical challenge that has thwarted the complete assembly of centromeric dna so far  <cit> . nevertheless, over the last 30 years, the systematic cloning and sequencing of many alpha satellite dnas, combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization  experiments, has provided a thorough knowledge of alpha satellite dna diversity and organization patterns in the human genome  <cit>  and, to a much lesser extent, in other primates .

in human, alpha satellite dna has been shown to adopt two different organizations. in the so-called higher order repeat  organizational pattern, highly conserved repeat units , each made of multiple 171 bp monomers , are found as an homogenized array that can extend over a multimegabase-sized region . this organization is typically found as very long arrays of alpha satellites at the centromere core of all human chromosomes. in pericentromeres, a second type of organization, called monomeric and involving arrays of single alpha satellite monomers which are less well conserved , can coexist with hors  <cit> . sequence comparisons between human alpha satellite monomers have led to the description of up to seventeen different alpha satellite families, or monomer types  <cit> . although the alpha satellite component of other primate genomes has been less intensively studied, there is some evidence for similar organizations in great apes, but additional families have been described and the composition of hors as well as their chromosomal distribution differ when compared with human . this implies that the structure and content of centromeric dna can change in a few million years.

although the mechanisms that gave rise to this diversity and organization are not precisely known, it is commonly accepted that the so-called concerted evolution of repetitive sequences is based on different mechanisms of non-reciprocal transfer occurring within or between chromosomes, such as unequal crossover, gene conversion, rolling circle replication and reinsertion, and transposon-mediated exchange  <cit> . such mechanisms enable series of amplification events, thereby creating new arrays of alpha satellites . the analysis of the different alpha satellite families found in assembled pericentromeric regions from specific human chromosomes revealed an age gradient of the families along each chromosome arm, which led to propose that during the course of evolution, new arrays of alpha satellites expand at the centromere core, thereby splitting and displacing older arrays distally onto each arm  <cit> .

knowledge about alpha satellite dna in species outside the hominoid group is very scarce, in particular in old world monkeys, a clade that includes colobinae, papionini and cercopithecini. the tribe cercopithecini contains  <dig> species which have diversified within the last  <dig> million years  <cit>  and therefore represents a particularly interesting group for studying the evolution of satellite dna. moreover, it has been reported that alpha satellite dna is more abundant in some cercopithecini species   <cit>  than in great apes, where its contribution would reach only 3% of the genome  <cit> . finally, enzymatic digestion of genomic dna from various old world monkey species can lead to a clear alpha satellite ladder pattern which is not observed when human or chimpanzee dna is used, thereby pointing to different composition and organization of alpha satellite dna in old world monkeys  <cit> .

in the present work, we have undertaken the targeted sequencing of the alpha satellite component of cercopithecus solatus  as a representative species for the cercopithecini  <cit> . alpha satellite monomers and dimers were obtained by enzymatic digestion of genomic dna and gel purification, then submitted to high-throughput sequencing. the obtained sequences were analyzed and classified into monomer families using computational approaches. finally the genomic distribution of each family was studied by fish using a collection of oligonucleotide probes that are able to distinguish different sequence variants. our study provides evidence for the existence of two main families of monomers which differ in their chromosomal distribution, one being specifically distributed on centromeres while the other is found only at pericentromeric locations with a non-uniform distribution between chromosomes. two other families are detected which are only found associated within a dimeric organization and are located for the greatest part on the y chromosome and to a lesser extent on pericentromeres from other chromosomes. these data represent the most complete analysis of the diversity and distribution of alpha satellite sequences in an old world monkey reported to date. our experimental approach may be applied to other species, opening new perspectives regarding the integration of satellite dna into comparative studies.

RESULTS
retrieval of alpha satellite sequences from the cercopithecus solatus genome
work conducted in the early 1980s had shown that enzymatic digestion of genomic dna from old world monkeys with several restriction enzymes resulted in a migration profile that was characteristic for alpha satellite dna, i.e. with bands corresponding to one and multiple repeat units of about n x 170 bp in length  <cit> . in silico analysis of several sequences isolated from chlorocebus aethiops led us to select the xmni restriction endonuclease as a candidate that should cleave a majority of monomers. experimental digestion of cercopithecus solatus genomic dna with this enzyme revealed the expected banding pattern . we therefore decided to extract dna from two bands corresponding to monomers and dimers of alpha satellites from an agarose gel and implemented high throughput sequencing on an ion torrent sequencing platform providing reads up to  <dig> nucleotide in length .

 <dig>  and  <dig>  raw sequences were obtained for the monomer and dimer samples, respectively. four in silico filters were applied successively to both datasets: a quality filter keeping sequences with a phred quality score superior to 25; an extremity filter keeping sequences with the xmni restriction site at both ends; a length filter keeping sequences within the range 162–182 bp for monomers and 324–364 bp for dimers, and an alpha satellite filter keeping sequences similar to an alpha satellite reference sequence . the number of sequences that remained after each filter is reported on additional file 2: table s <dig>  a total of  <dig>  sequences fitting with all the criteria was obtained from the monomer sample and represents what we call from now on the monomer dataset. for the dimer sample, only  <dig>  were obtained, they represent the dimer dataset. the drastic reduction observed within the dimer dataset was mostly the consequence of the length filter and may reflect an intrinsic limitation of the sequencing technology, unable to obtain long reads when template sequences are made of two successive highly identical sequences. these sequences were nevertheless included for further analysis as they provided an additional source of information .

characterization of alpha satellite diversity in the monomer dataset
a principal component analysis  using the 5-mer nucleotide composition of dna sequences was applied to the monomer dataset in order to compare these sequences and identify putative groups without direct alignment. visualization of sequences into the plane formed by the two first components of the pca revealed two main groups of alpha satellite monomers, as shown by the distribution of points on fig. 1a. monomers were classified into each group by using a hierarchical clustering analysis  based on a subset of sequences followed by a linear discriminant analysis  to extend the classification to all the sequences . the most important group, called c <dig> and shown in purple, contained 82% of the sequences and the other group, called c <dig> and shown in pastel green, contained the remaining 18%. to address the quality of this classification,  <dig> sequences were then randomly selected within the complete monomer dataset and were used to generate a phylogenetic tree where branches were colored according to the monomer classification . the disposition of sequences from the c <dig> and c <dig> groups on this tree provided a further support to our classification into two groups. moreover, this tree showed a higher degree of divergence between c <dig> sequences compared to c <dig> sequences. actually, the comparison of a subset of  <dig> randomly selected sequences within each group showed that the average sequence identity inside c <dig> was 95%, whereas the average sequence identity inside c <dig> was only 85%. the consensus sequences of c <dig> and c <dig> were 172 bp in length, and differed from each other by a total of  <dig> positions . finally, monomers were searched for the presence of cenp-b and pjalpha boxes  <cit> . a pjalpha box was present in the consensus of c <dig> and c <dig> and was found in 95% of c <dig> sequences and 85% of c <dig> sequences, whereas a cenp-b box was only found in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these sequences, respectively.fig.  <dig> characterization of alpha satellite dna diversity in the monomer dataset. a pca projection on principal components  <dig> and  <dig> of the normalized 5-mer frequency vectors for all sequences. each point represents a sequence and has been colored according to its assignment to the c <dig>  or c <dig>  alpha satellite family based on hierarchical classification method. b phylogenetic tree  for  <dig> randomly selected sequences. the color code matches the one described for  and . bootstrap values for the branches leading to c <dig> and c <dig> are not indicated as they remain below 50%

in order to further characterize the sequence diversity within the monomer dataset, we searched for the presence of identical sequences and noticed that while the sequences within the c <dig> group were all unique, numerous identical sequences could be found within the c <dig> group. a total of  <dig>  sequences were repeated at least twice, representing a total of  <dig>  reads in our dataset. among those sequences,  <dig> were repeated more than  <dig> times and one  <dig>  times. we decided to investigate further the  <dig> most abundant sequences. the most abundant sequence was exactly the consensus sequence of the c <dig> group, while all the others corresponded to this sequence with single nucleotide variations and/or deletions, as indicated on table  <dig>  the absence of repeated sequences in the c <dig> group let us hypothesize, by contrast, that the different repeats observed in the c <dig> group may directly reflect the presence of strictly identical sequences in the cercopithecus solatus genome. as ion torrent sequencing has been reported to give rise to sequencing errors, we decided to search if the identical sequences were obtained from reads collected in both orientations. we found that five out of the  <dig> sequences were associated with a strong bias for read orientation . within these five sequences, the three more abundant  represented deletions within a homopolymer tract, while the two others  corresponded to the combination of the two most abundant deletions  with the most abundant single nucleotide variation . deletions within homopolymer tracts have already been shown to be inherent to the ion torrent technology  <cit>  and the orientation bias we observed let us conclude that sequences displaying these deletions were non-relevant artifacts. on the contrary, all other sequences observed in high copy number, which were all obtained in both sequencing orientations, would correspond to sequence variants that are present with a high abundance in the cercopithecus solatus genome.table  <dig> analysis of alpha satellite sequences found in high copy number in the monomer dataset

characterization of alpha satellite diversity in the dimer dataset
among the  <dig>  sequences recovered from the dimer dataset,  <dig>  contained an intact xmni restriction site approximately located in the middle, suggesting that the enzymatic digestion was not complete. the remaining  <dig>  sequences, which did not possess the xmni restriction site, were split using an alignment-based process  and the resulting monomers were submitted to a length filter, giving a total of  <dig>  associated left and right monomers. we focused first on these sequences and submitted them to the same process as described above. pca showed the existence of two groups for both the left and right monomers, which could be discriminated using hca . a comparison of the consensus sequences of each group revealed that the most abundant sequence set for both the left and right monomers belonged to the c <dig> group, while the two smaller sequence sets had consensus sequences that differed from each other and from the consensus of the c <dig> and c <dig> groups . these two new groups of sequences, which represented 5% of the left or right monomers, will be from now on called c <dig> and c <dig> and shown in dark and light pink, respectively. we decided to build a phylogenetic tree with left and right monomers mixed together, using the described color code . this tree confirmed the existence of c <dig> and c <dig> as separate groups. their respective average sequence identities were measured to be 86% and 83%. we also checked that left and right monomers belonging to the c <dig> group could not be distinguished from each other on a phylogenetic tree , or from the c <dig> sequences present in the monomer dataset. the comparison of the consensus sequences showed that the c <dig> and c <dig> groups differed much more from each other and from the c <dig> and c <dig> groups than c <dig> and c <dig> differed from each other. interestingly, c <dig> was the only group with a consensus length of 171 bp instead of 172 bp. a search for cenp-b and pjalpha boxes showed that most sequences within the c <dig> group contained a pjalpha box  while the cenp-b box was absent, like observed for the c <dig> and c <dig> groups. by contrast, neither the pjalpha box nor the cenp-b box was found in the sequences from the c <dig> group .fig.  <dig> characterization of alpha satellite diversity in the dimer dataset. pca projection of the normalized 5-mer frequency vectors are shown for  the left monomers and  the right monomers. each point represents a sequence and has been colored according to its assignment to the c <dig> , c <dig>  or c <dig>  alpha satellite family based on hierarchical classification method. c phylogenetic tree  for  <dig> randomly selected left monomers and  <dig> randomly selected right monomers. the color code matches the one described for  and . bootstrap values for the branches leading to c <dig> and c <dig> are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively




the dimer dataset was also used to infer information regarding how monomers belonging to different groups associated with each other. all left and right monomers were assigned to one of the c <dig> to c <dig> groups . additional file 2: table s <dig> reports the results of these assignments as well as associations between left and right monomers, distinguishing dimers that contained the xmni site  and those where the xmni site was absent . we noticed that sequences from the c <dig> group were absent from the nox dataset and were poorly represented in the x dataset. this result may appear unexpected as 82% of the sequences from the monomer dataset belonged to the c <dig> group. two hypotheses may explain this observation: the high sequence identity within the c <dig> group may reduce both the likelihood of the inactivation of the xmni digestion site through mutations and the sequencing efficiency of dimers . a statistical analysis of the x dataset showed that left monomers from the c <dig> and c <dig> groups were preferentially associated to right monomers from the same group , which suggests that sequences from the c <dig> and the c <dig> groups are tandemly repeated in the cercopithecus solatus genome. c2-c <dig> associations were also found to predominate within the nox dataset. interestingly, left monomers from the c <dig> group were preferentially associated to right monomers from the c <dig> group, suggesting the existence of a higher order organization with repeats containing at least two monomers belonging to different groups.

genomic distribution of alpha satellite families on cercopithecus solatus chromosomes
we were next interested in studying the genomic distribution of the four groups of sequences identified above. short oligonucleotide probes have been shown to be more efficient at distinguishing alpha satellite sequences that differ by very few nucleotides compared with classical probes obtained by random priming or nick translation  <cit> . we chose to use synthetic 18-mer oligonucleotides carrying locked nucleic acid  modifications at one out of two positions and capable of forming at least  <dig> gc base pairs, as previous work had demonstrated their interest for the detection of alpha satellite sequences  <cit> . an in silico probe selection process was implemented in order to identify among the most common 18-mer sequences within a group  those that were specific for this group . as we expected that oligonucleotide probes may still hybridize in the presence of one mismatch, we calculated the expected binding frequencies when one mismatch was present and applied the same selection criteria once again. additional file 1: figure s <dig> reports the sequences that best fitted with our requirements, albeit not completely. due to the high sequence similarity between sequences within the c <dig> and c <dig> groups, probes had to distinguish sequences that differ mainly by only two nucleotides or even a single one . the two sets of probes selected to target the c <dig> and c <dig> groups were therefore designed so that they would compete with each other if used simultaneously. the detection systems  were chosen in order to allow various combinations of probes to be tested together.

a first series of fish experiments on cercopithecus solatus metaphase spreads was performed using probes c1a and c2a or c1b and c2b simultaneously. probes targeting the c <dig> group produced intense signals at the centromere  of all chromosomes except a single one , while probes targeting the c <dig> group provided signals that are located in the pericentromeric regions  of several chromosomes pairs with different labeling patterns . some chromosomes were extensively labeled by c <dig> probes on both sides of the centromere, others seem to be labeled at only one side, and others seemed to display no signal . stronger signals were observed on the acrocentric chromosome short arms . when these probes were used alone, each c1a or c2a probe produced a labeling pattern similar to what was observed in the presence of the other. on the contrary, each c1b or c2b probe used alone labeled regions that are larger than in the absence of the other. these experiments suggest that our probes may hybridize to sequences that differ by a single nucleotide  but that this binding is inhibited in the presence of an adequate competitor probe. in addition, when target sequences differ by at least two nucleotides, a specific detection is achieved in the absence of competitor.fig.  <dig> fish analysis of the c <dig> and c <dig> alpha satellite families characterized in the monomer dataset. probes c1b and c2b are hybridized simultaneously to cercopithecus solatus chromosomes, which are colored in blue. a hybridization of probe c1b is shown in red. the arrow points to a single unlabeled chromosome. b hybridization of probe c2b is shown in green. c combined signals from  and .  focus on image  showing in details the different types of distribution of the c2b signals relatively to c1b. 1: c2b labels both pericentromeric regions, 2: c2b labels one pericentromeric region toward the long arm, 3: c2b labels one pericentromeric region toward the short arm of an acrocentric chromosome, 4: no c2b signal can be observed on this chromosome. scale bar = 10 μm




additional experiments showed that in presence of competitors, the signal produced by c1a overlapped with the signal produced by c1b and the signal produced by c2a almost perfectly overlapped with the one produced by c2b . this observation supports the idea that the labeling patterns observed with the chosen oligonucleotide probes reflect the distribution of the sequence groups identified by sequence analysis. moreover, the absence of overlap between signals provided by probes targeting sequences from the c <dig> and c <dig> groups suggests that monomers within each group are clustered together and do not mix with each other. combined with the arguments described above that are in favor of a tandem organization of monomers for both the c <dig> and c <dig> groups, these features support the fact that the c <dig> and c <dig> groups of sequences represent distinct families of alpha satellite dna that display a monomeric organization in the genome of cercopithecus solatus.

further experiments were performed with probes targeting the c <dig> and c <dig> groups. all c <dig> and c <dig> probes provided identical labeling patterns, with a strong signal located on a single chromosome, as well as very weak pericentromeric signals on some other chromosomes . the chromosome labeled by the c <dig> and c <dig> probes, which is in fact the chromosome that was not labeled by the probes targeting c <dig>  was also identified to be the y chromosome by cytogenetic experiments . the colocalization of probes targeting the c <dig> and c <dig> groups and the absence of overlap with probes targeting the c <dig> or c <dig> group is consistent with the sequence analysis described above. these results taken together suggest thus that sequences belonging to the c <dig> and c <dig> groups represent additional families of alpha satellite dna that display a higher order organization within the genome of cercopithecus solatus. as a further control of the consistency between the results from fish experiments and sequence analysis, we showed that a 13-mer lna probe that was designed to target the four c <dig> to c <dig> groups of sequences  provided signals that overlapped with the combined signals of probes targeting each group, i.e. was able to label all chromosomes within the centromeric and pericentromeric regions .fig.  <dig> fish analysis of the c <dig> and c <dig> alpha satellite families characterized in the dimer dataset. probes c1a, c3a and c4a are hybridized simultaneously to cercopithecus solatus chromosomes, which are colored in blue. a hybridization of probe c1a is shown in red. a single chromosome  is not labeled. b hybridization of probe c3a is shown in green. c hybridization of probe c4a is shown in red. the pericentromeric regions of several chromosomes are sparingly labeled by c3a and c4a. scale bar = 10 μm




we were also interested in studying the chromosomal distribution of some of the repeated sequences found in high copy number in the monomer dataset. the results of our previously described fish experiments suggest that the specific detection of single nucleotide variations may be difficult to achieve using individual probes but that using several probes in competition may provide the possibility to achieve the required level of specificity. therefore, we designed new oligonucleotide probes targeting a common region, aiming at distinguishing three different highly repeated sequences with single nucleotide variations . when all probes were used in combination, probes targeting sequence  <dig>  and sequence  <dig>  seemed to label all chromosomes, albeit with non-overlapping patterns , while probe targeting sequence  <dig>  was clearly shown to produce a signal on only  <dig> chromosomes.fig.  <dig> fish analysis of the chromosomal distribution of three sequences found in high copy number. probes t39g, a40c and c42g and the competitor oligonucleotide tacco  are hybridized simultaneously to cercopithecus solatus chromosomes, which are colored in blue. a hybridization of probe t39g is shown in green. b hybridization of probe a40c is shown in red. eight chromosomes are labeled. c hybridization of probe c42g is shown in green. d combined signals from  and . e combined signals from  and . f combined signals from  and  with probe t39g shown in green and probe c42g shown in red. upper inset in ,  and  shows one chromosome where signals from the  <dig> probes do not overlap. lower inset in  shows two chromosomes, one being labeled by probe t39g and the other by probe a40c. scale bar = 10 μm




comparison of cercopithecus solatus alpha satellite families with known primate families
the sequence families defined above may provide information regarding the evolutionary history of alpha satellite dna in primates. we were therefore interested in investigating phylogenetic relationships between these families and alpha satellite sequences that were previously described for other primate species. interestingly, the first alpha satellite consensus sequence ever described, which was obtained for the cercopithecini chlorocebus aethiops  <cit> , was exactly the same as the consensus sequence of our c <dig> family, which is also the most abundant repeated sequence in our dataset. this identity suggests the conservation of the c <dig> family between cercopithecini species. although very few sequences were available, a tentative classification was previously proposed for alpha satellite dna present in old and new world monkeys, involving five families termed s <dig> to s <dig>  <cit> . we built a phylogenetic tree containing  <dig> sequences randomly selected within each of our c <dig> to c <dig> families and several sequences representative for s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> . the s <dig> sequences obtained from chlorocebus aethiops were intermingled in this tree with our c <dig> and c <dig> sequences. other sequences classified in s <dig> but obtained from other species were dispersed in other parts of the graph, suggesting that the proposed s <dig> family was not relevant. there was also no clear proximity of each one of the c <dig> to c <dig> family with sequences belonging to the so-called s <dig>  s <dig> or s <dig> family. the phylogenetic tree showed on the contrary that sequences from macaque  may form a sister group of the c <dig> family whereas the only available baboon sequence  was close to the c <dig> family. none of the sequences from macaque or baboon resembled those from our c <dig> or c <dig> family. all these results suggest that, contrary to s <dig> and s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> do not correspond to alpha satellite families. we also built a phylogenetic tree involving our c1-c <dig> families and seven families  that were previously identified in human pericentromeric regions, some of them being reported as similar to sequences found in other primates  <cit>  . the tree suggests that alpha satellite families found in cercopithecus solatus have an evolutionary history that is largely independent from that of the alpha satellite families found in human pericentromeric regions.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships between cercopithecus solatus alpha satellite families and other previously identified primate families. a phylogenetic tree  for  <dig> randomly selected sequences within each c <dig> to c <dig> family and  <dig> monomers  used in  <cit>  to propose the s1-s <dig> families in old and new world monkeys : one s <dig> monomer from baboon , two s <dig> monomers from macaque , five s <dig> monomers from macaque , six s <dig> monomers from chlorocebus aethiops , six s <dig> monomers  and two s <dig> monomers  from new world monkeys. c <dig> is shown in purple, c <dig> in pastel green, c <dig> in dark pink and c <dig> in light pink. bootstrap values are given for principal branches when superior to  <dig>  b phylogenetic tree  for  <dig> randomly selected sequences within each c <dig> to c <dig> family and within pericentromeric human families: r1- <dig> , m <dig> , v <dig> , h1- <dig> , h <dig>  and h <dig> . c <dig> is shown in purple, c <dig> in pastel green, c <dig> in dark pink and c <dig> in light pink. bootstrap values are given for cercopithecus solatus principal branches




discussion
despite the recent generalization of high-throughput sequencing, application of these new technologies to the study of repeated dna remains scarce  <cit> . here, we present an original experimental and computational framework for studying repeated dna. we have focused on a single cercopithecini species where the diversity and organization of alpha satellite dna are described in details. our approach relies on sequencing of gel purified alpha satellite monomers and dimers obtained by restriction enzyme digestion of genomic dna, followed by sequence analysis and fish experiments with carefully designed probes.

we detected four alpha satellite families, called c <dig> to c <dig>  in the cercopithecus solatus genome. additional families may have been missed by our approach, for example because they would not contain restriction sites for xmni. although some technical issue had drastically reduced the number of available amount of sequences containing two monomers, the dimer dataset provided information about the structural organization of each family, showing that the c <dig> and c <dig> families adopt a monomeric organization, while c <dig> and c <dig> would associate into hors. our data do not allow concluding if the c3-c <dig> dimers are tandemly repeated or represent only a part of a longer hor involving other monomers, but suggest that such structures, which have also been observed in new world monkey genomes  <cit> , may be widespread in primates. it had previously been reported, using a limited number of sequences, that alpha satellite sequences in old world monkeys contained a pjalpha binding site and no cenp-b binding site  <cit> . our data provide further support to this observation which holds true for three of the four newly identified families. the absence of any of these two binding sites in the c <dig> family represents an oddity but one should notice that as sequences from the c <dig> family are associated with sequences from the c <dig> family into a hor organization, the pjalpha binding site remains present in the repeated motif. we detected several sequences in our dataset that were repeated identically a high number of times . as our protocol does not contain any pcr amplification before capture of individual sequences on beads, the abundance of these sequences may reflect their natural abundance within the cercopithecus solatus genome, provided one is able to identify potential artifacts resulting from sequencing errors among those sequences.

the high similarity between cercopithecus solatus alpha satellite families, especially c <dig> and c <dig>  the consensus of which differ at only a few nucleotide positions, required the implementation of a highly specific fish detection to infer their chromosomal distribution. our results emphasize the interest of short lna-modified oligonucleotide probes that are here shown to be able to distinguish sequences that differ by only two nucleotides. it is even possible to distinguish a single nucleotide variation between two sequences by using two probes targeting each sequence variant simultaneously. in all our experiments, we cannot exclude the possibility that probes also hybridize to sequences that are not perfectly complementary, nor that some signals do not come from sequences that are present in the cercopithecus solatus genome but not found in our datasets. nevertheless, the absence of cross labeling between the probes targeting different families and the consistency of hybridization results with predictions inferred from sequence analysis support our probe design strategy and stands for the accuracy and the exhaustiveness of our description of the alpha satellite component of cercopithecus solatus.

our fish experiments showed that the c <dig> family, which is the most conserved , displays a centromeric localization while the more divergent c <dig> family  displays a pericentromeric localization. according to the age-gradient based model for centromere evolution  <cit> , we may speculate that this pattern results from a peculiar evolutionary history where the c <dig> family, an old family of sequences, had occupied a centromeric position in an ancestor of cercopithecus solatus. this family would then have been displaced towards pericentromeric regions following the amplification of more recent sequences from the c <dig> family at the centromere. unequal crossing over at nearly identical repeats is thought indeed to lead to the homogenization of the core centromere, while mutations would only affect repeats outside of the core centromere . an alternative but non-exclusive hypothesis would attribute distinct functional roles to both families, for example centromere function to c <dig> and cohesion of sister chromatids to c <dig>  as it has been proposed for mouse minor and major satellite sequences, respectively  <cit> . interestingly, acrocentric chromosome short arms display a very large amount of c <dig> sequences as revealed by intense fish signals. this observation provides support to a previous hypothesis according to which acrocentric chromosomes may physically interact and exchange genetic material  <cit> . the fact that the c3-c <dig> dimers are found on the y chromosome and are almost absent from other chromosomes may be explained by the fact that the y chromosome is excluded from recombination events with non-homologous chromosomes, as was observed in mice  <cit> . finally, the observation of the distribution of one of the highly repeated sequence variants on only  <dig> chromosomes supports the existence of local alpha satellite homogenization events in the cercopithecus solatus genome.

previous studies had considered alpha satellite dna in cercopithecini as poorly diversified  <cit> . our results show that at least four alpha satellite families can be present in a single species, with complex chromosomal distribution and organizational patterns. comparative studies including repetitive dnas from different species have already been shown to provide new insights into genome and species evolution  <cit> . our approach will permit not only to investigate the taxonomic distribution of alpha satellite families but also to study their organizational pattern, their chromosomal distribution as well as the existence of conserved highly repeated sequence variants. phylogenetic analysis have demonstrated that the c <dig> to c <dig> families represent newly identified entities that do not correspond to previously proposed alpha satellite families. although the available data are in favor of an apparent conservation of both the c <dig> and c <dig> families between cercopithecus solatus and chlorocebus aethiops, further studies will be required to better understand the dynamics of alpha satellite dna in old world monkeys and in other primates.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have presented here a generally applicable strategy that provides, for a single species, a comprehensive description of alpha satellite sequence diversity and organization. our approach, which is easy to implement and cost-effective, provides an opportunity to characterize satellite dna in all species where a characteristic enzymatic ladder pattern can be obtained. comparing different individuals and different species will provide new insights into the dynamics at which new satellite families or new highly repeated sequence variants appear during the course of evolution and transfer between chromosomes. the better description of the structure of heterochromatic regions also provides potential for enhancing the epigenetic characterization of these regions as well as understanding the regulatory functions of heterochromatin.
