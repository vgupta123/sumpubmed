BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  in humans and animals may result from exposure to bacilli within the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex such as m. tb, m. bovis, m. africanum, m. microti, m. caprae, m. orygis, m. suricattae, m. mungi, or m. canetti  <cit> . m. bovis is the species most often isolated from tuberculous cattle. despite intensive and costly control efforts over many decades, bovine tb persists in most countries adversely affecting animal health, welfare, and trade as well as the livelihoods of producers. persistence of bovine tb in livestock populations also demands the maintenance of costly federal and regional regulatory networks. control strategies rely largely on ante-mortem testing and slaughter inspection to identify livestock herds at risk. with cattle, the principal ante-mortem tests for presumptive diagnosis of bovine tb are immunoassays that detect cell-mediated responses, including both in vivo  and in vitro  methods . in many countries, tst is applied as the primary test and igra may be used as an ancillary test in cattle to maximize the number of infected animals identified or as a confirmatory test  <cit> . the most common applications for ante-mortem testing include routine surveillance to identify m. bovis-infected herds, test and removal schemes, movement tests, epidemiologic trace-back testing, and in tb-affected herds to delineate animals going to a slaughter plant versus being condemned for rendering. while used extensively for over 100 years in cattle, the tst does have a number of severe shortcomings. the sensitivity of tst ranges broadly from  <dig> to 97% depending on the type and technical variations of test applied, quality of purified protein derivative , environmental exposure/burden to atypical mycobacteria, and many other factors  <cit> . thus, improved ante-mortem tests and/or testing strategies for bovine tb are greatly needed.

over the past decade, a new generation of serologic tests designed to detect antibodies to multiple m. bovis specific antigens have emerged for application in cattle . of these, an elisa using mpb <dig> and mpb <dig> antigens  is approved by the office international des epizooties and us department of agriculture for discretionary use in cattle; however, application of this test has been limited primarily to confirmation of infection. injection of ppds for tst significantly boosts antibody responses in m. bovis infected cattle, including animals without prior detectable antibody responses . the enhanced igg responses are elicited by m. bovis specific antigens  and characterized by accelerated antibody affinity maturation  <cit> . the boosted antibody responses wane beginning ~1-2 months after ppd administration; however, they can be further increased upon ppd re-injection  <cit> . despite these advances, existing antibody assays generally lack diagnostic sensitivity, especially in early infection, and thus require further improvements .

in the present study, sera from m. bovis-infected cattle identified as tst non-reactors in naturally-exposed herds within the us  and gb  were evaluated for antibody responses to m. bovis specific proteins using a next generation immunochromatographic test based on dual-path platform  technology developed by chembio diagnostic systems, inc.   <cit> . findings demonstrate the potential for use of antibody assays to detect m. bovis infection in tst non-reactive cattle within tb-affected herds.

sera  from gb were obtained from m. bovis-infected cattle detected during routine surveillance, including multiple herds and animals of diverse age, gender, breed, and management systems. all animals received a single intradermal comparative cervical test  and of these,  <dig> animals were sicct negative, igra positive  with tuberculous lesions detected postmortem. the other  <dig> animals were sicct positive and not tested by igra  with tuberculous lesions upon postmortem and m. bovis isolated from lesions. serum samples were also collected from  <dig> sicct negative, igra negative cattle located in a tb-free region of gb.

texas, us
a cow with tuberculous lesions  was detected upon routine inspection at an abattoir in  <dig>  the source herd of this cow was determined to consist of approximately  <dig>  holstein dairy cattle. on postmortem examination of initial caudal-fold tuberculin test  reactors, a tuberculous lesion rate  of  <dig> % was found. based on epidemiologic risk factors, it was determined by regulatory officials and dairy management that destocking the dairy would be the best approach to rid it of m. bovis. a cft and collection of blood for serological testing was completed 10-15 days prior to postmortem examination at destocking. a 2% overall prevalence of tb  was noted in cattle among cft positive  and cft negative cattle . from the cft false-negative cattle,  <dig> serum samples obtained within 3 weeks after ppd injection were available for serologic analysis.

michigan, us
two cattle herds, one beef and the other dairy , within the tb-endemic region of michigan  were identified as tb-affected via routine surveillance in  <dig>  animals within these two herds had received cfts yearly for tb surveillance prior to  <dig>  upon identification of tuberculous animals in  <dig>  cfts were applied more frequently  in both herds. based on the presence of gross lesions upon depopulation, prevalence of tb was estimated to be ~21%  and 9%  for the beef and dairy herds, respectively. four serum samples collected from m. bovis-infected cft non-reactors within 3 weeks after the last cft administration were available for serologic testing.

multi-antigen print immunoassay 
mapia was performed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, a panel of ten m. tuberculosis-complex antigens immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane included esat- <dig> , cfp <dig> , mpb <dig> , mpb <dig> , mpb <dig> , cfp10/ esat- <dig> fusion protein, mpb70/mpb <dig> fusion protein, mpb70/cfp10/rv <dig> fusion protein, bovine ppd , and m. bovis culture filtrate . strips were cut and blocked with 1% nonfat milk in pbs with  <dig> % tween  <dig> for 1 h prior to incubation with serum samples diluted 1: <dig> in blocking solution for 1 h. after washing, strips were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated protein g  diluted 1: <dig> for 1 h, washed, and developed with  <dig> ′, <dig> ′-tetramethyl benzidine  .

dual-path platform  assay
bovine igg and igm antibodies to cfp10/esat- <dig> and mpb70/mpb <dig> protein fusions were detected as described previously  <cit>  using goat anti-bovine igg and anti-bovine igm antibodies  conjugated to colloidal gold nanoparticles by chembio standard procedure. sera were diluted 1: <dig> in sample buffer for testing by dpp assay and results were recorded at 15 min using an optical reader to measure test band reflectance in relative light units , as previously described  <cit> . using pre-established cut-off values of  <dig> rlu for cfp10/esat- <dig> antigen and  <dig> rlu for mpb70/mpb <dig> antigen , dpp assay readouts were expressed as signal-to-cutoff ratios, with any values ≥ <dig>  being interpreted as a reactive result and any value < <dig>  being considered as a non-reactive result.

data analysis
diagnostic performance of the serologic assays was assessed against the gold standard of m. bovis culture and/or is- <dig> pcr by calculating test sensitivity and specificity using available software  <cit>  and presented with the 95% confidence intervals . fisher’s exact test was used for analysis of antigen recognition by bovine antibodies in the present study.

RESULTS
antibody detection in tst non-reactors versus tst reactors: samples from great britain
with sera from m. bovis infected cattle in gb, the overall igg reactivity rates in the dpp assay were similar for sicct reactors  and non-reactors . the dpp assay specificity assessed with sera from  <dig> sicct negative, igra negative cattle from tb non-endemic regions of gb was 96% . of note, the response rate by m. bovis-infected cattle to each fusion antigen differed significantly  based on tst reactivity. the ratio of mpb70/mpb <dig> to cfp10/esat- <dig> reactivity was approximately  <dig> : <dig> for tst reactors versus 1: <dig> for tst non-reactors . in line with the above, only  <dig> of  <dig> tst reactors but  <dig> of  <dig> tst non-reactors produced antibody solely to cfp10/esat- <dig> yet not to mpb70/mpb <dig>  thus, the immunodominance of serologically related mpb <dig> and/or mpb <dig> proteins typically detected in m. bovis infected cattle after ppd administration for sicct was less evident with tst non-reactors, as reactivity rates to cfp10/esat- <dig> and mpb70/mpb <dig> were essentially equivalent, and there were considerably more cfp10/esat- <dig> antibody responders within the tst non-reactor subset. this observation demonstrates the potential value for use of additional antigens to maximize the sensitivity of serologic tests, particularly with tst non-reactors.table  <dig> igg reactivity rates in tuberculin skin test reactors and non-reactors found among m. bovis-infected cattle in gb

antibody detection in tst non-reactors: opportunistic samples from the united states
during  <dig> –  <dig>  two herds from disparate regions of the us were under-going whole herd depopulation due to m. bovis infection within the herds. antemortem testing was used to delineate animals going to a slaughter plant  versus being condemned for rendering . serum samples were available for serologic analysis from  <dig> cft non-reactive adult cows with gross tuberculous lesions from the two herds . infection was confirmed in these animals by histopathology, mycobacterial culture, and/or is- <dig> pcr . each of the animals had received a cft ~6 months prior to the non-reactive cft; of which 4/ <dig>  and 0/ <dig>  were reactive at that earlier time point, thus indicating tst reversion in four of the animals. serum samples collected ~1-3 weeks after the last cft were tested with the dpp assay for the presence of igm and igg antibodies to cfp10/esat- <dig> and mpb70/mpb <dig>  only 4/ <dig> animals had igm to mpb70/mpb <dig>  whereas none produced igm to cfp10/esat- <dig>  in contrast, relatively potent igg responses were elicited by mpb70/mpb <dig> and cfp10/esat- <dig> in 8/ <dig> and 3/ <dig> animals, respectively . igm readouts were generally lower than those obtained for igg, suggesting little added value of igm antibody detection from a serodiagnostic sensitivity perspective. the one exception was with animal # <dig> which had a high igm and a borderline igg signal . development of transient igm responses early in the course of experimental m. bovis infection, as well as shortly after tst administration, has been demonstrated in previous studies using different strains of m. bovis  <cit> . thus, the present findings in the us demonstrated antibody responses to m. bovis antigens in ~82% of tst non-reactive cattle with confirmed tb. the specificity of the dpp assay evaluated on  <dig> samples from tb-free states within the us was  <dig> %  or somewhat higher than that found in gb , although not statistically significant .table  <dig> diagnostic characterization of tst false-negative cattle identified in us herds infected with m. bovis

antigen recognition by igg antibodies in sera from tst non-responders
serum samples from the us cattle were also analyzed by mapia to determine antigen recognition patterns. sera from  <dig> of  <dig> cattle reacted with multiple recombinant antigens of m. bovis . the one animal  which had a negative result in the dpp assay, exhibited igg binding only to mbcf in mapia. animal # <dig>  which was the second dpp non-reactor in this group , displayed in mapia weak reactivity with the two fusion antigens containing mpb <dig>  based on line intensity, the magnitude of antibody responses and antigen recognition profiles varied among the animals. the most reactive antigens included mpb <dig> and mpb <dig> proteins, mpb70/mpb <dig> and mpb70/cfp10/rv <dig> hybrids, as well as bppd and mbcf. for m. bovis-infected tst non-reactors, the role of cfp10/esat- <dig> in eliciting antibody responses was not significant in the us  as compared to the gb set of specimens . overall, the antigen recognition results supported the immunodominance of mpb <dig> and mpb <dig> proteins in m. bovis infection of cattle  <cit> .fig.  <dig> mapia testing of tst non-reactive cattle diagnosed with m. bovis infection in the us. assay was performed as described in methods. antigens printed onto nitrocellulose membrane are shown on the right. results are presented for sera from a negative control ,  <dig> animals from tx, and  <dig> animals from mi. animal id numbers are shown on the bottom . visible bands on the strips indicate the presence of igg to corresponding antigen. intensity of the bands generally correlates with the antibody level




discussion
a major impediment to the control of bovine tb is the relatively poor accuracy of current ante-mortem tests compounded by difficulties in reliably detecting tuberculous lesions and/or the agent in all infected animals upon slaughter surveillance. tst non-reactive cattle are particularly problematic when applying test and remove strategies in tb-affected herds. according to lepper et al.  <cit> , “anergy to tuberculin is defined as the failure of an animal with visible evidence of tuberculosis to show a palpable cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity response to a tuberculin, at the time when the test is read.” such tst non-reactive animals, however, may still be responsive on other cell-mediated  or antibody detection immunoassays  <cit> . in general, tst non-responsiveness is more common in animals from herds with high within-herd prevalence and in animals at advanced stages of disease  <cit> . desensitization as a result of repeated short interval application of tsts may also lead to reduced tst responses associated with increased interleukin- <dig>  and decreased il-1β production to tb antigens  <cit> . our findings further demonstrate that certain m. bovis-infected cattle can escape detection by tst by reverting from reactors to non-reactors within several months; however, a significant proportion of these animals can be identified by ancillary tests, such as the antibody tests described herein or igra  <cit> .

in the present study, m. bovis specific antibody was detected by the dpp assay in ~82% and ~65% of m. bovis-infected, tst non-reactive cattle from the us and gb, respectively. as reported previously, an in-house mpb83-based elisa detected  <dig> of  <dig>  sicct non-reactors diagnosed with bovine tb in gb  <cit> . similarly, the mpb70/ <dig> antibody reactivity rate in the group of tst non-reactive cattle in gb was ~40% as demonstrated by dpp assay  and also shown independently by a commercial elisa  using a cocktail of mpb <dig> and mpb <dig> proteins . importantly, integrating cfp10/esat- <dig> to supplement mpb70/mpb <dig> antigen in the dpp assay enhanced the overall test sensitivity to ~65% in tst non-reactive cattle in gb, thereby highlighting the added benefit of combining multiple antigens in serologic assays.

CONCLUSIONS
the present findings demonstrate the potential for use of antibody tests in tb-affected herds to rapidly identify m. bovis-infected, but tst non-reactive cattle. the dpp assay may also be considered for use in series with tst as a movement test, particularly as the assay may be applied pen-side without the need for laboratory equipment and results are available within 20 min. for example, mexican cattle are required to have a negative cft within 60 days of entry into the us. thus, the dpp assay could be applied after cft in mexico or at the us/mexico border as a further safeguard against entry of m. bovis-infected cattle into the us. for this application, given a very low disease prevalence in the large number of cattle crossing the us border with recent cft negative results, a viable serologic assay would need to have an extremely high specificity  to provide an acceptable positive predictive value at a low pre-test probability. in the case of the dpp assay, the target specificity can be established and validated by having a cut-off value adjusted to meet this key requirement without a significant loss of diagnostic sensitivity. given the limited number of samples available for the study, present findings should be considered preliminary and more extensive studies particularly in other bovine tb endemic countries are warranted to further verify the utility of this approach. these studies should also include sera from cattle infected with non-tuberculous mycobacteria  to determine the possible interaction of these mycobacteria on this approach, particularly as injection of ppds for sicct in cattle vaccinated with heat inactivated johne’s disease vaccine may induce false positive responses to mpb83/70-based antibody assays  <cit> . with that said, present findings clearly demonstrate that use of serologic assays in series with tst can identify a significant number of tst non-reactive tuberculous cattle for more efficient removal from tb-affected herds.
