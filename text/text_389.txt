BACKGROUND
cancer is a complex genetic disease that exhibits remarkable complexity at the molecular level with multiple genes, proteins and pathways and regulatory interconnections being affected. treating cancer is equally complex and depends on a number of factors, including environmental factors, early detection, chemotherapy and surgery. cancer is being recognized as a systems biology disease  <cit> , as illustrated by multiple studies that include molecular data integration and network and pathway analyses in a genome-wide fashion. such studies have advanced cancer research by providing a global view of cancer biology as molecular circuitry rather than the dysregulation of a single gene or pathway. for instance, reverse-engineering of gene networks derived from expression profiles was used to study prostate cancer  <cit> , from which the androgen-receptor  emerged as the top candidate marker to detect the aggressiveness of prostate cancers. similarly, sub-networks were proposed as potential markers rather than individual genes to distinguish metastatic from non-metastatic tumors in a breast cancer study  <cit> . the authors in this study argue that sub-network markers are more reproducible than individual marker genes selected without network information and that they achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus non-metastatic tumor signaling. using genome-wide dysregulated interaction data in b-cell lymphomas, novel oncogenes have been predicted in-silico  <cit> . finally, taking a signaling-pathway approach, a map of a human cancer signaling network was built  <cit>  by integrating cancer signaling pathways with cancer-associated, genetically and epigenetically altered genes.

gene expression profiling has been widely used to investigate the molecular circuitry of cancer. in particular, dna microarrays have been used in almost all of the main cancers and promise to change the way cancer is diagnosed, classified and treated  <cit> . however, expression analyses often result in hundreds of outliers, or differentially expressed genes between normal and cancer cells or across time points  <cit> . owing to the large number of candidate genes, several different hypotheses can be generated to explain the variation in the expression patterns for a given study. in addition, the preferential expressions of some tissue-specific genes present additional challenges in expression data analyses. nevertheless, recent systems approaches have attempted to prioritize differentially expressed genes by overlaying expression data with molecular data, such as interaction data  <cit> , metabolic data  <cit>  and phenotypic data  <cit> .

human malignancies are not just confined to genes and gene products, but also include epigenetic modifications such as dna methylation and chromosomal aberrations. however, in order to effectively capture the properties that emerge in a complex disease, we need analytical methods that provide a robust framework to formally integrate prior knowledge of the biological attributes with the experimental data. the simplest heuristic will search for novel genes with a profile, in terms of differential expression and/or network connectivity, similar to those for which an association to disease has been well established .

boolean logic has been found to be optimal for such tasks. within the context of cancer, mukherjee and speed  <cit>  show how a series of biological attributes including ligands, receptors and cytosolic proteins, can be included in the network inference. more recently, mukherjee and co-workers  <cit>  introduced an approach based on sparse boolean functions and applied it to the responsiveness of breast cancer cell lines to an anti-cancer agent. in addition, large scale literature-based boolean models have been used to study apoptosis pathways as well as pathways connected with them.

in this study, we propose a systems biology approach to predict disease-associated genes that are either not previously reported  or poorly characterized and using colorectal cancer as a case study. to achieve this goal, we first implemented a boolean logic schema derived from cancer-associated genes and developed a guilt-by-association  algorithm, which is subsequently applied in a genome-wide fashion. although gene expression data are central to this approach, other biologically relevant functional attributes, such as tissue specificity, are treated as equally important in the boolean logic informing the gba algorithm. finally, novel cancer-associated genes are interlaced with the known cancer-related genes in a weighted network circuitry aimed at identifying highly conserved gene interactions that impact cancer outcome.

the resulting set of variables  are each binarized and used in a boolean logic framework. the boolean logic is then applied to cancer-associated genes to develop a gba algorithm. when applied to non cancer-associated genes, the gba algorithm preferentially ranks those genes whose behavior across all variables most mimics that of cancer-associated genes. finally, in order to gain a global understanding of the novel candidate genes, we generate a series of gene co-expression networks. the resulting networks are surveyed with a focus on the interacting partners of candidate genes and within the context of the original functional attributes.

differentially expressed and condition specific genes
we explored three measures of differential expression  and identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes for de <dig>  de <dig>  and de <dig>  respectively. we observed several overlaps among the three differentially expressed gene categories, and  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed in all three categories . among them, we highlight clca <dig>  crnde, defa <dig>  duoxa <dig>  gcg, klk <dig>  and ugt2a <dig>  in particular, crnde  was the most differentially expressed  gene with a 16-fold change in expression. crnde gene is localized to chromosome  <dig>  and is poorly characterized with no functional information on its role in colorectal cancer except its differential expression from the est data . another differentially expressed gene klk <dig> is a member of the kallikrein gene family which is well documented biomarker for the detection of colon, ovarian and pancreatic cancers  <cit> .

in addition, we identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> condition specific genes for normal, adenoma, carcinoma and inflammation, respectively. among these genes,  <dig> were found to be specific to carcinoma  . notably, ccdc <dig>  ereg, il <dig>  pappa, serpine <dig>  tfpi <dig> and thbs <dig> are a few examples of the condition specific genes that appeared as top candidates. in particular, ccdc <dig>  and tfpi <dig>  genes were the most carcinoma-specific genes.tfpi <dig> has been proposed to be a tumor suppressor gene as it's frequently methylated in colorectal cancer  <cit> . the ccdc <dig> encoded protein is predicted to be localized to extracellular matrix  <cit>  with no previous association with colorectal cancer. higher il- <dig> levels might be prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer as they are associated with increasing tumor stages and tumor size, with metastasis and decreased survival  <cit> .

expression-profiling analyses often result in hundreds of candidate genes. the challenge is exacerbated when the expression data are gathered at different time points or in multiple conditions, as in the current study with a number of differentially expressed and condition specific genes. nevertheless, it is a common practice to stop the in-silico expression analysis with the list of outliers and select one or more genes for experimental characterization based on the underlying biology. often, expression data analyses are accompanied by downstream bioinformatics investigations such as gene ontology  enrichment, pathway mapping and network reconstruction. it is also believed that expression data are not sufficient to accurately reconstruct biological networks  <cit>  and that the incorporation of additional biological data is required to constrain the number of plausible hypotheses. we approached this challenge by first identifying the most relevant functional attributes that has been well documented in cancer and then extracting this information to build a boolean logic.

boolean logic to develop a guilt-by-association  algorithm
we developed a model to infer a gene's association to cancer. the model accommodates biologically motivated semantics into a boolean logic schema, but is of a probabilistic nature, allowing it to efficiently and effectively accommodate noise in biological concepts and data when ranking candidate genes .

we trained the model from data based on the behavior of the cancer-associated genes across  <dig> binarized boolean variables: the three measures of differential expression , the four measures of condition specificity , and the six cancer-biology attributes as previously described. at least one of the  <dig> variables was assigned to  <dig> of the  <dig> cancer-associated genes. these were used to construct a probabilistic boolean truth table  with  <dig> combinations .

the trained model is efficient in weighing each attribute based on firmly established principles in cancer biology. for instance, more than 30% of the cancer-associated genes encode protein kinases  <cit>  and this information is implemented 'as is'. in addition the proportion of kinases that undergo a ptm is also stored in the model and applied to non cancer-associated genes to capture similar kinases that harbor ptm but are strongly controlled by differential expression or condition specific properties in a given expression study. furthermore, the flexibility of this method lies in its ability to simultaneously address different aspects of cancer. for example, the model predicts novel biomarkers by analyzing the genome-wide expression profiles and exclusively selecting secreted proteins as functional attributes. this will identify differentially expressed or condition specific secreted proteins expressed in blood/serum/urine.

next, we sought to obtain an overview of the representation of the  <dig> binarized boolean variables across different gene classes which might provide additional insights into features of cancer genes in comparison to other genes. we selected the following four categories of genes: i. all the genes included in the analyses ; ii. the cancer-associated genes , iii. the candidate genes processed by the gba algorithm ; and iv. the top candidate genes . figure  <dig> shows the distribution of the four gene categories across the  <dig> variables. we observed enrichment for ptm and secreted proteins in both cancer-associated and top candidate genes. for instance, 40% of cancer-associated genes encoding protein had a ptm and 98% among the top candidate genes. similarly, 8% and 47% of genes encoded for secreted proteins in cancer-associated genes and top candidate genes respectively. these results lead us to inspect the coverage for ptm and secreted protein both in cancer-associated genes as well as other genes as they contributed significantly in ranking the candidate genes. additional file  <dig> table s <dig> shows exclusive and combined distribution of secreted proteins and ptm. using chi-square test of independence, we examined the association of these two functional attributes and obtained a significant p-value of  <dig>  e- <dig>  this indicates that the association of ptm and secreted proteins either in combination or individually in cancer associated genes are significantly different compared to other genes. finally, we note that the boolean logic that gives rise to the gba algorithm operates by exploiting the combinatorial nature of the  <dig> variables. although, ptm are over-represented in both cancer-associated genes and hence candidate genes, their inclusion as one among five attributes was necessary as aberrant activation of signaling pathways drives cancer progression. for example, phosphorylation  <cit> , glycosylation  <cit>  and ubiquitination  <cit>  have been documented to play key role in cancer progression.

computational validation of the analytical approach
we designed a two-step approach to ascertain the inferential validity of the proposed gba. in the first step, we processed all genes through the boolean logic using the previously developed probabilistic truth table. we found that known cancer genes received an average boolean score of  <dig>  , compared to an average score of  <dig>   for the other genes. this indicates that our boolean logic yields a score to cancer genes that is on average  <dig> -fold higher than that of candidate genes. this odds ratio was used as the threshold to be applied for the calibration in the second step of the validation.

the second step of the validation consisted of a standard cross-validation schema by which a random 4/ <dig> of the cancer genes comprised the training sample used to build the gba to be tested against the remaining 1/ <dig> of the cancer genes . after repeating this process  <dig> times, each with a different 4/ <dig> training/1/ <dig> testing random samples, we found that a ranked list of candidate genes comprising the top  <dig> % of genes guarantees a  <dig> -fold over-representation of cancer genes . we also found that selecting the 50% most extreme genes, captures 90% of all cancer genes .

when the subject is concerned with the identification of differentially expressed genes after normalising the data, one can invoke the gaussian distribution to produce p-values. similarly, when the issue is to ascertain enrichment of a particular biological process, one could invoke the hypergeometric distribution to produce p-values.

however and quite importantly, no parametric distribution functions were invoked in the development of the boolean logic and the subsequent guilt-by-association algorithm. instead, the sensitivity of the proposed approach in terms of its power to detect cancer genes was explored using a two-step procedures comprised of first assessing its efficiency when applied to cancer-associated genes, and then developing a cross-validation schema to identify the threshold beyond which the power to detect candidate genes is higher than the one obtained with known cancer-associated genes.

the emergence of ranked candidate genes from the gba algorithm
excretory-secretory proteins as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers
es proteins are particularly relevant in colorectal cancer because most colorectal cancers develop slowly; beginning as small benign colorectal adenomas that progress over several years to larger dysplastic lesions that eventually become malignant. a total of  <dig> genes encoding es proteins were found using this approach, of which  <dig> genes were tissue-specific to the colon.  <dig> entries had evidence for a ptm and  <dig> genes showed methylation in colon cell lines. among these, we highlight pyy and guca2b. pyy  is a gut hormone highly expressed in the colon  <cit>  and down regulated eight-fold in adenomas compared with the normal colon . its distinct variation in expression levels in the colon and gut region  compared with the cancerous colon makes it an important candidate gene for detailed biochemical characterization. as pyy is down regulated in carcinoma, it is unlikely candidate for early detection as decreased levels of protein in the cancer would not alter levels in the peripheral blood. guca2b  is a physiological regulator of intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport, 8-fold down regulated in adenoma, and its expression is observed in blood and urine  <cit> . therefore, guca2b could be exploited as a non-invasive biomarker for the early detection of colorectal cancer.

transcription factors as novel oncogenic regulators for the treatment for colorectal cancer
the altered activity of a few key tfs results in aberrant expression of their target genes, which can eventually lead to tumor development. the combination of the gba and regulatory impact factor  analyses yielded  <dig> tf genes. thirty-eight of these tfs showed colon-specific expression,  <dig> genes had dna methylation and  <dig> proteins encoded by tfs had evidence for at least one ptm . here, we highlight the biological relevance of the top two candidates: spib and mef2c. spib is an adenoma condition-specific down regulated gene. the dna-binding ets domain of spib is highly homologous to the ets domain from the oncoprotein spi-1/pu. <dig>  <cit>  and may be an oncogenic tf awaiting experimental characterization. in addition, spib interacts with the promoter region of the c-jun oncogene and mapk <dig> gene  <cit>  that are implicated in several cancers, including ovarian cancer. similarly, mef2c has been proven to play a role in angiogenesis  <cit> , and shown to be over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> .

genes encoding protein kinases
a total of  <dig> genes encoding protein kinases were identified of which  <dig> were tissue-specific and  <dig> genes were dna methylated: ephb <dig>  npr <dig> and trpm <dig>  ephb <dig> is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates several developmental processes  <cit> . importantly, ephb <dig> interacts with the fyn oncogene in vivo, and ephb <dig> has a suggested role in tumor suppression. other kinases predicted by the gba include npr <dig>  a novel guanylate cyclase that catalyzes the production of cgmp from gtp and trpm <dig>  also called channel kinase  <dig>  which is significantly down regulated in adenomas.

post-translational modifications
ptms such as glycosylation also go awry in cancer cells. this is seen as a result of the initial oncogenic transformation and a key event in the induction of invasion and metastasis in cancer  <cit> . by treating ptms of proteins as a separate functional attribute in the boolean logic, we found a total of  <dig> genes whose protein product harbors at least one ptm. a total of  <dig> entries with a ptm were tissue-specific with four overlapping the kinase set and  <dig> being secreted proteins, some of which had already been described in the previous sections. reg3a, a secreted protein that undergoes a proteolytic cleavage  is up-regulated in adenomas, and could be a potential biomarker for the early detection of colorectal cancer.

dna methylation as an epigenetic modification
dna methylation  patterns are altered in cancer cells, as shown by the hypomethylation of oncogenes and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes resulting in gene silencing and gene inactivation respectively  <cit> . using genome-wide dna methylome data for colon, we obtained  <dig> genes from the gba algorithm as methylated genes.  <dig> of these genes have a preference for colon tissue expression and  <dig> of them were transcription factors,  <dig> proteins with a ptm and  <dig> secreted proteins. the adamts <dig>  guca2b, pyy and thbs <dig> genes were hypomethylated, whereas fxyd <dig> and wwtr <dig> were hypermethylated  <cit> . dnam information can serve as additional evidence for these genes as potential candidate genes and should be further investigated.

gene co-expression networks reveal novel associations between cancer and candidate genes
it is thought that co-expressed genes are co-regulated by similar regulatory mechanisms; hence, possible functional collaborations between co-expressed genes have been proposed. to obtain a holistic view of the relationship between known and novel genes identified by the gba algorithm, we constructed a series of gene co-expression networks using highly correlated differentially expressed and condition specific genes. each network contained  <dig> genes including the  <dig> cancer-associated genes and the  <dig> candidate genes that were captured by at least one of the seven expression-based variables . of the  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> correlations evaluated in each network, the proportion found to be significant  according to pcit algorithm and varied from  <dig> % for the adenoma network to  <dig> % for the carcinoma network . the nodes  and edges  which were conserved in three or more network were retained to build what we referred to as the 'always-conserved network'.

clustering coefficients  and percent overlap computed from the ratio of common links divided by the total number of unique links for positive  and negative  links across each pair-wise network comparison.

the always-conserved network shown in figure  <dig> was further dissected into eight different networks and investigated for their properties. the first four networks were built in such a way that all the functional attributes were included. in essence, the first network  represents pairs of genes connected in  all four networks,  all four networks except normal or  all four networks except carcinoma. the second network  retains only those connections involving at least one top candidate gene. in the third network , connections involving at least one top candidate gene where both genes have more than two connections are retained. finally, the fourth network  contains the least number of nodes among those connections involving at least one top candidate gene with a significant connection in all the four networks. the remaining four networks were constructed based on similar functional attributes. for instance, the tf-tf only  network was built, in which only those connections where a transcription factor is connected to another transcription factor are retained. similarly, other networks based on the post-translational modifications , secreted proteins  and kinases  were built. the always-conserved networks are scale-free networks and the connectivity of the network follows a power-law distribution . we addressed four key questions in the network analysis section:  which of the top candidate genes are hub genes?  are there novel functional links between cancer and non-cancer-associated genes?  are there any highly connected gene modules functionally relevant to cancer? and  what is the nature of the attribute networks ?

our network analysis identified a number of hub genes including several top candidate genes . a notable, high impact module with guca2b as a hub gene with  <dig> connections is significant . guca2b was connected to other top candidates such as guca2a, chga and importantly the nuclear receptor nr3c <dig>  which is highly implicated in leukemia  <cit> , colorectal carcinoma  <cit> , and other carcinomas. interestingly, chga was found to be the central link between two modules, one with guca2b as a hub and another module where pyy, gcg and chgb, all candidate genes, were connected. because these connections are based on significant correlations between gene pairs, they provide the first insights towards functional collaborations among the candidate genes found in this study. a number of network relationships were found among cancer-associated and non-cancer-associated genes. the mmp <dig> gene product which promotes tumor progression and metastasis by the degradation of the extra-cellular matrix  <cit>  was connected to genes encoding candidate secreted proteins, c <dig> s and col5a <dig> 

we further explored functional relationships between cancer-associated and non-cancer associated genes by conducting enrichment analysis of go categories using the bingo plug-in  <cit> . among the top ten over-represented go terms were anatomical structure development, immune response, response to stress and negative regulation of biological process. notably, over-representation of go category of importance from the colorectal cancer viewpoint is the inflammatory response, as chronic inflammation is widely believed to be a predisposing factor for colorectal cancer particularly in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases; however the underlying molecular links between these two conditions have remained elusive. the only documented example is the role of stat <dig> that links inflammation to tumor development in colorectal cancer  <cit> . therefore, our list of candidate genes  where inflammatory response is over-represented can be considered as potential candidates for elucidating unresolved cellular mechanisms mediating this relationship in colorectal cancer.

next, we applied a combination of the bingo and mcode plug-ins to study over-represented go categories in the sub-networks  <cit> . overall, we found  <dig> sub-networks of which the scores of five sub-networks were significant . the first sub-network comprised of  <dig> highly connected nodes and  <dig> edges . this cluster was over-represented by go terms, phosphate transport and response to external stimulus . the cluster also contains several collagen sub-unit genes . again, over-representation of cell adhesion was evident in the second cluster with membership from five cancer-associated genes including mmp <dig>  these cell adhesion molecules bind to components of the extracellular matrix and up-regulation and down-regulation of candidate genes identified in this study may play a role in cancer invasion and metastasis by altering the ability of cells to adhere to surrounding cells and the extracellular matrix  <cit> .

finally, network analysis of similar functional attributes such as the transcription factors only network and the secreted proteins only network captured additional regulatory hot spots and secreted protein modules that were not predicted with significant scores previously . these four networks are of great relevance, since they are correlated by similar expression patterns, have interrelated functional attributes and are candidate non-cancer associated genes. for instance, in the tf-tf network , the hub genes  could be seen as regulatory hot spots that control gene expression via regulation of transcription.

the rif  analysis
we have recently introduced a novel metric called rif or 'regulatory impact factors' to measure the regulatory capacity of transcription factors from gene expression data alone  <cit> . rif uses two different measures, rif <dig> and rif <dig>  to predict key regulators  in driving the phenotypically relevant component of a given co-expression network. the highest impact regulators  resulting from the rif <dig> and rif <dig> analysis are documented in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  a few notable regulators with extreme scores include sap <dig>  cdk <dig>  nr3c <dig>  nfyc, cebpb, phf <dig> and tead <dig>  of particular interest was the accurate prediction of cdk <dig> as the second-most significant regulator, recently identified as a colorectal cancer oncogene that regulates beta-catenin activity  <cit> . second, cebpb was established as a target gene for regulation in myeloid cells transformed by the bcr/abl oncogene and also has a suggested role in promoting tumor invasiveness. other potential regulators predicted by rif such as epc <dig>  sap <dig> and znhit <dig> have no previous link with cancer and therefore provide an opportunity for further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the method introduced here is highly flexible and can be implemented for any cancer type in a rather straightforward manner. tissue specificity is one of the variables in the boolean combinatorial logic that will require updating with every cancer type. for instance, one could study breast or pancreas-specific genes and their association with cancer by applying this method. nuclear receptors are considered to be ideal drug candidates for treating breast cancer. we also believe that this approach could be applied to study other hereditary diseases such as alzeimer's and down's syndrome, provided sufficient molecular attributes are available for the respective diseases. importantly, the candidate genes described here are classified based on individual attributes. hence, those genes that share a number of attributes could be ranked as more promising candidates than their counterparts. for instance, pyy is a differentially expressed, condition-specific, tissue-specific to the colon, encoded product is a secreted protein that harbors a ptm and the gene is dna hypomethylated in a colon cancer cell line. therefore, pyy could be considered as a 'master candidate' awaiting further biochemical characterization. finally, we argue that this is a holistic approach that faithfully mimics cancer characteristics, systematically predicts plausible cancer-associated candidate genes and has universal applicability to the study and advancement of cancer research.
