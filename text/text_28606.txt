BACKGROUND
phase  <dig> conjugation reactions are vital for the biotransformation of lipophilic molecules to more soluble, excretable substances. by counteracting reactive metabolites of xenobiotics and oxygen , phase  <dig> reactions provide important protection against the ros-induced oxidative tissue damage that is associated with many diseases and aging. in addition, phase  <dig> reactions target diverse chemical substrates, thus presenting a significant barrier to both the activity and toxicity of therapeutic drugs  <cit> . phase  <dig> reactions are also involved in the biosynthesis of hormones and inflammatory mediators  <cit> . enzymes supporting phase  <dig> detoxification reactions, such as those involved in the biosynthesis of glutathione  and its conjugation to substrates , are rapidly induced following exposure to stressful stimuli. this response is highly conserved, reflecting the key role of phase  <dig> detoxification reactions in protecting cells against ros-induced damage. indeed, there is growing evidence that increased levels of phase  <dig> enzymes have beneficial effects by preventing adverse drug reactions, protecting against carcinogens and promoting longevity  <cit> . on the other hand, increased phase  <dig> defences can also have negative consequences, for example, rendering tumour cells resistant to treatment  <cit> .

given the medical significance of phase  <dig> reactions, there is substantial interest in elucidating how these important stress and drug defences are regulated. studies of the mechanisms regulating inducible phase  <dig> gene expression have focused upon the regulation of the cap and collar  transcription factor family that is important for this induction  <cit> . cnc transcription factors, such as nrf <dig> -like 2) in mammals and skn- <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans, mediate transcriptional control of phase  <dig> genes. the activity of these transcription factors is regulated at multiple levels, including transcription, translation, nuclear localization and protein stability  <cit> . for example, the activation of nrf <dig> in response to certain xenobiotics is mediated by chemical modifications of keap <dig> that prevent it from targeting nrf <dig> for degradation  <cit> . however, the mechanisms by which other xenobiotics and endogenous reactive chemicals induce the up-regulation of phase  <dig> genes are poorly understood.

studies of c. elegans have provided important insight into the regulation of phase  <dig> genes. skn- <dig>  the c. elegans orthologue of nrf <dig>  activates expression of phase  <dig> genes, including γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase , which catalyses the rate-limiting step of glutathione synthesis  <cit> . in c. elegans, the intestine is the first line of defence against xenobiotics. skn- <dig> in the intestine is activated in response to stress  to increase intestinal expression of gcs- <dig> and other phase  <dig> detoxification genes. several signalling pathways regulate levels of active skn- <dig>  for example, phosphorylation of skn- <dig> by the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase , pmk- <dig>  is important for stress-induced increases in nuclear skn- <dig> that result in increased phase  <dig> gene expression and oxidative stress resistance  <cit> . in contrast, insulin signalling and gsk-3-mediated phosphorylation both inhibit skn- <dig>  <cit> , as does interaction with the wd40-repeat protein wdr- <dig>  <cit> . however, the identification of genes that influence gcs- <dig> expression by skn-1-independent mechanisms  <cit>  suggests the existence of additional mechanisms for regulating phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression.

we have previously found that in the absence of the 2-cys peroxiredoxin, prdx- <dig>  which detoxifies peroxides, expression of phase  <dig> detoxification genes  and resistance to arsenite-induced oxidative stress are increased. for example, a stress-inducible gcs-1p::gfp transcriptional reporter is expressed at significant levels in the intestine of prdx- <dig> mutant c. elegans even under normal growth conditions. notably, this increased gcs- <dig> expression and arsenite resistance are only partially dependent on skn- <dig>  <cit> . hence, to identify new regulators of stress-induced phase  <dig> gene expression, we have conducted a genome-wide rna interference  screen to identify genes required for the elevated intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression in a prdx- <dig> mutant. as predicted, a significant number of these genes are also required for the increased intestinal expression of gcs-1p::gfp in wild-type animals under stress conditions . partial characterization of the most robust candidates reveals that our screen has identified new activators of pmk- <dig> and skn- <dig>  which are important for the arsenite-induced expression of multiple phase  <dig> genes and arsenite resistance. however, our data suggest that the majority of candidate genes may promote arsenite-induced gcs- <dig> expression by alternative mechanisms, outside or downstream of the pmk-1/skn- <dig> pathway. indeed our study reveals unanticipated, additional complexity in the regulation of phase  <dig> detoxification systems and stress resistance in animals.

RESULTS
genome-wide rnai screening identifies genes regulating gcs-1p::gfp expression
to identify new activators of phase  <dig> gene expression, particularly genes that are required for the stress-induced intestinal expression of these genes, we performed a genome-wide rnai screen for genes required for the elevated intestinal expression of gcs-1p::gfp in the prdx- <dig> mutant background  <cit> . as intestinal expression of gcs-1p::gfp was assessed in the progeny of rnai-treated worms , this prevented us from examining whether rnai targeting of essential genes affected gcs-1p::gfp expression. however, incidentally, this allowed the identification of  <dig> genes that may be specifically required for development or reproduction in the absence of prdx- <dig> .figure  <dig> 
results of rnai screening
. rnai screening identified genes that are  synthetic lethal with prdx- <dig> or  required for stress-induced, intestinal expression of a phase  <dig> detoxification transcriptional reporter gene . first,  <dig>  rnai clones were screened in prdx- <dig> gcs-1p::gfp background, which contains increased, detectable ‘low’ levels of intestinal gfp  in addition to wild-type levels of constitutive pharyngeal gfp expression   <cit> . of the  <dig> rnai clones that produced embryonic lethal , lethal  or sterile  phenotypes ,  <dig> had not previously been reported to affect growth or reproduction in screens of wild-type animals  <cit> . following re-screening of these  <dig> genes three times,  <dig> rnai clones repeatedly produced emb, let and/or ste phenotypes . of the  <dig>  wells containing at least  <dig> viable progeny in the initial screen,  <dig> rnai clones were scored that increased intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression, such that more than 50% of animals in the well had a ‘high’ level of gcs-1p::gfp expression throughout the intestine  . another  <dig> rnai clones reduced gcs-1p::gfp expression, such that more than 50% of animals in these wells had no detectable intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression  . these  <dig> rnai clones were re-screened three times and subjected to secondary screens:   <dig> clones were discovered to reduce the intestinal expression of non-phase  <dig> gene f09e <dig> ::gfp  <cit> ;   <dig> clones reduced intestinal gst-4p::gfp expression ;   <dig> clones reduced gcs-1p::gfp expression in prdx- <dig> mutants on each of four separate occasions ; and   <dig> of these clones reduced arsenite-induced intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression in wild-type worms  in each of three trials but did not reduce f09e <dig> ::gfp expression . gfp, green fluorescent protein; rnai, rna interference.



although the purpose of this screen was to identify genes that were required for the elevated intestinal expression of gcs-1p::gfp in prdx- <dig> mutant animals, in the course of screening,  <dig> rnai clones were noted that increased the expression of gcs-1p::gfp still further . these included rnai targeting genes encoding e01a <dig> , a glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit and wdr- <dig>  a wd40-repeat protein that negatively regulates skn- <dig>  <cit> . both of these genes were identified by previous screens for inhibitors of phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression, confirming that our screening conditions were effective at identifying regulators of gcs-1p::gfp  <cit> . rnai targeting glutathione synthetase  also increased gcs-1p::gfp expression, providing further evidence that feedback control acts to increase gcs- <dig> levels when glutathione synthesis is inhibited  <cit> .

genes required for gcs-1p::gfp expression overlap with genes required for resistance to ionizing radiation and longevity
it was found that  <dig> rnai clones  prevented intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression . secondary screens determined that  <dig> of these genes were also required for the intestinal expression of a transcriptional gfp reporter of a non-phase  <dig> gene, indicating a broader role in intestinal gene expression . accordingly, these genes were eliminated as candidate phase  <dig> gene regulators. importantly, this analysis indicated that the majority of targeted genes are not generally required for intestinal gene expression or gfp stability.

although the function of more than one-third of the identified genes is unknown, bioinformatic analysis revealed the remainder to represent a broad range of biological processes . to identify possible functional overlaps, we compared the results of our screen with published rnai screens of the same rnai library. this revealed a statistically significant overlap  between the genes we have identified and those found to be required for resistance to ionizing radiation    <cit> . this suggests that the role of these particular genes in ir resistance might be to up-regulate phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression to protect against free radicals that are generated by ir. a significant overlap  was also found between genes required for gcs-1p::gfp expression and those required for the increased lifespan of insulin receptor  mutants   <cit> . this supports other studies that have suggested a positive correlation between the expression of phase  <dig> detoxification systems and lifespan  <cit> . indeed, consistent with the vital role of gcs- <dig> in arsenite resistance  <cit> , six of the seven genes required for both the longevity of daf- <dig> mutants  <cit>  and intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression were important for the resistance of wild-type animals to arsenite . this suggests that, as well as the increased lifespan, these genes may be important for the increased stress resistance associated with reduced insulin signalling. however, of the four genes previously identified as required for resistance to ir  <cit> , only dnj- <dig> was also important for arsenite resistance  and cand- <dig> rnai actually increased arsenite resistance . this suggests that alternative mechanisms to promote stress resistance can compensate for the reduced induction of gcs- <dig> figure  <dig>

identification of new genes required for arsenite-induced gcs- <dig> expression and resistance to arsenite
next we examined whether candidate regulators of gcs- <dig> affected the expression of a second phase  <dig> transcriptional reporter gene, gst-4p::gfp, which is detectably expressed in the hypodermis/body wall muscle and intestine of wild-type animals under normal conditions  <cit> . strikingly, of the  <dig> rnai clones initially identified, only  <dig> reduced the intestinal level of gst-4p::gfp expression . this provided further corroboration that genes identified by our screen are not generally required for intestinal gene expression or gfp stability. however, quantitative analysis of a subset of  <dig> candidates, identified  <dig> additional clones that significantly reduced intestinal gst-4p::gfp expression in prdx- <dig> mutant animals . this suggests that approximately half of the genes identified as important for intestinal expression of gcs- <dig>  might also be important for the elevated expression of other phase  <dig> genes in animals lacking prdx- <dig>  notably, none of these rnai clones prevented pharyngeal gcs-1p::gfp or hypodermal gst-4p::gfp expression. although the effectiveness of rnai may be reduced in the pharynx, this suggests that they are not required for housekeeping levels of phase  <dig> gene expression in other tissues.

although identified rnai clones were likely to include any that can rescue the defects of the prdx- <dig> mutant, we predicted our screen to have also identified genes required for the increased intestinal expression of phase  <dig> detoxification genes under stress conditions, here mimicked by loss of the peroxidase prdx- <dig>  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we examined whether candidate genes were also required for the arsenite-induced expression of gcs-1p::gfp in wild-type animals. although high throughput rnai screens for c. elegans have intrinsically high false negative rates  <cit> , we reasoned that less reproducible effects were also likely to indicate rnai clones with more marginal effects on intestinal gcs-1p::gfp. hence, we chose the  <dig> most robust rnai clones that ablated intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression in prdx- <dig> mutants in each of four separate screenings . importantly, the reproducibility of these clones also indicates that the rnai treatment was consistently effective. excitingly, more than half of these rnai clones  prevented arsenite-induced, intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression in at least one of three trials, indicating that our screen had successfully identified new candidate activators of arsenite-induced phase  <dig> gene expression . as the most robust of these candidates, the  <dig> rnai clones that prevented arsenite-induced, intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression in each of three trials, were selected for further analysis .table  <dig>

sixteen rnai that prevented any detectable intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression in prdx- <dig> mutant animals and in more than 50% of wild-type animals treated with 1 mm arsenite for 90 min  on each of three occasions on which they were screened, following quantitative analysis, but which did not reduce intestinal expression of a non-phase  <dig> reporter gene, f09e <dig> ::gfp . these genes were placed into categories based on gene ontology  <cit> . where rnai affected gst-4p::gfp expression in wild-type  or prdx- <dig> mutant animals  the effect is indicated by an arrow. where rnai produced a greater than 10% change in gcs- <dig> or gst- <dig> mrna levels in arsenite-treated animals , arsenite resistance , pmk- <dig> phosphorylation in arsenite-treated animals  or levels of skn-1s393a::gfp in intestinal nuclei  this is indicated. statistically significant differences from control animals are indicated . nd, not determined; rnai, rna interference; wt, wild type.



first, we examined whether these  <dig> potential new activators of arsenite-induced gcs- <dig> expression were required for arsenite-induced increases in endogenous gcs- <dig> expression. analysis of the gcs-1p::gfp reporter line suggests that the constitutive, pharyngeal expression, which is unaffected by these clones, is likely to make a substantial contribution to total gcs- <dig> mrna levels. nevertheless, the increased intestinal expression of gcs- <dig> following arsenite treatment is reflected in an approximately  <dig> -fold increase in total gcs- <dig> mrna  <cit> . hence, we examined whether rnai clones targeting a subset of  <dig> genes, representative of each functional category , affected the total levels of gcs- <dig> mrna in arsenite-treated animals. these rnai clones all reduced total gcs- <dig> mrna levels in arsenite-treated wild-type animals, with seven out of twelve clones producing a statistically significant decrease. in many cases, gcs- <dig> mrna levels were reduced to 40% to 50% of vector control levels, approximating gcs- <dig> mrna levels in untreated animals and thus indicating that induction by arsenite was greatly impaired . thus mrna analysis is consistent with the reporter screens, strongly suggesting that the majority of genes in table  <dig> are important for the arsenite-induced expression of gcs- <dig> . notably, only ten of these sixteen rnai’s reduced the intestinal expression of gst-4p::gfp in either wild-type or prdx- <dig> mutant animals . hence, to further test the generality of the role of candidate genes in phase  <dig> gene expression, we investigated whether the subset of  <dig> rnai affected the arsenite-induced expression of another phase  <dig> gene, gst- <dig>  which is also induced two- to threefold by arsenite  <cit> . this revealed that rnai targeting five of these genes  significantly reduced gst- <dig> mrna levels in arsenite-treated animals . however, rnai targeting of other candidate genes either had little effect, or in two cases, csn- <dig> and apb- <dig>  actually significantly increased gst- <dig> mrna levels . together with our reporter analysis , this suggests that while some genes are more broadly required for stress-induced phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression, others may be specifically required for the stress-induced expression of gcs- <dig> .

next we examined whether these  <dig> genes were important for arsenite resistance. notably, rnai targeting of four genes  significantly increased the sensitivity to arsenite toxicity . however, in most cases arsenite resistance was unaffected or only slightly reduced . moreover, similar to cand- <dig> rnai , rnai targeting of a second regulator of protein homeostasis, csn- <dig>  actually increased arsenite resistance . this contrasted with the effects of other rnai clones identified by our screen, but was consistent with the increased intestinal gst-4p::gfp and gst- <dig> mrna levels observed in csn- <dig> rnai-treated animals  and the previously reported role of csn- <dig> in regulation of phase  <dig> detoxification genes and peroxide resistance  <cit> . csn- <dig> is a component of the cop <dig> signalosome , which, as a multisubunit complex, influences protein turnover by removing the ubiquitin-like modifier nedd <dig> from cullin-ring ubiquitin ligases  <cit> . in agreement with these previous studies, our data suggest that csn- <dig>  and other csn subunits, suppress basal phase  <dig> gene expression under normal growth conditions  but are required for stress-induced increases in gcs- <dig> expression  . notably, although gcs- <dig> induction is impaired in csn-deficient animals , the high basal gcs- <dig> expression and increased expression of other phase  <dig> detoxification genes, e.g., gst- <dig> , is sufficient to confer increased oxidative stress resistance   <cit> . this suggests that for survival following exposure to an acutely toxic level of arsenite, basal levels of phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression may be more important than the ability to induce gcs- <dig> . strikingly, despite their increased resistance to acute oxidative stress, under normal growth conditions csn-deficient animals were short-lived .figure  <dig>

csn- <dig>  csn- <dig> and csn- <dig> rnai significantly  reduce the basal and arsenite-induced intestinal expression of gcs-1p::gfp in prdx- <dig> mutant animals,  reduce the arsenite-induced expression of gcs-1p::gfp in wild-type animals,  increase the arsenite resistance but  reduce the lifespan of wild-type animals compared with animals maintained on empty vector control. in  and , levels of intestinal gfp were assessed under the fluorescent stereoscope using the scoring criteria illustrated in figure  <dig> and described in methods. statistically significant differences between rnai-treated samples and empty vector control are indicated. **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> .  the survival on  <dig>  mm arsenite and  lifespan of csn- <dig>  csn- <dig> and csn- <dig> rnai were statistically significant from empty-vector-control-treated animals . each experiment was repeated at least twice with similar results. gfp, green fluorescent protein; rnai, rna interference; wt, wild type.



the role of genes required for arsenite-induced gcs-1p::gfp expression in arsenite-induced activation of pmk-1
having established that candidate genes were required for arsenite-induced gcs- <dig> expression  but had different effects on the arsenite-induced expression of other phase  <dig> genes  and/or arsenite resistance , we proceeded to investigate the mechanisms by which selected candidate genes  promoted stress-induced gcs- <dig> expression. first, we examined whether these genes contributed to known mechanisms involved in arsenite-induced phase  <dig> gene expression. an important response to arsenite is the activation of pmk- <dig> by sek-1-mediated phosphorylation. following activation, pmk- <dig> phosphorylates skn- <dig> increasing nuclear skn- <dig> levels and promoting gcs- <dig> expression  <cit> . hence, we tested whether genes required for arsenite-induced activation of gcs-1p::gfp  were required for pmk- <dig> activation. strikingly, only rnai targeting the toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor domain protein, tir- <dig>  reduced the arsenite-induced activation of pmk- <dig> . this suggests that the other genes are required for alternative, pmk-1-independent, mechanisms to activate gcs-1p::gfp. indeed, there was even an indication that many rnai clones caused an increase in pmk- <dig> phosphorylation, perhaps reflecting a compensatory activation of pmk- <dig> when other signalling pathways are disrupted .figure  <dig>

tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig> are required for arsenite-induced activation of the p38-related mapk, pmk-1
previous studies have shown that tir- <dig> and the mapkkk nsy- <dig> are both required for the activation of pmk- <dig> in response to pathogenic infection but not for responses to arsenite  <cit> . hence, to confirm our rnai data suggesting that tir- <dig> is required for arsenite-induced activation of pmk- <dig> , we examined the phosphorylation of pmk- <dig> in wild-type, tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig> mutant c. elegans. consistent with previous studies, treatment of wild-type animals with 5 mm arsenite caused a rapid increase in the level of pmk- <dig> phosphorylation that was maximal by 5 min   <cit> . in contrast, there was no detectable phosphorylation of pmk- <dig> in tir- <dig> or nsy- <dig> mutant c. elegans after 5 min arsenite treatment. this suggests that tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig> are both required for the arsenite-induced activation of pmk- <dig>  indeed, although nsy- <dig> was not identified by our initial genome-wide screen, both tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig> rnai significantly reduced the level of gcs-1p::gfp induced by arsenite in wild-type and prdx- <dig> mutant animals . moreover, consistent with the important role of pmk- <dig> activation and gcs- <dig> expression in resistance to arsenite  <cit> , tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig> mutant animals were significantly more sensitive to arsenite toxicity than wild-type animals . thus, here we have identified that tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig>  which are required for pmk- <dig> activation during infection, are also important for activation of pmk- <dig> in response to arsenite. importantly, the inability of tir- <dig> rnai treatment to increase further the arsenite-sensitivity of pmk- <dig> mutant animals  suggests impaired pmk- <dig> activation underlies the arsenite-sensitivity of tir-1-deficient animals .figure  <dig> 
tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig> are required for responses to arsenite.  western blot analysis of the phosphorylation of pmk- <dig> in wild-type , tir- <dig> , nsy- <dig>  and pmk- <dig>  mutant animals before and following treatment for the indicated times with 5 mm sodium arsenite. this revealed that tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig> are both required for the phosphorylation of pmk- <dig>  which occurs maximally within 5 min of arsenite treatment. β-tubulin levels are shown as a loading control.  the basal and arsenite-induced intestinal expression of gcs-1p::gfp is reduced following tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig> rnai treatment of prdx- <dig> mutant and in wild-type animals treated with arsenite. *** indicates a statistically significant difference from vector control p <  <dig> ; ** indicates a statistically significant difference from vector control p <  <dig>  . 
tir- <dig>  and nsy- <dig>  mutant animals are significantly more sensitive to 10 mm arsenite than wild-type  . all experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results.  assessment of the viability of tir- <dig> rnai and vector-control-treated wild-type and pmk- <dig> mutant animals on  <dig>  mm arsenite revealed that tir- <dig> rnai increases the arsenite-sensitivity of wild-type  but not pmk- <dig>  animals. statistical analysis: wild-type vector vs tir- <dig> rnai, p < <dig> ; pmk- <dig> vector vs tir- <dig> rnai, p =  <dig> ; wild-type vector vs pmk- <dig> vector, p <  <dig> . gfp, green fluorescent protein; rnai, rna interference.



candidate rnai that reduces levels of skn- <dig> in intestinal nuclei has broad effects on arsenite-induced phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression
next, we focused on determining how other candidate genes promoted arsenite-induced gcs- <dig> expression. the arsenite-induced expression of gcs- <dig> is highly dependent on the skn- <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . although pmk-1-dependent phosphorylation is important for accumulation of skn- <dig> in intestinal nuclei, skn- <dig> activity is also regulated by other mechanisms. for instance, phosphorylation of skn- <dig> by gsk- <dig> or the insulin-regulated akt/sgk kinases directly inhibits skn- <dig> activity  <cit> . accordingly, we investigated whether other genes identified by our screen might be required for the activation of skn- <dig> by a pmk-1-independent mechanism. as the basal levels of skn-1::gfp in intestinal nuclei are normally undetectably low, to test this hypothesis we examined whether candidate genes  affected the nuclear abundance of a constitutively active form of skn- <dig> in which the gsk- <dig> phosphorylation site had been mutated; skn-1s393a::gfp  <cit> . unexpectedly, rnai targeting several genes, including k04g <dig>  and apb- <dig>  substantially increased nuclear skn-1s393a::gfp levels . moreover, whereas wild-type skn-1::gfp was undetectable in the intestinal nuclei of control animals, these rnai clones also caused wild-type skn-1::gfp to be detected in the intestinal nuclei of a significant number of animals . thus, paradoxically, loss of k04g <dig>  and apb- <dig> prevents arsenite-induced increases in intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression  and gcs- <dig> mrna levels , despite increased levels of nuclear skn- <dig> . this suggests both genes act downstream of skn- <dig>  or through parallel skn-1-independent pathways, to promote gcs- <dig> expression. notably, apb- <dig> and k04g <dig>  rnai did not prevent the arsenite-induced expression of four other phase  <dig> genes, gst- <dig>  gst- <dig>  dhs- <dig> and sdz- <dig> . indeed, consistent with the increased levels of nuclear skn- <dig>  gst- <dig>  gst- <dig>  dhs- <dig> and sdz- <dig> mrna levels were even slightly increased in apb- <dig> and k04g <dig>  rnai-treated animals . this indicates apb- <dig> and k04g <dig> , like csn- <dig>  and potentially other genes identified by our screen , are not universally important for the arsenite-induced expression of all phase  <dig> genes but specifically required for arsenite-induced increases in gcs- <dig> mrna expression.figure  <dig> 
activators of

have diverse effects on skn- <dig> and expression of other skn- <dig> target genes. some candidate activators act independently or downstream from skn- <dig> to increase gcs- <dig> expression whereas others, such as ufd- <dig>  are required for nuclear skn- <dig> levels and arsenite-induced expression of multiple phase  <dig> detoxification genes.  the effect of  <dig> rnai that reduce intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression in prdx- <dig> mutant and arsenite-treated animals  on the levels of a constitutively active form of skn- <dig>  present in intestinal nuclei  <cit> . rnai that produced a statistically significant decrease  or increase  in nuclear skn- <dig> levels are indicated. the data shown were obtained in three independent experiments.

although the reductions in pmk- <dig> activity associated with tir- <dig> rnai  were insufficient to inhibit nuclear accumulation of the hyperactive skn-1s393agfp mutant , excitingly, rnai clones targeting thoc- <dig> and ufd- <dig> significantly reduced the levels of skn-1s393a::gfp in intestinal nuclei, indicating that ufd- <dig> and thoc- <dig> are required for nuclear skn- <dig> abundance . skn- <dig> activity is essential for the c. elegans transcriptional response to arsenite  <cit> . indeed, in contrast to apb- <dig> and k04g <dig> , thoc- <dig> and ufd- <dig> were important, not only for the arsenite-induced expression of gcs- <dig>  but of several other skn-1-regulated phase  <dig> genes . indeed, ufd- <dig> rnai produced a statistically significant reduction in the total mrna levels for all five phase  <dig> genes that we investigated.

to test whether the associated reduction in skn- <dig> activity could underlie the reduced arsenite-induced phase  <dig> gene expression in these ufd-2-deficient animals , we examined whether wdr- <dig> rnai, which increases skn- <dig> activity and intestinal expression of gcs-1p::gfp   <cit> , bypassed the requirement for ufd- <dig>  the inability of ufd- <dig> rnai to reduce intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression in wdr- <dig> rnai-treated animals  suggests that loss of wdr- <dig> increases skn- <dig> levels sufficiently to restore normal expression of phase  <dig> genes to ufd-2-deficient animals. these data are consistent with ufd- <dig> promoting arsenite-induced phase  <dig> gene expression and oxidative stress resistance by increasing skn- <dig> activity. moreover, despite normal levels of pmk- <dig> phosphorylation, but consistent with the reduced skn- <dig> activity and arsenite tolerance associated with ufd- <dig> rnai, ufd- <dig>  mutant animals  were also more sensitive to arsenite toxicity than wild-type animals .

discussion
conserved mapk  and cnc transcription factors  are vital for stress-induced increases in phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression and accordingly protect both normal and tumour cells from xenobiotic/drug-induced oxidative damage. although work has focused on the regulation of p <dig> /nrf <dig>  activity, here we provide evidence that the regulation of stress-induced increases in phase  <dig> gene expression in animals is much more complex than previously appreciated. our rnai screening in c. elegans has uncovered new genes that are required for the elevated expression of a phase  <dig> detoxification gene  under stress conditions . partial characterization of some of the most robust candidate genes has identified new genes required for the arsenite-induced activation of pmk- <dig> and skn- <dig>  however, despite pmk-1's critical role in promoting arsenite-induced gene expression  <cit> , our data suggest that many of these new activators of gcs- <dig> expression participate in novel mechanisms to promote phase  <dig> gene expression that are downstream or independent of pmk- <dig> . for example, ufd- <dig> is required for skn- <dig> activity but not pmk- <dig> activation . moreover, our screening has revealed genes, such as mthf- <dig> and f22f <dig> , that are important for arsenite-induced increases in the expression of multiple phase  <dig> genes without apparently affecting either pmk- <dig> or skn- <dig> activity. this raises the intriguing possibility that a significant number of genes identified here may contribute to the stress-induced activation of phase  <dig> genes by mechanisms outside of the canonical pmk-1/skn- <dig> pathway.figure  <dig> 
proposed model indicating the different roles of candidate activators in the activation of phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression
. tir- <dig>  nsy- <dig>  thoc- <dig>  ufd- <dig>  k04g <dig> , apb- <dig> and csn- <dig> participate in the activation of phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression and oxidative stress resistance. in c. elegans the skn- <dig> transcription factor is essential for phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression and oxidative stress resistance. levels of skn- <dig> in intestinal nuclei are normally low due to inhibitory phosphorylation by  gsk- <dig>   <cit>  and  insulin-regulated kinases  <cit>  and  interaction with wdr- <dig>  which inhibits dna binding  <cit> . oxidative stress increases the phosphorylation of the pmk- <dig> mapk. active pmk- <dig> phosphorylates skn- <dig>  increasing levels of skn- <dig> in intestinal nuclei, phase  <dig> gene expression and oxidative stress resistance  <cit> . our data suggest that tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig> are important for arsenite-induced activation of pmk- <dig> but that thoc- <dig> and ufd- <dig> act downstream of pmk- <dig> to promote skn- <dig> activity by unidentified mechanism. intriguingly, our data suggest that several candidates identified by our screen, including apb- <dig>  csn- <dig> and k04g <dig> , may be dispensable for the expression of other phase  <dig> detoxification genes but act to increase expression of gcs- <dig> via unidentified mechanisms downstream or independently from pmk- <dig> and skn- <dig>  we suggest that the increased nuclear levels of skn- <dig> in apb- <dig>  csn- <dig> and k04g <dig>  rnai-treated animals, which have lower arsenite-induced gcs- <dig> expression , could indicate that glutathione contributes to a feedback mechanism to inhibit skn- <dig> . ros, reactive oxygen species.



identification of new genes required for the activation of specific or multiple phase  <dig> genes
skn- <dig> is generally important for the stress-induced expression of multiple phase  <dig> genes. consistent with this, the new activators of pmk- <dig> and skn- <dig> that we have identified, are important for the activation of multiple phase  <dig> genes . indeed, like skn- <dig>  <cit> , ufd- <dig> is also required for intestinal gst- <dig> expression under non-stress conditions . however, our data suggest that many of the genes identified here may be specifically important for the stress-induced expression of gcs- <dig> . studies of yeast have revealed that transcriptional responses to oxidative stress involve the activation of parallel signalling pathways and transcription factors to coordinate the expression of distinct and overlapping sets of phase  <dig> genes  <cit> . excitingly, our data suggest that alternative pathways, involving some of the genes identified here, may also contribute to the regulation of different subsets of phase  <dig> genes in animals. for instance, unexpectedly, we have identified several genes  that are required for stress-induced increases in gcs- <dig> even in the presence of high levels of nuclear skn- <dig>  this suggests that arsenite-induced gcs- <dig> expression also involves other regulators acting downstream of pmk- <dig> to promote skn- <dig> activity specifically at this promoter. in addition to participating in the glutathionylation of toxic electrophiles, glutathione has a key role as a cell redox buffer. hence, the presence of these additional regulatory mechanisms may be important for allowing gcs- <dig> expression and glutathione biosynthesis to be regulated independently from other phase  <dig> genes .

high basal levels of phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression protect against acute stress conditions but do not necessarily extend lifespan
rnai targeting subunits of the csn increase the expression of phase  <dig> reporter genes in wild-type animals  <cit> . hence, we were surprised when our screen identified csn- <dig> amongst the genes required for the elevated gcs-1p::gfp and gst-4p::gfp expression in the prdx- <dig> mutant background. however, our further analysis has revealed that, despite high basal levels of phase  <dig> gene expression and increased levels of nuclear skn- <dig>   <cit> , csn-deficient animals are unable to effectively increase the expression of gcs- <dig> in response to arsenite . despite this attenuated response to arsenite, csn-deficient animals are more resistant to both arsenite  and another oxidative stress-causing agent, tert-butyl peroxide  <cit> . indeed, analysis of other genes identified here indicates that the inability to induce gcs- <dig> expression , does not necessarily correlate with a lower arsenite tolerance . accordingly, we propose that in conditions of acute arsenite toxicity, basal levels of gcs- <dig> expression may be more important for survival than the ability to increase gcs- <dig> mrna levels. this suggests that approaches to increase the basal levels of phase  <dig> gene expression may be effective as a means to prevent the acute toxicity associated with particular drugs  <cit> .

despite their increased oxidative stress resistance, csn-deficient animals are short-lived . this is consistent with increasing evidence that there is not necessarily a direct correlation between resistance to environmental oxidative stress and longevity. for example, prdx- <dig> mutant animals have high basal expression of phase  <dig> detoxification genes and are more resistant to arsenite but age prematurely and are short-lived  <cit> . it is possible that the short lifespan of csn-deficient and prdx-2-deficient animals reflect unrelated functions of the csn and prdx- <dig>  however, these findings do support other studies suggesting that constitutively high levels of phase  <dig> detoxification can be deleterious  <cit> . thus, although increased skn- <dig> activity can extend lifespan  <cit> , the ability to regulate phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression in response to changes in the environment may also be important.

tir- <dig> and nsy- <dig> are required for pmk-1-dependent responses to oxidative stress and pathogens
our analysis of the most robust regulators of gcs- <dig> expression identified tir- <dig> as important for arsenite-induced activation of the p38-related mapk, pmk- <dig>  tir- <dig> and the mapkkk nsy- <dig> are required for activation of pmk- <dig> in response to pathogens and for the resistance of c. elegans to infection  <cit> . here we have shown that tir- <dig> is also required for the induction of phase  <dig> detoxification gene expression and resistance to the oxidative stress-causing agent, arsenite. this indicates that arsenite and pathogens may activate similar signalling pathways/defence mechanisms and raises the intriguing possibility that the expression of phase  <dig> detoxification genes may contribute to the role of tir- <dig> in protecting against pathogenic infection. this is consistent with recent studies revealing that skn-1-dependent expression of phase  <dig> detoxification genes is important for c. elegans resistance to bacterial infection  <cit> .

identification of genes that interact with prdx-2
our screen has also uncovered genetic interactions with prdx- <dig>  for instance, in the course of screening we identified  <dig> genes that may specifically be required for the development or reproduction of animals lacking prdx- <dig> . consistent with a functional overlap between these genes and the peroxidase prdx- <dig>  functional analysis revealed that many encoded stress defence proteins . indeed, the  <dig> rnai clones that produced the most severe phenotype, preventing the survival or growth of prdx- <dig> mutant c. elegans, included three targeting genes encoding peroxide-detoxifying enzymes: two catalases  and the mitochondrial 2-cys peroxiredoxin . this suggests an essential role for peroxide-detoxifying enzymes that is partially redundant with prdx- <dig> .

many of the rnai clones that caused a reproducible loss of intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression in prdx- <dig> mutant worms did not affect the induction of gcs-1p::gfp by arsenite in wild-type animals. these will include any rnai clones that specifically rescue the defects responsible for the elevated intestinal gcs-1p::gfp expression in prdx- <dig> mutant animals or that are more specifically required for the induction of gcs- <dig> in response to other stresses, e.g., peroxide. further studies to distinguish between these possibilities may uncover stress-specific pathways to up-regulate phase  <dig> detoxification genes. alternatively, by identifying genes required for prx-specific effects on signalling, this may improve our understanding of how signalling functions contribute to the conserved role of prx in longevity  <cit> .

genes identified by this screen may include potential therapeutic targets for prevention or treatment of cancer and age-associated diseases
the important role that phase  <dig> detoxification enzymes play in protecting against drug and stress-induced cell damage has stimulated interest in developing ‘chemopreventive’ agents to increase their levels and prevent the toxic and carcinogenic effects associated with this oxidative damage. conversely, phase  <dig> detoxification enzymes afford tumour cells important protection against chemotherapeutic agents, including arsenic -based drugs  <cit> . our study provides important insight into the genes and pathways involved in up-regulating one of these enzymes in c. elegans. the conservation of stress response pathways suggests that human orthologues of these genes may provide new targets for approaches to manipulate the levels of phase  <dig> enzymes, to either protect cells or potentiate the toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs. for instance, the human orthologue of ufd- <dig>  ube4b, has been proposed as a new target for chemotherapy, following the discovery that ube4b promotes p <dig> degradation  <cit> . if the function of ufd- <dig> is conserved and ube4b is important for nrf <dig> activity, this raises the possibility that increased levels of phase  <dig> detoxification enzymes may also contribute to the survival of cancer cells expressing high levels of ube4b. this would also indicate potential unwanted side effects of inhibition of ube4b, including increased risk of adverse drug reactions.

in addition to the implications for chemotherapeutic interventions, our study supports the notion that the ability to up-regulate these defences in response to stress is important for longevity. as such it also provides new avenues to explore in the quest to delay or prevent the onset of age-associated diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
the regulation of the expression of phase  <dig> detoxification enzymes in animals is more complex than previously appreciated, involving both general and gene-specific mechanisms.
