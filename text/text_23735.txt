BACKGROUND
the mitogen-activated protein kinases  pathways are activated by dual phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues in their activation loops  <cit> . to regulate the mapks, proteins that dephosphorylate at serine/threonine and tyrosine residues have evolved. one class of phosphatases that dephosphorylate serine/threonine and tyrosine residues is dual specificity phosphatases   <cit> . our laboratory has previously identified one of the members of the dusp family, dusp <dig>  as critical for vascular development and disease  <cit> . dusp <dig> is well characterized to specifically interact and dephosphorylate phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase , and does not act on other map kinases, such as p <dig> and jnk  <cit> . also unique to dusp <dig> is that it localizes solely to the nucleus, and its expression is induced by active perk signaling  <cit> . therefore, dusp <dig> acts as a negative feedback loop on active perk signaling. it was also shown that dusp <dig> is phosphorylated by perk and can retain inactive erk in the nucleus, thus providing another layer of tight regulation  <cit> .

structurally, dusp <dig> is predicted to have two globular domains; an n-terminal erk binding domain  and a c-terminal phosphatase domain   <cit> . a crystal structure of the dusp <dig> pd  <cit>  reveals a potential binding site for the phosphate of perk, which was occupied by anionic sulfate groups. the pd domain is in part responsible for dephosphorylating perk to erk. previously, we identified a mutation in dusp <dig> that changed the serine to proline residue at the 147th position  in patients afflicted with vascular anomalies  <cit> . vascular anomalies are inborn errors of developmental pathways, and are classified broadly into two groups, namely vascular tumors and vascular malformations. vascular tumors such as hemangiomas appear after birth, rapidly grow within the first 6 months, and suddenly involute, resulting in scarring and other complications  <cit> . vascular malformations, on the other hand, are present at birth and are sustained throughout the life of the individual, while affecting arteries, veins and lymphatics. the identified s147p mutation, which is uniquely located in the linker region adjoining the ebd, could potentially interfere with the dephosphorylating activity of the dusp <dig> protein on its substrate perk, and thus contribute to the inception and progression of vascular anomalies.

originally thought to be purely a structural motif, we propose that the dusp <dig> linker region plays an important role in dusp <dig> binding with perk. to assess whether s147p mutation has a consequence on dusp <dig> activity, we generated a glutathione-s-transferase -tagged version of both wild type dusp <dig> and mutant s147p proteins. here, using biochemical assays and computational modeling, we have demonstrated that the s147p mutation results in reduced dusp <dig> activity and describe a potential novel role for the linker region in perk binding.

methods
cloning of gst-dusp <dig> and gst-s147p constructs
the full-length wild type human dusp <dig> cdna was cloned in a heterologous expression system as gst-dusp <dig> fusion protein using the pgex-6p <dig> gst vector . the cdna was pcr amplified using phusion high fidelity dna polymerase kit . the pcr was performed with phusion gc buffer  containing 3% dmso on a purchased cdna template  from genecopoeia, inc. usa. the primer sequences are: . the gel purified pcr product was cloned in frame with gst in the pgex-6p- <dig> vector at the ecori and xhoi restriction sites. a single clone was selected after sequencing for protein expression. further, s147p mutation was introduced in the wild type gst-dusp <dig> plasmid by following the kit protocol as described in the quickchange lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit . the primer sequences are: hdusp5s147pf: gtggatgtaaaacccattccccaagagaagattgagagt, and hdusp5s147p: actctcaatcttctcttggggaatgggttttacatccac.

gst-dusp <dig> and gst-s147p protein expression
gst-dusp <dig> and s147p constructs were transformed into rosetta <dig> cells . pre-culture was started with picking a single colony from an overnight grown plate. ten ml of overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 l of terrific broth containing 10 ml of 40% glucose, 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. the culture was grown at 37°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm. when od  <dig> reached  <dig> , the culture was induced with  <dig>  mm iptg at 16°c for 20 h. the cells were then harvested by centrifugation with  <dig> rpm for 15 min  at 4°c. the cell pellets were re-suspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm tris hcl ph  <dig> , 1% triton x- <dig>   <dig>  m nacl, 10 mm edta, 10 mm egta, 10% glycerol, 2 mm pmsf, 5 mm dtt,  <dig>  μg/ml antipain and  <dig>  μg/ml leupeptin. the re-suspended cells were sonicated , and centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 45 min  at 4°c.

gst pull down assay
gst-dusp <dig> was absorbed to 10 μl glutathione beads with shaking at 4°c for 2 h. after extensive washing, 20 μl of sds loading buffer was added into the resulting beads. the mixture was heated for 3 min, loaded on 4-20% sds-page gels, and stained with coomassie blue.

gst-dusp <dig> and gst-s147p protein purification
gst-dusp <dig> and gst-s147p proteins were purified using affinity chromatography. the cell extract of both recombinant proteins were allowed to pass through pre-equilibrated glutathione sepharose 4b beads twice. the column was then washed thoroughly with lysis buffer and wash buffer a <dig> . the recombinant proteins were then eluted using elution buffer . the eluted protein was concentrated using centrifugal filters .

prescission protease cleavage of gst-dusp <dig> and gst-s147p
gst was cleaved off the proteins using prescission protease enzyme . for every 100 μg of protein,  <dig> u of prescission protease enzyme was used in 1x protease cleavage buffer containing 50 mm tris hcl ph  <dig> , 150 mm nacl, 1 mm dtt and 5% gycerol. the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 4°c. the mixture was then allowed to incubate with gst beads for 30 min, and passed through the column. the resultant flow through contains cleaved protein.

dynamic light scattering
dynamic light scattering  measurements at room temperature were performed on dynapro instrument  with default parameters using a 12-μl quartz cuvette. data were acquired and processed with the dynamics  software. proteins  in buffer  were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 5 minutes prior to measurement.

cd spectroscopic verification of folded dusp5
cd spectroscopy experiments were performed using a jasco j- <dig> spectropolarimeter. protein solutions were dialyzed into cd buffer containing 25 mm tris–hcl ph  <dig> , 50 mm naf, 1 mm tcep, 5% glycerol, and  <dig> % igepal. protein concentrations used for cd were adjusted to  <dig>  mg/ml and then placed in a round cuvette with a 1 mm path length. data were collected over a wavelength range of 190–260 nm. at least five scans were acquired and the averages were used for final analysis. cd spectra were deconvoluted and secondary structure prediction obtained using dichroweb  <cit>  and the k2d algorithm  <cit> .

para-nitrophenol phosphate  activity assay
recombinant dusp <dig> phosphatase activity was measured using para-nitrophenol phosphate  as a synthetic substrate, and was performed as previously described  <cit>  with modifications. assays were performed in 96-well plates at a total volume of 200 μl. in brief, 1 μm of recombinant protein was added to assay buffer containing 100 mm tris–hcl , 100 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl <dig>  1 mm dtt,  <dig> % triton-x  <dig>  the substrate, pnpp was added last to the wells at the indicated concentrations using a multichannel pipet. absorbance was measured every 30 seconds on a micro-plate reader  at 405 nm for 5 min, and the Δabs/Δt were plotted on michaelis-menten graphs with nonlinear regression best-fit curves using prism  <dig>  software .

erk dephosphorylation assay
to conduct this assay, 10 ng of gst-tagged recombinant phosphorylated human erk <dig>  was incubated with and without the indicated dusp <dig> proteins  for 5–15 min, as indicated. the reactions were halted with 2x laemmli sample buffer and subjected to sds-page. the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride  and immunoblotted using antibodies to perk  and total erk . bound antibodies were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse igg  and anti-rabbit igg , respectively, and ecl reagents  according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

homology modeling of ebd
the erk-binding domain of human dusp <dig>  was constructed with the yasara structure  <dig> . <dig> software  <cit>  using the ‘hm_build’ macro . interestingly, the top ten structures produced by yasara were based on two templates, originating from the two crystal structures  of human cdc25b phosphatase catalytic domain . besides creating the template-based models, yasara also generated a hybrid model, in which it combines the best features of the template-based models and thereby increases the accuracy of resulting model beyond each of the contributors. we refined the hybrid model as well as the best template-based structures of ebd by performing 500-ps molecular dynamic simulations  and found that the hybrid model has the lowest energy. the credibility of this hybrid model, which was used in subsequent modeling studies, was further solidified by the fact that the most conserved residues were localized on one face of ebd , as it is commonly found in various dusps  <cit> . it is noted that the above fully automated homology modeling procedure did not make use of the known structure of ebd of dusp <dig> from nmr studies   <cit> . to ensure the validity of our model, we deliberately performed homology modeling using the structure of ebd of dusp <dig> and found that the resulting structure had a low z-score value , when compared to the z-score of the hybrid model . the confidence in our hybrid model was further ascertained by the structure analysis and verification server v <dig>  and protein structure evaluation suite and server   <cit> , and details of the analysis are compiled in additional file 2: figure s <dig> 

molecular dynamic simulations
the molecular dynamics simulations were performed using amber  <dig> force field  <cit>  with a  <dig>  Å force cutoff and the particle mesh ewald algorithm  <cit>  to treat long-range electrostatic interactions. a simulation cell was defined to be cubic with periodic boundary conditions in all directions, with a distance of at least 10 Å from protein along each axis. the simulation box was filled with tip3p water  <cit>  at density of  <dig>  g/ml and na/cl ions, which were placed at the lowest/highest electrostatic potential locations to neutralize the cell and approximate the physiological saline solution . the protonation states of acidic/basic amino acids were set according to ph =  <dig> . to remove bumps and correct the covalent geometry, the structure was energy-minimized by a short steepest descent minimization, followed by simulated annealing  until convergence was reached, i.e. the energy improved by less than  <dig>  kj/mol per atom during  <dig> steps. the obtained structure was used as a starting point for molecular dynamic simulations, which were performed at t = 298 k with time step of  <dig>  fs for intramolecular interactions and  <dig>  fs for intermolecular interactions. atomic velocities were rescaled using the modified broensted thermostat, based on time-averaged temperatures, which does not depend on the strongly fluctuating instantaneous microscopic temperatures  <cit> .

RESULTS
optimization of conditions for dusp <dig> protein expression
to generate full-length dusp <dig> protein, our laboratory used an e.coli expression strategy to express the full-length human protein tagged with glutathione-s-transferase , which enhances solubility of the protein. previous attempt at generating soluble protein with histidine tag was not successful . generation of full length active and mutant dusp <dig> proteins will greatly assist structural studies and the ability to discern the mechanism of action of these proteins in the progression of vascular anomalies. the full-length human dusp <dig> was cloned into a pgex-6p <dig> vector  and dna sequencing was performed to confirm the dusp <dig> sequence. we transformed pgex-6p1-dusp <dig> into rosetta  <dig> cells. initially, temperature and iptg concentrations were empirically optimized. bacteria growth was tested in lysogeny broth  under two different temperature conditions of 16°c and 25°c . under each condition we performed + and – iptg  for comparison purposes and lysed cells by sonication to separate the soluble and insoluble components as described in the materials and methods section. dusp <dig> protein was observed by coomassie staining but, unfortunately, the dusp <dig> protein band was again observed in the insoluble cell pellet . we next varied the iptg concentrations using  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm, while maintaining the 16°c and 25°c temperature conditions. we detected the dusp <dig> protein at 16°c,  <dig>  mm iptg, and overnight induction condition . however, the protein was still observed in the insoluble cell pellet . we next switched the media from lb to terrific broth , and the expression was carried out at 16°c using an overnight induction with  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm iptg concentration . we observed a gst-dusp <dig> protein band at the correct size in the soluble fraction when induced with at 16°c with  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm iptg . however, the protein was less soluble in the  <dig>  mm iptg condition as demonstrated by the presences of a strong protein band in pellet fraction . based on the testing of various parameters, we concluded that tb media with  <dig>  mm iptg at 16°c was the best condition for generating soluble gst-dusp <dig> protein.figure  <dig>

gst-dusp <dig> protein purification
based on conditions described earlier, we generated 1 l culture of bacteria, and induced it with iptg accordingly. the e.coli cells were harvested, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% triton x- <dig>  the soluble protein was collected by sonication followed by centrifugation. purification of cell extract was carried out using glutathione sepharose 4b affinity chromatography. as shown in figure 1g, lane  <dig>  the majority of the protein bound to the glutathione-sepharose beads. to elute the bound protein, 20 mm reduced glutathione in buffer a <dig> was used. a single band of 68 kda was observed in the coomassie gel . free glutathione was removed by repeated steps of concentration of eluate followed by dilution in buffer a <dig>  the final protein yield for 1 l cell culture was  <dig>  mg. to remove the gst tag, we performed a prescission protease cleavage reaction that recognizes the prescission protease cleavage site embedded between the gst tag and dusp <dig>  following the protease cleavage, a single band of 37 kda was observed in the coomassie gel . using similar methods to wild type dusp <dig>  we also expressed, induced and purified gst-s147p protein as shown in figures 2c and d. taken together, we have successfully expressed, purified, and cleaved the gst tag to generate pure untagged dusp <dig> and s147p proteins.figure  <dig>

dusp <dig> protein characterization
to further characterize the proteins, we performed mass spectrometry , dynamic light scattering , and circular dichroism  analysis. the lc-ms/ms analysis identified peptides corresponding to  <dig> % of both dusp <dig> and s147p, with  <dig> % coverage over the entire protein sequence . to test for proper folding of our proteins we utilized cd along with dichroweb to estimate secondary structure . our cd results indicated that cleaved dusp <dig> contained 43% alpha helix and 20% beta sheet. this data tightly correlates with our predicted structure model of dusp <dig>  which contains  <dig> % alpha helix and  <dig> % beta sheet. additionally, these results correlate to previously reported cd spectra from dusp <dig>  <cit>  and similar results were obtained for all dusp <dig> constructs. thus, these results confirm the identity of the purified, cleaved dusp <dig> and s147p recombinant proteins and indicate proper folding.figure  <dig> 
protein characterization.  mass spectrometric analysis was performed by bioproximity, llc on coomassie identified bands of the appropriate size separated by sds-page. samples were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and the peptides recovered for mass spectrometric analysis.  circular dichroism was performed to determine folding and secondary structure of dusp <dig>  which was found to be 43% alpha helical and 20% beta-sheet.  dynamic light scattering predicts oligomerization of both dusp <dig> and s147p.  gst-dusp <dig> is active and sensitive to the addition of dtt. specifically, 1 mm dtt increased the activity of gst-dusp <dig> against perk <dig> in vitro.



we next performed dls, which measures fluctuations in scattering intensities emanating from particles that undergo random brownian motion. diffusion coefficient and particle size  information are determined from analyzing these fluctuations. when dls was performed on both wild type dusp <dig> and s147p proteins in solution, we observed trace amounts of very large molecular weight species  . the main protein peak is spread around 5 nm, and the polydispersity varies as well. the estimated rh range for dusp-5:  <dig>  to  <dig> ; average  rh =  <dig>  nm which corresponds to a mw of 132 kda. for s <dig>  the estimated rh ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; average  rh =  <dig>  nm which corresponds to a mw of 114 kda. the predicted molecular weight of the protein is 42 kda, and dusp <dig> protein in a dimer configuration would be 84 kda. a typical rh value of  <dig>  nm would correspond to about 86 kda. because the crystal structure of the c-terminal phosphatase domain is reported to form a dimer , we investigated whether disulfide formation between cysteine residues in the proteins would contribute to this dimer formation and accordingly activity of these proteins. addition of dtt showed a clear increase in the phosphatase activity of the wt dusp <dig> protein . the dls results and the dtt results point to possible association of protomers, likely dimers, being the dominant species in solution for both wild type and s147p proteins, as well as sensitivity to reducing environments. taking the protein characterization data together, we have successfully generated full-length, soluble, folded versions of both gst-dusp <dig> and gst-s147p proteins and their cleaved counterparts from bacteria.

activity of gst-tagged and untagged dusp <dig> proteins
to determine the activity of gst-tagged proteins, we performed para-nitrophenol phosphate  activity assay . in this assay, 1 μm of recombinant dusp <dig> proteins was added to assay buffer, and the substrate, pnpp, was added last to the wells at the indicated concentrations. absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 seconds for 5 min, and the Δabs/Δt used to calculate initial velocities, which were then plotted as michaelis-menten curves and fitted . as expected, the gst protein had no activity in this assay. interestingly, the mutant exhibited a 2-fold decrease in vmax when compared to the wild type dusp <dig> protein. the gst-s147p exhibited vmax =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min and km =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, while gst-dusp <dig> exhibited vmax =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min and km =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm . we also obtained a his-tagged dusp5-pd domain-only protein from our collaborators, which was similar to the one crystallized by jeong et al.  <cit> , and investigated its activity in the pnpp assay in comparison to the two full-length dusp <dig> proteins. interestingly, the pd alone had lower vmax  and km  than gst-dusp <dig> or gst-s147p full-length proteins, implying that the ebd domain is important for dusp5’s activity . we next investigated the activity of the dusp <dig> protein which was cleaved of its gst tag . the cleaved wt dusp <dig> shows lower vmax =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min and km =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm compared to gst-dusp <dig>  and similarly cleaved s147p shows lower vmax =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min and km =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm compared to gst-s147p . however, the trend of s147p showing decreased activity compared to dusp <dig> is consistent for both cleaved and uncleaved proteins. these results collectively suggest that mutant s147p protein is less active than wild type dusp <dig> protein and that both ebd and pd domains are necessary for full activity of dusp <dig> figure  <dig>

activity of the mutant s147p and wt dusp <dig> to perk
we complemented the pnpp assay with a second assay using the natural substrate of dusp <dig>  perk <dig> . in this assay, gst-dusp <dig> and gst-s147p  are incubated in the presence of purified perk <dig>  for  <dig> or 15 min, and dephosphorylation determined by western blot. as shown in figure 5a, incubation with gst-dusp <dig> protein decreases perk levels more than gst-s147p at both time points indicating hypoactivity of s147p to its natural substrate, perk, and corroborating the hypoactivity of s147p observed in the pnpp activity assay. we also performed a titration curve with different doses  of gst-dusp <dig> and gst-s147p proteins in the perk assay . at  <dig>  nm concentration of gst-dusp <dig>  the perk band is completely absent, and the comparable concentration for the same effect for gst-s147p is  <dig> nm, a ten-fold higher concentration . again, these data along with the pnpp assay data suggest that s147p is less active than wt dusp <dig> protein.figure  <dig>

modeling studies
to further explain the mechanism of the hypoactivity of mutant s147p protein, we performed computational modeling studies. the complete model of dusp5/perk <dig> was built using two domains of dusp <dig>  i.e. erk-binding domain  and phosphatase domain , and phosphorylated erk <dig>  the structure of pd was available from the x-ray crystallography  <cit> , while the structure of ebd was obtained by homology modeling . the crystal structure of non-phosphorylated erk <dig>  <cit>  was modified by insertion of the phosphate groups in the thr <dig> and tyr <dig> residues, and it was refined by a long  molecular dynamic simulation, during which the phosphorylated threonine  and tyrosine  residues adopted conformations similar to those reported for rat perk <dig>  <cit>  .

the initial assembly of pd with perk <dig> was guided by the fact that the x-ray structure of pd contained two sulfate ions, which were separated by ~7 Å  <cit> , and therefore it was surmised that the phosphate groups of tpo <dig> and ptr <dig> of perk <dig> occupy these same sites in the complex of pd with perk <dig>  indeed, a juxtaposition of these domains using the yasara software  <cit>  resulted in a structure, in which the phosphate group of ptr <dig> penetrated deep inside the binding site of the active center of pd, and stability of the pd/perk <dig> complex was confirmed by 8-ns md simulations. next, the z-dock protein-protein docking server  <cit>  was utilized to juxtapose ebd to perk <dig> while only taking into account the proximity of the kinase interaction motif of ebd   <cit>  and common docking motif  of perk <dig>  <cit> . the resulting structure showed not only the interaction between the requested motifs but also predicted interactions of a hydrophobic groove near the common docking motif in perk <dig>  <cit>  with the hydrophobic segment of ebd , which is likely to be important for the specificity of dusp <dig> towards erk  <cit> . furthermore, our confidence in the model was supported by the fact that the position of ebd in the predicted structure matches a large spot of highly conserved residues on the back face of perk <dig> . the resulting structure of the ebd/perk2/pd complex was refined by a 500 ps-long md simulation.

next, we connected the c-terminus of the ebd to the n-terminus of the pd in the ebd/perk2/pd complex by the linker, which consists of ~ <dig> amino acids . the position of the n-terminus of the linker corresponds to one end of a deep and long groove on top of the n-domain of perk <dig>  which suggests a possible pathway around perk <dig>  indeed, after arranging the linker in the groove on the surface of n-domain of perk <dig> and refining the structure by an 8-ns md simulation , we found that the linker not only spans the needed length but is also involved in a number of favorable interactions with perk <dig> , which facilitate effective binding.figure  <dig>

based on this model, we propose the following scenario of dusp <dig> binding to perk <dig>  first, ebd binds to the c-domain of perk <dig>  which brings the n-terminal side of the dusp <dig> linker to the beginning of the groove on top of the n-domain of perk <dig> . next, the linker arranges itself in this groove in a zipper-like action, thereby bringing pd to the phosphorylated residues of perk <dig>  finally, the two anion-binding sites of pd recognize the phosphorylated threonine and tyrosine residues of perk <dig> that are present in the pthr-glu-ptyr region of its activation loop, directing insertion of ptr <dig> into the active site of dusp <dig> , where the trans-phosphorylation or dephosphorylation reaction occurs.

to analyze the effect of the s147p mutation, we swapped ser <dig> to proline in the model of the dusp5/perk <dig> complex, and performed an 8-ns molecular dynamic simulation. analysis of the md trajectories showed that the mutation leads to structural rearrangement in dusp <dig>  which involves displacement of the ebd and n-terminal side of the linker away from the n-domain of perk <dig> . these distortions indicate that mutation of ser <dig> to proline in the dusp <dig> leads to an altered arrangement of the linker in the groove of perk <dig>  thus, we suggest that the observed reduction in the catalytic activity of the mutant s147p originates because of deviation from the optimal binding of the ebd-pd linker to perk <dig>  thereby resulting in a slower formation of pre-reaction complex and slower rate. indeed, based on the cursory examination it is expected that the conformational changes in the linker arising from serine-to-proline mutation should alter the optimal arrangement of the linker in the binding groove of perk <dig> . collectively, the molecular simulation studies provide a molecular explanation for the decreased activity of s147p towards perk when compared to wild type dusp <dig> protein.

discussion
this study defines and describes the generation of an active protein of clinical relevance, namely dusp <dig>  in milligram amounts that allows for future structure-function based studies. importantly, we describe the soluble production of full length gst-tagged dusp <dig> and mutant s147p proteins that are active. we also demonstrate that the s147p protein is less active than wild type dusp <dig> in its activity towards two distinct substrates and that the two domains of dusp <dig> are critical for its full functional activity. lastly, we provide for the first time a computational structure analysis of the erk-dusp <dig> interaction, from which we identify a potential active role of the dusp <dig> linker region in erk binding. our structural analysis also reveals a potential mechanism to the reduced activity of the s147p protein.

previously, dusp <dig> protein has been crystallized, and the source of this protein was from e.coli  <cit> . however, this crystal structure was determined from the pd alone, and the authors also included a mutation cys263ser, which was likely necessary to obtain well-diffracting crystals. we rationalized that in order to study the complete structural conformation of dusp <dig> and mutant dusp <dig>  milligram amounts of the proteins was needed in a soluble form. we utilized gst to tag dusp <dig>  since gst is known to facilitate the folding and solubility of proteins  <cit> . gst-dusp <dig> protein clearly was soluble, and our yields routinely ranged in the 5– <dig> mgs per liter concentration of bacterial culture thereby suggesting that future structure studies are feasible with scale-up. due to the bulky nature of gst  in relation to the dusp <dig> protein size , we cleaved the gst off the dusp <dig> using prescission protease. this introduced two issues:  multiple bands were observed on prescission cleavage, and  the yield dropped significantly. we sequenced the bands resulting from the prescission cleavage reactions, and confirmed that one of the bands was indeed cleaved dusp <dig> protein. although yields are low, we can scale-up the cultures to overcome this limitation of the cleaved protein. because the crystal structure of the c-terminal pd is a dimer   <cit> , it is plausible that the c-terminal pd domain of the full length protein do interact to form a dimer in solution. based on the dls data, if there is any interaction between the n-terminal domains, the hydrodynamic radius  could be higher than expected for a “strict” dimer. rh would be less if both n- and c- domains of two protomers interact with the respective partners. conversely, rh would be high if only the c-terminal domains form dimeric interaction while the n-terminal domains are only coming along because they are attached. in either scenario, the propensity of dusp <dig> to form oligomers is a property that appears to be functionally relevant since breaking disulfide bonds with dtt, and thus presumably creating single, monomeric species, altered enzymatic activity of the protein. whether the mutation in dusp <dig> has a propensity to oligomerize is a question that needs further investigation.

perk <dig>  the natural substrate for dusp <dig>  is well established in its role in endothelial cell proliferation  <cit> . the present model for binding  <cit>  has the two domains  of dusp <dig> enveloping perk <dig> on opposite faces as shown in figure 6a/a’ in a tweezer-like action. based on analogy to other map kinase phosphatases  <cit> , we expect that the ebd and pd domains of dusp <dig> bind erk cooperatively, such that the previously reported erk binding motif in the ebd  <cit>   interact with the common docking motif  of perk <dig> , and the hydrophobic segment in ebd  interacts with the hydrophobic groove of perk <dig>  as shown on figure 6b. previously, camps et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that erk binding to the non-catalytic amino-terminal domain of mkp <dig> dramatically activates the phosphatase catalytic domain. structural and physical evidence suggests that erk activates mkp <dig> through the stabilization of the active phosphatase conformation, inducing closure of the catalytic “general acid” loop  <cit> . in this closed conformation, the loop structure can participate efficiently in general acid/base catalysis, substrate binding, and transition-state stabilization. however, catalytic activity of dusp <dig> pd does not seem to require activation through binding of its substrate, perk  <cit> , and therefore the inhibition observed due to s147p mutation must arise from the structural rearrangement of the ebd–pd linker in the dusp5/perk <dig> complex. based on our molecular modeling studies, the linker in the wt dusp5/perk <dig> complex is aligned in the groove on top of the n-terminal domain of perk <dig> . the s147p mutation disrupts the optimal alignment of the linker in the perk <dig> groove due to the dramatic conformational change  and thus results in a slower formation of the pre-reaction complex and reduced catalytic activity of s147p mutant. deviation from the optimal binding of dusp <dig> to perk could result into following consequences. first, the s147p mutation can destabilize a pre-reactive complex to facilitate its dissociation to the non-interacting dusp <dig> and perk, which would lead to a further reduction in the overall reaction rate. second, the s147p mutation can as well facilitate decomposition of the post-reaction complex. we believe that the latter process is not a rate-limiting reaction step either in wt or mutant dusp <dig> complex, which is in agreement with the recent theoretical study of trans-phosphorylation in cdc <dig>  <cit> , and therefore it should not affect the overall reaction rate. however, we plan to address this question in greater detail in our future planned theoretical study.

we recreated the previously identified s147p mutation in patients with vascular anomalies  <cit>  in the gst-dusp <dig> template, and successfully generated milligram amounts of soluble s147p protein. until now, it was not known whether this mutation was a gain- or loss-of-function. our assays here imply that s147p is a loss-of-function mutation in that it dephosphorylates residues in pnpp or perk at a slower rate than wild type dusp <dig> protein; however, the physiological relevance of this drop in activity in vitro remains to be determined. if this mutation is partially responsible for the natural history of vascular anomalies, it implies that the loss-of-function mutation is likely to slow the removal of phosphates from active perk. since erk activity is often correlated with the cells ability to proliferate, such as the case in cancer  <cit> , the endothelial or vascular progenitor cell that contains the causative dusp <dig> somatic mutation is likely to lose the ability to negatively regulate perk, thus causing endothelial cell to hyperproliferate, and display the vascular anomaly phenotype. besides vascular anomalies, dusp <dig> has also been implicated as a target for cardiac hypertrophy and immune conditions. recent data suggests that small molecule histone deacetylase  inhibitors suppress cardiac hypertrophy via inhibition of dusp <dig>  <cit> . cardiomyocytes, the primary cell type involved in cardiac hypertrophy, show differential effects on erk signaling in the nucleus and cytoplasm; in that nuclear erk1/ <dig> activation is suppressed in a dusp5-dependent manner, while cytosolic erk1/ <dig> activation is maintained under these same conditions  <cit> . in regards to the role of dusp <dig> in immunology, dusp <dig> expression is induced by il- <dig> stimulation and regulates b-cell differentiation  <cit> . additionally, overexpression of human dusp <dig> in mice results in an autoimmune phenotype, as well as increased proliferation of activated memory t-cells  <cit> . therefore, finding small molecule that selectively activate or inhibit dusp <dig> in a context-dependent manner is important, and is the focus of studies in our laboratories.

CONCLUSIONS
dusp <dig> has been shown to be a critical protein involved in several disease phenotypes. therefore, to better understand the structure-function relationship of dusp <dig>  we generated and characterized both wild-type and mutant dusp <dig> while providing a comprehensive molecular model of the dusp5/erk interaction. in addition to showing decreased activity of the mutant dusp <dig>  our molecular model revealed a novel role for the dusp <dig> linker region in dusp5/erk interactions. taken together, our studies will allow for the identification of activators or inhibitors of dusp5; as well as the selective modulation of s147p’s activity rather than wild type dusp <dig> activity – a concept that is the hallmark of targeted drug discovery approaches.
