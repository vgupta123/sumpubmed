BACKGROUND
the pinnipeds are a monophyletic group of aquatic carnivores most closely related to either mustelids or ursids. the three monophyletic families – phocidae , otariidae , and odobenidae  last shared a common ancestor within arctoid carnivores >  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . some morphological studies  <cit>  and virtually all molecular studies  support a link between otariids and odobenids . however, several morphologists prefer a phocid-odobenid clade .

there are  <dig> extant species of pinniped, including monachus tropicalis  and treating zalophus as being monotypic  . the family phocidae contains  <dig> species in two subfamilies: monachinae or "southern" hemisphere seals  and phocinae or "northern" hemisphere seals   <cit> . some authors have questioned the monophyly of monachinae  <cit> , although recent studies have shown this subfamily to be monophyletic  <cit> . the monophyly of phocinae has not been questioned since being established by king  <cit> ; however, there remains considerable debate over inter-group relationships, especially within phocina . the family otariidae contains  <dig> extant species that have been divided traditionally into the subfamilies arctocephalinae  and otariinae  . early suggestions that this subfamilial classification might be incorrect  have received increasing support from recent molecular analyses  <cit> . taken together with a number of reports of both interspecific and intergeneric hybrids within otariidae , a reassessment of otariid taxonomy based on additional phylogenetic evidence is needed. brunner  <cit>  provides an extensive review of the history of otariid classification. finally, odobenidae today comprises only the single species of walrus, odobenus rosmarus.

several recent genetic studies  <cit>  have advanced our knowledge of relationships within pinnipedia considerably. unfortunately, many of these  did not include divergence-date estimates as required for some types of macroevolutionary studies and phylogenetic comparative analyses. in addition, none included all species. the only study to include divergence-date estimates for all extant pinnipeds was that of bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>  as a part of a larger carnivore supertree. this tree has been used extensively in comparative studies of carnivores in general  and pinnipeds in particular . however, it remains that the carnivore supertree is nearly a decade old and might no longer reflect current phylogenetic opinion.

our objective is to address the lack of a recent phylogenetic study that includes all extant pinniped species and to provide date estimates for all nodes. to accomplish this task, we used the supertree method matrix representation with parsimony  to derive a complete phylogeny of the group from  <dig> gene trees , with corresponding maximum likelihood  and bayesian  analyses of the concatenated supermatrix serving as a form of topological sensitivity analysis in a global congruence framework  <cit> . divergence dates within the supertree topology were estimated using  <dig> genes calibrated with eight robust fossil dates using two different methods. together, the use of a larger data set focussed exclusively on the pinnipeds should yield both a more accurate topology and divergence dates than those present in the global carnivore supertree of bininda-emonds et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
general structure of the supertree
our preferred hypothesis of pinniped evolution is that derived from the molecular supertree with all genes analyzed individually . it agrees broadly with other recent studies . in particular, the monophyly of each of pinnipedia, otarioidea, phocidae, otariidae, and the two phocid subfamilies was supported. many of these nodes are among the most strongly supported in the supertree. the high level of congruence across numerous studies using different data sources and methodologies would suggest that higher-level pinniped relationships are well resolved. however, many relationships closer to the tips of the tree, particularly those within each of arctocephalus and phocina, remain contentious.

support values within the supertree  were generally much higher than values typically reported for the supertree-specific support measure rqs , with an average rqs value  across the tree of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . as such, most nodes are directly supported by a majority of the  <dig> source trees containing all the relevant taxa. the only exception is the node comprising halichoerus grypus, pusa caspica and pusa sibirica, which has a slightly negative rqs value . even so, all more inclusive nodes possess positive rqs values, indicating that the conflict has more to do with the exact placement of halichoerus within pusa rather than the placement of it within this genus per se.

node numbers correspond to figure  <dig>  dates and 95% confidence intervals are in millions of years ago, with the latter applying to the input dates only. fossil dates correspond to those listed in table  <dig> and act as constraints on the minimum divergence time for the node in question. the date for node  <dig> was interpolated according to a constant birth model . support values for each node, as measured by rqs  <cit>  are also provided.

alternative analyses of the molecular data set  yield topologies that agree broadly with that in figure  <dig>  the rqs support measure across the supertree  again showed that most nodes are directly supported by a majority of the  <dig> source trees containing all the relevant taxa. in all cases, the changes occur in parts of the tree with noticeably weaker support and/or branch lengths, indicating general regions of uncertainty: 1) neophoca cinerea nests deeper within otariids, either as the sister taxon to phocarctos hookeri  or to the clade comprising the genera arctocephalus, otaria, and phocarctos , or forms the sister taxon to callorhinus ursinus ; 2) the formation of a sister-group relationship between otaria byronia and arctocephalus pusillus, which were previously adjacent to one another ; 3) the clades  and  trade places ; and 4) changes to the internal relationships of phocina, either with halichoerus grypus and pusa caspica being pulled basally with respect to the remainder of the group, with halichoerus forming the sister group to the remaining species , or with pusa hispida and the clade of histriophoca fasciata and pagophilus groenlandicus nesting deeper within the group , or with pusa hispida moving inside p. sibirica and with a polytomy at the base of phocini .

in the supertree, nodes  <dig> and  <dig>  represent the divergences of the canid and ursid lineages, respectively, and nodes  <dig> to  <dig> represent the various pinniped divergences. the total sample size  underlying the divergence times for each node ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . over half  of the pinniped nodes were dated using at least  <dig> separate estimates. the remaining  <dig> nodes were dated by five or fewer estimates. ten of these  <dig> nodes relate to otariid relationships, and seven concern arctocephalus species. divergences within the pusa + halichoerus clade were also dated by a comparatively small number of estimates. however, no obvious relationship existed between the variability in a date estimate  and the number of estimates it was derived from .

our inferred reldate dates for the supertree topology  are also significantly correlated with those for comparable nodes  in the two major studies to estimate divergence times within pinnipeds, those of bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>   and arnason et al.  <cit>   . however, whereas our dates did not differ significantly from those of bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>  , they were significantly more recent than those of arnason et al.  <cit>  , probably reflecting their use of a only single and more distant calibration point  as well as topological differences between the trees and different methodologies used to derive the dates.

both sets of multidivtime divergence dates  are significantly different from the reldate divergence dates . the supertree  divergence dates underestimate the multidivtime dates from all genes and mtdna genes by 88% and 51% on average, respectively. with respect to confidence intervals , only  <dig> and  <dig>  of the reldate dates fall into the range provided by the multidivtime cis for mtdna or all genes, respectively. conversely, only  <dig> and  <dig>  dates for all genes and mtdna only, respectively, fall within the cis of the reldate dates. however, it is important to note that the two sets of multidivtime dates themselves are also significantly different from one another . in the following sections, we compare both sets of divergence dates  with those from the fossil record and other studies.

origins of major pinniped groups
the split between ursids and pinnipeds is estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>   mya ), although this should not be taken to imply that ursids are the closest living relatives of pinnipeds among arctoid carnivores. early pinnipeds  are held to have originated in the north pacific during the late oligocene  , which is consistent with our estimate. thereafter, a substantial lag is apparent, with the basal pinniped split between phocidae and otarioidea occurring some  <dig> million years later at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya  . both values are more recent than the  <dig>  mya and  <dig>  mya estimates obtained by bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>  and arnason et al.  <cit> , respectively.

odobenidae includes a single extant species and at least  <dig> fossil species in  <dig> genera  <cit> , with the most basal taxa known from the late early miocene . deméré et al.  <cit>  suggest that odobenoids first evolved in the north pacific region sometime before  <dig> mya , and our data indicate the upper bound to be  <dig>  mya. the multidivtime dates were similar at ca.  <dig> mya. both values are substantially older than the  <dig>  mya estimate obtained by bininda-emonds et al.  <cit> , but younger than the  <dig>  mya estimate of arnason et al.  <cit> .

modern fur seals and sea lions are thought to have evolved from the ancestral family enaliarctidae ca.  <dig> mya  <cit> , with our data showing that the diversification of the crown group occurred shortly thereafter at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya . arnason et al.  <cit>  consider the late oligocene enaliarctinae  <cit>  to be the oldest otarioid lineage so far described . however, deméré et al.  <cit>  consider this group to be early pinnipedimorphs that originated before the evolution of the modern crown-group pinnipeds.

the first phocid fossils date from the middle miocene   in the north atlantic  <cit> , although some authors  have speculated over a north pacific origin. koretsky and sanders  <cit>  recently described the "oligocene seal" from the late oligocene  in south carolina as the oldest known true seal, a fossil that predates our estimate for the basal-most split in all pinnipeds. however, because this new description was based on a very small sample , and because deméré et al.  <cit>  noted that its stratigraphic provenience may be in question, we instead used  <dig> mya as a conservative fossil calibration point for the split between phocidae and otarioidea. obviously, acceptance of the "oligocene seal" as the oldest known phocid  would cause all divergence times within the pinnipeds to be older than the ones that we report.

otariidae
phylogeny
the supertree resolved callorhinus ursinus as sister to all remaining otariids , with neither the sea lions nor arctocephalus forming clades. the five sea lion genera were generally positioned basally to the various arctocephalus species. the exception was phocarctos , which nested within arctocephalus. wynen et al.  <cit>  also reconstructed neophoca as being the next otariid species to diverge  and found zalophus + eumetopias to form the sister clade to the remaining forms . these results add to the already large body of evidence, both molecular and morphological, that subfamilial descriptions in otariidae, traditionally based on the single character of presence or absence of underfur, are incorrect  <cit> . however, resolution of most of the more inclusive otariid clades remains problematic  <cit> , especially the relationships among the various arctocephalus species, and the placements of the a. australis + a. forsteri + a. galapagoensis and a. philippii + a. townsendi clades in particular. the likelihood-based supermatrix analyses reinforce the generally weak or conflicting phylogenetic signal in the data set for otariids, with both suggesting what is to our knowledge a novel, more nested position for neophoca .

the supertree resolved a. forsteri as the sister to a. australis + a. galapagoensis, with all three as sister to an a. gazella + a. tropicalis clade, an arrangement with relatively moderate support . wynen et al.  <cit>  found a similar result, placing a. gazella as sister to the a. australis + a. forsteri + a. galapagoensis clade, but placed a. tropicalis as sister to a. pusillus on a more basal branch separate from other arctocephaline species. our results also support a polyphyletic arctocephalus, but with a. pusillus as the separate lineage. the separation of a. pusillus from other arctocephalus species  is perhaps not unexpected in hindsight, given that this species has long been considered as having an 'enigmatic taxonomic position' due to its similarity to sea lions in size, skull morphology, and behaviour  <cit> .

several authors  <cit>  have recently questioned the status of a. philippii and a. townsendi as separate species . brunner  <cit>  went so far as to suggest that both taxa be removed from arctocephalus to form subspecies in the previously described genus arctophoca . our results are equivocal on this latter issue, given that these two taxa do form part of the main clade of arctocephalus, but as sister to the remaining species. the two taxa, however, are indicated to have diverged from one another earlier  than other another pair of undisputed arctocephalus species , a potential argument in favour of them retaining separate species status .

the close genetic relationship we found between a. australis, a. forsteri and a. galapagoensis  is also congruent with the morphometric results of brunner  <cit> , who suggested that a. galapagoensis be considered a subspecies of a. australis . again, the relatively long divergence time between these two taxa  could argue against this arrangement.

ultimately, relationships within arctocephalus remain poorly resolved with little agreement between different studies or, as shown in this study, even different analyses of the same base data set. this situation will likely remain at least until additional genes for these taxa are sequenced. we would note that the relationships and divergence times within arctocephalus presented here are based on the only genetic marker available at the time data were extracted from genbank . additional genetic sequences for these species are desperately required .

divergence dates
the only recent studies to estimate divergence dates for otariids are those of bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>  and arnason et al.  <cit> . here, we compare our estimates to those two studies and the available fossil record, which is unfortunately limited. our reldate estimate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya for the root of the otariid crown-group is younger than other recent estimates  <cit> . the multidivtime dates  agree well with bininda-emonds et al.  <cit> , but are still younger than that estimated by arnason et al.  <cit> . thereafter, a series of rapid divergences are inferred to have occurred. the origin of neophoca was estimated at  <dig>  mya based on mt-cyb only , followed by the initial radiation of the remaining species at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya , and the origins of otaria at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya and arctocephalus pusillus at  <dig>  mya . the oldest known record for the southern hemisphere otariids is established by hydrarctos lomasiensis from the late pliocene or early pleistocene . fossils from california and japan suggest that sea lions did not diversify until ca.  <dig> mya  <cit> ; however, only the late pleistocene occurrences  of otaria bryonia  <cit>  and neophoca palatine  <cit>  are considered reliable at present  <cit> . our date for the origin of the lineage leading to otaria as a whole is naturally much older than this and almost three times older than that in bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>  . arnason et al.  <cit>  estimated an older divergence time, but also based on a different phylogeny. we infer phocarctos to have split from the remaining arctocephalus species  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya. finally, the divergence between eumetopias and zalophus was dated as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, which is considerably older that the earliest known fossils , but younger than the  <dig> mya estimate of arnason et al.  <cit>  .

our results similarly indicate a rapid radiation within arctocephalus, with many species originating within the past  <dig> million years . overall, the date estimates showed reasonable levels of variation , although some were highly variable. for example, the split between the clades a. gazella + a. tropicalis and a. australis + a. forsteri + a. galapagoensis had a final date estimate of  <dig>  mya but a large se  and 95% confidence intervals on the input date , possibly reflecting weak signal in this area of the tree . arctocephaline species are known in the fossil record only from poorly documented records of a. pusillus and a. townsendi from the pleistocene   <cit> . the origin of arctocephalus + phocarctos hookeri was estimated here using mt-cyb data at  <dig>  mya, which is younger than other recent estimates based on different topologies  <cit> . although our results lend support to previous suggestions  <cit>  that both sea lions and arctocephalus underwent recent periods of rapid radiation, all the evidence to date tend to be based on a small dataset for most species.

phocidae
phylogeny
compared to otariids, phocid relationships are generally much more agreed upon. the traditional and well-accepted phocid subfamilies monachinae and phocinae were both recovered as monophyletic in the supertree and supermatrix analyses . erignathus barbatus was sister to the remaining northern phocids, followed by cystophora cristata. the next branch of the tree separated pagophilus groenlandicus and histriophoca fasciata  as the sister group to the remaining taxa . most recent studies  <cit>  have found support for this arrangement among the early branches . of the six pusa, phoca, and halichoerus species , in the preferred tree pusa hispida was found to be sister to the remaining species in which phoca vitulina + phoca largha formed the sister clade to ) . the sister-group relationship between phoca vitulina and p. largha recovered here in all analyses is consistent among and well supported in numerous studies based on diverse data types  <cit> , and reflects early suggestions that the latter species represents a subspecies of the former  <cit> .

arguably the biggest outstanding problem in phocid phylogeny concerns the placement of halichoerus within phocina, and there have been long-standing suggestions  for taxonomic revision of these taxa. both davis et al.  <cit>  and delisle and strobeck  <cit>  found the strongest support for halichoerus as sister to pusa, with both being sister to phoca. however, both studies included only pusa hispida as an exemplar for pusa. fulton and strobeck  <cit>  also recovered a similar result, but did not include pusa sibirica. four recent studies have included all three pusa species  <cit> . bininda-emonds and russell  <cit>  recovered halichoerus as sister to erignathus + histriophocina + the remaining phocina using morphological data. bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>  resolved an unresolved pusa as sister to the two phoca species in their supertree, with halichoerus being sister to this clade. the molecular results of arnason et al.  <cit>  and palo and väinölä  <cit>  were similar to ours, indicating weak support for a p. caspica + h. grypus clade, and for a basal position for p. hispida within phocina. although the precise interrelationships of the species differ slightly, our results support the suggestions of these other recent studies that both halichoerus and pusa be included within a redefined phoca, possibly as subgenera. in fact, arnason et al.  <cit>  suggested recently that the scientific name for the grey seal be phoca grypa. this solution also works in light of the continuing uncertainty concerning interrelationships within phocina , especially the increasing number of suggestions that pusa might be paraphyletic .

it is also noteworthy that all the relevant divergences within phocina apparently occurred in a very short time frame , which might make resolution within this group difficult to obtain even with additional markers. by contrast, there were no negative branch lengths in this part of the supertree , indicating relatively good agreement among the sequence data. also, except for node  <dig>  all the rqs values in this part of the  tree are >  <dig>  again indicating more agreement than conflict among the set of gene trees .

within monachinae, all analyses recovered a monophyletic monachus as sister to miroungini + lobodontini. relationships within monachus and mirounga recovered here are consistent among and well supported in numerous studies  <cit>  . relationships within lobodontini have traditionally been contentious, although recent studies  <cit>  all support the sister relationship between leptonychotes and hydrurga recovered here . however, the positions of ommatophoca and lobodon relative to each other and to the leptonychotes + hydrurga clade remain problematic. many recent studies  <cit>  found the strongest support for an )) relationship. our results differed and, similar to fyler et al.  <cit> , supported lobodon as being sister to the remaining species. the supermatrix analyses indicated the identical sets of relationships for monachinae.

divergence dates
the fossil record suggests that the divergence of the two phocid subfamilies occurred sometime prior to the middle miocene   <cit>  and we used  <dig> mya as a minimum age constraint for the corresponding node . similarly, fyler et al.  <cit>  used  <dig> and  <dig> mya as calibration points from which to estimate divergence dates in monachinae. the corresponding molecular estimate of arnason et al.  <cit>  at  <dig> mya is older still and in better agreement with our multidivtime dates. the initial divergence in phocines  was dated at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, which is slightly younger than other estimates  <cit>  . our reldate dates for the origins of cystophora  and histriophoca + pagophilus  are considerably younger than the corresponding estimates from bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>  , but considerably older than the available fossil evidence. deméré et al.  <cit>  suggested that these basal phocines originated in the arctic during the pleistocene and represent the products of a glacioeustatic-forced allopatric speciation event. arnason et al.  <cit>  estimated a considerably older date  for the divergence of cystophora, again in agreement with both bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>  and our multidivtime results, but a comparable  <dig> mya estimate for the origin of histriophocina.

the genus phoca arose  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya , with both extant species diverging from one another  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya. these two nodes were well sampled, with  <dig> and  <dig> molecular estimates, respectively. the suggested recent separation and evolution of the two phoca species  is in general agreement with other studies  <cit> . pusa sibirica arose  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, and halichoerus grypus and pusa caspica diverged immediately thereafter at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya; the divergence estimates for these last two nodes were each dated by only three genes apiece, and both are considerably older in the multidivtime analyses. bininda-emonds et al.  <cit> , by contrast, estimated the origin of halichoerus to be  <dig>  mya, although this was based on a different topology, with halichoerus in a more basal position. they also dated a pusa polytomy to  <dig>  mya, whereas we estimate here  that the three genera phoca, halichoerus, and pusa all arose over a short time span ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya . palo and väinölä  <cit>  similarly estimated that the radiation of the five main phocini mtdna lineages occurred ca.  <dig> – <dig>  mya, whereas arnason et al.  <cit>  estimated that the basal phocina radiations occurred at  <dig>  mya. sasaki et al.  <cit>  derived considerably younger estimates for divergences within pusa, although their calibration was based on an incorrect estimate of the general mammalian substitution rate  <cit> . in addition, the sister-group relationships on which their dates are based conflict with our results and those of other recent studies  <cit> . regardless of the precise relationships upon which the dates are based, the general consensus is that the diversification within phocina was both rapid and relatively recent, which agrees with biogeographic evidence suggesting that the evolution of the halichoerus-pusa-phoca complex likely occurred in the greenland sea/barents sea portion of the arctic  <cit> , and was possibly related to the closing of the panama canal  <dig> - <dig>  mya, which resulted in the freezing over of the arctic ocean  <cit> .

among the southern phocids, most nodes  were well sampled, with 12– <dig> date estimates each. the lineage leading to monachus split from the remaining species  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, which is slightly younger than other recent estimates  <cit>  . our reldate estimate of the origin of the lineage leading to m. monachus  is considerably older than the  <dig>  mya estimate of bininda-emonds et al.  <cit> , but in good accord with those of fyler et al.  <cit>  and arnason et al.  <cit> . the multidivtime dates for this node are again older, ca. 15– <dig> mya. the split between m. schauinslandi and m. tropicalis was interpolated to be  <dig>  mya, compared to  <dig>  mya estimate from bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>  .

our results indicate that the mirounga lineage split from the lobodontine seals  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya , which accords well with recent genetic studies  <cit>  and with fossil evidence indicating that the oldest fossils of southern lobodontines are from the late miocene   <cit>  and suggesting that the divergence occurred sometime before  <dig> mya  <cit> . our reldate date for the split between the two mirounga species  was slightly younger than that in other recent studies  <cit>  , but considerably older than the  <dig>  mya estimate of slade et al.  <cit> .

among the four lobodontine seals, lobodon diverged first at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, followed shortly thereafter by ommatophoca at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, and finally by hydrurga + leptonychotes at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya. the time of origin of the lineage leading to lobodon is younger than the date estimated by fyler et al.  <cit> , but older than that of arnason et al.  <cit>  . however, both it and time of origin of the lineage leading to ommatophoca correspond well to the dates of bininda-emonds et al.  <cit> . the divergence dates determined using multidivtime were again considerably older .

CONCLUSIONS
our results add to the growing list of studies that highlight the need for a re-evaluation of pinniped taxonomy, with revisions being required for both otariids  and phocids , ideally based on additional and especially nuclear genetic markers. the divergence-date estimates herein indicate rapid radiations in both families, particularly the southern hemisphere fur seals  and the northern phocids , a fact which might account for the historical difficulties in assessing the phylogenetic relationships within each group. the historically unusual, but increasingly suggested nesting of halichoerus within pusa  highlights both the utility of large molecular datasets with numerous genes and the value of including all relevant species in phylogenetic analysis . we suggest increased genetic sampling throughout the group as the best approaches to further improving our understanding of pinniped phylogenetics. for example, at the time we gathered data, only mt-cyb had been sequenced for most otariid species and only a small number of genes were available for several pusa species, although additional sequences have since been provided  <cit> . that being said, the problem areas within phocina and arctocephalus that were identified by both supertree and supermatrix analyses might prove resistant to resolution even with increased sampling should the apparent rapid branching in these parts of the tree be real.

phylogenetic comparative methods have become the standard way for comparing aspects of the biology of a group of species while avoiding statistical problems associated with species not being independent due to their shared evolutionary history  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses are improved with appropriate reconstruction of ancestral nodes using divergence-date information  <cit> , and estimates of divergence dates provide conservation biology with a powerful tool in assessing vulnerability to conservation problems and comparative analysis of extinction risk  <cit> . our results will allow the use of phylogenetic comparative methods with a robust estimate of pinniped phylogeny and divergence times that includes all species.
