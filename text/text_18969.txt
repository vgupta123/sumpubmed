BACKGROUND
intravesical bacillus calmette-guerin  is best known as the most effective agent for the treatment of high-grade superficial bladder cancer  <cit> . in this context, bcg is used to reduce both the recurrence rate of bladder tumor and to diminish the risk of its progression  <cit> . as an adjunct to transurethral resection, bcg is the treatment of choice for urothelial carcinoma in-situ  and is commonly used for recurrent or multi-focal ta and high grade t <dig> bladder lesions  <cit> . bcg also has been tested as a promising option for treatment of interstitial cystitis  <cit> .

it is not clear how bcg alters the course of cystitis or cancer progression. one theory is that intravesical bcg corrects an aberrant immune imbalance in the bladder, leading to long-term symptomatic improvement  <cit> .

recently, the susceptibility to bcg was correlated with polymorphisms of the human nramp <dig> gene  <cit> , providing interesting insights into the complexity of the genomics of bcg immunotherapy  <cit> .

that bcg causes an extensive local inflammatory reaction in the bladder wall is well acknowledged  <cit> . of this, the massive appearance of cytokines in the urine of bcg-treated cancer patients stands out  <cit> . activated lymphocytes and macrophages are the most likely sources of these cytokines, but at present other cellular sources such as urothelial cells cannot be ruled out  <cit> . bcg is internalized and processed by neutrophils  <cit> , professional antigen-presenting cells and urothelial tumor cells, resulting in altered gene expression and secretion of particular cytokines  <cit> . it was suggested that the effectiveness of bcg treatment is determined by two processes: an inflammatory one, followed by a delayed type of hypersensitivity response  <cit> . others proposed three distinct phases in the immune response to bcg. in phase  <dig>  bcg adheres to the urothelium via interaction between the bacterial antigen  <dig> complex and fibronectin  <cit>  and urothelial cells. in addition to fibronectin, it has been suggested that toll-like receptors  - <dig> and - <dig>  present in immune cells, mediate bcg-induced immune responses  <cit> . once internalized, bcg is processed both by professional antigen-presenting cells and urothelial cells, resulting in an altered gene expression  <cit> . this phase corresponds to the early release of so-called inflammatory cytokines  which may be responsible for certain adverse effects. phase  <dig> consists of recognition of bacterial antigens by cd4+ lymphocytes, which release mainly il- <dig> and ifn-γ . this cell activation leads to phase  <dig>  consisting of amplification of cytotoxic-populations: cd8+ t cells, gamma-delta lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer  cells. all of these cells also release cytokines that may further regulate the bcg response  <cit> .

more recently, studies have shown that mycobacterial dna contains high amounts of cpg motifs. these cpg motifs induce tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand  expression  <cit>  and increase serum levels of mouse keratinocyte-derived chemokine , a functional homolog of human interleukin il- <dig>  <cit> . urinary trail levels were initially undetectable in bcg therapy patients but levels increased after subsequent treatments. more importantly, patients that responded to bcg therapy had significantly higher urine trail levels, which killed bladder tumor cells in vitro versus non-responders. given this data, it was proposed that trail also plays a role in bcg-induced anti-tumor effects  <cit> . nevertheless, bcg's exact mechanism of therapeutic action remains poorly understood. although systemic reactions have been reported, a more likely scenario is that exposure to bcg results in a local immune response with massive inflammation  <cit> . this inflammatory infiltrate makes it difficult to analyze the direct effects of bcg on the urinary bladder in bcg treated patients. in order to determine the differences in bladder mucosa and detrusor gene regulation in response to bcg in comparison to those elicited by other inflammatory stimuli  we sought to differentiate bcg-specific effects from the generalized inflammatory reactivity. for this purpose, we used the c57bl/ <dig> mice because our previous work already defined the time-course of bladder inflammation and urinary cytokine release in response to intravesical instillation of bcg, tnf-α, and lps  <cit> .

comparative analysis of networks
next, the expression values  and the gene bank accession number for each specific genes was entered in the ipa database as focus genes. the interpretation of these datasets in the context of biological processes, pathways, and molecular networks composed the ipa core analysis. results of the core analysis for bcg-, lps-, and tnf-α-specific genes in the mucosa and detrusor were entered in a core comparison analysis which allows comparison of changes in biological states across the different treatments and to highlight which biological processes and/or diseases are relevant to each of the treatments. ipa computed a score for each network according to the fit of the set of supplied focus genes . these scores, derived from p values, indicated the likelihood that focus genes belonging to a network versus those obtained by chance. a score > <dig> indicates a ≥ 99% confidence that a focus gene network was not generated by chance alone  <cit> . only networks with a score above  <dig> were selected for further analysis. detrusor bcg-specific networks. from the isolated detrusor muscle,  <dig> genes were found to be bcg-specific and their networks are represented in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  network  <dig>  received the highest score  and assembles  <dig> bcg-specific genes. this network has in a central position: nf-kappab, map kinase , pi <dig> kinase, and jnk and overlays with the axonal guidance canonical pathway . in this pathway,  <dig> members of the small gtpase family were up-regulated and found upstream of map kinase signaling. in contrast, members of the atpase family such as deah  were down-regulated. in addition, a gene encoding the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase  <dig> was found linking the nf-kappab, map kinase, and erk kinase  pathways. a group of genes encoding members of the integrin pathway was also observed and included: plaur , wisp <dig>  vcam <dig>  and itgam . this network was correlated with the following functions: cell-to-cell signaling, hematological system development and function, and immune and lymphatic system development and function. network  <dig>  presents il <dig> and tgfbeta <dig> in a central position and overlays with a series of canonical pathways . a small gtpase, interferon-inducible, guanylate binding protein  <dig>  was found in this pathway downstream of il- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, several of the bcg-specific genes are related with calcium and β-estradiol metabolism, including: wisp <dig>  rock <dig> , myo1b, s100a <dig>  and cd <dig>  this network was correlated with the following functions: cell-to-cell signaling, cellular movement, and cancer. network  <dig>  presents akt and p38mapk in central positions and overlaps with the b cell receptor canonical pathway . interestingly, this network presents genes of neuronal origin such as cdh <dig> , dnaj <dig> , and ctnnd <dig> . in addition, two genes upstream of histone h <dig> were up-regulated by bcg: aatf  and arhgef <dig> . this network was correlated with the following functions: inflammation, dermatological diseases, and cellular growth and differentiation. network  <dig>  presents tnf-α in a central position and overlays with a series of canonical pathways . padi <dig> was found highly up-regulated  and encodes peptidyl arginine deiminase, type iii, a target of tp <dig>  genes downstream of tnf-α includes a pro-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  raet1b , hla-drb <dig> , rfx <dig> , and cd <dig> . in this network, tfeb was up-regulated and this gene encodes a transcriptional factor expressed in the urothelium and detrusor muscle that responds to bladder inflammation  <cit> . this network was correlated with the following functions: cancer, cell-to-cell signaling, and immunological disease. network  <dig>  presents fos, il- <dig>  and the transcription factor e2f <dig> in a central position and overlays with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor canonic pathway . interestingly, a group of genes involved in retinoic acid metabolism was highlighted, and included: ilf <dig> , hoxd <dig> , sox, mid <dig>  and gsta <dig> . this network was correlated with the following functions: cellular signaling, cancer, and cellular growth and proliferation. network  <dig> presents stat <dig> and jun in a central position and overlaps with the il- <dig> canonic pathway , . a small gtpase  was found upstream of stat <dig>  interestingly, a group of genes involved in the dihydrotestosterone metabolism was highlighted: lcn <dig>  slc16a <dig>  and smarcc <dig>  in addition, genes involved in the regulation of mmp <dig> , such as mmp <dig> were found down-regulated by bcg treatment. downstream of ctnnb <dig> , sema5a, an axon guidance molecule, was down-regulated by bcg. this network was correlated with the following functions: cellular development, development disorder, and cellular growth and proliferation.

target validation of bcg-dependent genes by q-pcr of chromatin immunoprecipitation -based assays
the validity of the predictions of transcriptome analysis was tested using chip-q-pcr because this is more definitive than confirmation of rna levels and shows genes that are being actively transcribed. we selected genes that appeared to show a clear change from the transcriptome to be tested by chip-q-pcr. for this purpose, additional mice were treated with saline or acutely and chronically with bcg, the urinary bladder was removed and an antibody against rna polymerase ii  was then used to precipitate the dna transcriptome. q-pcr was performed with primer pairs listed in table s <dig> . figure  <dig> depicts the averaged transcription events detected per  <dig> cells for each gene tested and their standard deviations. with the exception of sema5a, fvbp <dig>  igfbp <dig>  and sele, these results indicate that chronic treatment with bcg and to a lesser extent acute bcg induced up-regulation of the following genes as was predicted by the mrna-level analysis: arl <dig>  csk, dnajc <dig>  faf <dig>  gbp <dig>  gzma, hla-drb <dig>  il17b, indo, map3k <dig>  smad <dig>  tfeb, vcam <dig>  and wisp <dig> 

participation of nf-kappab in the bladder responses to bcg
because nf-kappab played a central role in several gene networks here described, we predicted that bcg induces nf-kappab translocation by using emsa. the results presented in figure  <dig> indicate that chronic bcg indeed increases the binding of nf-kappab. to further confirm this finding, we tested whether the bcg-induced increased binding of nf-kappab would lead to up-regulation of transcripts known to possess a p <dig> binding site. for this purpose, the human urothelial cancer cell line  was exposed to bcg or saline for  <dig> hours and the cells were frozen and prepared for chip-q-pcr assays. in this experiment the chromatin was precipitated with a p <dig> antibody and the following genes were found to be up-regulated by bcg: cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  icam <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> . 

morphology and immunohistochemistry of urinary bladders instilled with bcg-gfp
because of the large volume  of bcg that was administered in mice relative as compared to humans, we further investigated whether acute instillation of bcg-gfp at bladder capacity does not result in urothelial injury and microscopic extravasation of bcg or would cause artifacts, including forcing bacteria into the urothelium. for this purpose, mice were euthanized  <dig> hours following bladder instillation with bcg-gfp, the bladders were removed and frozen, and were stained with h&e or processed for fluorescence immunohistochemistry. figure 12a is a representative photomicrograph covering the whole urothelial surface. this is a composite of nine pictures at original magnification of 200× that was electronically merged. this picture shows that in our conditions the instillation of bcg-gfp does not cause any urothelial injury. figure 12b is a high magnification  of the dotted black box highlighted in figure 12a and confirms the integrity of the urothelial cell layer.

next, we used fluorescence immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that, in our laboratory conditions, instillation of bcg-gfp does not cause any microscopic extravasation of bcg or cause artifacts, including forcing bacteria into the urothelium. figures 13a–d are representative photomicrographs obtained  <dig> hours after bladder instillation of bcg-gfp. figure 13a is a dapi  that was used to highlight the nucleus. figure 13b was stained with lrg- <dig>  figure 13c indicates the presence of bcg in the urothelium as indicated by the fluorescence of gfp. it has to be noted that not only fluorescence if enough for recognition of gfp. the size is also fundamental since the urinary bladder presents high background fluorescence. in this context, specific gfp indicative of bcg are highlighted in two areas of the urothelium contained within white circles . small particles positively labeled with gfp can be noticed in those areas. in the merged picture, presented in figure 13d, it can be appreciated that most of background fluorescence coincides with dapi staining  whereas the bcg-gfp is co-localized in vesicles positives for lrg- <dig> . white arrows in figures 13a–d point to signals that are co-localizes in the merge picture . this set of figures illustrates also the absence of gfp in any portion of the urinary bladder outside lrg- <dig> vesicles. next, pictures 13b and 13c were submitted to image analysis. figure 13e represents the integrative 3d surface which translates the luminance of the image in figure 13b–c as height for the plot using the nearest neighbor sampling, next the viewing position of the plot was adjusted for the nest visualization of the surface plot. the black circles indicate the central areas of figure 13b–c with the highest density of bcg and lrf- <dig>  next, the co-localization of bcg-gfp and lrg47-rhodamine was performed by converting the figures 13b and 13c to 8-bit gray scale images  using image j software  <cit> , assigned as red and green channels, and the analysis was performed with the co-localization-finder plug-in  <cit> . the results presented in figure 13f were electronically generated by the software resulting in a merged picture with white areas indicating the co-localization between bcg and lrg-47-positive vesicles. the results were also automatically tabled and provided the following parameters: pearson's_correlation rr =  <dig> ; overlap coefficient r =  <dig> ; contribution of red channel k <dig> =  <dig> ; contribution of green channel k <dig> =  <dig> ; slope =  <dig> ; intercept =  <dig> . next, the central area of figures 13a–d was photographed at high magnification. the results presented in figures 13g–j illustrate the findings of the image analysis indicating an almost complete overlap between bcg and lrg- <dig>  and that no bcg was found outside lrg-47-positive vesicles. since lrg- <dig> vesicles are part of the endocytic pathway, it is very unlikely that the bacterium was mechanically forced into these vesicles. together these results indicate that instillation of bcg-gfp into the mouse bladder, in the conditions described in this manuscript, does not result in urothelial injury and microscopic extravasation of bcg or cause artifacts, including forcing bacteria into the urothelium.

discussion
the present study was set forth to determine unique genes modulated by bcg in the bladder target organ apart from a general inflammatory response. in this context, treatment-specific genes were used to query the ipa in order to construct molecular networks. our results indicate that some unique functions are involved in bladder responses to bcg. this includes a whole new hypothesis that bcg interferes with several genes participating in axonal guidance signaling . the latter includes a family of small gtpases that along with integrin, protein kinase d <dig>  pkc, and platelet-derived growth factor regulate axonal guidance. although this finding potentially linking bcg to axonal guidance is unique, activation of small gtpases genes by intravesical instillation of bcg into the mouse bladder was just demonstrated by our laboratory  <cit>  and we extended the results into the present work, indicating that acute bcg does co-localize with lrg <dig> vesicles. however, it remains to be determined whether the same genes exert axonal guidance properties in the urinary bladder.

another unique and exciting finding was that the primary function of network  <dig> was related to the development of the immune and lymphatic systems, including formation of lymphoid tissue and peyer's patches , size of lymphoid organs , lymph node development , degranulation of the lymphatic system , and dilation of lymph vessels   <cit> . our results suggest that bcg induces a series of genes that may lead to bladder lymphangiogenesis since their role in the development and function of the lymphatic system has been established. these included vcam <dig> , a cell surface glycoprotein implicated in the development of lymphoid tissues  <cit>  and in a variety of chronic inflammatory conditions, making its expression and function a target for therapeutic intervention  <cit> . interestingly, a role for nf-kappab regulating vcam <dig> expression has been proposed  <cit> . another gene encodes the lta  which is involved in peyer's patch development  <cit>  and is essential for inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis. indeed, genetic deletion of lymphotoxin beta receptor or lymphotoxin alpha abrogated development of lymphatic vessels in the inflamed areas in the thyroid but did not affect development of neighboring lymphatics  <cit> . also lta seems to be important in the local lymphoid tissues and lymph node development  <cit> . unlike other cytokines, lymphotoxin alpha/beta regulates the development of intestinal lymphoid organs, including peyer's patches  and mesenteric lymph nodes . in addition, intestinal inflammation is suppressed by inhibition of ltb signaling  <cit> . a role for ltb signaling has been proposed in initiating immune responses both dependent and independent of its role in maintaining the organization of lymphoid tissues  <cit> . coincidently, lymphotoxin also activates the nf-kappab pathway  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, there is only a single manuscript indicating that another bacteria, mycoplasma pulmonis induces lymphangiogenesis  <cit> . our results suggest that bcg may have a similar role. it remains to be determined if alteration of the lymphatic system is part of the beneficial responses of the bladder to bcg treatment. another finding of the present work was the participation of bcg-specific genes in networks involved in the axonal guidance canonical pathway . in addition, network  <dig> highlights genes of neuronal origin, including: cdh <dig> , dnaj <dig> , and ctnnd <dig> . the combination of these two findings raises the hypothesis that bcg treatment may impact the nervous system, possibility explaining its therapeutic role in interstitial cystitis. there are some reports already in the literature supporting this hypothesis: the immune responses to bcg mediates axon damage in rodents  <cit> ; bolus injection of bcg in rats alters the brain vasculature and predisposes subjects to thrombosis and hemorrhage  <cit> , and the supernatant of bcg-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages alters neurite development in organotypic culture  <cit> . not surprising, several networks  overlap with pathways involved in cancer. however, each one of the cancer networks provides a specific association of genes and transcription factors that form hypothesis that can be tested to further determine the role they might play in the anti-cancer action of bcg. network  <dig> has tgfb <dig> and il <dig> driving several genes known to be involved in cancer development but also known to negatively regulate potentially tissue destructive immune responses. in contrast, network  <dig>  which is involved in b cell receptor signaling, has akt and p <dig> mapk in a central position. network  <dig> has retinoic acid in a central position. network  <dig> has hras and nf-kappab in a central position and overlaps with the ppar signaling. finally, network  <dig> has il <dig> in a central position and genes such as indo that is a known target of ifn-γ. interestingly, both networks associated with tnf-α-specific genes  overlap and have as top functions cancer and cell death. regarding the networks associated with lps-specific genes ; at least the one found in the bladder mucosa was associated with the canonical pathway of lps/il <dig> mediated alterations of nuclear rxr receptors . the identification of these various networks bespeaks the complexity of bcg-induced reactions.

regarding putative transcription factors , tfeb  is known to be expressed in the mouse bladder urothelium and its activity is increased during bladder inflammation  <cit> . in addition, our chip-q-pcr results confirmed that bcg induces up-regulation of the gene encoding this tf. another tf is e2f <dig> and networks  <dig> and  <dig> present this transcription factor in a central position. interestingly, an e2f1-dependent increase in transcription was found in u <dig> bladder cancer cells emerging from quiescence upon serum stimulation  <cit> . e2f <dig> promoter activity in quiescent cells was associated with recruitment of nf-kappab. nf-kappab was replaced largely by e2f <dig> in concert with gene activation during the early stage  of serum stimulation. the finding that nf-kappab is expressed in a central position in several inflammatory networks , corroborates with the proposed role of nf-kappab as a link between chronic inflammation and cancer  <cit> . nf-kappab seems to play a major role in gene regulation in urothelial cells and several recent studies reveal a role for nf-kappab on the responses of these cells to bcg  <cit> . indeed, bcg induced il- <dig> expression by human transitional cell neoplasms requires nf-kappab and ap- <dig>  <cit> . others have presented evidence that bcg activates nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nf-kappab, since pretreatment of with sulfasalazine, an inhibitor of nf-kappab activity, blocked the ability of bcg to induce il- <dig> secretion  <cit> . others have shown that bcg induces cxcl <dig> production in epithelial cells by a mechanism involving nf-kappab  <cit> . finally, several laboratories have provided additional evidence of nf-kappab involvement in urinary bladder cancer  <cit>  and the benefits of drugs derived from curcumin, an inhibitor of nf-kappab  <cit> . recently, a functional insertion/deletion polymorphism has been identified in the promoter region of nfkb <dig> that is being proposed as a useful marker for the identification of patients with high risk of recurrence of superficial bladder cancer  <cit> . our present findings using emsa and chip-q-pcr confirmed that both the mouse urinary and the j <dig> urothelial cancer cell line respond to bcg treatment with an increased translocation of nf-kappab.

the results here presented have to be taken in light of the choices made to provide a manageable focus for this paper. this study was carried out at a single time point. we understand that this time point may not identify preceding or proceeding events as we indicated previously  <cit> . therefore, the results of regulatory network here presented should be viewed as a snapshot of the bladder transcriptome. nevertheless, genes identified as important at this time point can now be followed over time by other techniques. the study also focused on the responses that are unique to bcg, which loses sight of the larger picture of the response common to all three stimuli of inflammation. the common pathways have been considered previously  <cit> . another short coming of this type of analysis was to exclude initially genes that are commonly up-regulated by the  <dig> different stimuli. the rationale for the latter was to focus the study on genes specifically regulated by bcg in contrast to the other stimuli. by doing this, we did not discuss or further analyze the common genes involved in bladder responses to inflammation. although genes responding to more than one treatment were not considered, when treatment-specific genes were assembled in molecular networks, the network themselves shared some overlap of functions.

one of the family of genes induced specifically by bcg in the bladder mucosa belong to small gtpases  and gbp <dig> on network  <dig>  these results confirmed our recent reports using suppressive subtraction hybridization that the small gtpases are upregulated in the bladder mucosa in response to bcg  <cit> . here we went further to verify whether bcg-gfp co-localizes with one of the small gtpases. indeed, our results indicate that bcg-gfp has almost 100% coincidence with lrg-47-positive vesicles . the association of p <dig> gtpases with membranous compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi, implicate these molecules in intracellular membrane trafficking or processing  <cit>  and that mechanical stimuli alone could not be responsible for our findings. in addition, products of these genes are known to coordinate cellular defense against intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria  <cit> , possibly by promoting acidification of the phagosome  <cit>  and elimination of the intracellular pathogen  <cit> . p <dig> gtpases are one of the most effective cell-autonomous resistance systems known against intracellular pathogens in the mouse  <cit> , and have been shown to be essential for immune control in vivo of listeria monocytogenes, toxoplasma gondii, and mycobacterium tuberculosis   <cit> . in addition, mice lacking lrg- <dig> failed to control mtb replication  <cit> . thus, lrg- <dig> may serve as a critical vacuolar trafficking component used to dispose of intracellular pathogens like mtb  <cit> . therefore, it is expected that this group of gtpases may limit the activity and survival of bcg in the mouse bladder. in addition to limiting bcg activity, this group of gtpases is part of the inflammatory response. in particular, human gbp- <dig> and gbp- <dig> modulate the endothelial cell responses to inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that in the case of bcg vaccine, these gtpases may act as a controlled-release mechanism for the agent infecting the bladder.

the question arises as to the relevance of these findings to the clinical use of bcg and particularly whether the response of normal urothelium to bcg is relevant to cancer treatment. first, the major difference is that the mice used in the present work do not have cancer, and, therefore, our results are most relevant to the response of the bladder to bcg and provide no information on cancer-specific responses. a second potential difference is whether the larger volume of bcg administered relative to bladder volume in these mice as compared to human clinical use might cause artifacts, including forcing bacteria into the urothelium. our previous studies using pressure monitoring showed that at  <dig>  ml, the pressure was less than 10% of that required to produce overdistention.

the literature is remarkably mute on the presence of bcg within the urothelium within  <dig> hours of administration, and studies that reported on the absence of bcg in the bladder were performed a week after bcg administration, well after the responses documented here occurred and after much of the urothelium had sloughed  <cit> . we suggest that a deeper understanding of the sequence of the response of humans with bladder cancer treated with bcg may require biopsies within 24– <dig> hours to determine whether bcg enters the urothelium and then produces responses similar to those that occur in the mouse urothelium reported here. however, it is not practical to biopsy a human being,  <dig> hours after administering bcg. in this context, the animal model here described, with all its limitations, can facilitate investigations of the basic processes and mechanisms involved in urinary bladder responses to intravesical bcg instillation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present research approach identified genes involved in the responses to intravesical bcg therapy in the bladder target organ apart from those involved in the responses to lps and tnf-α and suggested novel mechanisms involved in the responses to bcg. the major findings of the present work suggest that bcg is involved in the development and function of immune system and lymphatic vessels. interestingly, the present work confirms our recent findings  <cit>  that bcg also up-regulates genes encoding several small gtpases, such as lrg <dig>  <cit>  that are responsible for an organism's defense to intracellular pathogens. it remains to be determined whether over-expression of small gtpases would limit the survival of bcg within the urinary bladder or whether it will contribute to a controlled-release mechanism for the agent infecting the bladder.
