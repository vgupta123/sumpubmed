BACKGROUND
gluten proteins present in wheat can cause celiac disease   <cit> . wheat gluten consists of a complex mixture of α/β-, γ- and ω-gliadins, and high and low molecular weight  glutenins, which are all encoded by medium to large multigene families. in contrast to other dietary proteins, gluten proteins are minimally digested by gastrointestinal proteases, resulting in relatively large peptides that accumulate in the small intestine  <cit> . in cd patients, during passage through the mucosal tract these gluten fragments can bind to the hla-dq2/ <dig> receptors present on antigen presenting cells  and trigger t-cell responses. this t-cell response to hla-dq2/ <dig> restricted gluten peptides occurs only in celiac patients and not in healthy controls. the hla-dq2/ <dig> receptor favors peptides that contain one or more amino acids with a negative charge  <cit> . these are not present in gluten peptides but can be introduced due to the activity of human tissue transglutaminase   <cit>  an enzyme that converts glutamine  residues into negatively charged glutamic acid  residues. gliadin peptides, with their high proline and glutamine content, are perfect substrates for the transglutaminase reaction of tg <dig>  which is critical for the creation of active t-cell epitopes involved in cd . since target sites for tg <dig> may be determined by sequences flanking the core motif, the amino acid composition of the surrounding of the epitope cores can influence the immunogenic capacity of a peptide regarding cd  <cit> .

several hla-dq <dig> and -dq <dig> restricted t-cell epitopes have been identified in wheat gluten and in homologous proteins from barley  and rye   did not respond to peptides derived from α-gliadins, but instead reacted to peptides derived from γ-gliadins and lmw glutenins. a major cd epitope derived from γ-gliadins is the dq2-γ-i epitope , recognized by one third of the patients  <cit> . among pasta and bread wheat varieties differences have been observed in the capacity to stimulate in vitro dq2-γ-i specific t-cell clones  <cit> . these facts justify an elaborated investigation of the γ-gliadins with special regard to the natural variation in cd-epitope content.

the γ-gliadins account for approximately 12% of the flour proteins of the hexaploid wheat cultivar butte  <dig>  <cit> . they are encoded by clusters of tightly linked genes present at the gli- <dig> loci  that are located on the short arms of the respective homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes  of hexaploid bread wheat   <cit>  and are tightly linked to the glu- <dig>  and gli- <dig>  loci . the number of different γ-gliadin genes in the genome of bread wheat was estimated at 15– <dig>  <cit>  and these can be clustered into four up to eleven groups  <cit> . this diversity is qualitatively reflected at the protein level  <cit> , but not all genes are expressed evenly. epitope content of the genes varies  <cit> , just as it varied among α-gliadins  <cit>  according to the genome of origin of the loci.

in the present study cd epitopes from γ-gliadins of bread wheat are considered in their natural context of deduced protein variation, tg <dig> deamidation sites, transcript frequency and genome specificity. for this purpose, we sequenced genomic γ-gliadin sequences from ancestrally related diploid triticum/aegilops species and analyzed these together with expressed γ-gliadin sequences from the ncbi database of hexaploid bread wheat  to accomplish the assignment of γ-gliadin transcripts contigs to one of the three genomic γ-gliadin loci, gli-a <dig>  gli-b <dig> or gli-d <dig>  as was previously done for the α-gliadins  <cit> . furthermore, natural occurring variants of a major γ-gliadin cd epitope, dq2-γ-i, were analysed using t-cell assays.

methods
plant material
the taxonomy of triticum and aegilops is complex, and different taxonomic systems are being used. in this paper we have followed the classification according to van slageren  <cit> . bread wheat  is an allohexaploid that was formed through hybridization and successive chromosome doubling of three diploid triticum/aegilops species. the diploid ancestors of the d genome and the a genome of bread wheat are respectively ae. tauschii  and t. urartu . ae. speltoides var. speltoides  species or closely related species have been suggested as the ancestor of the b genome, but the exact diploid progenitor remains uncertain  <cit> .

we included the following accessions in this study: ae. speltoides var. speltoides  is related to the b genome, ae. tauschii  as a d genome representative, and t. monococcum subspec. monococcum  as a representative of the a genome. the accessions were obtained from the centre of genetic resources , the netherlands, except k- <dig>  which is from n.i. vavilov all-russian scientific research institute of plant industry , st. petersburg, russia.

at 21 days after anthesis, wheat kernels in the late milk ripening stage  were grinded in liquid nitrogen and subsequently dna was extracted with chloroform/isoamylalcohol as described by van herpen et al.  <cit> .

amplification, cloning and sequencing of genomic γ-gliadin sequences
primers to amplify γ-gliadin genes from genomic dna using pcr were designed on the conserved sequences at the 5’ and 3’ end of the coding region of γ-gliadin gene sequences obtained from the embl database . primers were degenerated to cover as many different γ-gliadin sequences as possible. amplification was performed in a 25 μl reaction volume, containing  <dig>  μm reverse and  <dig>  μm forward primer, dntp mix ,  <dig> x pfu buffer  and a 1: <dig>  mixture of pfu dna polymerase   and goldstar dna polymerase  . twenty ng of genomic dna was used as a template for pcr. the pcr programs consisted of 5 min at 94°c followed by  <dig> cycles 94 °c for 1 min, 53°c for 1 min and 72°c for 2 min with a final extension at 72°c for 10 min. the pcr products were ligated into the pcrii-topo vector  and subsequently transferred into e. coli-xl1-blue cells . recombinants were identified using blue-white color selection. positive colonies were picked and grown overnight at 37°c in freeze media 2so <dig>   <dig> % v/v glycerol, 100 μg/ml ampiciline, 10 g/l tryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract and 5 g/l nacl). the cloned insert was amplified directly from the culture in a pcr reaction using the m <dig> forward  and reverse primer  in 20 μl reaction volume containing 2 μl of culture. the reaction mixture consisted of the same components as well as concentrations, and utilized the same pcr program as described before . the amplified product was used in sequencing reactions using γ1f or γ6r primers. additional primers were designed on two internal, conserved regions of the γ-gliadin gene to generate additional sequences: one internal forward primer, γfi2: 5’-ccctgcaagaattc-3’, and one internal reverse primer, γri2: 5’-gaattcttgcaggg-3’. the sequence data were manually checked using seqman . in total,  <dig> unique γ-gliadin sequences have been deposited in the embl database .

neighbor-joining analysis of genomic γ-gliadin clones
the  <dig> genomic γ-gliadin sequences derived from the diploid wheat species t. monococcum subspec. monococcum , ae. speltoides var. speltoides  and ae. tauschii , were included in alignment and distance analysis. all analyses were conducted in mega <dig>  <cit> . complete sequences were trimmed to include a region spanning sequence domain i to v of the γ-gliadin protein. due to the typical sequence repeats in the repetitive domains ii and iv, the γ-gliadin sequences differed in length, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs for ae. tauschii, from  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs for t. monococcum subspec. monococcum, and from  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs for ae. speltoides var. speltoides. next, the trimmed sequences were analyzed using the neighbor-joining method  <cit> . the neighbor-joining method returned an optimal tree with the sum of branch length =  <dig> . the sequence distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method  <cit>  in units of the number of base substitutions per site. all positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pair wise sequence comparisons . there were a total of  <dig> positions in the final dataset. codon positions included were 1st + 2nd + 3rd + non-coding. the number of base substitutions per site within species and between species was using respectively the within-group function and between-group function in mega <dig> 

analysis and genomic assignment of γ-gliadin transcripts from bread wheat
a total of  <dig> γ-gliadin transcripts originating from t. aestivum subspec. aestivum were extracted from the ncbi database . the γ-gliadin transcripts were assembled in  <dig> contigs of sequences with 98% to 99% sequence identity . the consensus nucleotide sequences of those contigs that were composed of at least four transcripts were further analyzed, resulting in  <dig> transcripts arranged in  <dig> contigs , coding for  <dig> different γ-gliadin protein isoforms,  <dig> of which are full length γ-gliadins .

the γ-gliadins are encoded by clusters of tightly linked genes present at the gli- <dig> loci  located on the short arms of the homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes of bread wheat  <cit> . to determine whether actively expressed γ-gliadin sequences from bread wheat can be assigned to a genomic locus, based on sequence relationship to one of the diploid wheat species representing the ancestors of the bread wheat genomes, as was possible for α-gliadins  <cit> , the sequences of the  <dig> expressed γ-gliadin isoforms detected in bread wheat were included in a neighbor-joining analysis together with different genomic γ-gliadins cloned from the diploid wheat species used in these studies as representatives for the ancestors of cultivated wheat. as the  <dig> different γ-gliadin isoforms were deduced from contigs of transcripts which are mostly partial sequences of expressed genes, not all of them covered the complete γ-gliadin gene. therefore, a region of  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs in length, covered by all expressed isoforms, starting with domain iii  and ending with domain v  was created and compared for sequence distances in a neighbor-joining analysis together with the same nucleotide region of genomic sequences derived from diploid triticum and aegilops genomes. the nucleotide sequence distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method  <cit>  and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset . there were in total  <dig> positions in the final dataset. the tree optimal  is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree.

cd epitope screening
the deduced amino acid sequences of  <dig> γ-gliadin contigs, encompassing the cd epitope containing regions , representing a total of  <dig> transcripts, were explored for epitopes and surrounding sequence regions using a text explorer program  after which the output file was analysed in excel for further calculations and sorting. in addition, the regions of domain ii and domain iv that harbor cd epitopes were aligned  to detect sequence variation and to reconstruct the genomic organization of γ-gliadins expressed from the respective loci, gli-a <dig>  gli-b <dig> and gli-d <dig>  sites for tryptic and peptic enzymes were identified with peptidecutter .

t-cell proliferation assay
a dq2-γ-i epitope specific t clone was generated from small intestinal biopsies of a celiac disease patient  as described before  <cit> . the patient signed an informed consent form which was approved by the hospital ethics committee. proliferation assays were performed in triplicate in 150 μl iscove’s modified dulbecco’s medium  with 10% pooled normal human serum in  <dig> well flat-bottom plates using 2x <dig> gluten specific t-cells stimulated with  <dig> irradiated hla-dq2-matched allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells  in the presence or absence of antigen . after 2 days 3 h-thymidine  was added to the cultures, and 18– <dig> hours thereafter the cells were harvested. 3 h-thymidine incorporation in the t-cell dna was determined with a liquid scintillation counter .

RESULTS
γ-gliadins from the ab, s and d genome
to analyze the genetic diversity of the γ-gliadin gene family a total of  <dig> different γ-gliadin sequences were cloned from diploid triticum and aegilops species containing the ab, s or d genome . these diploid genomes were studied because they are related to the ancestors of respectively the a, b and d genome of hexaploid bread wheat . γ-gliadins contain an n-terminal signal peptide to direct them into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. the mature protein consists of a unique n-terminal domain  followed by an alternation of two variable domains  and two more conserved sequence domains . in the conserved domains eight conserved cysteine residues are present that are involved in the formation of intra-molecular disulphide bounds, six in domain iii and two in domain v  <cit> . the six conserved cysteine residues of domain iii were present in all sequences whereas no conclusions could be drawn on the cysteine’s in domain v, because this domain was only partly sequenced. most γ-gliadins from ae. speltoides harboured a ninth conserved cysteine residue on position  <dig> of domain ii  <cit> . overall,  <dig> % of the clones contained an internal stop codon. the highest percentage of internal stop codons occurred in sequences from t. monococcum, in which a quarter  of all genomic γ-gliadin sequences had a stop codon in domain ii of the γ-gliadin sequence due to c to t transitions, generating an in frame truncation after the sequence motif qpqqfpqpqqpstop. 

the genetic variation among the genomic clones was studied in more detail using the neighbor-joining method, which resulted in four significantly different groups of genomic γ-gliadin sequences. two groups contained only sequences derived from ae. speltoides, another group consisted mainly of sequences derived from ae. tauschii together with a few sequences  from ae. speltoides, and the fourth group contained the t. monococcum sequences. the number of base substitutions per site among genomic γ-gliadin sequences depended on the species analyzed. for example, all sequences from ae. tauschii showed an average number of base substitutions of  <dig>  per site  whereas the level of genetic diversity of γ-gliadin sequences derived from ae. speltoides and t. monococcum was higher with respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  base substitutions per site.

γ-gliadin transcripts assigned to the a, b and d genome of bread wheat
to analyze the genetic diversity of actively expressed γ-gliadins in bread wheat , γ-gliadin transcripts  were extracted from the ncbi database. of the γ-gliadin transcripts thus obtained  <dig> were found to code for  <dig> different γ-gliadin protein isoforms, each represented by contigs with at least four transcripts at a homology level of at least 98%. the number of transcripts for each isoform ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  indicating large differences in relative expression rates and redundancy as a part of the differences can be related to different alleles coding for the same amino acid sequence .

subsequently, the  <dig> γ-gliadin isoforms of modern bread wheat were assigned to a genomic locus . to realize this, the consensus nucleotide sequences were studied for sequence distances by neighbor-joining analysis  together with the ancestrally related genomic γ-gliadin sequences from diploid triticum and aegilops species obtained in these studies, which are carrying the ab, s or d genome . in the resulting neighbor-joining tree  <dig> topology groups of γ-gliadins could be distinguished . the very center of the tree has low bootstrap values, due to the fact that several branches are joined here at almost the same point, but in varying topology. the different γ-gliadin transcript contigs of bread wheat showed up in seven topology groups . taking into account the number of transcripts represented by a consensus sequence, almost half  of the γ-gliadin transcriptome of bread wheat clustered with d-genomic sequences  of ae. tauschii and they were therefore assigned to the γ-gliadin locus gli-d <dig>  the other transcripts were assigned evenly to the other homoeologous loci: 25% to locus gli-a <dig> on basis of their clustering with ab-genome sequences derived from t. monococcum , and 25% to locus gli-b <dig> either by grouping with genomic sequences of ae. speltoides  or by blastn homology to ae. searsii .

cd epitopes of t.aestivum γ-gliadins in their natural context
in γ-gliadins several cd-immunogenic peptides have been identified  and an analysis on the basis of sequence identity showed that all groups of γ-gliadin transcripts of bread wheat contained cd epitope cores but with a different frequency . with a frequency of  <dig>  cd epitope-cores per transcript, the gli-d <dig> transcripts were coding for the highest number of γ-gliadin cd epitopes followed by the gli-a <dig> transcripts  and the gli-b <dig> transcripts . as the gli-d <dig> transcripts were also the highest expressed ones, most cd epitopes found in the γ-gliadin transcriptome originated from gli-d <dig> transcripts  followed by gli-a <dig>  and gli-b <dig>  .

by analyzing the cd epitopes in their natural context, distinct differences in genomic organization and epitope composition were observed among bread wheat γ-gliadin transcripts derived from the three γ-gliadin loci, gli-a <dig>  gli-d <dig> and gli-b <dig> . in many cases, repeat motifs contained overlapping cd epitopes. for instance, transcripts expressed from gli-d <dig> contained a repeat motif of  <dig> amino acids  that included three overlapping cd epitopes . because predicted tryptic cleavage sites were absent in these repeats they are most likely resistant to enzymatic degradation after ingestion. indeed, a sequence of  <dig> amino acids present in a part of the gli-d <dig> transcripts , 9% of the overall γ-gliadin transcriptome and harbouring four cd-epitope cores  has been reported to be resistant to proteolysis  <cit> . such cd epitope-rich repeat motifs were also present in transcripts expressed from gli-a <dig> and gli-b <dig>  despite the shorter repetitive domain of gli-b <dig> transcripts . the genomic structure of the c-terminal domain v is less complex and harbours a single cd epitope, dq2-γ-ii   . only two variants representing 9% of the transcripts displayed an amino acid change within the 9-mer core .

immunogenicity of dq2-γ-i epitope variants
the dq2-γ-i epitope  found in the variable domain ii of γ-gliadins is known as a major cd epitope derived from the γ-gliadin fraction of gluten  <cit> . in the present study thirteen natural variants of the dq2-γ-i epitope  were found among genomic sequences of t. monococcum subspec. monococcum , ae. speltoides var. speltoides , ae. tauschii , and t. aestivum transcripts  . according to the rules for enzymatic tg <dig> deamidation  <cit> , position q <dig> of the dq2-γ-i epitope core  is a moderate target for tg <dig> whereas the genetic variation at the c-terminal flanking positions + <dig> to + <dig> can influence the deamidation pattern of q <dig> to q <dig>  based on the natural variation in this flanking region several different deamidation profiles of the dq2-γ-i epitope core are evident . these variants were deamidated by tg <dig> and tested for their capacity to stimulate a dq2-γ-i epitope specific t-cell clone . the results show that variants in which q <dig> and q <dig> are deamidated stimulate the t-cell clone while variants in which q <dig> instead of q <dig> is deamidated or the f <dig> is replaced by a s do not display such activity. thus, natural variants of the dq2-γ-i epitope exist that influence the t-cell stimulatory capacity.

discussion
wheat gluten is the source of a large repertoire of t-cell epitopes involved in the pathogenesis of cd. it is clear that most patients react to epitopes derived from α-gliadins. however, there is increasing evidence that more t-cell epitopes from other gluten genes are involved in cd  <cit> . it was shown that next to α-gliadins also t-cell epitopes from γ-gliadins play a significant role in the development of cd  <cit> . tye-din et al.  <cit>  found that gluten specific polyclonal t-cells in the peripheral blood of cd patients were specific for the same set of gluten peptides after feeding the patients with the same cereal but after the patients ingested respectively wheat, barley and rye different t-cells, recognizing different sets of gluten peptides, were found. also, it was hypothesized that a t-cell response to gluten can be initiated against a relatively large number of peptides, and when the response evolves it focuses on the most immuno-dominant sequences  <cit> . so, there are some indications that the composition of different cereals and wheat varieties in the diet  <cit>  as well as the disease status  <cit>  may play a role in the defining the pattern of t cell reactivity towards different gluten peptides in a celiac patient.

using polyclonal, gliadin reactive t-cell lines, camarca et al.  <cit>  showed that t-cell reactivity towards the γ-gliadin derived peptides is more heterogeneous compared to the reaction to α-gliadin derived peptides; reaction to the latter was focused towards a few immunodominant peptides whereas a larger repertoire of different γ-gliadin derived peptides was found and patients were recognizing varying sets of peptides. they suggested that this less focussed behaviour of γ-gliadin peptides in celiac disease may reflect the high genetic diversity of γ-gliadins.

to obtain insight in cd epitopes derived from γ-gliadins we performed a detailed study of the presence and natural variation of cd epitopes derived from the γ-gliadin gluten fraction of bread wheat  which is an allo-hexaploid  carrying three homoeologous genomes a, b and d. this study included two datasets:   <dig> novel genomic γ-gliadin clones from the diploid wheat species t. monococcum, ae. speltoides and ae. tauschii. these diploid wheat species are carrying respectively genome ab, s and d which are ancestrally related to the three respective homoeologous genomes of bread wheat, a, b and d; and  γ-gliadin transcripts from bread wheat  derived from the public database . by similarity analysis the transcripts of bread wheat could be assigned to locus gli-a <dig>  gli-b <dig>  or gli-d <dig> . to reduce the complexity of the multigene γ-gliadin family, transcripts of bread wheat were analyzed . as such, the γ-gliadin transcriptome is a minimal estimate for the γ-gliadin variants in gluten of bread wheat. the γ-gliadin transcripts of bread wheat  encode for  <dig> different γ-gliadin protein isoforms of which ten represented full length γ-gliadins . this figure is in keeping with the 15– <dig> estimated γ-gliadin genes in hexaploid wheat estimated before  <cit> . half of the γ-gliadin transcripts from bread wheat grouped with ae. tauschii sequences  and were assigned to the γ-gliadin locus on chromosome 1d , indicating that the majority of the γ-gliadins are expressed from the d genome. the remainder of the transcripts were equally assigned to gli-a <dig>  and gli-b <dig> . similarly, for the α-gliadins it was found that the highest expression occurred from the d genome   <cit> .

with regard to cd epitope content, our analysis shows that γ-gliadins from bread wheat contain on average between  <dig> and  <dig> potential cd epitopes in the first variable domain . the 26-mer γ-gliadin peptide that harbours four distinct cd epitopes  <cit>  is only present in d-genome γ-gliadins. it is present in 9% of the γ-gliadin transcripts of bread wheat. thus, the γ-gliadins from all three genomes encode a large number of different immunogenic peptides which exceeds the number of identified immunogenic peptides in the α-gliadins. perhaps this is the basis of the observation that immuno-dominant responses to α-gliadin derived cd epitopes are generally found in patients, while responses to the γ-gliadins appear less consistent as was previously suggested by camarca et al.  <cit> . if patients make frequently t-cell responses to a limited number α-gliadin peptides but can respond to a large number of different γ-gliadin derived peptides, t-cells for some specific α-gliadin epitopes may prevail numerically but collectively γ-gliadin derived t-cell epitopes are probably similarly effective in causing cd.

the dq2-γ-i epitope  is regarded as a major cd epitope as it is frequently recognized by cd patients  <cit> . we observed a high level of natural genetic variation in the c-terminal flanking sequence of this cd epitope. according to the rules for deamidation by tg <dig>  <cit>  the variation in the c-terminal flanking sequences determines the deamidation pattern of this epitope core. among diploid and hexaploid wheat six variants of the 9-mer dq2-γ-i epitope core were evident with respect to variation in amino acid composition and deamidation pattern. testing of these dq2-γ-i variants for their capacity to trigger proliferation of dq2-γ-i specific t-cells confirmed that tg <dig> deamidation of glutamine  at position  <dig> is essential for t-cell stimulation, most likely because it is providing a negative charge which is essential for hla-dq <dig> binding. variant peptides that displayed a serine  at position  <dig> instead of an phenylalaninine  were found to have lost t-cell stimulatory capacity. moreover, the presence of a positively charged arginine  residue at position + <dig> diminished t-cell proliferation , most likely because it influenced the deamidation of q <dig> as previously observed by dørum et al.  <cit> . similarly, a tryptophan  at position + <dig> inhibited the t-cell response . thus, both substitutions within and outside the epitope core can influence the t-cell stimulatory properties of the dq2-γ-i epitope.

taken together, the γ-gliadins from all three wheat genomes appear to be a significant source of cd epitopes. similar to the α-gliadins, the highest number of potential immunogenic γ-gliadin peptides are encoded by the d genome of bread wheat which is thus the most critical genome with regard to cd toxicity. however, gluten derived from tetraploid wheat varieties lacking the d genome is not tolerated by cd patients as well, indicating that the mere elimination of the d genome is not sufficient for the generation of safe wheat. regarding the a-genome of wheat, there are indications for the existence of t. monococcum spp. with a level or type of gliadin that is unable to induce ifn-γ production and histologic damage as was observed for instance in duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with celiac disease  <cit> . so, the high level of genetic variation among wheat lines and the presence of genetic variation influencing the immunogenicity of the major cd epitopes may offer possibilities to generate wheat varieties with a reduced cd-immunogenicity, tailored to major cd epitopes . such varieties would help to reduce the presence of immunogenic cd epitopes in wheat flour and, while not safe for consumption by patients, might help to prevent the onset of cd in people that carry genetic risk factors  <cit> . however, introgression from the diploid to the hexaploid level is a time-consuming process, and consequently it will take many years before the product of such a synthetic hexaploidisation has been bred to sufficient agronomic quality. alternatively, one could screen a large number of existing varieties for differences in their toxicity for cd patients as the analysis of cd epitope regions in transcript sequences does provide an accurate and quick method for screening  <cit> . consequently, we are currently analyzing cd epitope regions in the gluten transcriptome of tetraploid wheat cultivars in a medium-throughput way by employing next-generation sequencing technology.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here for γ-gliadins form a significant contribution to the approach whereby the cd toxicity of wheat cultivars is quantified directly from protein-coding mrna sequences.
