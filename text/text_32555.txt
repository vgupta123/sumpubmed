BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori infect over 50 % of the world’s population, causing inflammatory gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the transition from h. pylori infection to gastric cancer remain unclear. h. pylori virulence factors including a cytotoxin-associated gene a , pathogenicity island , and vacuolating cytotoxin a   have been associated with severe h. pylori-related disease. specifically, h. pylori strains harboring an intact cag pai, encoding components of a type iv secretion system , are associated with a high risk of gastric cancer  <cit> . the t4ss, which is comprised of multiple transporters including the cage protein, is used to inject the immunodominant caga protein into the gastric epithelial cells. therefore, caga secretion depends on the expression of functional genes that encode the t4ss including cage. upon translocation into the eukaryotic host cell, caga is tyrosine phosphorylated by src family of kinases of the host, which lead to rearrangement of the host cell cytoskeleton termed the “hummingbird phenotype” and subsequent induction of cell scattering  <cit> . this phenomena is widely considered to be important in neoplastic transformation  <cit> . phosphorylated caga interacts with several major host cell signal-transduction pathways  <cit>  affecting cell morphology changes such as cell elongation and motility .

several intracellular signaling pathways are activated upon h. pylori infection of host gastric epithelial cells . specifically, caga interaction with shp <dig> phosphatase and the src family of kinases of the host cell are examples of how h. pylori is thought to hijack intracellular signaling pathways and potentially contribute to cancer development  <cit> . however, it is unlikely that signaling through these two pathways are exclusively associated with h. pylori pathogenesis. therefore, we wanted to characterize gastric epithelial cellular signaling responses following h. pylori infection, with a focus on pro-survival signals from pdk- <dig>  which has not been investigated in relation to h. pylori infection.

the best characterized cell survival signaling pathway is the pi 3-kinase/pdk-1/akt pathway. upon binding to activated tyrosine kinase receptors, phosphatidylinositol 3-oh-kinase  phosphorylates inositol phospholipids at the d- <dig> position of the inositol ring to generate phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  and phosphatidylinositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate . these lipids serve as membrane docking sites for many pleckstrin homology  domain-containing proteins, including pdk- <dig> and akt. phosphorylation of akt by pdk- <dig> activates the enzyme which phosphorylates a number of pro-survival proteins  <cit> .

pdk- <dig> is a multi-domain enzyme that contains an amino terminal kinase domain and a carboxy terminal ph domain separated by a small linker region. the enzyme is constitutively autophosphorylated at position ser  <dig> within the activation loop   <cit> . the primary function of pdk- <dig> appears to be that of a master regulatory protein kinase. pdk- <dig> phosphorylates the activation loop of agc serine/threonine kinase family members including protein kinase a , protein kinase b , protein kinase c  isoforms, p70s <dig> kinase, and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase resulting in catalytic competence . phosphorylation of the activation loop in agc protein kinases is thought to regulate access of substrates to the catalytic pocket. phosphorylation of the specific activation loop, serine/threonine is required for complete activation of these kinases and initiates specific signaling pathways that ultimately lead to many of the cellular responses associated with pi 3-k  <cit> . each kinase phosphorylated by pdk- <dig> therefore controls specific signaling pathways in time and space, placing pdk- <dig> at the apex of complex networks of intracellular signaling. the purpose of our study was therefore to determine whether pdk- <dig> plays a role in an in vitro h. pylori infection model with a human gastric epithelium cell line.

RESULTS
effect of h. pylori infection on pdk-1-activity in gastric epithelial cells
secretion of caga by h. pylori into human cells through the t4ss, has previously been demonstrated to hijack intracellular signaling systems involving the tyrosine kinase src, the tyrosine phosphatase shp- <dig>  and the adaptor protein grb <dig>  <cit> . we identified src and grb <dig> as pdk-1binding proteins through a proteomic screen , suggesting that pdk- <dig> activity may also be regulated in response to h. pylori infection. in initial studies, we wanted to determine whether incubation of h. pylori with a gastric epithelial cell line, ags could directly modulate signaling through pi 3-kinase. cells were infected for 24 h with five different h. pylori strains: ss <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  g <dig>  and sd <dig>  incubation of cells with h. pylori resulted in dephosphorylation of endogenous pdk- <dig> at ser  <dig> . the extent of dephosphorylation of pdk- <dig> was dependent upon the strain of h. pylori used, with the  <dig> strain being the most effective. it was possible that incubation of h. pylori with ags cells simply activated destruction of the pdk- <dig> protein, which would explain the loss of phosphorylation at serine  <dig>  to test this, we stripped the blot and re-probed for total pdk- <dig> protein . although we did see some proteolytic clipping of the pdk- <dig> protein, it largely remained intact, suggesting that h. pylori infection of ags cells resulted in dephosphorylation of pdk- <dig>  next, we measured the activity of endogenous pdk- <dig> in ags cells after incubation with the most effective h. pylori strain,  <dig> for 24 h. there was an 85 % decrease in ser  <dig> phosphorylation but no significant loss of pdk- <dig> protein .fig.  <dig> incubation of h. pylori with ags cells resulted in dephosphorylation of pdk- <dig> at ser  <dig>  a after infection with h. pylori strains ss <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  g <dig>  or sd <dig>  total ags protein was separated by sds-page followed by western blot to detect phopho ser  <dig> pdk- <dig>  and total pdk- <dig> protein . b

infection of ags cells with h. pylori results in altered phosphorylation of akt
phosphorylation of pdk- <dig> at ser  <dig> has been reported to be constitutive and necessary for phosphorylation of downstream substrates  <cit> . therefore, we wanted to determine whether incubation of ags with the h. pylori strain  <dig>  which robustly desphosphorylated ser  <dig> had an effect on akt. endogenous akt activity was measured in ags cells after incubation with h. pylori  <dig> for 24 h. incubation of cells with h. pylori resulted incomplete dephosphorylation of endogenous akt at ser  <dig> . interestingly, the akt protein was substantially and specifically degraded upon treatment with h. pylori , but a control protein, hsp <dig> was not affected. an 80 % decrease in ser  <dig> phosphorylation and 78 % decrease in akt protein were observed in cells incubated with h. pylori  <dig> .fig.  <dig>

mechanism of h. pylori dephosphorylation of pdk-1
to further explore the effect of h. pylori on pdk- <dig> activity, h. pylori strain  <dig> was used. endogenous pdk- <dig> ser  <dig> was robustly dephosphorylated upon incubation of ags cells with h. pylori  <dig>  but not in cells incubated with heat-inactivated h. pylori  <dig>  indicating that the h. pylori effect on pdk- <dig> was proteinaceous . to determine whether h. pylori directly secreted a protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates pdk- <dig>  purified recombinant his6-pdk- <dig> generated in baculovirus and constitutively phosphorylated at ser  <dig>  was incubated with whole h. pylori lysate for up to 1 h . at various times, his6-pdk- <dig> was removed from the incubation mixture and phosphorylation at ser  <dig> was verified by western blotting. no significant decrease in phosphorylation over the 1 h time course was observed, suggesting that pdk- <dig> is not the direct target of a secreted h. pylori protein.fig.  <dig> pdk- <dig> dephosphorylation in the presence of h. pylori is indirect. a representative western blot of phospho ser  <dig> pdk- <dig> and total pdk- <dig> protein following incubation of ags cells with live  or heat-killed h. pylori . total pdk- <dig> protein ran as two distinct species, one at the expected molecular weight  and at a faster migrating band  that was likely proteolytically cleaved. b incubation of whole h. pylori lysates with purified recombinant his6-pdk- <dig>  c incubation of ags cells with h. pylori in the absence or presence of src inhibitor, pp2



to determine whether signal transduction through src, a previously known h. pylori target in mammalian cells, was indirectly responsible for the dephosphorylation of pdk- <dig>  ags cells were next incubated with h. pylori, sd <dig>  we switched to sd <dig> because this strain previously yielded a strong hummingbird effect . therefore, this made it an efficient system to study the effects of src. ags cells were incubated with h. pylori sd <dig> for 24 h in the absence or presence of a src inhibitor, pp <dig> . as expected control cells incubated without h. pylori, had robust ser  <dig> phosphorylation, while cells incubated with h. pylori had decreased ser  <dig> phosphorylation. treatment with pp <dig> did not abrogate pdk- <dig> dephosphorylation. as a control that pp <dig> was working, the ags cells did not display the typical ‘hummingbird’ phenotype , which is known to be src dependent  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that the effect of h. pylori on pdk- <dig> ser  <dig> phosphorylation is not a src-mediated event.

the role of h. pylori type iv secretion system in pdk-1dephosphorylation
we next wanted to determine whether disruption of the t4ss machinery could alter the ability of h. pylori to modulate pdk- <dig> phosphorylation. minimal pdk- <dig> dephosphorylation observed in the ss <dig> strain , which is reported to have a non-functional t4ss  <cit>  suggests that a defect in the ability of h. pylori to deliver caga into the target cell might be involved in this effect. to test this, we used cage deficient h. pylori , which are unable to deliver caga protein into gastric epithelial cells  <cit> . triplicate samples of ags cells were infected with either wild type sd <dig> h. pylori strain or sd <dig> cage- for 24 h and the phosphorylation state of pdk- <dig> was monitored by western blot . almost complete dephosphorylation  of endogenous pdk- <dig> at ser  <dig> was observed in cells infected with the wild type sd <dig> h. pylori . in cells infected with sd <dig> cage-, residual pdk- <dig> phosphorylation was detected, but was also greatly reduced  suggesting that the t4ss plays a minor role in this process . reprobing with pdk- <dig> again showed that the protein remained largely intact, however, partial clipping of pdk- <dig> protein was observed in the presence of wild-type and cage deficient h. pylori . a western blot of hsp <dig> is shown in the bottom panel as a loading control . because only partial recovery of pdk- <dig> phosphorylation was observed in the presence of the cage- mutant suggests that dephosphorylation of pdk- <dig> is not entirely dependent on the h. pylori t4ss.fig.  <dig> 
h. pylori type iv secretion system is not required for complete pdk- <dig> dephosphorylation. a ags cell lysates were separated by sds-page followed by western blotting with antibodies to phospho ser  <dig> pdk- <dig> , total pdk- <dig> protein , or hsp <dig> . total pdk- <dig> protein ran as two distinct species, one at the expected molecular weight  and at a faster migrating band  that was likely proteolytically cleaved. b pdk- <dig> phosphorylation levels and total protein were quantified by normalizing to hsp <dig> levels and the amount of phosphorylation or total protein expressed as a ratio of control protein, i.e. /. data are representative of at least  <dig> different experiments and presented as a percent of control and indicate the relative amount of phosphorylation or protein remaining in the system



discussion
disruption of cell survival signaling pathways leads to inappropriate cellular proliferation, growth, and survival, which has been implicated in the genesis and/or progression of numerous human cancers, including melanoma, breast, colon, pancreatic, prostrate, ovarian, lung, and gastric cancers . host signaling pathways play significant roles in the pathogenesis of h. pylori disease. we used the gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, ags in the present study. the use of this cell line is invaluable and has been used as a standard model to study effects of h. pylori infection in gastric epithelial cells . however, there are limitations of using this cell line given that it is a gastric cancer cell line and as such does not always represent normal cell physiology. here, we showed that incubation of gastric epithelial cells with h. pylori for 24 h resulted in dephosphorylation of pdk- <dig>  this study is the first to describe conditions that result in dephosphorylation of the pdk- <dig> activation loop in response to a biological stimulus. pdk- <dig> is pivotal in cellular functions such as proliferation, cell cycle entry, cell survival, and cytoskeletal rearrangements  <cit> .

molecular events that initiate h. pylori-induced gastric cancer are not clearly known. altered cell signaling mechanisms that affect cell growth and differentiation of the gastric epithelium have been suggested to be the underlying cause of gastric cancer  <cit> . our data suggest that an uncharacterized h. pylori protein is required for an intracellular mammalian phosphatase to dephosphorylate pdk- <dig>  evidence for this comes from experiments with heat-killed h. pylori that do not alter the phosphorylation state of pdk- <dig>  and from experiments where purified recombinant his6-pdk- <dig> was not dephosphorylated upon incubation with h. pylori lysates . further, use of the src kinase inhibitor pp <dig> indicated that dephosphorylation of pdk- <dig> was independent of src activity . together, these results suggest that a host factor mediates pdk- <dig> dephosphorylation in response to infection with h. pylori.

we also found that h. pylori dephosphorylation altered the phosphorylation status and protein stability of the pdk- <dig> substrate, akt. our observation of h. pylori dephosphorylation of akt is not in disagreement with previously published studies that show h. pylori activate akt  <cit> . this is primarily due to the difference is the time point selected for infection. indeed, using gastric epithelial cells nagy et al.  <cit>  demonstrated in a very elegant study that h. pylori induction of akt activation was dependent on time. the highest activation was at 2 h post infection with h. pylori and by 24 h, the time used in these studies, induction of akt activation was very low  <cit> . all these studies to date, including our present study, report that h. pylori infection regulates akt activity.

severity and progression of h. pylori disease has been linked to h. pylori virulence factors  <cit> . we showed dephosphorylation of pdk- <dig> occurred in the presence of h. pylori lacking the virulence factor, cage. although there was a statistically significant difference in the amount of phosphate detected at ser  <dig> in pdk- <dig> between cells incubated with wild type sd <dig> and sd <dig> cage- mutant , a majority  of phosphate was removed under both conditions. this suggests that an intact t4ss played only a limited role in this process.

h. pylori dephosphorylation of pdk- <dig> and subsequent dephosphorylation of its substrates, including akt, which regulates cell survival may therefore result in an imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis. the process of h. pylori-related apoptosis in involvement of gastric cancer remains controversial. while there is a consensus that increased cell proliferation favors tumorigenesis, the process that leads to the increased cell proliferation is contradictory. some studies using animal models have reported induction of apoptosis by h. pylori during the early stages of infection followed later by increased cell proliferation, which correlates well with what has been observed in humans infected with h. pylori  <cit> . overall, implications from our present study agree with the observation that there is an initial induction of apoptosis during the early infection with h. pylori, which leads to compensatory heightened cell proliferation associated with the development of gastric cancer. the assumption that reduced pdk- <dig> phosphorylation is associated with h. pylori-induced apoptosis could be proven during the course of h. pylori infection. hence, further investigation is required to better understand how pdk- <dig> activity changes during helicobacter disease. nonetheless, our findings clearly demonstrate that h. pylori regulates pdk- <dig> phosphorylation at the activation loop serine, which is key for enzyme function. although we cannot draw direct conclusions that pdk- <dig> dephosphorylation plays a role in h. pylori-induced gastric cancer, we show that incubation with h. pylori resulted in dephosphorylates pdk- <dig> protein. pdk- <dig> dephosphorylation is associated with induction of apoptosis . further, apoptosis affects the rate of new cell proliferation thereby disrupting the balance between these cellular events, a process implicated in h. pylori-associated carcinogenesis . our data provide information on cellular responses that mediate h. pylori infection in gastric epithelial cells.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides evidence that h. pylori dephosphorylates pdk- <dig>  which alters phosphorylation and stability of the anti-apoptotic pdk- <dig> substrate, akt. we show that activation loop phosphorylation of pdk- <dig>  which plays a central role in cell survival signaling pathways, is dysregulated in response to h. pylori infection. this dysregulation could modify signaling responses of the host including altered rates of apoptosis and cell proliferation, which may contribute to h. pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis. imbalance between apoptosis and cell proliferation in gastric mucosal epithelia has been implicated in h. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis . despite testing for logical h. pylori and host proteins, the host protein directly involved in pdk- <dig> dephosphorylation remains unknown. our present results allow us to propose that dephosphorylation of host pdk- <dig> may represent one of the important mechanisms by which h. pylori induces the development of gastric cancer.
