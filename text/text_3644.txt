BACKGROUND
the genus camellia is composed of over  <dig> taxa  <cit> , of which c. sinensis  o. kuntze is often commercially used as a source of the beverage tea. c. taliensis, commonly described as “wild” tea plant by the local people of its growing areas, is one of the most important wild relatives of the cultivated tea, and they together belong to the section thea. they both are monoecious, insect-pollinated, and outcrossing species, but differ from each other primarily in the number of locules and the sizes of flowers and leaves. the number of locules per ovary is five in c. taliensis, while three for c. sinensis. the c. sinensis has high cross-compatibility with most of its allied species in the genus camellia, especially with the c. taliensis  <cit> . because of its fascinated aftertaste and close relationship with the cultivated tea, c. taliensis has also been consumed instead of common tea by local people in some regions of asia, particularly in yunnan province of china  <cit> . c. taliensis usually grows in the mountainous evergreen broad-leaved forests at altitudes from  <dig>  to  <dig>  m, and is mainly distributed in southwestern yunnan of china as well as adjacent regions including northern myanmar and thailand. notably, the c. taliensis population was also found on ‘mengku’ snow mountain, yunnan, china, at the altitude of  <dig>  m, implying an extremely strong stress resistance in c. taliensis  <cit> . thus, it may harbor abundant gene resources that have great potential to enhance genetic improvement of cultivated tea in the future. the transcriptome of c. sinensis has been sequenced  <cit> , and many tea quality or cold tolerance-related genes have been identified in this species. however, limited genomic resources are available for c. taliensis, probably due to its large genome size of around  <dig> gb  <cit> . until now, there are only  <dig> protein sequences,  <dig> nucleotide sequences and  <dig> gene sequences of c. taliensis in genbank database . they are apparently insufficient for mining functional genes encoding enzymes associated with important secondary metabolic pathways within c. taliensis and the genetically improving the flavor and yield of cultivated tea tree.

transcriptome sequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies is a fast and cost-effective approach to generate genome-scale sequence resources  <cit> , and thus has increasingly been employed in more and more plants. particularly for those lacking a sequenced reference genome or non-model species, it provides an efficient and prior way to investigate patterns of gene expression, discover novel genes, and obtain a large number of genetic markers. currently, three next-generation sequencing  platforms, including roche  <dig>  illumina genome analyzer and life technologies solid, are available and they can generate massive sequence reads at an extraordinary depth. in terms of the sensitivity, accuracy and throughput, these platforms have different advantages and limitations. among them, illumina sequencing technology, which generates large-scale reads  with a high sequencing coverage at lower costs, has extensively been used for de novo transcriptome studies  <cit> .

in this study, we present the first transcriptome of c. taliensis using the next-generation sequencing platform illumina. the large est dataset will remarkably enlarge genomic resources of c. taliensis available in the public database. the obtained data have led to the identification of a number of candidate genes and functional elements determining major metabolic pathways associated with tea-quality and stress resistance that are of great importance to enhance efforts for genetic improvement of the cultivated tea tree.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly of the c. taliensis transcriptome
to comprehensively construct the complete transcriptome of c. taliensis, four tissues representing various development stages, including tender shoots, young leaves, flower buds and flowers, were harvested for rna isolation. following the illumina manufacturer’s instructions , the shotgun libraries were constructed and used for sequencing with the illumina high-seq  <dig> platform. in total, ~ <dig>  million paired-end reads with a read length of 100 bp were generated . after quality checks, trimming of adapter, and size selection, de novo assembly was performed using trinity  <cit>  and  <dig>  transcripts were reconstructed. to reduce redundancy and potential assembly errors, we clustered  <dig>  transcripts into  <dig>  unigenes using cd-hit  <cit> , and then filtered out those likely artifact transcripts with its fpkm  values less than  <dig>  as a result, a final high-quality dataset of  <dig>  transcripts longer than 200 bp with an average length of 685 bp and an n <dig> of 995 bp was obtained . the size distribution for them is shown in figure 1a. to evaluate the quality of the assembly, we randomly selected six transcripts to design primer pairs for rt-pcr amplifications. in this experiment,  <dig> out of  <dig> primer pairs experimentally resulted in bands of the expected sizes, and the identity of all five pcr products were confirmed by sanger sequencing . in addition, we analyzed the sequencing bias via detecting random distribution of reads in orf from the assembled transcripts . although the 3’ ends of all orfs contained relatively fewer numbers of reads, other positions of all orfs showed greater numbers and more even distribution. these experimental validation and data analyses suggest that the quality of our dataset is comparable to similar reports in other non-model plant species  <cit> .table  <dig>

functional annotation of c. taliensis transcriptome
to predict and analyze the function of the  <dig>  transcripts, all transcripts sequences were first aligned against those sequences in the ncbi non-redundant  protein database using blastx. a total of  <dig>  significant blast top hits were returned with a cut-off e-value of 1e- <dig> . as reported in the previous study  <cit> , the length of transcript sequences is crucial in determining the efficiency of blast searches. our results showed that 98% of the matching efficiency was observed for sequences longer than  <dig>  bp, whereas the matching efficiency decreased to about 68% for those ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and to 40% for sequences between  <dig> to 500 bp . the similarity distribution of the top hits in the nr database displayed that  <dig> % of the mapped sequences had similarities higher than 80%, while  <dig> % of the hits had similarities ranging from 20% to 80% . the e-value distribution had a comparable pattern with  <dig> % of the mapped sequences with high homologies , whereas  <dig> % of the homologous sequences ranged between 1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig> . for species distribution,  <dig> % of the distinct sequences had the top matches  trained with sequences from the vitis vinifera, followed by the arabidopsis thaliana , theobroma cacao , solanum lycopersicum  and prunus persica  .figure  <dig> characteristics of the homology search of unigenes against the nr database.  effects of query sequence length on percentage of significant matches. the cut-off value was set at  <dig> e- <dig>  the proportion of sequences with matches in the nr database at ncbi is greater among the longer assembled sequences.  similarity distribution of the best blast hits for each unigene.  e-value distribution of the top blast hits for each unigene.  species distribution is shown as the percentage of the total homologous sequences.



to further obtain detailed descriptions and improve the annotations of the c. taliensis transcriptome, another three high-annotate protein databases, including uniref <dig>  tair <dig> and kog, were also used to perform additional blast alignments with blastx . in the case of uniref <dig>  a total of  <dig>  matches  were obtained . compared against the tair <dig>  containing a complete reference genome and comprehensively annotated gene sequences for the model plant arabidopsis thaliana, a total of  <dig>   obtained significant blast matches . blast searches against the kog databases revealed that  <dig>   had the best hit and were assigned to  <dig> functional categories when e-value was less than or equal to 1e− <dig>  among the  <dig> kog categories, the cluster for “general function prediction” represents the largest group , followed by “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones”  and “signal transduction mechanisms” . the following categories, including “nuclear structure” , “extracellular structures”  and “cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis” , were the smallest groups . notably, the category of secondary metabolism made up  <dig> %  in the annotated transcripts due to the abundance of secondary metabolites in c. taliensis.

considering that the information of conserved domains within a gene was indicative of deducing genes’ function, we performed the annotation of potential domains inside the assembled transcripts. to facilitate this procedure, the open reading frame  for each transcript was first extracted using a set of programs included in the trinity package , and then all the transcripts with predicted orfs were searched against the pfam database using profile hidden markov model methods. overall, a total of  <dig>  transcripts were categorized into  <dig>  domains/families. figure 3a shows the size distribution of each domains/families, suggesting that most domains were found to contain a small number of transcripts, with a small proportion seeming more frequently. based on the frequency of the occurrence of transcripts contained in each pfam domain, we ranked the pfam domains/families and listed the top ten abundant domains/families in figure 3b, with hit results similar to the previous study  <cit> . among these domains/families, “protein kinase domain” and its subclass “protein tyrosine kinase” are known to regulate the majority of cellular pathways, proteins with “leucine-rich repeats” domain are recognized to be frequently involved in the formation of protein–protein interactions, and “ppr repeat” has been reported to be a large protein family in plants with versatile functions  <cit> . other protein families, such as “rna recognition motif”, “wd domain, g-beta repeat”, and “cytochrome p450”, which have some basic functions in plants, were also found in the top ten of the list. taken together,  <dig>  transcripts got the best hits with known proteins in at least one of the five databases, and  <dig>  transcripts exhibited the similarity to proteins in all of the five databases .figure  <dig> protein families in c. taliensis transcriptome.  the number of pfam domains/families versus the occurrence of c. taliensis transcripts contained in each domain/family.  the  <dig> most abundant protein families in c. taliensis.




go classification and kegg pathway mapping
to functionally classify the c. taliensis transcripts, gene ontology  terms and enzyme commission  numbers were assigned to each transcript using blast2go based on the best blastx hit from the nr database. of the  <dig>  transcripts with nr annotation, a total of  <dig>  transcripts were assigned to  <dig>  go terms. the distribution of go terms for molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components is shown in additional file  <dig>  for the biological process classification, genes involved in the “cellular process”  and “metabolic process”  were highly represented. for the molecular function classification, “catalytic functions”  was the most enriched go term, followed by “binding functions” . for the cellular component, the major categories were “cell” , “cell part”  and “organelle” . as described previously  <cit> , the enzyme commission number  is a numerical classification scheme for enzymes. of the  <dig>  sequences annotated with go terms,  <dig>  sequences were assigned with ec numbers . to fully identify the ec numbers and biological pathways that are active in c. taliensis, all the assembled sequences were again assigned with kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  orthology  identifiers using kegg automatic annotation server  with the single-directional best hit information method, and subsequently mapped to pathways and enzymes using the kegg api. as a result, we assigned  <dig>  sequences to  <dig> kegg pathways . the pathways with the most representation by the unique sequences were ribosome ; carbon metabolism  and oxidative phosphorylation . these annotations will undoubtedly provide valuable resources for investigating specific processes, functions and pathways during the tea development.

identification of genes for secondary metabolic pathways involved in tea quality and comparative analysis with c. sinensis
the quality of tea, including color, smells and flavor, is a sum of all active components in tea. therein, the most important components involved in taste and nutritional values are some secondary metabolites, such as flavonoid, amino acids, and alkaloids  <cit> . to reconstruct these vital secondary metabolic pathways in c. taliensis and provide valuable gene resources for the genetic improvement of cultivated tea trees, we performed the pathway analysis for the biosynthesis of three important secondary metabolites, including catechins, theanine and caffeine. as a result, most of the genes encoding the enzymes involved in these three metabolic pathways were detected in this study . relatively low homology was observed for some key genes, such as tcs, fnsii and f4’st, when compared with previously cloned genes in c. sinensis. these differences may lead to the molecular evolutionary alterations between cultivated tea and c. taliensis.figure  <dig> unigenes involved in the three metabolic pathways. the number in parenthesis means the number of unigenes identified in c. taliensis, and the color bar represents the identity and coverage of the best unigene  detected in c. taliensis against its corresponding gene in c. sinensis. a) flavonoids biosynthesis pathway. b) theanine biosynthesis pathway. c) caffeine biosynthesis pathway.



flavonoid biosynthesis pathway
flavonoids are the major secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities in tea tree. they have myriad types, and play an important role in determining the quality of tea, especially the catechins, which are the most representative component of flavonoids constituting more than 70-80% of all polyphenol contents  <cit> . based on the de novo assembly and functional annotation of the c. taliensis transcriptome, we identified the transcripts encoding the key enzymes involved in flavonoid pathway of c. taliensis . our results showed that most of transcripts identified had multiple copies. for example, numbers of the transcripts from genes encoding cinnamate 4-hydroxylase , chalcone isomerase , and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

theanine biosynthesis pathway
theanine  is the most abundant free amino acid and a kind of unique component in tea tree  <cit> . it has several positive effects, such as making people relaxed  <cit> , improving memory and attention  <cit>  and antagonizing with caffeine  <cit> . previous studies suggest that theanine is synthesized from glutamic acid and ethylamine derived from decarboxylation of alanine by theanine synthetase , which is highly homologous to glutamine synthetase   <cit> . to form the glutamate and ethylamine, a number of additional enzymes are involved: gs, glutamate synthase , glutamate dehydrogenase , alanine transaminase , and alanine decarboxylase . in the annotated transcriptome, most of the genes involved in this pathway were detected except for aida, which is specific in tea tree and never reported in other plants. here we totally identified four transcripts for s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase , which share similar domains with aida. a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts, having similarities with gs, gagot-fe, gdh, alt and ts, respectively, were also found in the transcriptome .

caffeine biosynthesis pathway
caffeine  is another representative secondary metabolites derived from purine alkaloid in plant  <cit> . it was probably absorbed as a defense element during plant evolution  <cit> . with both protective and deleterious effects, caffeine has been prominent in research communities for decades and still aroused great interest of world-wide scientists for the industrialization of caffeine biosynthesis and a low-caffeine tea. although caffeine biosynthesis pathway has been widely known in c. sinensis, however, the existing knowledge on the pathways and enzymes involved in caffeine biosynthesis in other camellia species, such as c. taliensis, is still limited. as reported previously  <cit> , the precursor for caffeine biosynthesis is xanthosine, which is catalyzed by three methylations and one nucleosidase reaction to form the caffeine: xanthosine → 7-methylxanthosine → 7-methylxanthine → theobromine → caffeine. the xanthosine is formed from imp by inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase   <cit> . based on the transcriptome annotation, in this study, we identified most of the genes encoding enzymes involved in caffeine biosynthesis pathway. figure 5c shows the caffeine biosynthesis pathway reconstructed based on the determined transcripts, and additional file  <dig> lists all the transcripts identified above.

to assess sequence homology between c. taliensis and c. sinensis,  <dig> previously cloned genes that are related to the important secondary metabolic pathways in c. sinensis , were downloaded and aligned against the corresponding transcripts identified in the c. taliensis transcriptome using blastall package. the detailed information including gene names, alignments and genbank accession numbers is given in additional file  <dig>  our results showed that almost all identified transcripts were full-length -cdna or approximately fl-cdna, such as f3’5’h, impdh, and f3h . to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to obtain so large number of high-quality fl-cdna sequences in the genus camellia, which will greatly contribute to the in vitro synthesis of important secondary metabolites for tea industry. comparisons with the genes previously cloned in c. sinensis revealed noteworthy variations between these two species. for example, in flavonoids biosynthesis pathway, some genes, such as pal and lcr, were fairly conserved with high identities of more than 90%, while great sequence differences were found in fnsii and f4’st with identities lower than 38% and 65%,respectively. relatively high sequence similarity  was found in unigenes related to theanine biosynthesis. in caffeine biosynthesis pathway, all genes associated with the reactions before the synthesis of xanthosine were remarkably conserved, and the utmost dissimilarity was observed in unigenes encoding tcs. although one unigene of tcs, ctatrans <dig>  had a high identity of 99%, however, the coverage of this transcript was only  <dig> %. all these variations were further confirmed by re-mapping the sequencing reads to the assembled transcripts. at the transcriptome level, the gene variations detected above are probably the reasons for the content differences of important phytochemical components between c. taliensis and c. sinensis  <cit> .

gene expression profiling among different developmental stages
to examine the expression pattern of genes encoding enzymes involved in important secondary metabolic pathways at different developmental stages, we calculated the fpkm values for the fourteen flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes , the six theanine biosynthesis involved genes  and the four caffeine biosynthesis-related genes  . we observed that most of these genes associated with flavonoids biosynthesis pathway exhibited a similar expression pattern with higher levels in tender shoots but slightly decreased in young leaves , indicating that the flavonoid biosynthesis actively occurs in tender shoots. these observations are consistent with previous results obtained in c. sinensis  <cit> . it is worth noting that some genes, such as pal, ans, anr and lcr, exhibit relatively higher expression levels in either flowers or flower buds, reinforcing previous studies suggesting that flavonoid biosynthesis may be involved in flower coloration  <cit> .figure  <dig> expression pattern of candidate genes involved in different biosynthesis pathways. a) flavonoids biosynthesis pathway. b) theanine biosynthesis pathway. c) caffeine biosynthesis pathway. .



genes involved in theanine biosynthesis can be mainly divided into two types: glutamic acid synthesis related  and ethylamine synthesis related . expression analysis revealed that genes related to glutamic acid synthesis were highly expressed in young leaves except for gdh . by contrast, genes involved in ethylamine synthesis, including adc and samdc, showed the highest level of expression in flowers . a similar pattern was also observed in ts. previous studies confirmed that theanine was primarily synthesized in the root of tea trees, and then transformed into the tender shoots through the xylem  <cit> . combined with the former discovery that tea flower has a comparable concentration of theaine  <cit> , it is likely that a larger portion of theanine in tea flower may be synthesized in situ compared with other tissues.

our analyses of expression levels of genes encoding sams, ampda, impdh and tcs in caffeine biosynthesis showed that all these studied genes were expressed in a constitutive manner and detected with a relatively high expression level in vegetative organ . this observation suggests that caffeine biosynthesis vigorously act in tender shoots and young leaves, consistent to an earlier study  <cit> . it is worth mentioning that another expression peak of all genes was found in flower tissues, especially for tcs, of which the expression level is much higher than that in other tissues. together with the former discovery in c. sinensis  <cit> , our results further demonstrate that the flower is probably another important place for the caffeine biosynthesis.

validation of unigenes and gene expression profiling using rt-qpcr
in order to experimentally validate the reliability of unigenes obtained from the assembled transcriptome and profiling of gene expression obtained by rna-seq data, a total of  <dig> key unigenes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids, theanine and caffeine were selected for rt-qpcrs . the detailed results of the selected unigenes, ids and primer pairs used in this study are shown in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig> quantitative rt-qpcr validations. a total of  <dig> genes were selected for the quantitative rt-qpcr experiments. of them, pal, dfr, anr, fls, lcr, fns and chsi were for flavonoids biosynthesis pathway, gogat, samdc and ts belong to theanine biosynthesis pathway, and sams, impdh and tcs were from caffeine biosynthesis pathway.



rt-pcr amplification was performed to confirm the suitability of the used primer pairs, showing that all  <dig> selected unigenes were successfully amplified with single bands with the expected sizes . the results suggest that the assembled transcripts are reliable and the designed primer pairs are suitable for the subsequent expression experiments. based on the delta-delta ct  method, relative expression levels of the selected unigenes were calculated and compared among the four different tissues. all the expression patterns of these genes detected by rt-qpcr were mainly consistent with those from rna-seq data except for sams. this gene exhibited the highest expression level in the flower detected by rt-qpcr, while the highest expression level was observed in young leaves with the rna-seq data . overall, rt-qpcr experiments confirmed that the unigenes obtained from the assembled transcriptome are trustworthy and gene expression profiles from rna-seq data should be believable.

comparative analysis of stress-resistance related genes in c. taliensis and c. sinensis
similar to other economic crops, tea yields are often affected by biotic and abiotic stresses, such as the pathogens exobasidium vexans masse, phyllosticta gemmiphliae chen et hu, and gloeosporium theae-sinensis miyake, or harsh environmental conditions. to adapt the rapidly changing environments, plants have developed a variety of defense mechanisms during the process of evolution, including signaling molecules  <cit> , genes encoding transcription factors  <cit>  and relative gene family expansion  <cit> . to date, c. taliensis has become seriously endangered due to an overexploitation driven by economic incentives. to better conserve and make good use of germplasm resources of this wild tea species, we identified and characterized the putative stress resistance-related genes in both the published transcriptome of c. sinensis and sequences of c. taliensis assembled in this study. our goal is to have a first glimpse at the variation of resistance genes among these two species using rna-seq data and provide some references and gene resources for the tea tree study in the future.

identification of transcription factors in c. taliensis
transcription factors  are kinds of dna-binding proteins that can activate or repress gene expression through specific interactions with cis-acting elements in promoters of eukaryotic genes  <cit> . the activation of a large number of stress-related genes is mediated by specific tfs  <cit> . over the past decades, many tfs related to stress responses have been identified from different plants  <cit> , but little has been known in tea tree so far. to identify putative genes that could be involved in freezing tolerance, we searched for members of the tfs families potentially involved in cold resistance, including ap <dig>  bzip, nac, bhlh, wybr, erf, wrky, myb, hsf and rav, in both c. taliensis and c. sinensis using a domain-based pipeline . as a result, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> members were detected in c. taliensis and c. sinensis, respectively . of them, rav represents the smallest group with only one and two members in c. taliensis and c. sinensis, respectively. while bhlh is the most preponderance class with  <dig> and  <dig> members were identified in c. taliensis and c. sinensis. comparative analysis showed that some tf family sizes of c. sinensis are slightly larger than those in c. taliensis, but others are in opposite . for example, ap <dig>  nac and wrky respectively have  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> copies in c. sinensis, while  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> members in c. taliensis. interestingly, the number of erf gene family in c. taliensis is  <dig>  which is much larger than those in c. sinensis .figure  <dig> comparative analysis of stress resistance related genes between c. taliensis and c. sinensis transcriptome.

lea gene family
late embryogenesis abundant protein  was firstly identified in cotton  <cit> . after that, it was successively discovered in a variety of plants  <cit> . lea proteins have been found to be highly hydrophilic with a high ratio of glycine or other small amino acids  <cit> , which functions extreme desiccation tolerance and stress resistance in plants, especially for cold tolerance. previous studies have demonstrated the important roles of lea proteins in protecting plants from abiotic stress, for example, the over-expression of wheat lea  increased the freezing tolerance in strawberry leaves  <cit> . to further identify putative genes that could be involved in cold tolerance in c. taliensis and c. sinensis, we detected the lea members in these two species based on the searches of the conserved lea domains. comparative analysis showed that the total number of lea genes in c. taliensis was much larger than that in c. sinensis . except for subfamily lea <dig>  lea <dig> and lea <dig>  the size of which are approximately equal between these two species, the other classes of lea family are much abundant in c. taliensis. notably, we found that lea <dig> was the most abundant class in tea tree with  <dig> and  <dig> members in c. taliensis and c. sinensis, respectively. this copy number variation of lea members between these two species may lead to the high altitude and low temperature niche adaptation in c. taliensis.

nbs-lrr related transcripts
the majority of plant disease resistance genes are sequences encoding proteins with a nucleotide-binding site and c-terminal leucine-rich repeat   <cit> . they have been shown to be involved in plant resistance to biotic stresses, such as fungus, bacteria, viruses and nematodes  <cit> , and have been cloned in several plants. traditionally, based on the presence or absence of a toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain at the n-terminus, this class can be divided into two subgroups, tir-nbs and non-tir-nbs proteins  <cit> . a coiled-coil  motif may also exist in the n-terminal region of most of the members without tir domain  <cit> . in this study, based on the hmmsearch,  <dig> and  <dig> genes encoding nbs domains were detected in c. taliensis and c. sinensis, respectively . to classify these nbs-encoding genes, all the members were evaluated for cc or tir domains in n terminus as well as lrrs in c terminus. result showed that  <dig> and  <dig> genes had only nbs domain, representing the most abundant class in tea tree, and accounted for 51% and 85% in c. taliensis and c. sinensis, respectively. except for the solo-nbs domain containing transcripts, four and one genes were predicted to encode n-terminal tir domains in c. taliensis and c. sinensis, respectively. wherein, one of these genes in c. taliensis has a complete lrr domain.  <dig> of  <dig> genes in c. taliensis and  <dig> of  <dig> genes in c. sinensis were identified with cc motif, of which  <dig> and  <dig> were detected without the lrr domain, respectively. additionally,  <dig> and  <dig> genes only had nbs-lrr domains in c. taliensis and c. sinensis. overall, apart from the class with only nbs domain, the amount of other types of r genes is much fewer in cultivated tea tree. this probably derived from the short length of transcripts in c. sinensis  <cit> .table  <dig>
