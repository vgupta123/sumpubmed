BACKGROUND
the common marmoset monkey , a small non-endangered new world primate native to eastern brazil, is becoming increasingly used as a non-human primate model in biomedical research, drug development and safety assessment. not only their close genetic, physiological and metabolic similarity to humans but also several unique physiological differences between old world and new world primates, underlie its widespread use as an animal model in studies involving aspects of infectious disease, stem cell research, neural and cognitive sciences, toxicology and drug development and reproductive biology. moreover, its availability, size, ease of breeding in laboratory conditions and its clear advantages over other non-human primates in terms of animal welfare, costs and practicality contribute to its popularity as an attractive alternative to other non-human primate species such as the rhesus macaque  <cit> . in contrast to the growing interest for the marmoset as an animal model, the molecular tools for genetic analysis are extremely limited.

although a marmoset genome project was initiated in  <dig> and is ongoing  <cit> , today there are still only very few mrna sequences of marmoset origin available in the public domain. to allow gene expression profiling of different marmoset organs and delineation of complex biological pathways, we have developed a marmoset-specific dna microarray, called eumama  starting from large scale est sequencing of marmoset transcripts to generate the required sequence information.

the marmoset array is an initiative within a european commission-funded consortium aimed at investigating the long term effects of prenatal exposure to glucocorticoids  <cit>   in a non-human primate model. the working hypothesis of this consortium is that excessive foetal exposure to glucocorticoid hormones  exerts organisational effects on the development of a variety of target tissues resulting in altered gene expression patterns that may persist throughout life. these 'programming' effects are believed to shape vulnerability to a variety of adult diseases including heart disease, diabetes, kidney failure and brain disorders  <cit> . since the effects of prenatal gc exposure are so widespread, we chose to initially focus on the effects in the brain by using hippocampal rna as a source to generate est sequences on the marmoset array. the hippocampus is a brain structure involved in learning and memory processes, mood and regulation of the stress response via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. gcs are essential for normal hippocampal development, exerting a wide spectrum of effects, resulting in altered structural plasticity and function  <cit> . therefore, the obvious applicability of the marmoset microarray is to study neuronal gene expression. however, we show here that the microarray can also be used to generate expression profiles in a wide variety of non-neuronal marmoset tissues.

besides the marmoset microarray we have generated  <dig> ests derived from marmoset hippocampus, which have been functionally annotated and submitted to genbank . these new tools will facilitate molecular genetic research into this non-human primate animal model.

RESULTS
mapping, annotation and submission of sequences to genbank
a total of  <dig> high quality sequences  were selected for annotation  <cit> . after removal of redundant sequences,  <dig> high quality unique 3' est sequences remained which were trimmed to an average length of  <dig> bases. annotation of the est dataset to the refseq dataset of human genes allowed unambiguous assignment of gene names for  <dig> sequences. a remaining  <dig> sequences could also be confidently assigned with gene names by mapping to the human genome or cross-species mapping. of these  <dig>  sequences assigned with a gene name,  <dig>  sequences could also be annotated with an open reading frame  . these orf-containing sequences were submitted to genbank . the majority of the remaining  <dig> sequences without an assigned gene name consisted of a group of  <dig>  which could not be matched to a known mrna but were mappable on the genome and  <dig>  which could not mapped to refseq genes nor to a mammalian genome . the latter  <dig> genes most likely represent novel genes that may be uniquely expressed in the marmoset hippocampus. all  <dig>  est sequences without an orf were submitted to dbest .

gene selection and construction of the marmoset microarray
a subset of  <dig> of the annotated 3'ests were selected by the eupeah consortium to be represented on the marmoset array, supplemented with  <dig> marmoset cdna sequences available in genbank. we selected the genechip® customexpress® array program of affymetrix for design and manufacturing of the marmoset array . this choice was based on the previous experience of affymetrix working with consortia to design specific dedicated arrays but also due to the advantages of standardisation of the hybridisation and data extraction procedure. the sequence data was submitted to the affymetrix chip design group and used to design  <dig> perfect match and mismatch 25-mer oligonucleotides per sequence according to the standard algorithms used in affymetrix commercially available catalogue arrays. the most optimal probes sets per sequence were selected for in situ synthesis on the marmoset array. each unique transcript was represented by a single probe set, except for  <dig> transcripts where there was no obvious ideal probe set. in these  <dig> cases  <dig> different probes sets were synthesized in situ representing different nucleotides of the same transcript. as controls the standard affymetrix control set present on all affymetrix expression arrays, consisting of quality control and alignment controls as well as target preparation and hybridisation controls, was tiled. since we did not have a set of full-length housekeeping control genes of the marmoset for assessment of sample quality, scaling and/or normalization of arrays, the species-specific control sets of rhesus monkey and human were tiled. in addition, both 5' and 3' sequences of  <dig> marmoset genes abundantly expressed in hippocampus were included as controls for assessing the overall labeling efficiency and quality of biotin-labeled target sample .

the final design of the marmoset microarray consisted of a total of  <dig> probe sets of which  <dig> control probe sets and  <dig> probe sets representing  <dig> different marmoset transcripts. a total of  <dig> probe sets were derived from  <dig> different sequences already available in genbank, while the remaining  <dig> probe sets were derived from  <dig> of our proprietary sequences obtained by sequencing marmoset ests. the majority  of these  <dig> ests were derived from the set of  <dig> ests that have been submitted to genbank . another  <dig> ests had already been selected for representation on the marmoset array based on our initial annotation, but did not pass the criteria we applied for genbank submission.

the majority of the ests represented on the marmoset array assigned with a gene symbol  could be classified according to gene ontology based on biological function  or molecular process , representing a wide variety of different functional classes .

expression profiling of hippocampus and several non-neuronal tissues
detection rates, indicated by present calls, on rna derived from hippocampus and cortex were high with 85% present calls. even though the sequences represented on the marmoset genechip are of hippocampal origin, detection rates on rna derived from various peripheral tissues, including kidney, liver, adipose tissue, aorta, skeletal muscle, ovary and testis, were also high. all peripheral tissues tested so far displayed approximately 70% present calls, with the exception of adipose tissue that had an overall level of detection of 78% .

correlation coeffcients were calculated based on hybridisation signals on the marmoset microarray for all possible combinations of tissues . the highest correlation coefficient  was obtained when comparing gene expression in both neuronal tissues, i.e. hippocampus and cortex, indicating a high degree of similarity in expression profiles. in contrast, comparing hippocampal gene expression to all peripheral tissues resulted in a severe drop in correlation coefficient , ranging from  <dig>  in muscle to  <dig>  in liver.

half of the probe sets of  were detectable  in all tissues we tested so far, albeit in most cases at varying levels. sorting of the expression profiles based on detection call allowed the identification of transcripts expressed exclusively in  <dig> of the  <dig> tissues tested. in liver, for example, we identified  <dig> probe sets with a present or marginal call that had absent calls in the other  <dig> tissues tested. three of these  <dig> probes sets represented cytochrome p- <dig>  enzymes that mediate the oxidative biotransformation of most drugs and are known to be predominantly expressed in liver  <cit> . detection of  <dig> probe sets was restricted to the kidney, one of which represented renin. renin is part of the renin-angiotensin system known to play a major role in volume regulation and is expressed at high levels in the kidney  <cit> . sperm protein  <dig> was exclusively expressed in testis. an explanation for the fact that we find a number of genes that appear to be exclusively expressed in other tissues than brain, while the origin of the ests is brain tissue, may be that these genes are predominantly derived from the list of  <dig> pre-existing genbank sequences on the array, which are not necessarily expressed in brain. indeed, this appears to be the case in many instances. for example, the  <dig> cytochrome p- <dig> probe sets exclusively expressed in liver are derived from pre-existing genbank sequences, as well as  <dig> of the  <dig> kidney-specific probe sets  and  <dig> of the  <dig> testis-specific probe sets . an additional explanation is that expression levels in brain may be too low to detect using microarrays, but were detectable in our normalised cdna library of hippocampus.

detection of a total of  <dig> probe sets was restricted to neuronal tissue  . among these  <dig> probe sets were several ion channels , neurotransmitter receptors , neural cell adhesion molecules  and diverse components involved in neurotransmitter secretion , axonogenesis  and neurotrophic factor signalling . it must be noted that although the sequences have been annotated, the information is not that detailed that for each gene the exact isoform or splice variant is indicated. for example, a closer look at the data of cacnb <dig> indicates that only isoform  <dig> is targeted by our sequence, which indeed is expressed in brain, while isoform  <dig> is expressed in muscle. the users of the marmoset microarray have access to the exact probe set sequences as well as the est sequences, allowing unambiguous determination of which part of the transcript is targeted and which splice variants or isoforms are detected.

ninety probe sets were not detected in any of the tissues tested, which may be an intrinsic property of the selected probes or due to potential sequencing errors resulting in mismatches of the probe sets with the labeled mrna .

discussion
we have constructed a marmoset-specific oligonucleotide microarray representing  <dig> different marmoset transcripts expressed in hippocampus. although the sequences are primarily derived from a cdna library of hippocampus, we have demonstrated that the marmoset array can also be efficiently used to characterise gene expression in other tissues of non-neuronal origin. the obtained detection rates are high, albeit somewhat lower in peripheral tissues than in neuronal tissue. the reproducibility of hybridisation is high, judged by the correlation  between both neuronal expression profiles . moreover, the obtained tissue-specific patterns of expression are in line with what can be expected, with neuronal genes expressed exclusively in hippocampus and cortex, cytochrome p-450s in liver, preprorenin in kidney and sperm protein  <dig> in testis.

in the process of development of the marmoset microarray we have generated a set of  <dig> marmoset 3' ests which have been submitted to genbank. the number of marmoset sequences present today in publically available sequence databases including genbank are  <dig> , which is a mix of working draft genomic sequence of the marmoset genome project,  mrna sequences and ests and contains several redundancies. our contribution of  <dig> different 3' ests is a substantial expansion of the number of marmoset sequences. both the marmoset array and the generated ests therefore significantly expand the available molecular tools for genetic analysis in this non-human primate animal model.

to our knowledge eumama is the first dna microarray specific for the common marmoset. as is the case with all first-generation microarrays for a species, some day in the future our marmoset microarray is likely to become obsolete and be replaced by an array targeting a larger part of the transcriptome. until there is a better replacement  this microarray is the only molecular tool allowing analysis of gene expression of a reasonably comprehensive number of genes expressed in marmoset brain. the strength of this array is not only that it is species-specific, but also that there are corresponding marmoset sequences available for genetic follow-up of differentially expressed transcripts. so far the availability of microarrays specific for non-human primates is very limited. oligonucleotide microarrays for the rhesus macaque  have recently become commercially available at both affymetrix and agilent  <cit> . however, today expression profiling in non-human primates including chimpanzee , orangutan , african green monkey , common marmoset  and cynomolgus monkeys  is still performed using human arrays  <cit> , despite the fact that sequence mismatches affect hybridisation intensity and likely result in a high level of false negatives or underrepresented expressed genes  <cit> . interspecies use of microarrays is particularly problematic when using human microarrays to study gene expression in non-human primates that are more divergent to humans than the great apes. while chimpanzee or orangutan have an average nucleotide sequence divergence of  <dig> –1% and 3% respectively  <cit> , the average sequence divergence of human and rhesus macaque is approximately 5%  <cit>  increasing to 11% when comparing the marmoset and human genome  <cit> . a 4–8% difference in sequence will cause each human-specific 25-mer probe on a microarray to contain on average a single nucleotide mismatch with its target  <cit> . a large effect of sequence divergence on hybridisation signal was found in a study using a multi-primate cdna array containing human, chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus sequences, even between organisms that are only diverged ~1%  <cit> . the general picture that emerges is that the use of single species arrays for comparison between species may be problematic and yield spurious results  <cit> , warranting careful data analysis and a significant amount of confirmatory analysis using other techniques. meanwhile, the clear need for generation of species-specific cdna and oligonucleotide-based microarray resources remains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have generated the first marmoset-specific dna microarray and demonstrated its use to characterise large scale gene expression profiles of hippocampus but also of other neuronal and peripheral tissues. in addition, we have generated a large collection of ests of marmoset origin which are now available in the public domain. these new tools will facilitate molecular genetic research into this non-human primate animal model.
