BACKGROUND
low temperature is one of the most important environmental stimuli that affect plant growth and development. common wheat, as a classical vernalization-required plant, is tolerant to lower temperatures at the vegetative development stage. however, it will suffer frost injury when low temperatures coincide with the reproductive stage of wheat. in spring, the low temperature occurring at the stage when pistil and stamen differentiate into anthers will cause anther sterility and floret abortion, leading to significant yield loss in wheat  <cit> . in the vegetative developmental stage, vernalization genes vrn <dig>  vrn <dig>  and vrn <dig> regulate the transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages and interconnect with the cold acclimation regulation locus fr <dig> including the cbf and cor genes. these genes have been characterized to respond to freezing tolerance  <cit> . for the spring freeze, stress-related, photosynthesis, and plastid-associated genes are demonstrated as responsive genes by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses  <cit> . for example, a set of spring freeze-responsive genes were identified by using the affymetrix genechip in barley  <cit> , while using a similar approach a variety of genes are reported to be involved in wheat spring freeze stimulus including wcor <dig>  lea, glycine-rich rna-binding protein, ferritin, aquaporin  <dig>  and a pathogen-induced protein, the ice recrystallization protein, cold-related proteins, cbf transcription factors, calcium-dependent protein kinases, na+/h+ antiporters, aquaporins, and many metabolic enzymes  <cit> . recently, rna-seq and digital gene expression analysis also identified a series of protein-coding genes from cold-treated young spikes in wheat  <cit> . in general, frost resistances at the vegetative stage and the reproductive stage seem to confer overlapping regulatory networks such as the one mediated by the cbf gene. despite this, gene networks for frost resistance at the reproductive stage appear to be more complicated and involve more physiological processes.

micrornas  are classical small non-coding rnas that guide post-transcriptional gene regulation. mirnas have been shown to play key roles in various biological processes, including development, hormone responses and stress adaptation . recently, many studies have demonstrated the role of plant mirnas in cold stress response. in arabidopsis,  <dig> mirnas, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were identified by rna gel blot analysis  <cit> , microarray analysis  <cit> , and a computation-based approach to be related to cold response  <cit> . in populus,  <dig> cold stress-responsive mirnas were identified by mirna microarray  <cit> , among which mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were overlapped with those in arabidopsis. in addition,  <dig> species-specific mirnas were identified as cold regulated in brachypodium by high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . these works indicate conserved mechanisms for cold-responsive mirnas as well as the diverged species-specific regulation. in common wheat , many conserved, triticum-specific, and wheat-specific mirnas have been identified, including the wheat a genome progenitor, the wheat d genome progenitor, and the aabbdd hexaploid wheat . mirnas have been identified to play important roles in various stresses in wheat  <cit> , including abiotic stresses such as salt  <cit> , drought  <cit> , dehydration  <cit> , phosphorus  <cit> , heat  <cit>  and biotic stresses such as the fungal infection of powdery mildew  <cit>  and puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici  <cit> . so far, six mirnas, mir167c, tae-mir167d, tae-mir172a, tae-mir <dig>  tae-mir396a, and tae-mir444c. <dig> were considered to be cold responsive in a thermosensitive genic male sterile  lines of wheat  <cit> . in addition, seven mirnas, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were also identified to be cold-responsive in the seedling of wheat  <cit> .

despite these efforts, our knowledge about the roles of mirnas in wheat response to cold stress is still limited. here, we sequenced small rnas of cold treated young spikes at the pistil and stamen differentiation stage and controls. a diverse set of wheat small rnas were identified, some of which were differentially expressed between cold-treated and control samples. mirna targets were then validated by degradome sequencing. by comparing with mirnas reported previously under other stress and developmental conditions, we provided a comprehensive picture of mirna functions in cold treated wheat inflorescences that may assist cold tolerance improvement in wheat.

methods
plant materials
the seeds of common wheat cultivar jm <dig> were germinated and grown in a 4 °c chamber for vernalization. after 40 days, the seedlings were transplanted to an artificial climate chamber with a relative humidity of 75% and 22 °c/16 °c day/night temperatures with a light intensity of 3000 lx. approximately 20 days after transplanting, most of the young spikes progressed into the pistil and stamen differentiation stage, and then the seedlings were divided into two groups. one group was moved to a chamber and grew under cold treatment at 0 °c for 48 h, while the other was used as the control sample and remained in the 22 °c/16 °c growth chamber.

rna isolation and small rna and degradome library construction
young spikes were pooled for the control samples or cold treatment samples after cold treatment for 48 h at 0 °c with two replications, respectively, and then were stored in liquid nitrogen for rna extraction. total rna was isolated using the trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions . rna quality was tested using a  <dig> bioanalyzer rna nanochip . the rna concentration was quantified using a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . two degradome libraries for the control and cold treatment samples were constructed following the method by german et al  <cit> .

bioinformatics analysis of small rna sequencing data
small rna and degradome reads were generated from illumina hiseqtm analysis. using the fastx-toolkit pipeline , the raw sequencing data were pre-processed to remove low-quality reads, reads smaller than  <dig> nucleotides , trim adaptor sequences, and contamination formed by adaptor-adaptor ligation. regarding the small rna sequencing data, clean reads ranging from  <dig> to 30 nt were aligned to the chinese spring genome from the iwgsc  website and the transcriptome dataset for young spikes of the common wheat downloaded from the geo dataset as srx <dig> by the bowtie program  <cit> . the reads were categorized as the exon, intron, and repeat-associated small rnas with a perfect match to the reference genome. perfectly matching sequences were identified for further analysis. the reads were annotated as rrna, trna, small nuclear rna , and small nucleolar rna  by alignments against the rfam  <dig>  database . the reads were identified as known mirnas by the blast search against the mirbase  <dig> database with at most two mismatches , and the wheat micrornas from pnrd , pmirexat , and iwgsc mirna dataset  <cit>  with the perfect match. after the removal of the known small rnas and repeat-associated small rnas, we used the mirdeep-p program with default parameters to predict the novel mirnas using a plant-specific scoring system and filtering criteria based on a probabilistic model of mirna biogenesis  <cit> .

bioinformatics analysis of degradome sequencing data
for the degradome sequencing data, the clean reads were generated using the same method for the small rna sequencing analysis. next, the clean reads were used to identify the cleavage sites of the mirna-target interaction by the program cleaveland  <cit> . the transcripts included the cds, utr of chinese spring  downloaded from the iwgsc website, and the assembled transcriptome from the zhang et al downloaded from the geo dataset as srx <dig>  <cit> . the cleavage sites were classified as the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> categories according to the abundance of reads in the slice sites along the whole transcripts with a p-value less than  <dig> .

quantification of mirna expression level by qrt-pcr
qrt-pcr was performed to determine the validity of mirna by deep sequencing for expression profile analysis. total rna was extracted as described above. according to previous reports  <cit> , the mirna abundance was detected. briefly, we first polyadenylated the total rna  including mirnas, and then used the mir-xtm mirna first-strand synthesis kit  to reverse transcribe poly  adapters into cdna. using the internal reference gene ubq, we normalized the cdna products  <cit> . these products were used as templates for qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr was performed on a lightcycler®  <dig>  using lightcycler  <dig> sybr green i . along the entire mirna sequence and adapter sequence provided by mirna first-strand synthesis kit , the mirna-specific forward primer for each mirna and the universal reverse primer were designed. the primers were shown in the additional file 1: table s <dig>  qpcr was performed according to the following protocol: 95 °c for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 °c for 5 s and 60 °c for 20 s, followed by a thermal denaturing step to generate the melt curves. all of the reactions were performed in triplicate, including non-template controls. statistical analysis was performed using the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit> .

total rna was extracted from samples according to the manufacturer’s instructions of the rnaiso plus kit . they were reverse transcribed with poly  adapters into cdna using a primescripttm rt reagent kit with gdna eraser kit . the cdna products of each tissue were normalized using actin  as the internal reference gene  <cit> . these products were used as templates for qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr was performed on a lightcycler®  <dig>  using lightcycler  <dig> sybr green i . the qrt-pcr programmes were performed according to the following protocol: 95 °c for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 °c for 5 s and 56 °c for 20 s, according to a thermal denaturing step to generate the melt curves. all reactions were run in triplicates, including the non-template controls. statistical analysis was performed using the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit> . the primers were shown in the additional file 1: table s <dig> 

RESULTS
sample collection and small rna sequencing
to investigate the response of mirnas to cold stress, four libraries of small rnas were constructed from young spikes at the pistil and stamen differentiation stage with and without cold stress, respectively , and with two biological replications. after the removal of contaminating reads, 20– <dig> million clean data representing  <dig> – <dig>  million distinct sequences were obtained . the high correlation between the two replicates, with r2 =  <dig>  for the control samples and r2 =  <dig>  for the cold-stress samples, indicated the high quality of the small rna libraries . next, we mapped these sequences to the genome of chinese spring. approximately 81–82% of the small rnas could be perfectly mapped to the genome, and there was no bias distribution among the three sets of subgenomes a, b, and d . most of the small rnas were located in the intergenic and repeat element regions, while only  <dig> to 6% small rnas were mapped to exon and intron regions. intriguingly, in the exon regions, the small rnas located in the subgenome b were significantly lower than those in the other two subgenomes, a and d , suggesting possible subgenome dominance of small rna regulation functions. the lengths of the small rnas ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides . most of the small rnas ranged from  <dig> to 24 nt and were used for subsequent analysis. for distinct small rnas, the 24-nt category was the most abundant, representing 71–73% among unique reads and 45–53% for redundant ones, followed by 21-nt small rnas . as shown in other plants, 24-nt sirnas may play a role in maintaining genome integrity and stabilization by heterochromatin formation  <cit> .fig.  <dig> young spikes at the pistil and stamen differentiation stage

identification of mirnas in wheat young spikes
the functions of many mirnas are conserved in plants, and these mirnas play important roles in development and stress responses  <cit> . mirnas were generated across the evolution of plants, the mirnas with important functions were retained as the plant-conserved mirnas, and some mirnas as monocot-specific or eudicot-specific mirnas came into being after the divergence of monocot and eudicot, and some mirnas as species-specific mirnas were generated after the species divergence  <cit> . to identify the plant-conserved mirnas in wheat, we aligned the cleaned small rnas to known plant mirnas downloaded from the mirbase , pnrd, pmirexat, and iwgsc mirna database using the blastn program. in total,  <dig> known mirnas from  <dig> families were obtained. among them,  <dig> conserved mirna families covered almost all of the plant-conserved mirna families. twenty-four grass-specific mirna families were identified, including those in rice, maize, sorghum, and brachypodium. recently, using the next-generation sequencing, many mirnas were identified in the bread wheat, their progenitor t. urartu and a. tauschii, emmer wheat t. turgidum, and barley  <cit> . these mirnas were defined as triticum-specific mirnas. here,  <dig> triticum-specific mirnas, as well as  <dig> wheat-specific mirnas, were identified . after the removal of these known mirnas and rfam-associated small rnas, we aligned the remaining small rnas to the genome for novel mirna discovery. to date, many wheat-specific mirnas have been deposited in the mirbase across different development stages and different stress responses. however, based on the special feature of the canonical stem-loop regions of longer rna precursors, we identified additional nine novel mirnas in the four small rna samples that met the previous reported criteria by the mirdeep-p program  <cit> . seven of them presented the mirna* sequences indicating bona fide mirnas . five of them were 24 nt in length, and four had 5’ terminal adenine nucleotides. the adenine preferences in the 5’ terminus were processed by the ago <dig> protein. thus, these newly discovered novel mirnas should increase the number of known mirna families.

the abundance of mirnas in wheat young spikes
to predict the potential roles of novel mirnas, we investigated their expression profiles. we found that  <dig> mirnas from nine families had reads more than ten thousands in at least one sample. most highly abundant mirnas were conserved mirnas such as mir <dig>  followed by mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  which also highly expressed in other plants  <cit> . intriguingly, grass-specific mir <dig>  triticum-specific mirnas including tae-mir <dig> and mir <dig>  as well as wheat-specific tae-mir <dig> and mir <dig>  also showed quite high expression levels . there were  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> families with more than one thousand reads in at least one sample. they were four plant conserved mirnas, four grass-specific mirnas, eight triticum-specific mirnas and four wheat-specific mirnas. the high expression levels of these mirnas may suggest their important biology functions. by contrast, some mirna families, including plant-conserved mirnas, were expressed at a lower abundance . for the novel mirnas, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were intermediately expressed with reads of more than one thousand, while the other mirnas were lowly expressed with only about one hundred reads . thus, mirnas were transcribed at various levels in young spikes during the differentiation of the pistil and stamen in wheat.

differential expression of mirnas under cold treatment
as have been shown in previous studies, mirnas are often associated with cold response in many plants such as arabidopsis, populus, brachypodium, and medicago  <cit> . here, we performed differential expression analysis of mirnas in young spikes with and without cold treatment. after normalizing reads of each mirna as ‘transcripts per million’  for each sample, we characterized  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas  from  <dig> mirna families using the degseq program   <cit> . twelve of these differentially expressed mirna families were conserved in plants, two were grass-specific mirnas, six triticum-specific, three wheat-specific mirnas, and five were newly identified novel mirnas. among them,  <dig> were down-regulated, and  <dig> were up-regulated with differential expression fold changes ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> times .fig.  <dig> differential expression profiles of mirnas. a fold change of differentially expressed mirnas between the control and cold-stressed libraries in young spikes at the pistil and stamen differentiation stage. red and blue colours represent up-regulated and down-regulated expression. b correlation of the differentially expressed mirnas validated by qrt-pcr compared to the illumina sequencing. c venn diagram of the micrornas response to cold stress among wheat, brachypodium, medicago, populus, and arabidopsis





to confirm the sequencing data, we selected  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas for qrt-pcr detection. the expression means of cold responsive mirnas as detected as by qrt-pcr was very similar to the fold change of the sequencing reads with a high correlation coefficients  . for example, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir171a, mir444c, mir <dig>  and mir5048a were identified by sequencing as down-regulated. such patterns were confirmed by qrt-pcr. similarly, mir159a, mir160b, mir165a, mir171c, mir319a, mir2118a, mir1130c, and the novel mirnas mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were also validated as being up-regulated by qrt-pcr, consistent with the results of illumina sequencing . these data demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of high-throughput sequencing.

among the  <dig> differentially expressed known mirna families, nine were overlapped with cold-stress mirnas from other species, such as arabidopsis , medicago  <cit> , populus  <cit> , and brachypodium  <cit>  . mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> showed the cold-stress response in at least three species, and mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> overlapped with populus, arabidopsis, and medicago . however, some mirnas were found to be species-specific , suggesting divergent regulatory pathways in wheat.

mirna target prediction
to understand mirna functions, we performed target prediction of mirnas by the targetfinder program  <cit>  and targets with scores less than four were further analysed. we found that targets of many known mirnas were mostly associated with development and stress . for example, mir <dig> targets an spb gene while mir <dig> targets an ap2-like ethylene-responsive transcription factor , both of which mediate the transition of the vegetative stage to reproductive stage . other cold responsive mirnas, mir <dig> and mir <dig>  targeted tcp and mads-box genes were involved flower development  <cit> . additionally, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were predicted to target the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase family  that are involved in disease resistance  <cit> , as well as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> that regulated the wd domain gene for flower development and the immune system  .

for novel mirnas, a total of eight mirna-target interaction were predicted. as shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the predicted targets include gene encoding zipper proteins, binding proteins, protein kinases, enzymes and transporters that are potentially involved in multiple cellular processes. some target genes have been shown to be also involved in stress responses. for instances, the homeobox-leucine zipper protein family regulated by tae-mir <dig> and tae-mir <dig> has been shown to be involved in the water stress and abscisic acid treatment in arabidopsis  <cit> , while the casp-like protein, which is targeted by tae-mir <dig>  mediates the environmental stress response in plants except for the pathogen-induced membrane protein gene in bacterial disease resistance and oomycete disease susceptibility in pepper  <cit> . in addition, the lrr, which participates in plant defence, regulated of the developmental process and the sensing or transduction of hormone signals in plants  <cit> . these genes were predicted to be regulated by tae-mir <dig> and tae-mir <dig>  also, the sugar transporter gene that was targeted by the tae-mir <dig> plays a central role in pathogen resistance in rice and cassava  <cit> .

to confirm the coordinated expressions of target genes with those of cold responsive mirnas,  <dig> predicted target genes were selected to perform qrt-pcr assays. the results showed that six target genes displayed coordinated expression patterns with corresponding mirnas while other six showed expression patterns opposite to the expected , which could be caused by more complicated regulation of the target genes such as by other transcription factors.

mirna target validation by degradome sequencing
to validate that mirnas found there can indeed cleave predicted targets, we performed degradome sequencing using the same wheat inflorescence samples. after removing contaminating reads,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained in the two degradome libraries, respectively, one control and one cold treated.  <dig> % and  <dig> % of them were  <dig> and  <dig> nts in length, respectively . a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads  were overlapped between the two libraries. among them,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  reads were aligned to the cds sequences comprising the chinese spring and transcriptome datasets, respectively  <cit> . using the cleaveland program,  <dig> known mirnas from  <dig> families and  <dig> from  <dig> families were confirmed to cleave the targets with a p-value less than  <dig>  using the degradome sequences in the control and cold-stressed libraries, respectively . one hundred and twenty two mirnas from  <dig> mirna families were verified to cleave the targets using the degradome sequences in at least one library. totally,  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> families were demonstrated to interact with targets in the two libraries. in total,  <dig> and  <dig> transcript cleaved sites were confirmed in degradome libraries, and more than half of them were either defined as the ‘ <dig> category’ with the maximum tags or only one peak at the cleavage site on the transcript . examples for the ‘ <dig> categories’ are shown in fig. 4a-d. in addition,  <dig> mirna-transcript pairs were shared between the two libraries, and  <dig> and  <dig> were characterized specifically in the control and cold stress libraries, respectively. among transcripts detected by degradome sequencing,  <dig> transcripts were predicted as targets with a score less than four using the targetfinder program. for the novel mirnas, all nine mirnas were identified to regulate the  <dig> transcripts in the two libraries. there were six mirnas with  <dig> interaction transcripts overlapped between the two libraries, in which three mirnas with three interaction transcripts specifically were identified in the control libraries and four with nine targeting transcripts were specifically identified in the cold stress libraries . moreover, as shown in table  <dig>  a significant number of transcripts detected by degradome sequencing have been reported previously such as mir156-sbp, mir172-ap <dig>  mir160-arf , mir169-nfya , mir319-tcp, and mir9863-nbs, indicating conserved mirna-target interaction in plants.fig.  <dig> target plots  of mir <dig> , mir <dig> , mir <dig> , and mir <dig>  characterized by degradome sequencing. the abundance of the signature tags was plotted along the indicated transcript. the red dots indicate the predicted cleavage sites on the x axis; the black line indicates the signatures produced by mirna-directed cleavage





aat least two transcripts were present in the degradome data




gene enrichment  analysis for target genes of differentially expressed mirnas
to better understand the function of these differentially expressed mirnas, enrichment analysis for  <dig> target genes of significantly differentially expressed mirnas was analysed using the bingo program  <cit> . the go term annotation of wheat genes was performed according to the chinese spring genome release available from the iwgsc website. the results showed that  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> go terms were significantly enriched  in the biological process, molecular function, and cellular component categories, respectively. for the biological process, most of the enriched go terms were classified as the biological regulation such as regulation of transcription, rna metabolic process, and macromolecule biosynthesis process, suggesting that changes in gene transcription regulation occur in response to the cold stimulus in wheat. for the response stimulus pathway, go terms for the response to the endogenous stimulus, organic substance, and hormone stimulus were enriched. the analysis also showed that plants may have induced the salvage pathway in response to cold stress via the enriched go terms such nucleotide salvage, purine nucleotide salvage and imp salvage . although most of differentially expressed mirnas are involved in stress responses, some of them may also affect ion transport, such as the presence of the enriched go term sulphate transport. regarding the molecular function category, the transcript regulation activity pathway was enriched, such as the dna binding, adp binding, and transcript factor activity go terms. the go terms related to the sulphate transmembrane transport activity were both enriched in molecular function and biological process . for the cellular component category, the membrane-bounded organelle, intracellular membrane-bounded organelle, and nucleus go terms were enriched, suggesting that the membrane component was affected under cold stress, leading to the change in membrane permeability that may influence ion transport. interestingly, most response genes were found to be located in the nucleus . overall, our work showed that differentially expressed mirnas may respond to cold stress by regulating their target genes.fig.  <dig> go enrichment analysis for the targets of significantly differentially expressed mirnas. cytoscape views of enriched go terms were shown in biological process , molecular function , and cellular component  for the targets of differentially expressed mirnas by cold stress. the coloured nodes and white nodes represent the go terms enriched and non-enriched in the target genes, respectively

mirnas are extensively involved in cold responses in plants
the sensitive response of mirna expression levels during cold treatment indicates that mirnas are important regulatory nodes for plant cold response. although different species confer different set of mirnas responding to cold, there a set of core mirnas that are shared by most species. in wheat,  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> families were differentially expressed under cold treatment. among them,  <dig>  were conserved in plants, i.e., conserved in arabidopsis, populus, brachypodium, and medicago  <cit> . the remaining appears to be temperate grass-specific. it is not clear if plants growing in cold weather develop more complicated cold response mechanisms. judging from the functions of their targets, we found that genes regulated by cold are often involved in other stress response such as heat, drought, and salt stress. many conserved mirnas are also closely involved in plant development. despite this, some mirnas seem to be functioning mainly in stress responses. for instance, mir <dig> is a cold response mirna in wheat as shown in this study. mir <dig> targets the leaf curling responsiveness  gene which is involved in salt and drought stress responses, and fe-responsive in arabidopsis  <cit> . similar, mir <dig> was found to respond to drought stress in wheat as well  <cit> , while grass-specific mirna mir <dig> targets yellow stripe like  <dig>  which together with ysl <dig> controls iron release from chloroplasts  <cit> . the differential expression of mir <dig> under cold stress may affect the iron transporter as suggested by gene ontology analysis. in addition, mir <dig> was identified to respond to cold stress by the regulation of nfya in arabidopsis  <cit> , populus  <cit> , and brachypodium  <cit> . mir <dig> as a big mirna family in plants were detected with various expression in different tissues  <cit> , which also response to drought, salinity, heat and powdery mildew resistance  <cit> . however, only two mirna members mir169g and mir169n with the drought responsive element and aba-responsive element were showed to the response to the drought and salinity stresses through aba-dependent and aba-independent stress-inducible gene expression pathways  <cit> . therefore, the post-transcriptional regulatory mode of mirnas to their targets probably provides more efficient regulation on multiple genes that function in different biological processes.

co-induction of mirnas by cold and other stresses
although cold response mirnas seem to be prevalent in plants, they are also responsive to other stress conditions. up to date, most cold-responsive mirnas also respond to additional abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . in wheat, for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig> are involved in the response to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . both mir <dig> and mir <dig> targets auxin-response factors , but they displayed opposite expression patterns. mir <dig> was up-regulated and mir <dig> down-regulated in this study, which is similar to their expression profiles in medicago in response to cold and freezing stresses  <cit> . in addition, they were both heat-responsive mirnas  <cit> . in wheat and aegilops tauschii, mir <dig> exhibited the reverse responses to drought stress. mir <dig> is up regulated after drought stress in aegilops tauschii, while down regulated in wheat  <cit> . for the nutrient stresses, mir <dig> had a role in the n homeostasis  <cit> , and mir <dig> was observed to responsive to pi deprivation in wheat  <cit> . in the biotic stress, mir <dig> were also involved in the defence responses to the infection of puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici in wheat  <cit> , while mir <dig> were responsive to the magnaporthe oryzae infection in rice  <cit> . thus, mirna may regulate different auxin regulation factors involved in different stress response pathways. in wheat, mir <dig> is inducible by abiotic stresses, including heat, cold in this study, salt, drought, dehydration and nutrient stress such as n deficiency, cd stress, and phosphorus stresses, as well as biotic stress such as powdery mildew infection and puccinia striiformis stress , whereas it showed transient or mild regulation under cold stress in arabidopsis  <cit> . differential expression of the myb-mir <dig> module was detected as aluminum toxicity-responsive in soybean and fe-responsive in arabidopsis  <cit> . since over-expression of mir <dig> leads to male sterility, cold stress may be one important factor to inhibit anther development via mirnas  <cit> , which could be as promising candidates to be used in development of higher yielding in wheat  <cit> .

the correlation of cold responsive mirnas with biotic response was exemplified by mir <dig> which targets btb/pob, a disease-resistance domain protein that is involved in the immune system responses, including those to biotic stress such as powdery mildew infection  <cit> . similarly, mir <dig> targets disease resistance with the classical domain nb-arc  that triggers isolate-specific immune responses against the powdery mildew fungus in triticum  <cit> . the cross response of mirna to biotic and abiotic stress was also observed. mir <dig>  for example, responds to powdery mildew infection, heat, dehydration and cold stress via targeting the spx family  <cit> . the spx family is associated with sensitivity to cold stress in rice seedlings  <cit>  and semi-male sterility, resulting in the reduction of grain yield in rice  <cit> . these versatile regulatory capabilities demonstrate mirnas as plural potent regulator for plant stress responses.

among cold responsive mirnas, mir <dig> and mir <dig> are most important developing related mirnas. in arabidopsis, the interaction of mir <dig> and mir <dig> controls developmental timing by the regulation of spb and ap <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . furthermore, mir <dig> acts in concert to secure male fertility by targeting the spb transcript factors in arabidopsis  <cit> . thus, overexpressed mirna <dig> will increase the biomass in cereals such as the energy crop switchgrass. in wheat, mir <dig> responds to heat, drought, dehydration, and cd stresses, and fungus stresses in wheat  <cit> , while tae-mir <dig> expresses in the tapetum and microsporocytes at the anther development stage  <cit> . the response of mir <dig> and mir <dig> to cold, heat, and drought are conserved in arabidopsis, rice, and brachypodium  <cit> . mir <dig> responds to powdery mildew infection  <cit> , dehydration  <cit> , drought  <cit> , and salinity stresses  <cit>  in wheat, which is also shown responding to cold stress in this study. it targeted the gras  family. in gras, the member of gs <dig>  plays an important role in the control of grain development in rice  <cit> . mir <dig>  which responds to both cold stress and drought stress in wheat  <cit> , was also characterized in arabidopsis and rice for cold stress . it targets members of the tcp gene family, which is specifically expressed in the flower organs  <cit> , which will contribute to the higher yield in crops under stress conditions. mir <dig> regulates the mads-box genes, especially in monocot species, and has been demonstrated to regulate flower development  <cit> . in wheat, it was observed to respond to powdery mildew infection  <cit> , dehydration  <cit> , drought  <cit>  and cold stress in our study. mads <dig> was demonstrated to specifically regulate the floral organ number, filament length and pollen release in soybean  <cit> . other less conserved mirnas that respond to cold treatment are also involved in developmental processes. for instance, mir <dig> triggers the generation of phased sirnas, which are involved in panicle development  <cit> , while mir <dig> and mir <dig> targets the ppr protein gene, which regulates inflorescence branch development in rice  <cit>  and can restore fertility in the cytoplasmic male-sterile line in brassica napus  <cit> . mir <dig> targets the u-box. the u-box/arm was discovered to regulate flowering time in arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, there are a number of targets of cold responsive mirnas that also work in plant development, especially flower development, male sterility, and floret and spike development. such an observation is interesting and may be the result of the tissue and treatment we sued in this study because the real cold tolerance genes such as cbf, fr <dig>  cor, and lea seem not to be the target of any mirnas. in other words, the dramatic change in mirna expression levels in wheat young inflorescences will cause sensitive reaction of their targets which will regulate proper flower organ development and hence the correct timing in the wild. such mechanisms may be explored to manipulate genetically to enhance cold tolerance in wheat contributing to yield increase.

CONCLUSIONS
this work provides the first small rna expression profiles of young spikes at the differentiation stage of the pistil and stamen in common wheat. our small rna sequencing data and degradome dataset revealed regulatory roles of mirnas during wheat cold response. the cross-response of mirnas to multi-biotic and abiotic stresses indicated that wheat has evolved sophisticated mirna-mediated pathways to cope with ever changing environments. further study of these mechanisms should help our understanding of plant cold response and further secure grain yield in wheat.
