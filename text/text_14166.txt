BACKGROUND
genetic linkage maps constitute an ideal framework for studies of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits  <cit>  and genome evolution  <cit> . they are also a prerequisite for map-based gene cloning  <cit>  and for the ordering of physical scaffolds in genome sequencing projects  <cit> . furthermore they are essential tools for marker assisted plant breeding  <cit> .

comparative analyses of genetic maps across phylogenetically related species are based on the development of transferable and orthologous genetic makers. simple sequence repeats  are the markers of choice, because they are reproducible, abundant in the genome and they provide highly polymorphic information and are readily transferable between phylogenetically related species  <cit> . their properties are highly prevalent in est-derived ssrs, making these markers particularly useful, as shown for theobroma <cit> , silena <cit> , prunus <cit> , dactylis <cit>  and citrus <cit> . ssrs are also easy to handle and, once developed, are cost-effective markers for high-throughput genotyping.

in the last  <dig> years, several linkage maps have been generated for the three main genera of the fagaceae family: oaks , beeches , and chestnuts . these long-lived species constitute important economic and ecological resources and have been the focus of genetic investigations relating to their evolution and more applied objectives, such as those of conservation and breeding programs  <cit> . linkage maps have been established to support forward genetic approaches for studying the genetic architecture of adaptive traits  and to increase our knowledge of the structural features of the oak genome and its evolutionary history.

first-generation linkage maps have been obtained with anonymous rapd and aflp markers for oak  <cit> , chestnut  <cit>  and beech  <cit> . qtl studies, mostly in oak, have focused on dissecting the genetic architecture of adaptive traits, such as growth and bud phenology  <cit>  and of traits related to species divergence between pedunculate and sessile oaks, two species occurring in sympatry in europe  <cit> . a limited number of genomic ssrs  and est-based  markers  <cit> , have also been added to these maps. these markers allowed to align homologous linkage groups between oak and chestnut and to compare and validate the qtls that had been previously characterized in the two genera  <cit> . a first step toward the construction of a dense ssr-based genetic map was taken recently, with the development and mapping of  <dig> est-ssrs  <cit> . the authors used a selective mapping strategy with a bin set of  <dig> highly informative offspring from a single full-sib  mapping population for which an aflp framework map was available. ssr markers were assigned to  <dig> bins of the female and  <dig> bins of the male parental maps, spanning the entire genome.

the main goal of this study was to advance the establishment of a dense est-ssr-based map for oak, by genotyping trees with a broader genetic background and using a larger set of genomic and est-ssrs. our specific objectives were as follows:

i) to optimize comparative mapping between two quercus species by identifying a subset of ssrs that were transferable and orthologous across different mapping pedigrees. we genotyped a total of  <dig> offspring from five families obtained from controlled crosses of the q. robur and q. petraea genotypes. we then generated  <dig> individual linkage maps  by the two-way pseudo-testcross mapping strategy  <cit>  and constructed consensus maps for each species from  <dig> genomic and est-based ssr markers.

ii) to determine gene content  and order  between these two sympatric species  <cit> .

iii) to assess the transferability of a subset of est-ssrs in several fagaceae and nothofagaeae species and to describe the genetic diversity of several oak populations depending on the type of the repeated motifs. we also mapped transferable est-ssrs, in european chestnut for which two linkage maps were available  <cit>  making it possible to refine the first comparative map for oak and chestnut  <cit> .

iv) to unravel the evolutionary paleohistory of oak chromosomes, by genetic mapping of  <dig> est-ssr and  <dig> snp-based markers identified from oak transcriptome sequence information .

these four objectives are interconnected, as shown in figure  <dig> 

methods
functional annotation of est-ssrs
the functional annotation of est-ssrs was based on gene ontology  <cit>  and was performed with blast2go  <cit> , using the following parameters: blastx search against the non redundant ncbi database .

on the basis of go categories, we assigned oak ests containing ssr motifs  to three principal groups: biological processes, cellular compounds and molecular functions. the go classification obtained was compared  between four sets of sequences containing ssrs: 3’utrs , 5’utrs , coding regions  and non-coding regions .

mapping of ssrs in q. robur and q. petraea and construction of consensus species maps
mapping populations
five mapping pedigrees  of variable sample sizes were used , consisting of one q. robur x q. petraea, one q. petraea and three q. robur full-sib families. these full-sibs were installed at the nurseries of inra , the university of göttingen  and alterra . dna was extracted from the leaves with the dneasy plant mini kit , according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

development of ssr markers and genotyping
a subset of  <dig> est-ssrs identified by durand et al.  <cit>  was screened for polymorphisms against the  <dig> parents of the five mapping populations and four offspring per pedigree. we added  <dig> genomic ssrs  described in previous studies  <cit> , kawaharat pers comm) to the screening step . we then used the polymorphic markers to genotype the five mapping populations.

pcr amplification and fragment separation were optimized for m <dig> fluorescently labeled tailed primers  <cit> . pcr was performed in a final volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> x pcr buffer  ,  <dig> μm of dntps,  <dig>  μm forward primers,  <dig>  μm reverse primer ,  <dig>  μm m <dig> primer,  <dig>  u of taq polymerase  and  <dig> to  <dig> ng of plant dna. the cycling conditions were as described by schuelke et al.,  <cit> : initial denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> minutes, followed by  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> s, 56°c for  <dig> s, and 72°c for  <dig> s, nine touchdown cycles of 94°c for  <dig> s, 53°c for  <dig> s, and 72°c for  <dig> s and a final extension at 72°c for  <dig> minutes. depending on the pedigree and partners, electrophoresis was performed with the licor  <dig> ir <dig> system , the abi  <dig> system  or the megabace tm  <dig>  <dig> capillary electrophoresis system . the data generated were analyzed with the  <dig> dna analyzer software for the licor system, genescan  <dig>  and genotyper  <dig>  for abi  <dig> and fragment profiler <dig>  for megabace.

individual map construction
we constructed  <dig> parental genetic linkage maps  by the two-way pseudo-test cross mapping strategy  <cit> . linkage analysis was performed with joinmap version  <dig>   <cit> . polymorphic ssr loci were classified into three categories: testcross markers segregating in a 1: <dig> ratio, testcross markers segregating in a 1:1:1: <dig> ratio and intercross markers segregating in a 1:2: <dig> ratio. chi-squared goodness-of-fit tests were used to identify markers with patterns of segregation departing from mendelian expectations. loci with distorted ratios  were excluded from linkage map construction. individuals and loci for which more than 50% of the data were missing were excluded from the analysis. a minimum lod score of  <dig> and a maximum recombination fraction of  <dig>  were set as the linkage thresholds for marker grouping. maternal and paternal datasets were created with the “create maternal and paternal population nodes” command in joinmap. the regression mapping algorithm was used for map construction. recombination frequencies were converted into map distances in centimorgans , with the kosambi mapping function. linkage groups were drawn with mapchart  <cit> .

estimation of genome size
genome length  was estimated from partial linkage data, according to the formula l = nd/k, where n is the number of framework markers, d is the maximum distance between two adjacent markers  at a minimum lod score for linkage, and k is the number of marker pairs with a lod value exceeding a minimum threshold  <cit> . lod score thresholds of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were used to estimate genome length.

construction of consensus genetic linkage maps for q. robur and q. petraea
consensus species maps for q. robur and q. petraea were established by combining parental map datasets for each species with the “join-combine groups for map integration” command of joinmap, which creates a composite map from different linkage groups sharing common markers. we used the mapping parameters and options described above. we assessed the heterogeneity of recombination rates between ssr marker pairs, and ssr markers with highly heterogeneous recombination rates were excluded from the construction of species-specific framework maps. markers that could not be ordered with the same degree of confidence were added as accessory markers, using the two-point lod scores and recombination fraction available from the “maximum linkage” table of joinmap. similarly, when several markers were found to be collocated, only one was retained on the species framework map; the others were added as accessory markers.

databases
single-tree genotypic data for offspring and linkage maps are available from the quercusmap database of the quercus portal , the european genetic and genomic web resources for quercus. dna sequences and primer pairs for ssr loci are available from the ssr database at the same url.

transferability of est-ssrs and comparative mapping of oak and chestnut
transferability of est-ssrs
we assessed the transferability of est-ssr markers to other fagaceae species, by carrying out cross-species amplification in six species . we also assessed transferability to two species of the related family nothofagaceae . each species was represented by at least two individuals. ssr amplification and genotyping were performed as described above, with a subset of  <dig> est-ssrs randomly selected from the list reported by durand et al.  <cit> . the selected microsatellite markers included  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri-,  <dig> tetra-,  <dig> penta- and  <dig> hexanucleotide repeats.

comparative mapping of quercus and castanea
in total,  <dig> offspring of a single full-sib pedigree of castanea sativa were genotyped with quercus est-ssrs. we assessed the amplification of  <dig> loci using the pcr conditions described above. polymorphic ssrs were added to the polymorphic markers already available for this pedigree . individual parental maps and a consensus map were constructed with joinmap, using the same procedure followed for quercus. finally, homologous linkage groups in quercus and castanea were identified from the location of orthologous markers displaying multiple and parallel linkages.

diversity analysis
two experiments were carried out to provide insight into the genetic diversity of est-ssrs. the first focused on a large number of loci in a small number of individuals of the two sympatric species q. robur and q. petraea . we assessed the polymorphism of the same set of  <dig> oak est-ssrs for  <dig> individuals from each species. dna was extracted from leaves with the dneasy plant mini kit . an m <dig> tail  was added to the 5’-end of each forward primer, as described by schuelke  <cit> . each pcr was performed in a total volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> x pcr buffer,  <dig> μm of each dntp,  <dig>  u taq polymerase ,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μm of each primer, and  <dig> ng of template dna. all est-ssr markers were amplified with an eppendorf thermal cycler , by a touchdown procedure:  <dig> min at 94°c,  <dig> touchdown cycles of 94°c for  <dig> s, 60°c for  <dig> s , 72°c for  <dig> s;  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> s, 50°c for  <dig> s, 72°c for  <dig> s and a final extension at 72°c for  <dig> min. the fluorescently labeled pcr products were separated by capillary electrophoresis, with a  <dig> bp size standard, in a megabace tm  <dig>  <dig> capillary electrophoresis system. alleles were sized with fragment profiler version  <dig> .

genetic diversity parameters  of q. robur and q. petraea were calculated using the fstat software package version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , which is implemented for the sample-size independent rarefaction analysis of allelic richness.

the second experiment was conceived as a proof of concept for the use of the est-ssrs in the genetic analysis of the largely unknown semi-decidious oak species distributed around the mediterranean basin. we genotyped  <dig> individuals from the two sub-mediterranean oak species quercus faginea and quercus pyrenaica with  <dig> est-ssrs evenly distributed among the  <dig> linkage groups . additional file  <dig> shows the locations of the  <dig> populations per species that were selected to represent most of the geographic and ecological variation in the two species. dna was extracted from leaf samples using a modified ctab method because many of the q. pyrenaica samples clogged the columns of commercial dna extraction kits. the main modification to the standard dna extraction procedure was the thorough chloroform extraction  following cell lysis in the ctab buffer. pcrs were performed in a total volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> x pcr buffer,  <dig> μm of each dntp,  <dig>  u taq polymerase ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μm forward primers,  <dig>  μm reverse primer,  <dig>  μm m13-fluorescent primer and  <dig> ng of template dna. cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step  followed by  <dig> touch-down cycles ,  <dig> cycles at  <dig> °c annealing temperature,  <dig> cycles at  <dig> °c annealing temperature and a final extension step . the fluorescently labelled pcr products were electrophoretically separated in an abi <dig> sequencer  using the gs500liz size standard. peak sizes were scored with genemapper v. <dig>  and allele binning was performed with msatallele r package  <cit> . genetic diversity parameters  were estimated with fstat v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

oak genome evolution
gene choice and genotyping of snp-based markers
we constructed an integrated map for quercus based on the est-ssrs and an additional set of snp-based markers, for analysis of the synteny between the oak linkage map and those of other previously sequenced eudicots.

we identified  <dig> candidate genes  for involvement in bud burst on the basis of the following criteria: i) differential expression between the periods before and after bud flush  <cit> , ii) colocalization with bud burst qtls  <cit> , and iii) a known functional role in model plants. two types of polymorphisms were identified: in vitro snps/indels from resequenced gene fragments from a panel of nine oak populations  <cit>  and unpublished data and in-silico snps/indels retrieved from expressed sequence tags  <cit>  as described by lepoittevin et al.  <cit> . finally,  <dig> in vitro and  <dig> in silico snps/indels were included in a 384-snp assay, including  <dig> insertions-deletions  of between  <dig> and to  <dig> bp in size. full description of the snp array is provided by alberto et al.  <cit> .

genotyping was carried out on three mapping populations comprising  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> f <dig> plants from the p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> pedigrees, respectively. dna was extracted with the invisorb dna plants  <dig> kit from invitek , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. multiplex reactions were prepared with  <dig> ng of template dna per sample. genotyping was carried out with the illumina goldengate snp genotyping platform  at the genome-transcriptome facility in bordeaux, france . the intensity of the fluorescent signals was measured with the beadxpress reader  and analyzed with genomestudio v  <dig> . <dig> . quality scores were generated for each genotype, using a gencall <dig>  score cutoff of  <dig>  and a callrate  threshold of  <dig> . these scores reflect the quality of genotype clusters  and the proportion of samples with a genotype defined for a particular snp   <cit> . genotype clusters were adjusted manually if necessary.

in addition to this first set of markers, seven candidate genes  for drought and hypoxia tolerance  were found to be informative in one to three pedigrees. two methods were used for genotyping: i) sscp , and ii) primer extension with the detection of fluorescence polarization  <cit>  with the acycloprime-fp snp detection kit . genotyping was carried out in accordance with the kit manufacturer’s instructions and fluorescence was measured with a fluorescence polarization reader  at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cycles.

consensus map construction
the consensus map was constructed by joining the  <dig> independent parental maps based on the mapping populations in which est-ssrs  and snp-based markers  were mapped. joinmap was first used to calculate individual maps from raw segregation data, with the kosambi mapping function. a minimum lod score threshold of  <dig>  was used for the grouping of all markers. an integrated map was then constructed for each linkage group, by integrating the “bridge markers” common to two or more individual maps. for construction of the consensus map, we assumed that the rates of recombination between the two species and between male and female maps were uniform .

using the regression algorithm of joinmap, we obtained three maps with different levels of statistical support for ordering  for each linkage group. for macrosynteny analysis, we decided to retain the most reliable map , adding markers with lower lod scores as accessory markers. the position of each accessory marker relative to its most probable framework marker was then determined from the two-point lod scores and recombination fractions provided by the “maximum linkage” table of joinmap. finally, markers were assigned to  <dig> cm bins within each of the  <dig> linkage groups of the consensus map, for the identification of regions orthologous to sequences in arabidopsis, grape, poplar, medicago and soybean.

evolutionary analysis
genome sequences
the arabidopsis , grape , poplar , medicago  and soybean  genome sequences were downloaded. cds annotations  were considered for the synteny and duplication analyses described below. we mined the arabidopsis, grape, poplar, medicago and soybean sequence databases to identify genes paralogous and orthologous to the  <dig>  sanger-based oak unigenes described by ueno et al.  <cit> .

synteny and duplication analysis
we used blast to align genomes . we used two parameters for these analyses, to take into account not only similarity but also the relative lengths of the aligned sequences: cip  and calp . cip = ∑ corresponds to the cumulative percentage sequence identity observed for all the high-scoring sequence pairs  divided by the cumulative aligned length , which corresponds to the sum of all hsp lengths. calp , is the cumulative al for all hsps divided by the length of the query sequence. the use of these parameters for blast analysis resulted in the highest cumulative percentage identity over the longest cumulative length, thus maximizing stringency in the definition of conservation between the two genomes compared.

distribution of paralogous and orthologous gene pairs
we estimated sequence divergence and dated speciation events, based on the rates of non-synonymous  and synonymous  substitutions calculated with mega- <dig>  <cit> . the mean substitution rate  for grasses —  <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions per synonymous site per year — was used to determine the ages of the genes considered  <cit> . the time  since gene insertion was then estimated with the formula t = ks/r.

RESULTS
functional annotation of est-ssrs
we identified more than  <dig>  est-ssrs among the quercus ests  <cit> . as a first step towards functional characterization of the est-containing ssrs, we used the slim go classification and compared the annotations for four sets of sequences containing ssrs: coding regions , non-coding regions , 5’utrs and 3’utrs. we identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gene categories, at “level 3”, within the biological process , cell compound  and molecular function  classes, respectively . about half the ssrs in the bp class belong to four main categories: “primary metabolic processes” , “cellular metabolic processes” , “macromolecule metabolic processes”  and “biosynthetic processes” . for the cc class, 80% of the ssrs were assigned to the “cell part”  and “membrane-bound organelle”  categories. for the mf class, six categories of similar size accounted for most of the ssrs: namely “nucleic acid binding” , “protein binding” , “nucleotide binding” , “ion binding” , “transferase activity”  and “hydrolase activity” . the distribution of these categories was similar between the four datasets , indicating a lack of ability of gene ontology to discriminate between the different transcribed regions in terms of the presence of ssrs. however, slight differences between transcribed regions were nevertheless observed when all categories were considered together in a hierarchical clustering analysis , but the distribution between the bp, cc and mf classes of the four datasets remained inconsistent.

ssr-based map construction in q. robur and q. petraea and synteny analysis
identification of polymorphic markers
in total, we identified  <dig> primer pairs, which were tested for polymorphism in at least one pedigree . overall,  <dig> est-ssrs were informative. we tested  <dig> of the gssrs already available for the fagaceae;  <dig>  were found to be polymorphic in at least one pedigree. thus, in total,  <dig> polymorphic loci  were available for further mapping.

construction of individual linkage maps
genotypic data were available for  <dig> loci in one to five mapping populations among them  <dig> were mapped. we found that 50% to 85% of the loci tested were polymorphic, depending on the pedigree. the interspecific pedigree  was found to be less polymorphic than the intraspecific pedigrees . differences in levels of polymorphism between intra vs. interspecific pedigrees are likely be due to sampling effects, as the two species exhibit similar levels of genetic diversity and very low interspecific differentiation. the number of tested loci found to be polymorphic varied considerably between the parents, from  <dig> loci for p5-female  to  <dig> loci for p1-female . distorted loci were more frequent for p2-female  from the interspecific pedigree  than for the other pedigrees . unlinked loci were rare . in the following analyses, we focused on the four pedigrees  because of the smaller set of data for p <dig> 

linkage group  statistics
we constructed  <dig> lgs for each parental map, except for the interspecific p2-male parent, for which lg <dig> was missing due to the fact that all markers were distorted and therefore excluded a priori from linkage map construction. interestingly, lg <dig> for the p2-female parent also included four distorted loci suggesting the presence of loci involved in species incompatibility. the development and mapping of a large amount of snp markers will certainly provide new insights into the identification and mapping of loci involved in reproductive barriers between these two hybridizing oak species.

the mean number of markers per lg was between  <dig>  for lg <dig> and  <dig>  for lg <dig> over the  <dig> maps,  . the mean map length of the various lgs was between  <dig>  cm for lg <dig> and  <dig>  cm for lg <dig>  with an overall mean of  <dig>  cm over the  <dig> maps .

estimation of total genome length
the total observed map length was  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm . based on these partial linkage data, estimated genome sizes were obtained for various lod score values . they ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  cm .

number of alleles of mapped ssrs
the number of alleles observed in the  <dig> parents depended on the type of motif considered: the number of loci with three or four alleles was systematically higher for loci with dinucleotide repeats than for those with trinucleotide or hexanucleotide repeats . this trend was conserved even if we excluded gssrs from the analysis.

mapping with several pedigrees
the genotyping of several pedigrees significantly increased the number of loci identified as polymorphic . p <dig> was the most informative pedigree in terms of mapped markers . however, adding p <dig> to the analysis increased the number of markers identified as polymorphic by 24% . successive additional inclusions of p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> increased the number of polymorphic markers identified by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ssrs, respectively. for the  <dig> linkage groups obtained for each parental map, the number of markers common to at least two maps varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the information provided by each marker for the  <dig> genotyped parents varied from  <dig> % polymorphic loci for one parent, to  <dig> % for two,  <dig> % for  <dig>   <dig> % for  <dig>   <dig> % for  <dig>  11% for  <dig> and less than 5% for  <dig> or more . the number of shared loci per linkage map decreased with the number of maps considered. in total,  <dig> mapped ssrs were common to two parental maps, whereas only two were common to nine parental maps.

consensus maps for q. robur and q. petraea and comparative mapping
a consensus map for q. robur was constructed from the seven q. robur parental maps. this map includes  <dig> markers  and spans  <dig> cm . similarly, a consensus map for q. petraea was established from the three parental maps available for this species. it includes  <dig> markers  and spans  <dig> cm . lg sizes varied from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig> cm  for q .robur and from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig> cm  for q. petraea. mean lg length was  <dig> cm for q. robur and  <dig> cm for q. petraea. the mean spacing between markers was  <dig>  cm, with values ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm .

the consensus species maps were compared for the analysis of genomic organization and structural rearrangements. a high degree of macrocollinearity was observed between the two maps, based on  <dig> common markers evenly distributed over the  <dig> lgs . some order discrepancies occurred in small sections of lgs, as in lg <dig> and lg <dig>  for example. furthermore, the positions of a few markers were inconsistent over larger distances. for example, got <dig> was localized to the top of lg <dig> for q. petraea but was found in the center of this lg in q. robur. it should also be noted that lg <dig> was split into two parts in q. petraea.

transferability of est-ssrs to other members of the fagaceae and nothofagaceae and comparative mapping of quercus and castanea
transferability of est-ssrs
we assessed the transferability of  <dig> est-ssr markers to q. ilex and q. suber, of  <dig> markers to c. sativa and f. sylvatica, and  <dig> markers to n. pumilio and n. antarctica . a pcr product of the expected size was amplified in at least one of the fagaceae or nothofagaceae species for  <dig> %  of the est-ssrs tested. within the fagaceae family, transferability was greatest for the two white oaks , with transferability rates close to 100% . transferability was intermediate for q. suber, q. ilex and c. sativa, with rates of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 68% respectively. the lowest transferability within the fagaceae family was observed in fagus sylvatica, with only  <dig> % of transferable markers. levels of transferability to nothofagaceae species were very low. only  <dig> and  <dig> markers were successfully transferred to n. pumilio and n. antarctica, respectively.

comparative mapping
we mapped  <dig> polymorphic markers in castanea ,  <dig> of which were common  to the consensus quercus map. for all  <dig> castanea lgs , homologous linkage groups were identified in quercus , with four to  <dig> markers shared for lg4-c  and lg1-c , respectively . a set of  <dig> markers was located on linkage groups that were not homologous between castanea and quercus. overall, macrosynteny was well conserved between the two genera, despite the inversion of a few markers .

diversity analysis
a high-quality amplification product was obtained for  <dig> %  of the  <dig> markers studied in the first experiment and  <dig> %  were found to be polymorphic in at least one natural population of q. robur and q. petraea. in the two populations considered, expected heterozygosity  ranged from low  to high  values. diversity levels  were similar in the two species.

diversity levels were rather similar in the two sub-mediterranean quercus species . all diversity estimates were largest for est-ssrs with dinucleotide repeat motifs. however, differences were small between tri and hexanucleotide est-ssrs in these two oaks. the same trend was observed for q. robur and q. petraea.

oak genome evolution
construction of a gene-based consensus linkage map
individual maps were constructed from est-ssrs  and snps. for snp-based markers,  <dig>  and  <dig>  candidate genes were genotyped in three mapping populations:  <dig>  and  <dig>  were localized on at least one of the six parental maps . the consensus map included  <dig> loci ,  <dig> of which  were considered to be paralogous and were assigned to different bins  on different individual maps. the mean number of markers mapped per lg was  <dig>  with a maximum of  <dig> markers mapped for lg <dig> and a minimum of  <dig> for lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig>  markers were assigned to 86- <dig> cm bins within each of the  <dig> linkage groups of the consensus map, for the identification of regions orthologous to regions from arabidopsis, grape, poplar, medicago, and soybean.

synteny and duplication analysis
independent intraspecific  and interspecific  comparisons are required for the precise inference of paralogous or orthologous gene relationships between oak and other eudicots and to determine the precise history of oak evolution from the known ancestor of eudicot genomes.

using the alignment parameters and statistical tests described in the methods section, we analyzed the syntenic relationships between oak, arabidopsis, poplar, medicago, grape and soybean  <cit> . using grape as the reference genome — this species being the closest relative of the eudicot ancestor, with a genome structured into seven protochromosomes  — <dig> orthologous relationships were identified  covering 50% of the oak genome  <cit> . the following chromosome-to-chromosome relationships were then established : o1/g <dig>  o2/g4-g11-g <dig>  o3/g <dig>  o5/g12-g <dig>  o6/g4-g <dig>  o7/g <dig>  o8/g6-g10-g12-g <dig>  o10/g <dig>  o11/g <dig>  o12/g2-g <dig> 

five major duplications were also identified, covering 28% of the genome and involving the following chromosome-to-chromosome relationships: o1-o2-o <dig> , o6-o <dig> , o3-o <dig> , o7-o <dig> , o5-o <dig>  .

discussion
our results provide new biological information about certain features of oak est-ssrs, the benefits of linkage mapping with multiple pedigrees, the macrosynteny between two interfertile oak species  and between two closely related genera , and about the evolution of the oak genome from the ancestor of the eudicot genome.

characteristics of oak est-ssrs
as reported in other species  <cit> ,  <cit> , dinucleotide-ssrs  occurred preferentially within utr regions, whereas trinucleotide-ssrs  that do not interfere with the reading frame occurred mostly in the coding regions of oak ests. the rate of polymorphism was also higher for di-ssr loci than for tri-ssr loci ), suggesting that ssrs occurring within utrs are more polymorphic than those in coding regions. the number of alleles was also larger for di-ssr loci than for tri-ssr loci . a similar pattern has been reported for other species, such as castor bean  <cit>  and cotton  <cit> .

est-ssrs were highly transferable between fagaceae species, consistent with findings for other dicots, such as prunus <cit> , camellia <cit> , citrus <cit>  and other species , demonstrating a higher degree of transferability across taxonomic boundaries for est-ssr markers than for genomic ssrs  <cit> . as expected, the transferability of quercus est-ssrs decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance between the species concerned. furthermore, more than 75% of est-ssr markers displayed high levels of genetic diversity in natural populations of q. robur and q. petraea. thus, est-ssr loci can generate sufficient polymorphism to constitute a valuable source of functional ssr markers for population genetic studies within the fagaceae. as a proof of concept, we used two other quercus species  to provide the foundations for the use of a set of est-ssr markers for comparative population genetic studies of the almost  <dig> species of deciduous oaks in the mediterranean region. the high transferability rates into such species and the elevated polymorphims grant the use of our set of est-ssrs for such purposes.

linkage mapping with multiple pedigrees
mapping based on multiple segregating populations has several advantages over mapping based on a single pedigree. first, such strategies make it possible to map much larger numbers of markers. in this study,  <dig> loci were mapped in the most polymorphic mapping population , but the analysis of four more pedigrees made it possible to map another  <dig> loci. the l-shaped distribution of the number of markers common to the different populations  clearly demonstrates that the number of polymorphic markers suitable for mapping increases with the number of pedigrees considered. a consensus map for oak is currently being constructed on a much larger scale, with snp-based markers genotyped in four oak pedigrees with a total of  <dig>  offspring. the addition of several thousand gene-based markers will provide a valuable tool for the alignment of genomic scaffolds from the oak genome  with a linkage map, with a view to establishing pseudochromosomes.

second, based on comparisons of the positions of the mapped markers in the various populations, we identified  <dig> loci  with different linkage group positions in different populations , suggesting that different paralogs were indeed amplified in different genetic backgrounds, probably due to nucleotide variability at priming sites. in most cases, the discrepancies observed concerned parental maps for different pedigrees, but no such trend was identified concerning the species origin of the paralogous loci. interestingly, eight of the  <dig> annotated sequences corresponding to proteins of known function belong to multiple gene families .

finally, the establishment of linkage maps for multiple pedigrees within a species is also a prerequisite for multiple pedigree-based qtl detection strategies aiming to identify and validate qtls in a broad genetic background  <cit> . to this end, a total of  <dig> est-ssrs evenly spaced and common to the six parental maps of p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> have been chosen and will be genotyped in  <dig> to  <dig> f1s for the identification of qtls for adaptive traits .

comparative mapping of oak species that hybridize naturally: q. robur and q. petraea, and beyond
we present here the first genetic maps for two interfertile white oak species, making it possible to trace chromosomal changes  <cit> . a relatively large proportion  of the loci mapped was common to at least two parental maps. the integrated species maps of  <dig> loci covered all  <dig> lgs, with a mean distance between markers of  <dig>  cm for q. robur and  <dig>  cm for q. petraea. as expected, the total length of the integrated maps was greater than the length of the individual maps, as previously reported for vitis <cit> , lactuca <cit>  and picea <cit> . these results suggest that integrated maps probably cover regions not covered by the individual maps, in distal positions on the chromosomes. the genome lengths of the two consensus maps were very different —  <dig> cm for q. robur and  <dig> cm for q. petraea — despite the similar physical size of the two genomes  <cit> . this discrepancy may reflect differences in recombination rates between q. robur and q. petraea or differences in recombination rate in these particular genotypes. the overall macrocollinearity between these two species maps was high, with little shuffling of marker order between homologous lgs. some local inconsistencies in marker order were observed, as reported for other species  <cit> , but no duplication or major chromosomal rearrangement  was characterized. this high degree of collinearity should facilitate the identification of genomic islands involved in species differentiation  <cit> .

a comparison of the consensus maps of quercus and castanea revealed a high degree of collinearity and synteny between the  <dig> homologous linkage groups, despite the divergence of their lineages  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . a search for genes underlying similar qtls, based on comparative mapping, could be considered, making use of the sequencing data available for castanea.

oak genome evolution
we have identified precise chromosomal relationships within the oak genome corresponding to the ancestral hexaploidization event reported in eudicots  <cit> . this made it possible to propose an evolutionary scenario describing the development of the modern oak genome from the ancestral eudicot karyotype over the last  <dig> million years. such information is of prime importance for gene cloning and, for example, detecting gene function by complementing arabidopsis mutants. the ancestral hexaploidization event in eudicots generated two additional copies for any ancestral gene function considered  <cit> . in modern eudicot species, these three homologous copies may have or may not have retained the same function as the ancestral gene. it is thus of the utmost importance, when cloning candidate genes on the basis of synteny  genomes), to investigate all the duplicated copies, which may prove to be redundant or complementary in terms of their function and the phenotype they confer  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides new insights into the distribution of est-derived ssrs between five mapping populations of two oak species and the benefits of using multiple pedigrees for the construction of consensus maps. we mapped  <dig> loci, 81% of which were common to at least two different mapping populations. the level of conserved macrosynteny was very high between q. robur and q. petraea, as well as between quercus spp. and castanea sativa, opening perspectives for qtl validation across phylogenetically related species as demonstrated by faivre rampant et al.  <cit> .

functional characterization of these est-derived oak ssrs revealed many genes with biological, cellular and molecular functions. their position is now being compared to that of already mapped qtls and suggest putative positional candidate genes that are being used as anchor markers to fine map large effect qtls  and identify the underlying sub genomic region using the bac libraries available for quercus robur <cit> .
