BACKGROUND
the genus cronobacter, member of the family enterobacteriaceae, comprises seven species – c. sakazakii, c. turicensis, c. malonaticus, c. muytjensii, c. dublinensis, c. universalis and c. condimenti <cit> . they are opportunistic pathogens that can cause septicaemia and infections of the central nervous system primarily in premature, low-birth weight and/or immune-compromised neonates  <cit> . most outbreaks have been reported in neonatal intensive care units where the sources of infection have been traced to cronobacter spp. contaminated, reconstituted powdered infant formula  and/or feeding equipment.

as a foodborne pathogen causing systemic infections, cronobacter spp. must cross the gastrointestinal barrier and, following their tropism for the central nervous system, translocate to and cross the blood–brain barrier . in that context, it is expected that cronobacter spp. express virulence factors that help in colonization and invasion of mucosal cells  <cit>  as well as effectors that confer the ability of cronobacter spp. to overcome the mechanisms of killing by serum components and/or the human complement system  <cit> .

microbes that cause invasive infections have evolved strategies to protect themselves against the bactericidal action of the serum/complement. structures of the bacterial cell surface, such as capsules, lps and outer-membrane proteins have been identified as being responsible for the complement resistance of bacteria  <cit> . for cronobacter spp. it has been shown, that the outer membrane protein omp a contributes significantly to the survival of the bacteria in the blood  <cit> .

in a more recent study an outer membrane protease cpa has been identified as a factor that activates plasminogen, thus mediating serum resistance in c. sakazakii <cit> . however, it has been demonstrated, that there is a considerable degree of variation among cronobacter spp. isolates with respect to their ability to resist serum complement  <cit> . in a pilot study a set of cronobacter isolates  from various origins  was tested for their capacity to survive in human blood and the clinical isolate cronobacter sakazakii es <dig> was identified as the most tolerant strain  among the cronobacter sakazakii isolates tested .

this strain was selected for further experiments aiming for the identification and analysis of genes involved in this feature.

RESULTS
identification of genes involved in modified serum tolerance in c. sakazakii
screening of  <dig> random mutants from a c. sakazakii es <dig> tn <dig> library for modified serum tolerance revealed  <dig> candidates for which a significantly increased/reduced tolerance to serum killing  was confirmed. in figure  <dig> the variations in the survival of the mutants expressed as log variation  over time  is depicted. serum sensitivity was expressed in log variations  for  <dig> and 120 min / the number of cfu ml- <dig> of non- serum exposed inoculum . by referring the counts after incubation to t <dig>  the inoculum variations were corrected for all experiments.

only mutants for which a single transposon insertion in the chromosome was confirmed were subjected to the subsequent mapping experiments. the sequences obtained were subjected to similarity searches at the ncbi website.

c this study.

identification of the respective mutated sites from mutants displaying reduced serum resistance included genes coding for surface and membrane proteins ,  regulatory genes  as well as a dnaj domain containing protein . mutant 67_ <dig> represents a knock out in the igaa coding gene. this non-pigmented mutant has been identified in the study by johler et al.  but was not subject of further investigation in this study  <cit> . however, this protein was identified in salmonella typhimurium as a membrane protein that attenuates the response of the rcscdb signalling system to environmental stress. the rcs two component system is known to be involved in the  regulation of a number of target genes including biofilm formation and pathogenicity. thus, it has been reported, that the constitutive activation of this system dramatically attenuates salmonella virulence  <cit> .

mutant bf <dig> was originally described in the study by hartmann et al.  where it was found to produce less biofilm on polystyrene  <cit> . the transposon insertion affected a site with 100% homology to the locus esa_ <dig> of the c. sakazakii atcc baa  <dig> genome  to which the annotation hypothetical protein was available at that time. however, blastx analysis of the respective protein reveals homology to proteins containing a conserved wzy_c superfamily domain. the coding region for this protein must not be confused with the gene for the wzy protein which is part of the o- antigen gene locus  located between esa_ <dig> and esa_ <dig> the function of which is annotated as o-antigen polymerase. the o-antigen forms part of the lipopolysaccharide  in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and is one of the most variable constituents on the cell surface. there are currently seven  different o-antigen serotypes described for c. sakazakii and the putative organization of the genes included in the different clusters has been published recently  <cit> . as in one of these serotypes , the wzy gene does not seem to be part of the cluster it has been proposed, that a different, yet unknown gene mapping elsewhere in the chromosome may code for this essential function and we further hypothesized that the esa_ <dig> coding region may have been a candidate for this. however, determination of the o-antigen serotype of the c. sakazakii es <dig> strain by application of a recently developed pcr based serotyping scheme  <cit>  revealed that this strain belongs to the o <dig> serotype .

as to date there is no experimental data on the involvement of the esa_ <dig> coding region in serum tolerance available, we aimed to investigate whether an intact copy of the esa_ <dig> gene provided in trans to the esa_ <dig> deleted mutant bf <dig> would restore the serum tolerance to wild type level. therefore this gene including its putative native promoter region was cloned onto a low copy expression vector and the resulting construct was transformed into bf <dig> mutant. serum sensitivity tests were performed using the c. sakazakii es <dig> wt strain, the bf <dig>  mutant, the bf <dig>  mutant containing an empty pccr <dig> vector  and the complemented mutant bf4_pccr9::esa_ <dig>  the results of these experiments are depicted in figure  <dig>  an inactivation around  <dig> log during incubation in 50% human serum for 120 min was observed in the bf <dig>  mutant as well as the mutant containing the low copy vector pccr <dig>  whereas the survival of the mutant with supplied vector pccr <dig> and esa_ <dig> was restored to  <dig> log reduction cfu ml- <dig> compared to t <dig> compared to the wt with  <dig>  log reduction. we could, however, not completely restore the serum survival to wild type levels in the complemented mutant. this may be explained  by the unknown copy number of the mrna for this gene in the wild type during incubation in serum and/or by possible polar effects.

mutant 69_f <dig> was identified to be affected in a gene coding for a dnaj domain family protein. members of this family are essential for their interaction with dnak chaperone and activation of its atpase activity. in edwardsiella tarda it was recently demonstrated that dnaj and dnak play a crucial role in general bacterial virulence, in blood dissemination capacity  <cit> .

interestingly, by using the tn <dig> approach we found an equally high number of knock out mutants, that showed an enhanced survival in human serum compared to the wild type. one of the obvious possibilities to explain this phenomenon would be the knock out of regulatory elements  which would lead to a subsequent activation/constitutive expression of the respective phenotype. mutant 24_h <dig>  may fall into this category. the region affected by the transposon in this mutant shows homology to the ribonuclease regulator protein rraa. this protein acts as an inhibitor of the essential endoribonuclease rnase e, which itself plays a crucial role in global mrna metabolism as well as in the maturation of functional rnas such as rrnas, trnas, tmrna, and small regulatory rnas  <cit> . however, lee et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that ectopic expression of rraa itself affects the abundance of more than  <dig> transcripts in escherichia coli, thus making it difficult to hypothesize upon the influence of the knock out of this gene on the enhanced survival of the mutant in human serum.

more surprising was the finding that deletions in genes putatively coding for chaperones lead to an enhanced survival in human serum. one of those, namely 4_g <dig> , is a member of the j-domain protein family. djla can substitute for dnaj co-chaperone  <cit>  and seems to have multiple functions. however, it has also been described that djla negatively regulates the response of the two component rcscdb signaling system to envelope stress. the rcs signal transduction system positively regulates the expression of many different genes among those are the ones forming the capsular polysaccharide synthesis operon  <cit> . the expression of capsules may provide protection from serum killing components . in a study by shiba et al.  <cit>  it was demonstrated that djla deletion resulted in increased activation of the rcs system. this might positively regulate cps transcription.

mutant 21_g <dig>  exhibiting an enhanced serum tolerance was shown to be affected in a gene coding for the ybaj protein. it has been proposed that ybaj and its adjacent protein hha may form a so called toxin-antitoxin pair where ybaj  negatively regulates the expression of hha , the latter one  serving as a repressor for type  <dig> fimbriae  <cit> . type  <dig> fimbriae are highly immunogenic, thus a strain not expressing these structures may have an advantage in survival during exposure in human serum  <cit> .

in the present study we further examined the hypothesis that the disruption of the regulatory gene ybaj may lead to an activation of the hha protein which in turn would negatively influence transcription of the key fimbrial structural gene fima. rt-qpcr experiments were performed in order to quantify hha and fima mrna levels in the c. sakazakii es <dig> wt and mutant 21_g <dig> strains, before and after exposure to human serum. the levels of fima mrna were more than  <dig>  log lower in the mutant 21_g <dig> strain compared to the c. sakazakii es <dig> wt strain. the hha mrna levels were for the mutant compared to the wt  <dig> log lower and not like expected higher, suggesting that the deletion of the ybaj gene did not result directly in a de-repression/ activation of the hha gene in our experimental set up . our results rather suggest that ybaj itself may be involved in the regulation/activation of the expression of the type  <dig> fimbriae in c. sakazakii.

CONCLUSIONS
by using a transposon knock out approach we were able to identify structural and regulatory genes in cronobacter sakazakii es <dig>  deletion of which resulted in a dramatically reduced capability to survive in serum. additionally, several mutants were found displaying an enhanced survival in serum as compared to the wild type. analysis of the genetic elements possibly responsible for this phenotype revealed genes coding for chaperone-like proteins, regulatory  elements as well as genes for structures or components representing immunogenic targets. the deletion of the ybaj element which is part of the antitoxin-toxin pair ybaj-hha resulted in an abolished expression of a key element of the type  <dig> fimbriae. the absence of the latter most likely accounted for the enhanced survival of this mutant in human serum.
