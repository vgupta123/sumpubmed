BACKGROUND
the origin of the fundamental rules governing metazoan multicellularity and morphological complexity can be gleaned through the analysis of the genomes of early branching animals   <cit>  and their closely related unicellular holozoans   <cit> . comparative analysis of these genomes has shed light into the evolution of protein-coding gene families. for instance, transcription factor and signalling pathway gene families that are essential to the development of complex bilaterians  largely evolved in the precambrian, before the lineage leading to these animals diverged from early branching animal phyla  <cit> .

obtaining a more complete picture of the origin and early evolution of metazoan multicellularity and development also requires the analysis of the mechanisms that regulate gene expression. this demands  a more precise view of genome organisation and composition, and gene structure,  detailed expression profiles from multiple cell types, and developmental and physiological contexts, and  the capacity to experimentally manipulate gene function. thus, increasing the accuracy and completeness of the draft genomes of early branching metazoans is an important step in improving their utility for future evolutionary and functional studies aimed at unravelling the origin of animal multicellularity.

the genome of the demosponge amphimedon queenslandica was published in  <dig>  <cit>  and is currently the only published genome from phylum porifera. the sponge body plan is amongst the simplest in the animal kingdom. it lacks nerve and muscle cells and a centralised gut . porifera is traditionally regarded as the oldest surviving phyletic lineage of animals. however, as recent molecular phylogenomic and phylogenetic analyses both support  <cit>  and reject  <cit>  this traditional view, it remains unclear as to whether sponges or ctenophores are the sister group to all other animals and whether poriferans are monophyletic. thus, interpretations of the sponge body plan in the context of metazoan evolution range from it representing a state similar to the last common ancestor of modern animals to it being derived from a morphologically more complex ancestor that possessed a gut, nerves and muscles.

here we have improved the gene annotations in the draft genome of amphimedon by combining deep transcriptome data from four developmental stages with previously generated developmental ests and cel-seq – a single cell rna-seq method  <cit>  - evidence across  <dig> sponge developmental samples, from early cleavage through metamorphosis  <cit> . the inclusion of these transcriptomes markedly improves the current amphimedon protein-coding gene models, which were primarily based on ab initio predictions and low-throughput est evidence, and increases the total number of protein-coding genes in the genome by 25%. furthermore, analysis of transcripts across sponge development has for the first time revealed alternative splicing patterns in a sponge, which are more similar to those reported in yeast than to those described in eumetazoans.

RESULTS
evidence-based protein-coding gene annotation
we sequenced and assembled de novo a. queenslandica polyadenylated rnas present in adult, juvenile, competent and pre-competent larval stages in a strand-specific manner using trinity  <cit> . to help detect low-abundance transcripts we also sequenced an adult sponge sample at high-depth in an unstranded manner and assembled it de novo with trinity  <cit>  . all strand-specific transcripts were combined with  <dig>  previously assembled est contigs from larval stages  <cit>  using pasa  <cit> . the best open reading frames  were predicted from the representative transcripts generated by pasa . to better resolve a. queenslandica gene families characterized by complex and highly repetitive regions that trinity might assemble incorrectly  gene family  <cit> ), an independent genome-guided assembly for each developmental stage was generated using cufflinks  <cit> . only cufflinks transcripts found in at least two developmental stages were used as additional evidence for gene annotation .table  <dig>

de novo and genome-based assembled transcripts, predicted orfs and the previously generated ab initio gene models  <cit>  were combined using evm  <cit>  to predict protein-coding gene models. untranslated regions  were added to these evm gene models by two successive rounds of pasa using all developmental stranded trinity transcripts and ests .

the completed set of amphimedon genes - aqu <dig> - contains a total of  <dig>  transcripts, which includes alternatively spliced gene isoforms expressed in different developmental stages . to reduce isoform redundancy we identified each gene’s isoform with the longest orf , resulting in  <dig>  protein-coding loci in the final aqu <dig> gene annotation. finally, deep 3’ end-biased cel-seq  <cit>  expression data spanning  <dig> a. queenslandica developmental samples  <cit>  were used to refine the 3’ ends of aqu <dig> gene models, resulting in the extension of the 3’ ends of  <dig>  genes .

currently, the main amphimedon gene annotation resource available to the community is aqu <dig>  aqu <dig> has  <dig>  genes and was released along with the original report of the amphimedon genome  <cit>  . additionally, ncbi generated a limited set of predicted genes via their automated pipeline upon genome submission, resulting in  <dig>  protein-coding gene predictions. to assess the gene annotation improvements, aqu <dig> was compared with these gene annotations and previously generated ab initio gene model predictions  <cit>  .table  <dig>

 <dig>   aqu <dig> models share at least 80% identity with aqu <dig> models, with many of the revised genes having a different structure  or length .  <dig>  aqu <dig> gene models are not supported at all in the aqu <dig> annotation. also  <dig>   of ab initio and  <dig>   of ncbi annotated genes are included in aqu <dig>  some ncbi models are fragmented into smaller gene models resulting in  <dig>  aqu <dig> models from  <dig>  ncbi models . in contrast, many adjacent ab initio models have been merged resulting in  <dig>  aqu <dig> models from  <dig>  ab initio models .

aqu <dig> covers  <dig> % more of the current a. queenslandica genome  and includes  <dig>  newly annotated exons, with  <dig>  of the previous aqu <dig> models having additional exons in their corresponding aqu <dig> models . there is also a marked increase in the number of 3’ and 5’ untranslated regions  . the use of cel-seq 3’ end evidence results in an increase from  <dig>  to  <dig>  annotated 3’ utrs  in aqu <dig>  while 5’ utrs only increase from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .figure  <dig> improvement in amphimedon queenslandica gene annotations. a) increase in the number of exons  per gene  between aqu <dig>  and aqu <dig>  for all genes with less than  <dig> exons. b) increase in the number  and size of coding  and non-coding  transcript regions  between aqu <dig>  and aqu <dig> . the transcript region size is displayed in log-scale. c) genome browser example of improvements in gene annotations between ab initio , aqu <dig> , evm models with annotated utrs  and aqu <dig> . the gene on the right side of the panel is gata and the one on the left has no significant match in other organisms. thick blocks represent coding exons, thin blocks non-coding exons and lines introns. small arrows on introns denote the direction of transcription. scaffold number and position, and scale bar shown on top. d) distribution of the intergenic distance between annotated genes of amphimedon queenslandica  displayed in log-scale. the median intergenic distance  is shown as a vertical line .



a comparison of the protein best blast hit  of aqu <dig> and aqu <dig> gene models against the swissprot database reveals that aqu <dig> and aqu <dig> have a similar number of bbh to metazoan proteins, with slightly fewer matches in aqu <dig> . in contrast, aqu <dig> has more unique coding sequences  with identifiable pfam domains proteins  compared than aqu <dig>  , potentially expanding the list of lineage-restricted genes. finally, there are  <dig>  unannotated genes in aqu <dig> compared to  <dig>  in aqu <dig>  which will require further verification to establish if they are present in other basal metazoans, unique to poriferans, or restricted to demosponges.

improvements in aqu <dig> are exemplified in the locus depicted in figure 2c, which shows the gene encoding the developmental transcription factor gata  <cit> , and a previously unannotated gene transcribed in the opposite direction from a putative bidirectional promoter. this gene was missing from the previous annotation  although it was predicted by ab initio methods . in aqu <dig> both genes have annotated 3’ and 5’ utrs; cel-seq data further extend both the 3’ ends. the significant increase in gene model number and length results in a more gene dense genome with a decrease of the median intergenic distance from  <dig> to 587 bp .

identification of previously unannotated protein-coding genes
although aqu <dig> represents a more complete picture of the genes present in the amphimedon, we find most improvements in conserved gene families are minor and are generally restricted to more accurate assignment of exons and untranslated regions. however there are a few notable exceptions. for instance, we identified a number of new transcription factors, including the aristaless homeobox  gene, which, in spite of having been previously identified by larroux et al.  <cit>  was missing from the aqu <dig> annotation. in this case, the 5’ end of the corresponding aqu <dig> model is discarded in aqu <dig> and the 3’ end extended. the discarded 5’ end encodes the splicing factor 3b subunit and now comprises the adjacent gene. aqu <dig> also includes a new member of the pou transcription factor gene family and previously unannotated genes encoding neuronal proteins including the synapse differentiation-induced protein1-like , a gene expressed in the caudal and putamen brain regions of mouse and human, and a new version of cpeb, a protein involved in memory maintenance  <cit>  .

amphimedon possesses both conserved and novel transcription termination elements
we identified motifs enriched in  <dig>  strict 3’ utrs that are now annotated in amphimedon. there are four long at-rich motifs that are overrepresented in this region, three of which sit between  <dig> and 60 bp upstream of the transcription termination site  . these motifs are more abundant than the polyadenylation signal sequence  consensus sequence , which is found adjacent to and preceding the tts . one of the identified motifs - motif  <dig> - is a composite version of the polya signal  that, as expected, overlaps with the canonical pas sequence .figure  <dig> transcription termination elements overrepresented in amphimedon queenslandica 3’ utrs. a) frequency per 20 bp bin  of enriched motifs in mrna 3’ ends signals  <dig>  bp around the transcription termination site , including the consensus polyadenylation signal  awuaaa . motif numbers correspond to those in panel b and relate to the motif ranking found by meme. the most prevalent position of novel motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is highlighted in the grey shaded area . b) sequence logo, number of occurrences and significance for four at-rich motifs enriched before the canonical polyadenylation signal . the significance value is the e-value of the log likelihood ratio of each motif, while the number of sites per class shows the number of 3’ utrs out of a total of  <dig>  strict 3’ utrs that had a particular motif. c) cumulative frequency of the pas consensus sequence  500 bp upstream  or downstream  of a set of strict transcription start sites  on scaffolds longer than 50 kb and not overlapping with other tsss.



comparison of the cumulative frequency of the consensus pas relative to the transcription start site  reveals pass accumulate more rapidly upstream than downstream of a set of  <dig>  strict tsss . this pattern of a lower frequency of pass on the coding strand is consistent with pas being associated with transcription termination in a. queenslandica  <cit> .

alternative splicing is dominated by intron retention
a conservative estimate of alternative splicing  in a. queenslandica was obtained by considering only as events supported by at least three different assembled transcripts . only as events resulting in the acquisition of an alternative first or last exon were lowly supported, with 98% of these appearing, at most, in two different assembled transcripts .

based on these conservative estimates, alternative splicing in a. queenslandica appears to be less prevalent than in many eumetazoans  <cit> , with less than 32% of the total transcripts detected in this study being generated by some form of as . the large majority of as events result in the retention of an intron, constituting 45% of all alternative splicing events and  <dig> % of all alternatively spliced transcripts . the second most abundant splicing event results in the incorporation of an alternative terminal exon , followed by alternative splice acceptor  and donor  .figure  <dig> alternative splicing in amphimedon queenslandica. a) graphical depiction of as event classes in relation to the canonically spliced isoform . from top to bottom: intron retention , alternative terminal exon , alternative acceptor , alternative donor , exon-skipping , intron end  and intron start . the number of transcripts in each class of as is shown in the second column and the percentage of all transcripts this represents is shown in parentheses. the total percentage is over 100% as different types of as sometimes occur in the same transcript. b) pie chart showing percentage of as events belonging to the classes shown in panel a. c) number of transcripts  and percentage  of transcripts with as events  exemplified in panel a. similar to panel a, the total percentage is over 100% as different types of as events can occur in the same transcript. colour coding and abbreviations in b and c are identical to those used in panel a.

discussion
the use of high-coverage developmental transcriptomes has markedly improved the gene annotations in the amphimedon queenslandica genome, resulting in the refinement of existing gene models and the identification of a large number of previously unannotated genes. given the high density of genes in the amphimedon genome, the use of stranded rna-seq was proved essential for accurate gene identification and gene model prediction. the integration of cel-seq data from  <dig> developmental samples, spanning from early cleavage through metamorphosis into the juvenile form, further improves the gene models by  allowing 3’ utrs to be extended to regions that have cel-seq sequence support and  confirming the developmental expression of new gene models.

combining stranded-rna seq and cel-seq data with existing gene models via a pipeline that relies both on de novo and genome-informed assemblies significantly improves the accuracy of existing gene models. improvements include the addition or extension of 3’ and 5’ utrs, the identification of missing exons, the removal of incorrectly predicted exons and the refinement of exon/intron boundaries. the high level of transcriptome coverage identified genes not included in previous annotations. this approach also has allowed us to identify gene models that were previously fused or fragmented in aqu <dig>  although aqu <dig> is primarily based on transcriptome evidence, both aqu <dig> and aqu <dig> show similar coverage of metazoan orthologues and support the expression of conserved metazoan proteins during amphimedon development.

a number of biological observations emerge from these new gene annotations. first, the increase in the number of protein-coding genes in the amphimedon genome has led to the expansion of some gene families, including those encoding developmental transcription factors, such as arx and pou, and proteins involved in neuron functioning, such as capucin and cpeb. it is worth noting that although the aqu <dig> models have led to a better annotation of metazoan gene families, most conserved gene families were accurately annotated in aqu <dig> 

second, the more accurate annotation of untranslated regions in aqu <dig> allows for the identification to transcription start and termination sites. genomic sequences in the vicinity of these sites contribute to the regulation of gene transcription and transcript termination and stability. core transcriptional elements overlap with tsss  <cit>  and pass and other motifs in the 3’ utr control transcript termination, stability and localisation  <cit> . analysis of the 3’ utrs in amphimedon reveals the enrichment of a number of at-rich motifs 60–100 bp upstream of tts. these currently appear to be unique to amphimedon. further, as observed in vertebrates  <cit> , analysis of the frequency of pas sequences upstream and downstream of putative tsss in amphimedon reveals a disproportionate depletion of pass in the direction of transcription compared to in the opposite non-coding direction. this is consistent with pas signals participating in transcription termination in amphimedon.

third, the extension of existing genes and the annotation of new genes both have contributed to an overall increase in gene density. indeed, the amphimedon genome is the most gene dense animal genome currently known  <cit> . in addition to having minimal intergenic spacing , intron size in amphimedon is markedly smaller than other animals . both intergenic and intron size in amphimedon are more similar to non-metazoan opisthokonts  <cit> . given the basal position of poriferans, these characteristics suggest sponges may have retained genomic features of the first metazoans. although protein-coding gene content in sponges includes many metazoan innovations  <cit> , their genome organisation and gene structure appears to be more similar to simple unicellular ophistokonts.

fourth and consistent with the above observation, the level and modes of alternative splicing in amphimedon is more akin to those found in yeast than in other animals. this sponge has lower proportion of alternative splicing events compared to other animals, particularly those that result in exon-skipping and gene product diversification. these very low levels of exon-skipping are similar to those observed in yeast  <cit>  and in contrast to bilaterians, where exon-skipping is often the most prevalent form of as  <cit> . as an increase in average intron size correlates with increased levels of exon-skipping  <cit> , the limited exon-skipping and small intron size in amphimedon are consistent with these genomic features and processes emerging later in eumetazoan evolution, after the divergence of this and the sponge lineage.

fifth, the new aqu <dig> models greatly expand the number of gene models without orthologues to over  <dig> . nearly all these genes are developmentally expressed based on rna-seq and cel-seq data. with a paucity of whole genome data from phylum porifera it is currently difficult to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in improving the accuracy of the amphimedon gene models we have increased the number of full-length genes with accurate transcription start and termination sites. this allows for the future identification and analysis of promoters and other regulatory sequences populating intergenic dna and utrs. combined with experimental manipulation and a detailed analysis of gene expression, the analysis of cis-regulatory dna provides a means to understand the logic underlying sponge morphogenesis and cell specification and differentiation. when placed in a comparative framework, this knowledge informs our understanding of the evolution of the cell types  <cit>  and developmental mechanisms underpinning metazoan body plans.
