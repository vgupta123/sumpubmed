BACKGROUND
alternative splicing and transcriptional initiation are key mechanisms, which generate diversity both at the mrna and protein levels. recently, several independent research efforts revealed that more than 90% of human genes are alternatively spliced  <cit> , and about 50% of both human and mouse genes have multiple alternative promoters  <cit> . additionally, a genome-wide screening of alternative splicing and transcriptional initiation estimated that a significant number of genes are differentially spliced within 5' and 3' untranslated regions   <cit> . moreover, another genome-wide analysis identified  <dig> out of  <dig> genes that display associations between flanking single nucleotide polymorphisms  and gene expression/alternative transcription, demonstrating the regulatory effects of genetic variation in human populations  <cit> . these non-bias/genome-wide analyses highlight the importance of alternative splicing/promoter usage as general mechanisms of regulation control in mammalian cells.

utrs are considered to influence gene expression by modulating mrna stability and/or translational efficiency. consequently, utr heterogeneity for a specific gene is likely to have a differential impact on protein expression  <cit> . analysis of variable 5' utrs in the tgf-beta, brca <dig> and mdm <dig> genes, have indicated that the shorter utr variants are translated more efficiently  <cit> .

the hedgehog  signaling pathway plays a central role in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis  <cit> . abnormal activation of the pathway has been associated with various cancers in skin, brain, lung, digestive tract, prostate and pancreas  <cit> . the mechanistic details of the hh signaling pathway, which is generally thought to be well conserved in evolution, have mostly emerged from studies in drosophila. in the absence of hh ligands, the ptch receptor inhibits the activity of the 7-pass transmembrane protein smoothened , which acts as a positive regulator of the pathway. interaction of hh ligands with ptch relieves the inhibitory control of ptch on smo, allowing the gli transcription factor to dissociate from the negative regulator suppressor of fused  and translocate into the nucleus, activating target genes. in mammals there are three paralogues of hh proteins, sonic hh, indian hh and desert hh, two ptch receptors, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig>  and three gli transcription factors, gli <dig>  gli <dig> and gli <dig>  additionally, splice variants of several hh signaling components have been identified  <cit> , in line with an earlier report, which, by the use of genome-wide rnai, highlighted the importance of alternative splicing in this pathway  <cit> .

gli <dig> was originally identified as a highly expressed gene in human glioma  <cit>  and acts as a downstream effector of the hh signaling cascade, mediating the transcriptional response  <cit> . gli <dig> is also a target gene of the hh pathway, resulting in a positive feedback loop. moreover, overexpression of gli <dig> in transgenic mice leads to the induction of basal cell carcinomas and trichoepitheliomas  <cit> . alternative splicing in the gli <dig> 5' utr regions of human and mouse has earlier been reported by wang and rothnagel  <cit> . recently, we and others have demonstrated the occurrence of functional, differential splicing events in the coding regions of human gli <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, novel mouse gli <dig> mrna variants, whose transcriptional initiation is further upstream of the reported exon  <dig> sequence, were identified. additionally, we obtained evidence that genetic variation is a key determining factor for the alternative splicing events in the gli <dig> 5' utrs, which have functional implications on translational efficiency.

RESULTS
identification of novel transcription start sites in the mouse gli <dig> gene
in a previous report, we have shown the presence of novel human gli <dig> splice variants, which skip exons  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, wang and rothnagel had earlier reported the skipping of exon 1a and/or exon 1b in mouse gli <dig>  <cit> . to clarify the splicing pattern of the mouse gli <dig> gene at its 5' end, rapid amplificaton of cdna ends  analysis using reverse primers within exon  <dig>  was performed on rna extracted from nih3t <dig> cells. surprisingly, we did not detect any race product below the expected size of a transcript that includes exon  <dig>  1a, 1b,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . on the contrary, the major products observed were significantly longer. this finding implies the presence of other exon and/or the extension of known exons. sequence-verification of the race products demonstrated the existence of novel transcriptional start sites  for exon  <dig>  which are located approximately  <dig>  or  <dig>  nucleotides upstream of the reported gli <dig> tss, tss-s . additionally, we analyzed gli <dig> exon-skipping events in the hh signaling responsive nih3t <dig> cells, with or without treatment by the smo agonist sag  <cit> , the constitutively activated ptch1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast  cell line, and c57bl/ <dig> mouse embryos at  <dig>  and  <dig>  days post coitum  by nested pcr with primer sets within exon  <dig> and  <dig> . inclusion of all exons  and exon 1b skipping were the two splicing events detected in the analyzed samples . interestingly, the ratio of these two variants was different depending on context. moreover, we could neither detect exon  <dig> and  <dig> skipping, as observed in human  <cit> , nor skipping of both exons 1a and 1b  <cit>  in these samples or in a mouse cdna panel . additionally, the recently reported exon 3-partial exon  <dig> skipping in human  <cit> , was not observed, even though the reverse primers used hybridized to the retained exon  <dig> segment. note that all mouse gli <dig> mrna variants observed are characterized by unique 5' untranslated regions , but a common translational start site in exon  <dig> 

expression profiles of gli <dig> variants in embryos, cell lines, and medulloblastoma tumors
to compare the expression pattern of the 5' gli <dig> variants, we performed real-time rt-pcr with pcr primers designed to specifically detect the individual gli <dig> transcripts . as a control, we also used another primer set, from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig>  to detect the 3' end of the gli <dig> mrnas.

initially, we confirmed gli <dig> variant expression in the c57bl/ <dig> mouse embryos at  <dig>  and  <dig>  d.p.c. by real-time rt-pcr . similarly to the nested pcr analysis shown in figure 1b, gli <dig> variants skipping exon 1b  were more abundant to the ones including exon 1b  in both embryonic stages. furthermore, the cycle threshold  values of gli <dig> variants that were transcribed from tss-l and tss-m  were nearly equal to the ct values of either the Δe1b or the exon  <dig> to  <dig>  transcripts. this finding highlighted that the majority of the mouse gli <dig> mrnas initiate at upstream tsss in the embryo, in agreement with the previous observations of the nih3t <dig> cell line . additionally, to elucidate the in vivo distribution of these gli <dig> transcripts in developing embryonic compartments, we analyzed  <dig>  d.p.c. mouse embryos by whole mount in situ hybridization . all probes used showed comparable distribution patterns of the variants, as also did a gli <dig> 3' end control riboprobe. these data suggested that the expression of all the alternative gli <dig> mrnas was likely to be controlled by similar developmental mechanisms.

to test the impact of hh signaling activation on the expression of the gli <dig> variants, real-time rt-pcr analysis was performed in the hh signaling responsive nih3t <dig> cells and wild type mefs , and the constitutively active sufu-/- and ptch1-/- mefs . in nih3t <dig> cells, the e1b variant was more abundant than the Δe1b, and hh signaling activation, elicited by sag, could not alter the predominance of e1b. on the other hand, wtmefs expressed the Δe1b variant as the major gli <dig> transcript and, in line with nhi3t <dig> cells, exhibited a parallel upregulation of the alternative gli <dig> variants by hh signaling activation, resulting in an expression pattern similar to that of sufu-/- mefs. moreover, ptch1-/- mefs equally expressed both the e1b and the Δe1b variants, even though the ct value of the l+m transcripts was similar to that of sag-treated wtmefs or sufu-/- mefs. importantly, the wtmefs and sufu-/- mefs, which were Δe1b variant-dominant, were both established from c57bl/ <dig> mice, nih3t <dig> cells, which were e1b variant-dominant were from balb/c mice, while ptch1-/- mefs, which had comparable expression of both variants, were from mice with mixed genetic background  <cit> .

overactivated hh signaling and gli <dig> overexpression play a central role in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis  <cit> . this prompted us to investigate the expression profile of the gli <dig> variants in medulloblastomas from the tumor-prone sufu+/-trp53-/- mice maintained on a c57bl/ <dig> genetic background  by using real-time rt-pcr . as anticipated, the expression of all gli <dig> variants was remarkably upregulated in the tumor samples compared to normal cerebellum, but the relative expression pattern of the variants was not apparently influenced by tumorigenesis. additionally, the Δe1b variant was found to be expressed at higher levels than e1b, as in wtmefs and sufu-/- mefs. similar upregulation patterns of the gli <dig> transcripts were also observed in medulloblastomas from ptch1+/- mice maintained on a c57bl/ <dig> genetic background .

these results are therefore suggesting that neither hh signaling activation nor tumorigenesis preferentially affect the regulation of expression of the individual gli <dig> variants. on the other hand there is a strong influence of the mouse strain/genotype. c57bl/ <dig> mice predominantly express the Δe1b variant, balb/c mice the e1b variant, while mice with mixed genetic background have comparable expression of both. in line with these observations, a mouse cdna panel from balb/c mice consistently showed increased expression of the e1b relative to the Δe1b variant .

identification of snp and sine polymorphisms involved in mouse gli <dig> exon 1b inclusion/skipping
since our results clearly indicated that the relative expression pattern of the gli <dig> variants was not affected by either hh signaling or tumorigenesis, but instead the Δe1b to e1b ratio was well correlated with the mouse strains analyzed, variations in the genomic dna sequence, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms , could be involved. to identify differences among the mouse strains that influence the expression of these variants, we pcr amplified and sequenced the gli <dig> exon 1b genomic region from nhi3t <dig>  wtmefs and ptch1-/- mefs. three snps in the vicinity of the donor site of the intron 1b were identified, one of which affected the conserved 5' intronic dinucleotides . nih3t <dig> cells, which predominantly express the exon 1b-included variants, have the canonical gt dinucleotide sequence at the intronic boundary. on the other hand, wtmefs, as well as sufu-/- mefs , which predominantly express the exon 1b-skipped variants, have a gc intronic dinucleotide, implying a less efficient exon definition and consequently an increased exon skipping  <cit> . interestingly, ptch1-/- mefs are apparently heterozygous, containing both the gt and the gc alleles, in line with the comparable expression of the exon 1b-included and -skipped variants. moreover, to further assess the effects of these snps on splicing efficiency, the gt and gc alleles were analyzed with two different splice site predictors, human splicing finder  <cit>  and nnsplice  <dig>   <cit> . both programs demonstrated that the snps affect the prediction of splice sites, with the gt allele predicted to contain the expected 5' splice site, while this was not the case for the gc allele.

additionally, c3h/10t1/ <dig> cells, which are generally used for hh signaling-dependent differentiation assays  <cit> , were analyzed. interestingly, no exon 1b inclusion could be detected by either real-time rt-pcr  or nested pcr with primers within exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> . moreover, sequencing the exon 1b genomic region identified two insertions, a sine b <dig> repeat in intron 1a and importantly, a sine b <dig> repeat in exon 1b, which expanded the exonic sequence from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides . consequently, the expanded exon 1b sequence, in combination with the presence of the gc intronic dinucleotide, further reduced exon definition, resulting in complete exon skipping  <cit> . these findings are therefore providing support to the notion of the importance of sequence polymorphisms in defining splicing patterns.

functional analysis of the gli <dig> 5' untranslated regions
since the expression pattern of gli <dig> variants was depended on the genetic background and was maintained as a fingerprint in different mouse strains, the possibility of regulatory roles for the alternative 5' utrs was considered  <cit> . this was further supported by the fact that the 5' utrs of mouse gli <dig> have high gc content and are predicted to form multi- and long stem-loop structures . to address the functional impact of these untranslated regions on the gli <dig> mrna transcripts, six 5' utrs, namely l, m, s, lΔ1b, mΔ1b and sΔ1b , were cloned in front of the renilla luciferase gene of the psicheck <dig> vector. these constructs were transiently transfected into wtmefs or nih3t <dig> cells, with or without signaling activation by sag treatment, and into ptch1-/- or sufu-/- mefs. in all cases, elimination of 5' segments, from l to m and then to s resulted in higher luciferase activity . additionally, skipping of exon 1b had a significant positive effect on the luciferase activity in the case of the l and s constructs, but was less pronounced for the m construct. this implies that not only 5' utr length but also alterations in secondary structure, elicited by exon 1b skipping, may influence heterologous protein production. moreover, hh signaling activation had no apparent influence on the observed luciferase activities. collectively, these data suggest that the choice of transcription start site, in combination with exon 1b inclusion/skipping, influences the capacity of the gli <dig> variants to produce a protein product.

finally, we investigated whether this differential capacity of the 5' utrs is due to modulations of the mrna stability or the translational efficiency. to achieve this, the endogenous gli <dig> levels in wtmefs were enriched by sag, followed by inhibition of the process of transcription with actinomycin d treatment and subsequent mrna measurements. the results revealed no significant differences in mrna stability among the gli <dig> variants . thus, it may be suggested that the alternative 5' utrs are likely to regulate gli <dig> protein levels via translational mechanisms.

discussion
in this report the 5' utr regions of the mouse gli <dig> gene were analyzed, resulting in the identification of two novel transcription start sites and sequence polymorphisms, which control exon 1b inclusion/skipping. our findings demonstrate that snps in the 5' splice site of intron 1b and a sine b <dig> insertion in exon 1b have major effects in determining the expression ratio of the 5' utr variant mrnas, which distinctly influence translational efficiency .

initially, 5' race and rt-pcr analysis clearly showed 5' variations in the gli <dig> transcripts . however, the previously reported exon  <dig> - exon  <dig> skipping in human normal tissues/tumor cell lines  <cit> , exon  <dig> - partial exon  <dig> skipping in human cancer cells and especially glioblastomas  <cit>  and exon 1a - exon 1b skipping in mouse  <cit>  could not be detected. moreover, the 5' race analysis revealed the presence of some minor transcripts, apparently transcribed from alternative tsss . as their expression levels were quite low, we chose to focus on the relatively abundant gli <dig> variants in order to analyze the impact of alternative transcripts on hh signaling.

we demonstrated that exon 1b inclusion/skipping is intimately related with snps in the donor site of intron 1b . the gt allele contains a canonical 5' splice site sequence, allowing efficient exon 1b definition and consequently enhances the inclusion of exon 1b, as observed in nih3t <dig> cells. on the other hand, the gc allele has a weaker 5' splice site sequence, resulting in a less efficient exon 1b definition and therefore promotes the skipping of exon 1b, as observed in wtmefs and sufu-/- mefs. moreover, ptch1-/- mefs, which are heterozygous and contain both the gt and gc alleles, expressed comparable levels of the exon 1b-included and -skipped variants.

since the relative expression pattern of the gli <dig> variants was not affected by either hh signaling activity  or tumorigenesis /embryogenesis , the identified polymorphisms are primary determinants in controlling the splicing regulation of the gli <dig> 5' utrs. snps/mutations affecting splicing have been reported for consensus splice sites, but were also identified at significant distances from splice junctions  <cit> . our own analysis of the  <dig> reported mutations of ptch <dig> revealed the presence of  <dig> intronic splice changes  <cit> . these findings highlight the importance of snps/mutations in altering splicing patterns, as these may occur not only at canonical splice sites but also at exonic/intronic splicing enhancers/silencers.

additionally, evolutionary comparisons indicated that gc is likely to represent the ancestral intronic dinucleotide at the 5' splice site of intron 1b, since it is conserved in rat and other species, with the gt substitution and the sine b <dig> insertion occurring at later stages . interestingly, in the primate lineage the exon 1b region is characterized by an alu insertion. these facts suggest that this genomic segment might be genetically unstable and a hotspot for transposon insertion.

5' utrs are known to regulate protein expression via modulation of mrna stability and/or translational efficiency  <cit> . we analyzed the alternative gli <dig> 5' utrs in various cell lines and found that 5' end shortening as well as skipping of exon 1b increased their capacity for heterologous protein expression . these observations are in line with previous claims purporting that shorter 5' utrs of gli <dig> are more capable of efficient translation  <cit> , and support the notion that alternative events in 5' utrs of mammalian genes are likely to contribute to the regulation of translation  <cit> . moreover, mrna stability assays of the alternative gli <dig> transcripts revealed that variations in the 5' utrs did not affect the pattern of rna degradation, and consequently, these untranslated sequences regulate gli <dig> protein levels by modulating translational efficiency. interestingly and in line with these observations, hedgehog signaling-dependent mouse models for medulloblastoma development are apparently influenced by the gli <dig> genotype. deletion of one ptch <dig> allele in c57bl/ <dig> mice, which are homozygous for the gc allele, results in a higher incidence of medulloblastomas compared to mice with a mixed genetic background  <cit> .

secondary structure prediction of the gli <dig> 5' utrs by mfold highlighted the presence of a long stem-loop structure in l and m that is retained in mΔ1b but not in lΔ1b and may have a role in the differential translatabilities of mΔ1b versus lΔ1b . however, free energy, Δg, calculations were not fully in line with the capacity for translation. in addition, we examined whether two other parameters, g-quadruplex  dna/rna structures and upstream orf , might influence the translational efficiency . nucleotide region 251- <dig> has a g <dig> motif sequence g3-n1-7-g3-n1-7-g3-n1-7-g <dig>  and nucleotide region 22- <dig> has a similar sequence with a potential g <dig> structure. moreover, the genome wide g <dig> dna database quadbase  <cit>  predicted an antisense g <dig> motif at nucleotide region 322- <dig>  g4-structures are formed not only on dna but also on rna  <cit> , and a g <dig> motif on the nras mrna was reported to suppress translation  <cit> . additionally, the exon 1b-included variants, l, m and s, have an uporf in the same frame as the gli <dig> orf , while the exon 1b-skipped variants, lΔ1b, mΔ1b and sΔ1b, have an uporf  that overlaps with the gli <dig> orf. although no significant differences between fully upstream and overlapping uporf could be identified in a recent report, long cap-to-uporf distances were found to increase translational inhibition  <cit> . wang and rothnagel have used a 5' utr construct , which is almost equivalent to the s construct in this report, mutated at four atg codons and apparently eliminating  <dig> amino acids uporf that we have identified, and observed increased reporter activity, in line with the above predictions  <cit> . thus, the combinations of uporfs with g <dig> structures in the gli <dig> 5' utrs are likely to have a role as mediators of the observed patterns of translation.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings highlight the complex posttranscriptional regulation of the mouse gli <dig> oncogene. mrna variants with alternative 5' utrs were identified, mechanisms that control their expression levels were dissected, and the differential impact of the 5' utrs on protein synthesis was determined. moreover, the demonstrated strain differences in regulatory controls of this oncogene suggest that these may have a role in modulating tumor susceptibility in mouse models.
