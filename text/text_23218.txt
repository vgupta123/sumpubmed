BACKGROUND
sex determination is a fundamental developmental process, affecting the sexual differentiation of gonads, and leads to sex-specific differences in behavior, physiology and morphology. sex-determining systems can be divided into two categories: genotypic sex determination  and environmental sex determination   <cit> . gsd is attributed to the genetic segregation of genes, often residing on sex chromosomes that initiate alternate sex-determining developmental pathways. in contrast, esd has repeatedly arisen during animal evolution  <cit>  and is initiated by diverse environmental cues, such as temperature, photoperiod, nutrition and population density, that trigger alternative genetic signals, resulting in the regulation of male or female sex-determining genes  <cit> .

natural selection of rare mutational variants has been suggested to mediate the transitions between gsd and esd  <cit> . a previous phylogenetic analysis revealed that there have been at least three independent switches from gsd to esd in lizards, and six transitions from esd to gsd in turtles  <cit> . moreover, previous experiments using temperature-sensitive mutations created artificially in caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated how gsd could rapidly evolve into esd as a consequence of a mutation in key sex determining genes  <cit> . orthologs of gsd genes such as dmrt <dig>  sox <dig> and cyp19a  are expressed in the gonads during the temperature-sensitive period in esd of reptiles  <cit> . thus, according to the current interpretation of these data, esd mechanisms are likely to share many sex-determining components with gsd  <cit> .

sex determination systems in insects vary considerably in key factors and regulatory mechanisms to develop sex-specific traits. the sex determination mechanism in drosophila melanogaster is best understood. the ratio of x chromosomes to autosomes  is thought to provide the initial signal for the activation of sex-lethal , a master gene of the sex determination cascade. then, sxl is produced as the sex-specific splicing isoforms. sxl in female acts on the pre-mrna of transformer  resulting in reproduction of functional tra. the functional tra in the female, in concert with tra- <dig>  regulates the production of female-specific doublesex  mrna. the male-specific splice form of dsx mrna is the default splice-variant in d. melanogaster. dsx regulates the various sex-specific traits such as gonads. recently, sex determination mechanisms have also been demonstrated in various insect lineages such as diptera , hymenoptera  and coleoptera . these studies revealed that tra and dsx are highly conserved among insects  <cit> . however, in case of lepidoptera, bombyx mori, tra and tra- <dig> are assumed not to be required for the sex-specific splicing of bmdsx pre-mrna, because bmdsx has no tra/tra- <dig> binding motif. recently, it has been revealed that binding of the bmpsi, a bombyx homolog of p-element somatic inhibitor, to the exonic splicing suppressor sequence on expected region is involved in sex-specific splicing of bmdsx <cit> . these data suggest that upstream genetic cascades of dsx might be diverse among insects.

the cladocera  is an ancient clade of branchiopod crustaceans comprising  <dig> or  <dig> family lineages  <cit>  that all reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis involving esd  <cit> . the most well studied species are from the family daphniidae, particularly of the genus daphnia. daphnia inhabit freshwater ponds and lakes on all continents and are known to switch between parthenogenetic and sexual reproduction when environmental conditions for growth and reproduction deteriorate. during normal growing conditions, populations are most often entirely composed of females. however, shortened photoperiod, a lack of food and/or increased population density all lead to the clonal production of males that are genetically identical to their sisters and mothers  <cit> . first instar male juveniles are easily distinguished from the females  <cit> . during maturation, daphniids undergo morphological sexual differentiation of various somatic tissues, including the armament of a first thoracic leg with the copulatory hook in males, which becomes larger during the fifth instar  <cit> . gonads develop and finally settle at both sides of the gut during embryogenesis in both sexes  <cit> . the appearance of males allows sexual reproduction to occur  <cit> , when females begin producing haploid eggs requiring fertilization.

recently, we and others found that male production occurred independently of environmental cues by treatment with exogenous juvenile hormone  or its analogs  <cit> . exposure of d. magna to jh analogs at the stage corresponding to the environmentally-sensitive period for sex determination of a cladoceran species of the family moinidae  <cit> , produced exclusively male broods, suggesting that jh could be a key molecule for understanding mechanisms of esd  <cit> .

a doublesex  gene was originally identified in d. melanogaster as a critical and terminal transcription factor in the fly sex determining cascade. dsx is spatially and temporally transcribed into two sex-specific splice forms conferring sexually dimorphic traits during development  <cit> . the dsx gene contains two conserved domains: the dsx/mab- <dig>  domain at the n-terminus and the oligomerization domain at the c-terminus  <cit> . genes encoding dm-domain  were discovered to play a related role in c. elegans <cit>  and also in vertebrates  <cit> . in contrast, results from numerous studies have shown that other genes in the genetic sex-determination cascade widely diversified among species  <cit> .

to understand the molecular and evolutionary relationships between gsd and esd, we previously identified and analyzed three dm-domain genes  from d. magna, displaying sexual dimorphic gene expression patterns in adult gonads  <cit> . however, none of these dm-domain genes exhibited sexually dimorphic expression patterns during embryonic development, suggesting that they are not involved in sex determination  <cit> . two additional dm-domain genes were later found in the d. magna expressed sequence tags  database  <cit> . therefore, we analyzed the function of these two genes from d. magna using gene manipulations that we developed  <cit> . these experiments revealed that two dsx genes in d. magna were obtained by lineage-specific duplication, and then one of the paralogs, daphnia magna dsx <dig> , plays an important role in directing the major sexually dimorphic development of d. magna <cit> . in contrast, specific function of daphnia magna dsx <dig>  remains unknown. these newly identified dsx genes showed greater sequence similarity at the amino acid sequence level to known insect dsx genes than to the previously identified dm-domain containing genes in d. magna. a genome-wide study of gene functions in d. pulex suggested that lineage-specific duplicated genes are most responsive to varying environmental conditions  <cit> . in the present study, we investigated the sequence and functional conservation of the two dsx genes in a broader taxonomic sampling of cladocerans by cloning dsx homologs, and determining their sex specific expression in four species representing two families and three genera. we also analyzed the structures of cloned dsx genes of d. magna and d. pulex including their putative regulatory motifs and putative transcription factor binding sites in the 5â€™ upstream regions of these duplicated dsx genes.

RESULTS
molecular cloning of doublesex genes from cladocerans
to verify whether homologs of dsx genes among daphniids are conserved, we first cloned dsx genes from four cladocerans , then characterized them by comparison with dsx genes of d. magna and several insect species  <cit>  . as a result, two dsx homologs were identified from d. pulex, d. galeata and c. dubia, while only one dsx homolog was isolated from m. macrocopa . the deduced amino acid sequences of all  <dig> homologs contained the expected dm- and oligomerization-domains, which are characteristic for all arthropod dsx family members  <cit>  . phylogenetic analysis with other known dsx of various species revealed that dsx of cladocerans grouped into two distinct monophyletic groups: dsx <dig> and dsx <dig> . because dsx of the giant tiger prawn penaeus monodon is rooted ancestrally to both dsx <dig> and dsx <dig>  the gene duplication event likely occurred after the divergence of branchiopoda and malacostraca . in the present study, only dsx <dig>  but not dsx <dig>  was identified from m. macrocopa. to test whether another copy might exist, we performed reverse transcription pcr assays using primers corresponding to highly conserved region of dsx <dig> and dsx <dig> among daphniidae. only a single amplified dna could be detected from both sexes in m. macrocopa . these results suggest that the dsx gene duplication occurred prior to the divergence of these cladoceran species, therefore we infer that the m. macrocopa dsx <dig> gene was secondarily lost.

by comparing the dapmadsx <dig> sequence to orthologs from the four studied species , we found that dapmadsx <dig> shows 88-58%, 100-95%, 88-48%, 100-78% and 96-61% sequence identities to the a, b , c, d  and e domains, respectively . similarly, by comparing the dapmadsx <dig> sequence with identified orthologs, we observed that dapmadsx <dig> shows comparable relative ratios among each of the domains: 74-66%, 98-97%, 88-67%, 100-78% and 92-69% sequence identities to the a, b, c, d and e domains, respectively . these results suggest that putative amino acids of both the dm- and oligomerization-domains are highly conserved among the cladocera. on the other hand, amino acid similarities outside of these domains are lower, and are proportional to the evolutionary distance between each genus; daphnia, ceriodaphnia and moina <cit>  .

the dm-domain contains zinc chelating residues, and among the insects studied to date, two highly conserved amino acid residues, threonine and glutamine , distinguish the dm-domain of dsx from dm-domains of other insect proteins  <cit> . therefore, we searched for similar highly conserved amino acid residues within the dsx dm-domains of cladocerans. indeed, all zinc chelating residues are found to be conserved in the dm domains of dsx <dig> and dsx <dig> among the five cladoceran species . yet, although the threonine and glutamine residues were conserved in dsx <dig>  the glutamine residue in dsx <dig> was substituted by arginine in all cladoceran species examined . these results suggest that dsx <dig> in cladocerans might have gained a novel function affecting sex determination by amino acid replacement after duplication of dsx in branchiopoda lineage.

compared to the dm-domains, more amino acid variation is observed in alignments of the oligomerization-domains . dimerization, which enhances specific dna binding, is mediated by several residues in a non-polar interface that is conserved within oligomerization-domains. previous study has revealed that, in dsx <dig> of d. magna, two of three nonpolar amino acids indispensable for formation of the nonpolar interface are substituted with the polar acidic amino acid, aspartic acid  <cit> . this suggests that the daphniid dsx <dig> proteins are unable to dimerize and may not be functional or may have a different, unknown functions.

sex specific expression of dsx genes in five cladoceran species
we previously reported that both dsx genes in d. magna were transcriptionally up-regulated in males and showed no sex-specific splice isoforms. we and others also reported that exposure to jh analogs reliably produces male daphniids  <cit> . moreover, by using gene knock-down  and overexpression methods in d. magna <cit> , we discovered that dapmadsx <dig> is necessary and sufficient for sex determination in d. magna, whereas the tandemly duplicated dapmadsx <dig> gene does not determine sex, even though its transcription is equally sex-biased  <cit> .

in this study, we confirmed that expression patterns of dapmadsx <dig> and dapmadsx <dig> homologous genes are conserved in other cladocerans, by studying steady state mrna levels for dsx transcripts in adult females and males by quantitative pcr. we found that the mrna levels of these dsx genes range from seven to forty fold greater in males than in females . our results indicate that the sexual dimorphic mrna expression patterns of dsx are conserved among daphniids and moina.

annotation of dsx gene structures in d. magna and d. pulex
we previously cloned and described the mrna transcripts of the dapmadsx <dig> and dapmadsx <dig> genes  <cit> . dapmadsx <dig> produces two mrna, dapmadsx1-Î± and dapmadsx1-Î², which are expressed in both sexes and differ only in their 5â€™ utr, while dapmadsx <dig> produces only one mrna transcript. the d. pulex draft genome sequence was recently published  <cit> , and the d. magna genome sequencing project is currently in progress by the daphnia genomics consortium. the dapmadsx1-Î±, dapmadsx1-Î², and dapmadsx <dig> mrna transcripts were aligned to the genome assemblies and used to annotate the dsx <dig> and dsx <dig> gene models in the d. magna and d. pulex genomes .

the d. magna dsx gene cluster is located on scaffold  <dig> of the d. magna genome assembly v <dig>  with a ~ <dig> kbp intergenic region between the dapmadsx <dig>  and dapmadsx <dig>  genes . the second exon of the dapmadsx1-Î² mrna transcript fell within an assembly gap in scaffold  <dig>  but was located on scaffold  <dig>  we conclude that scaffold  <dig>  characterizes a ~ <dig>  kbp gap in scaffold  <dig>  located in the intragenic region of dapmadsx <dig> 

the d. pulex dsx gene cluster is located on scaffold  <dig> of the d. pulex genome assembly v <dig>  with a ~ <dig>  kbp intergenic region between the dappudsx <dig>  and dappudsx <dig>  genes . the d. pulex v <dig>  gene model predictions did not correctly identify the dsx <dig> and dsx <dig> duplicate gene cluster. our annotations improved the dsx gene models in both d. magna and d. pulex genomes.

potential transcriptional regulatory elements in the 5â€™ upstream promoter regions of the dsx genes
to further annotate putative functional and conserved elements of the dsx genes, we searched and compared transcriptional promoter regions of the genes in d. magna and d. pulex.  <dig>  kbp upstream of the transcription start site  of dsx1-Î±, dsx1-Î², and dsx <dig> were extracted as transcriptional regulatory regions. this interval spans the predicted intergenic region between adjacent loci. promoter sequences are challenging for multiple alignment algorithms, because upstream regulatory regions are not well conserved compared to protein coding regions of genes  <cit> . we aligned orthologous promoter sequences from d. magna and d. pulex using pro-coffee  <cit> , an alignment algorithm specifically designed for homologous promoter regions . the dapmadsx1-Î± and dappudsx1-Î± promoter alignment showed 46% sequence identity , the dapmadsx1-Î² and dappudsx1-Î² promoter alignment showed 60% sequence identity , and the dapmadsx <dig> and dappudsx <dig> promoter alignment showed 62% sequence identity . the promoter regions of dsx <dig> and dsx <dig> have much less conservation than their respective protein coding regions, which have 84% and 83% sequence identity, respectively .

we characterized putative known transcription factor binding sites  in the dsx upstream promoter regions using transcription factor map  alignments  <cit>  between orthologous dsx promoter regions in d. magna and d. pulex, based on matches to position frequency matrices  from jaspar  <cit>  and transfac  <cit>  tfbs databases. the optimal dsx1-Î± promoter tf-map alignment contains  <dig> putative known tfbss . the optimal dsx1-Î² promoter tf-map alignment contains  <dig> putative known tfbss . the optimal dsx <dig> promoter tf-map alignment contains  <dig> putative known tfbss . the positions of the putative tfbs pairs  are well aligned when annotated onto the promoter sequence pro-coffee alignments , suggesting these predicted putative tfbss are conserved between d. magna and d. pulex.

we compared the number of unique predicted transcription factors  shared amongst the dsx promoter regions . in total,  <dig> unique tfs were predicted in the dsx promoters, half  are present in at least two of the promoters . six unique tfs were predicted in all three dsx promoters; an additional six unique tfs were also shared between dsx1-Î² and dsx <dig> promoter regions. interestingly,  <dig> unique tfs were predicted in the dsx <dig> promoter but not in either dsx <dig> promoters. we previously showed that dsx1-Î² mrna expression levels are three times greater than expression levels of dsx1-Î± during male d. magna development, and that transcription of dsx <dig> is even greater than both dsx <dig> mrnas combined  <cit> . the shared tf motifs suggest a duplication history involving at least part of the 5â€™ region upstream of dsx1-Î², while numeric differences observed among dsx promoter regions are reflective of these expression level differences. based on the promoter sequence conservation between d. magna and d. pulex, and the greater number of predicted tfs, the dsx1-Î² promoter seems to be the more widely used and evolutionarily conserved, while the dsx1-Î± promoter has experienced more sequence divergence and loss of tfbss.

since we previously reported that dapmadsx <dig> and dapmadsx <dig> are paralogs, and that both dapmadsx <dig> and dapmadsx <dig> mrnas are transcriptionally up-regulated in male d. magna <cit> , we searched for de novo conserved motifs present in all dsx promoter regions in d. magna and d. pulex , without reference to tfbs sequence databases. we identified  <dig> conserved motifs in the daphnia dsx promoters , which can later be functionally investigated as potential tfbss and/or potential transcriptional promoters of daphnia dsx. the motifs were labeled m <dig> through m <dig> and annotated onto the d. magna/d. pulex dsx promoter alignments . motifs  <dig> through  <dig> were also found in the d. melanogaster dsx upstream promoter region, supporting the conservation and potential regulatory functions of these motifs.

in order to assess whether these de novo conserved motifs are similar to any known tfbss, we scanned the individual motif sequences for matches to tfbs pfms and compared each motif consensus sequence to known tfbs consensus sequences. several of the conserved motifs showed similarity to known tfbss . motif  <dig> matches the tfbs of mirr, a homeobox transcription factor in the iroquois complex of transcription factors, which is predicted in all three dsx promoter tf-map alignments . motif  <dig> matches the tfbs of vvl, a homeobox transcription factor which is predicted in both dsx1-Î² and dsx <dig> tf-map alignments . motif  <dig> matches the tfbs of gsc/bcd/oc, three homeobox transcription factors with nearly identical binding sites , with four of the motif  <dig> sequences matching the gsc/bcd/oc consensus taatc exactly. gsc was also predicted in the dsx <dig> tf-map alignment, and oc was predicted in the dsx1-Î± tf-map alignment. motif  <dig> matches the tfbs of pan, a high mobility group transcription factor, which is predicted in both dsx1-Î² and dsx <dig> tf-map alignments . motif  <dig> also matches the tfbs of pan, but with the reverse complement of the binding site . the similarity of these de novo conserved motifs to known tfbss that were also predicted by the tf-map alignment further supports our results describing the regulatory elements of the daphnia dsx genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identified the orthologs of dapmadsx <dig> and dapmadsx <dig> genes from closely related species belonging to two cladoceran families and three genera: d. pulex, d. galeata, c. dubia  and m. macrocopa , with highly conserved dm- and oligomerization-domains. all five species examined exhibited sexually dimorphic expression pattern of dsx genes, suggesting that these genes may have similar functions for sex determination in cladocerans. daphniids are unique animals that exhibit esd and are; therefore, attractive for understanding the evolution of esd. we also identified potential regulatory motifs and transcription factor binding sites in the putative promoter regions of these genes in d. magna and d. pulex. this information will facilitate future study of molecular mechanisms underlying sex-determination in cladocerans.
