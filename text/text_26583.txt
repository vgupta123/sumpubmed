BACKGROUND
an impaired collagen metabolism is hypothesized to disturb the wound healing process with the consequence of hernia formation and hernia recurrence. in vivo studies of hernia patients revealed irregularly arranged collagen fibers, disturbed collagen hydroxylation and an altered collagen framework resulting in increased tissue elasticity  <cit> . analysis of the extracellular matrix in patients with either primary or recurrent incisional hernias revealed alterations in type i and type iii collagen gene expression: a decreased ratio with increased type iii collagen protein was detected in incisional hernia patients and was confirmed at the transcript level  <cit> . alterations of the collagen composition may occur due to changes in collagen synthesis as well as turn-over. for the latter, matrix-degrading proteases may represent key factors. bellon et al. have suggested that high expression levels of metalloproteinase  <dig>  play a pathogenetic role for direct inguinal hernia formation  <cit> .

age above  <dig> years and male gender are dominant demographic factors that correlate with the incidence of incisional hernia disease and collagen metabolism  <cit> . collagen content is significantly decreased in women who have pelvic organ prolapse regardless of age, parity, body mass index, or tobacco use  <cit> . furthermore estrogen is a major regulator of wound healing that can reverse age- and sex-related impaired wound healing in human and animal models, characterized by a dampened inflammatory response and increased matrix deposition  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated estrogen-mediated effects on collagen and mmp- <dig> metabolism  <cit> . topical estrogen treatment in both males and females decreased wound size with increased collagen levels and enhanced tensile strength  <cit> . jorgensen et al. reported increased collagen deposition in premenopausal women after subcutaneous implantation of expanded poly-tetra-fluorethylene test tubes compared to postmenopausal women  <cit> . furthermore estrogens influence mmp- <dig> expression, as mmp- <dig> levels are reduced after treatment with estrogen in ovariectomized rats  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to evaluate the immediate effect of β-estradiol on type i and iii collagen as well as mmp- <dig> gene expression in the principal cell type responsible for wound healing that is the fibroblast. an in vitro model system was established with primary fibroblast cultures from patients with and without recurrent incisional hernia disease.

RESULTS
collagen type ia <dig> and iiia <dig> expression levels in fibroblasts from patients with recurrent incisional hernia disease compared to control fibroblasts

the type ia1/iiia <dig> collagen ratio was significantly decreased in fibroblasts from male and female patients with incisional hernia disease  compared to control fibroblasts from patients without recurrent hernia disease .

changes of collagen expression by β-estradiol stimulation
stimulation with  <dig>  ng/ml and  <dig>  ng/ml β-estradiol for  <dig> hours led to increased type ia <dig> and type iiia <dig> collagen mrna expression levels in fibroblasts from the female control patient . this effect lasted for more than  <dig> hours, however no differences could be detected for the different concentrations of β-estradiol . stimulation with β-estradiol had no effect on type ia <dig> and type iiia <dig> collagen expression in male control fibroblasts  and female incisional hernia fibroblasts  . exclusively, male hernia fibroblasts showed high levels of type iiia <dig> collagen after stimulation with  <dig>  ng/ml β-estradiol for  <dig> h . the type ia1/iii collagen mrna ratio was significantly lower in fibroblasts derived from patients with incisional hernia disease, both female and male , and this ratio was not affected by stimulation with  <dig>  and  <dig>  ng/ml β-estradiol . similarly β-estradiol had no influence on the type ia1/iii collagen mrna ratio in control fibroblasts .

alterations of mmp- <dig> expression and enzyme activities in primary fibroblast cultures from patients with recurrent incisional hernia disease compared to control fibroblasts

the mmp- <dig> mrna expression was significantly lower in female and male ihfs compared to cfs . stimulation with  <dig>  ng/ml β-estradiol enhanced mmp- <dig> expression in female as well as male cfs , but not in ihfs .

estrogen receptor expression
in all primary fibroblast cultures gene expression of estrogen receptor  <dig>  and, to a minor extend, estrogen receptor  <dig>  could be detected.

discussion
in the present study the influence of estrogen on the expression of collagen type ia <dig> and iiia <dig> as well as matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> gene was determined in four different cell cultures. these fibroblasts were obtained from heterogeneous donors that were distinct regarding their history of recurrent hernia disease, sex, bmi and age. the number of cell cultures has to be regarded as a limitation of the study. but besides their heterogeneity, incisional hernia fibroblasts exhibit a reduction of type i to iii collagen ratio on the transcriptional level in vivo. these results confirm former studies of our group that described a significantly reduced type i/iii collagen ratio on the protein as well as on the transcriptional level in patients with recurrent incisional hernia disease in vivo  <cit> . it is remarkable that these changes were detected in the absence of any inflammatory cells, pre-existing extracellular matrix and the lack of a three-dimensional cellular network. from this observation it may be concluded that incisional hernia fibroblasts retain an altered phenotype under in vitro conditions and are accessible to ample the influence of steroidal modulation on these cells.

the basic massage of our study is that the individual can be identified as an independent factor for the β-estradiol induced alterations of collagen gene expression. regarding literature female sex hormones have ample effects on cell growth and the development of connective tissue but in vitro findings are sometimes controversial. topical estrogen treatment is reported to increase collagen levels, decrease wound size and to enhance tensile strength in both males and female  <cit> . in accord with this β-estradiol application enhanced collagen gene expression in healthy, female fibroblasts in our study but not in healthy male donors . a sex dependent effect of estrogen was described by lee et al. who suggested that estrogen effects on collagens is unique to females and might be responsible for the increased incidence of ligaments injury in female athletes  <cit> .

several other studies suggest that estrogens repress collagen expression: in the rat hip capsule, skin, aorta, and tail tendon long-term estrogen administration causes a decrease in the total amount of collagen  <cit> . hassager et al. demonstrated that oral estrogen therapy significantly reduces type i procollagen in postmenopausal women and increases total body type iii collagen content in a similar group of patients  <cit> . yu and co-workers established fibroblast cultures from the anterior cruciate ligament and reported a decreased type i procollagen synthesis with increasing estradiol levels whereas no differences in type iii collagen synthesis were detected  <cit> . in accordance we found that β-estradiol at a concentration of  <dig>  ng/ml and  <dig>  ng/ml had no effect on type ia1/iii collagen mrna ratio in control fibroblasts nor in incisional hernia fibroblasts . in conclusion these date indicate that estrogen is inappropriate to reverse the impaired type i/iii collagen ratio in hernia fibroblasts. regarding these reports, a further decrease of type i/iii collagen ratio in dependence of estrogen incubation is absent for hernia fibroblasts and estrogen seems to be of minor importance for the occurrence of the hernia fibroblast phenotype.

the collagens are under control of a degradation system, the main constituents of which are matrix metalloproteinases   <cit> . mmps are essential for the proper progression of wound healing  <cit> . of note, there is a direct link between mmp- <dig> and collagen gene expression as collagen binding to discoidin domain receptor ii  regulates mmp- <dig> gene transcription  <cit> . a former study of our group investigated the biomaterial induced mmp- <dig> mrna expression in incisional hernia fibroblasts and detected no alterations of their mmp- <dig> synthesis compared to control fibroblasts  <cit> . in contrast, bellon et al. have suggested that high expression levels of metalloproteinase  <dig>  in fibroblasts play a pathogenetic role for hernia formation  <cit> . here, we found that incisional hernia fibroblasts exhibit a decreased mmp- <dig> gene expression. one should take into consideration that the epidemiological data of fibroblast donors vary concerning age, bmi and history of smoking or co- medication and this heterogeneity might explain these differences. as hernia disease predominantly occurs in elderly patients it seems difficult to rule out that 'controls' are affected patients in future. therefore controls should be defined as patients that are older than  <dig> years and underwent an abdominal incision about a decade ago. nevertheless, collagen ration proves true as an important diagnostic tool for incisional hernia disease.

pirila et al. reported, that mmp levels are reduced and type i collagen content is increased in ovariectomized rats after treatment with estrogen  <cit> . the authors conclude that estrogens promote wound healing due to the inhibition of mmp-mediated collagenolysis. in contrary, zecchin et al. described that ovariectomy reduces the expression of mmp- <dig> and type i and iii collagen in female rat molar extraction wounds  <cit> . we found that β-estradiol  increased mmp- <dig> in female fibroblasts from healthy donors. upregulation of mmp- <dig> expression after estrogen treatment has been described in breast cancer cell and vaginal tissue samples  <cit> . in addition, a decreased mmp- <dig> gelatinolytic activity has already been described during skin wound healing of ovx rats. the upregulation of mmp- <dig> and type ia <dig> and iiia <dig> collagen in female fibroblasts confirms the association between estrogen and collagens, and estrogens and mmp- <dig>  estrogen receptor  <dig>  and estrogen receptor  <dig> , which are present in all our primary fibroblast cultures, might be signal transducers  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
though our in vitro study presents preliminary results, the coherence of mmp- <dig> inhibition and diminished type ia <dig> to iii collagen ratio in incisional hernia fibroblasts approves that the expression and processing of key molecules in wound healing is disturbed in hernia patients. β-estradiol metabolism seems of minor importance for the impaired collagen metabolism in these patients. in contrast to alterations of collagen metabolism in the range of incisional hernia disease, the individual was identified as an independent factor for the β-estradiol induced alterations of collagen gene expression. the observation of gender specific β-estradiol-dependent changes of collagen gene expression has to be proven in view of the additive effects of age, bmi, smoking or medication for future studies of cellular response.
