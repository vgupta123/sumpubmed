BACKGROUND
abcc11/mrp <dig>  is a human abc  transporter that secretes several endogenous substrates
 <cit>  including camp, cgmp, as well as exogenous-derived molecules
 <cit>  such as 5fdump , the active metabolite of 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate and aracytine. abcc <dig> is expressed in various tissues such as physiological barriers, suggesting a role in body detoxification
 <cit> . its expression was associated with a decrease of the clinical response to breast tumor chemotherapy
 <cit>  and with a low probability of survival in acute myeloid leukemia
 <cit> . furthermore, abcc <dig> is overexpressed in estrogen receptor-positive cell lines resistant to tamoxifen
 <cit>  and in erbb2-overexpressing breast tumors
 <cit> . by decreasing retention of anticancer agent in cells, abcc <dig> contributes to a multidrug resistance  phenotype leading to cell resistance to a broad range of anticancer agents.

transport of cgmp by abcc <dig> was largely described by guo et al. in  <dig>  they compared the cgmp intracellular contents of abcc <dig> overexpressing cells to their counterpart . only, the abcc <dig> positive cells could extrude cgmp under stimulation by sin-1a. additionally, they described 5fdump transport by abcc <dig> in inside-out membrane vesicles. vesicles bearing high levels of abcc <dig> showed an increased accumulation of 5fdump and allow to conclude that 5fdump is an abcc <dig> substrate. nevertheless, no pharmacokinetic study was undertaken to determine kinetic parameters  neither for cgmp, nor for 5fdump. for the abcc <dig> homolog the km of cgmp was  <dig> ± 20 μm
 <cit> .

abcc <dig> is predicted to contain two membrane-spanning domains  and two nucleotide-binding domains  in a common msd1-nbd1-msd2-nbd <dig> topology with intracellular n- and c-termini. each msd is constituted by six transmembrane segments . since this protein has not yet been crystallized, and confident algorithm tools have been developed to generate homology models based on reference templates
 <cit> , we generated two in silico models. docking analyses led us to identify several amino acid residues potentially implicated in abcc <dig> transport activity. additionally, molecular dynamics simulation revealed for the first time conformational changes that would occur during the transport process.

RESULTS
abcc <dig> inward- and outward-facing models
the first model was based on the mouse mdr <dig> x-ray structure
 <cit>  . mouse mdr <dig> which shares 87% homology with the human protein  was crystallized in a nucleotide-free inward-facing conformation. our abcc <dig> model adopts, as expected, an inward-facing conformation where the assumed drug-binding pocket is exposed to the intracellular space, allowing drug binding before nbds dimerization in the presence of atp . this conformation showed distant nbds and transmembrane helices bundled next to the extracellular side of the membrane.

the second 3d model was based on the sav <dig> crystal structure from staphylococcus aureus obtained in the presence of adp, and adopted an outward-facing conformation
 <cit> . compared to the first model, the conformation is logically reversed ; the substrate cavity is exposed to the extracellular space allowing release of bound substrates. in this conformation, atp hydrolysis and adp release are expected to bring the transporter back to an inward-facing conformation. this outward-facing conformation presents the tm helices bundled next to the nbds, closing the access from the cytoplasmic side of transmembrane domains. the nbds are associated inside a dimer in which nucleotides are sandwiched .

in both abcc <dig> models, msd helices extend from membrane to cytoplasm, forming two intracellular loops  in each msd. the first one is in contact with the cis-nbd while the second one makes contacts with the trans-nbd through its “hinge” sequence. by contrast to mouse abcb <dig> that showed similar hinge sequences , abcc <dig> does not display any conserved hinge sequences with klik in msd <dig> and ssih in msd <dig>  such a contact is supposed to transduce conformational changes occurring from nbd to msd.

the icls show an interesting positively-charged region at the membrane leaflet  containing several lysine and arginine residues. these positive charges, just under the intracellular membrane side, were likely involved in the drug transport process. this may also influence the accurate protein inclusion into the membrane and enhance its stability as described for abcc1
 <cit> . indeed, arg <dig>  lys <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig> of abcc <dig> respectively corresponded to lys <dig>  lys <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig> of abcc1
 <cit>  that were described to be functionally important in organic anion transport. these residues might be involved in abcc11-mediated substrate transport. the abcc <dig> substrate-translocation site was essentially positively charged, consistent with its ability to transport anions. a similar observation was made for its abcc <dig> homolog
 <cit> .

cgmp and 5fdump binding sites in abcc <dig> models
docking analysis on our abcc <dig> models revealed two putative binding pockets for cgmp and 5fdump . an internal binding site  in abcc <dig> was located next to the intracellular side of the transmembrane region. it involved tm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in this pocket, cgmp interacted with ser <dig> in the inward-facing conformation of abcc <dig>  and with ser <dig>  lys <dig>  ser <dig>  thr <dig> and asp <dig> in the outward-facing model. in the inward-facing abcc <dig> model, 5fdump was in interaction with ser <dig> and glu <dig>  while in the outward-facing model, it established only one hydrogen bond with gly <dig> 

an external abcc <dig> binding pocket  was located close to the extracellular space, and formed by tm <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in the inward-facing abcc <dig> model, cgmp could interact with glu <dig>  asn <dig> and trp <dig> while, in the outward-facing conformation, only two hydrogen bonds were observed with thr <dig> and val <dig>  suggesting less interactions. 5fdump could interact with trp <dig>  and asn <dig>  in the inward-facing model while gly <dig>  val <dig> and val <dig> were involved in interactions within the outward-facing model.

the local similarity does not exceed  <dig> % between binding sites of abcc <dig> and the correspondent residues in mabcb <dig>  between binding sites of abcc <dig> and the correspondent residues in sav <dig>  similarity does not go over  <dig> %. the similarity figures are sufficient but lower than those between abcc <dig> and its abcc <dig> homolog for example . this suggests that homology modeling permits the establishment of models respecting the binding pocket structure and thus the specificity of each protein for their substrate spectrum. this point supports the fact that docking experiments are reliable on these models of abcc <dig> 

the identification of two potential binding pockets strongly suggests that ligands can bind to two different sites. indeed, the qz59-sss cyclic peptide inhibitor showed two different binding sites in mouse mdr <dig> x-ray structure
 <cit> . based on docking analyses, mk <dig>  also bound efficiently to both sites in silico . this observation was strongly supported by the fact that mk <dig> is a competitive inhibitor of abcc1-mediated ltc <dig> transport
 <cit> . mk <dig> binding to one site would then not permit substrate transport. currently, no experimental data allows us to know if abcc <dig> substrates bind either simultaneously to both sites, randomly to each site, or preferentially to the internal or external site.

abcc <dig> residues potentially involved in substrate transport
because of their spatial position and putative interaction with ligands, many of the residues reported in figure 
 <dig> might be important for ligand binding. some residues might directly interact with substrate while others might be involved in allosteric modifications of abcc <dig> conformation and affect the substrate binding affinity. some of the residues constituting abcc <dig> pockets corresponded to residues described for abcc <dig> , the closest abcc member of abcc11
 <cit> . indeed, ravna et al. also described two putative binding pockets for cgmp. the first binding pocket of abcc <dig>  involving tm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  would correspond to one of the two binding pockets identified in abcc <dig> . the second abcc <dig> binding pocket was formed by tm <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  similarly to the second binding pocket described in abcc5
 <cit> . abcc <dig> thr <dig>  was located inside a binding site as well as its equivalent residues in abcc <dig>  and mouse abcb <dig> . some residues  found in the binding pockets are conserved between the two cgmp transporters, suggesting their putative function in drug binding and/or transport.

in the same manner, several residues identified in abcc <dig> substrate pockets also correspond to residues found in the substrate translocation chamber of abcc <dig> outward facing model of ravna et al. 
 <cit> . three of them are conserved between abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> . the majority of those residues were located in binding pockets of the outward facing model of abcc <dig>  as listed in figure 
 <dig>  several abcc <dig> residues identified near the bound ligand also have equivalent residues in the qz59-binding pocket of mouse abcb <dig>  in addition, ser <dig> corresponds to both abcc <dig> tyr1243
 <cit>  and abcb <dig> val982
 <cit>  described to be important for the transport function.

among those residues, it is important to note that thr <dig>  phe <dig>  asn <dig>  leu <dig> and thr <dig> have been described in abcb <dig>  abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> putative substrate binding pockets. and finally, some residues found in the drug-binding pockets have equivalents in other abc transporter that have been described to be essential for transport function: ile <dig> , phe <dig> , lys <dig> , pro <dig> , ile <dig> , abcb <dig> leu975
 <cit> ), arg <dig> , ala <dig>  and arg <dig> . altogether, these data confirm that our docking experiments were reliable enough to identify abcc <dig> drug binding pockets and suggest that abcb <dig>  abcc <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> would share a comparative location for their substrate binding pockets.

insight in the impact of glycine  <dig> polymorphism
gly <dig>  found to be inside pocket  <dig>  is prone to g602a snp  inducing the gly180arg mutation which was correlated to earwax type
 <cit> , and to colostrum and sweat secretion defaults
 <cit> . in addition, abcc11-arg <dig> mutant loses transport capacity toward cgmp
 <cit> , in agreement with gly <dig> location in our model, in close proximity to the ligand. in the inward-facing model, the gly <dig> side-chain points toward phospholipids, while it points toward cgmp in the outward-facing model. thus, it seems that gly <dig> could be in close contact with ligand only in the nucleotide-bound state where the drug-substrate is ready to be released. the altered transport of gly180arg-mutant abcc <dig> can be explained by the additional charge of arginine versus glycine. this may modify side-chain localization and consequently the binding site conformation. in the outward-facing state, this positive charge could also promote interactions with cgmp and decrease the efficiency of cgmp release into the extracellular space. toyoda et al. described a default of n-glycosylation proposed to induce protein degradation.
 <cit>  arg <dig> is thus likely modifying the proper folding of abcc <dig> rather than being directly involved in substrate binding.

conformational changes revealed by molecular dynamics simulations
we hypothesize that the substrate first binds to the intracellular side of transmembrane region and is then translocated to the extracellular side . molecular dynamics simulation was thus performed with the abcc <dig> inward facing model inserted into a phospholipid bilayer membrane . the calculated 1d root mean square deviation  on all heavy atoms is weak and evaluated at  <dig>  Å between the frame  <dig> to frame  <dig> . the 2d-rmsd allowed identifying four principals steady states during these 10 ns dynamics simulation . length of the molecular dynamics simulation is limited by the presence of phospholipid membrane and size of the protein . according to the molecular dynamics simulation, the inward-facing model gently changed its conformation. residues of the internal pocket  <dig> tended to move closer to each other, suggesting a closing of the bottom part of abcc <dig>  while residues of the external pocket  <dig> tended to move away from each other, suggesting by contrast an opening of the top part of abcc <dig> . these findings strongly suggested that substrate could enter the transporter from cytoplasm to bind into opened pocket  <dig> while pocket  <dig> is closed.

in the literature, chen et al. described the existence of two different binding sites in abcc <dig> for dheas and e2-17βg
 <cit> . they proposed that low concentrations of dheas had a stimulatory effect on abcc <dig> transport of e2-17βg because it would bind to a distinct site, whereas, at high concentration, dheas would rather compete with e2-17βg binding at the transport site. moreover, they observed that e2-17βg exerted an inhibitory effect on dheas transport by abcc <dig>  by consequence, the interaction between e2-17βg and dheas is not reciprocal, and do not respond to co-transport situation but rather to the existence of two binding sites. nevertheless, in the present study, we studied the transport of 5fdump and gmpc molecules that are structurally completely different. we suggested that these nucleotide derivatives make different interactions with the residues of abcc <dig> binding sites or bind distinct binding sites.

the molecular dynamics simulation of abcc <dig> partially simulate the transport cycle of abcc <dig>  our data suggested that substrate would cross the protein to bind to pocket  <dig> . subsequent conformational changes would open pocket  <dig> to allow substrate to reach the extracellular space and strongly support the presence of multiple allosteric substrate binding sites in abcc <dig> protein. the presence of possible allosteric interactions was supported by van aubel’s study
 <cit> . they suggested that abcc <dig> transports urate through a positive, cooperative allosteric interaction. urate changed cgmp transport from an allosteric to a single binding site. furthermore, they showed that camp and cgmp could be simultaneously transported with urate by abcc <dig>  under saturated conditions, suggesting multiple binding sites. at present, these experimental data are consistent with our hypothesis, which indicate that abcc <dig> substrates would bind to a first site and that conformation changes would allow binding to a second site before release and fully explained the 5fdump transport process.

CONCLUSIONS
thanks to homology modeling, we have provided two abcc <dig> models corresponding to different catalytic states. we could identify two putative binding pockets for substrates in both models, and recognized several residues that could interact with a bound substrate. these results constitute a useful tool for future biochemical experiments where the specific role of the identified residues could be study in vitro by site-directed mutagenesis experiments and transport activity characterization in cell expressing abcc <dig>  molecular dynamics simulation strongly helped us to visualize the putative cgmp and 5fdump mechanism of secretion. in addition to constitute a complementary tool in identifying the residues’ importance during transport process, they revealed new insights in abc transporter mechanism of efflux.
