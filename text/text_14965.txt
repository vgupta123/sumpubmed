BACKGROUND
genetic analysis of bovine milk fat has shown that there is heritable variation underlying the biosynthesis of bovine milk-fat . some fatty acids  are synthesized de novo in the mammary gland and are showing a moderate to high heritability, like e.g. short and medium chain saturated fa. in contrast, long chain fa are derived from blood lipids, which are originating from the diet and endogenously produced lipids. these long chain fa have, however, low to moderate heritabilities . identification of the genes underlying the genetic variation of the biosynthesis of milk fat would enhance the understanding of the biology of the fatty acid biosynthesis. polymorphisms in major genes like diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase  <dig>  and stearoyl-coa desaturase  have a large influence on the milk fat composition , however it has been shown that the biosynthesis of milk fat is a complicated process regulated by many genes  <cit> . this is supported by a genome wide association study  that has been published on milk fas in dutch dairy cattle showing that medium chain and unsaturated fa are strongly influenced by dgat and scd respectively, but other regions also showed significant association  <cit> .

poulsen et al.  <cit>  showed that there was a considerable difference between breeds in the milk fatty acid composition. the danish jersey  cows were characterized by higher levels of saturated short chain fa compared to the danish holstein , whereas the dh had higher content of unsaturated c <dig> fa  <cit> . furthermore, it was suggested that the content of c14: <dig> and c16: <dig> in the milk was mainly genetically regulated  <cit> . the differences between breeds could be due to the difference in their genetic background. it is likely that the same genes are involved in the biosynthesis of milk fa, but some processes may be pronounced due to the genetic background resulting in a different milk fat profile. screening the populations using a gwas approach, results in the underlying genomic regions and genes influencing the trait of interest  <cit> . furthermore, the results of the gwas can be used to search for genetic differences and similarities between different breeds as well as searching for the biological pathways involved in the trait of interest  <cit> .

the aim of this study was two-fold 1) perform a gwas using the bovine hd snp array in both the dh and dj breed in order to identify genomic regions in both breeds and identify similarities and differences between the breeds in the genetic regulation of milk fa and 2) identify the biological pathways underlying the fa biosynthesis based on the snp markers.

RESULTS
correlation between traits based on snp markers
the t-values of the association analysis were the basis to estimate the genetic correlation between the fa traits within breeds . there was a high correlation between the saturated short to medium chain fa  for the holstein breed. this high correlation was also observed between the groups of saturated short to medium chain fa  and the individual short to medium chain saturated fa. the long chain saturated fa c16: <dig> and c18: <dig> had a low or negative correlation with the long chain saturated fa. furthermore, there was a negative correlation between the unsaturated fa and the saturated fa. comparing the dh to the dj one can see that the correlation patterns within breed were similar  and that there was a high correlation between the trait correlations observed in the dh compared to the trait correlations observed in the dj .figure  <dig>

biological pathways detected for the danish holstein and danish jersey breeds
in the results for the biological pathways, we will focus on the traits, which showed which showed significant overlap between dh and dj in associated snps . furthermore, we only mention the biological pathways for each fatty acid with p <  <dig> . for the reader who is interested in the results of the other fa or groups of fa, we refer to additional file 3: table s <dig>  which presents the p-values for each biological kegg pathway for each fatty acid and groups of fa for both the dh and dj breed.

fat percentage
for dh,  <dig> different kegg pathways were significant at the p <  <dig>  level, whereas  <dig> kegg pathways were significant for dj . the two breeds had the two most significant pathways in common: kegg <dig> fat digestion and absorption  and kegg <dig> retinol metabolism .

c <dig> index
for c <dig> index,  <dig> kegg pathways were significant for the dh, whereas  <dig> kegg pathways were significant for dj at the p <  <dig>  level . in total, six kegg pathways were in common between dh and dj: kegg <dig> tyrosine metabolism , kegg <dig> phenylalanine metabolism , kegg <dig> phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis , kegg <dig> folate biosynthesis , kegg <dig> graft-versus-host disease , kegg <dig> primary immunodeficiency .

c14:1
for c14: <dig>   <dig> kegg pathways were significant for dh, whereas  <dig> kegg pathways were significant for dj at the p <  <dig>  level . there is however little overlap between breeds. the two breeds had two pathways in common: kegg <dig> tyrosine metabolism  and kegg <dig> phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis .

c <dig> index
out of the  <dig> significant kegg pathways for dh and  <dig> significant kegg pathways for dj , only kegg <dig> nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism  and kegg <dig> natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity  were in common between the two breeds.

c16:1
for c16: <dig>   <dig> kegg pathways were significant for dh and  <dig> kegg pathways were significant for dj at the p <  <dig>  level . however, only kegg <dig> ether lipid metabolism pathway  was in common between the two breeds.

discussion
in this study we have performed a gwas in two independent breeds  with the intention to learn more about the underlying genetic architecture of individual fa in bovine milk. a previous study based on the same data showed that the dh and the dj breeds have a different fatty acid profile of the milk  <cit> . it has been shown that some of the fa are more regulated by the environment , while the regulation of other fa  is more influenced by genetics  <cit> . as the fa differing between the dh and dj belong to both groups  <cit> , it would be of interest to compare the genetic architecture of the two breeds to identify differences and similarities between the breeds in the genetic regulation of fa in the milk.

genome-wide association comparison to other studies
recently, a gwa study on dutch holstein cattle was published using the 50 k bovine snp array identifying  <dig> regions on  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . ten fa  were measured in our study as well as in bouwman et al.  <cit> . however, there was little overlap between the qtl found in bouwman et al.  <cit>  and in our study for these fa. for dh, significant snp markers were detected for c14: <dig>  c16: <dig> and cla on the same chromosomes as detected by bouwman et al.  <cit> . the most surprising difference with the results of bouwman et al.  <cit>  was that in our study we did not detect significant association for c16: <dig> on bta <dig> and for c14: <dig> on bta <dig>  looking in more detail only markers for c14: <dig> on bta <dig>  and bta <dig> , and markers for c16: <dig> on bta <dig>  were overlapping with bouwman et al.  <cit> . the snp markers detected for c10: <dig>  c14: <dig>  c16: <dig> in dj had overlap with the study of bouwman et al.  <cit>  on bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  for c10: <dig>  bta <dig>  for c14: <dig>  and on bta <dig> , and bta <dig>  for c16: <dig> 

in german holstein cattle, four main qtl have been detected explaining  <dig> % of the estimated breeding value for fp. the four qtl  were located on bta <dig> , bta <dig> , bta <dig>  and bta <dig> , respectively  <cit> . in our study, we identified for both the dh and dj significant markers on bta <dig> and bta <dig> for fp, but not for bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig> 

the main difference between the studies of bouwman et al.  <cit>  and wang et al.  <cit>  and our study is 1) the study populations used in bouwman et al.  <cit>  and wang et al.  <cit>  are more than four times as big as our study populations. this would mean that the power to detect smaller qtl is larger compared to our study, 2) the studies of bouwman et al.  <cit>  and wang et al.  <cit>  used the 50 k bovine snp array, while our study we used the bovine hd snp array. an increased number of markers would increase the power to detect a qtl, 3) the significance threshold used in the different studies is different. bouwman et al.  <cit>  used a threshold of –log ≥  <dig>  while wang et al.  <cit>  used a threshold of –log >  <dig>  . the fdr correction for multiple testing indicated a snp marker to be significant when -log ≥  <dig> , in our study. this significance level is between the aforementioned studies. based on the different significance levels it is expected that our study would find a smaller number of significantly associated snps compared to bouwman et al.  <cit> , and a larger number of significantly associated snps compared to wang et al.  <cit> . these differences between the studies may be the reason why there is relatively little overlap between studies.

in our study we used the gc method to identify the fa profile in the milk on a relatively small number of animals. we used the gc method was because this is an accurate method to determine the fatty acid content in the milk. to increase the number of animals the gc method is suitable but expensive in use and is therefore less suitable to screen large numbers of animals. an alternative method would be mid-infrared  spectrometry to assess the detailed fa profile in the milk  <cit> . in some countries this method has been extended to measure detailed fa profiles on a regular basis and genetic parameters for specific fa based on mir spectrometry has been published  <cit> .

candidate genes located in the qtl
dgat1
the dgat <dig> enzyme plays an important role in triacylglycerol synthesis by catalyzing the esterification of a fatty acyl-coa to the sn- <dig> position of a diacylglycerol. the dgat <dig> gene is located on bta <dig>  and it has been shown that a polymorphism in the dgat <dig> gene explains the qtl for milk yield and composition  <cit> . in our study, dgat <dig> shows association to c16: <dig> and fp explaining  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total variance, respectively for dh and in dj, dgat <dig> was associated with c16: <dig> explaining  <dig> % of the total variance. this is in line with the literature, where it has been shown that dgat <dig> is underlying large genetic variation in milk fat composition traits, among these traits were milk fp, c14: <dig>  c16: <dig>  and cla  <cit> . furthermore, it was shown that dgat <dig> is associated with desaturation indexes in dutch holstein and italian brown cattle  <cit> . in our study however we did not find any association with dgat <dig> and desaturation indexes.

scd
the scd <dig> enzyme catalyzes the conversion of c10: <dig> to c18: <dig> saturated fatty acid into their mono-unsaturated counterparts. the scd <dig> gene is located on bta <dig> and is associated with milk fatty acid composition . in our study, we have detected associations with scd for c14: <dig> and the c <dig> index for dh and for the c <dig> index for dj. especially for the c <dig> index we found strong association with scd in both breeds, explaining a large part of the total variance,  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively. however we did not detect any association with scd and the other indices. mele et al.  <cit>  and conte et al.  <cit>  also detected association between scd and c <dig> index and did not find association to other desaturase indexes in italian holstein and italian brown cattle, respectively. on the contrary, schennink et al.  <cit>  detected association between scd and six different desaturatase indexes of which scd explained the largest part of the genetic variation for the c <dig> index . the size of the study of schennink et al.  <cit>  is much larger compared to our study and the studies by mele et al.  <cit>  and conte et al.  <cit>  and therefore has a higher power to detect associations. the association of scd with the c <dig> index has now been confirmed in three different breeds . as c14: <dig> is almost solely derived from de novo synthesis in the mammary gland it is likely that almost all the c14: <dig> c- <dig> is synthesized by scd
 <cit> .

acss3
acyl-coa synthetase short-chain family member isoforms  have been shown to play a role in activation and intracellular channeling of fa. gene expression studies have shown that acss <dig> had greater abundance and up-regulation in mrna expression than acss <dig> during lactation in the mammary gland  <cit> . furthermore it has been shown that acss <dig> is located in a chromosomal region associated to c6: <dig>  c8: <dig>  c10: <dig>  c14: <dig>  and c16: <dig>  <cit> . in our study, however, we did not detect any association with acss <dig>  but we detected association on bta <dig> between acss <dig> and c10: <dig> and c15: <dig> in dj. acss <dig> is related to acetate-coa ligase activity and the propanoate metabolism playing a role together with acss <dig> and acss <dig> in the conversion of propanoyl-coa via proionyladenylate into propanoate . furthermore the most significant snp located in acss <dig> explains  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total variance for c10: <dig> and c15: <dig> respectively. this makes acss <dig> a good candidate gene for milk-fat composition.

comparison danish holstein and danish jersey
the genetic correlations between the fatty acid and groups of fa showed the same pattern in both dh and dj. this is a first indication that the underlying genetics of the regulation of fa in the breeds is similar. the overlap of snps associated with the individual fa and groups of fa in the two breeds showed that there was a strong indication that the same causal or linked variants were involved in the regulation of fp, c <dig> index, c16: <dig>  c <dig> index and c14: <dig>  in addition, there was also an indication that the same snps which showed and association in both dh and dj were involved c <dig> index, c18: <dig>  cla and c13: <dig> . the fact that the same snp markers are significant for specific fa in the two breeds, strengthen the suggestion that the fa in these breeds are regulated by the same genes. however, due to the fact that the sample size in this study is relatively low, we cannot state that the non-significant p-values for the overlap for marker between dh and dj for c6: <dig> to c <dig> indicates that there are different genetic mechanisms influencing these fa in the two breeds.

biological pathways
so far biological pathways in relation to milk fat production in cattle have been studied by looking at the gene expression of genes known to play a role in the fat metabolism by qpcr  <cit> . based on the mrna expression of  <dig> genes a network among genes involved in fat synthesis has been developed  <cit> . by using rna-seq, it was shown that genes involved in the fat metabolism pathway had high expression in milk somatic cells during transition and peak period of the lactation  <cit> . these studies show that the production of milk fat in the mammary gland can be divided into five distinct processes: fatty acid uptake, de novo fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid desaturation, fatty acid esterification and milk fat secretion  <cit> .

previously, it has been shown that gene-set enrichment approaches based on snp associations is a valuable tool to get additional biological information from a gwa study  <cit> . in this paper, we have used a statistical modeling approach that evaluates the collective action of sets of snps on the trait phenotypes. the approach was used to identify genes and biological pathways to the milk traits.

based on the results for the biological pathway analysis for fp, c <dig> index, c <dig> index, c14: <dig> and c16: <dig>  it is clear that there is overlap of biological pathways between the dh and dj. furthermore, some biological pathways are showing up for multiple traits. however, this is expected as the desaturase indices  are a function of c14: <dig> and c16: <dig>  respectively.

the biological pathway ‘fat digestion and absorption’ kegg <dig> is significant for fp, c14: <dig>  c <dig> index and c16: <dig>  the pathway describes the fat uptake from blood and the digestion process in the intestine in human . genes involved in this pathway  are however, also expressed in the mammary gland and play a role in e.g. fatty acid uptake from blood , synthesis of tag , and intra cellular channeling   <cit> . or in more detail: cd <dig> and fabp have been categorized as being involved in the fatty acid transport  <cit> , agpat and dgat have been categorized as being involved in the esterification  <cit> . these processes are described by kegg <dig> in relation to the fat digestion and absorption in the human intestines. short- and medium-chain saturated fa and about half the amount of c16: <dig> are produced de novo. a small part of c14: <dig> and c16: <dig> in the milk is desaturated to c14: <dig> and c16: <dig> by scd1
 <cit> . the long-chain fa and about half of c16: <dig> are taken up through the diet or can be released from adipose tissues from the cow. the long chain fas are biohydrogenated into different intermediate products before these are absorbed in the mammary gland in two steps: 1) from the rumen into the blood stream, 2) from the blood stream into the mammary gland. these steps fit well with the biological process described in kegg <dig> 

interestingly, the pathway called ‘phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis’  was among the significant for c <dig> index and c14: <dig> in both dh and dj. studying the biological process behind this pathway showed that tyrosine can be degraded via a number of steps into fumarate and acetoacetate. acetoacetate is a ketone body, which can be converted into acetyl-coa, a precursor for the fatty acid synthesis.

it is clear that several cancer and immune response related pathways were significant for dj compared to dh. how these biological pathways relate directly to the fatty acid production in the milk is unclear at this stage. furthermore a few biological pathways like linoleic acid metabolism , α-linoleic acid metabolism  are related to the formation of fat, but it is not directly clear how these relate to the c16: <dig> and c14: <dig> fatty acid formation. however, the pathways described in human regarding fat are based on knowledge about body fat instead of milk-fat. in general the results of the method showed that even though the method reveals the most likely biological pathway , it shows that there are also some considerations to be taken into account: 1) in general cancer and immune related pathways are better annotated compared to other type of pathways as these have a larger focus in research. 2) it is clear that assigning 700 k snps to genes on the cattle genome would mean that we will lose some genes to be assigned to the different biological pathway groups. this could be improved by using full sequence information. 3) the significance of the biological pathway groups are based on the t-values corresponding to the snps assigned to the genes. due to the different ld structure between dh and dj, the t-values can differ for the snps between dh and dj and thereby different biological pathways can be significant for the same trait in the two breeds.

CONCLUSIONS
there was a clear similarity between the genetics of the formation of fa in the milk between dh and dj. this was supported by the fact that there was substantial overlap between snps for fp, c <dig> index, c14: <dig>  c <dig> index and c16: <dig>  in addition, genetic correlations between fa showed a similar pattern across dh and dj. furthermore the biological pathway analysis suggested that fat digestion and absorption kegg <dig> is important for the traits fp, c14: <dig>  c <dig> index and c16: <dig>
