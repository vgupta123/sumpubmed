BACKGROUND
gene-encoded anti-microbial peptides  are widespread in nature, and are essential lines of host defence against pathogens. these peptides are evidently less susceptible to bacterial resistance than traditional antibiotics, and could form the basis for a new class of therapeutic agents  <cit> . as eukaryotes, plants have innate amp defense that usually consists of small cys- or glycine-rich peptides that are effective against a variety of pathogens. the main classes of amps are represented by the alpha/beta-defensins, lipid-transfer proteins , thionins, cyclotides, snakins, and hevein-like proteins according to their amino acid sequence homologies  <cit> . interestingly, a series of novel plant amps has been discovered as processed forms of large proteins. plant amps provide novel strategies not only in therapeutic use, but can also potentially increase agricultural yields through phytopathogen or pest control  <cit> .

to date, in spite of the increasing number of reported amps from plants, developments in gene expression methodologies and computational algorithms lead to new prospective strategies of biomining amps in plant systems. computational and bioinformatics approaches has allowed the application of silico-associated molecular tools aiming to screen and identify novel potential candidates that code for these peptides, starting from substantial amounts of genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and other ‘-omics’ data from various cultivated or wild plants  <cit> . expressed sequence tag  databases are increasing in number and size, especially regarding cultivated plants  <cit> . currently, more than  <dig> million ests are available through the dbest entry of genbank . as expected, crop species have been more frequently targeted for amp research and application due to the highly available molecular data  <cit> . recent bioinformatics analyses of sequenced plant genomes have revealed a previously unrecognized abundance of genes encoding amps  <cit> .

b. napus is one of the most important oil crops worldwide, providing a challenge for understanding innate immune systems and resistances to phytopathogens in brassicaceae plants. the large number of est sequences of b. napus provides a timely opportunity to discover a complete repertoire of amp sequences. candidate amp-coding genes identified from in silico approaches require further biological validation. in this study, after bioinformatics analysis of potential amp genes from three different b. napus est databases, an effective method has been performed for large-scale validation of the biological activities of these candidate amp genes  <cit> .

RESULTS
est-based search for discovery of novel b. napus amps
in this study, a general search aiming to identify amps was performed on three different b. napus est databases including:  <dig>  ests generated from immature seeds of two rapeseed lines  <cit> ;  <dig>  ests generated from an cdna library which was constructed from mixed mrnas of b. napus leaves inoculated with s. sclerotiorum or treated with chemicals benzothiadiazole , methyl jasmonate , or oxalic acid ;  <dig>  ests downloaded from the est database of plantgdb . after screening for low-quality dna and trimming the vector sequences, the three est datasets were clustered and produced unigenes using cap <dig> program respectively . to identify novel amp genes in the b. napus, all the known amps from the amp databank  were individually queried first in the three unigene datasets using the blastx program  <cit>  . a total of  <dig> unigenes from b. napus leaves that were matched to the known amp genes had the highest ratio  in this unigene dataset, which is  <dig> times that of the unigene datasets of b. napus seeds  and  <dig>  times that of the public est dataset .table  <dig> summary of expressed sequence tags  from the four origins







analysis of ests related to amp
a total of  <dig> unigenes that matched the  <dig> known amp sequences were extracted and annotated with gene ontology  terms and the blast result against the swissprot database with an e value cut-off that was equal to or less than 10− <dig> using blast2go program . among these unigenes, roughly 90 % of each est library was ltp , defensin , histone , endochitinase , and gibberellin-regulated protein  . the most abundant unigenes in the leaf library were the endochitinase and defensin genes, which were different from ltp and histone in the pub est library .table  <dig> annotation of unigenes hit to amp database



after deleting the redundant sequences with 100 % sequence identity,  <dig> peptide sequences were found, matching the different amp families . all the sequences were new, except for one defensin gene that was completely similar to amp rs-afp <dig> .table  <dig> the number of potential amp sequence and families



phylogeny and motif analysis
 <dig> potential amps were aligned via clustalw to construct the unrooted phylogenetic tree using the maximum-likelihood algorithm with  <dig> bootstrap replicates . six groups of known amp families were found, including the most abundant types  ltp, defensin-like peptides , snakin , hipposin , hevein , and thionin.  <dig> peptides belong to other unknown families are also found in b. napus.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship of all potential amps. a multiple sequence alignment of  <dig> potential amps was used to calculate a matrix with the genetic distances for each pair of the sequences. based on this matrix, successive clustering of lineages was done to construct the unrooted phylogenetic tree of all potential amps gene using the maximum-likelihood algorithm with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. only branches supported by a bootstrap value of at least 50 % are indicated. tree was generated using jalview  <cit> . the tree includes  <dig> sequences, and therefore only major nodes and global clusters are depicted. the labeling of the subfamilies is based on the location of amps that have experimentally confirmed function



each of the resulting rough set of amps family sequence subgroups was separately realigned via clustalw and visualized using jalview  <cit> . defensins are small  cysteine-rich peptides and consists of a cystine-stabilized αβ fold, in which the buried hydrophobic core is formed by four disulfide bridges that link pairs of the eight conserved cysteines . the defensin-like peptides  of b. napus have four distinct clusters . all clusters have eight conserved cys residue motifs forming four disulfide bonds. the evolutionary history of one dlp cluster candidate was reconstructed with mega <dig>  <cit>  at the protein level . multiple alignment of this dlp cluster revealed that the consensus pattern c-x5-c-x3-c-x9-c-x6-c-x-c in defensin domain were highly conserved as typically observed in 1ti <dig>  from vigna radiata.fig.  <dig> comparison of amino acid sequences of some defensin-like. evolutionary relationship is depicted left. linked bars representing the disulfide bonds arrangement denoted by: c1-c8; c2-c5; c3-c6; c4-c <dig>  blue helix and arrow respectively represent alpha-helix and beta-strand, which are extracted from the model structure of .  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  . numbers at the base of each clade correspond to bootstrap means at  <dig> replications



ltps are stabilized by eight conserved cys residues forming four disulfide bonds, and have a potential glycophosphatidylinositol modification site and a defined number of residues between each two of the eight conserved cys residues . ltps are categorized into five types or clades by comparison of the ltp genes within and among individual plant species  <cit> . type i ltps and their derivatives are the basic and ubiquitous clades. the major ltps in b. napus belong to ltp type i , with a hydrophilic residue such as arginine, glutamate, or lysine at the × position of cxc motif  . snakin amino acid sequence alignments  indicate that in addition to the  <dig> characterized cys motif, the arginine, valine, and proline residues are highly conserved throughout the family  <cit> . b. napus hevein-like peptide sequences are about  <dig> amino acids to  <dig> amino acids long and possess eight unique cys in a chitin-binding peptide with several strictly conserved residues, serine, and two glycines   <cit> . b. napus thionin has six conserved cys residues, as well as conserved proline and glycine residues   <cit> . a variable number of cys residues that helped stabilize conserved scaffolds through disulfide bond formation were found  <cit> . b. napus hipposin  sequence had a proline hinge without cys residues  . in addition, a type of proline-and glycine-rich peptide was found, which was similar to animal amps and has not been previously reported .

production of fusion proteins with amps via a fusion partner eddie
to investigate the antimicrobial activities of the predicted peptides,  <dig> potential amp genes that belong to different amp families were selected to test their antimicrobial activities after bioinformatics identification . the amp genes were optimized according to e. coli codon usage and synthetized through one-step polymerase chain reaction  technique . to recover their original activities without additional amino acid residues, each pcr production of amps genes was cloned into a unique vector with eddie as a fusion partner via an in vivo recombination strategy  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pcr production of amp genes prepared for expression vector construction. lane m: molecular mass makers; lane 1–31: pcr production of amp genes from bn <dig> to bn31



the pet30a/his-eddie-amp plasmids were transformed into the expressing host and cultured under optimized conditions. after the induction by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside , the expression of his-eddie-amp proteins was analyzed using sds–page . fusion proteins of about 20 kda represented the majority of the insoluble components in the cell lysates. the recombinant his-eddie-amps were produced as inclusion bodies because of the properties of the fusion partner.fig.  <dig> sds–page analysis of recombinant his-eddie-amps expressed in e. coli bl <dig> . lane m: the molecular weight markers; lane 1: crude cells extracts of uninduced e. coli bl <dig> containing pet-his-eddie-amp; lane 2–18: crude cells extracts after 5 h past the induction with iptg of e. coli bl <dig> containing pet-his-eddie-amp. arrows indicate the bands of fusion proteins of about 20 kda



generation of amps and their activity test
purified his-eddie-amp inclusion bodies were diluted in optimized refolding buffer. after in vitro refolding, the fusion partner was released from the c-terminal end of the autoprotease through self-cleavage, leaving the amps with an authentic n terminus. to examine the antimicrobial activities of the recombinant amps, the purified supernatants were analysed using radial diffusion assay. in fig.  <dig>  a total of  <dig> recombinant amps were clearly bioactive and significantly effective in destroying the sensitive strains , but no inhibition zones were seen around the negative control spots. among these amps, three amps have only antimicrobial activities to gram negative strains and other three amps have only antimicrobial activities to gram positive strains. bn <dig> have the highest activities to gram positive and negative strains among these  <dig> amps.fig.  <dig> detection of the antibacterial activities of candidate antimicrobial peptides against e. coli and m. luteus. r: refolding buffer; a antimicrobial activities assay against e. coli; b antimicrobial activities assay against m. luteus; the number in plate from  <dig> to  <dig> indicated the name of amps from bn <dig> to bn <dig>  the letter “r” in the center of plate indicated the refolding buffer as the control



the antifungal activity assay for  <dig> recombinant purified amps with antibacterial activities to gram positive or negative strains was carried out with s. sclerotiorum strains, a main agronomically phytopathogen of b. napus. as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the growth of the tested filamentous fungal strain was inhibited by  <dig> amps, but it can grow normally with bn <dig> and the control refolding buffer.fig.  <dig> detection of the antifungal activities of candidate antimicrobial peptides against s. sclerotiorum. in the plate containing pda medium, a mycelial plug was placed in the center. the name of amps are indicated upon every plate from bn <dig> to pda medium, a mycelial plug was placed in the center. the name of amps are indicated upon every plate from bn <dig> to bn <dig>  the letter “a, b” in the plates indicated wells with the refolding buffer as the control, “c, d” indicated wells with antimicrobial peptide samples



a total of  <dig> amps, including nine heveins, five defensins, three hipposins, three thionins, three snakins, and four ltps, showed activities against sensitive strains. a new amp sequence bn <dig> with rich proline residues similar to sp-b   <cit>  was classified as a new member of the proline-rich antimicrobial peptide family.

discussion
by using integrated computational approaches to systemically mine the b. napus est sequence, the first b. napus amp repertoire was established. the members exhibit extensive sequence and structural diversity, and can be distinguished into multiple molecular types. the  <dig> b. napus non-redundant amps were organized in seven subfamily types, namely, dlps with cys-stabilized alpha-helical and beta-sheet  fold, ltp, thionin, hipposin, hevein peptide, snakin, and proline- or glycine-rich peptides  <cit> . results of the bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses of the primary structures of the b. napus candidates support their role as antimicrobials. furthermore, the cys motif characteristics and other conserved residues of the main amp families, such as defensin, thionin, and ltp gene families, were summarized.

amp candidate genes are more substantially abundant in b. napus leaves in response to the pathogene  and signaling compounds compared with b. napus seeds and public est dataset. the most abundant unigenes in the leaf library are endochitinase-derived hevein and defensin genes, indicating that these genes are necessary in the protection against potential pathogen, defensins and other amps often expressed in an organ- or tissue-specific manner.

most of the candidate peptide sequences are new amp genes that have no proven antimicrobial activities. flowering plants have been previously shown to possess large gene families encoding ltps  <cit> . the results in this research also show that ltp is the most abundance type in b. napus. next to their inducibility upon pathogen infection, ltp genes are also responsive to abiotic stresses like drought, cold and salt  <cit> , and perhaps necessary for pollen adherence to the stigma during pollen elongation in some flowering plants  <cit> . a defensin from cowpea seeds was assessed on its putative alpha-amylase inhibitory action probably involved in protection against pests  <cit> .

in this study, an efficient method was used for cloning and expressing amp genes. this expression system is more efficient and is very useful for constructing genome-scale clone resources that facilitate amp functional analysis. this approach, coupled with bioinformatics analyses of the genome and est sequence data, will be useful in screening for new amps. such tools may contribute in overcoming problems associated with yield, storage, and processing, thereby improving crop resistance and providing novel strategies not only in medicine but can potentially increase agricultural yields by phytopathogen or pest control.

thirty-one potential amps in this study were detected and  <dig> of them were confirmed to be novel amps of b. napus using antibacterial activity assay. this finding indicates that large amp genes are still undiscovered.  <dig> amp candidate genes were also approved with strong activities to control the main fungal pathogens of b. napus, s. sclerotiorum. these amps will be further proved in enhanced crop resistance to pathogen attack through genetic breeding and transgenic manipulation in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides new insights and fundamental information on b. napus amp gene families. based on their existence in natural host defence systems and their different modes of actions relative to commercial antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides represent new hope in discovering novel antibiotics against multi-resistant bacteria.
