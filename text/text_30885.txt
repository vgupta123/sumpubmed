BACKGROUND
tes and their abundant relics are found in the genome of almost all organisms and are classified into many distinct families based on sequence features and transposition mechanisms  <cit> . dna transposons generally exhibit cut-and-paste transposition, while retrotransposons use an rna intermediate and thus transpose using a copy-and-paste mechanism. retro-elements are further divided into two subclasses, depending on the presence or absence of long terminal repeats . the biological role of tes has been the subject of great controversy, and although they had been assimilated to “selfish” or “junk” dna for some time  <cit> , they are now recognized as important factors in the evolution of genome structure and function  <cit> . indeed, it has been estimated that mobilization of ltr-retrotransposons is responsible for up to one tenth of spontaneous germ line mutations  <cit>  in laboratory mice. similarly, mobilization of the human line <dig>  non-ltr retrotransposon was found to account for 19% of the structural variation between individual genomes  <cit> , and has been linked to over a hundred human diseases  <cit> . in plants, bursts of te mobilization are responsible for the large differences in genome size that are sometimes observed between closely related species  <cit> .

with the advent of ngs technologies, it is now conceivable to re-sequence whole genomes in order to computationally characterize te mobilization in a systematic way. however, this task is complicated by the inherently repetitive nature of te sequences and by their frequent clustering in parts of the genome. over the past years, several tools have been developed specifically for the detection of newly mobilized tes in re-sequenced genomes  <cit> . however these tools have strong limitations. first, they all rely on prior annotation or knowledge of the te sequence, making the detection of un- or mis-annotated te impossible. in the same way, single transpositions involving several adjacent elements  and transposition of truncated tes, as frequently observed in human genomes  <cit> , are difficult to identify using such methods. moreover, many existing tools only deal with tes that create target site duplication  during transposition events  <cit> , or are restricted to the analysis of the human genome  or only detect the presence/absence of a te . finally, although several methods also attempt to identify the donor te sequence, this identification is often limited to the subfamily level  <cit> . therefore, exhaustive and de-novo discovery of mobilization of un- or mis-annotated tes can only be attempted using generic sv detection tools. four broad types of such methods have been described over the past few years. they are based on the analysis of either  depth of coverage,  split reads,  discordant paired reads, or else on  de novo assembly  <cit> . type  methods give a quantitative measure of the number of extra te copies but do not provide information about their location. type  and  methods identify one-sided events in the form of clusters of anomalously mapped reads, but they do not combine these one-sided events to produce bona fide te insertions. finally, the heavy computational burden of type  methods, as well as their poor performance with repetitive sequences, preclude their use for large-scale detection of new te insertions  <cit> . more recently, several programs have attempted to adopt an integrative approach by combining results from several methods  <cit> , but their precision statistic is still typically low when considering specific types of structural variation . major drawbacks of these general-purpose tools are the fact that they produce a high number of non-te predictions, and that none of these tools can identify the donor te and provide the complete sequence of transposed copies.

here, we present te-tracker, a new method dedicated to the systematic and robust identification of newly mobilized tes in genomes resequenced using illumina paired-end fragments. te-tracker is able to detect transposition of composite, un- or mis-annotated tes. moreover te-tracker includes a donor-scoring feature, which makes it able to detect both the identity and destination of tes. we use te-tracker to provide a comprehensive view of transposition events induced by loss of dna methylation in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
the te-tracker pipeline
te-tracker is divided into three independent modules: eris, leto and metis . te-tracker starts with the eris module detecting discordant read pairs , i.e. pairs that map in unexpected orientation or location with respect to the preparation and insert size, which can constitute evidence of a transposition event. first, alignments are filtered based on mapping quality and then a random sample of the read pairs is used to estimate the insert size distribution. median and median absolute deviation  thresholds are used to mark as discordant the pairs for which the read mates map with an unexpected insert size . pairs mapping on different chromosomes or in an unexpected orientation with respect to the sequencing library are flagged discordant as well. when multiple mappings are available for either mate of one pair, the pair is considered discordant only if all combinations of mate mappings match the aforementioned discordance criteria; in which case all potential mappings are recorded as if they were unique mappings from separate read pairs .figure  <dig> 
te-tracker overview, main steps of the te-tracker pipeline.

te-tracker main algorithms. a. discordant pairs around insertion breakpoint. sequenced reads around a newly inserted te-copy  produce discordant read mappings when aligned onto the reference sequence where the newly inserted copy only exists at the locus of origin . the thin black line represents the sequenced dna fragment, the thick black line represents a transposon of interest. yellow and orange arrows represent the left and right extremities of the insertion breakpoint, linked arrows represent paired-end reads. grey reads will be normally mapped, while colored reads will be mapped discordantly, the color indicates a type of discordance . b. clustering of discordant pairs. discordant reads of the same type are isolated and sorted . both ends must be sufficiently close for two read pairs to be clustered together, but sorting of the left end, combined with a random insert size results in different thresholds for clustering both ends. pairs are clustered according to the single-linkage method , which represent read pairs as edges on a graph . a point is added to a cluster if its distance to any other point already in the graph meets both thresholds when projected on both axes. c. cluster merging. local drops in read coverage break clusters, corrupting insertion signals. a proximity threshold is applied to merge neighboring clusters of the same type and orientation. local coverage is represented by a grey curve on top of the sequence, while linked colored arrows represent clusters of read pairs. d. calling. the four types of transposition events detected by te-tracker along with their associated cluster signatures, with an emphasis on the overlap condition used to assemble clusters with compatible signatures into bona fide events.



once discordant read pairs are extracted, they are clustered using the leto module. the aim of this step is to regroup discordant pairs that might support the same transposition event while discarding lone pairs that are most certainly due to mapping errors. clustering is done using single-linkage clustering in the mate-position space. pairs are classified according to read orientation as well as the chromosome each mate maps on; hence for every such couple of chromosomes, each discordant pair can be represented in a two-coordinate system, making it easy to compute the respective distance between the right and left mates of any two read pairs. clusters are built by adding pairs that are close enough to any pair already in a cluster. because the read pairs are sorted by position, and because only the first encountered mate is ordered when sorting paired-end reads, the distance requirements for the clustering differ for both dimensions. intuitively, the distance requirement on the ordered mate side is smaller than on the unordered mate side, since it is determined by the coverage distribution, whereas in the latter case distance is influenced by the insert size distribution, which typically has a larger variance . these two values constitute the main parameters of the te-tracker software. in order to maximize the number of detected events, leto will scan several values for both of these clustering parameters and merge clusters that are found more than once. like discordant pairs, clusters are then classified into several types , according to their orientation and mapping chromosome for each mate .

clustering algorithms are generally memory-intensive when run over a large number of points; in particular, it is known that the optimal performance of the single-linkage algorithm used in te-tracker is Ο where n is the number of points  <cit> . in an omics context, this will result in increased computational load proportional to the number of discordant reads, either because of larger genomes or higher sequencing depth. for te-tracker, we choose to favor speed at the expense of memory use. for performance optimization, we developed a seed-type heuristic that reduces the amount of pairs in memory to a fraction of the total number . furthermore, at any given time, read mate mappings that belong to different pairs of chromosomes and are mapped in a specific orientation are considered independently and sequentially, which implies that performance of te-tracker will not depend on overall genome size/sequencing depth but on the average sequence size/sequencing depth for individual chromosomes. hence, discordant reads are subdivided in up to 4×k <dig> chunks where k is the number of chromosomes. this is why performance evaluation for a pair of two chromosomes from a given species can be considered to reflect performance over that species’ genome as a whole.

once clusters of mate pairs are formed, leto attempts to merge neighboring ones  and then proceeds to call transposition events. merging clusters is required because in regions of low coverage, the discordant read count will often be too low to allow clustering. therefore, sudden drops in coverage can split large sets of discordant pairs into several clusters with identical signatures. once these gaps are filled, knowledge of the dynamics of transposition and its influence on sequencing data  <cit>  allow us to select only the combinations of cluster types that are likely to indicate a transposition event . then the program considers every combination of clusters belonging to these specific types and determines whether they could underline a true event . for example, it takes advantage of the fact that, when the library insert size is large enough compared to the size of a mobilized sequence, the clusters anchored on the transposon side  will partly overlap over the middle of the te. on the insertion site side however the corresponding ends of both clusters will be close, but will not overlap because all the reads overlapping the exact insertion site will have been left unmapped. this type of signature is a much stronger indication of a novel te insertion than cluster proximity alone, and by applying this heuristic we manage to dramatically reduce false positive rates when calling mobilization events. the fact that te-tracker reconstitutes the sequence of the inserted transposon using overlapping reads allows it to fully exploit the fragment size of the sequencing library. as a result, the size of the tes for which te-tracker can detect insertions and determine the donor copy is dependent on the sequencing protocol. briefly, te-tracker is able to analyze mobilization of tes that are up to 2l in length, where l is the mean size of dna fragments used for sequencing . for example, in order to fully characterize the transposition landscape of alu elements in the human genome , te-tracker would require a short fragment paired-end library of 150 bp mean length, whereas longer, recircularized fragments  would have to be used for larger elements.

this analysis pipeline is not unlike the one used in some previous tools  <cit> , in that it is the final heuristics step that allows incorporating constraints on clusters based on biological knowledge of insertion mechanisms. key differences are the fact that te-tracker incorporates information from all mappings of a given read pair including mismatches, and that the heuristic is based on overlap of clusters alone, rather than ploidy and previous knowledge of te donor sites.

for each pair of clusters passing the filter, te-tracker reports the acceptor and donor sites as defined by the cluster boundaries, the number of reads supporting the insertion event, the overlap size and whether the te has been reversed during transposition.

finally, it is possible to annotate the output file with various data using the metis module. if annotation data is available, both the acceptor and donor regions can be annotated; this is performed using the readily available bedtools software suite  <cit> . metis is also able to read a discordant bam file such as the one produced by the eris module to perform donor-scoring. since te-tracker analyzes all multiple mappings of discordant pairs, it is able to report all potential donor sites for a given transposition event. however, te families typically contain mostly defective copies that are unable to be mobilized because of truncations or other mutations in their coding or regulatory sequences. nonetheless, potentially mobile copies are difficult to predict on the basis of sequence integrity alone, and there are no programs to date that attempt to identify those that transpose among potential candidates. given that te families may contain several mobile copies that differ from each other by a few sequence polymorphisms, we have included in te-tracker a donor-scoring feature, which selects within clusters only those reads that contain discriminating polymorphisms . discordant reads anchoring at the acceptor site on one side, and at every potential donor on the other, are extracted from the input alignment file. reads that map indifferently to all the donors are discarded, while those that map significantly better on one donor than on all the others are assigned to that donor and subsequently counted. a better mapping score on one donor location indicates coverage of a polymorphism specific to that particular te sequence, hence the count of those specific reads for each donor represents a “specificity” or “certainty score” for that particular acceptor/donor pair. this feature aims to provide evidence in identifying the “real” donor when several candidate are available. a donor with a higher score is generally synonymous with higher specificity for that particular copy, while in cases where all of the candidate tes have highly similar sequences, their score will be uniformly low.figure  <dig> 
illustration of the donor-scoring algorithm. in this example we describe an event involving a te copy that differs by only one base pair from another te in the same family. because multiple mappings are considered, most of the discordant reads anchored around the insertion locus will map on both candidate donors equally well , which will result in te-tracker reporting both of them. however a fraction of the discordant reads  will span the one divergent position that differentiates both copies. these reads will map on both locations as well, but their mapping quality score will be significantly higher on the true donor copy. counting such reads for each donor allows te-tracker to quickly determine a “specificity score” for each candidate, therefore helping to determinate the probable true origin of the transposition event. for simplicity, only the multiple mappings of discordant pairs were represented on this figure.



comparison with other software
we compared te-tracker with retroseq  <cit> , a popular program that detects novel mobilization among known te families, as well as delly  <cit> , hydra  <cit> , variationhunter-commonlaw  <cit>  and gasvpro  <cit> , which are general-purpose structural variant detection tools that can be applied to the detection of te insertions. we were not able to test other te-dedicated software in a meaningful way, since only retroseq is generic enough to allow comparison. indeed, it is not limited to tes that exhibit a tsd, is not genome specific, and provides information about the family of the donor element. a comparison of the features, algorithms and input formats of all these programs is given in table  <dig> table  <dig>

this table illustrates a major pitfall when comparing sv detection programs, namely the variety of input file formats and level of output information. all sv detection programs will produce breakpoints, that is, clusters of reads that map anomalously on the reference genome sequence; it is the user’s task to determine which of these clusters  can indicate a transposition event, and if it does, which of those correspond to the real donor sequence. on the other hand, retroseq is able to produce the insertion locus and, using prior annotation, the te family involved; te-tracker will also produce a source-destination type output, but in addition it will attribute a score to potential multiple donors in an attempt to produce an unambiguous transposition signature. moreover, te-tracker and the majority of other programs accept the versatile bam alignment files, whereas variationhunter requires a particular alignment format. programs also differ in terms of the quantity of work they perform : hydra requires pre-filtering of discordant paired reads, most other programs only output breakpoints , whereas te-tracker is able to do the filtering, detection and insertion calling on its own. given this heterogeneity in the way these methods are used, we chose to harmonize the results providing equal ground for comparison . finally, some programs are designed for a given sequencing protocol, e.g. short or long fragments, even if they can deal with both types of input data. in these cases, we chose to report only the results obtained from the sequencing protocol that led to the best metrics .table  <dig>

 paired-end  reads were generated using art and mate-pair  reads were generated using simseqg. if programs can deal with both types of input data, we chose to report only the results obtained from the sequencing protocol that led to the best metrics.

a transposition event is qualified as « found » when at least one line in the output file has either one or the other side of a cluster overlapping the insertion site ; a transposition event is qualified as « found with donor » when at least one line in the output file spans both the origin and destination sequence . even when the correct donor is identified for an insertion locus, other possible donors are often reported due to sequence similarity. for te-tracker, we display the number of cases where the donor-scoring feature distinguishes the real donor from all reported ones in parentheses. this feature is unique to te-tracker. the best detection statistic is displayed in bold in relevant rows.



in order to evaluate these programs with respect to the detection of de-novo te insertions, we simulated  <dig> transposition events in the tair <dig> arabidopsis thaliana reference sequence. these transposition events were classified into four subgroups : « normal » insertions correspond to events that arise from the mobilization of the full length of an annotated te ; « composite » insertions correspond to events that mobilize a series of contiguous tes, « long » insertions simulate the mobilization of a te along with a certain amount of flanking sequence, and finally, « short » insertions correspond to the mobilization of a fraction of a sequence annotated as a te . then, we generated paired reads with a sequencing simulator. we produced the type of reads that were most suited for each program; for long-fragment paired-end reads we used the in-house simseqg simulator , whereas art  <cit>  was chosen for short fragment paired-end reads. simulated reads were then aligned onto the arabidopsis reference genome sequence.

results of the test runs are summarized in table  <dig>  overall, they suggest that programs designed specifically for the detection of te mobilization behave very differently from tools that were designed for a broader sv detection purpose. indeed, retroseq, the only program in the first category, exhibits a high ppv , which translates into a significantly lower number of false positives compared to programs in the second category. however, its sensitivity is also lower, with under half  of the simulated insertions successfully detected. programs in the second category perform better in that regard  but have a lower ppv. this discrepancy is a direct consequence of how each type of algorithm works: retroseq specifically looks for discordant pairs anchored in regions annotated as te sequences, while the others scan the entire read space.

te-tracker stands between these two classes of programs, since, although it does not start from regions annotated as te sequences, achieves a ppv  that is slightly better than retroseq . the number of true insertions found is also 78% higher with te-tracker compared to retroseq and is similar to the ones reported by delly and gasvpro, highlighting the benefit of an annotation-independent, de novo approach. this is further demonstrated by the results in table  <dig> in which we show the breakdown of the results according to the type of transposition event generated. as expected, retroseq is able to detect normal and short insertions, but performs very poorly for long and composite insertions. this suggests that retroseq is unable to detect mobilization events for which the te is in fact longer than its existing annotation, or events that involve a sequence containing the annotation of two distinct tes. te-tracker on the other hand exhibits similar performance over all four types of insertions, making it able to detect novel te mobilization even in cases where pre-existing annotation is either absent, incomplete or uncertain as can be the case with complex repeated sequences such as tes.table  <dig>

finally, in order to test the performance of our donor-scoring feature in the presence of a large number of potential donors, we performed similar tests on the human genome. we selected two human chromosomes, on which we simulated the mobilization of two, 6 kb-long l1-type elements that differ by  <dig> nucleotides and that have been described as active in the human brain  <cit> . in total, there are about one hundred distinct, potentially mobile full length l <dig> on these two chromosomes. of the  <dig> random insertions generated ,  <dig> were detected , the three remaining ones were not detectable as they were found to have been inserted in sequence gaps. furthermore, only one l <dig> donor was misattributed in this set, indicating that te-tracker’s donor scoring algorithm performs well even in the presence of multiple close homologs of the real donor sequence. since te-tracker analyses only one pair of chromosomes at a time, the performance observed in this test can be assumed to scale to a whole-genome study.

application of te-tracker to the exploration of the transposition landscape in arabidopsis
we applied te-tracker to the identification of novel te insertions in a set of four arabidopsis epirils derived from a cross between a wild type  plant and a mutant plant for the gene decrease in dna methylation  <dig>   <cit> . dna methylation as well as transcriptional silencing of tes is severely compromised in ddm <dig> mutant plants  <cit> , thus potentially leading to te re-mobilization  <cit> . the four epirils together with one wt line were sequenced using illumina mate-pair libraries , in order to enable the detection of new insertions for almost all of the tes that are potentially active in the genome, as over 90% of all full-length annotated arabidopsis tes are less than 11 kb long  <cit> . effective mean sequencing coverage  ranged from 11x to 25x . results are illustrated in figure  <dig> and summarized in additional file 3: table s <dig>  additional file 4: table s <dig>  additional file 5: table s <dig>  additional file 6: table s <dig>  additional file 7: table s <dig>  partial results obtained for several other epirils and using a beta version of te-tracker were reported elsewhere  <cit> . for the four epirils analyzed here, te-tracker could detect a total of  <dig> distinct insertions that match annotated te sequences . the vast majority  of these insertions were not detected in the wt parental line, as expected if most transposition events occurred in the ddm <dig> parental line or during the propagation of the epirils . to validate these results, a random set of  <dig> potentially novel insertions as well as one insertion also shared with the wt parent were tested by pcr. in all  <dig> cases, the presence of the insertion could be confirmed , which provides further evidence of the high specificity of te-tracker. furthermore, sequencing of  <dig> pcr products corresponding to new insertions was used to evaluate the performance of te-tracker in identifying donor tes. in all but one case, the donor-scoring module was able to identify the correct te donor sequence. also, sequencing of both ends of  <dig> new insertions confirmed the presence of a target site duplication in each case, as expected for true transposition events . among these, we validated several insertions involving composite sequences that were not previously annotated as full-length te units . these results confirm that te-tracker is able to detect transposition events involving sequences not explicitly annotated as a single te, which is currently impossible with annotation-based methods such as retroseq  <cit> .table  <dig>

of the  <dig> distinct novel te insertions identified, six were shared among the four epirils . this proportion is significantly lower than that expected  if all insertions had occurred in the ddm <dig> parental line used to establish the epiril population  <cit> , which indicates that te mobilization likely occurs in subsequent generations in most cases. furthermore, transposition in the epirils concerns only a small number of te families , which is consistent with a previous report of te mobilization in ddm <dig>  <cit> . these findings, together with the fact that most te sequences are transcriptionally reactivated in ddm <dig>  <cit> , suggest therefore an important role of posttranscriptional mechanisms in preventing te mobilization in arabidopsis. our analysis indicates in addition that mobilization, when it occurs, often concerns only one of the potentially mobile te members of a given family. for instance, despite there being two highly similar copies of the ltr retroelement family atcopia <dig>  only one is detected as mobile by te-tracker in the genome of the columbia accession, as was previously reported  <cit> . however, there are exceptions to this rule, as exemplified by the fact that several members of the ltr retroelement family atcopia <dig>  which is closely related to atcopia <dig>  have been mobilized. as many of these new atcopia <dig> insertions are shared among at least two of the epirils, transposition is likely to have taken place in most cases in the parental ddm <dig> line or in the f <dig>  which contradicts a previous claim that atcopia <dig> cannot transpose in this mutant background  <cit> . furthermore, in the case of atcopia <dig> insertions, the donor-scoring feature often yielded two potential donors with similar high scores. detailed analysis of the reads supporting one such atcopia <dig> insertion showed the existence of distinct sequential blocks corresponding to either donor. this is in agreement with previous reports indicating that similarly to what is seen in viruses  <cit> , two rna intermediates matching distinct ltr-te family members could be encapsidated together. as a result, te sequences could undergo recombination by template switching during cdna synthesis  <cit> , thus leading to the insertion of a chimeric sequence presenting block-wise similarity to both of the parent elements . incidentally, the validated atcopia <dig> insertion that is also present in the wt line may in fact reflect mis-assembly of the reference genome sequence, as this insertion maps within a truncated copy of atcopia <dig>  whether the other seven te insertions shared with the wt line also represent cases of genome sequence mis-assembly remains to be determined.

close examination of te-tracker’s output revealed in addition that the dna transposon vandal <dig> tends to insert preferentially close to the transcription start site of genes and in the same orientation as these . this result suggests that transcription initiation of the target locus is involved in the insertion of vandal <dig> elements. five of these vandal <dig> insertions were tested using pcr and subsequently validated .

we also note that overall, new te insertions are spread across the entire genome , which contrasts with the pericentromeric localization of most te sequences present in the arabidopsis genome. this suggests that purifying selection plays an important role in eliminating insertions that occur within the gene-rich regions of arabidopsis chromosomes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a program, te-tracker, which accurately detects both the source and destination of novel transposition events in re-sequenced genomes. since te-tracker only relies on the detection and clustering of discordant paired reads and not on te annotation, it is generic and enables to track any mobilized te, irrespective of its identity. moreover, te-tracker is able to detect all potential donor sequences for a given insertion, and by discriminating reads that map better to a particular donor, it can attribute the correct one among them if they differ by at least one nucleotide. furthermore, te-tracker produces significantly less noise than common sv detection programs, therefore allowing the researcher to focus exclusively and exhaustively on te mobilization events in a re-sequenced genome. we have applied te-tracker to provide a comprehensive view of transposition events induced by loss of dna methylation in arabidopsis.
