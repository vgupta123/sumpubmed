BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is often associated with nosocomial infections, which can lead to life threatening conditions such as acute endocarditis and bacteremia. pathogenesis by s. aureus involves several bacterial virulence factors including exotoxins and adhesins 
 <cit> . six different adhesins of s. aureus  were found to bind to the extracellular matrix  protein fibronectin 
 <cit> . in particular, bacterial cell wall anchored fibronectin binding proteins  can capture soluble fibronectin from host plasma 
 <cit> . binding to fibronectin is mediated by several repeats within fnbp, which interact with the amino-terminal fibronectin type i domains of this host glycoprotein 
 <cit> . via an rgd motif within one of the fibronectin type iii domains, s. aureus-associated fibronectin is able to bind with high affinity to integrin α5β <dig>  accordingly, fibronectin can serve as a molecular bridge connecting s. aureus with host cell receptors 
 <cit> . moreover, the fnbp-fibronectin mediated engagement of integrins triggers internalization of the microbes by non-professional phagocytes such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts 
 <cit> . several investigations demonstrate the importance of the fnbp-mediated invasion process in vivo. in a rat model of endocarditis, s. aureus strains with reduced fibronectin-binding capacity showed a decreased ability to colonize damaged heart valves 
 <cit> . in addition, fnbp expression enhances the capacity of s. aureus to colonize mammary glands and invade mammary epithelial cells in a mouse model of mastitis 
 <cit> . exogenous expression of s. aureus fnbp in non-pathogenic lactobacillus lactis allows these bacteria to colonize damaged heart valves and to spread to the spleen in a mouse model of endocarditis 
 <cit> . therefore, fnbp-mediated host cell contact and cellular invasion appear to contribute to s. aureus survival and persistence within the infected host 
 <cit> . as fnbp-related proteins are found in other human pathogens and as integrin-mediated host cell internalization appears critical for certain manifestations of s. aureus infections, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding fnbp-initiated uptake is warranted.

we and others have previously shown that fibronectin deposition on the surface of s. aureus allows engagement of α5β <dig> integrins and triggers the recruitment of actin- and focal adhesion-associated proteins such as paxillin, zyxin, tensin, cortactin, n-wasp, arp2/ <dig>  and fak to the sites of bacterial attachment 
 <cit> . for several of these proteins, including n-wasp, tensin, fak and cortactin, a functional role during integrin-mediated uptake of s. aureus has been demonstrated 
 <cit> . as reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for the internalization process 
 <cit> , it is assumed that dynamic regulation of f-actin by these proteins contributes to bacterial uptake.

vinculin is one of the characteristic actin-binding proteins recruited to integrin-rich focal adhesion sites, which mechanically links integrin cytoplasmic tails with the actin cytoskeleton 
 <cit> . vinculin has no enzymatic activity and its functions are regulated by a conformational switch between a closed  conformation, mediated by an intramolecular head-tail interaction, and an open  state 
 <cit> . in the open conformation, the vinculin head and tail domains dissociate, allowing multiple interactions with additional proteins or phospholipids 
 <cit> . for example, talin, α-actinin, vasp, paxillin, phosphatidylinositol- <dig> -bisphosphate, and f-actin bind to active vinculin 
 <cit> . in addition, vinculin may promote actin filament nucleation by recruiting the arp2/ <dig> complex to integrin tails 
 <cit> . furthermore, depending on the conformational state, vinculin can also act as an f-actin barbed end capping protein 
 <cit> . a role for vinculin during bacterial entry has been reported in the case of shigella flexneri. upon contact with epithelial cells, s. flexneri injects the ipaa protein into the host cell cytoplasm, where ipaa directly binds to vinculin inducing a dramatic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton to promote bacterial engulfment 
 <cit> . vinculin has also been observed to be recruited to s. aureus–host cell contact sites or fibronectin-coated beads in epithelial, but not in endothelial cells 
 <cit> . however, it has not been investigated if vinculin has a functional role during integrin-mediated internalization of s. aureus into host cells.

in this report, we analyze the contribution of vinculin to fnbp-mediated uptake of s. aureus in different human and murine cell types. surprisingly, re-expression of vinculin in vinculin-deficient fibroblasts as well as shrna-mediated knock-down of this protein in different cell types do not affect bacterial uptake demonstrating that vinculin is completely dispensable for bacterial internalization via integrin α5β <dig>  therefore, our results suggest that actin cytoskeleton rearrangements during integrin-mediated endocytosis do not require vinculin function despite the well characterized role of vinculin as a linker between integrins and f-actin.

RESULTS
enhanced cell invasion of s. aureus into vinculin knock-out fibroblasts correlates with increased integrin α <dig> surface expression
murine embryonic fibroblasts with a genetic deletion of vinculin  have been generated and been used in a previous study 
 <cit> . when grown on a fibronectin-coated surface, vinculin -/- cells spread more slowly and form smaller, less stable focal adhesions compared to wildtype fibroblasts  or vinculin -/- cells re-expressing vinculin 
 <cit> . total internal reflection fluorescence  microscopy demonstrates that vinculin is located in well-organized, peripheral focal adhesions in vinculin wt cells. in vinculin -/- cells, no staining with the monoclonal α-vinculin antibody was observed . the absence of vinculin was accompanied by a reduced size and an altered distribution of integrin β1-containing focal adhesions at the cell-substrate interface . compared to vinculin -/- cells, vinculin wt cells showed concentration of large integrin β1-containing focal adhesions in the cell periphery . however, the overall amount of active integrin β <dig> did not differ between vinculin wt and vinculin -/- cells as detected by a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody . the lack of vinculin in whole cell lysates  prepared from vinculin -/- cells was also confirmed by western blotting . importantly, expression of several known focal adhesion proteins and vinculin binding partners such as talin, fak, paxillin, and src was not altered by the absence of vinculin . equal loading of cell lysates for western blotting was confirmed by probing for β-tubulin . to test for a functional role of vinculin in the integrin-mediated internalization of bacteria, we infected these fibroblasts with pathogenic s. aureus strain cowan, which connects to the host cell receptor integrin α5β <dig> by binding to the integrin ligand fibronectin. as a negative control, we used non-pathogenic s. carnosus, which lacks a fibronectin binding adhesin and which does not invade host cells 
 <cit> . as expected, host cell adhesion and invasion assays confirmed that s. carnosus was unable to invade fibroblasts, whereas s. aureus attached to and invaded vinculin wt cells . unexpectedly, vinculin -/- cells showed significantly increased numbers of cell-associated s. aureus  and about 40% increase in host cell invasion . as vinculin -/- cells have undergone several rounds of selection during their establishment 
 <cit> , compensatory mechanisms might have occurred in the absence of vinculin. in particular, vinculin -/- cells supported increased cell-association of s. aureus , suggesting that the availability of the involved host cell receptor, integrin α5β <dig>  might be altered in these cells. therefore, expression of different integrin subunits on the surface of vinculin wt and vinculin -/- cells were investigated by flow cytometry. whereas integrin β <dig> was present in similar amounts in both cell lines, a strongly increased surface expression of integrin α <dig> and a reduced expression of the integrin αv subunit was detected in vinculin -/- cells . elevated amounts of integrin α <dig> transcripts were also detected in vinculin -/- cells by quantitative real-time pcr . the altered integrin α <dig> expression in vinculin -/- cells correlated with the enhanced host cell binding of s. aureus. together, these results suggested that the altered integrin expression profile of vinculin wt compared to vinculin -/- cells, and not the absence of vinculin, might be responsible for the observed differences in host cell invasion by s. aureus in these murine fibroblast lines.

re-expression of vinculin in vinculin -/- fibroblasts does not affect bacterial entry
to address the contribution of vinculin for host cell invasion of s. aureus in an identical cellular context, we transiently transfected vinculin -/- cells with a construct encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein -tagged murine vinculin. as a control, an gfp encoding vector was used.  <dig> h post-transfection, cells seeded on gelatine-coated coverslips were infected with s. aureus  for  <dig> h, fixed and, after blocking with 10% fetal calf serum in pbs, extracellular bacteria were stained by rabbit α-staphylococcal serum and goat α-rabbit antibody coupled to cy <dig>  after cell permeabilization, total cell-associated bacteria were stained by applying rabbit α-staphylococcal serum and cy3-coupled goat α-rabbit antibody. the double cycle antibody staining according to this established protocol enables the discrimination between intracellular and extracellular bacteria 
 <cit> . fluorescence microscopy pictures revealed that a fraction of gfp-vinculin, but not gfp, localized at focal adhesion sites in the transiently transfected vinculin -/- cells . moreover, vinculin re-expression was accompanied by a morphological change to a more spread phenotype . nevertheless, both gfp as well as gfp-vinculin expressing cells harbored intracellular bacteria . enumeration of cell-associated extracellular or intracellular bacteria in gfp versus gfp-vinculin transfected cells demonstrated that bacterial binding and uptake into these cells occurred at a similar level . thus, the transient re-expression of vinculin in vinculin -/- cells changes the spreading of the cells, without altering bacterial uptake, indicating that vinculin may not contribute to the internalization of s. aureus.

vinculin overexpression does not influence the uptake of s. aureus in human cells
our results that vinculin might not be necessary for integrin-mediated uptake by murine cells were surprising, given by the fact that vinculin is recruited to the sites of bacterial entry in human cells and has a role in f-actin organization and focal adhesion turnover 
 <cit> . to analyze weather vinculin is functionally involved in s. aureus invasion into human cells, we transiently transfected 293t cells to express gfp or gfp-vinculin, respectively. western blotting with vinculin antibodies confirmed that total vinculin levels were augmented ~10-fold following transfection with gfp-vinculin  compared to the endogenous levels of vinculin  in the gfp transfected cells . equal loading of proteins from both samples was confirmed by probing for β-tubulin . expression levels of integrin α <dig> were only slightly increased in response to vinculin overexpression . transfected cells were also seeded on gelatine-coated wells and infected at moi  <dig> for  <dig> h with the fnbp-expressing s. aureus or the non-invasive s. carnosus. total cell-associated bacteria as well as the numbers of viable intracellular bacteria were then determined. in agreement with our previous observations, the amounts of total cell-associated , as well as the viable intracellular bacteria were unaltered by vinculin overexpression . these results demonstrate that vinculin overexpression does not modulate s. aureus entry into human cells. these data also indicate that vinculin is not a limiting factor for the integrin-mediated uptake of these fibronectin-binding bacteria and further suggest that the differences observed between murine vinculin wt and vinculin -/- cells might be due to alterations in the expression pattern of integrin subunits.

shrna-mediated vinculin silencing does not interfere with s. aureus internalization
though vinculin is not limiting for s. aureus uptake, endogenous levels of this protein might still be needed to support internalization. therefore, we investigated whether shrna-mediated knock-down of vinculin might interfere with s. aureus uptake. to this end, we generated murine fibroblasts stably transduced with recombinant lentiviral particles harboring the empty plasmid plko. <dig> or the plasmid plko. <dig> encoding shrna against murine vinculin . after puromycin selection, the successful vinculin knock-down in the transduced cell population was verified by western blotting. importantly, complete inhibition of mouse vinculin expression, but unaltered expression of fak, src or paxillin was detected . furthermore, surface levels of integrin α <dig> were similar in vinculin-deficient and vinculin-expressing fibroblasts . next, we were interested if the vinculin knock-down could affect interaction of the bacteria with host cells with regard to cell attachment and internalization. accordingly, plko. <dig> and plko. <dig> sh-mvinc fibroblasts were infected with s. aureus and the amount of total cell-associated as well as the number of viable intracellular bacteria was determined . though the amounts of cell-associated bacteria were decreased in plko. <dig> sh-mvinc fibroblasts compared to control cells, the number of intracellular bacteria in both cell populations was equal. the results from the bacterial adhesion assay correlated with the slightly decreased expression of integrin α <dig> on the surface of vinculin knock-down cells, compared to control cells .

in a second parallel approach, we generated  <dig> cells stably transduced with recombinant lentiviral particles harboring the empty plasmid plko. <dig> or with particles harboring plasmid plko. <dig> encoding shrna against human vinculin . after puromycin selection, plko. <dig> sh-hvinc cells showed no detectable vinculin expression in whole cell lysates, but no alteration in fak, src and paxillin expression . functional assays of bacterial interaction with host cells revealed that knock-down of vinculin in these human cells again did not influence their ability to support fibronectin-mediated cell attachment or internalization of s. aureus .

taken together, our results demonstrate that vinculin is not required for s. aureus invasion in different cell types. although vinculin might be recruited to the site of bacterial attachment, it has no functional role in orchestrating the integrin-mediated internalization of staphylococci into the eukaryotic host cells.

discussion
since its discovery  <dig> years ago, vinculin has emerged as a key structural adaptor molecule dynamically linking integrins with the actin cytoskeleton 
 <cit> . here we present experimental evidence that vinculin, despite its reported recruitment, is not required for the integrin-mediated internalization of staphylococcus aureus by mammalian cells. our conclusions are based on genetic deletion of vinculin and the complementation of the resulting vinculin-deficient cells, shrna-mediated knock-down of vinculin, and overexpression of vinculin in different cell types, as all these different treatments do not affect host cell invasion by fibronectin-binding s. aureus.

initially, we were puzzled by the finding that vinculin-deficient murine fibroblasts showed slightly elevated association with and uptake of fibronectin-binding s. aureus. however, the immortalized vinculin-deficient embryonic fibroblasts exhibited increased expression of integrin α <dig> compared to wildtype fibroblasts. it is currently unclear, if the altered expression of integrin α <dig> is directly caused by the lack of vinculin, which has been reported to associate with factors involved in mrna splicing 
 <cit> , or if this alteration might be due to prolonged in vitro selection and culture of the vinculin-deficient cells. clearly, re-expression of vinculin in the vinculin-deficient cells did not alter integrin α <dig> expression and shrna-mediated knock-down of vinculin in different cell types did not lead to an increase in integrin α <dig>  therefore, diminishing or increasing vinculin levels in different cell types did neither affect integrin α <dig> nor integrin-mediated uptake of s. aureus suggesting that changes observed in the vinculin -/- cells might have a secondary cause.

interestingly, vinculin is involved in cell entry of several bacterial pathogens including shigella flexneri and bartonella henselae. for example, sirna screening has revealed that vinculin and other integrin-associated molecules are critical for the formation of the characteristic invasome structure, which mediates entry of the zoonotic pathogen b. henselae  into endothelial cells 
 <cit> .

in the case of s. flexneri, a leading cause of dysentery worldwide, the entry into human epithelial cells is dramatically impaired in the absence of vinculin 
 <cit> . upon encounter of host cells, s. flexneri injects the ipaa protein. this effector protein contains three vinculin binding sites , which recognize the n-terminal vinculin head domain 
 <cit> . therefore, a single ipaa protein may bind up to three vinculin molecules. importantly, deletion of ipaa or disruption of all three vbs in ipaa severely impair shigella uptake demonstrating the critical role of vinculin in this entry pathway 
 <cit> . interestingly, the vbs of ipaa are reminiscent of the vinculin binding sites found in the carboxy-terminal rod domain of the focal adhesion protein talin 
 <cit> . the eleven vbs of talin also engage the vinculin head domain and help to relief the intramolecular interactions in vinculin 
 <cit> . accordingly, talin or ipaa binding to the vinculin head domain result in exposure of the vinculin tail domain with its binding sites for several proteins including f-actin, α-actinin, or the arp2/ <dig> complex 
 <cit> . how vinculin in its active conformation promotes shigella entry is not completely understood, but it has been shown that a vinculin-binding ipaa peptide can modulate the barbed end capping of actin filaments and thereby controls the rate of f-actin polymerization 
 <cit> . similarly, conformational changes in vinculin induced by ipaa may also expose the binding site for the arp2/ <dig> complex, which is located in a linker region between the vinculin head and tail domain 
 <cit> . again, this would allow shigella to trigger actin polymerization required for efficient bacterial internalization.

a further hint, that vinculin can regulate actin polymerization during bacterial entry comes from the study of helicobacter pylori, an extracellular pathogen, which can engage integrins without being internalized 
 <cit> . h. pylori translocates the type iv secretion system effector protein caga into gastric epithelial cells 
 <cit> . bacterial caga is initially tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently inhibits the catalytic activity of src family protein tyrosine kinases 
 <cit> . the lack of src activity results in severely reduced phosphorylation of vinculin on residues y <dig> and y <dig>  disrupting interactions between vinculin and the arp2/ <dig> complex, and blocking actin cytoskeleton rearrangements in epithelial cells 
 <cit> . together these results suggest that vinculin is a central host factor targeted by several bacterial effector proteins to orchestrate actin cytoskeleton rearrangements to the advantage of the pathogens.

as actin cytoskeleton dynamics are also essential for s. aureus host cell entry, yet vinculin does not seem to participate functionally in this process, regulation of actin dynamics might be achieved in a different manner during uptake of fibronectin-binding staphylococci. previous results indicate that fibronectin-dependent, integrin-mediated internalization of s. aureus into host cells requires the integrin-associated tyrosine kinases src and fak 
 <cit> . one downstream substrate of the active fak/src complex is cortactin 
 <cit> . indeed, cortactin is strongly tyrosine phosphorylated upon contact of fibronectin-binding s. aureus with host cells and depletion of cortactin reduces s. aureus invasion 
 <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated cortactin directly associates with fak via sh <dig> domain-mediated binding to proline-rich sequences in fak 
 <cit> . as cortactin is also able to organize the f-actin cytoskeleton and to stimulate the actin polymerizing arp2/ <dig> complex 
 <cit> , recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin might direct the cytoskeletal rearrangements during s. aureus internalization, superseding vinculin function downstream of integrin engagement.

taken together, our investigations come to the surprising conclusion that vinculin is not required for the integrin-mediated uptake of s. aureus into host cells. despite the documented role of vinculin in dynamically linking integrins with the actin cytoskeleton, our results suggest that other cellular factors, such as the fak-src-cortactin signaling axis, are critical for triggering actin remodeling and bacterial entry during integrin endocytosis. it also appears likely that uptake of other pathogens, which engage integrins for host cell invasion, might be also independent of vinculin function.

CONCLUSIONS
