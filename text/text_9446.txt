BACKGROUND
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy  is an autosomal dominant disease with a prevalence of 1: <dig>   <cit>  that is characterized by weakness and atrophy of the muscles of the face, upper arms and shoulder girdle. the fshd locus has been mapped by linkage analysis to the subtelomeric region of the long arm of chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . the disorder is associated with the deletion of an integral number of tandemly arrayed  <dig> -kb units   <cit> . each d4z <dig> repeat contains two homeoboxes within a single predicted open reading frame , double homeobox chromosome  <dig> . the number of repeats varies from  <dig> to  <dig> in normal subjects, but is consistently less than  <dig> in fshd patients  <cit> , a contraction that is predominantly associated with a specific variant of chromosome  <dig> called 4qa  <cit> . only a few patients with phenotypic fshd show normal-sized d4z <dig> repeats on both chromosomes  <dig>  it is interesting to note that the d4z <dig> repeats in patients with d4z <dig> contractions or phenotypic fshd show reduced levels of dna methylation. d4z <dig> hypomethylation is more prominent and present on both chromosomes  <dig> in patients with phenotypic fshd, but it is restricted to the diseased chromosome in those with 4q-linked fshd  <cit> .

the region immediately proximal to the d4z <dig> repeats harbors a number of candidate genes. this fshd locus includes fshd-related gene  <dig>   <cit> , which encodes a nucleolar protein involved in rna biogenesis  <cit> ; tubb4q, a member of the Î²-tubulin family; and frg <dig>  a predicted transcript with no significant homology to any known protein. the adenine nucleotide transporter  <dig> gene , a gene involved in apoptosis, lies more distally from the 4qter   <cit> .

in addition to the dux <dig> orf within each unit of the tandem array, there is a dux4-like sequence  near frg <dig>  preliminary data suggest that dux4c may be expressed in fshd samples  <cit> , and it has been shown that its ectopic overexpression interferes with myogenic regulators and abolishes myoblast differentiation  <cit> . the expression of dux <dig> rna and protein has recently been selectively detected in primary myoblasts from fshd patients, thus suggesting its involvement in fshd  <cit> . furthermore, the overexpression of dux <dig> in different cell lines induces cell toxicity and apoptosis  <cit> . the overexpression of frg <dig>  frg <dig>  and ant <dig> has been found in some muscles affected by fshd  <cit> . it has also been shown that a transcriptional repressor complex binds d4z <dig>  and it is thought that d4z <dig> deletion would trigger gene overexpression as a result of the lack of repression  <cit> ; the overexpression of frg <dig>  but not ant <dig> and frg <dig>  in transgenic mice leads to a general muscle dystrophy  <cit> . furthermore, frg <dig> overexpression in fshd samples is not a uniform finding,  <cit>  and thus the contribution of the frg <dig> gene to the fshd phenotype needs further validation. the transcriptional alterations reported above in some of the genes of the fshd locus may be caused by a perturbation of the chromatin structure driven by the deletion of d4z <dig> units  <cit> .

this paper describes the crosstalking molecular events that occur within the fshd locus. we concentrated on frg <dig> because, although it is indicated as a candidate gene for fshd pathogenesis, the molecular link between d4z <dig> deletion and frg <dig> deregulation remains unclear. we found that frg <dig> is upregulated during myogenic differentiation and that fshd myoblasts show significantly premature frg <dig> expression in the early stages of differentiation. we investigated the chromatin features of frg <dig> at hierarchical levels during myogenic differentiation in myoblasts derived from fshd patients and normal individuals, and found that the frg <dig> promoter undergoes chromatin remodeling involving the loss of the polycomb repressor complex. parallel analysis of d4z <dig> repeats showed that the chromatin is marked by h3k27me <dig>  and the polycomb complex, and that both repressive markers are lost in myotubes. we further demonstrated that the physical interaction of the non-contiguous frg <dig> and d4z <dig> array, which is loosened in fshd myoblasts, is remodeled upon cell differentiation. these results provide a connection between the deletion of d4z <dig> repeats and the misregulation of the frg <dig> candidate gene in fshd cells.

RESULTS
frg <dig> expression is upregulated during the myogenic differentiation of human myoblasts
we investigated the mechanisms that regulate frg <dig> gene transcription during the myogenic differentiation of human primary myoblasts. all experiments were performed using three myoblast cell lines derived from healthy donors, and four cell lines derived from fshd patients .

we first monitored myotube formation by means of immunostaining with sarcomeric myosin and myod antibodies after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days of myogenic differentiation , and analyzed the expression of skeletal muscle-specific markers in myoblasts and myotubes after  <dig> days of differentiation  analysis of myogenin, myod and myosin in additional file 1c). the percentage formation was calculated as the number of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole -positive nuclei in myotubes  divided by the total number of nuclei in the area, and the obtained fusion index ranged from 60% to 90% .

the expression of sarcomeric myosin during myogenic differentiation  was checked by means of real time rt-pcr , and the results indicated that both the control and fshd muscle cells were undergoing correct myogenic differentiation and had comparable differentiation properties.

these experimental conditions were used to analyze frg <dig> expression at transcriptional and protein levels by rt-pcr and western blotting. frg <dig> mrna and protein expression was higher in the myotubes than in the myoblasts ; these data were confirmed in all the available cell lines . rt-pcr analysis of a panel of adult human tissue rna showed that frg <dig> expression was not restricted to muscle cells . frg <dig> therefore seems to be subject to muscle-specific regulation, but is not a classic muscle gene.

we then analyzed frg <dig> myogenic regulation at the histone code level using chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments, and found that the h3k <dig> trimethylation  repression marker  on the frg <dig> promoter in myoblasts was replaced by the h3k4me <dig> activation marker in myotubes . h3k4me <dig> was also present on the frg <dig> promoter in other human non-muscle cells expressing frg <dig>  <cit> , such as hela and lymphoblasts . these findings suggest that the very low frg <dig> mrna level observed in myoblasts is caused by active repression, based at least on the trimethylation of h3k <dig>  whereas h3k4me <dig> is a hallmark of gene activation. the switch between h3k27me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> was monitored in all of the available myoblasts and myotubes, and found to be statistically significant in both controls and patients .

it has been previously shown that several muscle-specific genes in myoblasts are silenced as a result of the promoter recruitment of the histone h3k <dig> methyltransferase  ezh <dig> via yy <dig>  two key components of the polycomb complex  <cit> , and that changes in h3k <dig> and yy <dig> binding can be associated with dna methylation  <cit> . upon gene activation, yy <dig> and ezh <dig> dissociate from their target promoters, h3k <dig> becomes hypomethylated, and myod and serum response factor  are recruited  <cit> . we analyzed the frg <dig> promoter sequence using matinspector software  and identified one carg box  at position - <dig> from the transcriptional start site , and two flanking e-boxes  at positions - <dig> and - <dig> . for these analyses, as the frg <dig> genomic region is duplicated in the human genome  <cit> , we designed primer pairs specifically aimed at the 4q frg <dig> genomic copy and confirmed their selectivity by means of a panel of human somatic cell monohybrids . we performed chip experiments on myoblasts and myotubes using antibodies against h3k27me <dig>  yy <dig>  ezh <dig> targeting the frg <dig> yy <dig> regulatory region  and the proximal promoter  as a control  . in myoblasts, yy <dig> and ezh <dig> were detected on carg box , and h3k27me <dig> widely marked the frg <dig> promoter  .

we also carried out a methylated dna immunoprecipitation  assay of the same frg <dig> promoter regions  to analyze the dna methylation status of the promoter, and mapped a region of dna methylation in correspondence with the yy <dig> binding site . after  <dig> days of differentiation, polycomb complex binding and the h3k27me <dig> marker were lost ; however, there was no change in the dna methylation pattern of the promoter, as has been previously reported in the case of other muscle genes  <cit> . additional file 4a shows examples of the chip and medip analyses of the frg <dig> promoter.

these results indicate that frg <dig> gene expression is regulated during human myogenic differentiation, and that the gene behaves in the same way as other muscle fiber-specific genes  <cit> .

the frg <dig> gene is prematurely expressed at early stages of fshd myoblast differentiation
the finding of frg <dig> upregulation in muscle biopsies of fshd patients is controversial  <cit> , and previous studies have failed to detect any significant difference of frg <dig> expression levels in fshd myoblasts  <cit> . we therefore compared the pattern of frg <dig> mrna expression during differentiation in fshd and control cells.

frg <dig> expression was analyzed in three fshd and three control muscle biopsies by means of real time rt-pcr using primer pairs that exclusively amplified the 4q frg <dig> copy  <cit> . in agreement with previous studies, we observed that frg <dig> overexpression in muscle biopsies is not a uniform finding; indeed, only one fshd sample showed frg <dig> upregulation . as frg <dig> showed muscle-specific upregulation , we performed this analysis in primary myoblasts derived from the same muscle biopsies and during their myogenic differentiation of . no frg <dig> overexpression was detected in fshd myoblasts, as these samples did not show any statistical significant difference compared to control cells. indeed, two control samples showed a basal level of frg <dig> expression higher than fshd. moreover, all the samples showed frg <dig> upregulation during myoblasts differentiation . in particular, the comparison of fshd and control cells at each timepoint of differentiation for the increase of frg <dig> mrna level  showed statistically significant results only for fshd samples at day  <dig>  we then derived the overall kinetics of frg <dig> expression during myogenic differentiation of fshd and control cells as median values of frg <dig> expression at each point of differentiation , after the subtraction of the value at day  <dig> . this analysis confirmed that in fshd samples the frg <dig> transcription at day  <dig> is significantly upregulated with respect to controls . we verified that this was not due to a higher rate of differentiation because the myosin levels monitored at the same time were similar in the fshd and control samples . in conclusion, these data suggest that the difference between patients and controls for the frg <dig> expression states in the kinetics of transcription during myogenic differentiation.

chromatin structure and the nuclear topology of d4z <dig> array in fshd and control muscle cells
the same chromatin analyses as those described above were used to examine the d4z <dig> sequences. the matinspector software revealed two carg boxes in specific subregions of the repeat, which are indicated as d4z <dig> binding element  <dig> and dbe <dig> in the schema of figure 3a part i. a yy <dig> binding site has been previously described in the d4z <dig> repeat  <cit>  and, in our schema, it coincides with the carg box within the dbe <dig> region .

we then performed chip experiments on three  <dig>  kb subregions of the d4z <dig> unit  . the results obtained for dbe <dig> and lsau are summarized in figure 3a part ii; the results for dbe <dig>  were the same as those obtained for dbe <dig>  in myoblasts, the yy <dig> and ezh <dig> polycomb factors and h3k27me <dig> were associated with the carg box-containing sequences , but not with lsau; in myotubes, the polycomb factors were no longer present in any of the regions . furthermore, as with the frg <dig> promoter , only yy <dig> binding sites were methylated, regardless of the presence of yy <dig> binding . examples of the chip analyses of the d4z <dig> subregions are shown in figure 3a part iii.

to test the hypothesis that the premature activation of the frg <dig> gene during the differentiation of fshd cells may have been due to a weaker repression mechanism mediated by the contracted d4z <dig> allele, we compared h3k <dig> trimethylation levels in the d4z <dig> repeats in control and fshd myoblasts before and after myogenic differentiation. as shown in figure 3b, the chip experiments did not detect any appreciable differences in the h3k <dig> trimethylation between the healthy controls and fshd cells. because of the extensive duplication of d4z <dig> sequences in the human genome  <cit> , the pcr primers used were not 4q specific , and so the results refer to all of the d4z <dig> sequences in the nucleus. it is therefore possible that a difference in d4z <dig> h3k <dig> methylation between normal and fshd cells  may lead to a variation that is too small to be detected by the chip assay. however, chip experiments using monochromosomal cell hybrids retaining chromosome  <dig> indicate the presence of h3k <dig> trimethylation and yy <dig> on dbe sequences ; moreover, medip dna methylation experiments using monochromosomal cell hybrids retaining chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and acrocentrics show that only the dbe sequences on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> are methylated .

furthermore, myogenic differentiation triggered the chromatin remodeling of the d4z <dig> sequences as a whole and induced a significant reduction in the polycomb signals  . taken together these results suggest that 4q d4z <dig> repeats may be represented in samples immunoprecipitated by h3k27me <dig>  yy <dig> and ezh <dig> antibodies. however, as the primer pairs used amplify dbe sequences from many chromosomes , the obtained chip signals might also derive from genomic localizations of d4z <dig> other than 4q. since chip experiments do not provide direct evidence on the chromatin structure of the 4q d4z <dig> array in myoblasts or on the presence of differences between healthy and fshd cells, we used 3d fluorescence in situ hybridization  as a complementary strategy.

to identify the 4q subtelomere, we used a cocktail of three dna probes: two were bacterial artificial chromosomes  of the fshd locus, one containing d4z <dig> repeats  and one not overlapping located  <dig> kb upstream of the d4z <dig> array  , and the third was a painting for chromosome  <dig> territory . we followed their colocalization in order to analyze the nuclear architecture of the fshd locus  and distinguish the two 4q alleles in the nucleus; one 4q allele in almost all fshd nuclei shows a weaker hybridization signal  <cit> , and this was considered the bona fide contracted allele . we then investigated the nuclear position of the fshd locus identified by the three probes  in fshd and control myoblast nuclei.

the nuclei were stained with an h3k27me3-specific antibody , and  <dig> were scored in both the healthy and fshd myoblasts. colocalization with anti-h3k27me <dig> immunofluorescence  was observed in  <dig> % of the 4q alleles in the healthy cells . in particular, the majority of the non-4q d4z <dig> signals   <cit>  were concentrated in nucleolar subdomains that are known to be h3k27me <dig> negative  <cit> . in contrast, the fshd nuclei showed colocalization with h3k27me <dig> signals in only  <dig> % of the 4q alleles  . the h3k27me <dig> colocalized signals were attributed mainly to the wild-type allele identified by the larger hybridization spot . the observed reduction in the colocalization of h3k27me <dig> signals and contracted alleles may have been due to the fact that the fshd alleles give smaller fish spots, thus preventing us from concluding that the contracted alleles were h3k <dig> hypomethylated; nevertheless, the different size of the spot undoubtedly reflects a different concentration of h3k27me <dig> in that subregion of the fshd nucleus. this experiment, which allows the direct visualization of the tridimensional chromatin structure in vivo, revealed that the majority of d4z <dig> sequences modified by h3k27me <dig> belonged to the array on chromosome 4; moreover, we detected significant differences between the patients and controls that cannot be detected by high resolution pcr-based techniques such as chip. paradoxically, when working with highly repeated dna sequences clustered on several chromosomes, it is essential to use an approach that distinguishes the genomic derivations of the signals in order to be able to monitor differences attributable to a specific chromosomal locus  even with a low-resolution technique.

a specific 4q d4z4-mediated chromatin loop involving the frg <dig> promoter is dynamically regulated during human myoblast differentiation
it has been recently demonstrated that the formation of higher order structures is a powerful mechanism coordinating the expression of distant loci in the genome  <cit> . in order to verify whether the d4z <dig> array and frg <dig> gene physically interact in human myoblasts and myotubes, we investigated this association using chromosome conformation capture  technology  <cit>  , and scanned  <dig> kb spanning the fshd locus using primers flanking pvuii restriction sites . the pvuii restriction enzyme was selected because it cuts in proximity to carg sequences on both frg <dig> and the d4z <dig> unit .

a number of controls are essential for the correct interpretation of 3c data  <cit> . we confirmed that all of the 3c primers amplified artificial 3c products in vitro , and did not amplify undigested and ligated, or digested but not ligated, chromatin . furthermore, all of the 3c products derived from crosslinked and bac templates were sequenced and corresponded to the expected sequences . we selected two baits in the proximity of the two pvuii restriction sites in the d4z <dig> unit: one  detected the pvuii-d4z <dig> fragment containing the carg sequences and discriminated d4z <dig> repeats and the unique copy located between the frg <dig> and frg <dig> genes ; the second  detected the remaining portion of the repeat and also a dux4c pvuii fragment . we also designed two baits specific for dux4c pvuii fragments . a total of  <dig> preys  were positioned flanking the pvuii sites in the frg <dig> genomic region , and an additional  <dig> proximal to the d <dig> baits  were used to confirm that interactions between d <dig> and the nearby pvuii restriction fragments were quantitatively detected . we measured the crosslinking frequencies between these baits and the various pvuii sites throughout the fshd locus. d <dig>  and d <dig>  showed one intrachromosomal loop between the d4z <dig> array and the frg <dig> promoter  in human myoblasts, and two additional interactions with the tubb4q gene . interestingly, the d4z4/frg <dig> promoter interaction was specific to the pvuii fragment-containing carg box . additional file 6a shows an example of these findings.

to test the correlation between the derived chromatin structure and the transcriptional potential of the frg <dig> promoter, we performed similar 3c analyses after myogenic differentiation. in striking contrast to the presence of long-range associations between d4z <dig>  frg <dig> and the tubb4q in undifferentiated myoblasts, myogenic differentiation led to an almost complete loss of the interaction with the frg <dig> promoter , and the locus acquired a more relaxed conformation; conversely, the interaction between d4z <dig> and tubb4q did not seem to be affected by the differentiation process . the same 3c analysis of a monochromosomal cell hybrid retaining human chromosome  <dig> gave similar results , thus demonstrating that the loops were formed between sequence elements localized on chromosome  <dig> 

to investigate whether dux4c could also mediate similar interactions, we set up a 3c analysis using the c <dig> and c <dig> baits described above. the use of c <dig> revealed an interaction between the frg <dig> promoter and the dux4c fragment that did not change during differentiation , whereas no interactions were revealed by c <dig> . notably, the relative crosslinking frequency was one order of magnitude lower with the dux4c bait than with the d4z <dig> baits .

as the expression of the frg <dig> gene is misregulated in fshd cells , we investigated whether the d4z <dig> contraction affects loop formation by making the same 3c analysis of fshd myoblasts and myotubes, but we did not find any significant differences from controls . however, reasoning that the wild-type allele may mask a possible small reduction in the frequency of the interactions, we used a 3c quantitative pcr  assay in order to determine the crosslinking frequencies of the f7-d <dig> interaction more accurately  <cit> . we designed a taqman probe complementary to the frg <dig> promoter of the hybrid fragment generated by 3c, and normalized the 3c-qpcr results following the same procedures as those used for the other 3c-pcrs . this time, there was a slight but statistical significant reduction in the interaction frequency of the fshd myoblasts . however, it is possible that a difference in the d4z4-frg <dig> interaction between normal and fshd cells  may lead to a variation that is too small to be detected by the 3c assay. these findings suggest that the fshd locus in muscle cells is structured into at least three intrachromosomal loops: two steady loops connecting d4z4-tubb4q, and one dynamic loop between d4z <dig> and the frg <dig> promoter that is relaxed during myogenic differentiation. this indicates that the higher order structure of these elements undergoes dynamic remodeling, which probably correlates with the disappearance of the polycomb complex from both the frg <dig> promoter and the d4z <dig> array, and is concomitant with the upregulation of gene expression. moreover, the ability to form loops between the frg <dig> promoter and the d4z <dig> array seems to be less efficient in fshd myoblasts than in controls.

discussion
facioscapulohumeral dystrophy is considered an epigenetic disorder  <cit> . abnormalities in the expression of candidate genes such as ant <dig>  frg <dig> and frg <dig>  and in the transcription of the d4z <dig> repeat, have been reported in fshd patients  <cit> , but the chromatin features of the fshd locus have not been studied in detail.

we found that the upregulation of frg <dig> in fshd patients is a gain of function mechanism that could explain the autosomal dominant inheritance of the disease, and that it is revealed only when myogenic differentiation triggers the remodeling of the locus. frg1p is a nuclear protein that is thought to be involved in rna processing  <cit> . slight differences in the cell levels of regulatory proteins such as frg1p may affect a number of factors and have multiple effects on cell physiology. for instance, the alternative splicing of muscle-specific genes is abnormally regulated in mice overexpressing frg <dig> and showing an fshd phenotype  <cit> , and so inappropriate regulation of frg <dig> during the early phases of muscle differentiation may have serious effects on the formation of muscle fiber. we suggest that frg <dig> misregulation in a specific window of muscle differentiation may contribute to fshd, although it cannot be considered the only molecular defect causing the fshd phenotype: for example, the transcription of dux <dig> recently observed in fshd myoblasts  <cit>  may contribute to the manifestation of fshd.

in order to investigate the molecular basis of the frg <dig> transcriptional alteration, we made a detailed analysis of the chromatin structure of two dna regions residing in the fshd locus in a human model of myogenic differentiation: the candidate gene frg <dig> and the d4z <dig> array, to which the genetic mutation underlying the disease has been mapped. these two dna regions were studied at different levels of the epigenome, from dna methylation and histone code modifications to higher order structures. in this regard, it is important to point out the intrinsic limitation of molecularly analyzing repetitive dna elements, and so we used the complementary approaches of chip and 3d-fish analysis to gain insights into the chromatin structure of d4z <dig> 

the analyses showed that the fshd locus undergoes chromatin remodeling during myogenic differentiation. in normal myoblasts, the frg <dig> gene is repressed and its promoter physically interacts with the d4z <dig> array; upon differentiation, the polycomb complex dissociates from the frg <dig> promoter and the frg <dig> gene is expressed. like the frg <dig> promoter, d4z <dig> chromatin also shows the presence of the polycomb complex and h3k27me <dig> in myoblasts, and their loss in myotubes; moreover, d4z <dig> and the frg <dig> promoter physically interact in myoblasts, whereas this chromatin loop is relaxed upon myogenic differentiation.

these data support the hypothesis that the 4q d4z <dig> array may have a regulatory effect on frg <dig> expression, which we suggest is due to their physical association in the nucleus. it has recently been demonstrated that polycomb occupancy can repress transcription by maintaining a series of long-range chromatin interactions that are lost when mammalian cells differentiate  <cit> , and so it would be interesting to investigate directly the involvement of the polycomb repressor complex as a mediator of the frg1-d4z <dig> chromatin loop in myoblasts.

chromatin characterization of frg <dig> and the d4z <dig> array in fshd myoblasts revealed a reduction in h3k27me <dig> on the contracted d4z <dig> allele, and a kinetic analysis of polycomb dissociation during differentiation that was very similar to that observed in the control cells. the reduction in h3k27me <dig> may be due to the decrease in the number of d4z <dig> units or to hypomethylation of the residual repeats. furthermore, the early expression of frg <dig> in differentiating fshd myoblasts may indicate that muscle cells, like their non-muscle counterparts, require the recruitment of additional factors in order to activate frg <dig> expression.

in our cell system, the regulation of frg <dig> expression therefore seems to be preferentially conditioned by the chromatin structure of the region . we found a slight reduction in the frequency of loop formation between the d4z <dig> array and the frg <dig> promoter in fshd myoblasts in comparison with control cells. d4z <dig> contraction in fshd cells may qualitatively alter the repressive effect of this chromatin loop affecting the correct timing of frg <dig> expression. it is possible that relaxed looping in the presence of protein factors that may induce further changes in chromatin conformation and/or more efficient transcription allows the expression of the frg <dig> gene. nonetheless, the observed reduction in the frequency of loop formation between the d4z <dig> array and the frg <dig> promoter in fshd myoblasts is too small to certainly infer its involvement in the misregulation of frg <dig> gene expression, and thus further experiments are required to link macrosatellite contraction and gene expression.

pirozhokova et al.  <cit>  published a 3c analysis of the fshd locus and described the formation of loops between dux4c and the frg <dig> promoter. we detected the same loop in myoblasts, although the frequency of the interaction was one order of magnitude lower than that of the loop between frg <dig> and d4z <dig> sequences. the same authors also found a second loop between a telomeric element downstream of the d4z <dig> array  and the frg <dig> promoter only in fshd myoblasts, and suggested that this element may enhance the transcription of the gene  <cit> . as we did not detect frg <dig> up regulation in fshd myoblasts, we suggest that the interaction with the 4qa/b marker have the proposed effect of transcription enhancement on frg <dig> expression only when myogenic differentiation is triggered. our data, together with data of petrov et al. and pirozhokova et al. indicate that the tridimensional structure of the fshd region is functional for the expression of the frg <dig> gene, and probably more than one sequence elements  could contribute to the fine regulation of gene expression  <cit> .

finally, our model may also explain the manifestation of fshd in the absence of d4z <dig> contraction, as in the case of phenotypic fshd in which a wild-type 4q d4z <dig> array is strongly hypomethylated  <cit> . in this case, d4z <dig> hypomethylation may impair the polycomb recruitment that leads to a reduction in h3k <dig> trimethylation, the same molecular defect that we observed in contracted 4q alleles.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study provide the first demonstration of a mechanistic link between the d4z <dig> array and the transcriptional regulation of muscle-specific frg <dig> via intrachromosomal looping. this finding may predict a broader role of the d4z <dig> array in coordinating regulatory interactions between non-contiguous elements in the genome. the identification of such in cis or in trans interactions may untangle the intricate cascade of events underlying the manifestation of fshd and may suggest that this human disorder is an example of the structural modification of the epigenome.
