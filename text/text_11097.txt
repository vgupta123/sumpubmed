BACKGROUND
impairment of blood–spinal cord barrier  leading to spinal cord edema is the second common insult after ischemia reperfusion  injury and it is associated with poor prognosis, such as paralysis or even death  <cit> . several studies have indicated that disruption of bscb caused some important pathological changes including swollen perivascular glial end feets , breaking down of endothelial tight junctions  and vascular basal lamina , which were frequently associated with deregulated expression of water-channel protein aquaporins   <cit> . aqps are known as small integral membrane proteins of epithelial and/or glial cells that permit passive water diffusion in development of cytotoxic as well as vasogenic edema during various pathophysiological injury such as neuroinflammation, ischemia and trauma  <cit> . so far,  <dig> subtypes of aqps in mammals with specific distribution in different organs and tissues have been identified, among which aqp <dig> is highly expressed in nervous system. it provided another major pathway for water homeostasis in except of aqp <dig>  <cit> . activation of aqp <dig> at both protein and mrna levels have been proven to associate with damage to blood–brain barrier  and to facilitate cytotoxic edema  formation following cerebral ir  <cit> . further, genetic deletion of aqp <dig> was suggested to ameliorate brain swelling, whereas it had deleterious effects in pathogenesis of vasogenic edema , suggesting bidirectional contributor to the formation and clearance in cerebral edema  <cit> . in contrast to cerebral edema, contradictory roles of aqp <dig> in spinal cord edema formation have been described in previous studies  <cit> . hence, it requires further study to elucidate whether there are two different kinds of tissue edema, cytotoxic and vasogenic edema existing in procedure of spinal cord ir and to further clarify the underlying mechanisms regulating aqp <dig> 

micrornas  are  <dig> nucleotides long non-codeing rna that specifically interact with the 3′-utr of its target mrna gene expression by posttranscriptional mechanisms in many biologic processes and disease states . studies have showed that several mirs could dramatically alter normal physiological processes and involve in the pathogenesis of bbb function  <cit> . recent studies confirmed the effect of mir- <dig> on the regulation of intestinal barrier through targeting aqp <dig> in mice with intestinal ischemic injury  <cit> . furthermore, there was evidence to support that mir-130a, a strong transcriptional repressor of the aqp <dig> m <dig> isoform, could up-regulate transcription of aqp <dig> m <dig> transcript and cause a reduction in cerebral infarct and promote recovery  <cit> . these findings suggested that mirs could be used as potential regulators to modulate aqp <dig> in spinal cord edema after ir. in this study, we aimed to identify potential mirs involved in ir to address above issues.

RESULTS
determination of spinal water content after ir injury
figure 1a showed spinal water content in rats of sham and ir group evaluated by dry-wet method during 60 h post-injury. there were significant increases in water content in ir group at all observed time points , suggesting development of spinal cord swelling induced by 14-min of thoracic aortic occlusion. similar to the bimodal disruption of bscb, quantitative data appeared to be a m-shape curve with first peak at 12 h and lessened from 18 h, then aggravated again beginning at 36 h and reached the second peak at 48 h and afterwards. on the other hand, water content in sham group maintained almost the same level during all observed time points .fig.  <dig>

pathological changes in bscb after ir injury
our recent study has demonstrated that bimodal disruption of bscb was occurred at  <dig> and 48 h after injury in a rat model of spinal cord ir injury  <cit> . based on previous work, we estimated that different edema formation such as cytotoxic and/or vasogenic spinal edema might be involved in the process of bscb integrity damage and examined by transmission electron microscope . our observation revealed that at 12 h after ir, cytotoxic  edema began to appear with the presence of glial cell foot process swelling and thickened basilar membranes but intact endothelial tj, whereas at 48 h after ir, angioedema appeared consecutively as breakdown of endothelial tj and vascular basal lamina with more apparent cell swelling, suggesting the formation of mixed edema. moreover, there was no abnormal morphology of bscb structure in ir group at 6 h and in sham group at all observed time points .

effects of aqp <dig> expression and colocalization with different cell types of bscb in spinal cord after ir
compared to sham group, the protein expressions of aqp <dig> in spinal cords of ir group gradually increased with time and maintained a dramatically high level after 48 h post-injury . there were no significant differences between these two groups at 6 h after surgery.fig.  <dig> temporal relationship of aqp <dig> expressions in spine cord after ir injury. a western blot analysis of aqp <dig> expression at different reperfusion time points after ir. b double immunofluorescence of aqp <dig> with different cell types of bscb at  <dig> and 48 h after ir, for bscb was suggested maximally damaged at above time points. lines show the border of the vessels. arrows show their co-localizations. scale bars 100 μm. c integrated density values of aqp <dig> in ir group with different reperfusion time points. after normalized against sham group, ir-induced aqp1-upregulation increased with time. **p <  <dig>  versus sham group. d quantification of aqp1-positive cell types of bscb after ir . data are presented as mean numbers of positive cells/area/spinal section ± sem . **p <  <dig>  versus sham group; ##

immunofluorescent stain was only performed at  <dig> and 48 h as bscb dysfunction was suggested to reach maximal level at these two time points. it was correlated well with spinal cord swelling  <cit> . continuous capillary endothelial cells, astrocytes, and perivascular microglia are the major cellular components of the bscb. with the understanding that aqp <dig> may play an important role in maintaining water homeostasis and bscb integrity, we further identified a specific cell population in bscb with the following cellular markers: cd <dig> , gfap  and iba- <dig>  . based on our results, at 12 h after surgery, the majority of aqp <dig> was colocalized with the distribution of astrocytes in ir group, whereas at 48 h, most colocalization was focused on both endothelial cells and astrocytes, but not in microglial cells and all cell types in sham-operated ones. it suggested that ir-induced aqp <dig> upregulation in astrocytes appeared at the early phase of bscb dysfunction and endothelial cells emerged with the development of injury. quantification data of double-labeled cells with aqp <dig> in fig. 2d showed similar results. however, no identical fluorescence label of aqp <dig> was found in microglial cells of rats undergoing ir or sham-operation at the above time points.

screening of mirnas targeting aqp <dig> mrna 3′utr after ir
we performed microarray analysis and bioinformatic search to determine whether there were potential mirs involved in regulation aqp <dig> mrna after ir. the results showed that compared with sham group, in ir group, ten mirs were upregulated  and seven mirs were downregulated  at 12 h after surgery , and ten mirs were upregulated  and eleven mirs were downregulated  at 48 h after surgery . among these aberrant mirnas, ten mirs  were reported to be differentially expressed at both  <dig> and 48 h after ir. further searching about mirs in targetscan and microcosm targets databases showed that only mir-320a was highly complementary to the 3′-utr of aqp <dig> and hypothesized to target their transcripts. the results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  showed that mir-320a was expressed at significantly low level after ir and continuously decreased with time . then the potential link was demonstrated by dual luciferase reporter assay. we co-transfected hek- <dig> cells with luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 3′-utr of aqp <dig>  and anti-mir-320a or pre-mir-320a. co-transfection with anti-mir-320a exhibited an increase in the relative luciferase expression, whereas pre-mir-320a strongly inhibited luciferase activity. moreover, no effects were observed in cells transfected with mutated mir-320a binding site of aqp <dig> . collectively, these results indicated that mir-320a could directly target aqp <dig> and their interactions would be further verified in a rat ir model.fig.  <dig> screening of mirnas targeting aqp <dig> mrna 3′utr after ir. a hierarchical cluster analyses of altered micrornas  in spinal cords at 12 h  and 48 h  after ir . each row represents an mir, and each column represents a sample. the mirs that were upregulated are shown in green to red, whereas the mirs that were downregulated are shown from red to green. among all the significantly changed mirs, mir-320a was reported to be differentially expressed at both  <dig> and 48 h after ir. b quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  analysis confirming the mir-320a was abnormally expressed at both  <dig> and 48 h after ir. relative expression is the change in expression compared to the sham-operated group. data are expressed as mean ± sem. c direct interaction between mir-320a and the 3′-utr of aqp <dig>  hek-293t cells were co-transfected with anti- or pre-mir-320a and a pmir-rb-report™ luciferase reporter plasmid containing with either wild or mutant mir-320a binding site of aqp <dig>  compared to control-transfected cells, anti-mir-320a exhibited an increase in the relative luciferase expression, whereas pre-mir-320a strongly inhibited luciferase activity. data are expressed as mean ± sem. **p <  <dig>  versus the control mir. results shown are representative data from three separate experiments

intrathecal pretreatment with mir-320a mimic and amo successfully regulated aqp <dig> expression in vivo after ir
to explore the interactions of mir-320a with aqp <dig> in spinal cord tissues, we intrathecally injected mimic-320a, amo-320a, and nc-320a continuously 3 days before ischemia. both the mrna and protein expression of aqp <dig> were examined by rt-pcr and western blotting, respectively. as shown in fig.  <dig>  compared with sham group, intrathecal injection with mimic-320a significantly prevented ir-induced increases in aqp <dig> mrna and protein expressions at  <dig> and 48 h after ir, whereas pretreatment with amo-320a reversed above changes . there were no significant differences between ir group and nc-320a group at above time points .fig.  <dig> effects of intrathecal injection of mir-320a mimics and amo on expressions of aqp <dig> in a rat ir modal. a representative western blot probed with antibodies against aqp <dig> and β-actin as loading control in spinal cord  <dig> and 48 h after ir. b the protein level of aqp <dig> was calculated after normalizing to sham group and presented in relative units. c real-time pcr analyses of aqp <dig> were performed in duplicate and normalized to sham group. intrathecal injection of mimic-320a prevented ir-induced increases in aqp <dig> expression in spinal cord after ir, whereas amo-320a treatment synergistically increased the expressions. all data are presented as mean ± sem. **p <  <dig>  versus sham group; ##

furthermore, quantification of water content confirmed above results . i/r induced increases in water content due to spinal cord edema. intrathecal infusion of mir-320a mimic markedly attenuated these effects at all observed time points , whereas treatment with amo-320a synergistically increased water content .

bscb permeability was visualized by eb dye and quantified by eb extravasation. as shown in fig. 5c–e, there was almost no red fluorescence observed in rats without subjected to aortic arch occlusion  at both  <dig> and 48 h after ir. compared with sham group, ir caused markedly increases in the amount of eb extravasation and fluorescent densities at  <dig> and 48 h after ir . intrathecal pretreatment with mir-320a mimic significantly weakened eb extravasation and fluorescent densities, and conversely much more eb, especially in the gray matter could be seen in rats pretreated with amo-320a at above time points . there were no detectable differences in eb extravasation between the ir group and nc-320a group .

discussion
spinal cord edema is one of the most serious complications following spinal cord ir injury that closely associated with long-term disability in patients or even death  <cit> . pathologically speaking, spinal cord edema is a result of increased spinal water content due to excess accumulation of water in the intracellular or extracellular spaces from the dysfunction of bscb  <cit> . our previous work has reported that ir-induced bimodal disruption of bscb and exhibited more pronounced vascular disruptions at 48 h than those at 12 h after surgery.  <cit> . in this study, we further identified the factors that modulating bscb integrity and found endogenous modulator to retard the spinal cord edema progression.

bscb is comprised of the cells  and cellular elements   <cit> . based on the morphological and structural change of bscb, spinal cord edema is mainly divided into cytotoxic edema  and vasogenic edema , and both can be initiated by trauma, ischemia and inflammation  <cit> . it is known that cytotoxic edema causes perivascular glial endfeets swelling for simply a water shift from extracellular to intracellular compartments, and eventually breakdown of endothelial tjs and vascular basal lamina allows for extravasated warer ultrafiltrate and formation of vasogenic edema  <cit> . to confirm the above conclusion, our pathological observation by tem  showed that at 12 h after ir, cytotoxic edema was detected with presence of glial cell foot process swelling and thickened basilar membranes but intact endothelial tj, whereas at 48 h, two kinds of edema formed mixed edema with presence of both breakdown of cellular elements and more apparent cell swelling. besides, spinal water content gradually increased at 12 h and dramatically increased over 48 h , such observation was consistent with the study of stokum et al.  <cit> . they suggested that cytotoxic edema by itself did not cause similar increases in tissue volume or mass as those by vasogenic edema in brain. lu hong’s study was also designed to employ the relationship of traumatic brain edema and bbb structure  <cit> . they showed that vasogenic edema was characterized by structural bbb damage, such as endothelial cell and mitochondrial swelling, basilar membrane abruption, as well as dilatation of endoplasmic reticulum. the bbb damaged could be aggravated by mixed cerebral edema that consisting of vasogenic edema and cellular edema with prolonged times  <cit> .

spinal cord edema is often long lasting and resistant to therapeutic intervention and thus the mechanisms that promote water flux across bscb is worth further investigating  <cit> . previous studies showed deregulated expressions of water-channel protein aquaporins  anchoring at the perivascular membrane frequently led to a net loss of bscb and parallel increases in spinal water content  <cit> . given the involvement of aqp <dig> in cerebral edema , we first examined temporal expressions of aqp <dig> during the time course of ir injury by western blot . studies have confirmed that upregulation of aqp <dig> may participate in vasogenic edema formation  <cit> . similarly, the protein level of aqp <dig> was gradually increasing during the early phase of bimodal disruption but dramatically increased after 48 h afterwards, providing potential molecular mechanisms of the generation vasogenic edema during the second disruption of bscb. another study of vasogenic edema formation also confirmed that aqp <dig> gene knockout rats exhibited a 56 % reduction in blood-cerebrospinal fluid versus wild-type mice under isomolar conditions  <cit> .

to better contextualize their contribution to vasogenic or cytotoxic edema, we further explore the collocation of aqps with specific cellular compositions of bscb during bimodal bscb disruption. the results showed that gfap staining started to increase in number of cells and enhance staining intensities with time and peaked at  <dig> and 48 h after ir, whereas the cd <dig> staining became greatly increased at 48 h. to explain the different activation phases of astrocytes and endothelial cells, one can easily considered that different degrees of bscb leakage and different types of edema conformation involved. furthermore, the quantitative analysis showed aqp <dig> was mainly expressed in astrocytes during early cytotoxic edema, while during later mixed edema, aqp <dig> was expressed both in endothelial cells and astrocytes, confirming that endothelial cells participated in vasogenic edema formation. previous studies have supported the existence of species specificity of aqps localization in nervous system  <cit> . for instance, several reports demonstrate that aqp <dig> was highly co-distributed in human astrocytes and specialized for water transport both in vitro and in vivo under the pathological condition  <cit> . on the other hand, most aqp <dig> was restricted to endothelial cells of blood vessels and choroid plexus to control cerebral spinal fluid secretion  <cit> . these findings, together with the present results, suggested that the essential role of aqp <dig> in regulating water transport and balance during bimodal disruption of bscb after ir.

aberrant expressions of aqp <dig> might induce a sustained imbalance of water influx and efflux during reperfusion and finally lead to bscb disruption. enhanced aqp <dig> has been demonstrated as a primary factor for the water transport and associated with persistent edema following hypoxia  <cit> . factors that reducing the aqp <dig> expression after ir would necessarily maintain bscb integrity and inhibit the spread of edema to improve the prognosis. mirs are single-stranded rna that function as negative regulators of gene expression by either the translational repression or degradation of mrna targets . aberrant mirna expression has been proposed as therapeutic targets in the pathogenesis of ir  <cit> . in these analyses, no changes in luciferase activity were detected when mutated reporter was co-transfected with either pre- or anti-mir, suggesting that aqp <dig> was genuine targets of mir-320a . it has been known that single mir is capable of regulating expressions of various target genes, in converse, one target gene can be regulated by several mirs . thus, to verify the effects of mir-320a on the edema-associated outcome was required to be tested in vivo. it was recently shown that intrathecal injection with mir mimics and amos into the subarachnoid space was a common and useful method to regulate the mirs expressions in animal model  <cit> . in vivo data also showed that intrathecal pretreatment with mimic-320a clearly reduced the mrna and protein expressions of aqp <dig> by compensating for decreased mir-320a levels, whereas injection with amo-320a clearly abrogated such changes. further, no obvious changes were detected when pretreated with negative control mirs, suggesting that mir-320a directly modulated aqp <dig> both in vitro and in vivo.

sepramaniam et al.  <cit>  suggested that spinal cord injury -induced a mixture of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema involved different mechanisms. given the complexity of mixed edema during second disruption of bscb, we thus focused on 48 h post-injury to determine the net effects of mir-320a during ir in vivo. it showed that ir induced by 14-min aortic arch occlusion produced severe hind-limb motor functional deficits, along with increased bscb leakage. our present study provided clear evidence for the protective effects of mir-320a on neurological outcomes and bscb permeability. specifically, increasing mir-320a expression by intrathecal injection of mir mimics increased average tarlov scores, reduced fluorescent dye and eb extravasation, whereas above effects were reversed by injection of amo. we suggested that protective effects of aqp <dig> deletion during mixed edema were likely contributed to maintain bscb integrity by mitigating astrocytes swelling, removal of excess water through glial and endothelial barriers  <cit> . of note, one major character of mirs is that single mir is capable of regulating many target genes through recognition of a continuous 6-base pair “seed match” near the 3′-utr of its targets  <cit> . given this, many target genes of mir-320a have been identified. apart from regulating structure of bscb, some studies have showed that protective effects of mir- <dig> involved in regulation heat shock protein- <dig> by inhibiting apoptosis during ir  <cit> . since multiple mechanisms involved in neuroprotection after ir and complicated internal environment of in vivo experiments, it is very possible to gain different or even contradictory net effects when exploring the same mir in differently experimental conditions. further in vitro and in vivo studies still need to be conducted to better elucidate the mechanisms and provide therapeutic targets for spinal cord edema.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified that mir-320a directly and functionally modulated aqp <dig> expression in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. inhibition of aqp <dig> might provide a new therapeutic alternative for maintenance of bscb integrity and treatment of spinal edema.
