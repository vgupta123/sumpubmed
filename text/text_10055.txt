BACKGROUND
lysophosphatidic acid  is a signalling phospholipid mediating multiple biological responses, such as cellular proliferation, prevention of apoptosis, and platelet aggregation, and is involved in the development and function of the nervous, cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems  <cit> . aberrant lpa signalling has been claimed to be associated with the pathology of common human diseases, such as arteriosclerosis  <cit>  and cancer  <cit> . signalling by lpa is mainly mediated through specific g protein-coupled receptors   <cit> . the receptors for lpa are widely expressed, being found in the brain, circulation and digestive tract. currently, there are five gpcrs that have been identified as bona fide receptors for lpa  along with a putative sixth receptor   <cit> .

physiologically relevant levels of lpa can be found in serum and other body fluids. in addition, several cell types, including platelets, adipocytes, and ovarian cancer cells, can produce and release lpa. significant amounts of lpa have been detected from brain tissue  <cit> . it is postulated that the majority of bioactive lpa is generated extracellularly from lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholine , by the plasma ecto-enzyme, lysophospholipase d, identical to autotaxin, an autocrine motility factor originally isolated from the conditioned medium of cancer cells  <cit> . intracellularly, lpa can be generated by phospholipase a1/a <dig>  -catalyzed deacylation of phosphatidic acid   <cit> . other proposed pathways for lpa generation include de novo biosynthesis either from glycerol-3-phosphate  by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase or from monoacylglycerol  by monoacylglycerol kinase  <cit> .

after being produced, the lifetime of the signalling pool of lpa is thought to be controlled by enzymatic degradation. lpa is rapidly dephosphorylated by a family of integral membrane proteins known as lipid phosphate phosphatases   <cit> . the lpp family  comprises four members  which dephosphorylate their lipid substrates, namely lpa, pa, sphingosine 1-phosphate , and ceramide 1-phosphate  <cit> . all the lpp subtypes are expressed in the brain  <cit>  but very little is known about their functional roles. a hallmark of lpp activity is that it does not require mg2+ and is resistant to the alkylating agent, n-ethylmaleimide   <cit> . the other known pathways for lpa metabolism include de novo formation of pa by lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase and lysophospholipase -catalyzed hydrolysis of the acyl group to form glycerophosphate  <cit> . the two degradative pathways generating inorganic phosphate  as a result of lpa degradation are depicted in figure  <dig> 

35 s]gtpγs autoradiography represents a powerful functional approach to anatomically localize receptor-dependent gi/o protein activity directly in brain cryosections . in addition to a receptor’s anatomical distribution, 35 s]gtpγs autoradiography can monitor the receptor-g protein axis in its native cellular microenvironment and is therefore often referred to as functional autoradiography. our previous studies have demonstrated that brain sections retain the capacity to generate endogenous gpcr agonists, such as adenosine and lpa, during incubation. this results in tonic adenosine a <dig> and lpa receptor activity in anatomically defined brain regions and therefore serves as a convenient functional readout to monitor agonist activity at the two receptors  <cit> . the lpa-evoked 35 s]gtpγs binding response in rat brain sections reflects lpa <dig> receptor activity, as it is sensitive to the lpa1/3-selective antagonist ki <dig> and is restricted to the developing white matter tracts  <cit> . this labelling pattern faithfully mirrors the known expression pattern of lpa <dig> receptors in the developing rat brain  <cit> .

our previous studies indicated that the enzymatic machinery generating and metabolizing membrane-derived lipid mediators was well preserved in brain cryosections. we recently demonstrated that a comprehensive elimination of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol  in brain sections leads to 2-ag accumulation and subsequent cannabinoid cb <dig> receptor activation, as successfully revealed using functional autoradiography  <cit> . using this approach, we show here that pharmacological inhibition of lpp activity in brain sections with vanadate or propranolol results in amplification of lpa <dig> receptor signalling with no net effect on global lpa phosphatase activity at the bulk brain level, also attributable to mg2+ -independent, nem-resistant lpp-like phosphatases. we show further that the phosphate analog alfx- not only potentiates lpa <dig> receptor signalling, but also totally prevents lpa degradation, resulting in the accumulation of several lpa species in brain sections, as demonstrated by lc/ms/ms measurements. the presently described approach offers a versatile tool to monitor the strength of lipid-gpcr signalling axis in anatomically defined brain structures and may prove useful also for further studies exploring enzymatic pathways estimating the lifetime of still uncharacterized endogenous signalling lipids.

RESULTS
the lpp inhibitors na3vo <dig> and propranolol locally amplify lpa <dig> receptor signalling without affecting global lpa degradation
the lpp-mediated degradation of lpa is susceptible to the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate   <cit>  and to propranolol  <cit> , better known as a classical β-adrenoceptor blocking agent e.g. used in the treatment of hypertension. another β-blocker, nadolol, has no demonstrable lpp inhibiting capacity  <cit>  and therefore can serve as a useful control compound. we tested the effects of these compounds on basal lpa <dig> receptor signalling. treatment of brain sections with propranolol  or na3vo <dig>  resulted in stimulated 35 s]gtpγs binding responses that were restricted to the white matter areas of 4 week-old rat brain . the observed labelling pattern was fully reproduced by the addition of exogenous lpa  and all the evoked responses, including the tonic lpa <dig> receptor activity observed under basal conditions, were abolished by treatment with the lpa1/ <dig> receptor selective antagonist ki <dig>  . previously, we demonstrated that ki <dig> dose-dependently diminished the basal and lpa-evoked 35 s]gtpγs binding responses in the white matter tracts   <cit> . dose–response studies revealed that the maximal effective concentrations for na3vo <dig> and propranolol were 100 μm and 1 mm, respectively . as expected, treatment with nadolol  had no effect on basal lpa <dig> receptor signalling . both na3vo <dig> and propranolol, but not nadolol, amplified the lpa-evoked  binding responses . to rule out the direct agonism of propranolol and vanadate at the lpa <dig> receptor, we performed classical filtration-based 35 s]gtpγs binding assay and found that neither compound was able to stimulate 35 s]gtpγs binding to the rat cerebellar membranes, whereas exogenous lpa evoked a dose-dependent response . we additionally observed that the lpa <dig> receptor-preferring agonist -ompt  induced only a weak response in the brain of a 4-week old rat when compared to signal achieved with exogenous lpa  -ompt). this lends further support to the argument that observed lpa-evoked signalling is reflecting the activity of the myelin enriched lpa <dig> receptors instead of lpa <dig> receptors that are expressed to a lesser degree in the brain  <cit> . finally, we found that exogenously added autotaxin substrate lpc did not boost tonic lpa <dig> receptor activity suggesting that tonic lpa <dig> activity in brain sections is not due to lpa formed as a result of autotaxin activity .

the lpps catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphate group of their lipid substrates resulting in the generation of inorganic phosphate . the measurement of the released pi offers a straightforward way to monitor lpp activity  <cit> . in preliminary experiments, incubation of brain sections with exogenously added lpa, pa and s1p resulted in pi formation, indicating that lysophospholipid-degrading phosphatases were active under the assay conditions employed . to confirm that pi generation was dependent on brain tissue, empty slides were incubated under identical conditions but in this case, there was no generation of pi from lpa . further studies with lpa  indicated, that lpp-like phosphatase activity accounted for the majority of lpa degradation, as ~ 93% of lpa-derived pi was formed as a result of mg2+-independent, nem-resistant phosphatase activity . in the routine assay buffer containing mg2+, 46 ± 1%  of exogenous lpa  was degraded during the 90 min incubation whereas in the mg2+-free assay buffer supplemented with nem , the respective figure was 44 ± 3%. however, neither the lpp inhibitors na3vo <dig> , propranolol , nor nadolol  affected total lpa phosphatase activity in a statistically significant manner, assessed at the bulk level of brain sections . in line with this, when the lpa content of brain sections treated with na3vo <dig> or propranolol was analyzed using lc/ms/ms, there was no significant accumulation of lpa when compared to control sections that were incubated in the absence of these inhibitors . we undertook a search for additional inhibitors in an attempt to identify compounds that could comprehensively target the global pool of lpa phosphatases in brain sections.

the phosphate analog aluminium fluoride amplifies lpa <dig> receptor signalling and totally prevents lpa degradation resulting in bulk accumulation of endogenous lpa species
sodium fluoride  is commonly used as a phosphatase inhibitor. aluminium fluoride  acts as a transition stage phosphate analog also capable of inhibiting several phosphatases  <cit> . alfx- forms spontaneously in aqueous solutions in the presence of aluminium  and fluoride ions. we pretreated brain sections with naf or alfx- in order to test whether these compounds could affect lpa receptor activity and/or lpa degradation. interestingly, when sections were pretreated with alfx- , a stimulated 35 s]gtpγs binding response throughout the lpa <dig> receptor-enriched white matter regions was evident . this labelling pattern was fully mimicked by the addition of exogenous lpa  , and was blocked by ki <dig>  . similarly, pretreatment of brain sections with naf  resulted in stimulated 35 s]gtpγs binding responses throughout the white matter regions . pretreatment with these compounds was sufficient to evoke lpa <dig> receptor signalling, suggesting that in contrast to the reversibly acting inhibitors na3vo <dig> and propranolol , alfx- and naf had inhibited lpp activity in an irreversible manner.

we wished to explore in more detail the mode of inhibition of these compounds, as well as the behaviour of naf in our experimental setting. this was justified by the fact that aluminium is a common constituent of glassware and f- can etch it from the glass. deforoxamine mesylate  is an aluminium and iron chelator that can be used in experimental settings to reveal if aluminium is present in the system. when brain sections were treated with dfom , the responses to alfx- and naf  in functional autoradiography were totally abolished . it is noteworthy that dfom needed to be added together with alfx- or naf in order to achieve this reversal; if added after pretreatment with alfx- or naf, dfom was ineffective . these studies indicate that alfx- acted as an irreversible inhibitor of brain lpp activity thereby amplifying tonic lpa <dig> receptor activity. the general phosphatase inhibitor, naf per se, did not inhibit lpps, but mimicked the action of alfx- based on the ability of f- to etch al3+ from the glass slides.

we were curious to examine whether alfx- could also inhibit lpa degradation at the bulk brain level. when sections were pretreated with alfx- but then omitted from all subsequent steps, alfx- readily facilitated lpa <dig> receptor signalling , but such a pretreatment did not inhibit lpa degradation in a statistically significant manner. degradation of exogenous lpa  alone yielded  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol pi per slide whereas pretreatment with alfx- followed by incubation with exogenous lpa yielded  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol pi per slide . however, when added together with lpa, alfx- totally  blocked the formation of lpa-derived pi, thus providing evidence of the ability of these compounds to inhibit the vanadate- and propranolol-insensitive pool of lpa phosphatases in a reversible manner . treatment with dfom  totally prevented the ability of alfx- and naf to inhibit the degradation of lpa , indicating that alfx-, rather than naf, was the active compound.

to further explore the consequences of total inhibition of lpa phosphatase activity, alfx- -treated brain sections were incubated for 40 min in autoradiography buffer, the buffer was removed and tissue lpa content extracted using chloroform-methanol, followed by lc/ms/ms analysis. four lpa species with different acyl substitutions  were examined in the present study. the relative abundances of the four lpa species in brain sections incubated under control conditions were 20: <dig> lpa ≈ 16: <dig> lpa < 18: <dig> lpa < 18: <dig> lpa. the amounts of three of these species  were significantly increased after alfx- treatment when compared to control sections . these experiments indicate that total blockade of lpa phosphatase activity with alfx- treatment resulted in accumulation of several endogenous lpa species at the bulk brain level. however, no such bulk lpa accumulation was required to observe the alfx- -evoked potentiation of lpa <dig> receptor signalling.

the lpa → mag → g pathway efficiently degrades exogenous lpa whereas the lpa → gp → g pathway is inactive
in addition to the lpa → mag → g pathway , another pi generating pathway for lpa degradation involves its deacylation to form glycerophosphate which is further dephosphorylated by glycerophosphatases to glycerol  . since there are two degradative pathways for lpa that potentially release pi, we wished to clarify which pathway accounts for lpa degradation in our model. rat cerebellar membranes have been extensively used in our laboratory to study degradation of labile lipid messengers such as endocannabinoids  <cit> . since lpa <dig> receptors are known to be present in the cerebellum  <cit>  we performed kinetic monitoring of pi production from exogenous lpa and glycerol 3-phosphate  after incubation with rat cerebellar membranes in 96-well-format. in this setting, cerebellar membranes generated pi from lpa  but there was no pi generation from gp  , indicating that the pi formed from lpa in our experimental setting is principally due to lpp/lpp-like activity. as a further proof, we used the dephosphorylation-resistant thio-analog of lpa, -ompt, that is also the lpa <dig> receptor.-preferring agonist. as expected, there was no pi generation from -ompt  .

since both of the two pi releasing pathways for lpa degradation finally produce glycerol, we assessed cerebellar membrane-dependent glycerol generation from exogenous lpa in brain tissue. monoglyceride lipase  is believed to be mainly responsible for the mag → g conversion. in addition, two novel α/β-hydrolase domain containing proteins, abhd <dig> and abhd <dig>  have been identified to hydrolyze brain endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol   <cit>  and together the three serine hydrolases account for ~99% of brain 2-ag hydrolase activity  <cit> . it is therefore likely that in addition to mgl, abhd <dig> and abhd <dig> are involved in the degradation of both 1- and 2-monoacylglycerols. to delineate the relative contributions of the three hydrolases, we pretreated cerebellar membranes with two serine hydrolase inhibitors, methylarachidonoylfluorophosphonate  and compound jzl <dig>  the former is a potent, non-selective inhibitor of mgl  <cit>  that also inhibits abhd6/abhd <dig>  whereas the latter is a mgl-selective inhibitor  <cit> . as expected, in rat cerebellar membranes incubated together with lpa , glycerol production closely matches with pi generation , indicating that mag → g conversion takes place under the assay conditions employed. with mafp pretreatment , lpa-derived glycerol production was decreased by 91% . with jzl <dig> pretreatment , the corresponding reduction was 71% . the selectivity of the inhibitors towards mgl likely explains the difference in the inhibition of glycerol production from lpa between the two inhibitors. the time-dependent generation of pi and glycerol from exogenous lpa is presented in figure 7c. it appears that pi generation precedes that of g, a finding supporting sequential actions of phosphatases and lipases on the lpa → mag → g pathway.

discussion
functional autoradiography provides a straightforward approach to study the proximal step of signalling of various gi/o-coupled receptors in brain cryosections. we recently demonstrated that brain sections retain the capacity to generate endocannabinoids during incubations i.e. evidence of the ability of the brain sections to preserve sufficient functional enzymatic machinery to generate endogenous gpcr activating ligands  <cit> . the lifetime of the signalling pool of lpa is thought to be controlled by the equilibrium between synthesizing and degradative enzymatic activity. in the current study, we have characterized these enzymatic pathways and their role in tonic lpa <dig> receptor activity by pharmacologically manipulating the enzymatic machinery required for lpa degradation. we observed that in brain sections, the lifetime of bioactive lpa is controlled by mg2+-independent, nem-insensitive phosphatase activity attributable to lpps. pharmacological inhibition of this lpp activity by alfx-, propranolol or sodium orthovanadate amplified lpa <dig> receptor signalling, as revealed using functional autoradiography. we provided further evidence to show that the majority of brain lpa phosphatase activity seems to be carried out by lpp-like enzymatic activity which like lpp activity, is sensitive to alfx- but appears to be resistant to the two other lpp inhibitors, vanadate and propranolol. finally, we demonstrated that degradation of exogenous lpa is almost entirely channelled via the lpa → mag → g pathway and that mgl accounts for the majority of oleylglycerol-hydrolyzing activity in brain tissue.

all the three subtypes of mg2+-independent/nem resistant lpps are expressed in the brain, yet very little is known about the role of the lpps as regulators of lpa receptor signalling in the nervous system. knockout studies of all the lpp subtypes have been reported  <cit> . study with lpp <dig> knockout mice indicated that lpp <dig> plays a role in regulating the degradation of circulating lpa in vivo but that study failed to disrupt the lpp <dig> encoding gene in the brain, obscuring the function of lpp <dig> in the nervous system  <cit> . knockout of lpp <dig> turned out to be embryonically lethal  <cit>  whereas in vitro studies using cell lines lacking lpp <dig> address involvement of lpp <dig> in early neural development  <cit> . the lpps are likely to be involved in lpa dephosphorylation in brain cryosections, as brain sections efficiently generate pi from exogenous lpa largely in a nem resistant and mg2+-independent way. propranolol and vanadate have been demonstrated to inhibit lpps in various cell types  <cit> , vanadate also in the rat brain  <cit> . propranolol has been shown to act as a moderately effective inhibitor of lpps  <cit>  supporting our finding where the vanadate-induced response is relatively stronger when compared to the response observed with propranolol. since propranolol and vanadate amplified lpa <dig> receptor signalling only when present in the 35 s]gtpγs labelling step, these drugs presumably inhibit lpps in a reversible manner. in brain sections, lpp activity appears to locally control the lifetime of the signalling pool of lpa and lpps must therefore reside in close proximity to the lpa <dig> receptors, as propranolol and vanadate had no effect on lpa degradation when assessed at the bulk brain level.

in functional autoradiography, alfx- more efficiently induced the lpa <dig> receptor-mediated signal as compared to the signals observed with vanadate or propranolol. since alfx- is able to induce the lpa <dig> receptor-mediated signal when present only in the pre-incubation step, it appears to inhibit lpps in an irreversible manner. this proposal is supported by the finding that the al3+ chelator dfom failed to reverse alfx- -evoked response, if added only after pretreatment of brain sections with alfx- . alfx- is known to mimic the chemical structure of phosphate and therefore affects the activity of several phosphoryl transfer enzymes  <cit> . as a phosphate analog, alfx- might bind to the pi recognizing binding pocket of the lpps and by this mechanism lead to irreversible inhibition. all the studied inhibitors evoked 35 s]gtpγs binding responses that were largely restricted to the white matter areas of the brain when compared to grey matter  reflecting to selectivity towards the myelin-enriched lpa <dig> receptors. this also provides evidence to show, that though alfx- is known to act as a general activator of heterotrimeric g proteins, it seems not to induce global binding response in the grey matter areas and therefore seems not to act as a general g protein activator in functional autoradiography. it is notable that in contrast to propranolol and vanadate, when present in the latter step together with exogenous lpa, alfx- totally prevented the degradation of lpa at the bulk brain level, suggesting that in addition to irreversibly inhibiting lpps, alfx- can inhibit other lpp-like phosphatases in a reversible manner. based on the present findings, the major portion of brain lpa phosphatase activity appears to be attributable to the lpp-like phosphatases which in a similar manner as lpps, are sensitive to alfx- but resistant to the lpp inhibitors, vanadate and propranolol.

since there was no pi generation from exogenous glycerol 3-phosphate, it seems that lpa is predominantly degraded by the lpa → mag → g pathway in our experimental setting whereas the lpa → gp → g pathway plays a minor role. according to our findings, both phosphohydrolases  and mgl and related hydrolases  seem to be active. the pi- and glycerol -generating enzymatic routes involved in lpa degradation are summarized in additional file 8: summary of enzymatic routes generating pi and glycerol. previously, nem-insensitive lpa phosphohydrolase activity was studied in the nuclear fraction isolated from rabbit cerebral cortex  <cit> . this activity was found to be present also in the microsomal fraction. in the nuclear fraction, phosphohydrolase activity was found to be sensitive to naf  but virtually insensitive to propranolol . dephosphorylation by phosphohydrolases was found to be more active route for lpa degradation when compared to deacylation by lysophospholipases. it was also indicated that followed by dephosphorylation of lpa, monoacyl product is rapidly converted to glycerol by monoglyceride lipase. these findings support our present findings concerning active pathways involved in lpa degradation in brain as well as about the existence of lpp-like, propranolol and vanadate -insensitive, phosphohydrolase activity.

the lpp-like phosphatases remain to be characterized in future experiments. one interesting group of brain-specific membrane proteins are plasticity related genes  that have recently been identified and were originally proposed to act as lpa phosphatases  <cit> . among the family of prgs, prg- <dig> shares close homology to the lpps, having three conserved integral domains facing the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, the feature that enables lpps to dephosphorylate their lipid substrates. however, the catalytic residues responsible for lpp activity are not fully conserved in prgs  <cit>  suggesting that prgs might not act as lpa phosphatases. instead, pgr- <dig> was recently demonstrated to act at the postsynaptic side of the excitatory glutamatergic synapse where it could mediate the uptake of bioactive lipids  <cit> . prg- <dig> was found to effectively control the levels of lpa in the synapse though its mechanism of action seems to be more transporter-like than dephosphorylating. the transporter mechanism is not expected to be active in our experimental setting and therefore we hypothesize that prgs are not controlling lpa levels in our model.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that the lifetime of bioactive lpa is controlled by lpps in rat brain cryosections and that pharmacological inhibition of this lpp activity results in amplification of basal and lpa-stimulated lpa <dig> receptor activity. we conclude that lpp acts locally to control the lifetime of the signalling pool of lpa in the vicinity of lpa <dig> receptors whereas the majority of brain lpa phosphatase activity is attributable to additional lpp-like enzymatic activity. functional autoradiography represents a valuable tool for studies into lpa degradation by lpps and lpp-like enzymatic activity. compounds affecting lpa degradation could prove to be attractive targets for drug development, since altered lpa levels are associated with common human diseases, e.g. several forms of cancer. the approach described in this paper may also prove useful for further studies elucidating enzymatic pathways regulating the lifetime of still uncharacterized endogenous signalling lipids.
