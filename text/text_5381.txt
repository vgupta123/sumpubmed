BACKGROUND
wound infections are an ongoing problem not only for patients but also for healthcare providers worldwide. infected wounds are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, and an increase in the duration and the cost of hospital stay  <cit> . the growing resistance to conventional antibiotics among organisms that infect wounds and burns makes such infections difficult to treat  <cit> . therefore there is a drive to develop novel antimicrobial strategies to which pathogens will not easily develop resistance.

one promising alternative is photodynamic therapy . photodynamic therapy is the application of a non-toxic compound, termed a photosensitizer  or light-activated antimicrobial agent , which can be activated by light of an appropriate wavelength to produce reactive oxygen species   which can then exert a microbicidal effect  <cit> . light of the appropriate wavelength excites the ps molecule into a triplet state which reacts with either a substrate to produce radical ions which in turn react with oxygen to produce cytotoxic species such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals , or reacts directly with molecular oxygen to produce singlet oxygen  . pdt has a number of advantages over conventional antibiotics. firstly, as the mechanism of killing is non-specific, with reactive oxygen species causing damage to many bacterial components, resistance is unlikely to develop from repeated use  <cit> . secondly, both the ps and the light are applied locally to the target tissue; therefore reducing the risk of adverse systemic effects  <cit> . cutaneous wound infections are particularly appropriate for treatment by pdt due to their easy accessibility to both a topical ps and light. the organisms most frequently responsible for infections of wounds and burns are streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococci, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , and the gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . staphylococcus aureus is a common wound-infecting organism which results in delayed epithelial closure of the wound, possibly due to its interaction with fibronectin and inhibition of keratinocyte migration  <cit> . the eradication of wound-infecting bacteria using lethal photosensitization has been reported in the literature, e.g. staph. aureus  <cit> , p. aeruginosa  <cit> , strep. pyogenes  <cit> .

in this study we have investigated whether common wound-associated organisms are sensitive to lethal photosensitization using the dye indocyanine green  coupled with light from a near-infrared  laser emitting at  <dig> nm. this combination of ps and light source has a number of desirable characteristics over those described in the literature  <cit> . nir laser light has a greater capacity to penetrate tissues than light of lower wavelengths whilst icg is a nir-absorbing water-soluble tricarbocyanine dye, which has been approved by the united states food and drug administration  for medical diagnostic studies. icg has a very low toxicity and a high absorption at wavelengths around  <dig> nm. recently, pdt with icg has been used to treat tumors  <cit> . however it has, as yet, not been used for the pdt of infections with the exception of its topical use for the treatment of acne vulgaris  <cit> .

methods
bacteria
two gram-positive organisms were used in this study; staph. aureus strain 8325- <dig> and strep. pyogenes strain  <dig>  in addition, the gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pa <dig> was used. gram-positive bacteria were maintained by weekly subculture on blood agar base  supplemented with 5% horse blood whereas p. aeruginosa was subcultured on nutrient agar . staph. aureus and p. aeruginosa were grown aerobically in nutrient broth  with shaking at 37°c for  <dig> h. strep. pyogenes was grown in brain heart infusion broth  for  <dig> h at 37°c in an atmosphere of 5% co2/95% air. cells were then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline  to an optical density of  <dig>  at  <dig> nm which corresponded to approximately 106– <dig> colony forming units per ml  for the gram-positive bacteria and 108– <dig> cfu ml- <dig> for p. aeruginosa.

photosensitizer
 <dig> -benzoindotricarbocyanine  c43h47n2nao6s <dig> is a negatively-charged polymethine dye and was obtained from sigma-aldrich-uk. fresh stock solutions were prepared immediately prior to each experiment in either pbs or sterile distilled water  or deuterium oxide  and kept in the dark.

laser light
a  <dig> mw gallium-aluminum-arsenide  nir-laser  emitting light with a wavelength of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm was used for irradiation. for experimental purposes, the distance of the laser probe to the plate surface was adjusted to give fluence rates of  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  w cm- <dig> with an actual power output of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mw respectively.

effect of photosensitizer concentration on lethal photosensitization
aliquots  of a suspension of staph. aureus, strep. pyogenes  or p. aeruginosa  in sterile pbs were transferred into a 96-well plate and an equal volume of icg in pbs was added to each well to give final concentrations ranging from  <dig> μg ml- <dig> to  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  after addition of the icg, the wells were left in the dark for  <dig> or  <dig> minutes  and then exposed to a measured dose of high intensity laser light at a fluence rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig>  in this system, an exposure of  <dig> minutes corresponded to a light dose of  <dig> j cm- <dig>  each experimental condition was tested in at least triplicate and each experiment was carried out on at least two occasions. the conditions tested were; 1) controls which contained neither icg nor received irradiation , 2) incubation with icg in the dark , 3) irradiation in the absence of icg  and 4) the test which was irradiated in the presence of icg .

to enumerate the surviving bacteria, serial 10-fold dilutions were plated in duplicate either on blood agar  or nutrient agar .

effect of low intensity laser light
to avoid any heating effect that may occur during high intensity irradiation, the experiments were repeated using a laser power output of  <dig> mw to irradiate the samples at a low fluence rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig>  aliquots  of a suspension of staph. aureus or strep. pyogenes  in sterile pbs were transferred into a 96-well plate and an equal volume of icg in pbs was added to each well to give final concentration of  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  after addition of the icg, the wells were exposed to a measured dose of low intensity laser light for  <dig> or  <dig> minutes corresponding to light doses of  <dig> and  <dig> j cm- <dig> respectively. similar experiments were performed with p. aeruginosa except that the concentration of icg was  <dig> μg ml- <dig> and using a laser power output of  <dig> mw with a fluence rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig> for  <dig> minutes which corresponded to a light dose of  <dig> j cm- <dig> 

effect of laser light dose
the effect of laser light dose on bacterial killing was investigated by varying the exposure time whilst the distance from the light source remained constant. the bacterial suspensions were prepared as described above. a photosensitizer concentration of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> was used for photosensitizing the gram-positive organisms while  <dig> μg ml- <dig> was used for p. aeruginosa. survival was determined after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> minutes irradiation at a high fluence rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig> which corresponded to energy doses of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> j and energy densities of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> j cm- <dig> respectively.

effect of serum on the lethal photosensitization of staph. aureus
in order to investigate the lethal photosensitization of staph. aureus in an environment similar to that which would exist in a wound, lethal photosensitization experiments were performed in the presence of 50% horse serum . staph. aureus was suspended in hs  and icg  added at concentrations of  <dig> or  <dig> μg ml- <dig> . after addition of icg, samples of  <dig> μl were irradiated at a fluence rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig> and light dose of  <dig> j cm- <dig> 

effect of an enhancer of singlet oxygen life span on lethal photosensitization
to determine if singlet oxygen was involved in the lethal photosensitization process, d2o  was used to extend the life span of any singlet oxygen generated by exposure of icg to laser light. staph. aureus was suspended in d2o or h2o  and icg added to give a final concentration of  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  samples of  <dig> μl in triplicate wells were exposed to laser light for  <dig> minute at a fluence rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig>  control wells were also prepared and either were not exposed to light but received icg or did not receive icg and were not exposed to light or did not receive icg and were exposed to light.

effect of a free-radical and singlet oxygen scavenger on lethal photosensitization
staph. aureus was suspended in pbs  or different concentrations of l-tryptophan  dissolved in pbs and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h to detect any bactericidal activity of the scavenger itself. no bactericidal effect of the scavenger alone was detected. samples of  <dig> μl in triplicate wells containing staph. aureus and  <dig> μg ml- <dig> icg  in h2o  or the scavenger at a concentration of  <dig> mm were exposed to laser light for  <dig> minute at a fluence rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig>  control wells containing staph. aureus and  <dig> mm l-tryptophan were also prepared and either did not receive icg and were not exposed to light  or were not exposed to light but received icg  or did not receive icg and were exposed to light .

measurement of bacterial suspension temperature during lethal photosensitization and the effect of these temperatures on the viability of staph. aureus and p. aeruginosa
 <dig> μl of the bacterial suspension, with final concentrations of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μg ml- <dig> icg, were exposed to a measured dose of high intensity laser light for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> minutes  to determine the temperature elevation during lethal photosensitization. three additional wells contained the microbial suspension plus pbs instead of the photosensitizer were exposed to the same light doses to determine the rise of temperature in the absence of icg . the temperatures of the l+s- and l+s+ aliquots were recorded immediately before and after irradiation using an immersion thermocouple probe connected to a fluke  <dig> digital multimeter . the experiments were carried out in triplicate.

aliquots of staph. aureus either in sterile pbs or in hs  were added to an equal volume of icg to give a final concentration of  <dig> or  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  whereas p. aeruginosa suspension in pbs was added to icg to give a final concentration of  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  controls were prepared by adding an equal volume of pbs instead of icg. the staph. aureus suspensions were incubated either at 40°c  or 50°c  whereas p. aeruginosa was incubated at 50°c. all aliquots were incubated for  <dig> minutes in the dark. the survivors were enumerated by viable counting.

statistics
all experiments were performed twice and at least in triplicate except for lethal photosensitization experiments in horse serum with  <dig> μg ml- <dig> which were performed twice but in duplicate. values are expressed as means ± standard deviation. comparisons between means of groups were analyzed using the mann-whitney u test. p =  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
indocyanine green is an effective photosensitizer of wound-infecting organisms
when staph. aureus was treated with different concentrations of icg and exposed to  <dig> j cm- <dig> of high intensity nir light a significant reduction in the viable count was achieved even with the minimum concentration of icg used. for instance, when  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of icg was used there was a significant   <dig>  log <dig> reduction in the viable count of the suspension which contained  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> corresponds to  <dig> % efficacy. suspensions of staph. aureus treated with icg but not irradiated  showed a small  but significant  reduction in the viable count .

when strep. pyogenes was treated with different concentrations of icg and exposed to  <dig> j cm- <dig> of nir light, a significant  reduction in the viable count was achieved even with the lowest concentration of icg. treatment with  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of icg gave approximately a  <dig>  log <dig>  reduction in the viable count. this amounted to a kill of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  bacteria treated with icg but not irradiated , or those not treated with icg but irradiated with nir light did not show a significant reduction in viability .

when p. aeruginosa was treated with icg, the concentration used to obtain a significant kill with the gram-positive bacteria above was not sufficient to achieve killing upon irradiation. however, increasing the concentration of icg to  <dig> μg ml- <dig> gave a significant   <dig> log <dig>  reduction in the viable count on irradiation. this equated to killing of approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  interestingly, irradiation of p. aeruginosa with nir light in the absence of icg resulted in a significant  reduction in the viability of this organism  albeit not as great as that achieved in the presence of icg .

the effect of various dye concentrations
the bactericidal effect in all species was dependent on the icg concentration. figure  <dig> shows the log <dig> unit reduction in the viable count in the three micro-organisms when treated with different concentration of the ps and using a light dose of  <dig> j cm- <dig> at a fluence rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig>  the minimum effective concentration for killing the gram-positive organisms was  <dig> μg ml- <dig> whilst  <dig> μg ml- <dig> was needed to kill p. aeruginosa.

the effect of low intensity light
irradiation of staph. aureus in the presence of icg for  <dig> or  <dig> minutes with a low fluence rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig> achieved a significant  reduction of  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig> in the viable count respectively . using the same conditions, irradiation of strep. pyogenes resulted in significant  reductions of  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig> in the viable count respectively . for both gram positive-bacteria, kills amounting to  <dig>  and  <dig> % reductions in the viable count were achieved depending on the irradiation time. in the case of p. aeruginosa, a significant  reduction of  <dig>  log <dig>  in the viable count was achieved in the presence of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> icg which was irradiated for  <dig> minutes at a fluence rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig>  corresponding to a light dose of  <dig> j cm- <dig> 

amongst the three bacteria, only irradiation of p. aeruginosa with nir light in the absence of icg resulted in a significant   <dig>  log <dig>  reduction in the viability of this organism .

the effect of light dose
during high intensity irradiation, the bactericidal effect was dependent on the light dose delivered. significant  reductions of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  log <dig>  in the viable count of staph. aureus were achieved using exposure times of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes respectively. significant  log <dig> reductions in the viable count of strep. pyogenes were  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   using light doses of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes respectively. in the case of p. aeruginosa, lethal photosensitization using exposure times of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes achieved significant  kills of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig> corresponding to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % reductions in the viable count respectively. however, in the absence of icg, irradiation of p. aeruginosa also resulted in significant kills, with exposure times of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes achieving log <dig> reduction in the viable count of  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   respectively .

lethal photosensitization of staph. aureus in the presence of serum
in the presence of hs, lethal photosensitization of staph. aureus using a high fluence rate was significantly inhibited . lethal photosensitization using  <dig> μg ml- <dig> icg and an irradiation time of  <dig> minutes in 50% hs gave a significant   <dig>  log <dig> reduction in the viable count compared to a  <dig> log <dig> reduction in the absence of serum. however, increasing the concentration of icg to  <dig> μg ml- <dig> and exposure to the same light dose achieved a  <dig>  log <dig> reduction in the viable count in the presence of serum .

lethal photosensitization of staph. aureus in the presence of a singlet oxygen scavenger or enhancer
the singlet oxygen scavenger, l-tryptophan, significantly reduced the lethal photosensitization of staph. aureus . one log <dig> reduction in the number of staph. aureus killed was found in the presence of l-tryptophan over that in the absence of this scavenger . conversely, d2o considerably enhanced the killing of staph. aureus with a  <dig>  log <dig> greater reduction in viable counts compared to those achieved in the absence of d2o  .

temperature elevation during lethal photosensitization and its effect on the viability of bacteria
the temperature of the bacterial suspensions was elevated during high intensity lethal photosensitization with icg. the rises in temperature depended on the light dose delivered and the concentration of the photosensitizer. the temperature of the bacterial suspensions increased from 22°c to 37°c during irradiation with the highest light dose and a dye concentration of  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  whereas using  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of icg in either pbs or 50% hs, the temperature increased to a maximum of 47°c. no change in the viable count was observed after incubation of staph. aureus suspended in pbs, in the absence or presence of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> icg, and incubated for  <dig> minutes at 40°c in the dark. horse serum provided a protective effect for staph. aureus, a slight increase or no change in the viable count was noted after staph. aureus was suspended in pbs containing 50% hs in the absence or presence of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> icg and incubation for  <dig> minutes at 50°c. a statistically non-significant reduction was observed in the viable count of p. aeruginosa suspended in pbs, in the absence or presence of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> icg, and incubated for  <dig> minutes at 50°c. the viable count reduction was always less than  <dig>  log <dig> .

discussion
indocyanine green is a water-soluble anionic photosensitizer which is widely used in medical diagnosis. it is approved by the us fda for use in humans, in ophthalmology for retinal angiography as well as being used for diagnostic assessment of liver function and cardiac output and determining burn depth  <cit> . a number of in vitro and in vivo studies of the potential use of icg-mediated pdt have been carried out. in vitro researches reported an inhibitory effect of photoactivated icg on pancreatic cancer cells  <cit> , colonic cancer cells  <cit> , human  and mouse  melanoma cells  <cit> . these studies suggested that icg was a promising photosensitizer for clinical pdt but that further in vivo investigations were needed. several authors have investigated icg cyto-toxicity and photo-toxicity using in vitro,  <cit> , in vivo,  <cit>  and ex vivo models  <cit> . some of these have reported phototoxicity in eukaryotic cells which was dependent on pre-irradiation time, icg concentration, and light dose. abels et al.,  <dig> reported that icg phototoxicity depends on the pre-irradiation time  <cit> . after  <dig> h pre-irradiation time, no significant phototoxicity on hacat keratinocytes was detected using an icg concentration as high as  <dig> μm and light doses of  <dig> j/cm <dig> . phototoxicity of icg at concentrations of  <dig> μm was detected after  <dig> h pre-irradiation while a concentration as low as  <dig> μm was phototoxic after  <dig> h  <cit> . however, in the current study the pre-irradiation time was no more than  <dig> minutes which implies that keratinocyte phototoxicity would not be a problem under these conditions.

in humans, icg-mediated pdt has been used in the treatment of acne vulgaris  <cit> . a recent pilot study was carried out by tuchin et al,  on the effects of icg photodynamic and photothermolysis treatment on acne vulgaris. in this study, the authors used a very high concentration of icg , a pre-irradiation time of  <dig> or  <dig> minutes and very high light dose and fluence rates of nir laser-diode light . for soft acne treatment, the low intensity  or the medium-intensity  protocols were used. single and multiple  treatments were studied. the individual acne lesions were photothermally treated at  <dig> w/cm <dig>  without skin surface cooling or at  <dig> w/cm <dig>  with cooling. as no adverse effects were reported, the investigators concluded that such high light intensities and icg concentrations were safe for use in humans  <cit> .

the purpose of this study was to investigate whether icg in combination with light from a nir laser is effective at killing common wound-infecting organisms and to determine the fluence rates needed to photosensitize wound-infecting organisms. the results of the study have shown that all three organisms tested are susceptible to lethal photosensitization using icg as a photosensitizer in combination with  <dig> nm light using both high and low fluence rates. at high fluence rates the gram-negative bacterium p. aeruginosa showed no resistance to lethal photosensitization with icg in the presence of high concentrations of the photosensitizer. however at the low fluence rate p. aerusginosa did show resistance to the lethal photosensitization process while the gram-positive organisms  were not resistant. the lethal photosensitization of these wound-infecting organisms with icg was dependent on the light dose and icg concentration.

the differing susceptibilities of the gram-negative and gram-positive organisms to lethal photosensitization in this study are probably attributable to differences in cell wall structures. gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that may reduce the uptake of reactive oxygen species by the bacterium  <cit> . in addition the presence of lipopolysaccharide  in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria acts as a very effective permeability barrier to many of the molecules in the external environment and contributes to the development of drug-resistance in these organisms  <cit> . in contrast, gram-positive bacteria have a porous outer layer of peptidoglycan which is a less effective permeability barrier  <cit> . gram-negative bacteria are known to be relatively impermeable to neutral or anionic drugs and icg is an anionic dye  <cit> .

interestingly, both high and low intensity  <dig> nm light alone was able to exert a cidal effect against p. aeruginosa. this killing effect was not heat mediated as the temperature of the bacterial suspensions did not exceed 33°c during irradiation. this finding is supported by the results of a previous study in which irradiation of the organism with 1– <dig> j cm- <dig> laser light at a wavelength of  <dig> nm and using an irradiance rate of  <dig>  w cm- <dig> resulted in a significant inhibition of bacterial growth  <cit> . a possible explanation for this observation is that p. aeruginosa has endogenous pigments  that may absorb the light and result in the production of bactericidal species  <cit> . the current data suggest that nir laser light irradiation by itself would also inhibit growth of p. aeruginosa in infected wounds.

a prerequisite for successful antimicrobial pdt to treat wound infection is its efficiency in the presence of wound fluid. to more closely mimic the conditions likely to be experienced in vivo, we investigated the effect of serum on the lethal photosensitization of staph. aureus. horse serum reduced the effectiveness of lethal photosensitization with icg possibly because serum proteins in the environment bind to the icg thereby preventing its uptake by the organism  <cit>  or else they may act as quenchers of the singlet oxygen produced thereby protecting the bacterial cells from their lethal effects  <cit> . however, increasing the concentration of icg overcame the inhibitory effect of serum suggesting that killing of the organism may be achievable in vivo. our findings were confirmed by the results of lambrechts et al. which showed that albumin inhibited the photodynamic inactivation  of staph. aureus and exerted a dose dependent protective effect against the pdi of the microorganism which was dependent on the albumin content of the suspending fluid  <cit> .

to reveal something of the underlying mechanisms involved in killing of the wound-infecting organisms by icg, lethal photosensitization experiments were carried out in the presence of an enhancer of 1o <dig> life span  or a quencher of 1o <dig>   <cit> . the augmentation of staph. aureus killing in the presence of d2o demonstrated that enhancement of the life span of 1o <dig> increases the bactericidal effect thereby suggesting the involvement of this cytotoxic species in the lethal photosensitization process. further evidence of the involvement of singlet oxygen is provided by the protective effect of the singlet oxygen scavenger, tryptophan.

however during the lethal photosensitization experiments at high fluence rate and the highest concentration of icg , the temperature of the bacterial suspensions increased to 47°c, whereas at lower concentrations the temperature did not exceed 42°c. according to the literature, temperatures of a few degrees above the physiological norm, i.e., 42–45°c can induce cell apoptosis. however, as normal tissues approach this temperature, intrinsic heat dissipation occurs  so that temperatures up to 45°c could be tolerated by the tissues  <cit> . more prolonged heating can be associated with secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells, where the cells retained some of the features of apoptosis but had superimposed features of necrosis including membrane disintegration and swelling of cytoplasmic organelles. after a few days, apoptotic cells are phagocytosed by tissue mononuclear phagocytes. temperatures greater than 45°c  cause prolonged necrosis, uniformly affecting all cells in tissue structure  <cit> . it also should be noted that heating has some synergic effect when applied together with pdt  <cit> ; therefore more effective bacterial killing can be achieved. in clinical practice, providing an effective cooling system for the skin surface  <cit>  or else the use of a pulsed laser may avoid tissue necrosis.

in order to ascertain whether this temperature rise was responsible for the kills achieved, the test organisms were exposed to a slightly higher temperature than that which occurred during lethal photosensitization and for longer periods of time. as exposure to these temperatures resulted in no, or only slight, reductions in bacterial viability, it can be concluded that the observed kills were attributable to the light-induced generation of singlet oxygen  rather than to thermal effects. even though the temperature of staph. aureus suspensions containing  <dig> μg ml- <dig> icg increased up to 47°c, there was no significant reduction in the viable count of staph. aureus in 50% hs at a similar temperature . it may be that protein molecules in the serum provide protection against the heating effect. this observation suggests that killing of staph. aureus was more likely attributable to the products of lethal photosensitization. in addition, irradiating the bacteria with low fluence rates of  <dig>  or  <dig>  w cm- <dig> resulted in significant reduction in the viability of the three bacteria. these results support the hypothesis that the cytotoxic species produced from the photosensitization process are responsible for bacterial kill.

the notion of disinfecting burns and wounds using a noninvasive and localized strategy such as pdt with limited damage to the host tissue is well documented in the literature  <cit> . lambrechts et al achieved  <dig>  or  <dig>  log <dig> units reduction in the viability of staph. aureus using  <dig> nm light with a light dose of  <dig>  or  <dig>  j cm- <dig> and  <dig>  μm 5-phenyl- <dig> ,20-tris porphyrin chloride   <cit> . taking into account the variation in experimental design, we achieved a  <dig>  log <dig> unit reduction in the viability of staph. aureus using  <dig> μg ml- <dig> icg  and a light dose of  <dig> j cm- <dig> from a coherent light source  which allows deeper tissue penetration than the light source  used in the above mentioned study. in another study, orenstein et al. used a mixture of deuteroporphyrin and hemin which successfully disinfected burns infected with staph. aureus even in the dark without illumination  <cit> . in contrast, the icg used in the current study had minimal dark toxicity against the organisms tested. icg is a comparatively weak photosensitizer because the yields of the triplet state appear low compared with other photosensitizers used in pdt  <cit> . nevertheless, the data obtained in this study have shown that significant kills of staph. aureus and strep. pyogenes can be achieved using a low concentration of the photosensitizer of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> and a low light dose of  <dig> j cm- <dig>  the gram-negative organism, p. aeruginosa, appeared to be less susceptible as higher icg concentrations and higher light doses were needed to achieve substantial kills. interestingly, however, appreciable kills of the organism were attained by irradiation in the absence of the icg. it is well established that humans can tolerate systemic icg concentrations in the mg/ml range i.e. 5-fold greater than those used in this study.

the phototherapeutic window of many pss effective against bacteria is 600– <dig> nm  <cit> . the most frequently studied pss are activated by light wavelengths between  <dig> – <dig> nm  <cit> . however, light of such wavelengths has limited tissue penetration compared to light with a wavelength of  <dig> nm  <cit>  which we used to activate icg in the present study. in fact, the depth of penetration doubles from  <dig> mm at 500– <dig> nm to  <dig> mm at  <dig> nm  <cit> . this may enable killing of bacteria within deeper wounds and burns. in addition, icg is of very low toxicity and is rapidly excreted from the body so that any possible damage to host tissue would be limited.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the results of the present study suggest that indocyanine green in combination with near-infrared light is a promising candidate for the photodynamic therapy of burn and wound infections. furthermore, the nir laser light itself may be able to disinfect wounds contaminated with p. aeruginosa. use of this approach would reduce the requirements for systemic antibiotics in the management of skin infections and thereby help to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance. although the results of these in vitro studies are promising, in vivo studies are needed to ascertain whether appreciable bacterial kills can be obtained in a wound model.
