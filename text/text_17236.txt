BACKGROUND
due to its high sensitivity and specificity, fluorescence analysis has been extensively used in microarray technology  <cit> , gene expression monitoring  <cit> , protein diffusion  <cit>  or in vivo chemical elements uptake and localization studies  <cit> . another area to benefit from fluorescence based techniques is protein quantification. the use of either non-covalent  <cit>  or covalent labelling  <cit>  increased the detection sensitivity to as low as  <dig> ng/ml.

cellulose-binding domains  are modules present in most celulases, being responsible for their high affinity to cellulose crystalline surfaces  <cit> . the cbd used in this work, produced by limited proteolysis, belongs to cellobiohydrolase i  of trichoderma reesei, as shown in a previous work  <cit> . three tyrosine residues define a flat surface, which may be responsible for the affinity to cellulose  <cit> . this protein has a single amine, the n-terminal of the linker region, which allows a specific reaction with fluorescein isothiocyanate . the conjugation with fitc does not affect the cbd interaction with cellulose, since the n-terminal is isolated from the cellulose interacting part of the protein. indeed, the conjugation of fitc does not modify the cbd adsorption isotherms  <cit> . since there is only one amine group present in the cbd, the stoichiometry of the conjugation reaction is 1: <dig>  the fitc fluorophore has been attached to antibodies  <cit> , to microparticles  <cit>  or to other binding domains  <cit> . several recombinant cbds, fused to different proteins, have been produced, as recently reviewed by shoseyov et al. <cit> .

cellulose-binding domains  have been used to target functional molecules to cellulose-containing materials  <cit> , to improve pulp properties  <cit>  or as an additive for paper recycling  <cit> . bearing in mind that these applications are related to surface effects, in this work we attempted to quantify the cbd surface coverage of cellulose fibres, using the approach based on the use of cbd-fitc previously developed. our aim was to quantify the protein adsorbed on cellulose fibres and, more specifically, the surface concentration of cbd. this value could, alternatively, be estimated by measuring the specific surface area, by means of the bet isotherm  <cit> . however, the bet approach is not ideal for porous materials  <cit> . the presence of cbds in the interior of the fibres was also investigated.

RESULTS
in a previous work  <cit> , we have shown that cbds affect the technical properties of paper fibres . the concentration of cbds, used in those experiments, was in the range of 1– <dig> mg of cbd per gram of fibres. it is arguable whether this relatively low amount of protein is sufficient to cause modifications in the fibres' interfacial properties. this would probably imply a substantial coating of the fibres by cbds. in this work, we analyzed fibres from portucel treated with cbds conjugated to fitc, and attempted to estimate the percentage of surface coverage. fibres treated with only cbds didn't present any fluorescence. as may be observed in figure  <dig>  the fibres do not display a uniform distribution of fluorescence. this may be due to the chemical heterogeneity  and/or to the variable crystallinity  <cit> . the regions with less intense fluorescence in the picture were selected for cbd-fitc quantification, since these regions are expected to be more crystalline . the detected fluorescence is produced by cbds adsorbed on both sides of the fibres . indeed, the fluorescent radiation crosses the fibres with just a slight reduction in intensity  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a whatman cf <dig> fibre, both on bright field and fluorescence microscopy. as it can be observed in the circled area, this cellulose has a rather smooth surface. the extremities of the fibres are expected to have a higher number of fissures and loosen microfibrils, increasing the available area, and consequently the adsorbing sites for cbds  <cit> , as indicated by the higher fluorescence emission . the adsorption of cbds on whatman cf <dig> fibres was analyzed, using a protein concentration of  <dig> mg/gfibres. the estimated surface concentrations of cbds adsorbed on portucel and whatman cf <dig> fibres  are shown in figure  <dig> 

in another experiment, whatman cf <dig>  amorphous cellulose and sigmacell  <dig> fibres were allowed to adsorb cbds from a much more concentrated cbd solution , corresponding to  <dig> mg/gfibres . this concentration is expected to saturate the fibres according to the adsorption isotherm.

considering the size  <cit>  of a cellobiohydrolase i cbd , the density of a cbd monolayer corresponds to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> mol/mm <dig>  it is also considered that the fluorescent signal is produced by cbds adsorbed on the two sides of the fibres' external surface. indeed, the accessible area may be much larger than the one corresponding to a flat, impenetrable fibre. therefore, an estimate of about  <dig> layers of cbds adsorbed in the whatman cf <dig> surface results from this reasoning, when the larger concentration of cbds is used; for a lower cbd concentration, a surface coverage of 77% and 110% is estimated, respectively, for portucel and whatman fibres , dividing the calculated surface concentration by the theoretical monolayer of cbds. this is much higher than the expected maximum of one layer of adsorbed cbd, at saturation. although the surface is apparently smooth, the fibres may have irregularities, such as microfissures or holes created by cbds  <cit> . the presence of more or less loose microfibrils, large pores or fissures may substantially increase the surface area and the amount of bound proteins, thus leading to a higher fluorescence emission than the theorized monolayer. indeed, confocal microscopy reveals that the surface has many irregularities , while the inner region presents a homogeneous structure . another important observation provided by confocal microscopy was that fluorescence in the inner core of the fibres was always superior to the background intensity , indicating that cbds may have penetrated into the fibre. as a matter of fact, as shown in figure 5-d, fluorescent material  was detected at all depths of the fibre. this observation is supported by immunolabelling of cbd-treated cf <dig> fibres . this analysis revealed the presence of cbds  in the interior of the fibre. considering this, we may now explain that the surface concentration of cbds in figure  <dig> arises from the cbds penetration deep inside the fibres. another aspect to take into account is that cbds may not adsorb as a single and well ordered monolayer, but rather as agglomerates  <cit> , thereby increasing the average fluorescence per unit area. nevertheless, it is quite probable that the cbd coating of the external surface is rather significant.

amorphous cellulose was prepared, by treating whatman cf <dig> with phosphoric acid, which induces the swelling of fibres. as it can be seen in figure  <dig>  the fibres are larger than the original ones . this swelling effect is due to the disruption or loosening of the microfibrils, thus increasing the volume occupied by the total fibre. as a result, the total surface area available for cbd adsorption increases. consequently, it is expected that the measured cbd fluorescence would be higher than the one obtained for cf <dig> fibres, mostly due to an easier penetration of cbd into the fibres structure. this was confirmed, as can be seen in figure  <dig>  the surface coverage increases about 50% . this result can arise either from increased cbd affinity for the more amorphous fibres, or to easier penetration, and hence higher concentration in the fibres. due to the higher fluorescence obtained with these fibres, the majority of the image exceeded the maximum concentration used in the calibration and it had to be excluded in the image analysis .

sigmacell  <dig> is obtained by the separation of crushed cellulose fibres, with an average size of  <dig> μm. this mechanical treatment expectedly leads to broken ends or loosen fibrils . then, the adsorption of cbd is expected to be higher than with cf <dig> and comparable to the amorphous cellulose . again, the fibres present a high fluorescence emission corresponding to a high amount of adsorbed cbd: about  <dig> layers.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, the surface concentration of cbd adsorbed on cellulose fibres was estimated. the coating values obtained were higher than expected, corresponding in theory to several layers  of cbds adsorbed on the external surface. however, it has been demonstrated that the cbds penetrate the fibres. an important amount of cbds was detected inside the fibres by immunolabelling and confocal microscopy. it seems that a large fraction of the adsorbed cbds actually penetrate the fibres. the surface coverage values are, undoubtedly, high enough to justify a change in the fibres' surface properties. cbds may therefore be used as powerful tools to modulate the fibres' surface properties.
