BACKGROUND
eukaryotic chromosomes are replicated from multiple replication origins. in budding yeast, replication origins are termed ars  and contain the ars consensus sequence , which is essential for origin activity  <cit> . during the g <dig> phase, pre-replicative complexes , composed of the origin recognition complex , cdc <dig>  cdt <dig>  and an inactive form of the replicative helicase mcm2- <dig> complex are assembled into acs-containing origin regions, a process called ‘licensing’  <cit> . during s phase, origin activation is induced by the activation of the mcm2- <dig> helicase and by the recruitment of further initiation factors, including mcm <dig>  cdc <dig>  gins, sld <dig>  sld <dig> and dpb <dig>  to form pre-initiation complexes   <cit> . although all replication origins are ‘licensed’ during g <dig> phase  <cit> , not all of them are activated during the subsequent replication cycle and, moreover, origins are activated at different times along s phase. the temporal order of origin activation is called the replication timing program, and it is established in g <dig> phase  <cit> .

the mechanisms orchestrating the timing program are not fully understood, but many studies have indicated that the firing of origins can be influenced by different factors involving replication initiation mechanisms, epigenetic modifications, chromosomal position and the chromatin context .

limiting levels of initiation factors have been reported  <cit> , and constitute a point of control of replication initiation. the amount of sld <dig>  sld <dig>  sld <dig>  dpb <dig>  cdc <dig> and dbf <dig> factors is below the number of “licensed” origins, and hence activation is necessarily restricted to a subset of origins. some of these factors, i.e. sld <dig> and cdc <dig>  can be detected specifically at some early firing origins during g <dig>  <cit> , which is critical for promoting their activation at the beginning of s phase. however, even though the sequential activation of origins can be explained by limiting levels of essential initiation proteins, an open question is why limiting factors are preferentially recruited by early origins.

recent reports have indicated that the forkhead transcription factors fkh <dig> and fkh <dig> are involved in early origin firing  <cit> . although fkh <dig> and fkh <dig> are not required for origin licensing, the binding of cdc <dig> to early origins in g <dig> seems to be fkh1/2-dependent, and it has been suggested that the role of fkh1/ <dig> in origin firing would involve the establishment of replication timing domains and the spatial organization of origins  <cit> . fkh1/ <dig> binding sites are enriched in a subset of origins, but chip–chip analyses indicate that there is no strict correlation between the presence of consensus motifs and fkh1/ <dig> binding  <cit> . in addition, the presence of fkh1/ <dig> binding sites is not sufficient to confer early firing, and the number and distribution of fkh motifs within the origin region seem to be important for conferring early origin activation  <cit> , arguing for an additional role of the chromatin environment in the regulation of origin firing.

chromatin modifications also play a role in the regulation of origin timing and several studies have demonstrated that increases in histone acetylation, either by deletion of the deacetylase rpd <dig> or by artificial recruitment of the histone acetylase gcn <dig>  correlate with advanced origin firing  <cit> . however, the explanation as to how histone acetylation modifies replication timing has remained obscure.

previous studies have shown that replication origins in budding yeast exhibit a specific nucleosomal configuration, consisting of a nucleosome-depleted region  next to the acs element, flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes  <cit> . the correct organization of these origin-associated chromatin features is important for efficient replication initiation  <cit>  and it would also be important for the timing of origin activation.

in light of the above, here we examined the contribution of the chromatin structure to the timing of origin firing by genome-wide analysis of the nucleosome organization at early and late origins and its relationship with epigenetic modifications, in particular with histone acetylation. our findings show that early and late origins exhibit different nucleosomal patterns, which are influenced by the genomic context. we found that higher histone acetylation in rpd <dig> mutants was linked to local changes in chromatin structure, leading to a more open conformation at the affected replication origins. finally, our analysis indicates that origin structure is dynamic during the cell cycle.

RESULTS
early and late replication origins exhibit different nucleosome profiles
to study the interplay between chromatin organization and replication timing, we generated high-resolution maps of nucleosome positions of the entire genome of s. cerevisae . previous experiments indicate that origin timing is established in early g <dig> phase  <cit>  and we therefore determined the nucleosomal profile of replication origins from g1-synchronized cells . given the importance of aligning nucleosome maps relative to acs to uncover chromatin structure in origins  <cit> , we selected a subset of  <dig> origins with previously annotated acs  <cit>  . as shown in figure 1a , the average nucleosome profile of replication origins is characterized by the presence of an ndr that covers the acs element asymmetrically, flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes at both sides, as previously reported  <cit> . however, a diversity of chromatin structures in replication origins has been reported  <cit> , and to identify variations in their nucleosomal patterns we performed a k-means clustering analysis to classify origins by their similarities in the ndr width and degree of occupancy of the flanking nucleosomes. following those criteria, six origin groups with relatively distinct patterns of nucleosome distribution were chosen  . from classes  <dig> to  <dig>  the ndr width diminished from  <dig> to 129 bp as did the positioning and occupancy of the nucleosomes located at adjacent positions .figure  <dig>

since replication origins displayed different types of nucleosomal configuration as well as a different timing of activation, we wondered whether early and late origins might be preferentially linked to some of the nucleosome profiles identified above. first, we independently aligned nucleosome maps corresponding to early and late origins groups relative to the acs. the assignment of replication origins within early or late categories for our analysis was made according to timing data available from at least three independent studies . comparison of their average nucleosome profiles showed that early origins displayed a higher occupancy of nucleosomes immediately upstream  and downstream  from a broader ndr feature, along with a better positioning of the adjacent nucleosomes .

second, we examined the nucleosomal arrangement of early and late replication origins within the six types of nucleosome patterns described above. although the  <dig> different classes of origin organization were found within early and late origin groups , quantification of the distribution of early and late origins between the different classes revealed a marked preferential distribution of early origins for classes  <dig> and  <dig> and of late origins for classes  <dig> and  <dig> . indeed, 60% of early origins belonged to classes  <dig> and  <dig>  while 65% of late origins belonged to classes  <dig> and  <dig>  moreover, nearly 40% of early or late origins were clustered in class  <dig> or  <dig> respectively . the overlap between the profiles of classes  <dig> and  <dig>  which include the highest proportion of early and late origins, shows a striking difference in chromatin architecture between them .

next, we wondered whether early and late origins, or their different chromatin structure, could be influenced by the genomic context in which origins are placed. in s. cerevisiae, replication origins are mainly located at intergenic regions , which may be flanked by genes transcribed co-directionally, convergently or divergently. replication origins in budding yeast appeared in these three types of igr, but when we quantified the number of early and late origins located in each type of igr, we found that they were not randomly distributed between them. in fact, while early origins can be found in all types of igr with nearly the expected probability, late origins showed a strong bias for convergent igr .

we asked whether this preferential localization would be related to their different chromatin architecture. to address this question we quantified the number of c1&2-early and c5&6-late origins located in each type of igr, and we found that 60% of origins in each group mapped to igr between tandem and convergent transcripts, respectively . moreover, class  <dig> was particularly enriched in convergent igr, and the percentage of c6-late origins at this type of igrs reached 71%. our results indicated that class  <dig> was linked to this type of gene organization , and class  <dig> is highly enriched with late origins, therefore late origins are necessarily over-represented at convergent igr. origin-free ndr in convergent igr were on average shorter and presented lower nucleosome occupancy than ndr located in igr with gene units organized in tandem or divergently , resembling class 6-origin patterns. this might suggest that igr with convergent transcription are prone to have lower nucleosome occupancy and shorter ndr.

in sum, although a nucleosome-depleted region next to the acs element flanked by positioned nucleosomes is a common feature shared by all origins, the above analysis identified previously unknown separate modes of nucleosome organization in early and late replication origins. in addition, these early and late-nucleosomal patterns were preferentially located in different kinds of intergenic regions, which might condition their different chromatin structure and timing.

fkh-binding sites co-localize with the ndr in early origins
next, we investigated the relationship between factors involved in replication timing and chromatin organization. a role of fkh1/ <dig> transcription factors in early origin firing has been described  <cit> . however, although fkh1/2-binding sites are widespread throughout the genome and are frequently found in origins, only fkh1/ <dig> consensus sites placed in very close proximity to acss confer early origin activation  <cit> . in fact, it has been recently reported that some early origins present two fkh1/2-binding sites separated not less than 60 bp and not more than 120 bp  <cit> , although the reason behind that is unknown. we argued that the distribution of fkh1/ <dig> motifs might be related to origin architecture.to examine this possibility, we inspected the location of fkh1/2-binding sites in replication origins in the context of chromatin organization. thus, we searched for the fkh-binding sequence throughout the genome and plotted the average enrichment of the fkh motif in early or late origin clusters  within the framework of their nucleosome profiles . figure  <dig> shows that the fkh-binding sequence was highly represented only in early origins, as expected. in addition, our analysis indicated that there were two preferential fkh-binding sites at early origins, and remarkably, both sites showed a precise co-localization with the ndr. these two forkhead sites are located at each border of the ndr; the best represented is located in close proximity to acs, while the other one is on average 80–100 bp apart, beyond a middle ndr region where fkh sites are excluded.figure  <dig> 
fkh-binding sites are enriched in the ndr of early origins. aggregated nucleosomal profiles  and fkh-motif density  were aligned relative to the acs of early  and late  replication origins.



these results advance our previous knowledge by showing that fhk1/ <dig> motifs are often positioned at the boundaries of the ndr, which could explain why critical fkh1/ <dig> motifs are restricted to the close vicinity of acs and why they are not further apart than 120 bp. therefore, the localization and distribution of fkh1/ <dig> motifs required for early origin function might be imposed or determined by the ndr element.

these data also suggest that the location of fkh motifs within accessible chromatin is important for early origin firing. it would be possible that the higher accessibility of fkh1/ <dig> motifs located within the ndr may favour the binding of fkh1/ <dig> factors, or/and the interaction between fkh and replication factors such as cdc <dig> in early origins  <cit> . however, not all early origins contain fkh-binding sites, and only  <dig> % of the early origins considered in our analysis had this specific configuration of  <dig> fkh sites close to the acs, indicating that other factors must influence early firing too.

an increase in histone acetylation correlates with local nucleosomal remodelling in rpd3mutants
histone modifications also play a role in determining origin timing, and an increase in histone acetylation around origins induces earlier firing  <cit> . our data revealed a correlation between origin structure and replication timing and we therefore wondered whether histone acetylation might modify replication timing by altering the chromatin architecture of replication origins. to examine this possibility, we generated genome-wide nucleosome maps in an rpd3Δ mutant, where the rpd <dig> histone deacetylase gen had been deleted.

despite rpd <dig> playing a key role in the global deacetylation of the two core histones h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> , our maps showed that the general pattern of nucleosome distribution was mostly unaltered in the absence of rpd <dig> . in fact, the average nucleosome organization of genes relative to the + <dig> nucleosome or relative to the transcription start site  was very similar in the wild-type and rpd3Δ mutant strains . however, the analysis of individual genomic regions showed that although most nucleosomes occupied the same positions in both strains, some differences were observed at specific nucleosomes , as in the case of the acid phosphatase pho <dig> locus. deletion of rpd <dig> increases the expression of the pho <dig> gene and involves deacetylation along a  <dig> -kb region that includes pho5
 <cit> . however, chromatin remodelling in the absence of rpd <dig> was restricted to a few nucleosomes surrounding an ndr located upstream from the 5′ end of the gene . this observation indicated that histone deacetylation results in local modifications of nucleosome organization in key regulatory elements, which seem to have a great impact on transcriptional regulation, and perhaps also on replication timing.figure  <dig>

deletion of the deacetylase rpd3increases origin accessibility
to explore the above possibility, we wondered whether chromatin structure in origin regions would also be modified locally in an rpd3-dependent manner. analysis of the average nucleosomal organization of replication origins from g1-synchronized cells showed that origins presented a ndr flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes in rpd3Δ cells too and, also, that early and late origins displayed different nucleosome profiles when analyzed separately . this result indicated that the different profiles observed at early and late origins were rpd3-independent.

however, when we compared the nucleosome profile of replication origins between the wild-type and rpd3Δ strains, we observed that the chromatin structure of origins was affected in the absence of rpd <dig> in g <dig> , but not in s-phase . thus, rpd <dig> mutants had a wider ndr and lower occupancy of the - <dig> and + <dig> nucleosomes. importantly, the average nucleosome pattern in ndr that did not colocalize with origins revealed no significant changes between the two strains , indicating that the observed rpd3-dependent remodelling was origin-specific. to estimate the extent of the differences in the ndr length between wild-type and rpd3Δ strains, we measured the width of the ndr of replication origins individually and plotted the average length for each strain. figure 4c shows that the ndr size increased in rpd3Δ mutants in origins, but not in the control group .figure  <dig>

to discriminate whether the g1-specific nucleosomal remodelling observed was affecting early or late replication origins or both, we analyzed the average nucleosome profiles of early and late origin groups independently. figure 4d-e shows that chromatin structure was remodelled in both types of origins, although changes in the ndr width and occupancy in late origins were slightly more pronounced. according to this, the ndr size increased in rpd3Δ mutants in both early and late origins . local modifications in the ndr region also included the aperture of an ndr that was occupied by a nucleosome in a wild-type strain. this ndr “opening” was taken place in the absence of rpd <dig> in 21% of early and  <dig> % of late origins with these characteristics, and an example is shown in additional file 4: figure s3d for ars <dig> 

chromatin remodelling in the de-acetylation mutant also affected the occupancy of nucleosomes flanking the ndr. these local modifications were examined in individual origin regions in the absence of rpd <dig>  and some origins such as ars <dig> and ars <dig> showed a noticeable decrease in occupancy in the + <dig> nucleosome  while in others like ars <dig> the nucleosomes - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were also affected . when acetylation data were available  <cit>  for the origin analyzed, we found that the chromatin-remodelled region was hyper-acetylated .

our data indicate that rpd <dig> affects the nucleosomal configuration of many early and late origins. similarly, rpd <dig> affects the replication timing of numerous origins, including early and late ones  <cit> . we confirmed that origin replication timing was altered in our rpd3Δ sample by examining origin activation of the early origin ars <dig> and the late origin ars <dig> during s phase as described in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  thus, 2d gel analysis indicated that when rpd <dig> was deleted the bubble arc for ars <dig> was most prominent at 30 min, whereas in the wild-type strain the maximum was observed at 45 min . in addition, we examined the position of the replication forks by monitoring the association of the replication protein a , a single-strand dna-binding protein that has been shown to match the location of the replisome  <cit> . chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments showed that the association of rpa <dig> peaked at 5 kb away from ars <dig> in rpd3Δ cells while in wild-type cells rpa1-association was restricted to the origin position . since origin efficiency seems comparable in both strains, we concluded that ars <dig> fires earlier in the mutant strain and therefore that more dna will be synthesized before dntp levels are depleted by hu. these data are in agreement with previous observations showing that the firing of ars <dig> is advanced in rpd <dig> mutants  <cit> . when we examined the activation of ars <dig> we detected initiation structures , indicating that in rpd3Δ mutants late origins can escape checkpoint inhibition to a certain extent, as described  <cit> . however, the lower bubble arc signal in ars <dig>  suggested that late origin firing before critical dntp depletion was taking place in a small proportion of cells. therefore, replication timing was altered in rpd <dig> mutants, and so was the nucleosomal organization around origin regions.

then we took the opposite approach, and we analyzed the nucleosome profile of a described set of origins  with advanced replication in the absence of rpd <dig>  <cit> . additional file 4: figure s3c showed similar variations in the ndr-width and occupancy of flanking nucleosomes as described in figures 4a-d-e. these results strongly suggest that nucleosome remodelling in rpd <dig> mutants is related with changes in replication timing.

taken together, our results indicate that there is a correlation between changes in histone acetylation and replication timing with local modifications in origin architecture. despite the fact that early and late specific chromatin patterns are conserved in rpd3Δ mutants, the remodelling of key origin features such as the ndr and - <dig> /+ <dig> nucleosomes leads to a more open conformation. although it has been speculated that changes in histone acetylation can influence replication timing by modifying chromatin structure  <cit> , our results demonstrate for the first time that higher levels of histone acetylation caused by the deletion of the deacetylase rpd <dig> increase ndr opening.

origin architecture is dynamic during activation
as mentioned in the introduction, origin activation involves the modification of chromatin-bound replicative complexes and we wondered whether this process might entail modifications in origin structure during s phase. to explore this possibility, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the dynamics of chromatin organization at replication origins before and after origin activation by comparing the nucleosomal pattern of synchronized populations in g <dig> and cells proceeding into s-phase in the presence of hydroxyurea . the slow movement of replication forks in the presence of hu facilitates the analysis of replication dynamics and nucleosome organization during s-phase. additionally, late origin firing is inhibited in the presence of hu by the replication checkpoint  <cit> , providing a system to compare chromatin organization in active or inactive origins within the same replication cycle.

the analysis of nucleosome distribution in g <dig> and s-phase samples revealed that the majority of nucleosomes seem to occupy the same positions before and after replication initiation . we noted that in early origin regions, and not in late ones, the average nucleosome signal was substantially higher during s phase . when the differential between the nucleosomal signals from the s and g <dig> samples was represented  a major s-phase signal coinciding with early origin regions was corroborated . higher nucleosome signals would be expected at those regions due to an increase in dna copy number after replication from early origins. in fact, analysis of the ars <dig> region indicated that a major s-g <dig> differential signal extended for 2– <dig>  kilobases on either side of the origin , coinciding with the previously described length of replication intermediates accumulated at hu-blocked replication forks  <cit> . indeed, when nucleosome signals were corrected for copy number , the g <dig> and s-phase signals in early origin positions became similar, while late origins regions remained unchanged . therefore, the location and extent of a region with elevated nucleosome signals in s-phase relative to g <dig> mark out origin activation and newly replicated chromatin, and hence nucleosome mapping by deep sequencing is a suitable approach for analyzing both chromatin and replication dynamics at genomic scale.however, a careful comparison of the average nucleosome configuration in replication origins regions revealed that origin structure changed from g <dig> to s phase, and remarkably, different changes were observed in early and late origin groups . in early origins, + <dig>  + <dig> and + <dig> nucleosomes were shifted to the left in s-phase cells  compared to g <dig> cells  . by contrast, in late origins, the ndr print was wider in the s-phase sample and, in this case, a clear reduction in occupancy of the - <dig> and + <dig> nucleosomes was also observed .this nucleosome rearrangement was also detected in individual examples such as the early origins, ars <dig> and ars <dig>  and late origins, ars <dig> and ars <dig> . the high resolution achieved in our nucleosome maps was able to detect modifications at individual nucleosome positions and, in fact, early origins showed a clear displacement of the first nucleosomes opposite to the acs towards the inner part of the ndr during s-phase , while the rest were maintained at the same positions as in g <dig>  by contrast, although changes in nucleosome positions were also restricted to the vicinity of the acs in late origins, nucleosome displacement was directed outside the ndr and the occupancy of + <dig> nucleosome was drastically reduced in late origins such as ars <dig> .figure  <dig>

the above observations revealed that the structure of the ndr is dynamic during replication but we then wondered why ndr-modulation would be different at early and late origins during s phase. we reasoned that the observed changes might be linked to origin activation, which in hu should take place exclusively at early origins. to confirm the unique activation of early origins in our experimental conditions, we performed 2d gel analysis of dna replication intermediates on ars <dig> and ars <dig> as previously described  <cit> . in ars <dig>  the replication bubble arc indicated origin activation . by contrast, when the membranes were re-probed to analyze ars <dig> activation, no initiation structures at this late origin were observed. therefore, one possibility was that the ndr-conformation would be different in origins before and after origin firing .

one prediction of this hypothesis is that the ndr would be modulated at replication origins at their time of origin firing. to test this possibility, we compared the nucleosome organization of the ars <dig> region before and after origin activation during an unperturbed s phase  by micrococcal nuclease  analysis. in this experiment, g1-synchronized cells were released into s phase, and different samples were taken from  <dig> to 80 minutes . in each sample, chromatin was digested with increasing amounts of mnase, followed by digestion with an appropriate restriction enzyme and southern hybridization with a terminal probe. the results shown in figure  <dig> indicated that the ndr region colocalized with two mnase-hypersensitive sites flanking a protected middle region and, importantly, the lower mnase site was reduced in intensity  while the upper mnase-hypersensitive zone was expanded  from 40 minutes onwards, coinciding with the activation time of late origins .figure  <dig>

we conclude that origin nucleosomal configuration is dynamic during the cell cycle and propose that origin activation is associated with local changes in chromatin organization. changes in chromatin architecture at origins seem to be intimately linked to their timing of activation and thus chromatin modulation in early and late origins is separated temporally. it is possible that changes in chromatin organization in origins might be required to allow the correct assembly/disassembly of replication factors before and after origin activation.

discussion
to elucidate the role of chromatin structure in the timing of origin firing in budding yeast, we conducted a high-resolution analysis of genome-wide nucleosomal organization at origins. our results revealed distinctive nucleosomal configurations in early and late replication origins. the high resolution of our nucleosome maps, together with the independent analysis of early and late origins clusters were critical to disclose these different nucleosomal architectures, emphasizing the notion that the average nucleosome profile of all replication origins hides important variations in origin structure.

previous studies have suggested that genomic regions upstream from genes tend to replicate early, while regions containing a gene end tend to replicate late  <cit> . in agreement with this, our analysis indicates that there is a strong coincidence of the major late patterns  at convergent igr that contain two gene ends, and moreover, they seem to be almost completely excluded from regions that do not contain any gene end . the situation seems to vary further for early origin patterns, because these can be found in regions that coincide with transcription initiation or termination, or both. however, it is unclear why late origin patterns are highly represented at convergent igr. it is possible that a higher rate of transcription termination at convergent igr may interfere with nucleosome stability, leading to the lower occupancy observed in late origin patterns. this possibility is supported by the fact that other convergent igr, non-associated with replication origins, also presented low nucleosome occupancy.

alternatively, the co-localization of origins and transcription initiation sites  may promote early firing. in this sense, replication origins from several organisms frequently contain transcription factor-binding sites  <cit> , arguing for a role of tf in origin regulation. in s. cerevisiae, the transcription factor abf <dig> seems to help origin activation  <cit> , and importantly, the transcription factor fkh is involved in early origin firing  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that origins located in the vicinity of a promoter would be more likely to bind fkh1/ <dig> transcription factors, which can strongly influence the selection of these origins for early firing. supporting this possibility, 81% of early origins enriched with fkh1/2-binding sites were in igrs containing at least one promoter, while only 19% were in promoter-free regions. however, only  <dig> % of the early origins analyzed contain fkh-binding sites, suggesting that the role of tf in origin activation might not be exclusive to fkh and that other tfs could also contribute to early firing in other origins. in fact, binding sites for other transcription factors have been found close to replication origins and have been implicated in origin activation in both yeast and mammals . future examination of the interactions between transcription and replication factors should provide important information about this issue.

regarding the distribution of fkh-binding motifs, the overlapping of predominant sites with the ndr origin feature suggests that the location of forkhead sites within an open/accessible chromatin region is important for origin regulation. in addition, the particular localization and spacing of fkh sites within ndr raise the possibility that the binding of tfs such as fkh1/ <dig> might also contribute to the maintenance of a nucleosome-free region and to the positioning of proximal nucleosomes, similar to the previously described role of orc-binding  <cit> .

the fact that both orc and fkh1/2-binding sites are restricted to the ndr suggests that the ndr is critical for accommodating functional complexes in the origins. the average ndr size from origin patterns 1– <dig> varies from  <dig> to 129 bp, indicating that different ndr widths are valid for origin activity. however, classes  <dig> and  <dig>  with the broadest ndrs, and classes  <dig> and  <dig>  with the narrowest ndrs, generally correlate with early and late replication respectively, indicating that ndr width might influence the timing of origin replication.

we propose that the different affinities of initiation factors for early and late origins would be determined by their different origin structure. thus, initiation factors might have a higher affinity for early origins that generally adopt class  <dig> and  <dig> conformations and show broader and better defined ndrs. the importance of an appropriate ndr width in origin timing is highlighted by the observation that previously described dormant origins such as ars <dig>  ars <dig>  ars <dig> and ars <dig> show either a closed ndr or an extremely small ndr  . dormant origins bind a pre-rc and are licensed in g <dig>  <cit> , and if given enough time they are competent to initiate replication  <cit> . this small ndr size probably imposes a critically low affinity for regulatory factors in these origins, being excluded for firing in a normal replication cycle. the higher occupancy by -1/+ <dig> nucleosomes in early origins suggests that the interaction of the initiation factors with the origin region or with some components of the pre-rc complex might be facilitated or mediated by interaction with these nucleosomes. in fact, previous studies have reported an interaction between transcriptional regulators and + <dig> and + <dig> nucleosomes  <cit> .

our results also revealed that origin architecture was actively modulated during origin firing. to visualize replication-dependent origin remodelling it is important to compare high-resolution maps from synchronized g <dig> and s samples, perhaps explaining why it passed unnoticed in previous studies performed on asynchronous cultures and/or with tiling microarrays  <cit> . an interesting possibility is that origin structure might be influenced by the different replication complexes or factors bound to the origin before and after origin firing. this is in agreement with the fact that some pre-rc components and/or initiation factors are bound and released from chromatin before and after origin activation  <cit> . interestingly, some initiation factors such as sld <dig> and cdc <dig> can be detected specifically at early firing origins during g <dig>  <cit> . these essential initiation factors are present in the cell in limiting amounts  <cit> , and it has been suggested that they are recycled from early to late origins during s phase. therefore, the dynamic of nucleosomes and replication proteins during the process of origin activation might be related, and we are currently examining this possibility.

in addition, we also examined the contribution of histone acetylation to early origin firing at the level of chromatin organization. our data indicate that increased levels of histone acetylation around origins induce local modifications in chromatin organization, creating a more accessible structure. one possibility is that histone acetylation might weaken histone/dna interactions, diminishing the chromatin association of acs-flanking nucleosomes and altering ndr formation. the resulting open conformation in origins might facilitate, either directly or indirectly , the recruitment of critical replication factors to origins.

taken together, the results reported argue for an important contribution of the chromatin structure to origin selection and firing, and help to understand the interplay between replication regulators such as fkh1/ <dig>  epigenetic modifications, and chromatin structure.

CONCLUSIONS
coordinated origin firing is important to ensure complete replication of the entire genome and recent evidences suggest that the replication temporal program can influence genome stability  <cit> . in this work, we have analyzed the role of chromatin structure in replication timing at the level of nucleosome organization. our data highlight the importance of chromatin features, such as the ndr and nucleosomes + <dig> and - <dig>  in the regulation of origin activation and timing. thus, early origins present broader ndr features and a high occupancy of flanking nucleosomes while tighter ndr and a lower occupancy appear in late origins. besides, factors involved in the establishment of origin timing such as histone deacetylation induce local modifications in these key origin features, leading to a more open origin conformation. similarly, fkh transcription factors seem to be in close relationship with origin structure, as suggested by the overlap of predominant fkh-binding sites with the ndr origin feature.

origin activation is also associated with local changes in chromatin organization. although the specific chromatin conformations of origins are already established in g <dig>  origin structure is dynamic during origin activation. it has been described that chromatin structure affects origin function  <cit> , and it would be possible that origin architecture can also affect the affinity and efficiency of the formation of replication complexes and, therefore, influence the timing of origin firing.
