BACKGROUND
poaceae have been the subject of numerous phylogenetic studies due to their economic and ecological importance, as well as their dominance in major terrestrial biomes . the current phylogenetic classification of poaceae includes a deep grade of three lineages: anomochlooideae, pharoideae, and puelioideae, as well as the crown grasses represented by the bep   <cit>  and pacmad   <cit>  clades. the pacmad clade is of particular interest in this study because despite its paramount economic and ecological importance, phylogenetic relationships among its major lineages remain uncertain.

the sister group to the bep clade has been variously defined as the pacc, paccad, paccmad, or pacmad clade with different constituent subfamilies. a previous study  <cit>  utilized the plastid gene sequence ndhf, which supported a monophyletic pacc  clade, as well as indicating the polyphyletic nature of arundinoideae. subsequent work by the grass phylogeny working group   <cit>  addressed weak support within and among the grass subfamilies by making use of informative characters in seven molecular datasets along with a morphological dataset. for comparative purposes we will refer to their results for three plastid sequences , and not their eight-dataset analysis, as these did not differ in subfamilial arrangement, or provide further resolution.

the gpwg also increased taxon sampling over those of previous phylogenetic studies to include representatives of  <dig> genera,  <dig> of which fell within a group described under the newly established paccad  clade  <cit> . three taxa that nested within the paccad clade  were classified as incertae sedis . arundinoideae were also found to lack unifying morphological or molecular synapomorphies to establish it as monophyletic. the genera classified as incertae sedis were analyzed further in a separate study with other representatives from eriachne and micraira through the use of  <dig> structural characters as well as ndhf and rpl <dig> plastid sequences  <cit> . their reinstatement of micrairoideae as a distinct subfamily changed the paccad acronym to paccmad. with increased taxon sampling across panicoideae and centothecoideae in a subsequent study  <cit> , it was concluded that centothecoideae were paraphyletic with panicoideae “…and the name should not have phylogenetic implications” . this study defined the constituent subfamilies of the pacmad clade and established a backbone phylogenetic hypothesis against which deeper phylogenetic relationships could be explored.

the second gpwg constructed the most detailed grass phylogeny to date  <cit> . one of their major goals was to determine the number of c <dig> photosynthesis origins across the pacmad clade. they analyzed  <dig> pacmad species, encompassing two thirds of the genera within the clade using the same plastid markers from the previous gpwg study . multiple phylogenetic analyses and an increase in taxonomic sampling provided support for aristidoideae as the sister subfamily to the rest of the clade. however, the relationship between panicoideae and the cmad  clade was only weakly supported  value: 61 %, posterior probability :  <dig> ), as well as the relationship between the ma  and dc  clades . furthermore, the arundinoids were only weakly supported as monophyletic.

deep divergence time estimates of pacmad grasses have been relatively few. this is partly because of the paucity of confidently dated grass fossils for use as calibration points at specific nodes  <cit> . the fossils used for calibration include pollen, phytoliths, and spikelets  <cit> . another contributing factor is the lack of a well-supported topology at the subfamilial level, especially for deep relationships within the pacmad clade, which requires sufficient molecular sequences. previous divergence estimates of the pacmad clade are highly variable and have been examined in the stem aristidoideae , crown pacmad , and stem panicoideae  . these four studies used a relatively small number of molecular markers in their phylogenetic analyses and the lack of informative characters likely caused the topologies to vary.

phylogenomic studies using complete plastomes from poaceae have provided strong support for the relationships within and among other subfamilies . this study addresses the weak support in previous research for deep nodes in the pacmad clade by utilizing complete plastomes. a plastome from one arundinoid species  was sequenced using sanger technology to provide a reference for annotation, and  <dig> additional complete plastomes were determined by next generation sequencing  methods for pacmad taxa. complete plastomes were analyzed phylogenomically and divergence dates estimated to seek potential selective causes for the pacmad radiation. the analyses presented here utilize more phylogenetically informative characters and well supported phylogenomic relationships to provide a greater accuracy of divergence estimates through the use of complete plastomes.

mitochondrial and plastome sequences may produce incongruent gene trees due to incomplete lineage sorting, recombination events, or potential elevated rates of substitution in grasses  <cit> . mitochondrial sequences were here explored with the goal of increasing maternally inherited character sampling among representative taxa. mitochondrial sequence data were extracted and analyzed, as a source of potentially conserved characters, which have proven useful in determining subfamilial relationships in combination with plastome sequences .

RESULTS
outgroup selection, plastome
the pacmad topology based on plastome data remained largely consistent across likelihood analyses conducted with different outgroups. in analyses of all but one outgroup taxon, panicoideae were sister to the remaining pacmad taxa. when the single taxon oryza sativa was selected as the outgroup, aristidoideae were sister to the remaining pacmad taxa with a bs value of 56 %. note that the use of o. rufipogon as an outgroup did not alter the topology in this way.

outgroup selection greatly influenced support values for the position of aristidoideae . considering only single-taxon outgroups, the choice of puelia olyriformis generated a bootstrap support  value of 67 % for the pacmad node. the use of the somewhat more closely related ehrhartoid species, oryza rufipogon, increased the bs value to 76 %. when bambusa oldhamii was used as the outgroup this node had a bs value of 80 %, but rhynchoryza subulata provided the greatest support, a bs value of 99 %. bambusa oldhamii was selected as the outgroup for the mitochondrial analysis since mitochondrial data were available for this species.

plastome characterization
the  <dig> new plastomes were largely conserved in gene content and organization. the short single copy  regions had ranges of  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp in length, long single copy regions  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, and inverted repeat regions  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp . a unique deletion of ~1140 bp was found in the rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> region of hakonechloa macra. this deletion eliminated all of rpl <dig> as well as the first 70 bp of rpl <dig> and the noncoding sequence between them. the deletion is found ~450 bp downstream of rpl <dig> and ~100 bp upstream of rps <dig> table  <dig> lengths of plastome subregions

plastome phylogenomic analyses
the maximum likelihood  analysis produced a tree with − lnl =  <dig> . the tree had mean terminal branch lengths  more than  <dig>  times greater than the mean of the internal branch lengths . in the topology generated from the ml analysis, panicoideae  are resolved as the sister subfamily to the rest of the pacmad clade . the next subfamily to diverge is aristidoideae, which is united with the cmad clade with a bs value of 77 %. chloridoideae is supported as sister to danthonioideae with a bs value of 100 %. the sister relationship between micrairoideae and arundinoideae is also supported with a bs value of 100 %. elytrophorus spicatus was embedded within the arundinoideae and resolved as sister to the clade of hakonechloa macra and phragmites australis with maximum bs support. the chloridoid/danthonioid clade is supported with a bs value of  <dig> as sister to the arundinoid/micrairoid clade. although the ml topology retrieved here was well-supported, the shimodaira-hasegawa  test failed to reject the alternative hypothesis of aristidoideae sister to the pcmad clade .the bayesian inference  topology was identical to the ml topology. the position of aristidoideae and all other nodes in the topology were supported with posterior probability  values of  <dig> . the same data matrix under parsimony analysis had  <dig>  parsimony informative sites. the maximum parsimony  analysis produced a single tree of length  <dig>  steps. the mp analysis had an ensemble consistency index of  <dig>  and retention index of  <dig> . the divergence order for the mp analysis varied slightly from the ml and bi analyses with aristidoideae sister to the rest of the pacmad subfamilies, followed by the panicoideae. bootstrap support values at each node were  <dig> with the exception of: the crown arundinoideae , crown dc , crown cmad , and crown panicoideae . the sister relationship of two outgroup taxa, triticum aestivum and aegilops geniculata, was supported with a bs value of 99 % in the mp analysis. the partitioned analysis, using only  <dig> protein coding sequences, produced identical topological results with similar bootstrap support and will not be further considered here.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogram produced from a complete plastome analysis of  <dig> species of pacmad grasses. each node that was fully supported with a ml bs value =  <dig>  mp bs value =  <dig> and a pp =  <dig> is labelled with *, except where noted . mp bootstrap values are marked na in the one case where the topology differed



mitochondrial analysis
the mitochondrial analysis produced a tree with -lnl =  <dig>  . panicoideae were monophyletic, but with relatively weak support . the sister relationships of t. maxima and centotheca lappacea as well as z. mays and coleataenia prionitis were each supported with bs values of 98 %. a bs value of 89 % supported danthonioideae as monophyletic. the sister relationship of danthonioideae and chloridoideae was retained, but with little support . arundinoideae, as sampled here, were characterized as monophyletic, but with bs value < 50 %.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogram produced from analysis of assembled and aligned mitochondrial matr and seven intron sequences from  <dig> species. branch lengths are proportional to the substitution rate along the branch. bambusa oldhamii was selected as the outgroup. bs values > <dig> and < <dig> are noted. nodes labelled with # denote bs values < <dig>  each node marked “i” was incongruent with our ml plastome analysis topology 



the deep mitochondrial topology differed greatly from that of the plastome analysis . arundinoideae were sister to the chloridoideae/danthonioideae clade with a bs value < 50 % unlike the relationships in gpwg ii  <cit>  or this paper . micrairoideae were polyphyletic and all bs values placing these three species were lower than in the plastid ml tree. the deep nodes of the mitochondrial topology were substantially incongruent to those from the plastome analyses and were not used here in further analyses of the deep pacmad nodes.

divergence date estimation
divergence dates were estimated under two calibration scenarios . the estimated divergence date at the crown pacmad node was  <dig>   mya and  <dig>   mya for calibration sets one and two respectively, indicating that the use of the controversial phytolith in the outgroup had little impact on the estimated age of this node. the aristidoideae divergence of  <dig>   mya for the first set and  <dig>   mya for the second set was the most variable between the two. in set two, the addition of another calibration point caused the stem and crown arundinoid divergences to decrease while the divergence dates of the crown micrairoid, danthonioid, panicoid and stem chloridoid lineages increased . the crown panicoid divergence date of  <dig>   mya for set one and  <dig>  mya for set two is also of note. our estimated date for the crown panicoideae is consistent with recent divergence estimates of andropogoneae  <cit> .table  <dig> divergence estimations for two beast analyses

discussion
short, deep branches of the pacmad clade in our analyses are consistent with rapid radiations early in this group. regardless of the cause, deep branches in the pacmad grasses are difficult to resolve. the full plastome phylogenomic analyses of the pacmad clade with hundreds of informative characters offer a clear advantage to understanding the deep divergences in the group. full plastome analysis and estimation of divergence times allows for speculation on the cause of this accelerated diversification.

phylogenomic analysis
phylogenetic analyses of rapid radiations in plant lineages tend to be challenging because long ingroup branches are connected only by short deep branches with relatively little phylogenetic information, which may hinder robust resolution of deep relationships  <cit> . when outgroups are on relatively long branches they can artifactually attract long ingroup branches and suggest erroneous relationships. the conflict between our ml and mp analyses is also suggestive of long-branch attraction to which parsimony is somewhat more susceptible  <cit> .

with one exception, each ml analysis generated an identical ingroup topology. long branch attraction tends to be indicative of homoplasious substitutions or possible elevated substitution rates, and may be responsible for the weakly supported result with o. sativa. this stands as a unique exception compared to all of the other outgroup combinations. several outgroup taxa produced less support for the stem aristidoideae. outgroup taxa were selected for their relatively close relationships to the pacmad grasses. bambusa oldhamii, oryza rufipogon, and rhynchoryza subulata presented stronger support for this node than the more distantly related puelia olyriformis. b. oldhamii exhibited a shorter terminal branch length than r. subulata and o. rufipogon  <cit> , which was correlated with greater support at the stem aristidoideae  that fell between those values when r. subulata  and o. rufipogon  were selected as outgroups. the inclusion of  <dig> outgroup taxa resulted in the addition of more phylogenetic information. although support for the sister relationship of panicoideae to the rest of the pacmad clade was less than that of analyses with a single outgroup taxon , the larger outgroup allowed for greater confidence in the ingroup topology.

a significant past study on the systematics of poaceae  <cit>  provided weak support for the sister relationship of panicoideae to the cmad clade  as well as between the micrairoid/arundinoid and danthonioid/chloridoid clades . although the taxon sampling of gpwg ii included  <dig> pacmad species, only three genetic markers of 600– <dig> base pairs  each were analyzed. the phylogenomic methods here allow for an increase in the number of molecular markers by several orders of magnitude to provide additional informative sites and raise support values for the phylogeny.

in our most well-supported likelihood topology , panicoideae are sister to the other pacmad grasses, and aristidoideae are sister to the cmad clade, but this relationship is not statistically different from the gpwg ii topology by the sh test. the difficulty in discriminating between these two alternative topologies may be due to the rapid radiation of the pacmad grasses. all subfamilies sampled with two or more species were recovered as monophyletic. within panicoideae, the two andropogoneae  were sisters as were two species formerly characterized as centothecoids  . complete plastome sequence analyses were thus able to provide greater support for phylogenetic relationships and suggests that further sampling of complete plastomes from pacmad taxa might be useful to address relationships at lower taxonomic levels. this analysis may be creating artifactual groups due to modest taxon sampling as compared to gpwg ii  <cit> , but greatly improves upon character sampling.

the ml topology of the mitochondrial data was substantially incongruent with our whole plastome phylogenies  and the relationships in the gpwgii analysis  <cit> , especially at the deepest nodes. this may be due to the relatively low rate of substitution seen in plant mitochondrial genomes, or their tendency to recombine with fragments of other genomes/organisms that could link loci with different evolutionary histories  <cit> . some subfamilies  were retrieved with moderate support. mitochondrial sequences may be more appropriately used as phylogenetic tools within subfamilies of pacmad grasses.

divergence estimates
previous studies have set out to determine divergence dates for pacmad grasses using many taxa, but with a relatively small number of molecular markers. the increase in molecular data in this study allows for a more accurate assessment of divergence dates at deep nodes due to the presence of a greater number of phylogenetically informative sites. the age of the bep/pacmad clade was recently estimated to be  <dig>   mya  <cit> . this estimate suggests that the bep and pacmad clades diverged at the approximate time of the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum   and the transition to the eocene era. the eocene is characterized as a period of cooling and drying, which led to forest fragmentation and created new or more extensive habitats for open habitat and forest margin species  <cit> .

the divergence of the pacmad subfamilies, which has been formerly estimated to fall between  <dig> mya  <cit>  and  <dig> mya  <cit> , was resolved at an age of  <dig>    mya in this analysis. the rapid radiation of the pacmad clade according to this somewhat younger estimate occurs along the eocene-oligocene transition . throughout the eocene there was a global cooling trend following antarctic glaciation events  <cit>  as well as declining atmospheric co <dig>  <cit> . these climatic changes influenced habitat diversification across the globe, increasing open habitats and forest margins for plant colonizations following the eot.

aristidoideae are almost exclusively open habitat grasses and the most parsimonious interpretation for the ancestral condition for the subfamily is that it was also an open habitat lineage  <cit> . if, as suggested by gpwg ii, the aristidoideae are sister to the other pacmad grasses, then the exploitation of open habitats long preceded the radiation of the pacmad clade for which there is no corresponding explanatory hypothesis  <cit> . in the context of the overall grass phylogeny, pacmad habitat shifts are more parsimoniously interpreted if the sister group to other pacmad species has the ancestral habitat type. note that the deeply diverging lineages puelioideae, pharoideae, and anomochlooideae, are exclusively found on forest floors  <cit> . panicoideae comprise genera that occur in shady habitats, open habitats, and mixed habitats  <cit> . this kind of habitat diversity among species of the subfamily sister to the rest of the pacmad clade would be expected if climatic changes promoted the radiation and diversification of open habitat species at the time of the eot. species composition of these descendants, which are resolved here as the sister group to the rest of the pacmad lineage, would be expected to fill both shade tolerant and open habitat niches, which is seen in contemporary panicoideae  <cit> . notably, in our analysis the lineages sister to the rest of panicoideae are forest margin  and shade tolerant  species  <cit> , consistent with the hypothesis that the panicoideae initially occupied forests and forest margins, and then radiated, possibly multiple times, into open habitats.

CONCLUSIONS
deep pacmad relationships are here retrieved with greater support than in previous studies through the use of a phylogenomic approach. our results support a pacmad topology where panicoideae is sister to the acmad clade allowing for further exploration of terminal relationships. it also offers a general phylogenomic approach for investigating rapidly radiating plant lineages.

divergence estimates for the pacmad clade provide insight into the putative role of climate changes leading to habitat diversification, which possibly triggered the rapid radiation of these grasses. the date of  <dig>  mya for the initial radiation of the lineage is correlated with the eot. glaciation events and an overall global cooling trend throughout the eocene led to environmental diversification via forest fragmentation and expansion of open habitats. these changes may have allowed grasses to rapidly speciate, hybridize, and ultimately dominate newly developed habitats.
