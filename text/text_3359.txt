BACKGROUND
in contrast to higher vertebrates, which have adaptive immune response systems, invertebrates exclusively rely on the innate immune system . for a long time it was assumed that only the adaptive system is capable of mounting highly specific defense responses. however, evidence is accumulating that invertebrates have surprisingly complex immune systems that in theory may have the potential to produce similar specificities . yet, to date, we possess only little information on the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying such specificities. first insights into these mechanisms were previously obtained for the model nematode c. elegans, an important invertebrate system for studying immune defense  <cit> . for example, loss of function of the prolylhydroxylase encoding gene egl- <dig> enhances susceptibility to staphylococcus aureus  <cit>  but resistance to pseudomonas aeruginosa   <cit>  and bacillus thuringiensis toxins  <cit> . similarly, a loss of function of the toll-like receptor gene tol- <dig> increases susceptibility to salmonella enterica but resistance to enterococcus faecalis  <cit> , even though the general importance of tol- <dig> in worm immunity is unclear  <cit> .

such specificities may not only be expressed by the nematode’s physiological immune system, but could also be expected for behavioral defenses. such behaviors are a central component of immune defense sensu lato - next to protective barriers and physiological processes - and are likely to represent a highly economic immune defense strategy because they simultaneously reduce pathogen contact, and thus the risk of tissue damage, and also the necessity to activate the energetically costly physiological and cellular response  <cit> . c. elegans colonizes microbe-rich habitats in nature where it feeds on bacteria and yeasts . since these habitats also contain many pathogenic microorganisms, c. elegans has evolved distinct types of behavioral responses including physical avoidance, associative learning and reduced oral uptake of pathogens .

previous studies revealed the presence of substantial genetic variation among wild isolates of c. elegans in their behavioral response towards different pathogens . in one case, namely the defense response against the gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa, this variation could be linked to the polymorphic neuropeptide receptor npr- <dig> locus on the x chromosome. the gene npr- <dig> was proposed to regulate c. elegans’ immunity against pa <dig> either through controlling the aerotaxis response  <cit> , or through controlling both aerotaxis response and physiological immune defense  <cit> . npr- <dig> is a homolog of the mammalian neuropeptide y receptor gene and it is found in two different isoforms in c. elegans that result from a single amino acid change at position  <dig>   <cit> . these isoforms do not only influence pathogen defense but also foraging behavior in response to oxygen concentrations  <cit>  and leaving behavior from lawns with the laboratory food bacterium escherichia coli  <cit> .

the apparent complexity of the c. elegans defense against pathogens  raises the question whether single pathways or genes can also fine-tune the behavioral defense response towards specific pathogens. to address this question we studied the genetic architecture of behavioral immune defense of c. elegans towards the gram-positive pathogen bacillus thuringiensis. this pathogen is likely to coexist with c. elegans in nature  <cit> . some strains are nematocidal, whereby the host is infected by the oral uptake of spore-toxin mixtures. infection of the gut is followed by toxin-mediated cellular damage of the intestinal epidermis, germination of spores and subsequent proliferation of vegetative cells, including expression of various virulence factors, ultimately resulting in nematode death . nematocidal b. thuringiensis induces pronounced behavioral responses in c. elegans  <cit> .

here we explored genetic variation in c. elegans and used quantitative trait locus  analysis to characterize the genetic basis of behavioral immune defense against two pathogenic b. thuringiensis strains, whereby one strains  is known to be more pathogenic than the other   <cit> . our qtl analysis was based on a panel of  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  and  <dig> introgression lines , derived from a cross between the c. elegans strains n <dig> and cb <dig>  <cit> . our qtl analysis identified npr- <dig> as one of the candidate genes, though with an opposite effect on avoidance behavior to that previously reported towards p. aeruginosa  <cit> . therefore, we further characterized the function of the npr- <dig> gene in producing contrasting pathogen defense responses. using npr- <dig> mutants, we assessed the influence of the gene on both avoidance behavior and survival towards the two pathogen species, b. thuringiensis and p. aeruginosa. moreover, we used rnaseq to identify differences in the pathogen-dependent transcription of npr- <dig> down-stream targets. the functional importance of such differences was assessed through enrichment analysis of gene ontology  categories, customized nematode-specific gene sets, which we collated from previous gene expression analyses, and transcription factor binding motifs.

RESULTS
two c. elegans wild-type strains differ in bacterial lawn leaving behavior
the standard laboratory strain n <dig> and the hawaiian strain cb <dig> showed significant variation in lawn-leaving behavior towards nematocidal b. thuringiensis strains  and non-nematocidal strains . lawn leaving served as a proxy for behavioral defense and was based on an assay  related to those previously used to characterize c. elegans avoidance behavior  <cit> , in this case using peptone-free medium  to prevent b. thuringiensis spore germination outside the host . lawn leaving behavior was significantly higher for cb <dig> compared to n <dig> on all tested bacterial strains and for all exposure time periods . for both c. elegans strains, we observed a significant increase in leaving across time . for both, the avoidance response towards the most pathogenic strain  was higher than that towards the less pathogenic strain  .fig.  <dig> variation in lawn leaving behavior between n <dig> and cb <dig> towards different bacterial strains. lawn leaving behavior towards:  the non-pathogenic e. coli strain op50;  the non-nematocidal b. thuringiensis strain dsm350;  the nematocidal b. thuringiensis strain b-18247; and  the highly nematocidal b. thuringiensis strain b- <dig>  the y axis shows the leaving index for n <dig>  or cb <dig> , calculated as the proportion of nematodes which left the bacterial lawn; the x axis indicates the different exposure time points. asterisks denote the treatments for which leaving behavior of cb <dig> is significantly different from n <dig>  the dotted reference line shows a leaving index of  <dig> . error bars represent standard error of the mean. raw data are given in sheet  <dig> of additional file  <dig>  detailed statistical results are shown in additional file 3




our results confirm previously reported higher avoidance behavior and resistance of cb <dig> compared to n <dig> towards one of the pathogens used in the current study, b. thuringiensis b- <dig>  <cit> . our findings are also consistent with two previous studies that demonstrated a higher op50-patch leaving behavior  <cit>  and a higher microsporidia resistance of cb <dig> compared to n <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the opposite phenotype has been reported regarding the nematode’s response to two other pathogens, p. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. in these cases, n <dig> rather than cb <dig> produced higher resistance and behavioral avoidance towards p. aeruginosa  <cit> , and higher avoidance towards s. marcescens  <cit> . moreover, as the more pathogenic b- <dig> was more strongly avoided than the less virulent b- <dig> , c. elegans appears to be able to differentiate between different levels of pathogenicity of the same bacterial species. in this case, the difference in pathogenicity is likely due to expression of different cry toxins that result in different infection patterns  <cit> . based on our results we expect that the n <dig> and cb4856-derived ril and il populations are likely to contain sufficiently high levels of variation for a qtl analysis of avoidance behaviors towards the four chosen bacterial strains.

multiple qtls and their interactions account for variation in avoidance behavior
we performed qtl analyses on c. elegans pathogen defense and revealed the genetic architecture of pathogen avoidance behavior to  be polygenic,  include epistatically interacting loci, and  incorporate general as well as pathogen-specific avoidance loci. in particular, our study simultaneously assessed the behavioral response of  <dig> rils and  <dig> ils  <cit>  towards four bacterial strains  at two exposure time points  and with three replicates per treatment combination, using the same lawn leaving assays as above for n <dig> and cb <dig>  below we present our results of a main-effect qtl analysis of the ril population and an analysis of interaction effects among loci for the ril population.

the main effect qtl analysis uncovered five main regions associated with avoidance:  one large region in the middle of chromosome ii, for which the cb <dig> allele increase leaving behavior of the non-pathogenic bacteria only at the 24 h time point ;  a region on chromosome ii, for which the n <dig> allele specifically increase avoidance of the more pathogenic strain b- <dig> at the 24 h time point ;  a region on the left arm of chromosome iv, for which the n <dig> allele increase leaving behavior towards controls and pathogens ;  a region on the right arm of chromosome iv, for which the cb <dig> allele increase avoidance of pathogens at both time points ; and  a region on chromosome x with the strongest effect on leaving behavior towards controls and pathogens , mediated by the cb <dig> allele and including a significant time effect on the response to the pathogenic bacteria . this very strong x chromosome effect was confirmed by the ils .fig.  <dig> qtl profiles for single marker mapping of avoidance behavior. qtl analysis of avoidance of:  e. coli op50;  the non-nematocidal b. thuringiensis dsm350;  nematocidal b-18247; and  highly nematocidal b- <dig>  the x-axis shows the markers along the five autosomes and the x chromosome. vertical light gray lines denote the boundaries between chromosomes. the y-axis indicates the association between the chromosomal markers and variation in avoidance. significance is indicated by –log <dig> of the p-value obtained from the linear model, which is multiplied by the sign of the effect to indicate the n <dig> allelic effect on avoidance. a value above  <dig> indicates an increase in leaving caused by the n <dig> allele; a value below  <dig> indicates an increase in leaving caused by the cb <dig> allele. by convention, values above + <dig> or below - <dig> are considered to indicate a significant influence. green and red lines show the results after either 14 h or 24 h exposure, respectively



our analysis of interaction effects among qtls, using a standard interaction model , revealed several significant intra-genomic associations with an influence on lawn leaving behavior. for e. coli, significant interactions were found for at least two cases :  between the beginning of chromosome i and the first half of chromosome x; and  between the end of chromosome ii and almost the entire iv chromosome. for dsm <dig>  we identified interaction effects between:  the end of chromosome iv and the first quarter of chromosome x; and  the end of chromosome ii and almost the entire iv chromosome . the latter seems to be specific for food patch leaving behavior as it was identified for both of the non-pathogenic bacteria . for the nematocidal b- <dig>  we found interaction effects at least between:  the beginnings of chromosome ii and v; and  the second quarter of chromosome ii and the beginning of chromosome x . for the highly nematocidal b- <dig>  several interaction effects were identified including:  between the ends of chromosome i and ii; and  between the second quarter and the middle of chromosome iv . interestingly, the x chromosome region with the strongest influence in the main effect model  only contributed to very few significant interaction effects. one of these is an interaction with a chromosome i region,mediating avoidance of e. coli op <dig> , and another one with a chromosome iv region, influencing avoidance of dsm <dig> .fig.  <dig> heat-map of interaction effects for avoidance behavior. results for avoidance of:  e. coli op50;  dsm350;  nematocidal b-18247; and  nematocidal b- <dig>  the distribution of markers across the genome is shown on both axes. the chromosome boundaries are indicated by the thin vertical and horizontal lines. a color legend for significance of the interaction between markers is shown on top of the panels. significance is in –log <dig>  high significance values are given in “warm” colors with purple and red indicating the highest significances, followed by orange and then yellow. for example, in panel  showing the results for b- <dig>  the thin red area towards the bottom right indicates a significant interaction between loci from the beginning of the x chromosome  and the middle of chromosome ii . the other slightly larger red area in the bottom right of this panel points to a significant interaction between the beginning of chromosome v  and the beginning of chromosome ii 



taken together, our results demonstrate that pathogen avoidance has a complex genetic architecture in c. elegans, which overlaps with, but differs from the response to non-pathogenic microbes. in particular, pathogen defense traits are related to the response to non-pathogenic bacteria, because they are affected by the same loci. defense is thus in part determined by the general response to microbes, whereby pathogenicity of the bacteria may simply elevate the response mediated by a particular locus, as indicated for the x chromosome qtl . moreover, our results for the pathogen-specific qtls are consistent with the previous finding that pathogen defense in invertebrate animals seems to rely on few loci and involve epistatic interactions among them  <cit> , possibly as a consequence of reciprocal coevolution among host and pathogens  <cit> . it will be a rewarding challenge for the future to characterize the genes underlying the pathogen-specific qtls. interestingly, the main effect qtl on the x chromosome was previously implicated in lawn leaving behavior with similar allelic effects towards the non-pathogenic e. coli op <dig>  but with opposite allelic effects towards p. aeruginosa . in these cases, the qtl effect on chromosome x could be associated with variation in the gene npr- <dig>  and, at least towards e. coli, additionally the catecholamine receptor gene tyra- <dig>  <cit> .

the npr- <dig> gene affects defense against b. thuringiensis
the gene npr- <dig> was previously linked to the strong-effect qtl on chromosome x  <cit> , which we found in the current study to influence c. elegans defense towards b. thuringiensis in the opposite way than that towards p. aeruginosa. we therefore specifically tested whether this gene is indeed responsible for the contrasting phenotypes in pathogen avoidance and resistance.

we first studied the role of npr- <dig> in lawn leaving behavior on e. coli and b. thuringiensis using two mutants , npr-1), which were both previously shown to decrease pathogen avoidance behavior against p. aeruginosa  <cit> . another gene from the left arm of chromosome x was previously demonstrated to influence food patch leaving behavior, namely tyra- <dig>  which encodes a tyramine receptor homologue  <cit> . therefore, we further tested its involvement in pathogen defense with the knock-out mutant tyra- <dig> 

analysis of the two mutant npr- <dig> alleles , npr-1) yielded different results in avoidance and resistance . in particular, avoidance behavior of npr- <dig> was similar to cb <dig> but higher than that of n <dig> . in contrast, npr- <dig> always produced a low leaving rate, similar to n <dig> and clearly different from cb <dig>  on the highly pathogenic b- <dig>  avoidance behavior was extremely high at both time points without any significant differences among the c. elegans strains . in addition, the tyra- <dig> mutant consistently showed a similar behavioral response to n <dig>  irrespective of the bacterium and the exposure time .fig.  <dig> lawn leaving behavior for n <dig>  cb <dig>  and different mutants towards e. coli and b. thuringiensis. results for avoidance of:  e. coli op50;  non-nematocidal b. thuringiensis dsm350;  nematocidal b. thuringiensis b-18247; and  highly nematocidal b- <dig>  the y axis shows the proportion of escaped worms ; the x axis shows the two time points at which leaving was scored. the asterisk  is shown for the treatments which differ significantly from n <dig> whereas the hash sign  indicates significant differences from cb <dig>  the dotted reference line shows a leaving proportion of  <dig>  for orientation among sub-panels. error bars represent standard error of the mean. raw data are given in sheet  <dig> of additional file 2; detailed statistical results in additional file 6

the npr- <dig> alleles produced similarly contrasting effects on survival rate, which is often used as a proxy for nematode immunity. for the ril/il parental strains, we found that cb <dig> showed significantly higher resistance than n <dig> on both nematocidal b. thuringiensis strains . moreover, the npr- <dig> mutant was significantly more resistant than n <dig> and as resistant as cb <dig> on both nematocidal pathogens, whereas npr- <dig> was as susceptible as n <dig> on both pathogenic strains . none of the c. elegans strains showed any mortality under control conditions .

we conclude that the two mutant npr- <dig> alleles produce opposite effects on both behavioral avoidance of the four bacterial strains and also resistance against nematocidal b. thuringiensis. consequently, variation in npr- <dig> may only partially explain the strong main effect qtl on the x chromosome. the difference between the two npr- <dig> alleles in avoidance and resistance of b. thuringiensis is surprising, because both alleles behaved similarly in previous studies investigating resistance against p. aeruginosa  <cit> . yet the two alleles carry different mutations: npr- <dig> two in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas the mutation of npr- <dig> falls into exon  <dig> . the exact reasons for the different effects of these alleles clearly deserve further investigation in the future, ideally including additional loss-of-function and also reduced-function npr- <dig> alleles in combination with a tissue-specific analysis of the mutational effects. we further conclude that the tyra- <dig> gene does not appear to influence the assayed phenotypes , including avoidance of e. coli op <dig>  which was however previously demonstrated in a separate study  <cit> . the difference in results could be due to variation in experimental approaches. for example, we directly characterized leaving behavior, whereas the previous study scored activity as a proxy for leaving behavior  <cit> .

contrasting effect of npr- <dig> on defense against pseudomonas aeruginosa
we sought to confirm the previously published finding  that the wild-type n <dig> produces higher resistance and stronger avoidance behavior towards the pathogen p. aeruginosa pa <dig> than the hawaiian strain cb <dig> and two npr- <dig> mutants , thus contrasting with our above results for b. thuringiensis. here, we specifically re-evaluated these previous results under our laboratory conditions and assay protocols, using the peptone-rich ngm plates required for expression of p. aeruginosa virulence. we first used the lawn leaving assay to assess the avoidance response against pa <dig> at different exposure time points. consistent with previous findings, the npr- <dig> mutants and cb <dig> showed significantly lower pa <dig> pathogen avoidance than n <dig> across all time points . for the 48 h time point the mutant npr- <dig> even had a lower leaving response than cb <dig> . on op <dig>  leaving behavior was similar for all c. elegans strains at all time points except at time point 14 h, when the mutant npr- <dig> showed a more pronounced leaving behavior than n <dig> . in this assay, we also included a tyra- <dig> mutant, which expressed a similar leaving response to n <dig> under all conditions except at time point 48 h, where its leaving response against pa <dig> was reduced in comparison to n <dig>  but still significantly higher than that of the remaining strains .fig.  <dig> lawn leaving behavior for n <dig>  cb <dig> and different mutants towards e. coli and p. aeruginosa. results for:  e. coli op50; and  p. aeruginosa strain pa <dig>  the y axis shows the proportion of escaped worms; the x axis shows the three time points at which leaving was scored . the asterisk  denotes the treatments which differ significantly from n <dig>  whereas the hash sign  indicates significant differences from cb <dig>  the dotted reference line shows a leaving proportion of  <dig> . error bars represent standard error of the mean. the raw data are provided in sheet  <dig> of additional file 2; detailed statistical results in additional file 12




we next evaluated the effect of npr- <dig> on resistance against pa <dig> using standard c. elegans survival assays. all strains survived less on the pathogen pa <dig> than on the control op <dig> . on the pathogen, n <dig> was significantly more resistant than all other tested strains .fig.  <dig> survival of n <dig>  cb <dig>  npr- <dig> and npr- <dig> on e. coli and p. aeruginosa. results for:  e. coli op50; and  p. aeruginosa strain pa <dig>  survival  was plotted against time in hours . we used the kaplan-meier method to calculate survival fractions. the raw data are given in sheet  <dig> of additional file 2; statistical results in additional files  <dig> and 14




we conclude that npr- <dig> directly influences avoidance of pa <dig>  in agreement with previous work . in these studies, npr- <dig> was suggested to affect pa <dig> resistance either as a consequence of hyperoxia avoidance behavior only  or through both hyperoxia avoidance and the regulation of physiological immune responses .

our results further demonstrate that the two c. elegans wild-type strains express opposite phenotypes on the two tested pathogens and that this contrast may be mediated at least partially by npr- <dig>  as one of the npr- <dig> alleles also produces an opposite phenotype relative to n <dig>  such opposite effects in the wild-type strains indicate specific interactions with pathogens. the underlying genetics for such specificities have not yet been explored for behavioral immune defense. some information is available for physiological and cellular immune specificities. in the higher vertebrates, such specificities can be mediated by components of the adaptive immune system such as the highly variable receptors of the major histocompatibility complex or the highly variable t and b cell receptors. similar specificities have also been recorded in invertebrates  <cit> , where they may be due to different immune signaling cascades. for example, in drosophila, the immune deficiency pathway appears to be more important in the systemic response to gram-negative bacteria, whereas the toll pathway is more important towards gram-positive bacteria and fungi  <cit> . moreover, in c. elegans, mutations in the egl- <dig> and tol- <dig> gene enhance resistance against some pathogens, while simultaneously increasing susceptibility to other pathogens . our study thus provides one of the few examples which demonstrate that a single gene, in this case the neuropetide y receptor homolog gene npr- <dig>  produces contrasting pathogen specificities in an invertebrate.

at the same time, it is less clear how exactly npr- <dig> causes these contrasting phenotypes. previous work on nematode social behavior demonstrated that npr- <dig> influences worm aggregation, lawn bordering and clumping through its effect on aerotaxis behavior. the two tested npr- <dig> alleles and also that of the cb <dig> strain result in a preference towards lower oxygen concentrations usually found at the edge of the bacterial lawn  <cit> , whereas the n <dig> allele shows no such preference. a similar difference in aerotaxis behavior may also explain the reduced p. aeruginosa avoidance and resulting higher susceptibilities of the cb <dig> and npr- <dig> mutant strains, which remain in longer contact with the harmful pathogen, because the bacterial lawn boundaries show the preferred lower oxygen concentrations  <cit> . an involvement of such aerotaxis behavior in the b. thuringiensis response of cb <dig> and one of the npr- <dig> mutants would then require that the preferred oxygen concentration is outside of the bacterial lawn, which is unlikely to be the case . thus, it is conceivable that cb <dig> and the one npr- <dig> mutant are directly responding to a compound produced by b. thuringiensis, and that this response is less pronounced in the n <dig> strain and the other npr- <dig> mutant. in this context, it is worth noting that the high variation between n <dig> and cb <dig> in their leaving response towards the control e. coli op <dig> was only observed on peptone free pfm but not the peptone-rich ngm assay plates . this is most likely explained by bacterial proliferation, which is possible on ngm but not pfm assay plates. in turn, the lack of proliferation on the pfm plates is unlikely to coincide with large variation in oxygen concentration, such that an aerotaxis response should be less pronounced under these conditions. yet, a non-proliferating, static bacterial population may produce particular metabolites, which then could have induced the cb <dig> avoidance response.

npr- <dig> influences the transcriptomic response to b. thuringiensis and p. aeruginosa
to explore the mechanisms underlying the npr- <dig> mediated contrasting effects on immune defense, we assessed whether npr- <dig> differentially affects gene expression in the presence of either of the two pathogens. using rnaseq we compared the transcriptomes of the n <dig> and npr- <dig> strains exposed to either the nematocidal b. thuringiensis b- <dig>  the pathogenic p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  or the control e. coli op <dig>  we chose the mutant npr- <dig> because it showed differential leaving behavior and survival on both pathogens compared to n <dig> . exposure experiments were performed on agar plates fully covered with bacterial lawns, thus reducing possible avoidance behaviors and producing comparable levels of lawn occupancy for the worms from the various treatment combinations. rna transcript levels were characterized at two time points, 12 h and 24 h of pathogen exposure. we used principal component analysis  to explore which experimental factors generated different transcriptional responses. the first principal component indicated that the two nematode strains vary in their transcriptional signature to all three bacteria . the second principal component highlights variation across several additional factors. the strongest effect stems from exposure time . additional influences can be seen for pathogen exposure versus the corresponding control, especially at the later time point  and also a clearly distinct signal after 24 h exposure to pa <dig> compared to all other conditions . these latter differences are more pronounced for n <dig> than the npr- <dig> mutant, especially as n <dig> produces clearly distinct treatment signatures at the later 24 h time point . one possible reason for lower differentiation in the npr- <dig> mutant may be a lower number of differentially expressed genes compared to the n <dig> strain. this was indeed the case, especially upon pathogen exposure , suggesting that mutations in npr- <dig> somehow compromise the signalling response to pathogen infection.fig.  <dig> principal component analysis of transcriptomic variation. variation is assessed for npr- <dig> and n <dig> upon exposure to pathogens  and the control bacterium op <dig>  n <dig> is shown in blue whereas npr- <dig> is shown in red. light and dark colors indicate the early and late time point, respectively . filled and open symbols denote exposure to pathogens  and control bacteria , respectively. ngm is the nematode growth medium enriched with peptone for the pa <dig> assay plates, pfm refers to peptone-free ngm used for the b- <dig> assay plates

rnaseq was used to assess variation in gene expression among the c. elegans n <dig> and npr- <dig> mutant strain in response to exposure to nematocidal b. thuringiensis b- <dig> and p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  always relative to the respective e. coli op <dig> control. gene expression variation was studied at two time points, 12 h and 24 h after initial exposure. the results are shown separately for the up- and down-regulated genes 



to identify groups of co-regulated genes, we next performed k-means clustering on the significant gene sets. the resulting eight clusters confirm that the transcriptional response is influenced by the c. elegans strain, the pathogen strain and also the exposure time point . in detail, clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> refer to genes with strong differential expression upon exposure to only pathogenic b. thuringiensis b- <dig> in only the c. elegans n <dig> strain, but neither the npr- <dig> mutant on the same pathogen nor any of the other treatments with p. aeruginosa . this result again highlights that the npr- <dig> mutant shows generally lower responsiveness in inducible gene expression . clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> only responded to the pathogen b- <dig>  and clusters  <dig> and  <dig> only or at least predominantly to pa <dig>  two clusters are specific to expression variation at the 12 h time point, in both cases upon exposure to b- <dig> , whereas four clusters indicate a more pronounced response at the later 24 h time point, either towards only b- <dig>  or only pa <dig> . the remaining two clusters highlight patterns of early or continuous transcriptional response towards b- <dig> and late transcriptional response towards pa <dig> . none of the identified clusters showed an opposite gene expression pattern between either n <dig> and the npr- <dig> mutant  or the two pathogens . taken together, clusters  <dig> and  <dig> appear to encompass a general defense response against both pathogens, whereas the clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> define the specific response to b- <dig> and clusters  <dig> and  <dig> that to pa <dig>  therefore, the latter two groupings are likely to account for the observed npr- <dig> dependent defense differences towards the two pathogens. we thus conclude that the considered mutation in the npr- <dig> gene causes a decreased transcriptomic response to the two pathogens, which induce overlapping and distinct sets of differentially expressed genes.fig.  <dig> co-regulation of the differentially expressed genes. k-means cluster analysis yielded eight clusters of co-regulated genes, as indicated by the numbers on the left. the top of the graph shows the different treatment conditions, including c. elegans strain, pathogen strain and exposure time point. red refers to up-regulated genes, whereas blue to down-regulated genes, always upon pathogen exposure relative to the corresponding e. coli op <dig> control. high color intensities indicate strong expression differences to the control . the complete results are given in additional file 15




different functions and signaling processes are affected by the pathogen-dependent npr-1-specific transcriptome
we used enrichment analysis as a statistical tool to explore the possible functions of the differentially regulated gene clusters. four types of enrichment analyses were performed, which aim to identify significant over-representation of  genes with a specific gene ontology  term ;  customized nematode-specific gene sets, inferred from previous gene expression analyses and based on the program ease ;  genes with specific transcription factor-binding motifs , and  expression qtls . the customized enrichment analysis with the program ease  <cit>  was based on a large database of all previous c. elegans transcriptome studies, wormexp  <cit> , which we collated from published work. these studies investigated differential gene expression  across development,  in specific tissues,  in worms with defined mutations or subjected to rnai-knockdown of specific genes, or  upon exposure to environmental stimuli such as pathogens, heavy metals, and other chemical compounds  <cit> . the go term and motif analyses were based on published methods, such as david  <cit>  and amd  <cit> . analysis of eqtl enrichment expression differences, using the eqtl database collated from different previous eqtl analyses, all based on ril panels derived from n <dig> and cb <dig> as parental lines , thus potentially allowing us to link the identified qtls to the expression variation inferred against pathogens. the results are summarized in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  table  <dig>  additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  and explained in more detail below.fig.  <dig> functional consequences of gene expression variation between npr- <dig> and n <dig> upon pathogen exposure. a enrichment of gene ontology  terms. the shown terms were significant with fdr <  <dig>  . b overview of enrichment of pathogen- and stress-induced gene sets, inferred from ease analysis on the various clusters of co-regulated genes. the significantly enriched gene sets are indicated on the top and include - from left to right - differentially expressed genes upon exposure to  b. thuringiensis cry5b toxin  <cit> ; - the same b- <dig> strain used in the current study in c. elegans isolate my <dig> or my <dig>  <cit> ; - the same pa <dig> strain used here  <cit> ;  oxidative stress response  <cit> ; - osmotic induction  <cit> ; - heavy metal cadmium dysregulated genes  <cit> ;  pesticide influence  <cit> . c overview of enriched gene sets for selected immunity pathways and general categories, including - the p <dig> mapk pathway ; - insulin signalling ;  npr- <dig> targets  <cit> ;  glycoproteins; - cytochrome p <dig> ;  protein kinase  <cit> ;  lipid metabolism  <cit> ;  cell division  <cit> . d enrichment of ebox and gata motifs and their transcriptional targets. the enriched gene sets were inferred with ease and are indicated at the top, including differentially expressed genes in mutants of - e-box transcriptions factors  <cit>  or - gata transcription factors elt- <dig> and elt- <dig>  <cit> . enriched transcription factor binding motifs were inferred with amd and are shown on the right . in all panels, the clusters are given on the very left and are identical to those in fig.  <dig>  red color indicates an enrichment for up-regulated genes per gene set, blue that for down-regulated genes per gene set. color intensity corresponds to the significance level, inferred by ease analysis

eqtl enrichment analysis was performed to identify significant overlaps between the genes underlying a specific cluster in our analysis  and previously characterized gene sets that define particular eqtls . such overlaps can then be linked to the specific qtl regions within the genome , which may then contain regulatory elements important for the expression variation in our study and which may also have been identified as qtls for the observed variation in behavioral immune defense . for further details see additional file  <dig>  no significant enrichment was found for cluster 4



we first focus on the general defense response against the two pathogens, which is defined by two clusters . these clusters are enriched for genes previously implicated in c. elegans pathogen defense. these include genes involved in carbohydrate binding , most likely mediated by c type lectin-like genes, many of which underlie this go term  and which are up-regulated across treatment conditions  and have repeatedly been implicated in c. elegans immunity, possibly as pathogen recognition receptors or antimicrobials . these two clusters are also enriched for genes which were previously shown to respond to exposure to the same pathogens and other types of stressors, such as heavy metals, osmotic stress, or pesticides . the upregulated genes appear to be controlled by two of the main c. elegans immunity signalling cascades, the p <dig> mapk and the insulin-like receptor pathways   <cit> , and also the npr- <dig> gene   <cit> . they also show an enrichment in their promotor sequences for a gata binding motif, although not for known targets of the gata transcription factors elt- <dig> and elt- <dig> . they are also enriched for gene sets defined by eqtls on chromosome i, iii, the middle of chromosome iv, and the left arm and the middle of chromosome x . one of the enriched x chromosome eqtls encompasses the npr- <dig> gene, another the gene sek- <dig> of the p <dig> mapk cascade, and the one on chromosome iv may include the mapk gene jnk- <dig> or the p <dig> homolog pmk- <dig>  additionally supporting the role of these genes in the nematode’s expression response. the enriched eqtls from chromosome iv and the left arm of the x chromosome also lie within the qtls identified to influence behavioral defense against b. thuringiensis . taken together, we conclude that clusters  <dig> and  <dig> comprise the components of a general defense response, apparently active not only against pathogens but also other stressors and mediated by central stress and immune response pathways. in the npr- <dig> mutant, this defense response is strongly reduced towards both pathogens.

the specific response to p. aeruginosa is captured by two clusters . they are enriched for eqtls on chromosome i, v, and x , although in chromosomal regions without any known regulator of immune defense. these clusters, especially the upregulated cluster, are however enriched for genes previously shown to respond to infection by the same pathogen  and also those involved in the response to oxidative stress and xenobiotics, including cadmium and pesticides . the response to oxidative stress and xenobiotics is dominated by an up-regulation of cytochrome p <dig> genes . the up-regulated cluster is further influenced by the two main immunity pathways, the npr- <dig> gene, and also a gata transcription factor . all of the latter components have previously been shown to be central for immune defense against p. aeruginosa, especially the p <dig> mapk signalling cascade  <cit>  and the gata transcription factor elt- <dig>  <cit> . the transcriptomic response to p. aeruginosa infection is additionally strongly influenced by cytochrome p <dig> expression, possibly as part of a general stress response to reduce oxidative stress . because these responses are activated more strongly in the n <dig> strain, they are likely to mediate the observed higher resistance and behavioral defense for this strain compared to the npr- <dig> mutant .fig.  <dig> model of npr- <dig> dependent effects on pathogen defense in the n <dig> c. elegans strain. exposure to both pathogens leads to an npr- <dig> dependent activation of carbohydrate-binding factors, such as c-type lectin-like proteins, and also two central immune signaling cascades, the p <dig> mapk and the insulin-like pathways, which could all enhance pathogen resistance . upon exposure to p. aeruginosa pa <dig> , npr- <dig> also influences the activation of a general stress response, via one or several gata transcription factors, which increases oxidative stress resistance and thus resistance to the pathogen. the response to b. thuringiensis  is mediated by npr- <dig> through one or several ebox transcription factors, resulting in a reduced oxidative stress response and increased metabolic activity as a possible cause of enhanced pathogen susceptibility. arrows with light colors indicate uncertain connections



the specific response to b. thuringiensis is defined by four clusters, two up-regulated and two down-regulated groups of genes . they are enriched for eqtls in the middle of chromosome iv , which could contain known defense regulators against b. thuringiensis, the mapk genes jnk- <dig> and pmk- <dig>  <cit> , and which lies within the qtl above identified to contribute to behavioral defense against this pathogen . enriched eqtls are additionally found on the left arm of chromosome v and the right arm of the x chromosome , in both cases without a link to any known immune regulator. moreover, the upregulated clusters show an over-representation of genes involved in metabolic processes and phosphatase activity . they also include genes known to respond to the same pathogen and cadmium, as well as genes that are usually down- rather than up-regulated upon osmotic and pesticide stress . these two upregulated clusters are enriched for an ebox transcription factor binding motif and the corresponding targets . the two down-regulated clusters show an enrichment for oxidation reduction and developmental genes , genes responsive to b. thuringiensis and cadmium , and genes controlled by insulin-like signalling, including glycoproteins . one of the down-regulated clusters also shows an enrichment of the gata transcription factor targets .

taken together, the results of our enrichment analyses allow us to propose a possible mechanistic basis for the contrasting defense effects of the npr- <dig> gene. it is worth reiterating that n <dig> and the mutant only differ in the presence of a mutation in the npr- <dig> gene. therefore, the differences observed between strains must be influenced by the allelic variation in this gene. the higher resistance and avoidance behavior of n <dig> towards p. aeruginosa is likely influenced by the activation of gata and/or p <dig> mapk targets and/or the induced oxidative stress response . the situation is less clear for the response to b. thuringiensis. because n <dig> produces lower defenses against b. thuringiensis than the npr- <dig> mutant , and because any differential gene expression is repressed in the npr- <dig> mutant , the specific activation of certain genes in n <dig>  and/or the suppression of other gene groups in n <dig>  must account for the observed lower resistance and avoidance response against this pathogen. we hypothesize that this may possibly be mediated by one of the following two processes or a combination thereof :  the lower oxidative stress response in n <dig> could lead to increased susceptibility towards b. thuringiensis, in analogy to the effect recently described towards e. faecalis  <cit>  and assuming that b. thuringiensis toxicity causes oxidative stress ; and/or  an activation of metabolic processes could be disadvantageous during pathogen infection, because it may reduce availability of energetic resources that can be invested in immune defense and because metabolic products may be exploited as a source of nutrition by the pathogen. any of the other implicated functions  may also contribute to enhanced susceptibility in an as yet unknown manner. these processes then seem to be influenced by npr- <dig> through ebox-specific transcription factors. interestingly, the higher susceptibility is apparently caused by an activation of specific functions and signalling processes rather than their absence or at least reduced activity. this may indicate a sub-optimal response to this specific pathogen in the n <dig> strain or represent a consequence of pathogen-mediated manipulation of host responses, which are widespread among pathogens  <cit>  and which have also been shown for another bacillus species, bacillus nematocida, to change c. elegans behavior and intestinal responses  <cit> . at the moment, it is unclear in what way the indicated processes influence either behavioral or physiological responses or both simultaneously. this represents a challenging topic for future research.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed a complex genetic architecture comprising several epistatically interacting qtls associated with variation in c. elegans pathogen avoidance behavior. the most significant qtl encompassed the gene npr- <dig>  our functional analyses of this gene revealed a contrasting effect of npr- <dig> on c. elegans immune defense, as assessed through both behavioral and also survival phenotypes. in particular, the cb <dig> allele was associated with faster lawn leaving behavior and higher survival than the n <dig> allele on b. thuringiensis, whereas it was associated with lower lawn leaving behavior and lower survival on p. aeruginosa. a further characterization of the exact role of npr- <dig> suggested that it mediates differential regulation of defense genes via either gata transcription factors leading to increased immune defense towards p. aeruginosa or ebox transcription factors leading to decreased immune defense towards b. thuringiensis. our study thus demonstrates that a single gene in c. elegans mediates contrasting pathogen-specific defense responses.
