BACKGROUND
soybean oil consumed in the u.s. accounted for approximately 70% of the total edible fat and oil consumption in 2008; three quarters of the soybean oil was used as cooking oil and baking and frying fat . soybean oil's utilization is determined by its fatty acid composition, with commodity soybean oil typically containing 13% palmitic acid , 4% stearic acid , 20% oleic acid , 55% linoleic acid , and 8% linolenic acid . consumption of oils with high oleic acid content is desirable because this monounsaturated fatty acid not only improves shelf life but also reduces the need for hydrogenation, a process adding to the cost of the oil and generating unwanted trans-fat that has been linked to many health problems in humans  <cit> . additionally, in biodiesel production, there is also a need for oils high in oleic acid and low in saturated fatty acids in order to improve the oxidative stability while augmenting cold flow  <cit> . moreover, the enhanced oxidative stability of soybean oil with higher oleic acid content will also open up a variety of food uses and industrial applications like spraying oils or machine lubricants  <cit> .

in the lipid biosynthetic pathway, conversion of oleic acid  precursors to linoleic acid  precursors is catalysed by the delta-twelve fatty acid desaturase  <dig> enzyme   <cit> . while in arabidopsis and maize only one single copy of a fad <dig> gene was identified  <cit> , soybean appears to possess multiple copies of the gene due to the consequence of repeated rounds of genome duplication followed by limited sequence loss  <cit> . the soybean fad <dig> gene family has been previously characterized at the genome level for structure and expression  <cit> . among the fad <dig> genes identified in soybean, the fad2- <dig> desaturases consisting of fad2-2a , fad2-2b , and fad2-2c  were found to be widely expressed in the vegetative tissues of the soybean plant  <cit> . the exception was fad2-2a, for which expression was not detected; fad2-2a was predicted to be nonfunctional as it has a deletion of  <dig> bp in the coding region  <cit> . the two microsomal fad2- <dig> desaturases fad2-1a  and fad2-1b  were mainly expressed in developing seeds  <cit> . thus, fad2-1a and fad2-1b are considered to play an important role in controlling the oleic acid level in developing soybean seeds and were selected as candidate genes to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of soybean lines from the germplasm collection that contained elevated levels of oleic acid.

fad2-1a and fad2-1b are most closely related to one another, with a shared genomic organization containing a single intron and 99% identity in encoded amino acid sequence, and are present on homologous chromosome regions mapped to linkage group o  and i , respectively  <cit> . characterization of the expression of the individual soybean fad <dig> genes confirmed the importance of fad2-1a and fad2-1b with expression of these genes during peak oil synthesis; a possible role was also revealed for fad2-2c under cool temperature conditions  <cit> . differential response to temperature was also demonstrated for the soybean fad2-1a and fad2-1b enzymes expressed in yeast  <cit> . the temperature during soybean pod fill has been shown to influence the fatty acid composition of soybean oil, with cooler temperatures leading to increased oleic acid desaturation and decreased oleic acid accumulation  <cit> .

selection for breeding and genetic engineering resulting in elevated oleic acid levels were reported in many oilseed crops: safflower <cit> , sunflower  <cit> , peanut  <cit> , canola  <cit> , cotton  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . while the elevated oleic acid phenotype was often observed after a single fad <dig> gene was mutated, the very highest oleic acid phenotypes  were achieved most frequently by silencing all copies of fad <dig> genes that were expressed in developing seeds, or in particular for peanut, by combining the mutation in the active site of ahfad2a with the loss of transcription of ahfad2b  <cit> . no soybean lines exist in the usda national plant germplasm system collection with the high oleic acid trait , although multiple lines contain elevated oleic acid levels  <cit> .

several elevated oleic acid soybean lines have been characterized at the molecular level. the destruction of the fad2-1a gene by x-ray mutagenesis yielded two soybean lines with oleic acid content of approximately 50% of the oil  <cit> . a reverse genetics approach was utilized to identify a soybean line containing a missense mutation in fad2-1a that associated with an elevated oleic acid content of the oil  <cit> . many soybean lines were developed through recurrent selection that contained elevated oleic acid content such as n00- <dig>  n98-4445a, and n97-3363- <dig>  <cit> , but the genetic basis for the trait was extremely complex, with at least six qtls conditioning the phenotype  <cit> . in addition, the level of oleic acid in the oil of these soybean lines was particularly susceptible to environmental effects when compared to the x-ray fad2-1a deletion line  <cit> . no mutations in fad2-1b that associate with elevated oleic acid content have been reported to date.

suppression of fad2- <dig> gene expression by means of genetic engineering has been successful in creating soybean lines with the high oleic acid trait, with oleic acid content above 80% of the oil fraction reported and very little environmental impact on the trait  <cit> . transgenic expression of ribozyme terminated sense or antisense fad2- <dig> constructs was successful in eliminating the fad2- <dig> mrna expression signal in developing embryos and producing sirnas for the fad2- <dig> genes  <cit> . no attempt was made to distinguish between the fad2-1a and fad2-1b genes in the transgenic work, and it is also possible that the fad2- <dig> genes were targeted in the experiments  <cit> .

the objective of this work was to create the high oleic acid trait in soybeans using conventional plant breeding technology. we hypothesized that combinations of mutant alleles of the soybean fad2-1a and fad2-1b genes would greatly reduce the fad <dig> enzyme activity in developing seeds and thus result in an accumulation of oleic acid at the expense of linoleic and linolenic acid in the triacylglycerol fraction of the seed oil. we took a candidate gene approach with the fad2-1a and fad2-1b genes present in soybean germplasm accessions containing elevated levels of oleic acid in the oil. two mutant alleles of fad2-1b were identified that associated with elevated oleic acid content. in addition, mutant alleles of fad2-1a and fad2-1b were combined to create soybeans with the high oleic acid trait.

RESULTS
identification of mutant alleles of fad2-1b in soybean lines pi  <dig> and pi 567189a
in an effort to identify novel alleles of the soybean fad2-1a and fad2-1b genes, genomic dna was characterized for the sequence of both genes from plant introduction  lines selected from the national genetic resources program containing elevated oleic acid levels from  <dig> to approximately 50% percent of the oil, while commodity soybeans typically produce 19-23% oleic acid  <cit> . the fad2-1a alleles from pi  <dig> and pi  <dig> a were identical to the reference 'williams 82'  <cit>  allele. in contrast, for the fad2-1b genes from pi  <dig> and pi  <dig> a, seven common single nucelotide polymorphisms  and one unique snp for each line were identified when compared to the reference sequences from the cultivar 'williams 82' . other soybean lines were also characterized for their fad2-1b alleles, and two independent lines, pi  <dig> and pi  <dig>  contained exactly the same fad2-1b alleles as pi  <dig> and pi  <dig> a, respectively.

for the pi  <dig> fad2-1b allele, there were three missense mutations resulting in s86f, m126v, and p137r . for the pi  <dig> a fad2-1b allele, two of the missense mutations were identical , and the third missense mutation was unique, i143t. other soybean lines were identified that had fad2-1b alleles which contained different combinations of the silent mutations and the s86f and m126v missense mutations .

to predict the potential effect of the amino acid changes to soybean fad2-1b enzyme function, we used the program polyphen to analyze the potential severity of each amino acid change  <cit> . in addition, the relative amino acid conservation for each position in the enzyme was evaluated visually using weblogo after alignment of  <dig> different fad <dig> protein sequences present in the national center for biotechnology information database  <cit> . the two shared amino acid substitutions m126v and s86f each occur at a highly variable position according to the alignment in weblogo and were classified by polyphen as benign substitutions, indicating they are likely to have no phenotypic effect. for the m126v change, methionine and valine have similar chemical properties.

fad2-1b alleles that encoded only the s86f misssense mutation were identified and analyzed for the functional consequence of that isolated mutation. although serine and phenylalanine are amino acids with different chemical properties, several lines of evidence indicated that the s86f fad2-1b allele was functional, including detection of delta-twelve fatty acid desaturase activity in a yeast recombinant expression experiment and no association of the s86f fad2-1b allele variant with an elevated oleic acid phenotype .

the fad2-1b p137r mutation present in pi  <dig> represents a charge change for the substituted amino acid since proline is nonpolar while arginine is basic. at position  <dig> of wild-type fad2-1b, the proline is perfectly conserved; a proline at that position is invariant for all of the tested fad <dig> sequences represented in the protein database . in polyphen, the amino acid change was classified as probably damaging for p137r, which means that this snp is predicted to affect protein structure and/or function.

for the isoleucine present at position  <dig> of wild-type fad2-1b, other amino acids were observed in this position in the fad <dig> sequences present in the protein database, indicating that an isoleucine at position  <dig> is less conserved than the proline at the  <dig> position . however, the substitution of threonine for isoleucine at this position was not observed in the database analysis. moreover, isoleucine and threonine also have contrasting chemical properties since isoleucine is nonpolar while threonine is uncharged polar. in polyphen, the i143t amino acid change was classified as probably damaging. the conservation of amino acids in the general region of the fad2-1b p137r and i143t mutations combined with the chemical nature of the changes is suggestive of the potential deleterious effects of these mutations to the fad2-1b enzyme's structure and function.

the pi  <dig> fad2-1b allele is associated with an increase in seed oleic acid content
to test the hypothesis that the newly identified mutations in fad2-1b are causative for the elevated oleic acid level in the plant introduction lines, an analysis of the oleic acid phenotype and fad2-1b genotype association was examined for population  <dig>  an f <dig> recombinant inbred line  population developed from the cross 'jake' <cit>  × pi  <dig>  the commodity soybean line jake typically produces approximately 22% oleic acid in the seed oil and contains functional fad2-1a and fad2-1b alleles, represented as genotype fad2- <dig> aabb. pi  <dig> was selected from the germplasm collection because of elevated levels of oleic acid in the seed oil and carries the mutant fad2-1b p137r allele, represented as genotype fad2- <dig> aabb with the lowercase allele designation always specifying the mutant allele and the capital case specifying the wild-type allele. of the  <dig> lines in the ril population  <dig> that contained homozygous alleles of fad2-1b, the  <dig> lines carrying the mutant fad2-1b p137r alleles from pi  <dig> had an average of  <dig> % oleic acid, while  <dig> lines carrying wild type alleles had an average of  <dig> % oleic acid . although the variation in the data was large, the difference in oleic acid contents between the two contrasting fad2-1b genotypes was confirmed significant using student's t-test at the  <dig>  probability level .

combinations of mutations in fad2-1a and fad2-1b produce high oleic acid levels in the seed oil
we hypothesized that combining the mutant alleles of both fad2-1a and fad2-1b in one soybean line would eliminate most of the enzyme activity responsible for converting oleic acid precursors into linoleic acid precursors, and thus result in a higher oleic acid content compared to soybean lines containing mutations in either gene individually. two mutations in fad2-1a were available: the deletion of the fad2-1a gene in soybean line m <dig>   <cit>  and the missense mutation in fad2-1a from line 17d   <cit> . the identification of the two missense mutant alleles in fad2-1b from pi  <dig>  and pi 567189a  created the opportunity to evaluate the oleic acid phenotype in soybean lines containing different combinations of mutant fad2-1a and fad2-1b alleles.

an association analysis of the oleic acid phenotype and the fad2-1a and fad2-1b genotypes was performed for population  <dig>  a ril population consisting of f2: <dig> and f2: <dig> lines developed from the cross m <dig> × pi  <dig> and grown in portageville mo in  <dig>  since soybean line m <dig> contained fad2-1a Δ and wild-type alleles of fad2-1b, the genotype is herein represented as fad2- <dig> aabb with the lowercase allele designation always specifying the mutant allele and the capital case specifying the wild-type allele; likewise, the fad2- <dig> p137r genotype of pi  <dig> is represented here as fad2- <dig> aabb. individual seeds from each of  <dig> lines produced in an appropriate field environment and carrying the different homozygous combinations of fad2-1a and fad2-1b were analyzed along with the parental lines for the fatty acid phenotype of the seed oil . transgressive segregation for oleic acid content was observed for the lines that inherited the fad2- <dig> aabb and aabb genotypes, while the lines that recovered the parental fad2- <dig> genotypes contained oleic acid contents similar to the phenotype of the parental lines. lines with the genotype fad2- <dig> aabb had an average oleic acid content similar to that of a conventional soybean 'jake', which was  <dig> % of total oil content. in contrast, individuals with the genotype fad2- <dig> aabb had an average of  <dig> % oleic acid, with a very narrow standard deviation of  <dig> %. in this population, lines with either homozygous mutant fad2-1a or fad2-1b alleles had an average of  <dig> % and  <dig> % oleic acid, respectively, reiterating the relatively minor increase in oleic acid level conditioned by the fad2-1b alleles in the presence of functional fad2-1a alleles.

a similar experiment investigated the impact on seed oleic acid levels for the genetic combination of the fad2-1a Δ alleles from m <dig> with the alternate fad2-1b i143t alleles present in pi  <dig> a. for population  <dig>  a m <dig> × pi 567189a ril population, we genotyped lines based on the fatty acid profiles of f <dig> seeds harvested in costa rica, and then selected to present here the  <dig> lines classified into four homozygous combinations of fad2-1a and fad2-1b. the average oleic acid contents of the four fad2- <dig> genotypes were significantly different from each other and again demonstrated transgressive segregation . lines with fad2- <dig> genotype aabb had an average oleic acid content not statistically different from that of jake. in contrast, soybean lines with the fad2-1aabb genotype had an average of  <dig> % oleic acid. the lines that recovered the parental fad2- <dig> genotypes also recovered the respective parental oleic acid phenotype.

soybean line 17d was discovered in a reverse genetics screen for mutations in fad2-1a  <cit> . line 17d contains elevated oleic acid in the seed oil due to a fad2-1a missense mutation in a conserved amino acid referred to here as fad2-1a s117n. soybean lines which contained the fad2-1a s117n alleles consistently accumulated lower oleic acid levels in the seed oil than lines containing fad2-1a Δ alleles derived from m <dig>  and the phenotype was not stable in different environments  <cit> . we next examined the combining ability in population  <dig>  the f <dig> and f2: <dig> individuals from the cross of the fad2-1a s117n alleles derived from line 17d with the fad2-1b p137r alleles derived from pi  <dig> . homozygous fad2-1a and fad2-1b allele combinations were selected from fad2- <dig> genotyped f <dig> plants for field growth in an appropriate environment and subsequent f <dig> seed oil fatty acid phenotype determination . transgressive segregation was observed for the genotypes that inherited both the homozygous wild-type fad2- <dig> alleles and the homozygous mutant fad2- <dig> allele combinations. the fad2- <dig> aabb combination demonstrated an average oleic acid content of  <dig> %; the aabb combination displayed a typical commodity soybean oleic acid level. the parental oleic acid phenotype was recovered for the fad2- <dig> aabb genotype but not for the fad2- <dig> aabb genotype.

excess desaturase activity: a single wild-type fad2- <dig> allele prevents high oleic acid accumulation
our initial investigation of both the fad2- <dig> genotype and fatty acid phenotype in f <dig> seeds from population  <dig>  demonstrated the epistatic nature of the mutant alleles working in combination, and the results revealed that only homozygous combinations of both mutant fad2-1a and fad2-1b were capable of producing the high oleic acid phenotype. of the  <dig> f <dig> seeds that were phenotyped, there were  <dig> individual f <dig> seeds with genotype fad2- <dig> aabb, and they had an average oleic acid content of 81%, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % oleic acid . the next highest oleic acid phenotype in the set was  <dig> %, and that seed had the fad2- <dig> aabb genotype. for a two recessive gene model, one sixteenth of the individuals should inherit the phenotype; recovery of  <dig> individuals with the high oleic acid phenotype satisfies this expectation by chi-square test at the  <dig>  probability level.

individuals with a single wild-type version of either fad2-1a or fad2-1b in combination with three mutant fad2- <dig> alleles  contained approximately 40% oleic acid. no seeds from any of the other fad2- <dig> genotypes contained oleic acid levels above 49% of the seed oil. individuals with two or more wild-type fad2- <dig> alleles contained oleic acid content with a range of 18-47% of the seed oil.

the necessity of the homozygous fad2-1a and fad2-1b mutant combination requirement for the high oleic acid phenotype was confirmed in an independent analysis of fad2- <dig> genotype and fatty acid phenotype of field produced f <dig> seeds that contained homozygous fad2-1a Δ alleles but which were segregating for fad2-1b p137r alleles . while the average oleic acid level of those seeds with the fad2- <dig> aabb genotype was  <dig> %, fad2- <dig> aabb seeds averaged  <dig> %; fad2- <dig> aabb seeds averaged  <dig> % oleic acid in the seed oil. the presence of a single wild-type version of the fad2-1b allele also prevented a high oleic acid content in the seed oil, although the magnitude of the difference was greater for the f <dig> seeds from population  <dig> 

the high oleic acid phenotype is stable in plants grown in alternate environments
some of the high oleic acid soybean lines developed in this study demonstrated stability for the high oleic acid trait when grown in different environments . of the three environments, costa rica typically has the warmest temperatures during seed development, followed by the portageville, mo environment; the columbia, mo environment is the coolest of the three environments during seed development  <cit> . the differences in the oleic acid contents between environments when the fad2-1b p137r alleles were present were minor. soybean lines with genotype fad2-1aabb of population  <dig> and  <dig> produced more than 80% oleic acid content in costa rica and portageville, mo environments, and the oleic acid level was an average of 2-4% lower when grown in the columbia, mo environment. it is notable that the variation in the phenotype was narrow in all of the environments. in contrast, the fad2-1aabb soybean lines of population  <dig> containing the fad2-1b i143t alleles had lower and more variable oleic acid content in the cooler environments and failed to produce a high oleic acid phenotype in either the columbia, mo or portageville, mo environments.

full fatty acid profiles and total oil and protein content
the full fatty acid profiles of the seeds of contrasting fad2- <dig> genotypic classes produced from populations  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in this study revealed additional alterations in palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid content . as expected for a major decrease in seed expressed fad <dig> enzyme activity that results in an accumulation of oleic acid, the fad <dig> reaction products linoleic acid and linolenic acid were dramatically reduced in the high oleic fad2-1a and fad2-1b homozygous mutant lines when either of the fad2-1a mutations were present along with the fad2-1b p137r or i143t alleles.

1jake is a soybean line with normal oleic acid content and wild-type fad2-1a; m <dig> and 17d are soybean lines with mutant fad2-1aΔ and fad2-1a s117n alleles, respectively. pi  <dig> and pi 567189a are soybean lines with mutant fad2-1b p137r and fad2-1b i143t alleles, respectively. s08- <dig> is a soybean line selected from population  <dig> that inherited the mutant fad2-1b p137r alleles from pi  <dig>  2aa = wild-type fad2-1a alleles, aa = mutant fad2-1a alleles derived from m <dig> or 17d, bb = wild-type fad2-1b alleles, bb = mutant fad2-1b alleles derived from pi  <dig> or pi 567189a.

by evaluating the proportions of oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids present in the oil extracted from mature seeds, the relative in vivo fad <dig> and fad <dig> desaturase activities of the developing seeds were estimated for the contrasting homozygous fad2- <dig> genotypes from each population. the fad2- <dig> aabb genotypes contained estimated fad <dig> desaturase activities  of 76%, 76%, and 74% for population  <dig>  population  <dig>  and population  <dig>  respectively. the fad2- <dig> aabb genotypes contained fad <dig> desaturase activities of 7%, 10%, and 14%, for population  <dig>  population  <dig>  and population  <dig>  respectively. also noted is that the accumulation of linolenic acid follows a different pattern for the fad2- <dig> aabb mutant lines compared to the fad2- <dig> aabb lines, with increased estimated fad <dig> desaturase activity  for the fad2- <dig> mutant lines.

while no significant differences were observed for the stearic acid levels in the contrasting fad2- <dig> genotypes, the fad2- <dig> aabb mutant lines consistently produced lower palmitic acid levels than lines with the fad2- <dig> aabb genotype. the most dramatic change was for population  <dig>  in that case, the content of palmitic acid was  <dig> % for the fad2- <dig> aabb mutant lines compared to  <dig> % for the fad2- <dig> aabb lines.

because of the concern that improvement in fatty acid profiles might have negative impacts on the total oil and protein profiles of the seeds, we also evaluated the protein and oil contents for the field produced f2: <dig> seeds from population  <dig>  there were no significant differences in the protein or oil contents among the different homozygous fad2- <dig> genotypes, or with those lines compared to either williams  <dig> or the 17d parental line. the fad2-1b p137r allele donor parental line had a minor decrease in the average oil content and the highest mean protein content of all of the lines examined.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
increasing the oleic acid content in soybean seed oil is one of the most effective and efficient ways to enhance the nutritional value and practical utilization of soybean oil. however, the previously characterized sources of elevated oleic acid soybean involved mutation of the fad2-1a gene alone, which failed to achieve oleic acid levels stable above 60% of the oil  <cit>  or utilized approaches that have proven to have limited usage in soybean breeding due to the complexity of the trait  <cit> . a transgenic approach was successful in downregulation of the fad2- <dig> genes leading to high oleic acid levels in the oil  <cit> . we have demonstrated here that an allele of the fad2-1b gene containing a conserved amino acid substitution is responsible for the elevated oleic acid content in pi  <dig>  since soybean lines inheriting the homozygous mutant alleles have higher levels of oleic acid compared to lines inheriting wild type fad2-1b alleles. the pi 567189a fad2-1b allele, which contains a very rare amino acid substitution, was also predicted to have a negative impact on the enzyme activity and function.

the most significant finding of this research was that the mutant fad2-1b alleles from either pi  <dig> or pi 567189a not only contribute to the elevated oleic acid content in soybean seed oil of the two germplasm accessions but also enable the accumulation of oleic acid content nearly four-fold, to more than 80% of the oil, in soybean seeds when combined with different sources of a mutant fad2-1a gene. our results define the requirement of the two major contributors to the fad <dig> enzyme activity present in developing soybean seeds, fad2-1a and fad2-1b. other fad <dig> genes exist in the soybean genome and some are expressed during seed development. however, when fad2-1a and fad2-1b are non-functional, very little fad <dig> activity appeared to remain in developing seeds, as evidenced by the minor accumulation of linoleic and linolenic acid in the seed oil of the lines containing the fad2-1a and fad2-1b mutant combinations.

our study demonstrated that different types of fad2-1a mutant alleles bring about a similar high level of oleic acid content in the oil of soybean seeds when combined with the p137r fad2-1b allele from pi  <dig>  m <dig> has lost its fad2-1a alleles during the x-ray treatment while 17d carries the alleles with a mutagenesis-induced mutation that appeared to be less effective in accumulating oleic acid in the seed oil  <cit> . hence, it was assumed that 17d would be less useful than m <dig> in creating a high oleic acid trait. in contrast to what we expected, the fad2-1a alleles from 17d were able to combine with mutant fad2-1b to produce oleic acid levels similar to those when m <dig> was the source of the deleted fad2-1a gene, and the phenotype was stable across the different environments evaluated. we conclude that for the fad2-1a gene from 17d the encoded enzyme was unable to function appropriately, so when in combination with the mutant p137r fad2-1b allele, the conversion of oleic acid precursors to linoleic acid precursors was almost completely blocked. presumably there is some compensatory difference in the activity of the functional fad2-1b when the s117n allele of fad2-1a was present compared to the situation from m <dig> when fad2-1a is deleted.

the occurrence of soybean lines with the high oleic acid phenotype in population  <dig> fit a model of two independent recessive genes segregating with very little evidence for additional modifier genes, demonstrating that in this circumstance only fad2-1a and fad2-1b are contributing to the high oleic acid content in soybean seed oil. based on our results, we hypothesize that any soybean line carrying a null or severely mutated fad2-1a allele that is crossed with pi  <dig> is likely to produce individual soybean seeds in the f <dig> progeny with at least 80% oleic acid content of the seed oil.

although there is evidence of influence of temperature on the soybean seed oleic acid content  <cit> , two of our three high oleic acid soybean genotypes proved to be capable of producing a high and stable oleic acid content in three environments. moreover, there was no reduction in oil and protein content in the evaluated high oleic acid soybean lines. soybean lines with the combination of fad2-1a Δ and fad2-1b i143t alleles from population  <dig> failed to produce the high oleic acid phenotype when grown in the non-tropical environments. a possible explanation is the mutation in the fad2-1b allele of pi  <dig> a encodes at least nominal enzyme function. this explanation is supported by the fact that the i143t substitution is in a less conserved amino acid of the fad <dig> enzyme than the p137r substitution. other than that, our high oleic acid soybean lines showed a reduction of 4% at most when they were grown in the cooler environment, with a small variation in the oleic acid content. it will be necessary to test the performance of these high oleic acid soybean lines in the main north american soybean growing locations in more northern latitudes. the mutant fad2-1a and fad2-1b alleles will have to be combined in soybean lines with the appropriate maturity for those experiments to be conducted. however, based on the stability of the trait that we have observed so far, any reduction of oleic acid content due to the environment is likely to be minor because very little fad <dig> enzyme activity remains in developing seeds in the mutant fad2-1a and fad2-1b lines. an additional factor is that the end use market has not matured sufficiently to define the exact oleic acid content desired for different oil uses. another question that should be addressed is whether the trait will affect yield or other agronomic traits. it has been reported that the transgenic soybean lines with the fad2- <dig> genes being silenced did not show any yield drag or abnormal physiology characteristics  <cit> .

the relative contribution of fad2-1a and fad2-1b in oleic acid accumulation in soybean oil could not be fully explored in this study due to the lack of a true null allele of fad2-1b. previous research has indicated that fad2-1b is expressed at a higher level than fad2-1a, and that fad2-1b is more stable than fad2-1a when expressed recombinantly in yeast  <cit> . our sequencing results of fad2-1a and fad2-1b alleles from  <dig> pis with elevated oleic acid content revealed that the fad2-1a gene sequence is much more conserved than fad2-1b . if the assumption is made that the p137r allele of fad2-1b is non-functional, then the contribution of fad2-1a to the fad <dig> desaturase activity in developing seeds appears greater than that of fad2-1b, although the variability in the fatty acid profiles for the lines that contain functional versions of fad2-1a or fad2-1b obscures the contribution from each allele. if the p137r allele of fad2-1b retains some activity, then it could account for only one tenth of the original fad <dig> activity present .

traditional breeding has been used previously to produce soybean with up to 70% oleic acid content in the seed oil  <cit> . however, the phenotype is not consistent across environments, and the genetics of the trait is not very well understood, which limits the usage of these soybean lines. practices to boost oleic acid content in soybean to more than 80% have been achieved by means of suppression of the expression level of fad <dig> genes, and as a result, transgenic high oleic soybeans were produced  <cit> . commercial release of transgenic plants still has to overcome regulatory hurdles, and production and importation of transgenic plants remain unacceptable in various countries.

our research results have demonstrated the capacity to develop soybeans containing more than 80% oleic acid in the oil based on very simple genetic manipulation, the combination of two recessive genes. as part of this research, we developed molecular marker assays that allow the selection of the desired mutant fad2-1a and fad2-1b alleles, even when they are present in the heterozygous state. molecular marker selection thus eliminates the time necessary to produce an extra generation of plants that must be screened for the fatty acid phenotype. simple genetics combined with perfect molecular marker assays will make it possible for soybean breeders to quickly incorporate the high oleic acid trait in their breeding programs. the resulting high oleic acid soybean lines can then be efficiently developed and released as cultivars to producers. also, because only two genes control the vast majority of the high oleic acid phenotype, other genes may be added to enhance soybean oil quality such as low linolenic acid, low allergens, or a growing list of traits involved in soybean meal quality  <cit> . in the short term, examination of the stability of the high oleic acid soybean lines across different environments is of particular interest. also, the soybean lines with the high oleic acid trait should be used for development of soybean varieties with favorable agronomic traits including high yield.

in conclusion, this research demonstrates that when mutant alleles of fad2-1a and fad2-1b are combined together by means of traditional plant breeding, they can significantly enhance the oleic acid content of the oil, up to 80%, providing a means for the development of soybean varieties with superior oil quality.
