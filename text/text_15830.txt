BACKGROUND
the adaptation of plants to their environment and their survival under stressing conditions, e.g., pathogenic attacks, requires secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols. these molecules are broadly distributed in the plant kingdom with more than  <dig>  phenolic structures currently known, ranging from simple molecules, such as phenolic acids, to highly polymerized substances, such as tannins  <cit> . the furanocoumarins constitute one of these classes of polyphenols. despite their importance in plant life, their biosynthesis remains relatively poorly documented at the molecular level. these molecules exist mainly in  <dig> plant families: rutaceae, apiaceae, fabaceae and moraceae where they play diverse functions in plant adaptation to the environment as phytoalexins in defense systems  <cit>  or in plant-insect interactions  <cit> . these molecules also display remarkable physicochemical properties, making them potentially toxics. they can interfere in enzymatic reactions through the inhibition of cytochrome p <dig>  enzymatic activities  <cit> . they also interact with nucleic acids through the photocycloaddition of pyrimidic bases  <cit> . these characteristics make furanocoumarins attractive candidates for therapeutic use. for example, furanocoumarin derivatives have been used for decades as treatments for skin diseases, such as psoriasis and vitiligo  <cit> . in addition, there are other applications for furanocoumarins in various therapeutic fields, such as the symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis  <cit> , photochemotherapy of t cell lymphoma  <cit> , or chemotherapy of multidrug-resistant tumors  <cit> . thus, it would be beneficial to increase the production of furanocoumarins in plants to match pharmaceutical demand. to reach this goal, it is essential to understand the biosynthetic pathway of furanocoumarins, and to determine how the production of these molecules could be enhanced.

furanocoumarin-producing plants are not model plants for the scientific community. therefore, little is known about their genomes and the genes that encode the enzymes involved in their biosynthetic pathways. only four genes have been functionnaly characterized so far. two p450s, psoralen synthase and angelicin synthase, have been described and are specifically involved in the synthesis of these molecules. these synthases catalyze the transformation of marmesin and colombianetin in psoralen and angelicin, respectively  <cit> . another study reported the identification and the characterization of a o-methyl transferase in ammi majus that catalyzes the transformation of bergaptol into bergapten  <cit> . finally, a fe2+/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase was recently identified in ruta graveolens, which is able to metabolize p-coumaroyl coa leading to the synthesis of umbelliferone, the immediate precursor of furanocoumarins  <cit> .

cyp98a  are enzymes belonging to the cytochrome p <dig> family that catalyze the meta-hydroxylation of p-coumarate derivatives, an important step in the phenylpropanoid pathway . this meta-hydroxylation is not operating on free p-coumaric acid, but on p-coumarate esterified with shikimic, quinic, tyramine or phenyllactic acids  <cit> . in most of the studies, these enzymes showed preferential affinity for the 5-o-shikimate and 5-o-d-quinate esters of transp-coumaric acid  <cit> , however 4-coumaroyl-3’, 4’-dihydroxyphenyllactate and p-coumaroyl tyramine are also precursor molecules that form rosmarinic acid and caffeoyltyramine, respectively  <cit> . recently, another study demonstrated a complex process of evolution of the cyp98a family to acquire new functions implicated in the mechanism of pollen development in plants  <cit> . other studies have assigned roles for these enzymes in the response of the plants to various molecules, such as salicylic acid derivatives and isonicotinic acids  <cit> , and the expression level of the corresponding genes is highly increased after uv-c treatment  <cit> . therefore, the cyp98a subfamily plays a major role in the phenylpropanoid pathway, and its action is not limited to the direct synthesis of caffeoyl ester derivatives but has a larger impact on plant metabolism. 

in the present work, we describe the identification and in vitro/in vivo enzymatic characterization of a new gene encoding cyp98a <dig>  a p-coumaroyl ester 3'-hydroxylase from r. graveolens, which constitutes the first cyp <dig> characterized from a furanocoumarin-producing plant. the biochemical characterization was assayed in  <dig> different systems: i) heterologous expression in yeast using the galactose-inducible strain pyedp60/wat <dig>  ii) heterologous transient expression in the leaves of n. benthamiana together with the tbsv p19-silencing suppressor, and iii) stable expression in r. graveolens plants. our results clearly show that cyp98a <dig> preferentially hydroxylates p-coumaroyl quinate to a greater extent than p-coumaroyl shikimate and, therefore seems to be involved in chlorogenic acid metabolism. leaf exposure to uv-b light and further analyses of the expression level of cyp98a <dig> revealed an increased cyp98a <dig> mrna accumulation. finally, the analyses of the coumarin and furanocoumarin extracted from transgenic r. graveolens overexpressing cyp98a <dig> or cyp98a <dig> clearly showed an increase in the concentration of furanocoumarins in both cases whereas the accumulation scopoletin could only be observed for the cyp98a <dig> plants. therefore, the work described here demonstrates that cyp98a <dig> can be used as a tool to modulate the furanocoumarins content in r. graveolens.

RESULTS
identification of a cyp98a orthologous gene in r. graveolens
to identify cyp98a genes present in furanocoumarin-producing plants, we used a pcr-based approach and the codehop strategy described by morant et al.  <cit> . first, we focused on the identification of genes belonging to the cyp98a subfamily. to achieve this, we performed an alignment of  <dig> sequences of cyp98a available in databases which allowed us to identify two peptidic consensus domains  and define degenerated primers. the pcr reactions were performed on genomic dna extracted from young r. graveolens seedlings. a dna fragment of  <dig> nucleotides corresponding to the internal sequence of a gene encoding a cytochrome p <dig> was amplified and subsequently cloned. a genbank homology search using the blast tool showed 89% identity at the amino acid level with a c3'h isolated from ocinum basilicum . the corresponding full length open reading frame was isolated by using pcr conducted on a smart cdna library produced from rna extracted from the leaves of young r. graveolens seedlings  <cit>  as described in material and methods. the resulting sequence  was  <dig> bp long and encoded for a  <dig> amino acid protein, which displayed 81% identity with the arabidopsis cyp98a <dig> 

in vitro biochemical characterization of cyp98a22
to characterize the activity of cyp98a <dig>  the open reading frame was cloned into the pyedp <dig> plasmid and expressed in the saccharomyces cerevisae wat <dig> strain as described by larbat and collaborators  <cit> . the p <dig> functional expression was determined at  <dig> nm using a co differential spectrum. unfortunately, for the yeast expressing cyp98a <dig>  no peak could be detected with microsomes prepared from cells grown in conventional or modified culture conditions . despite undetectable levels of expression, incubations were performed using the substrates previously described for the enzymes of this p <dig> family. we were unable to detect any significant activity using hplc-dad measurements with p-coumaroyl quinate, p-coumaroyl shikimate, p-coumaroyl tyramine and p-tricoumaroyl spermidine as substrates. in parallel, microsomes prepared from yeast expressing cyp98a <dig> were perfectly functional and consistent with the results described elsewhere, which showed that the preparation of microsomes was efficient.

the absence of cyp98a <dig> activity in the yeast expression system led us to produce the protein in another heterologous expression system, i.e. nicotiana benthamiana, using a modified protocol of voinnet et al. <cit> . in an initial attempt to monitor the expression of the corresponding proteins, the yfp protein was fused to the c terminus of the gene encoding cyp98a <dig>  the recombinant coding sequence was cloned into the binary plasmid pbin-gw  <cit>  and introduced into a lba <dig> agrobacterium tumefaciens strain  <cit> . young leaves of n. benthamiana were infiltrated with a. tumefaciens lba <dig> which was transformed with either pbin-cyp98a22-yfp or the empty pbin plasmid. the coinfiltration was performed along with agrobacterium transformed with pbin61-p <dig>  a strong fluorescence signal was observed at the endoplasmic reticulum level in the case of the coexpression of p <dig> and cyp98a22-yfp , whereas no signal could be detected with the control empty plasmid . these experiments demonstrated that n. benthamiana was an effective system for the expression of cyp98a <dig>  

to assess the function of cyp98a <dig>  a second set of experiments was conducted using a recombinant pbin plasmid containing cyp98a <dig> as a single sequence . the agrobacteria transformed with this plasmid were coinfiltrated into n. benthamiana leaves along with recombinant a. tumefaciens containing pbin61-p <dig>  in parallel, as two independent controls, the inoculation of separate plants was performed with a. tumefaciens transformed with pbin-cyp98a <dig> or with the pbin-gw void plasmid. four days post-inoculation, microsomes were prepared from the infiltrated n. benthamiana leaves as described in the material and methods section. these microsomes were tested for in vitro enzymatic activity with 100μm of various potential substrates, i.e., p-coumaroyl shikimate, p-coumaroyl quinate, p-tricoumaroyl spermidine or p-coumaroyl tyramine. for both proteins , no metabolisation could be detected in the presence of p-tricoumaroyl spermidine or p-coumaroyl tyramine but p-coumaroyl shikimate and p-coumaroyl quinate, were transformed in two products that shared similar retention time and uv spectrum than caffeoyl shikimate and caffeoyl quinate standards, respectively. the identity of the caffeoyl products was confirmed using lc/ms analyses . no metabolization of any substrate was observed when the infiltration was performed with the void plasmid showing that the expression level of the endogenous cyp98a from n. benthamiana was not high enough to be taken into account. the vi/km and apparent km kinetic parameters were determined for cyp98a <dig> by titration of the product formed using mass spectrometry. results showed a higher apparent affinity  as well as a higher catalytic efficiency  for p-coumaroyl quinate than for p-coumaroyl shikimate .

reactions were carried out at 28°c during  <dig> min in a kpi buffer 20mm ph  <dig>  as described in material and methods. reactions were stopped with addition of  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid. data obtained were fitted with the michaelis-menten equation.

in planta biochemical characterization of cyp98a22
a first series of phytochemical investigations  were achieved on wild type leaves of n. benthamiana and revealed that these tissues contain a significant pool of p-coumaroyl shikimate and quinate. thus, we assumed that in planta functional characterization of cyp98a <dig> could be examined following transient expression in epidermal cells, because the potential substrates of this enzyme were present. this type of approach has  <dig> main advantages: the accuracy of the in vitro results can be demonstrated and the risk of the loss of enzymatic activity during the protein purification process is reduced. to this end, we infiltrated n. benthamiana leaves with recombinant a. tumefaciens containing pbin35s::cyp98a <dig>  pbin35s::cyp98a <dig> or an empty pbin-gw vector. all infiltrations were analyzed along with agrobacterium containing pbin61-p <dig>  the lc/ms analyses of the extracts prepared four days post-infiltration showed an increase of chlorogenic acid and caffeoyl shikimate derivatives when any cyp98a was transiently overexpressed . when comparing the accumulation of each molecule in relation with the overexpression of cyp98a <dig> or cyp98a <dig>  we observed that cyp98a <dig> is more efficient for the production of chlorogenic acid  whereas cyp98a <dig> seems to be more dedicated to the synthesis of caffeoyl shikimate  these results are consistent with those obtained for the in vitro characterization in the plant microsomes and shows that cyp98a <dig> is more specific for p-coumaroyl quinate .

over-expression of cyp98a <dig> in r. graveolens
to establish a link between cyp98a <dig> and/or cyp98a <dig> and the synthesis of coumarins or furanocoumarins, transgenic r. graveolens were generated which overexpressed the corresponding gene. the same recombinant a. tumefaciens strains, used for transient expression in n. benthamiana, were used for stable transformation . the transformation protocol was performed as described by lièvre et al. <cit> . four 35s:cyp98a <dig> and nine 35s:cyp98a <dig> plants were generated and characterized at the molecular level using pcr directed against the 35s- cyp98a <dig>  and the cyp98a <dig> sequences. for each plant, the samples were divided into two halves. the first half was used to perform an rna extraction to confirm the expression level of the transgenes using real-time pcr. the second half was used to extract phenolic molecules, which were further analyzed using hplc. these analyses were compared with a set of extractions from wild-type plants. the content of scopoletin, umbelliferone and the three major furanocoumarins  present in r. graveolens was analyzed. for the 35s:cyp98a <dig> plants , an increase in the concentration of scopoletin and umbelliferone could be observed . for the 35s::cyp98a <dig>  plants, no impact was observed for the production of scopoletin whereas an important decrease of umbelliferone  could be highlighted. moreover, in both cases, the results showed a statistically significant increase in the furanocoumarin content , and  <dig>  times increase for the 35s:cyp98a <dig> plants ) . 

tissue-specific expression pattern of cyp98a <dig> in r. graveolens
total rna was extracted from various organs of 3-month-old r. graveolens plants  and was used to establish the relative expression pattern of cyp98a <dig> using a real-time pcr approach. two sets of primers were selected for the quantification of cyp98a <dig> mrna, and the two probes gave similar results. the results showed a broad expression pattern of the mrna . indeed, mrna was detected in all the tissues tested and was not restricted to lignified tissues. the results showed that the expression level is highest in the roots and petals and is also significantly high in the petioles and pistil. for the stems, leaves and seeds, the expression was much lower.

uv-b treatment of r. graveolens
as described by different authors  <cit> , the biosynthesis of furanocoumarins in r. graveolens plants can be enhanced through exposure to uv-b radiations. after a 24-hour exposure to uv-b light , the leaves, stems, petioles and roots of r. graveolens plants were collected and both total rna and furanocoumarins were extracted. as a control, the same extractions were performed on non-uv-treated plants. the lc-ms quantification was conducted for bergapten, xanthotoxin, psoralen, marmesin and umbelliferone in the treated and nontreated plants. the results showed a  <dig> -fold increase of umbelliferone content in the uv-treated plants  compared to the control plants  as described in vialart et al. <cit> . concerning other molecules, no statistically difference could be demonstrated. real-time pcr experiments were performed on the same set of material as published in vialart et al. the expression of cyp98a <dig> was significantly stimulated in the uv-treated leaves , whereas no statistically significant change was observed in the petioles, stems or roots .

discussion
the function of the p <dig> cyp98a gene subfamily has been extensively discussed in the literature for over  <dig> years. more than  <dig> different genes have been sequenced and referenced in the international p <dig> database  as belonging to this subfamily. various functions have been attributed to these proteins. their activity is classically described as a c3’h catalyzing hydroxylation in the 3' position of p-coumaroyl shikimate and p-coumaroyl quinate  <cit> . however, other substrates have also been described, such as 4-p-coumaroyl-3' 4'-dihydroxyphenyllactate  <cit> , p-coumaroyl tyramine  <cit>  or spermidine esters  <cit> . among the enzymes that metabolize p-coumaroyl shikimate, some were demonstrated to hydroxylate p-coumaroyl quinate at a lower rate and efficiency  <cit> , while others were simply unable to metabolize both substrates  <cit> . in some cases, these enzymes have been described as having a larger effect on metabolism. for instance, schoch and collaborators  <cit>  indicated that the presence of c3’h is necessary for the biosynthesis of many divergent compounds such as, lignins, uv-absorbing pigments, antioxidants, flavors, fragrances and coumarins. together, all these data show that this enzyme plays a central  and pivotal role in the phenylpropanoid pathway and that it has an indirect impact on the synthesis of several molecules. in this work, we hypothesized that an orthologous gene isolated from a furanocoumarin-producing plant might have impact the synthesis of some of these molecules and play an important role in the answer to various stresses.

little is known concerning the genome of r. graveolens, a furanocoumarin-producing plant. only a few accessions  are available in the nucleic acid or protein databases, and no information concerning a putative gene corresponding to a cyp98a orthologous gene was found. however, each p <dig> subfamily shares several conserved consensus domains which makes it possible to use sequence-based pcr approaches for cloning and identifying plant cytochrome p <dig> genes. accordingly, we used a pcr approach with degenerated primers  <cit>  to isolate a gene from the r. graveolens genome that potentially encodes a c3’h. the translational product of the resulting open reading frame , cyp98a <dig> , was compared with  <dig> peptidic sequences available in the databases. the results showed that the protein is clustering with enzymes described as classical c3’h involved in the synthesis of lignin precursor, among which the first c3’h cyp98a <dig> ever functionally described and not with divergent cyp <dig> as the arabidopsis thaliana cyp98a <dig> and cyp98a <dig> which are involved in the synthesis of n10-monosinapoyl-n <dig> n5-dihydroxyferuloyl spermidine, an important constituent of pollen  <cit> . this first set of data seemed to indicate that this enzyme might be a conventional c3’h that potentially metabolized p-coumaroyl quinate and p-coumaroyl shikimate.

the biochemical characterization of plant cytochrome p450s using a yeast expression system  <cit>  is often difficult due to the low abundance and instability of these membrane-bound proteins. thus, several different heterologous systems for the expression of the p450s, including yeast, e. coli and baculovirus, have been described in the literature. to perform the enzymatic characterization of cyp98a <dig>  we selected the yeast expression system described by pompon and collaborators  <cit>  which is extensively used for the heterologous expression and characterization of enzymatic activities of proteins belonging to the p <dig> family. this system is efficient for the production of certain enzymes  <cit>  but was limited for the production of other plant enzymes. various improvements have been proposed in the literature, including changes in the media and culture conditions  <cit> , the modification or exchange of nucleotide sequences   <cit>  or the replacement of the membrane anchor  <cit>  <cit> . a carbon monoxide differential spectrum is generally performed to assess the expression level of p <dig> in such a system. to achieve the expression of cyp98a <dig>  several of these strategies were employed. although no peak at  <dig> nm could be observed with a co spectrum for any strategy tested, we used the prepared microsomes to conduct metabolisation tests using the following substrates: p-coumaroyl quinate, p-coumaroyl shikimate, p-coumaroyl tyramine, and p-tricoumaroyl spermidine. no transformation of any substrate could be detected, whereas the metabolisation of p-coumaroyl quinate and shikimate was observed in the presence of cyp98a <dig> yeast microsomes. this lack of expression could not been explained so far but led us to move to another protein heterologous expression system.

to determine the activity of cyp98a <dig>  we used n. benthamiana as an alternative heterologous expression system. the transient transformation of the plant petals with cytochrome p450s using particle bombardment as a technique for transferring a t-dna has been described in the literature  <cit> . the use of this system has also been reported for the functional characterization of a p <dig> belonging to the cyp71a subfamily involved in the biosynthetic pathway of alkaloid phytoalexins  <cit> .

to test the efficiency of this plant heterologous expression system to allow the expression of cyp98a <dig>  we first constructed a fusion protein comprising cyp98a <dig> and the yellow fluorescent protein . this recombinant orf was placed under the control of the camv 35s promoter and agroinfiltrated in the epidermal cells of n. benthamiana. because no fluorescence could be observed, a second set of infiltrations was performed in the presence of a plasmid allowing the expression of the tomato bushy stunt virus silencing suppressor protein p <dig> as described by voinnet et al. <cit> . in this case, the analyses of the infiltrated leaves revealed a strong fluorescence signal localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. this result is consistent with the work of ro and collaborators who demonstrated that the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase , a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway, is bound in the er membrane  <cit> . our results show that this plant system is efficient for the functional expression of cyp98a <dig> in the presence of the gene silencing suppressor protein.

to realize the functional characterization of the enzyme, a new set of plasmids were constructed containing the orf of cyp98aa <dig> and cyp98a <dig> under the control of the 35s promoter in the pbin vector prior to agroinfiltration to n. benthamiana in the presence of tbsv p <dig>  as a first attempt, we prepared microsomes from the leaves at  <dig> days post-infiltration, and the enzymatic tests showed that both p-coumaroyl quinate and p-coumaroyl shikimate were hydroxylated to their caffeic counterparts by cyp98a <dig> and cyp98a <dig>  however, cyp98a <dig> showed a much higher efficiency with p-coumaroyl quinate as a substrate than with p-coumaroyl shikimate, whereas cyp98a <dig> seems to preferentially metabolize p-coumaroyl shikimate. this first experiment revealed that the n. benthamiana plant system is a more efficient tool for the expression and the in vitro characterization of cyp98a <dig> than the yeast system. the use of this plant heterologous system for the expression of cyp98a <dig> also provides a rapid method to test the in vivo activity of the concerned protein. in addition to a pool of p-coumaroyl esters of quinate and shikimate, the dominant phenylpropanoids of tobacco is chlorogenic acid  <cit> . the presence of these molecules in plants provides an interesting tool to determine the activity of the overexpressed cyp98a enzymes and to highlight the natural function of these enzymes. the analysis of the metabolic profile and the quantification of chlorogenic and caffeoyl shikimic acid were performed on leaves infiltrated with recombinant agrobacteria containing pbin-cyp98a <dig> and on non-infiltrated leaves. the results showed a statistically significant increase of the chlorogenic acid content.

to complete this study, we examined the tissue-specific expression pattern using real-time pcr. indeed, as discussed above, most of the members of the cyp98a p <dig> subfamily catalyze efficient 3’-hydroxylation of p-coumaroyl shikimate and much slower synthesis of caffeoyl quinate  <cit> . because the hydroxylation of p-coumaroyl-shikimate is a key step in the formation of the monolignol lignin precursor, this observed activity, along with the relatively high level of expression of most of the described c3’h in stem and vascular bundles, indicates that these genes play an important role in lignification  <cit> . the results we obtained in our investigation concerning the expression pattern of cyp98a <dig> were somewhat different. unlike other c3’h, cyp98a <dig> displays a broad expression pattern. strong expression was observed in the petals and roots, whereas a relatively weak expression was observed in the petioles, stems and pistils.

together, these results show that even if cyp98a <dig> is phylogenetically related to cyp98a <dig>  it might play a more complex or, at least, a different role in planta. indeed, caffeoyl shikimate plays an important role in lignification, while the caffeoyl quinate derivatives, such as chlorogenic acid, are described as growth regulators, disease resistance factors, antioxidants and compounds affecting the organoleptic quality of fruits  <cit> . the ability of cyp98a <dig> to be more dedicated to the synthesis of chlorogenic acid constitutes an evidence of its involvement in the stress response.

to explore this hypothesis, plantlets were exposed to uv-b light for  <dig> hours as described by vialart et al. <cit> . altough the analysis of the furanocoumarin content showed no increase in comparison with the non-treated plants, the uv-b elicitation stimulated the synthesis of umbelliferone, which is a precursor of this pathway. moreover, these analyses demonstrated that the expression level of cyp98a <dig> gene was strongly increased  in uv-treated leaves as compared with non-treated leaves. recently, the elicitation experiments were utilized in cynara cardunculus to induce the expression of cyp98a <dig> using uv-c light  <cit> . although this does not provide irrefutable evidence, these elements are consistent with the hypothesis that cyp98a <dig> is involved in responses against several stresses in r. graveolens. these preliminary results must now be explored in depth.

scopoletin is an important defense compound ubiquitously found in higher plants for which two biosynthetic routes have been described . a first route, operating through feruloyl-coa was demonstrated by kai and collaborators  <cit>  in arabidopsis, which implies the conversion of p-coumaroyl-shikimic acid into caffeoyl-shikimic acid by cyp98a <dig>  upstream to feruloyl-coa  <cit> . scopoletin content was dramatically decreased in knock-out cyp98a <dig> mutants, confirming the role of the arabidopsis c3’h in the synthesis of this compound. an alternate route to scopoletin was proposed in plants such as daphne mezereum l  <cit>  and agathosma puberula <cit>  where umbelliferone and esculetin are the direct precursors of scopoletin. it is unestablished in r. graveolens if the two pathways are coexisting or if only one of the two is prevalently operating. to assess the involvement of cyp98a enzymes in the synthesis of scopoletin in r. graveolens, transgenic ruta plants overexpressing either cyp98a <dig> or cyp98a <dig> where generated. the analysis done on the in vitro plants highlighted a statistically significant increase of the scopoletin content in 35s::cyp98a <dig> plants whereas plants overexpressing cyp98a <dig> did not show any modification in scopoletin content when compared to control plants. the results obtained on cyp98a <dig> are consistent with the findings of kay et al. <cit>  who described the key-role of c3’h in the synthesis of scopoletin in arabidopsis. in parrallel, the results obtained on cyp98a <dig> fit well with our in vitro investigations obtained with n. benthamiana, which demonstrate the preferential role of this enzyme in the synthesis of chlorogenic acid vs caffeoyl-shikimate, the precursor of scopoletin in the first biosynthetic route described above. the analyses were extended to other coumarin which led us to show that the overexpression of both cyp98a impact significantly the concentration of furanocoumarins in transgenic plants. this constitute an unexpected result because c3’h is not directly involved into the synthesis of furanocoumarins . the exact reason for this increase in furanocoumarin content remains unknowned and will require further metabolomic investigations to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
the results described in this work showed that members of the cyp98a family, even if sharing high sequence homologies, don’t have the same function in all the plants. indeed, cyp98a <dig> seems to be more dedicated to the synthesis of chlorogenic acid in r. graveolens. as mentioned previously, furanocoumarins are molecules of pharmaceutical interest for humans. in planta, these molecules have been described in plant defense against phytophageous insect attacks. the selection of plants synthesizing higher amounts of these molecules would be useful to facilitate their production. according to our results, cyp98a <dig> is a good candidate for this purpose: it has an impact on the synthesis of furanocoumarins in r. graveolens. these properties can be used in a metabolic engineering strategy to enhance the production of molecules of therapeutic interest. this work also confirms that the study of metabolic networks opens a wide field of investigation for the production of plants of interest for pharmaceutical applications.
