BACKGROUND
metabotropic glutamate receptors  are important mediators of learning and excitability  <cit> , sensory signal transduction  <cit> , and central information processing that play a critical role in many physiological and pathological processes  <cit> . the group i mglurs, which includes mglur <dig> and  <dig>  exhibit widespread expression in the central nervous system where they are generally expressed postsynaptically in addition to their dendro-somatic localization, where they can initiate some forms of plasticity and regulate neuronal excitability, respectively  <cit> . mglur <dig> and  <dig> are similar in sequence, g protein coupling and in their responses to many pharmacological compounds. while their expression profiles in the brain are distinct, mglur <dig> and  <dig> serve analogous roles in different regions. for example, hippocampal mglur <dig> localized near the postsynaptic density can initiate a form of long term depression   <cit> . likewise, postsynaptic mglur <dig> in the cerebellum can also produce mglur-ltd  <cit> . in both cases, initiation of plasticity requires coupling to gq/ <dig> proteins and post-synaptic localization, although the mechanistic details of each phenomena are distinct. further, both mglur <dig> and  <dig> can couple to modulation of voltage gated calcium and other ion channels in several neuronal cell types  <cit> , leading to changes in cell excitability.

our understanding of the role of these receptors derives in large part from the pharmacological tools used to manipulate their function. in recent years, many highly selective compounds have been developed that target mglurs at allosteric sites, separate from the endogenous glutamate ligand binding site. fewer highly selective orthosteric compounds are available. one exception is the compound 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine , an orthosteric ligand that has been used extensively as a selective mglur <dig> agonist  <cit> . at least one report indicates that chpg is selective for mglur <dig> over even the closely related mglur <dig>  making it the only known orthosteric agonist with such selectivity  <cit> . however, the selectivity of chpg for mglur <dig> over mglur <dig> has not been subsequently tested, to my knowledge.

here, selectivity of chpg was examined by testing its ability to activate specific mglurs expressed by intranuclear cdna injection in sympathetic neurons from the rat superior cervical ganglion , a primary neuronal cell with a null mglur background  <cit> . modulation of the native voltage-dependent calcium currents in scg neurons was used as an assay for heterologously expressed mglurs. the ability of a range of concentrations of chpg to activate mglur <dig>  mglur <dig>  mglur <dig>  and two splice variants of mglur <dig>  was tested. consistent with previous reports in the literature, we found that chpg functioned as a full agonist at mglur <dig> and failed to activate mglur <dig>  or mglur <dig>  surprisingly however, chpg also functioned as a full agonist at both mglur1a and mglur1b with similar potency as mglur <dig> 

methods
cell isolation, dna injection and plasmids
a description of cell isolation and cdna injection is found elsewhere  <cit> . animal protocols were approved by the university committee on animal resources . briefly, scgs were removed from adult male wistar rats  after co <dig> euthanasia and decapitation, then incubated in earle’s balanced salt solution  containing  <dig>  mg/ml trypsin  &  <dig>  mg/ml collagenase d  for  <dig> min at 35°c. cells were transferred to minimum essential medium , plated on poly-l-lysine  coated culture dishes and incubated at 37°c for 2– <dig> hours before cdna injection. injected cells were incubated overnight at 37°c  and patch clamp experiments were performed the next day.

injection of cdna was performed with an eppendorf  <dig> microinjector and injectman ni  <dig> micromanipulator  3– <dig> hours following cell isolation. injection electrodes were made with a sutter p- <dig> horizontal electrode puller  from thin-walled, borosilicate glass . plasmids were stored at −20°c as a  <dig>  - 1 μg/μl stock solution in te buffer . all mglur constructs were injected at 100–130 ng μl- <dig> . the mglur <dig> clone was provided by d. hampson . all neurons were co-injected with “enhanced” green fluorescent protein cdna  for identification of successfully injected cells.

all constructs were sequence confirmed. pcr products were purified with qiagen  silica membrane spin columns prior to restriction digestion and ligation. midipreps were prepared using qiagen anion exchange columns, and amplified in either top <dig> or dh5α e. coli. .

electrophysiology and data analysis
pipettes for patch-clamp experiments were made with a sutter p- <dig> horizontal puller from  <dig> glass  and had resistances of 1– <dig> mΩ. series resistances were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mΩ  prior to electronic compensation of 80%. whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made with an epc- <dig> patch clamp amplifier . voltage protocol generation and data acquisition were performed using custom software  on a macintosh g <dig> computer  with an instrutech  itc- <dig> data acquisition board. currents were low-pass filtered at 3 khz using the 4-pole bessel filter in the patch clamp amplifiers, digitized at 2–5 khz and stored on the computer for later analysis. experiments were performed at 21–24°c . patch-clamp data analysis was performed using the igor pro software package .

the external  recording solution contained :  <dig> tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane,  <dig> 4--1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid ,  <dig> glucose,  <dig> cacl <dig>  and  <dig>  tetrodotoxin , ph  <dig> . the internal  solution contained: 120 n-methyl-d-glucamine  methanesulfonate,  <dig> tea,  <dig> egta,  <dig> hepes,  <dig> sucrose,  <dig> cacl <dig>   <dig> mgatp,  <dig>  na2gtp, and  <dig> tris creatine phosphate, ph  <dig> . l-glutamate  was used as the agonist for mglurs. chpg was obtained from two sources: tocris bioscience  and ascent scientific . all drugs and control solutions were applied to cells using a custom, gravity-driven perfusion system positioned ~100 μm from the cell, allowing rapid solution exchange . the degree of calcium current inhibition was calculated as the maximum current inhibition in the presence of drug compared to the last current measurement prior to drug application.

RESULTS
chpg activates mglur5
to confirm the utility of chpg as an agonist of mglur <dig>  and to estimate its efficacy and potency in our system, isolated scg neurons were intranuclearly injected with cdna encoding rat mglur5b, and the amplitude of calcium currents was monitored using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique upon application of multiple concentrations of chpg and l-glutamate  . currents were monitored during a 25 msec test pulse to +10 mv from a holding potential of −80 mv , near the peak of the current–voltage  curve. chpg application produced a dose-dependent, reversible inhibition of the calcium current, as illustrated in the representative current amplitude time course shown in figure 1a. at saturating concentrations the chpg effect was similar to the inhibition produced with glu . figure 1b shows the average  current inhibition by chpg at each concentration. a fit of these data to the hill equation {% inhibition = emax/} is also shown, yielding an ec <dig> value of 57 μm. these data are consistent with those reported in the literature and confirm that chpg acts as an agonist at mglur <dig> with an ec <dig> value in the mid to high μm range.

effect of chpg on other mglurs
the specificity of chpg was tested by examining its effect on calcium currents in neurons expressing either mglur <dig>  mglur <dig>  mglur1a or mglur1b. scg neurons expressing either mglur <dig> or mglur <dig>  group ii and iii mglurs, respectively, which couple exclusively to gi/o proteins and with greater sequence divergence from mglur <dig> , were exposed to 100 μm glu and 1 mm chpg. all of the mglur2-expressing cells examined showed strong glu-dependent calcium current inhibition , confirming expression of the receptor . however, none of these cells exhibited detectable current modulation upon application of 1 mm chpg . likewise, scg neurons expressing mglur <dig> were inhibited 20 ± 4%  by 100 μm glu, but unaffected by 1 mm chpg . these data confirm that chpg is not an agonist at mglur <dig> or  <dig> 

the effects of chpg were further tested on scg neurons expressing either mglur1a or a similar splice variant, mglur1b. surprisingly, strong chpg-mediated calcium current modulation was observed in neurons expressing both mglur1a and mglur1b . figure 3a illustrates the time course of inhibition in one scg neuron expressing mglur1a upon application of 100 μm glu and several concentrations of chpg . the inset in figure 3a shows sample currents from the same cell illustrating a control  current, and current inhibited by 3 mm chpg. figure 3b illustrates the average  chpg effect at four different concentrations from  <dig> scg neurons expressing mglur1a and  <dig> cells expressing mglur1b. the data were fit to the hill equation , which indicated an ec <dig> value of 80 μm for mglur1a and 39 μm for mglur1b, both values similar to that observed with mglur <dig> . these data suggest that while chpg shows strong selectivity for group i mglurs over mglur <dig> and  <dig>  it appears to activate mglur <dig> with similar potency as its known target, mglur <dig> 

efficacy of chpg on mglur <dig> and mglur1
to compare the efficacy of chpg on mglur <dig> with the mglur <dig> variants, the responses  to each concentration of chpg were normalized to the response to 100 μm glu in the same cell. these normalized chpg responses were then averaged and plotted in figure  <dig>  because 100 μm glu is a saturating concentration of the natural ligand  of mglurs, a saturating response of  <dig> in this plot is indicative of full agonism. each of these data sets were fit to the hill equation and responses to mglur <dig>  mglur1a, and mglur1b reached a maximal response of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , respectively. these data suggest that chpg acts as a full agonist at mglur <dig>  mglur1a and mglur1b. note that the number of cells in the mglur <dig> data set was somewhat smaller than in figure  <dig>  because only cells to which 100 μm glu was applied could be analyzed in this way.

to further verify the action of chpg on these receptors, calcium current inhibitory responses of scg neurons to 1 mm chpg were examined in cells expressing either mglur5b or 1a in the absence and presence of the selective mglur <dig> inhibitor mpep and the selective mglur <dig> inhibitor ly <dig>  the results of those experiments are shown in figure  <dig>  in six mglur5b expressing cells, 1 mm chpg produced an average inhibition of the calcium currents of 37 ± 4% when applied alone. in the presence of 1 μm mpep, chpg produced only 5 ± 2% inhibition, as expected. when chpg was applied in the presence of 50 μm ly <dig>  chpg inhibited the current by 37 ± 3%, an effect indistinguishable from that when chpg was applied alone. in five mglur1a expressing cells, chpg produced a 45 ± 7% inhibition when applied alone, and 45 ± 8% and 9 ± 3% in the presence of mpep and ly <dig>  respectively. these results confirm that chpg is indeed acting through the heterologously expressed receptor in both mglur <dig> and mglur <dig> expressing scg neurons, and are thus inconsistent with the plausible explanation that native mglur <dig> might be upregulated in scg neurons when mglur <dig> is expressed heterologously.

chpg shows weak biased agonist properties when acting on mglur <dig> but not mglur5
a potential explanation for the discrepancy between the data presented here, showing chpg acting as an mglur <dig> agonist, and that in the established literature suggesting that chpg is selective for mglur <dig> over mglur <dig>  may be that chpg acts as a biased agonist on mglur <dig>  this is possible because although the group i mglurs  are generally considered to be gq-coupled receptors, they are in fact dual coupled, activating gq/ <dig> and gi/o in many neurons  <cit> , or gq/ <dig> and gs in some heterologous expression systems  <cit> . as such it is possible that mglur <dig> agonism was missed in earlier studies, since many of these used fluorescent calcium indicators to detect mglur-induced rises in intracellular calcium as an assay for mglur <dig> and mglur <dig> function, which depends exclusively on gq/ <dig> activation. if chpg functions as a biased agonist on mglur <dig>  producing activation of only the gi/o pathway, this activity would have been missed. to assess whether chpg could activate gq/ <dig> as effectively as glu in cells expressing mglur5b or mglur1a, modulation of the native m-type potassium currents in scg neurons was examined. m-currents are non-inactivating, voltage-dependent potassium currents that are strongly inhibited by gq/ <dig> activation  <cit> . in scg neurons, kv <dig>  and kv <dig>   subunits underlie the m-current  <cit> , and their inhibition is due to depletion of pip <dig> levels by phospholipase c  <cit> . thus, m-current inhibition by mglur <dig> and  <dig> functions as a pure assay for gq/ <dig> activation, as there is no pertussis toxin sensitive  component to this modulation  <cit> . as expected, scg neurons expressing mglur5b were strongly inhibited by both 1 mm chpg and 100 μm glu . in these cells, the m-current was inhibited by 78 ± 13%, and  <dig> ±10% by chpg and glu, respectively . in  <dig> mglur1a-expressing cells examined, modulation of the m-current by glu was strong, as expected, with an average inhibition of 67 ± 8%. however, the inhibition produced by chpg in the same cells was quite variable and on average, much smaller than that produced by glu. chpg inhibition via mglur1a averaged only 37 ± 15% . indeed, every cell examined showed substantial glu-mediated m-current inhibition, but only half of these cells exhibited detectable inhibition by chpg. this is evident when chpg inhibition was plotted vs. glu inhibition for each cell in figure 6c. indeed, the ratio of chpg-mediated inhibition to glu mediated inhibition of the m-current was significantly smaller in mglur1a expressing scg neurons than in mglur5b expressing cells , suggesting that chpg does show some degree of partial agonism in this system. these data may help to explain the discrepancy between the data presented here, suggesting that chpg functions as an agonist with similar efficacy and potency on mglur1a as on mglur <dig>  and that in the literature, which reports highly selective effects of chpg  <cit> . it should be emphasized however, that chpg was not a poor activator of this pathway in every mglur1a expressing cell, suggesting that the apparent biased agonism is complex and may be influenced by other, as yet undetermined factors.

to further explore the potential biased agonist properties of chpg on mglur <dig>  the calcium current inhibition via chpg was examined in more detail. modulation of scg calcium currents by group i mglurs is complex. activation of both gi/o and gq/ <dig> by mglur <dig> and  <dig> leads to calcium current inhibition, and the two pathways are distinguishable by their voltage dependence. the pathway initiated by gi/o activation is mediated by gβγ  <cit> , and is therefore at least partially reversible following a strong depolarizing step  <cit> . by contrast, the gq/ <dig> mediated inhibition is voltage independent  <cit> . to evaluate the relative contributions of these modulatory pathways, a triple pulse voltage protocol can be used to monitor current amplitude as the receptors are activated  <cit>  . this protocol consists of two test pulses to +10 mv separated by a 50 msec depolarizing step to +80 mv. because the depolarizing step will selectively reverse much of the gi/o-mediated inhibition due to its voltage dependence, the relative contribution of each g protein pathway to calcium current inhibition can be gauged by simply dividing the percent inhibition in the second test pulse  by that in the first . the higher this inhibition ratio, the stronger the relative contribution of the gq/ <dig> pathway. however, because the voltage dependent pathway is not completely reversed by the depolarizing step and because the relationship between the two pathways is not strictly additive  <cit> , this method cannot be used to determine the absolute contribution of each pathway. nevertheless, to determine whether chpg was a weaker activator of gq/ <dig> then glu when acting through mglur1a, the post/pre inhibition ratio was examined during calcium current inhibition experiments in scg neurons expressing either mglur5b or mglur1a .

as noted previously  <cit> , the contribution of the voltage dependent and voltage independent calcium current inhibitory pathways via group i mglurs in scg neurons is quite variable. further, based on the m-current data , it was expected that any differences in gq/ <dig> activation by chpg and glu would be inconsistent. therefore, to insure that any changes would be detectable, analysis was restricted to cells in which the post/pre inhibition ratio by 100 μm glu was  <dig>  or higher, because these cells had a clearly detectable gq/ <dig> component. figure 7a shows sample current traces illustrating the voltage dependence of inhibition by 100 μm glu  and 1 mm chpg  in scg neurons expressing either mglur5b  or mglur1a . figure 7b shows a plot of the post/pre inhibition ratio for glu and chpg in each group for every cell in which the ratio was >  <dig> . while there was substantial variability in the ratios from cell to cell, and in the differences in ratios between glu and chpg, the post/pre inhibition ratios for glu and chpg in mglur5-expressing cells was statistically indistinguishable. a small but statistically significant difference was observed however, in mglur1a expressing cells  when comparing the inhibition by chpg to that by glu by providing more evidence that chpg is a poorer activator than glu of the gq/ <dig> pathway in some cells. these data lend some support for the ability of chpg to act as a biased agonist on mglur <dig>  but both the calcium current and m-current inhibition data demonstrate that chpg is capable of activating gq/ <dig>  even fairly strongly, in some cells.

discussion
the data presented here indicate that contrary to previous reports  <cit> , the nominally selective agonist chpg can activate mglur <dig> with similar efficacy and potency as mglur <dig>  consistent with the literature however, chpg did not produce any detectable activation of mglur <dig> or mglur <dig>  the effects of chpg were examined using heterologous expression of each receptor in rat sympathetic neurons, an adult neuronal cell type with null-mglur expression, and assayed using g protein mediated modulation of native ion channel currents as an assay for receptor signaling. further, using m-current inhibition as an assay for receptor function, a pathway that depends only on gq signaling, revealed that in some cells, chpg agonism of mglur <dig> appeared to show some biased agonism. specifically, while some mglur1-expressing cells showed similar m-current inhibition using chpg or glu as an agonist, others were strongly inhibited by glu, but only very weakly by chpg. these data provide some contrast to those obtained using calcium current inhibition as an assay, which proceeds through a combination of gq/ <dig> and pertussis toxin sensitive gβγ activation  <cit> . examination of calcium current inhibition by chpg in mglur <dig> expressing cells revealed that the gq/11-mediated, voltage independent inhibitory pathway was not as strongly activated by chpg as glu, supporting the hypothesis that chpg is a poorer gq/ <dig> activator than glu. however, the difference was not robust. thus, while these data indicate that chpg can effectively act as an agonist at mglur1a and its splice variant mglur1b, the overall balance of gi/o/gq/ <dig> protein activation may be altered when chpg rather than glu is used as the agonist.

the apparent biased agonism of chpg when applied to mglur1-expressing cells was interesting, but the variability of the effect is difficult to explain. it is possible that the variability was related to mglur <dig> expression level, but this conclusion is difficult to reconcile with the data. due to the nature of these studies, receptor expression cannot be directly measured, but an estimate of expression can be made by assuming that expression level correlates with the magnitude of inhibition by glu in each cell. for example, the m-current inhibition data in figure  <dig> shows that in the  <dig> mglur1a expressing cells examined, m-current inhibition ranged from about 35% to about 90%. while there may be some relationship between chpg responses and glu responses in these cells, the relationship is weak. for example, in the  <dig> cells that showed virtually no response to chpg, the range of glu responses was quite broad, including two cells with substantial inhibition by glu . further, examination of the voltage dependence of calcium current inhibition  yields similar, ambiguous results . if the post/pre calcium current inhibition ratio, a measure of the strength of gq activation by chpg, is plotted against the amplitude of total inhibition by glu, an estimate of expression level, the effects are widely scattered and poorly correlated . thus, the data do not provide strong evidence that the degree of g protein activation bias by chpg via mglur <dig> is related to receptor expression levels. it should also be noted that while chpg was less efficient than glu at producing gq-mediated current inhibition in most of the mglur <dig> expressing cells examined in the calcium current studies, chpg still activated this pathway to a relatively strong degree . therefore, while some bias in g protein activation of chpg via mglur <dig> is detectable, it is unlikely that this effect will be meaningful in a physiological or in vivo context. however, the existence of a group i mglur agonist with g protein bias is novel, and suggests that development of compounds with more significant biased properties is possible.

given the effect of chpg on mglur1a, it was not surprising that the drug had similar effects on mglur1b since both splice variants are identical in the n-terminal, ligand binding region. in fact, these proteins differ only in their extreme cytoplasmic c-termini, which is not expected to alter receptor pharmacology. furthermore, there is no evidence that g protein activation differs in these splice variants, as both mglur1a and 1b can produce qualitatively similar calcium current and m-current inhibition in scg neurons  <cit> . effects of chpg on both variants was tested primarily to confirm the rather surprising result of chpg agonism on mglur <dig>  a result which has not been previously reported despite fairly widespread use of this drug for over a decade  <cit> . indeed, the mglur1a data shown in figure 3b is combined data from scg neurons expressing mglur1a from two separate, but similar, plasmids. one is an untagged rat mglur1a, and the other is an n-terminally myc-tagged mglur1a, both in pcdna <dig> . the data were combined because chpg acted identically on cells expressing both constructs . both constructs  were tested for responses to chpg, and sequence-verified. finally, it should be noted that the results with the mglur <dig> constructs were generated using chpg from two separate sources  with indistinguishable results .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here indicate that contrary to current dogma, the nominally selective mglur <dig> agonist chpg can act as an agonist for mglur <dig> and  <dig> with similar efficacy and potency, although under some circumstances chpg may be a poorer activator than glu of gq/ <dig> via mglur <dig> compared to mglur <dig>
