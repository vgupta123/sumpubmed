BACKGROUND
orofacial clefts are some of the most common birth disorders today. typically, they are disfiguring, can affect respiration, speech, and eating, and require many surgeries to repair. the two main types of orofacial clefts are cleft lip with or without cleft palate  and cleft palate  alone. cl/p occurs in approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  births per  <dig> and cp in  <dig>  to  <dig>  per  <dig> births  <cit> . cl/p can affect the primary palate , in which the four maxillary incisors are set at the front of the mouth, or both the pp and secondary palate . the sp is posterior to the pp and forms the main barrier between the oral and nasal cavities. similarly, cp can affect the sp or both the pp and sp.

development of the sp begins around embryonic day   <dig>  in mice and in week six during human gestation. due to developmental similarities between mice and humans, the mouse is an ideal model animal in which to study sp development. initially, the sp exists as two shelves that arise from maxillary prominences on either side of the tongue. these shelves will grow downward alongside the tongue then quickly elevate when the tongue depresses, ultimately growing together around e <dig> . with their medial edges in contact, the two shelves fuse together and the epithelial cells at the center form the midline epithelial seam . by e <dig> -e <dig> , this mes has degraded and a solid, confluent sp remains . development of the sp is a carefully coordinated event and requires the actions of many proteins, including transcription factors  <cit> , growth factors and their receptors, and tissue re-modeling enzymes . any problem with shelf growth, elevation, tongue depression, shelf fusion, or mes degradation can result in a cp.

among the proteins required for sp development are the matrix metalloproteinases . these are a group of proteases with extra-cellular matrix substrates that require coordination of a zinc ion at the centre of the catalytic domain to be active. the mmps are broadly classed into two categories: the secreted and the membrane-associated. they are synthesized intra-cellularly as pro-enzymes and activated via cleavage of their pro-domain in the golgi network or extra-cellularly . treatment of in vitro sp cultures with a general chemical inhibitor of the mmps results in impaired palate shelf fusion and persistence of the medial edge epithelium  where the shelves make contact  <cit> . however, the mmp family contains  <dig> members and which one of the mmps is playing a functional role in sp development is not clear. one candidate is mmp- <dig>  6-mmp; leukolysin), as a genetic analysis of human cp patients reveals a potential association between mmp- <dig> and cl/p  <cit> .

mmp- <dig> is a membrane-associated mmp first cloned from leukocytes but later found in most tissues examined  <cit> . this protein appears to have roles in both healthy and diseased systems. in healthy systems, mmp- <dig> can act as both an extra-cellular protease and an activator of some secreted pro-mmps ; however, mmp- <dig> is also over-expressed in certain cancers and appears to play a role in their progression  <cit> .

despite evidence to support a functional role for mmps in sp development, no further investigations of individual mmps and their role in sp formation have been conducted and thus the role of mmp- <dig> in sp development is currently unknown. to our knowledge, this study represents the first work done on mmp- <dig> in the mouse sp.

using quantitative real-time pcr, in situ hybridization , western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry , we show mmp- <dig> mrna and protein are expressed at all stages of the developing mouse sp with a significant down-regulation at approximately e <dig>  as the mes degrades and sp development comes to an end. using an in vitro culture method and mmp-25-specific small, interfering rna , we show in vitro sp cultures treated with mmp- <dig> sirna exhibit significantly decreased fusion success and increased persistence of the mee. lastly, addition of a tgf-β3-neutralizing antibody to in vitro sp cultures results in significantly decreased mmp- <dig> mrna and protein expression, providing evidence that mmp- <dig> is a downstream target of tgf-β <dig> signaling.

RESULTS
mmp- <dig> is expressed in the developing sp at all stages
quantitative real-time pcr and ish confirm mmp- <dig> mrna expression in the embryonic mouse sp at all developmental stages . expression of mmp- <dig> mrna increases from e <dig>  to e <dig> , where its expression is strongest, before decreasing at e <dig>  and even further by e <dig> . mmp- <dig> mrna levels are significantly decreased at e <dig>  relative to e <dig>  and e <dig>  . the increased expression of mmp- <dig> at e <dig>  and e <dig>  suggests a role for mmp- <dig> in promoting palate shelf growth. at this stage in development, the palate shelves are budding from the maxilla and growing downward alongside the tongue. a decline in mmp- <dig> expression occurs as the shelves are fusing  and the mes is degrading . western blot analysis indicates mmp- <dig> protein expression levels parallel mrna levels in the embryonic mouse sp . mmp- <dig> appears as a band of approximately  <dig> kilodaltons , which corresponds to previously published reports of a  <dig> kda molecular weight for mmp- <dig>  <cit> .

mmp- <dig> protein and mrna levels are highest in the epithelium of the palate shelves
ihc and ish indicate mmp- <dig> protein and mrna localize more strongly to the epithelium of the palate shelves than the underlying mesenchyme . at e <dig>  and e <dig> , the strongest immunofluorescence is detected in the epithelium of the palate shelves although staining is also visible in the apical mesenchyme  with expression also visible in the underlying mesenchyme. at e <dig> , the mes is degrading and little epithelium is left between the two palate shelves . mmp- <dig> immunofluorescence at this stage is noticeably weaker than from e <dig>  to e <dig> , but remains prominently in the epithelium as indicated by the oral epithelium and a degrading remnant of the mes . this decline in mmp- <dig> expression at e <dig>  coincides with a confirmed decline in mmp- <dig> mrna and protein levels . mmp- <dig> immunofluorescence in the sp localizes to the plasma membranes of the epithelial and mesenchymal cells, which is expected as mmp- <dig> is a membrane-associated mmp  <cit> . the data indicating stronger mmp- <dig> expression in apical areas of palate shelf growth from e <dig>  and e <dig>  suggest mmp- <dig> may play a role in facilitating this growth, possibly by removing extra-cellular matrix barriers to increased cell proliferation and movement and/or by activating pro-mmps that could do the same  <cit> .

mmp- <dig> has a functional role during mouse sp formation
to determine if mmp- <dig> is playing a functional role during mouse sp formation, mmp- <dig> expression was knocked down in vitro using mmp- <dig> sirna and whole sp cultures as previously described  <cit> . addition of stealth™ rnai mmp- <dig> sirna  to a final concentration of  <dig> nm resulted in decreased palate shelf fusion and persistence of the mee in vitro as evidenced by representative hematoxlyin and eosin-stained palatal sections . while the wild-type and negative control sirna palatal cultures fused normally, the palatal cultures treated with mmp- <dig> sirna seemed largely unable to progress to the fusion stage despite making contact. interestingly, the phenotype of our mmp- <dig> sirna-treated palatal cultures  after  <dig> h incubation is very similar to the phenotype of other in vitro palatal cultures treated with a general chemical inhibitor of the mmps  <cit> . to obtain a more objective measure of the mmp- <dig> sirna effects, serial sections of preserved and frozen palatal cultures were generated. sections examined by light microscopy were assigned a score between  <dig> and  <dig> based upon fusion success  <cit>  . for each palatal culture examined, the scores were combined and averaged to obtain a mean fusion score  and these mfss themselves averaged for an entire group . the wild-type control palatal cultures  had a cumulative mfs of  <dig>  while the scrambled duplex sirna negative control group  had a mfs of  <dig> . these scores put both groups solidly in the fusion category and indicate minimal non-specific sirna or transfection reagent effects. the mfs of the palatal culture group treated with  <dig> nm mmp- <dig> sirna  was significantly lower at  <dig>  . to ensure the drop in mfs could be attributed to mmp- <dig> mrna and subsequent protein knockdown, quantitative real-time pcr and western blot analyses were carried out on rna and protein isolated from the remaining palatal cultures from each group. the mmp- <dig> sirna knocked down both mmp- <dig> mrna and protein levels efficiently . quantitative real-time pcr shows a significant decrease in mmp- <dig> mrna levels in the mmp- <dig> sirna-treated group relative to the control groups , and western blot analysis displays a sharp reduction in mmp- <dig> protein levels in the treated group when compared to the control groups . taken together, these data suggest a functional role for mmp- <dig> in mouse sp development.

apalate shelves were removed at e <dig>  and cultured for  <dig> h prior to sectioning and assessment of shelf fusion.

mmp- <dig> is a downstream transcriptional target of tgf-β3
the secreted growth factor tgf-β <dig> is vital to the successful formation of the mouse sp  <cit> . tgf-β <dig> exerts biological activity through its receptors, which are tyrosine kinases, and its intra-cellular mediators, the smad proteins, which translocate to the nucleus affecting gene transcription following phosphorylation . an examination of the proximal promoter sequence of mmp- <dig> obtained from the eukaryotic promoter database http://www.epd.isb-sib.ch/ displayed repeating sequences of 5'-gtct-3' and 5'-caga-3' , which are sites of preferential binding by the smad proteins  <cit> . due to the existence of smad binding sites just upstream of the mmp- <dig> transcription start site and given the important role of tgf-β <dig> in palate development  <cit> , we hypothesized mmp- <dig> could be a target of tgf-β <dig>  mmp- <dig> mrna and protein levels significantly decreased  following  <dig> h incubation with  <dig> μg/ml of a tgf-β3-neutralizing antibody . this decreased expression of mmp- <dig> is not due to apoptotic cell death as activated caspase <dig> was not detected in palatal cultures treated with tgf-β3-neutralizing antibody . mmp- <dig> mrna and protein levels between the groups treated with different concentrations of the tgf-β3-neutralizing antibody were not significantly different. to confirm the decrease in mmp- <dig> mrna and protein could be attributed to a loss of tgf-β <dig> activity in the cultures, western blot analysis was carried out on protein isolated from the four groups with a phospho-smad <dig> antibody. levels of phospho-smad <dig> were inversely correlated with the concentration of the tgf-β3-neutralizing antibody; as the bio-neutralizing antibody concentration went up, phospho-smad <dig> levels went down .

the strength of the mmp- <dig> gene expression knockdown by the tgf-β3-neutralizing antibody is supported by several lines of evidence. first, expression of mmp- <dig> is found in the palate shelf in a manner very similar to the expression pattern of tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . second, tgf-β <dig> is only detectable after the horizontal palatal shelf stage  <cit> , and expression of tgf-β <dig> from the tgf-β <dig> locus cannot completely rescue tgf-β3-induced cleft palate  <cit> . spatially, tgf-β <dig> expression is restricted to the palate mesenchyme and is not apparent until the palate shelves are fusing  <cit> . thus, tgf-β <dig> expression is temporally and spatially distinct from and unlikely to contribute to mmp- <dig> expression. this evidence also suggests tgf-β3-specific activity in the developing sp that cannot be compensated for by other tgf-β isoforms  <cit> . a link between the mmps and tgf-β <dig> is not without precedent; mmp- <dig> expression has been demonstrated to be downstream of tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . these data suggest mmp- <dig> is a direct transcriptional target for tgf-β <dig> in mouse sp development and could be a target for tgf-β <dig> elsewhere as well.

CONCLUSIONS
mmp- <dig> mrna and protein are expressed in the developing mouse sp from stages e <dig>  to e <dig> , and protein expression largely localizes to the epithelium of the palate shelves. expression of mmp- <dig> mrna and protein is highest at e <dig>  and mrna levels significantly decrease by e <dig> . ihc and ish analysis of mmp- <dig> protein and mrna expression, respectively, show mmp- <dig> is most abundant in the epithelium of the palate shelves although expression is also visible in the underlying mesenchyme. expression in the mesenchyme appears strongest in apical areas immediately adjacent to the overlying epithelium at e <dig>  and e <dig>  where it may play a role in facilitating growth. at e <dig> , mmp- <dig> protein and mrna expression appear highest in medial epithelia  as palatal shelves come together to fuse. at e <dig> , a down-regulation of expression is evident when fusion is nearing completion.

through the use of palatal cultures, we demonstrate treatment with an mmp-25-specific sirna decreases palate shelf fusion and results in significant persistence of mee in vitro. this is the first report supporting a functional role for a single mmp in mouse sp development. our in vitro palatal culture work coupled with the ihc, ish, and real-time pcr data suggest mmp- <dig> plays a key role in palate shelf growth at e <dig>  and e <dig>  by removing extra-cellular matrix barriers that would hinder cell proliferation and movement. the substrates of mmp- <dig> include type iv collagen, fibronectin, and fibrin  <cit> , which are all components of the extra-cellular matrix and barriers to cell proliferation and movement. ihc analysis of mmp- <dig> protein expression in colorectal tissue sections shows mmp- <dig> is strongly expressed on the leading edge of tumours and positively correlates to an invasive cancer  <cit> . our results indicate mmp- <dig> protein expression in the developing mouse sp is also higher on the apical, or leading, edge. most compellingly, double knock-out of mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig>  results in a cleft palate in mice due to impaired growth of the palate shelves  <cit> , which implies a role for proteolytic enzymes in mouse sp development even though no palate defects were reported for the single gene knock-out of either mmp- <dig>  <cit>  or mmp- <dig>  <cit> . the protease activity of both mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> when knocked out on their own may have been compensated for by mmp- <dig>  which is also a proteolytic membrane-associated mmp, just as the collagenolytic activity of mmp- <dig> was compensated for by mmp- <dig> in previous experiments  <cit> . our results indicate that mmp- <dig> may be the key proteolytic enzyme among the mmps during mouse sp formation.

our treatment of whole palatal cultures with a tgf-β3-neutralizing antibody in the culture medium resulted in a significant decrease in mmp- <dig> mrna and protein. thus, we have established a link between mmp- <dig> and tgf-β <dig> in the developing mouse sp that warrants further investigation.

overall, what is known about mmp- <dig> in embryonic development remains limited. this is the first report to identify a role for a single mmp in mouse sp development and validates the link between mmp- <dig> and cl/p identified from human genetic analysis scans of cp patients  <cit> .
