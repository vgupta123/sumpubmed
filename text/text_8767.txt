BACKGROUND
the gastrointestinal  microbiota is considered to play an important role in human health and disease via essential metabolic, trophic and protective functions in the host  <cit> . since the majority of the gi bacteria are uncultivable, molecular biology methods are needed to reveal the detailed composition, diversity and specific role of this complex microbial community  <cit> . the bacterial groups most often detected in molecular studies of the healthy human gi tract are phyla firmicutes , bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, actinobacteria, fusobacteria and verrucomicrobia  <cit> . the predominant microbiota in adults is considered rather stable and host-specific  <cit> , but gender, geographic origin, age  <cit> , and host genotype  <cit>  may influence its composition. furthermore, alterations within an individual's environmental factors, such as diet  <cit>  and dietary supplements  <cit> , intestinal health status  <cit>  and antibiotics  <cit> , may also have a substantial effect on the intestinal microbiota. therefore, as a reference to altered conditions, knowledge of the characteristics of a healthy intestinal microbiota is essential.

the proportional amounts of bacterial phyla detected in studies on the gi tract microbiota depend on both the sample handling and dna extraction methods applied  <cit>  and the analysis  <cit> . recent metagenomic and pyrosequencing studies on the human intestinal microbiota highlight the potential amount of the yet undiscovered diversity of phylotypes and reshape the porportional abundances of the detected phyla, revealing e.g. a higher abundance of actinobacteria than previously estimated  <cit> . however, the conventional 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing is still a valuable method, since it gives a relatively high taxonomic resolution due to longer read length  <cit>  and can be targeted to a phylogenetically relevant gene  in comparison with the metagenomic approach. furthermore, the clone library obtained serves as a valuable reference for possible future use. to enhance the recovery of phylotypes in bacterial community samples, the genomic %g+c content -based profiling and fractioning of dna can be used  <cit> .

in a previous study comparing patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome  with healthy volunteers, the faecal dna of  <dig> healthy donors was pooled and %g+c profiled and three selected fractions, covering 34% of the fractioned dna, were cloned and sequenced  <cit> . with the aim to comprehensively elucidate the bacterial phylotype diversity of the gi microbiota of healthy subjects, the remaining seven %g+c fractions were cloned and sequenced in this study, to represent the scale of bacterial genomic %g+c content ranging from 25% to 75%  <cit> . for methodological comparison, a clone library from unfractioned pooled faecal dna samples of the same study subjects was constructed. the results provide more detailed insight into the human gi microbiota especially in the context of the diversity of high %g+c bacteria, i.e. actinobacteria.

RESULTS
percent guanine plus cytosine -profiling, cloning and sequencing
to analyse the diversity of the healthy human intestinal microbiota, a %g+c profiled and fractionated  pooled faecal bacterial dna sample of  <dig> individuals was cloned, and the partial 16s rrna genes were sequenced. the previously published  <dig> sequences from three %g+c fractions   <cit>  were combined with the  <dig> new sequences cloned in this study  for phylogenetic and statistical analyses of the complete %g+c profile ranging from 25% g+c to 75% g+c . altogether,  <dig> sequences encompassing approximately  <dig> bp from the 5'-end of the 16s rrna gene, covering two variable areas v <dig> and v <dig>  were sequenced from all clones from the fractioned sample. for comparison,  <dig> clones were sequenced from an unfractioned pooled faecal bacterial dna sample originating from the same individuals.

determination of operative taxonomic units and library coverage
the quality-checked  <dig> sequences from the combined fractioned sample libraries represented  <dig> operative taxonomic units , and the  <dig> sequences from the unfractioned sample represented  <dig> otus with a 98% similarity criterion . all novel otus with less than 95% sequence similarity to public sequence database entries were further sequenced to near full-length . the coverages of the individual clone libraries of the fractioned sample ranged from 77% to 93%, while the coverage for the unfractioned sample was 86%  <cit>  . compared with other fractions, the fractions %g+c 50– <dig>  55– <dig> and 60– <dig> had low otu numbers and few singletons, resulting in high good's coverage values. the combined sequences from the fractioned and unfractioned samples clustered into  <dig> otus .

phylogenetic analysis and sequence affiliation
when the sequence data from the fractioned clone libraries were combined, the majority of the sequences were assigned to the phyla firmicutes , actinobacteria , bacteroidetes  and proteobacteria  . clostridium clusters iv and xiv were the most abundant firmicutes represented by  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the sequences, respectively. the  <dig> actinobacterial phylotypes consisted of the orders bifidobacteriales, coriobacteriales and actinomycetales accounting for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the sequences, respectively .

a. affiliation with acidobacteria, cyanobacteria, tm <dig> and verrucomicrobia

the distribution of phyla within the individual clone libraries of the fractioned sample revealed that firmicutes settled mostly in the lower %g+c content portion of the profile, whereas actinobacteria were found in the fractions with a %g+c content ranging from 50% to 70% . prominent phylotypes had a seemingly broader distribution across %g+c fractions. in the fractions having %g+c content above 65%, a bias was observed, i.e. a decrease in high g+c actinobacteria and an increase in low g+c firmicutes. the three otus with the highest number of sequences fell into the clostridium clusters xiva and iv, representing the species eubacterium rectale , faecalibacterium prausnitzii  and ruminococcus bromii  with over  <dig> % sequence similarity.

within the phylum actinobacteria, the most abundant coriobacteriales phylotypes  according to the number of representative clones  affiliated with collinsella sp. . the remainder represented atopobium sp., denitrobacterium sp., eggerthella sp., olsenella sp. and slackia sp. the order bifidobacteriales consisted of  <dig> sequences and  <dig> phylotypes out of which bifidobacterium adolescentis was the most abundant. rest of the bifidobacterial otus affiliated with b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. bifidum, b. dentium and b. longum. the order actinomycetales comprised of  <dig> otus affiliating with actinomyces sp., microbacterium sp., propionibacterium sp., rhodococcus sp. and rothia sp. .

the unfractioned sample essentially resembled the %g+c fractions 40– <dig> and 45– <dig> . in comparison to the combined fractioned clone libraries' the amount of firmicutes , especially the percentage of the clostridium cluster xiv , increased while the number of actinobacteria  decreased. the proportion of bacteroidetes  and proteobacteria  were the least affected phyla when fractioned and unfractioned libraries were compared . all  <dig> actinobacterial sequences of the unfractioned library were included in otus of the fractioned libraries and actinomycetales phylotypes were absent in this library . the phyla actinobacteria differed significantly  between the fractioned and unfractioned libraries in the unifrac lineage-specific analysis, though the libraries overall were similar according to the unifrac significance test . clones from the phylum firmicutes present in the fractioned library but absent in the unfractioned library affiliated with enterococcaceae, lactobacillaceae and staphylococcacceae. furthermore, only one gammaproteobacteria was found in the unfractioned library whereas the fractioned samples contained also the members of alphaproteobacteria, betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria .

comparison of individual libraries
the shared otus and similarity  program  <cit>  was used to compare the unfractioned sample with each of the %g+c fractions and with the combined sequence data from the fractions . using a 98% similarity criterion for the phylotypes, at least 80% of sequences from %g+c fractions 30– <dig> and 35– <dig> were shared with the unfractioned sample . however, for two of the high %g+c content fractions with %g+c content from  <dig> to  <dig>  the vobs values were considerably lower . when comparing the combined sequence data from the fractioned sample with the unfractioned sample, a higher percentage of sequences and otus in the unfractioned were shared.

shannon entropies of clone libraries of the %g+c profiled sample
the %g+c fractions 50– <dig> and 55– <dig> had comparatively low shannon entropies , indicating lower diversity, and were abundant with bifidobacteria . the peripheral %g+c fractions and the %g+c fraction 45– <dig> with sequences affiliating mainly with clostridium clusters iv and xiv had comparatively higher diversity according to shannon entropies. the peripheral fraction from the low %g+c end  contained a substantial proportion of firmicutes that do not belong to the clostridum clusters iv and xiv. it had the highest shannon entropy , indicating rich diversity, and did not reach a plateau in the rarefaction curves , which means that more otus would have been likely to appear after further sequencing.

discussion
for a comprehensive evaluation of the human intestinal microbiota, 16s rrna gene clone libraries were constructed from a %g+c fractioned pooled faecal dna sample of  <dig> healthy subjects followed by a sequence analysis of  <dig> clones. previously, only selected fractions of such profiles have been sequenced and analysed. for methodological comparison, a 16s rrna gene library of unfractioned dna from  <dig> individuals representing the same subject group was also constructed. the %g+c fractioning prior to cloning and sequencing enhanced the recovery of sequences affiliating with high g+c gram-positive bacteria, namely the phylum actinobacteria, proportionally over sevenfold compared with cloning and sequencing of an unfractioned sample.

a high amount of actinobacterial sequences recovered
if the proportional amount of dna in each fraction is taken into account in estimating the abundance of phyla,  <dig> % of the sequences would affiliate with actinobacteria. since the %g+c profile fractions represent individual cloning and sequencing experiments, in which an equal amount of clones were sequenced despite the different proportional amounts of dna within the fractions, quantitative conclusions should be drawn carefully. however, %g+c fractions 50– <dig> were dominated by actinobacteria, comprising 41% of the total dna in the original sample fractioned . the %g+c fractions 30– <dig> yield a similar phylotype distribution as the unfractioned library . these fractions, accounting for 54% of the profiled dna, are dominated by the firmicutes  .

the relatively high proportion of actinobacterial sequences  and phylotypes  identified in the combined sequence data of the %g+c fractioned sample exceed all previous estimations. in a metagenomic study by gill and colleagues  <cit> ,  <dig> % of  <dig> 16s rrna sequences from random shotgun assemblies affiliated with  <dig> phylotypes of actinobacteria whereas no bacteroidetes was detected. in accordance with our results, also a pyrosequencing study by andersson and colleagues  <cit> , the actinobacteria , dominated by a few phylotypes, outnumbered bacteroidetes . by contrast, in most of the earlier published studies on human faecal samples applying 16s rrna gene amplification, cloning and sequencing, the relative amount of actinobacteria has been 0–6% of the detected intestinal microbiota  <cit> . thus, the proportion of sequences affiliating with actinobacteria  in the unfractioned sample analysed in this study is comparable with previous estimations applying conventional 16s rrna cloning and sequencing without %g+c fractioning.

order coriobacteriales abundant within actinobacteria
we observed that several clones in the high %g+c fractions  were tricky to sequence due to extremely g+c rich regions. these clones turned out to be members of order coriobacteriales, which have been rare or absent in earlier 16s rrna gene -based clone libraries of the intestinal microbiota. over half of the actinobacterial otus in our study belonged to the order coriobacteriales. harmsen et al.  <cit>  earlier suggested that applications based on 16s rrna gene cloning as well as other methods of molecular biology may overlook the presence of the family coriobacteriaceae in the human gi tract and they designed a group-specific probe for atopobium , covering most of the coriobacteriaceae, the coriobacterium group. using ato <dig>  the abundance of detected intestinal cells in fluorescence in situ hybridization  is up to  <dig> %.  <cit> . recently, khachatryan and colleagues  <cit>  did not detect any actinobacteria from the 16s rrna gene clone libraries of healthy subjects but the abundance with fish using ato <dig> was 7%. the authors suggested that constant underestimation of the high g+c gram-positive bacteria might lead to misunderstanding their role in the healthy and diseased gut.

there are some data suggesting that the members of coriobacteriaceae may be indicators of a healthy gi microbiota. subjects with a low risk of colon cancer have been observed to have a higher incidence of collinsella aerofaciens than subjects with a high risk of colon cancer  <cit> . furthermore, when faecal 16s rrna gene sequences from metagenomic libraries of crohn's diseased and healthy subjects were compared, the atopobium group was more prevalent and the groups designated "other actinobacteria" were exclusively detected in healthy subjects' samples  <cit> . a lower abundance of a c. aerofaciens-like phylotype within the atopobium group has been associated with ibs subjects' samples  <cit> . diminished amount of atopobium group bacteria is also associated with patients with mediterranean fever  <cit> . on the other hand, increased amount of actinobacteria have recently been associated with the faecal microbiota of obese subjects  <cit> . this indicates that more detailed data are required to judge the role of actinobacteria in health and disease.

methodological observations
when the %g+c gradient is disassembled, the fractions with the highest g+c content are collected last, making them most susceptible to turbulence. this phenomenon together with possible remnants of dna from previously collected fractions could have caused the bias of a decrease in high g+c actinobacteria and an increase in low g+c firmicutes observed in fractions %g+c 65– <dig>  these fractions, however, comprise only  <dig> % of the total dna, making the observed bias less important. regarding faecal dna extraction, the method used here was rather rigorous, allowing efficient dna isolation also from more enduring gram-positive bacteria. this might lower the relative amount of dna from more easily lysed gram-negative bacteria and thus explain the comparatively low amount of bacteroides in both of the samples. moreover, the relative share of bacteroidetes phyla may be affected by the delay and temperature of freezing. in a real-time pcr study, a decrease of 50% in the bacteroides group was observed in faecal sample aliquots frozen in -70°c within  <dig> h compared to samples that were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen . in our study, the samples were transported within  <dig> h of the defecation and stored at -70°c.

abundance of actinobacteria in the faeces of scandinavian  subjects has been discovered independent of the methodology; the techniques used include %g+c profiling and 16s rdna gene cloning , fish coupled with flow cytometry  <cit>  and pyrosequencing  <cit> . these findings may suggest existence of demographic similarities among scandinavians, which could be caused by environmental or genetic factors and that are not obscured by methodological bias of dna extraction, primers and pcr conditions used.

CONCLUSIONS
the results further confirm that %g+c fractioning is an efficient method prior to pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing to obtain a more detailed understanding of the diversity of complex microbial communities, especially within the high genomic %g+c content region. this is proven by the proportionally greater amount of otus and sequences affiliating with the high g+c gram-positive phylum actinobacteria in the 16s rrna gene clone libraries originating from a %g+c-profiled and -fractioned faecal microbial genomic dna sample compared with a sample cloned and sequenced without prior %g+c profiling. the clone content obtained from the unfractioned library is in accordance with many previous clone library analyses and thus suggests that the potential underestimation of high g+c gram positive bacteria, have hidden the importance of these bacteria in a healthy gut. the phyla actinobacteria were the second most abundant phyla detected in the %g+c fractioned sample consisting mainly of sequences affiliating with mainly coriobacteriaceae.
