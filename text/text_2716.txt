BACKGROUND
hs-1-associated protein x- <dig>  hax- <dig>  is a 35 kda protein with two bcl- <dig> homology  domains that was identified in a yeast two hybrid screen where it was found to interact with hs- <dig>  a src kinase substrate  <cit> . hax- <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues and is reported to be localized in mitochondria as well as the endoplasmic reticulum  and nuclear membrane  <cit> . mutations identified in the human hax- <dig> gene have been shown to cause neutropenia and neurodevelopmental abnormalities  <cit> . knockout hax- <dig> mice show increased apoptosis of neurons and postnatal lethality.  <cit> . hax- <dig> is a multifunctional protein that plays roles in calcium homeostasis  <cit> , cell migration  <cit>  and apoptotic regulation  <cit> . it was reported that hax- <dig> protects cells against various stimuli and has been shown to interact with a number of cellular and viral proteins to suppress their pro-death properties  <cit> . in addition, hax- <dig> has been found to be up-regulated in breast cancer, lung cancer and melanoma  <cit> , suggesting that it also has a role in oncogenesis.

a pest sequence is a peptide sequence which is rich in proline , glutamic acid , serine , and threonine . it is known that the pest sequence functions as a proteolytic signal to target proteins for degradation resulting in short intracellular half lives  <cit> . for example, the pest sequence of nf-kappa b is responsible for its cleavage by calpain  <cit> . it was reported that c-myc, a protein with a pest sequence, has a half-life shorter than one hour  <cit> . notch  <dig>  another short-lived protein, is ubiquitinated by an e <dig> ligase sel- <dig> and degraded by the proteasome dependent on its pest sequence  <cit> .

hax- <dig> was predicted to contain a pest sequence   <cit> , however, it is still unknown whether this pest sequence effects its turnover rate. in this study, we investigated the stability of hax- <dig> in different cells and explored the role of the pest sequence in its degradation and biological function.

RESULTS
rapid degradation of hax-1
in addition to its bh domains and a trans-membrane domain, hax- <dig> has a pest sequence  <cit> . the pest region in hax- <dig> is highly conserved in mammalian animals . we tested the degradation profile of hax- <dig> using a cycloheximide  chase experiment in both human lung cancer cell line h <dig> and mouse neuroblastoma cell line n2a. hax- <dig> was found to have a much shorter half-life than other two pro-survival bcl- <dig> family proteins, bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl , suggesting that the hax- <dig> protein is unstable and is rapidly degraded.

pest sequence-dependent degradation of hax-1
we next tested whether the pest sequence in hax- <dig> is responsible for its rapid degradation. a deletion mutant of hax- <dig> was constructed in which the pest sequence  was deleted. the chx chase experiments showed that the Δpest hax- <dig> level remained largely unchanged up to  <dig> hours, whereas wt hax- <dig> level rapidly decreased to < 50 % within  <dig> hours , suggesting that the pest sequence in hax- <dig> is necessary for its rapid degradation.

degradation of hax- <dig> by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
proteasome and autophagy systems are two main pathways for protein degradation. here we tested which pathway is involved in the fast-turnover of hax- <dig>  cells were treated with mg <dig>  a proteasome inhibitor, or bafilomycin a <dig>  an autophagy inhibitor. the level of egfp-hax- <dig> increased in cells treated with mg <dig> for  <dig> hours , whereas in cells treated with bafilomycin a <dig> the protein level remained unchanged up to  <dig> hours . these data suggest that hax- <dig> is mainly degraded by the proteasome, but not by autophagy-lysosome pathway. a time-dependent increase in endogenous hax- <dig> level was also observed in cells treated with mg <dig> . we next examined the turnover of endogenous hax- <dig> in the presence of mg <dig> using chx chase experiments. in the presence of mg <dig>  endogenous hax- <dig> was not observed to be degraded within  <dig> hours, however, in the absence of mg <dig>  it was rapidly degraded after two hours .

hax- <dig> conjugation with k48-linked ubiquitin chains is dependent on the pest sequence
we have shown that hax- <dig> is degraded by the proteasome. usually, the proteasomal degradation process requires polyubiquitination of the substrates  <cit> . we therefore tested if hax- <dig> is ubiquitinated and if yes, what kind of ubiquitin conjugation is involved in the degradation of hax- <dig>  enhanced ubiquitination of hax- <dig> was observed in the presence of mg <dig> than that in the absence of mg <dig>  as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. then, we examined the polyubiquitin of hax- <dig> with two specific antibodies which recognize k48- or k63-linked ubiquitin, respectively. increased polyubiquitination of hax- <dig> was detected with an antibody specific to k48-linked polyubiquitin, but not with that to k63-linked polyubiquitin , suggesting that hax- <dig> is mainly conjugated by the k48-linked ubiquitin chains. we next evaluated if the pest sequence affects hax- <dig> polyubiquitination. we found that the deletion of the pest sequence in hax- <dig> greatly decreased its polyubiquitination , suggesting that the pest sequence in hax- <dig> is necessary for its ubiquitination.

increased degradation of hax- <dig> during apoptosis
as hax- <dig> is known to be an anti-apoptotic protein, we hypothesized whether its degradation is regulated under apoptosis. we transfected h <dig> cells with egfp-hax- <dig> and treated them with dmso or staurosporine , an inducer of apoptosis. in the absence of mg <dig>  the amounts of hax- <dig> protein decreased with increasing concentration of sts, however, in the presence of mg <dig>  the trend was largely attenuated , suggesting an accelerated degradation of hax- <dig> by the proteasome under apoptosis.

Δpest hax- <dig> mutant attenuated sts-induced cell death
as overexpression of hax- <dig> has been shown to have an anti-apoptotic effect and also regulates mitochondria membrane potential  <cit> , we examined the effects of knockdown of hax- <dig> on sts-induced apoptosis. the efficacy of the sirna against hax- <dig> was evaluated . sts induced significantly higher level of apoptosis in those cells in which hax- <dig> levels were knocked down as compared to control cells. this increase in apoptosis also elevated with increased sts dosage . using jc- <dig>  staining, we found that mitochondrial potential was also greatly decreased in hax- <dig> knockdown cells than in control cells upon cccp  treatment . these data indicate that hax- <dig> is important for cells against apoptotic stress or mitochondrial damage. we next transfected cells with wt hax- <dig> or Δpest hax- <dig> and then treated cells with sts. fewer condensed nuclei were observed in egfp-Δpest hax- <dig> expressing cells than in egfp-hax- <dig> expressing cells , suggesting that deletion of pest sequence may increase hax- <dig> stability, causing more resistance to sts-induced apoptosis.

discussion
hax- <dig> transcript levels in mouse kidney, testis, and liver have previously been found to not directly correlate with detected protein levels  <cit> . similar phenomenon has also been observed in rat tissues  <cit> . two hypotheses to explain the different levels of mrna compared to protein are that either high amounts of the hax- <dig> transcript do not translate into proteins or that the protein degradation rate of hax- <dig> is considerably high  <cit> . here, we provide clear evidence showing that hax- <dig> protein is indeed turned over at a fast rate in a proteosome dependent manner. it is important to note that, hax- <dig> exists as many as  <dig> alternative splicing forms  <cit> , and these splicing variants may play important roles in development or tumor formation. for example, the internal deletions in variants vii, viv and vvi result in removal of bh domains and changes in pest domain from variants i   <cit> . it is therefore possible that these variant forms of hax- <dig>  because of its impairment in pest degradation signal, is more stable than its dominant form variant i. the population of cells bearing an up-regulation of these variants shows enhanced protective roles in tissues or more oncogenic activity, as evidenced in tumors  <cit> .

polyubiquitination is required for the protein degradation by the proteasome  <cit> . ubiquitin molecules, which form ubiquitin chains to a protein, are covalently linked to each other between a lysine site  of the previous ubiquitin and the carboxy-terminal glycine of a new ubiquitin. k48-linked polyubiquitination of a protein usually mediates its degradation by the proteasome, however, k63-linked polyubiquitination is most likely to play roles in translation, endocytosis and other functions  <cit> . in the present report, we demonstrate that hax- <dig> is ubiquitinated via k48-linked ubiquitin chains. the ubiquitination of hax- <dig> is largely dependent on its pest sequence. in many short-lived proteins, the pest sequence serves as a signal sequence to drive their proteolysis or rapid degradation  <cit> . in some cases, ubiquitination of proteins depends upon their pest sequence  <cit> . here, we found that deletion of the pest sequence results in much less ubiquitination of hax- <dig>  thereby increasing its stability. it is therefore possible that the pest sequence in hax- <dig> is responsible for its proper folding to be conjugated with the ubiquitin chains. the pest sequence is also reported to be a motif that is involved in protein modification. for example, phosphorylation of a pest sequence by casein kinase ii  appears to promote the degradation of iκbα  <cit> . also, a pest-like sequence has been shown to mediate phosphorylation and efficient ubiquitination of yeast uracil permease  <cit> . further studies to identify if the pest sequence in hax- <dig> is phosphorylated and if this modification affects hax- <dig> stability will be of help to explore the exact role of the pest sequence in hax- <dig> 

hax- <dig> is structurally similar to bcl- <dig> for its bh domains and tm domain. however, hax- <dig> is less stable compared to other bcl- <dig> family proteins  <cit> . it was reported that hax- <dig> is rapidly cleaved by caspase  <dig>  <cit> , htra <dig>  <cit>  or granzyme b  <cit>  during cell death. it is therefore possible that these enzymes contribute to hax- <dig> degradation in apoptosis. as hax- <dig> is a short-lived protein and also degraded by the proteasome, it suggests that the proteasomal degradation of hax- <dig> highly regulates hax- <dig> levels in normal conditions. knockdown of pleiotropic human prohibitin  <dig> in hela cells results in caspase-dependent apoptosis through down-regulation of hax- <dig>  <cit> . here, we report that, in addition to protease cleavage, the proteasomal degradation is also an important post-translational regulation for hax- <dig> during apoptosis . when the pest sequence is abolished, hax- <dig> is shown to convey increased resistance to cell death. taken together, these data suggest that hax- <dig> may be rapidly subjected to proteolysis in response to cellular stresses, resulting in a decrease in its protein level and hence loss of its protective activity.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study demonstrates that hax- <dig> is rapidly degraded by the proteasome in a pest sequence dependent manner. during apoptosis, degradation of hax- <dig> is enhanced whereas expression of Δpest mutant of hax- <dig> protects cells against apoptotic stimulation.
