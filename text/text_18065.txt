BACKGROUND
genomic studies  <cit>  of the apicomplexa parasite plasmodium falciparum – the causative agent of life-threatening malaria – have confirmed earlier observations that this parasite lacks metabolic pathways for de novo synthesis of purines, and hence that purine salvage is essential for their survival. inhibitors that block recycling of purines should therefore form a viable basis for novel malarial therapeutics. purine nucleoside phosphorylase  in plasmodium forms a key enzyme in the recycling of predominantly host-derived purines, catalysing the phosphorolysis of inosine to produce the major purine precursor for the salvage pathway, hypoxanthine, and ribose-1-phosphate . pnp also catalyses phosphorolysis of methylthioinosine, and hence is believed to play an important role in the recycling of this purine from the polyamine biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . although unlikely to be of direct biological relevance, arsenate can replace phosphate in this reaction generating ribose-1-arsenate, which is then rapidly and irreversibly hydrolysed to ribose and arsenate . this alternative reaction is of interest to dissect the mechanistic details of pnp and has contributed to inhibitor development. kinetic isotope  studies have been used to study the pnp mechanism in detail  <cit>  and indicate that catalysis proceeds via a classic sn <dig> nucleophilic substitution reaction in which, at the transition state, the ribitol ring forms an oxocarbenium ion . the derived conformation of this ring has been exploited in the design and synthesis of tight-binding and specific pnp inhibitors such as immucillin-h  . immh is believed to mimic the transition-state formed during this reaction, and binds to the human form of the enzyme  with higher affinity  than do either the reaction substrate inosine  or product hypoxanthine . binding of immh to pnp has been studied in much detail and crystal structures of its complexes with a range of pnp enzymes including bovine pnp  and plasmodium falciparum pnp  have been reported to resolutions of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å respectively. in vivo genetic knock-out studies have recently confirmed pfpnp as the molecular target for the anti-parasiticidal activity of this family of compounds  <cit> .

crystal structures and sequence homology studies have distinguished two broad families of pnp enzymes: those that form trimers  and those that are hexameric , type 1). these groupings correlate with functional differences in that the hexameric enzymes have wider substrate specificity, in particular the ability to use 6-aminopurine nucleosides as substrates. using phylogenetic studies  <cit>  showed that the plasmodium pnps are outliers with equal genetic distance between pnps and uridine phosphorylases. crystallographic studies of pfpnp  <cit>  have shown it forms a hexameric assembly suggesting its closer alignment with the type  <dig> pnp group, although functionally it has been noted that, unlike other hexameric pnps, adenosine is not a substrate for pfpnp. these distinguishing features suggest selectivity for pfpnp, in preference to its mammalian homologues, should be achievable in the development of novel anti-malarials. however, the generality of these distinguishing pnp features across plasmodium parasite species remains unclear. a recent crystal structure of pnp from the closely related simian parasite plasmodium knowlesi  has also been determined ) and, although forming a similar hexameric arrangement, the arrangement of the subunits differs from pfpnp. this largely arises as three loop regions at the subunit interface have been traced to different conformations. in addition, the arrangement of residues in the substrate binding pocket – which does not contain substrate and adjoins one of the loops and the subunit interface – differs significantly in the pkpnp structure relative to pfpnp. it is therefore unclear whether pfpnp represents an archetypal or unique member of the plasmodium pnp enzyme family.

in this study we have therefore extended studies of plasmodium pnps, firstly through a structural analysis of pnp from the second most prevalent human-specific malaria parasite, plasmodium vivax . malaria due to plasmodium vivax infection accounts for up to 40% of the annual incidence of the disease  <cit>  and, although generally less severe, causes considerable morbidity. a genomic sequence for plasmodium vivax has recently become available  <cit> . pvpnp and pfpnp share 81% amino acid sequence identity. secondly, although the enzyme mechanism involving generation of a ribitol oxocarbenium ion is believed to be general for all pnps, the identity, contribution and movements of amino acids within the active site during catalysis differs between various forms of pnp. to further mechanistic understanding of the unusual group of plasmodium pnps, we have also determined the crystal structure of the arsenolytic complex of pfpnp with inosine which is found to contain a mixture of product and reactant components from the reaction. parallel kinetic and binding studies are further used to pinpoint plasmodium-specific features of pnp.

RESULTS
crystal structure of pvpnp
overall structure
the pvpnp crystal structure was refined against  <dig>  Å resolution data  and the model contains all of the protein residues with the exception of the disordered active site loop . the r <dig> crystals displayed considerable anisotropy in the distribution of their diffraction intensities leading to the rejection of many higher resolution reflections during processing. nonetheless, about 70% of the processed reflections have intensities with i/ greater than  <dig> in the highest resolution shell, hence the structure has been refined against all available data to  <dig>  Å. the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a monomer of pvpnp which adopts the familiar single-domain fold topology described previously for hexameric pnps from other species . each pvpnp monomer is comprised of a 10-stranded β-sheet core, which forms the base of the catalytic site, and eight α-helices, which are involved in subunit contacts . the total number and position of secondary structure elements in pvpnp are comparable to those in pfpnp, although small variations in the number of β-strands and α-helices are evident due to different assignments when comparing pfpnp structures . an extra α-helix in the ordered active site loop of pfpnp is not observed in the pvpnp structure, but may be formed when the pvpnp active site loop is structured.

table shows processing and refinement statistics for the diffraction data and models from both crystal forms. the numbers in parentheses refer to data from the highest resolution shell.

the nucleoside binding site of the pvpnp enzyme in this structure is observed to be empty although there is electron density consistent with three bound water molecules within the substrate binding site. additionally, an anion – presumably sulphate from the crystallisation buffer which contained  <dig>  m liso <dig> – was identified and this anion occupies the phosphate binding pocket of the enzyme. its position is consistent with sulphate and phosphate groups observed in other pnp structures including pfpnp  <cit> .

when the r <dig> symmetry operators are applied, pvpnp is seen to form a hexameric assembly that matches the arrangements previously reported in crystal structures of pfpnp  <cit>  and ecpnp  <cit> . presumed to be the biologically-relevant structure, this hexamer is a disc-shaped single-layer with an overall diameter of about  <dig> Å and a thickness corresponding to the width of a monomer  with an empty central channel of diameter  <dig> Å. the hexameric pvpnp appears to be assembled from a trimer of dimers, where the dimer pairs are related by a crystallographic three-fold symmetry axis running through the central channel, corresponding to the view in figure  <dig>  the two monomers in each pair of dimers lie anti-parallel and are related by a crystallographic two-fold axis perpendicular to the major three-fold axis, with the two active sites lying  <dig> Å distant from each other.

inter-subunit contacts in pvpnp are comparable to those reported in the previous pfpnp-inosine structure  <cit>  but different from those observed in the pkpnp structure . the loop  that connects β <dig> and α <dig> is particularly evident in its contribution to the subunit interactions. this loop is adjacent to the central channel and forms contacts both with the neighbouring subunit in each dimer pair – such as a and b – and also extends to a monomer of the adjacent dimer – such as a and c. in the former case, a distinctive hydrogen bond is formed between tyr  <dig> of chain a and glu  <dig> of chain b, which has also been described for pfpnp  <cit>  and pnp from thermus thermophilus   <cit> . the length of this loop differs between hexameric pnp enzymes from different species. relative to pkpnp and ttpnp, the pv and pf enzymes have loops extending about  <dig> Å further from the core, whereas in ecpnp the equivalent loop extends about  <dig> Å. in the pfpnp-inosine structure, schnick et al.  <cit>  showed that this loop also contacts the ligand and proposed that this elongated loop plays an important role for not only quaternary structure formation but also in determining accessibility to and the conformation of the active site cavity. with no substrate bound in the current structure it is not possible to confirm this is also the case for the pvpnp enzyme.

the active site of pvpnp
in common with pfpnp, the phosphate/sulphate binding site of pvpnp  is formed mainly by two arginine residues , a backbone interaction with gly  <dig>  and both backbone and side chain interactions with ser  <dig>  another arginine, residue  <dig>  also lies in this region, but points away from the bound sulphate in the pvpnp structure. this is similar to the arrangement in pfpnp with sulphate bound  <cit>  but differs from pfpnp with arsenate bound . overall, the po4/so <dig> binding pocket in pvpnp is essentially identical to that previously described for pfpnp.

although neither base nor sugar are bound in the nucleoside binding site of the pvpnp-so <dig> structure, these sites can be readily identified by overlaying the hypoxanthine and ribose sugar molecules from the pfpnp-hypoxanthine-ribose-aso <dig> structure . this shows that the base would be primarily accommodated via π-stacking of tyr  <dig> and pro  <dig>  and also trp  <dig> when the active site loop  is ordered. other significant contributors include ser  <dig>  val  <dig>  cys  <dig> and gly  <dig>  asp  <dig>  which has been proposed to play an important role in stabilisation of the transition state complex  <cit>  is also present in the pvpnp purine-binding site, although in a conformation typical of an empty binding site  <cit> . the composition and structure of the base binding pocket in pvpnp is essentially identical to that described for pfpnp, whereas there are substantial differences when compared to this region in the pkpnp structure. although the identity of the key residues is unaltered in pkpnp, the altered conformation of the 159– <dig> loop results in a substantial  displacement of tyr  <dig> which, along with tyr <dig> , now occupies the space in which the base normally binds. this leads to considerable distortion of the base binding pocket.

similarly, the sugar binding site of pvpnp is virtually identical to that of pfpnp. by analogy with the pfpnp complex, the sugar o2' and o3' hydroxyl groups are expected to interact with the side chains of arg  <dig> and glu  <dig>  his 8' from the neighbouring monomer is in a position to bind the ribose o5' hydroxyl group and ser  <dig> is positioned to hydrogen bond to the ribosyl ring o4'. other residues such as tyr  <dig>  met  <dig> and val  <dig> also line the cavity in both structures. by contrast, although many of the above interactions are also possible in the pkpnp structure, the altered conformation reported for the 159– <dig> region once again leads to changes in the sugar binding pocket, with his 8' considerably displaced and its equivalent position now occupied by lys  <dig>  tyr  <dig>  as discussed above, is present but displaced by about  <dig> Å and there is no direct equivalent to val  <dig>  although its role may be partially replicated by ala  <dig> 

crystal structure of pfpnp complexed with hypoxanthine, ribose and arsenate
this structure was obtained by co-crystallising pfpnp with inosine and arsenate to produce a pfpnp, hypoxanthine, ribose and arsenate complex  . the asymmetric unit consists of one hexamer of pfpnp in which there are six very similar, but not identical, subunits. the crystal packing differs from previously reported structures for pfpnp  <cit>  although the arrangement of monomers is very similar. all monomers in the hexamer have essentially the same overall secondary structure  of equivalent cαs between monomers range from  <dig> – <dig>  Å) with the exception of only one area. this is in the active site loop , part of which forms a short helix in four monomers  whereas this is not present in the remaining two chains .

the active site
although inosine and arsenic acid were included in the crystallisation mixture with pfpnp, the resulting electron density was inconsistent with inosine being present in the active site. the pnp-catalysed arsenolysis reaction is similar to phosphorolysis, however the ribose-1-arsenate product is unstable and is rapidly hydrolysed into ribose and arsenate  <cit>  as shown in figure  <dig> 

in accordance with the shapes, sizes and positions of electron density observed within the active site, the products hypoxanthine base, ribose sugar and arsenate anion  – formed from the irreversible arsenolysis of inosine followed by hydrolysis of the ribose-1-arsenate – were modelled in to the observed electron density map. these proved to be a good match for the density and were well-behaved in subsequent refinement. based on the known sequential mechanism for release of the products  <cit> , the inclusion of the arsenate group correlates with the presence of the ribose sugar which consecutively matches the presence of hypoxanthine. these product and reactant molecules are assumed to be accommodated within the active site in a similar way to enzyme intermediates in accordance with the observed catalytic conformation of the enzyme, including a closed active site loop with the characteristic helical segment and the side-chain conformation of arg  <dig> .

the binding pocket is clearly defined in this structure . in essence, the composition of the pocket is identical to that previously described in the pfpnp structures  <cit> . however, there are important differences in the conformations of several key catalytic residues.

arsenate binding site
in all subunits, the arsenate moiety is stabilised mainly by two arginine side chains  and further hydrogen bonds are formed with donors from the hydroxyl group of ser  <dig> and the backbone amino groups of gly  <dig> and ser  <dig>  these interactions are similar to those observed for the bound sulphate in the pfpnp-so <dig>  <cit>  and the pfpnp-immh  <cit>  structures. however the participation of the arg  <dig> residue in the anion binding pocket, where its guanidinium side chain forms charged hydrogen bonds with the arsenate molecule, has not been observed in structures with sulphate bound  <cit> . despite the inclusion of arsenic acid, this complex was crystallised under conditions heavily buffered to neutral ph  and hence the ionisation state of the arsenate is expected to be the same as for sulphate . similarly, as both crystal structures have been determined at neutral ph no alterations in the ionisation states, and hence overall conformation, of the three arginine residues that dominate the arsenate/phosphate binding site would be expected. in the pfpnp-hra complex, in five of the subunits the arg  <dig> side chain points toward the active site  and forms hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms of the arsenate ion. this conformation appears to increase ordering of the anion and leaves little unoccupied space in the binding pocket. by contrast, in chain f this arginine is in an 'open' conformation with its side chain pointing away from the active site  and hence does not interact with the arsenate ion.

nucleoside  binding site
all six binding pockets in the hexamer bind both ribose and hypoxanthine in a similar conformation with equivalent hydrogen-bond interactions formed to residues in each active site . the ordered active site loop brings pro  <dig>  trp  <dig> and phe  <dig> into the hydrophobic pocket, resulting in the hypoxanthine being oriented by π-stacking and van der waals interactions. similar to the pfpnp-imm complex, the carboxylate group of the asp  <dig> side chain interacts directly with n <dig> of the hypoxanthine, and has been proposed to be the general acid/base for protonation of n <dig> of the substrate in the transition state  <cit> . the conformation of this flexible asp side chain differs from that observed in the pfpnp-so <dig> and pfpnp-ino structures where asp  <dig> points away from the active site and forms hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl group of ser  <dig> 

also of interest is a bound water molecule close to o <dig> of the purine base, which is present in all subunits with arg  <dig> in the 'closed' conformation. this water molecule acts as a bridge linking trp  <dig>  , asp  <dig>  and o <dig> via a hydrogen-bond network , and hence may play a role in catalysis or stabilisation of the transition state. in contrast, this water molecule is not observed in chain f, consistent with a state in which the active site loop is destabilised.

the ribose sugar binds in between the arsenate anion and the hypoxanthine base with its oxygen atoms  fully engaged with hydrogen bonds formed with several residues . the interactions in this region are not significantly different from those previously described in the pfpnp-ino  <cit>  and the pfpnp-immh  <cit>  structures. there appear to be no conformational alterations associated with binding of the ribose sugar, consistent with the observation in the ecpnp structure  <cit> .

in summary, the hexameric structure of the pfpnp complex appears to contain two states of the enzyme. in five of the subunits  arg  <dig> is in a 'closed' conformation and the α <dig> helix is formed within the active site loop. in the remaining subunit  arg  <dig> is in an 'open' conformation and the bound water close to o <dig> is absent.

enzyme kinetics
kinetic data for pfpnp and pvpnp are summarised and compared with existing published data  <cit>  in additional file  <dig>  these data are similar to those previously reported for pfpnp  <cit>  with the exception that pvpnp, unusually, appears to be activated by the 2'-deoxyinosine substrate as discussed below. this increase in rate was consistently observed with both different batches of pvpnp and altered concentrations of the linked enzyme, xanthine oxidase, and hence appears to be an inherent characteristic of pvpnp with 2'-deoxyinosine. the plasmodium pnps are seen to display slightly better catalytic efficiency for guanosine than inosine, consistent with previous reports.

discussion
reconciliation of structures derived from the arsenolytic reaction of pnp with the mechanism of phosphorolysis is complicated primarily by the spontaneous breakdown of the ribose-1-arsenate product. this leads, in this study, to a complex that contains a mixture of products , a  degradation product of the real product ribose-1-arsenate  and reactants . the relative placement of these groups within the active site differs from previous structures of pnp complexes containing products, reactants or inhibitors.

two different forms of the active site are observed in the pfpnp-hra complex. these are distinguished by the conformation of the active site loop, and the positioning of the side chain of arg  <dig>  conformational changes in the active site loop have previously been reported as a distinguishing structural feature between the ground-state  and catalytic-state  of pfpnp  <cit> . in the pfpnp-hra complex, although all active sites are occupied, in four subunits  the active site loop is ordered – indicative of a catalytically-active form – whereas its disorder in subunits c and f may reflect the start of a transition in which the enzyme adopts a 'relaxed state' to release the products of arsenolysis. this is supported by the conformation of the arg  <dig> side chain which points away from the active site in chain f, in contrast to chain c and the other chains where this side chain participates in binding the arsenate group . this has not been observed previously in pfpnp-imm structures  although conformational alteration of an equivalent arginine side chain has previously been noted to correlate with enzymatic activity in ecpnp where the 'open' position of the arginine side chain has been correlated with the enzyme in a non-catalytic state  <cit> . in the ecpnp enzyme the two conformations were also proposed as an explanation for the two different phosphate affinities observed  <cit> .

another feature of the pfpnp-hra active site that provides some insight into the mechanistic state reflected by the complex is the binding of asp  <dig> directly to the n <dig> of the base, an arrangement consistent with its proposed role as the general acid/base for protonation of n <dig> of the substrate in the transition state  <cit> . it has been suggested that this carboxylate-base interaction is exclusive to the catalytic state structure, and is unlikely to play an important role in initial substrate binding  <cit> . by this criterion the conformation of asp  <dig> observed in the present structure implies that this structure of pfpnp represents the enzyme in a catalytic state. this is further supported by the observation of a bound water molecule close to o <dig> of the purine base, which is present in all subunits with arg  <dig> in the 'closed' conformation. this is similar to the reported structure for ecpnp where the presence and absence of the equivalent water molecule correlates with the two states for the active site loop, and has lead to the suggestion that the water molecule might act as a lubricant for the folding and unfolding of the helix in the active site loop  <cit> .

together, these indicators are all consistent with five subunits of the pfpnp-hra complex representing an active conformation of the enzyme in an intermediate state structure. in contrast, the remaining subunit  may represent the structure of the enzyme in a non intermediate state or, speculatively, a state prior to release of the products.

mechanism of plasmodium pnps
the catalytic mechanism of pnp enzymes has been dissected in detail in many previous studies. nevertheless, the pfpnp-hra complex in this study provides an interesting addition to the many crystallographic observations that support a mechanism elucidated primarily by kie studies. firstly, arsenate is chemically and physically more similar to phosphate than is sulphate, which has been used extensively in many of the previous pnp crystal structures. secondly, to form the oxocarbenium ion transition state the c1' atom of the ribose ring is required to move away from the base by about  <dig> – <dig>  Å  <cit>  and then further towards the phosphate ion to form partial bonds to both the purine and the phosphate, a position known as the point of atomic symmetry in the reaction coordinate of pnp, and which is energetically similar to the complex with bound products  <cit> . at this point the c1' atom lies equidistant between the n <dig> of the base and the incoming phosphate/arsenate oxygen nucleophile. this condition is close to being satisfied in the crystal structure of the pfpnp-hra complex, with average separations of as-o <dig> ⋯ c1' of  <dig>  Å, and c1' ⋯ n <dig> of  <dig>  Å. by contrast, the equivalent distances in the pfpnp-immh complex are  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å respectively, and  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å in the pfpnp-ino and pfpnp-so <dig> complexes . the ribose c3' atom is seen to adopt an exo conformation, consistent with the observation for the conformation of iminoribitol group of immucillin h in the pfpnp-immh structure , and has an o5'-c5'-c4'-c3' dihedral angle of 174°. this differs from an earlier suggestion from kie studies that a c3'-endo conformation might be adopted during catalysis . the proximity of the c1' atom to the nucleophile is consistent with a post-transition state arrangement. by contrast, pfpnp-ino and pfpnp-immh complexes are pre-transition state and  transition state conformations respectively. in combination, the series of pfpnp structures shown in figure  <dig> provides a neat series of snapshots illustrating clearly the movement of the c1' atom of the ribose group throughout the phosphorolysis mechanism in pfpnp.

further examination of the association of the ligands with pfpnp also suggests the active site arrangement of the complex may be closer to an intermediate state rather than a straightforward product complex. firstly, the aso <dig> ⋯ c1' distance is longer and the c1' ⋯ n <dig> distance is shorter than those previously described for true product complexes of mammalian pnps . further, by comparison with pnp complexes with sulphate or phosphate, the arsenate oxygen is tilted towards the ribose ring oxygen  in a similar arrangement to that seen in the immh structure . this arrangement in immh is believed to reflect partial charge on the iminoribitol ring indicative of ribo-oxocarbenium ion character  <cit> . in addition, the n <dig> to o <dig> distance of the bound so <dig> is  <dig>  Å in the pfpnp-immh complex, and  <dig>  Å in the pfpnp-hra complex . closer distances in these complexes are generally believed to indicate more transition-like character, representative of transition state formation with significant bond order to leaving and/or attacking groups. finally, the involvement of arg  <dig> in the pfpnp-hra complex distinguishes this conformation from that previously described for the pfpnp-immh transition-state complex.

previous studies  <cit>  have suggested that arg  <dig> not only enhances the affinity of binding of the phosphate group, but also participates in catalysis by stabilising the negative charge of the anion. however, the role of arg  <dig> may be more complex. erion et al.  <cit>  proposed that a basic residue in this location at this position may be involved in preparation of a catalytically active anion containing nucleophilic oxygen, by demonstrating an important role for the his  <dig> residue found in this location in human pnp. this histidine is believed to deprotonate the anion, hence generating the required catalytically preferred ionic state and strengthening the negative charge of the bound phosphate/arsenate anion  <cit> . of the three arginines within the active sites of ppnps, since the immobile arg  <dig> and arg 45' participate in the binding site in both the ground and intermediate states, it appears that arg  <dig> may fulfil a similar role to his  <dig> in the human enzyme, helping to stabilise a negative charge on the phosphate anion and hence leading to activation of the nucleophile in the intermediate state. in the pfpnp-hra complex, arg  <dig> forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds  directly with two of the oxygens of the bound arsenate, consistent with this proposed role. this interaction is absent in the pfpnp-immh structure, in which the arginine side chain is turned away from the bound sulphate, as also seen in one of the subunits  in the pfpnp-hra complex.

in discussion of the role of a similar arginine  in ecpnp,  <cit>  proposed that its structural rearrangement is induced by a tight-binding enzyme conformation, in which a neighbouring continuous helix is broken into two parts, one of which moves in the direction of arg  <dig>  this helix brings arg  <dig> close to arg  <dig>  permitting the formation of a hydrogen bond between arg  <dig> nε·and the·arg  <dig> main chain oxygen. this structural rearrangement is not the case for pfpnp; nonetheless, stabilisation of arg  <dig> is still observed but must result from a different mechanism. we note that the nε atom of arg  <dig> is instead surrounded by several water molecules forming bridging interactions between this nε atom and the o atom of asn  <dig> and oδ2atom of asp  <dig>  as phosphate and arsenate ions are similar in size and – under the crystal conditions – charged, binding of both molecules to the protein is likely to follow the same scheme.

as the composition of the active sites is identical between the pvpnp and pfpnp structures, it appears reasonable to conclude that both enzymes use the same residues and have the same catalytic mechanism. fusing a multitude of previous mechanistic studies of other pnps with the various plasmodium pnp crystal structures enables a generic mechanism for the plasmodium enzymes to be summarised . this differs from the mammalian  pnp mechanism primarily in the identity and contributions of several of the key catalytic amino acids. these include the anion binding site which is formed from three arginine residues in ppnps, whereas from one arginine and one histidine in hpnp; the proton-donating residue is asp  <dig> in ppnp and asn  <dig> in hpnp; residues in the ribose binding pocket also differ particularly a charged glu  <dig> in ppnp relative to the hydrophobic tyr  <dig> in hpnp, and in ppnp there are cavities adjacent to the o5' of the ribose and n <dig> and c <dig> of the base, which are filled by hydrophobic residues for the former and glu  <dig> for the latter in hpnp . these accumulated differences suggest that selectivity for the plasmodium forms should be achievable in the design of pnp inhibitors. this has already been shown with the immh series of inhibitors where the derivative mt-immh has been reported to bind to pfpnp over  <dig> fold tighter than to human pnp  <cit> .

substrate activation in pvpnp
phosphorolysis of most nucleoside substrates by pfpnp and pvpnp in this study followed the typical mechanism described by the michaelis-menten equation – i.e. double reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/ produce linear relationships . however, this was not the case for the reaction of pvpnp with 2'-deoxyinosine. although 2'-deoxyinosine is unlikely to be a biologically-relevant substrate for plasmodium pnp, it is similar to some of the developed pnp inhibitors such as 2'-deoxy immucillin-h and g. substrate inhibition was first considered as an explanation for the non-linearity of the reciprocal plot for this substrate, but the data fitted poorly to the michaelis-menten equation corrected for substrate inhibition ) . plots of v <dig> versus log   also confirmed that curvature was not symmetrically bell-shaped, which is typical for substrate inhibition cases  <cit> .

there have been previous reports of substrate activation of the trimeric hpnp with specific nucleoside substrates  <cit> . the data for pvpnp with 2'-deoxyinosine were therefore fitted to a derived substrate activation equation following the rapid equilibrium method described by  <cit>  and showed an improved fit  leading to calculation of the kinetic parameters shown in additional file  <dig>  it was also noted that a reciprocal plot of 1/v versus 1/ is linear over the low substrate concentration range but turns upwardly concave over a high substrate concentration range . frieden et al  <cit>  noted that for substrate activation cases this curvature is normally downward, although pvpnp with the 2'-deoxyinosine substrate appears to be an interesting form which has also been found in threonine dehydrase  <cit>  and can nevertheless be classified as a substrate activation phenomenon. this distinguishes substrate activation in pvpnp with 2'-deoxyinosine from other examples of substrate activation reported for other pnp enzymes  <cit>  which conform to the classical substrate activation model. application of the hill equation to the first portion of the pvpnp-2'-deoxyinosine data confirmed the existence of positive co-operativity , consistent with the notion of substrate activation of pvpnp by 2'-deoxyinosine, a property not shared by pfpnp despite the high overall structural similarity. however, the mechanism of substrate activation in pnp enzymes, particularly the unusual form observed here for pvpnp, is not evident from the crystal structure. for the other substrates, the 2' hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond  with glu  <dig>  the absence of this interaction when 2'-deoxyinosine is used as substrate might facilitate positioning rearrangements between the ribose and phosphate, hence explaining the increased kcatrate. nonetheless, there is no obvious explanation in the structures as to why this capacity might vary between the pfpnp and pvpnp enzymes, the former not displaying substrate activation.

it is also worth noting that despite strict conservation of the active site composition and structure between the pfpnp and pvpnp enzymes small variations in their enzymatic activities are observed. these might arise through indirect effects from amino acid changes peripheral to the active site region, as has recently been described for mammalian pnps  <cit> . in the assembled dimers of plasmodium pnps the amino terminus of each neighbouring subunit is located close to the adjacent subunit nucleoside binding site. this region has the greatest number of amino acid differences between the two plasmodium enzymes, including a number of charge changes. these substitutions may induce electrostatic changes in the enzyme leading to alterations of the pka values for the active site histidines , a mechanism that has previously been demonstrated, for example, to explain the differential activities of isoforms of human lactate dehydrogenase despite their identical active sites  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
as expected from sequence homology comparisons, the overall structure and active site of pvpnp is very similar to those previously described for pfpnp. however, these structures both differ from the crystal structure of pkpnp in which, despite overall conservation of most active site amino acids, a considerably different active site arrangement is observed. this appears to arise from the extended 159– <dig> loop in pkpnp which protrudes at the dimer interface, changing the subunit association in the dimer and hexamer and, in turn, the binding pocket. it is difficult to conceive, however, that the site could accommodate substrates in this form which may represent an inactive form of the enzyme. the comparability of the pfpnp and pvpnp structures provides confirmation that these are likely to reflect the archetypal plasmodium forms of the enzyme. the close structural coincidence of their active sites, and their similar overall kinetic profiles, suggest that inhibitors targeting one form of this enzyme are very likely to also prove effective against the other. the key features of these sites are summarised in the proposed generic plasmodium pnp mechanism shown in figure  <dig> and in the schematic in figure  <dig> 

although correlation of the active site details of the pfpnp-hra complex with the expected mechanism is not straightforward, several characteristics suggest the complex is more indicative of a post-transition intermediate conformation along the reaction coordinate rather than a true product complex. in particular, the ribose c1' is located close to equidistant between the base n <dig> and arsenate o <dig>  unlike in previous complexes of pfpnp. in this respect the pfpnp-hra complex is likely to form a good representation of the point of atomic symmetry along the reaction coordinate, and as such may provide a valuable addition to structure-based design efforts.

despite the remarkably close similarity between pfpnp and pvpnp, the response of each enzyme to the 2'-deoxyinosine substrate is differentiated by the observation of an unusual form of substrate activation in pvpnp. although the mechanism by which this arises is currently unclear, this observation demonstrates that even virtually indistinguishable active sites can respond differently to some substrates – possibly because of electrostatic effects from peripheral regions. inhibitors that resemble 2'-deoxyinosine might therefore prove less effective against pvpnp. subtle differences such as this may need to be considered during enzyme inhibitor development.
