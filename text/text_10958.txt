BACKGROUND
north american moose, , are the largest browsing ruminant of the deer family cervidae, and preferably inhabit young hardwood forests, deciduous mixed forests, and salt rich wetland habitats that have an abundance of woody browse and salty aquatic vegetation
 <cit> . in northern latitudes, such as vermont, moose have traditionally done well, although unregulated hunting and deforested habitats caused a severe decline in the vermont population during the 20th century
 <cit> . it was not until  <dig> that moose hunting became regulated again in vermont and remains strictly controlled by the state. vermont provides a wide variety of habitats, with one of the most suitable regions being in the northeastern corner of the state. known as the northeast kingdom, the area is rich in bogs and swamps, and is comprised of over 75% deciduous or mixed forests with growth of various maturities
 <cit> . this area also supports the highest concentration of moose in the state
 <cit>  and traditionally has the highest hunter success rates: ranging from 38-70% from  <dig> to 2009
 <cit> , making it an excellent site for sample collection.

like all ruminants, moose have a specialized digestive system with a four chambered stomach that allows a complex consortium of symbiotic microorganisms to ferment plant matter that the animal cannot breakdown on its own, especially cellulose
 <cit> . during the process of fermentation, hydrogen, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and methane gas are produced
 <cit> , as well as volatile fatty acids  such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate. these vfas are released into the rumen where they can be absorbed and used by the ruminant as a source of energy
 <cit> .

limited work has previously been done using classical microbiology to identify organisms found in the rumen of moose
 <cit> . one male moose from alaska was shot in august of  <dig>  and bacteria which were isolated and characterized consisted of streptococcus bovis , butyrivibrio fibrisolvens , lachnospira multiparus , and selenomonas ruminantium 
 <cit> .

for the present study, the second generation  phylochip  was used to survey rumen and colon samples for the presence and presumptive identification of bacteria. the g <dig> phylochip uses 16s rrna gene sequences to rapidly type bacteria and methanogens in a mixed microbial sample without the use of cloning or sequencing
 <cit> . the phylochip contains approximately  <dig>  probes on its surface, representing over  <dig>  species of bacteria and roughly  <dig> species of archaea
 <cit> . there are  <dig>  25mer, probes that are designed to hybridize to each specific taxon, allowing for specificity in determining taxa present
 <cit> . depending on what the probes are designed to target, the phylochip can be used to differentiate between different serotypes of escherichia coli, or determine the presence of a species regardless of strain. it is already a popular bacterial screening method for air
 <cit> , water
 <cit> , and soil
 <cit> , and has recently gained favor for digestive tract samples
 <cit> . due to their specificity and sensitivity, dna microarrays have also been used to categorize diseased and healthy states
 <cit> .

the major objectives of the present study were to type the bacteria present in rumen and colonic samples, and to compare these findings with other studies of ruminants and herbivores. given that moose are large browsing herbivores
 <cit> , it was hypothesized that the bacterial populations in the browse-fed wild moose would be more closely related to bacterial populations found in other browse/forage fed animals. this study reports on the bacteria found in the rumen and colon of the north american moose, as well as how these environments relate to other studies of the gut microbiome in various species.

RESULTS
quantitative real-time pcr
mean bacteria cell densities were calculated for each rumen sample using standard curves generated by bio-rad’s cfx <dig> software. based on a regression line created using the bacterial standards , estimated cell density ranged from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies of 16s rrna/g in the rumen .

all figures based on calculations using standard curves generated by the bio-rad cfx manager program: bacteria .

phylochip array
combined rumen and colon
a total of  <dig> unique otus were used for analysis which passed the fluorescence and the positive fraction thresholds. total numbers for each taxonomic group found are listed for each sample , which represent raw data before initial screening. there were  <dig> total distinct otus that were found in all the samples combined;  <dig> firmicutes,  <dig> proteobacteria, and  <dig> bacteroidetes being the major phyla. not all otus were found in every sample, but out the total  <dig> otus there were  <dig> otus, comprising  <dig> bacterial families, which were found across all  <dig> samples . the most abundant of these families were unclassified, 25%; lachnospiraceae, 20%; clostridiaceae, 16% and peptostreptococcaceae, 7%. the remaining  <dig> families represented less than 4% each of the otus found in all  <dig> samples . the otus with unclassified families were then classified by phyla; of the 25% of otus with unclassified families, the phyla firmicutes represented 22%, proteobacteria and chloroflexi were 17% each, bacteroidetes was 15%, and all others represented 5% or less .

not all otus were found in every sample.
2a.

many of the unclassified sequences were presumptively identified in phylotrac, as well as in genbank, based upon the environment where they were found as most of them are uncultured, thereby providing an interesting, if subjective, means of comparison . unclassified sequences in the moose were related to a range of environmental sequences including  <dig> “termite gut clone” otus,  <dig> “rumen clone” otus,  <dig> “forest soil/wetland clone” otus,  <dig> “swine intestine/fecal clone” otus, six “human colonic clone” otus, six “sludge clone” otus, four “penguin dropping clone” otus, four “chicken gut clone” otus, two “human mouth clone” otus and a large number of “soil clone” and “water clone” otus from various environments. while many of the forest soil/wetland, soil and water clones may represent transient populations that are picked up from the environment, these data correlate with summer diets of moose in vermont, namely woody browse in forested areas and aquatic plants found in bogs and marshes.

rumen samples
the rumen samples contained  <dig> total otus;  <dig> firmicutes,  <dig> proteobacteria, and  <dig> bacteroidetes being the dominant phyla. in the rumen samples, there was a range of  <dig> to  <dig> otus/sample, and an average of  <dig> otus/sample . there were  <dig> otus found across all eight rumen samples and, of these,  <dig> otus were exclusive to the rumen, representing  <dig> families . the otus with unclassified families were assigned by phyla , with the dominant phyla being bacteroidetes, 27%; proteobacteria, 19%; and chloroflexi and nc <dig> with 11% each. nc <dig> is a candidate phylum consisting of uncultivated and uncharacterized bacteria that is currently named after the location where the bacteria were sampled, nullarbor caves, australia. all other phyla represented 10% or less of otus with unclassified families . of the unclassified sequences found exclusively in the rumen, there were  <dig> termite gut clones,  <dig> marine, wetland, or waterway sediment clones,  <dig> fecal or colon clones,  <dig> rumen clones, nine soil clones, and seven sludge clones.
2b, and
2c, respectively.

a previous study on rumen microorganisms in the moose
 <cit>  identified streptococcus bovis , butyrivibrio fibrisolvens , lachnospira multiparus , and selenomonas ruminantium . the present study found streptococcus bovis strains atcc  <dig> and b <dig> in every sample except for 1c and 2r. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and b. fibrisolvens strain lp <dig> were found in all samples except for 3r, 6r, 2c and 3c, whereas butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strain wv <dig> was found in 8c only. lachnospira multiparus was not present on the chip. however, all  <dig> samples did contain lachnospira pectinoschiza, as well as selenomonas ruminantium strains s <dig> and jcm <dig> 

colon samples
the colon samples contained a total of  <dig> otus;  <dig> firmicutes,  <dig> proteobacteria and  <dig> bacteroidetes. the colon samples ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> otus/sample, with an average of  <dig> otus/sample . there were  <dig> otus that were found across all six colon samples, and of these,  <dig> otus were exclusive to the colon, representing  <dig> families . again, the otus with unclassified families were assigned by phyla , with the dominant phyla being firmicutes, proteobacteria and unclassified, 16% each; gemmatimonadetes and chloroflexi, 11% each, and bacteroidetes, 10%. all other phyla represented 10% or less of otus with unclassified families . again, many unidentified sequences were listed as uncultured clones by location found. the unidentified sequences found exclusively in the colon were related to <dig> “termite gut clone” otus,  <dig> “marine, wetland, or waterway sediment clone” otus,  <dig> “soil clone” otus, eight “fecal/colon clone” otus, eight “sludge clone” otus and five “rumen clone” otus.

unifrac analysis
p-test significance was run using all  <dig> samples together and  <dig> permutations, resulting in a corrected p-value of <  <dig> , designating that each sample was significantly different from each other. environment clusters and jackknife values are provided , showing a statistical measurement of the correctness of the tree created. the weighted algorithm accounted for the relative abundance of sequences in a sample, which is typical for environmental samples. unifrac and phylotrac both clustered the rumen and colon samples into two distinct groups: the first node was present 100% of the time in the unweighted and weighted unifrac clusters. the branching pattern for the rumen group is different between unifrac algorithm  and between programs . however, the branching pattern for the colon group is identical between phylotrac, and the unweighted and weighted unifrac outputs. a principal component analysis  scatterplot  was also created using the weighted algorithm, which grouped the rumen and colon samples separately.

the rumen samples also tentatively clustered by age/weight in the unweighted unifrac output , with the youngest/lightest two grouped together , the two 3-yr old females, grouped together , and the three oldest/heaviest males  grouped together with a male of unspecified age/weight. the age/weight clusters within the rumen in the weighted unifrac output  were not the same as with the unweighted output, nevertheless, some clusters remained .

discussion
the major objective of this study was to identify bacteria present in the rumen and colon content samples of the north american moose. this is the first time that the rumen and colon bacterial populations of the moose have been evaluated on a large scale , with the last work published in 1986
 <cit> . while dehority’s
 <cit>  results give the present study an indication of the bacterial population within the rumen of moose, the findings were limited by a sample size of one animal and the constraints of classical microbiology. anaerobic gut microorganisms are difficult to culture, which continues to present a major obstacle in gut microbial identification. however, genetic analysis, such as microarray and high-throughput sequencing, allow microbes to be studied before they are grown in a pure culture.

one drawback of using the phylochip, and indeed with all methods that forego culturing, is the inability to distinguish between live and dead microbes. it also cannot distinguish between colonizing versus transient species, such as the green sulfur bacteria in the phylum chlorobi or green non-sulfur bacteria of chloroflexi, both of which are photosynthetic and picked up by the moose during feeding. careful analysis of the data is required to properly interpret the results. however, even dead and transient bacterial populations can have a profound impact on the resident bacteria as well as the host, whether by releasing harmful components when lysed, such as lipid a, or providing dna which may be taken up by live cells in the rumen, as in plasmids that contain genes that confer antibiotic resistance. is important to take a holistic view to prevent marginalizing potentially important species. like all methods that rely on pcr amplification, phylochip is also subject to pcr bias. this is mediated during sample preparation by running multiple reactions per sample and minimizing the number of cycles.

rumen samples were consistently clustered separately from the colon samples by phylotrac and unifrac and there were  <dig> otus that were exclusive to either the rumen or the colon; confirming that the rumen and the colon are two distinct environments. similar findings were reported in a study using fecal samples from sheep
 <cit> , as a non-invasive means of modeling the rumen bacteria from captive exotic animals where it is impractical to obtain rumen contents. it was concluded that bacterial concentrations and species in the colon were not reliably predictive of the bacterial concentrations or species in the rumen
 <cit> .

the rumen contained an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies of 16s rrna/g . this is comparable to other ruminants:  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/g  for norwegian reindeer
 <cit> ,  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/g  and  <dig>  x  <dig> cells/g  for svalbard reindeer
 <cit>  in april and october, respectively, and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/g  for canadian dairy cattle
 <cit> .

the dominant phylum in the moose rumen was firmicutes with  <dig> otus, followed by proteobacteria with  <dig> otus and bacteroidetes with  <dig> otus. firmicutes is often the dominant phylum in gut microbiomes, and many of those found in the moose were of the class clostridia, containing sulfate-reducing bacteria , which can be pathogenic, endospore forming, and found in soil. sundset et al.
 <cit>  reported that in rumen samples taken from reindeer in svalbard, the bacteria cultivated were mainly from the class clostridia. it was noted that fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus albus, and r. flavefaciens were not found in the rumen of the reindeer
 <cit> , although this may simply be a bias of the cultivation approach. fibrobacter and ruminococcus are both cellulolytic and have previously been found in the rumen of reindeer
 <cit> . however, in the present study, f. succinogenes and r. albus were not found, despite both species being present on the chip with multiple strains. ruminococcus flavefaciens was detected in several samples, but only a few of its  <dig> probes matched, making the result insignificant. ruminococcus obeum was detected in the present study.

in a recent paper studying rumen bacteria in dairy cattle, firmicutes was the dominant phylum in four cattle rumen samples when using full length 16s rrna clone libraries, but was only dominant in three samples with proteobacteria being dominant in one sample when using partial 16s rrna clone libraries or environmental gene tags
 <cit> . gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria have been shown to be type i and type ii methanotrophs, respectively, meaning they utilize methane as their source of carbon. in the present study, the species enterobacter cloacae, of the class gamma-proteobacteria, was found in the moose, and in a non-lactating holstein cow based on pcr of the 16s rrna gene to target methanotrophs
 <cit> .

in a comparison between the moose rumen data and a study using the phylochip and samples from the crop of the wild folivorous bird, the hoatzin
 <cit> , similarities arise. godoy-vitorino et al.
 <cit>  showed that bacteria from the crop of the hoatzin clustered into distinct groups by age: chicks , juveniles  and adults . this correlates with the present study, as the rumen samples clustered by age/weight in the unweighted, and to some extent, in the weighted unifrac jackknife clustering. as in the moose, some of the differential families found in the crop of the adult hoatzin included lachnospiraceae, acidobacteriaceae, peptostreptococcaceae, helicobacteraceae and unclassified 
 <cit> . the total number of taxonomic groups discovered for hoatzin chicks, juveniles and adults ranged from 37– <dig> phyla, 47– <dig> classes, 88– <dig> orders, 147– <dig> families, 305– <dig> subfamilies, and  <dig> to  <dig> otus, an increase over moose, which possibly arises from grouping three samples onto one chip, as was done with the hoatzin samples
 <cit> .

in the study by godoy-vitorino et al.
 <cit> , as well as the current study, otu cutoff level was predetermined by the phylotrac program . however, godoy-vitorino et al.
 <cit>  used a pf =  <dig>  to determine if an otu was present, meaning that 90% of the probes for that otu were positive. when a pf value of  <dig>  was applied to the current study, effectively lowering the number of probes that needed to be positive to be a match for that otu, the average number of otus present rose from  <dig> to  <dig> for the rumen and from  <dig> to  <dig> for the colon. this suggests that moose either have only a relatively few bacterial species in large quantities, or that there is a wide variety of bacteria found in the moose which are unique and unable to hybridize to the probes found on the g <dig> phylochip. the phylochip has recently been shown to overestimate species diversity
 <cit> . the major drawback to using dna microarray chips is that only known sequences can be used as probes, thus rendering the chips ineffective for discovering and typing new species
 <cit> . the g <dig> phylochip was created in  <dig>  thus any new taxa that have been identified since then will not be present on the chip, and any re-classification of sequences that are currently on the chip can only be noted by using the most current version of phylotrac. these data will be validated and expanded upon using high-throughput dna sequencing and cultures.

despite the many similarities between bacteria found in the rumen of the moose to the hoatzin, reindeer and the previous moose study, there are many bacterial families found in the present study which were not mentioned in any of the previous studies. however, many of these bacterial families have been noted in the foregut of the dromedary camel, a pseudo-ruminant with a three chambered stomach. in a recent study by samsudin et al.
 <cit> , the following bacterial families were found in the foregut dromedary camels  as well as the rumen of the moose in the present study : eubacteriaceae, clostridiaceae, prevotellaceae, lachnospiraceae, rikenellaceae, flexibacteraceae, bacteroidaceae, erysipelotrichaceae, bacillaceae, peptococcoceae, and peptostreptococcaceae. wild dromedary camels in australia survive on a high fiber forage diet
 <cit> , which is closer to the diet of wild north american moose. this may explain why the bacterial populations in wild camels appear to be closer to moose than that of wild reindeer, which eat a diet rich in lichens, despite the reindeer and the moose being members of the cervidae family.

in the rumen, there were  <dig> sequences found that were listed as being related to termite gut clones, yet many more similarities can be found between the moose and the termite gut, which have compartmentalized guts containing microbes. treponema primitia strain zas- <dig>  as well as five other treponema species, were found in the moose rumen in the present study, and  <dig> treponema phylotypes and species were previously found in the termite gut
 <cit> . treponema primitia, belonging to the phylum spirochetes, is an acetogenic microorganism capable of degrading mono- and disaccharides such as cellulose or xylan
 <cit> . bacteroidetes, chlorobi, cyanobacteria, firmicutes and proteobacteria clones were also discovered in the termite
 <cit> , as well  <dig> phylotypes which represented three new candidate orders in the phylum fibrobacteres.

to our knowledge, no studies exist using phylochip analysis on the fecal samples of herbivores. however, many other colon studies exist, focusing on medically significant pathogens in humans. in a recent study on irritable bowel syndrome, the bacterial families in healthy rats were rhizobiaceae, peptococcaceae/acidaminocoocus, clostridiaceae, lachnospiraceae, intrasporangiaceae, succinivibrionaceae, alteromonadaceae, paenibacillaceae and flavobacteriaceae
 <cit> . of these, only peptococcaceae/acidaminocoocus, clostridiaceae and lachnospiraceae were found in the moose. in a separate study, fecal samples from cervid species in norway were tested for colon bacteria that were known pathogens to humans using selective culturing techniques
 <cit> . in that study, e. coli o <dig> was found in 41% of the samples, e. coli o <dig> and o <dig> were found in small amounts, and e. coli o <dig> and o <dig> were not found at all
 <cit> . in addition, no cervid fecal samples were positive for salmonella, although one roe deer  sample was positive for campylobacter jejuni jejuni <cit> . in the present study, several samples contained salmonella, e. coli, or campylobacter species, although no strains of verocytotoxic  or uropathogenic  e. coli, shigella or campylobacter jejuni jejuni were found. however, all of the moose colon samples contained citrobacter freundii, a nitrate reducing bacteria commonly found in the environment, which is known to be an opportunistic pathogen in humans.

the moose colon contained  <dig> otus, of which  <dig> were firmicutes and  <dig> bacteroidetes. in a  <dig> study of the mouse gut microbiome in lean and ob/ob obese mice, it was discovered that transfaunation with microorganisms from the obese mouse intestine into the lean mice caused increased weight gain and fat deposition
 <cit> . it is important to note that the bacteria in the obese mice had significantly higher proportions of firmicutes than bacteroidetes
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here provides the first insight into the bacterial populations in the digestive tract of the north american moose. while the g <dig> phylochip is an excellent tool for identifying known bacteria, it contains only  <dig> archaeal sequences, which were not utilized because bacterial-specific primers were used. furthermore, there is currently no microarray that is designed to identify protozoa or fungi. next generation  sequencing is needed to validate the bacterial population findings of the present study, as well as identify the protozoal, archaeal and fungal populations present in the moose rumen. the phylochip, like all methods that do not rely on culturing, cannot be used to differentiate between transient and colonizing species. it can be assumed that some species found in the moose are simply passing through the digestive tract, having been picked up from the environment, and are not colonizing the tract. despite this, these transient bacteria may still have an impact on the dynamics within the rumen, and it is important to take a holistic approach when looking at mixed environmental samples. it is also possible that some of these unclassified bacteria which are presumed transient, such as the soil or water clones, are actually colonizing the moose digestive tract and are simply unique to moose.
