BACKGROUND
genomic studies show that only a small proportion of transcribed rnas represent messenger rnas  <cit> . less than 2% of the human genome codes for proteins, although a large fraction of the eukaryotic genome is transcribed  <cit> . in fact, the encode pilot project provides evidence that almost the entire non-repetitive part of the human genome is transcribed in at least one of the two reading directions  <cit> . in agreement with this, in recent years, there has been reported an increasing number of functional non-coding rnas   <cit> . the discrimination between functional ncrnas and genomic transcription background is a complex problem  <cit>  since ncrnas do not present common primary sequence features. furthermore, recent results show that very short orfs may be translated to yield functional proteins  <cit> , emphasizing that the absence of a long open reading frame alone does not necessarily imply that a transcript functions as ncrna.

most of the "house keeping" ncrna families  and a large class of regulatory rnas  have characteristic structures which perform an evolutionary conserved function. this property can be utilized in comparative genomics approaches to recognize such functional rnas  <cit> . such computational surveys have resulted in the prediction of many thousands of genomic loci with evidence for stabilizing selection of rna structures  <cit> .

despite the relatively high false positive rates of ncrna predictions by programs such as evofold, rnaz, and foldalign all these approaches yield clear statistical evidence that evolutionary conserved rna structure is a pervasive feature of eukaryotic genomes. the experimental verification of the predictions is a complex issue. northern blots, the method of choice for this task, require thousands of copies of the rna molecule for a detectable signal. non-coding transcripts, however, appear to be expressed at much lower levels than most protein-coding mrnas, see e.g.  <cit> . furthermore, some ncrnas might only be expressed for a short time at a particular developmental stage or only in a very specific tissue. an extreme example is the microrna lsy- <dig> in c. elegans, which is expressed only in a single neuron of the worm  <cit> .

expressed sequence tags  represent short subsequences of transcribed rnas. they are produced by an automated and cost effective sequencing mechanism that, however, results in low quality sequences which typically do not cover the complete transcript. the majority of est data comprise poly rnas since the cdnas are obtained using a poly-t primer. polyadenylation is often thought of as a characteristic feature of messenger rnas . mammalian transcriptomes, however, contain thousands of mrna-like rnas that are spliced but do not have appreciable orfs or other evidence for protein coding capacity. this class of transcripts constitutes a significant fraction of the poly rnas, see e.g.  <cit>  and the references therein. computational studies  <cit>  showed that many of these "mrna-like" ncrnas, including prominent examples such as h <dig> and xist, contain local, conserved secondary features, which hint at a functional role for the rna itself.

intriguingly, there is growing evidence of polyadenylation also for classical rnas. the gene ontology has consequently been recently extended by the term go: <dig> "ncrna polyadenylation". several examples come from yeast  <cit> , polyadenylated snrnas have been observed in dictyostelium discoideum  <cit> .

recent studies identified a second nuclear poly polymerase in yeast that is conserved through eukaryotes and tags aberrant non-coding rnas for degradation  <cit> . in addition, a growing number of microarray surveys of different organisms, in which oligo oligonucleotides have been used to amplify the cdna probes, have also yielded hybridization signals from ncrna targets. examples of this are whole-genome  microarray experiments using rna from human  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . even though this method does not provide any direct evidence for polyadenylation, it indicates that the phenomenon of polyadenylated ncrnas is more widespread than previously anticipated  <cit> . therefore, it is of interest to search for both ncrnas that are normally not polyadenylated and mrna-like ncrnas in poly est libraries.

here, we report of the computational detection of novel ncrnas and structural rna cis-regulating  elements in the est libaries of the sino-danish pig genome project  <cit> . an automated pipeline est2ncrna was designed and applied to the assembled porcine est data, which consists of  <dig>  clusters  and  <dig>  single reads . contigs and single reads are collectively referred to as conreads  <cit>  in the following. predicted rna structure candidates are further merged with expression information available in the pigest resource  <cit>  which contains an assembly of more than one million est sequences. one-third of these originates from public available cdna libraries and two-thirds originate from one normalized and  <dig> non-normalized cdna libraries , of which  <dig> stem from developmental stages.

RESULTS
the est2ncrna pipeline  was used to analyse the pigest data. in the following we present our results in terms of the number of conreads that contain at least one high confidence rna structure , because only a small fraction of conreads contains two or more predicted structured loci. see table  <dig> for an overall summary of detected known and novel non-coding rnas and cis-acting rna elements in the pigest data. furthermore, figure  <dig> denotes the number of candidates at each step of the pipeline.

the pigest sequences contain  <dig>  protein-coding rnas which were detected directly by sequence similarity to protein databases, see  <cit> . protein-coding mrnas are expressed mostly in large quantities, hence 80% of them form contigs. with the exception of sra <dig>  <cit>  there are no known structured rnas within orfs, hence we removed the orf regions. nevertheless, the coding conreads were searched for cis-acting structured rna elements in up- and downstream utrs. the remaining orf-free conreads are potential candidates for ncrnas as well as utr elements.

homology search in mammals and few more distant species
the similarity search revealed that  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singeltons are at least partially but uniquely conserved on  <dig>  loci in the cow , so far the most closely related mammal for which a genome has been sequenced. the conserved conreads consist of one-third of porcine orf-free conreads  and  <dig> percent of the protein-coding transcripts . the remaining  <dig>  conreads have no homologous sequence in the cow genome, hence they could not be further analysed by comparative genomics. this large amount of unaligned assembled ests could represent low quality singletons, transcriptional background or pig specific transcripts. at least in part, this large number is most likely an artifact since the current assembly of the bovine genome does not cover the entire genome  <cit> . for  <dig>  pig conreads, we observe split alignments mapping to different loci on the cow genome . 77% of these map to the same chromosome in the same reading direction as one would expect for regularly spliced transcripts . the remaining cases are either est sequencing artifacts, assembly problems in the current release of the cow genome or in the pigests. conceivably some of them are exceptional transcripts such as the ones described in  <cit> .

we then searched for similarities of the pig conreads with the  <dig> other vertebrates aligned to cow in the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . we started from the  <dig>  cow loci that we previously identified as homologous to a pig conread and considered both the pairwise blastz alignments  <cit>  and the multiz alignments  provided through the genome browser  <cit> . we found for  <dig>  loci a similar sequence in at least one additional species. the investigation of cow-human  and cow-mouse  pairwise alignments revealed that significantly more pigest orthologs exist to human. this agrees with the already published thesis that the pig sequence space is closer to human than mouse  <cit> . in the  <dig>  pig-cow specific mappings there are only  <dig> protein-coding conreads  included, which supports the lower evolutionary pressure of orfs as well as their higher conservation. the mappings can be accessed online via the pigest website  <cit> .

known non-coding rnas and cis-acting rna elements
we annotated  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons as functional ncrnas by simple sequence similarity to the ncrna databases rfam  <cit> , rnadb  <cit> , fantom3_noncoding  <cit>  and mirbase  <cit>  . this set includes  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> snornas and  <dig> rrnas. sequence similarity to common cis-acting regulatory rnas was found in  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons, of which  <dig> conreads contain an orf not overlapping the rna database matches. these annotations without the trnas had already been done in  <cit> . see figure  <dig> for an overview of sequential known functional rna structures in pig and there classification in the further pipeline. in addition,  <dig> trnas are located in orf-free conreads  and  <dig> trnas in protein coding conreads .

the ravenna  <cit>  scan using covariance models of known rna structures revealed additional  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons matching  <dig> structures in rfam v <dig>   <cit>  [see additional file  <dig>  table s2). of these,  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons are cis-acting rna elements, of which  <dig> known rna structures are located in protein-coding transcripts and  <dig> in orf-free conreads. again, the most frequently detected ncrnas are micrornas, snornas and snrnas. the total list of known cis-acting regulatory elements contains  <dig> selenocysteine insertion sequences ,  <dig> histone 3'-utr stem-loops, and  <dig> iron response elements. additional trnas are detected in  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons through structure similarity. approximately  <dig> trna candidates were successfully verified by trnascan_se  <cit> . half of these were predicted as pseudogenes which are unusual trna homologues. some functional ncrnas derive from trnas. the most prominent example is the bc <dig> transcript in rodents  <cit> , other trna/sine-derived functional ncrnas were recently described in  <cit> . our collection of expressed trna pseudogenes thus could contain novel trna-derived functional ncrnas.

in summary, we obtain  <dig> known ncrnas and cis-acting rna elements by sequence similarity and structure similarity excluding trna candidates .

candidates of novel non-coding rnas and cis-acting  rna elements
the analysis of conserved pig transcripts by rnaz  <cit>  predicts a high confidence secondary rna structure in  <dig>  conreads  . more than two-thirds of the predictions in orf-free conreads are contigs , even though the input consists of a larger amount of singletons. about 60% of all predicted rna structures are conserved in cow, human and mouse . a representative contig with its predicted structure is shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  the length of the predicted structure elements in orf-free conreads is  <dig> ±  <dig> nt, close to the window size of  <dig> nt used by the rnaz program. the conread coverage rate by predicted rna structures is shown in figure  <dig>  whereas the average structure coverage of coding transcripts is larger ). with slightly more relaxed rnaz criteria , approximately  <dig>  conreads have conserved secondary structures.

a control screen of the rnaz predictions using shuffled alignments as described in  <cit>  yields an estimated false discovery rate  of about 10% for orf-free conreads. the conc program, which uses an svm to discriminate orfs from other transcripts  <cit> , did not provide additional information: conc identified all rnaz predictions in orf-free conreads as ncrnas, which strengthens the rejection of rnas with open reading frames  through the pipeline.

reading direction of structured rnas
the machine learning tool rnastrand  <cit>  classified  <dig> rna structures to exist on the reverse complementary strand of non-protein coding conreads. in contrast, only  <dig> ones have a larger evidence to exist on the positive conread reading direction . a similar proportion of reading directions was observed for predicted rna structures in coding conreads.

mapping of structured rnas to annotated utrs
predicted rna structures, which are similar to known utr regions, are counted as cis-acting  elements. therefore, the more likely reading directions of rnaz predicted loci were scanned against the known gene annotation of human   <cit> .

of the rna structures predicted in orf-free conreads, 86% are conserved in human. we observed that 85% of the rnaz predictions are located far away from any known human gene . these  <dig>  conreads are labelled as putative ncrnas in the porcine transcriptome. the remaining 15%  are homologous to human utrs. here, they are considered as putative cis-acting  rna elements . of these,  <dig> conreads contain a second rna structure which is not similar to a human utr and therefore they are also counted as ncrna. the putative cis-regulatory  elements are located mostly on the sense strand, whereby the ratio of predicted ncrnas on sense conreads is decreased to 29%. however, more than 35% of human conserved secondary rna structures in pig are aligned to the reverse complementary strand of an annotated human utr.

in addition to these we also investigated all the coding conreads, and we predicted high confidence rna structures in  <dig> of these , which do not overlap codon sequences, but are similar to a human utr . these are around 40%  of sense rna structures as well as only 3%  of antisense rna structures of the human conserved coding conreads, which comprise 84% of all rna structures in coding conreads. they are labelled as putative utr elements together with the  <dig> orf-free conreads described above. in total, 82% of the cis-acting  rna structures are predicted in the positive conread reading direction. all high confidence putative ncrnas and cis-acting rna elements are available as the pigest-ncrna webserver  <cit> .

the other human conserved rna structures predicted on the positive strand of coding conreads are putative unspliced intronic ncrnas or false positives. the predictions in the negative reading direction could be further candidates of independent transcriptional units. with slightly more relaxed rnaz criteria, the corresponding numbers are roughly  <dig>  orf-free conreads and  <dig>  protein-coding transcripts which comprise predicted rna structures in regions similar to known human utrs, as well as around  <dig>  orf-free conreads with putative ncrnas.

to summarise, high confidence novel rna structures are predicted in  <dig>  conreads. together with  <dig> known rna structures, the pigest resource comprises trans-acting elements  in  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons as well as cis-acting elements  in  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons, of which  <dig> conreads contain both predictions of trans- and cis-acting elements .

micrornas
using rnamicro  <cit>   on the orf-free conreads having an rnaz match, we obtained mirna predictions for  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. together with known mirnas, these cover in total  <dig> loci. as for rnaz screens, we estimated that the false discovery rate of rnamicro screen is approximately 11%. further details can be found in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  it should be noted, however, that  <dig> candidates aligns to human utrs and should therefore be treated with caution. on the other hand, one of the known human mir- <dig> paralogs is located in the 5'utr of a hoxa <dig> transcript  <cit> . a putative novel mirna structure in the contig ss <dig> -rese12c_n <dig>  is depicted in figure  <dig> as an example.

comparison with other screens for structured rnas
of the rna structures which are conserved in human, 22%  of the ncrna candidates and 27%  of utr elements overlap  a prediction from  <cit>  or  <cit> . these previously predicted structures occur in  <dig> conreads. on the other hand, the porcine transcriptome comprises  <dig> conreads with predicted ncrnas located far away from a human orf and  <dig> conreads with a cis-acting element which have not been reported before.

transcriptional evidence in other organisms
to check for transcriptional evidence in other organisms, we searched in the ncbi dbest  <cit>  database and obtained a huge amount of hits. similarities have been noticed in 73% of the rnaz predictions to ests discovered in other organisms than pig. high significant hits with an identity >95% and rna structure coverage >80% have been detected for 30% of the conreads.

rna structure predictions in known functional rnas
the sequences which were matched initially by sequence and/or structure similarity to known functional rnas listed in ncrna databases, also are passed through the rest of the pipeline as a control. rna structures are predicted by rnaz in six micrornas and four cis-regulatory elements. the latter are confirmed through their homology to human utr regions . in eight cases the genomic location of the known rna and the prediction coincide. with more relaxed blastn options, described in the methods part, we found five additional annotated rna structures  which were predicted by rnaz. nevertheless, there are  <dig> conreads being detected as functional rnas due to sequence similarity, which are not conserved in cow  and could not be verified by comparative genomic approaches.

mapping the ncrna candidates onto the pigest cdna libraries
using the expression information data from the pigest resource  <cit>  we inferred expression of the  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons containing ncrna predictions or matches against rfam , where trna predictions were discarded due to apparent pseudogene annotation in the set. we conducted expression analysis of the corresponding conreads containing ncrna predictions. the pigest resource contains in total  <dig> useful non-normalized cdna libraries from which expression patterns can be extracted. the expression of a contig in a cdna library is simply counted as the fraction of est reads from that library which are assembled into the contig.

using this we found that there are  <dig> such contigs with expression in at least  <dig> cdna libraries . if we require that at least two reads must be present in all libraries, this number reduces to  <dig> . note that additional public est reads can be present as well. of these only  <dig>  contain prediction known from previous scans in human. on the other hand,  <dig> contigs are only conserved in cow. the conserved rna structure in ss <dig> -mixc- <dig> l <dig> , which has the longest conread coverage of all these candidates with 32%, is presented in figure  <dig> 

the fraction of conreads containing ncrna candidates in each cdna library is on the order of 1–2% . intriguingly, we see that developmental and neuronal related tissues in general contain a higher level of conreads with ncrna predictions. it is also remarkable that testes contain a small fraction taking into consideration that testes, brain and developmental tissues are among the most diverse tissues, that is containing most different expressed genes  <cit> . 

discussion
we have implemented a pipeline to detect known and novel evolutionary conserved ncrnas in assembled est data through a combination of several stand-alone bioinformatic tools. as well as making ncrna predictions, it also detects protein-coding rnas and cis-acting regulatory regions  of mrnas. we detected a large number of evolutionary conserved thermodynamically stable rna structures in both orf-free and protein-coding conreads. these conreads are plausible candidates for novel mrna-like  ncrnas, many of which are spliced. the candidate set does not contain, on the other hand, large amount of intronic, poorly conserved, or non-structured ncrna.

surprisingly, the est data – as in other est projects – also contain a large number of housekeeping rnas which are not normally polyadenylated. these are either technical artifacts of the cloning procedure or, more likely, they indicate that ncrnas polyadenylation is a common phenomenon throughout eukaryotes. in either case the data show that est projects provide a valuable source of ncrna sequences. based on the matches to the cow genome, we infer that the predicted rna structures presumably are distributed almost evenly across the entire pig genome . one-third of the predicted conserved rna structures in the pigest resource are located in antisense direction relative to the reading direction of coding gene utrs. one explanation is that we see at least in part expressed pseudogenes that regulate genes through hybridization  <cit> . the large amount of rna structures predicted in the reverse complementary conreads can be explained by the possible existence of overlapping sense-antisense transcripts, an apparently very common phenomenon in mammals  <cit> .

protein-coding mrnas are expressed on average at a much higher level compared to non-coding transcripts. as a consequence we observe that mrnas, in contrast to orf-free ests, are predominantly located in contigs rather than singletons. a high level of conservation of protein-coding sequences between pig conreads and the bovine genome emphasizes the similarities between the mammalian mrna complements. in contrast, a higher rate of ncrnas was predicted in singletons. these ncrnas are probably expressed at low level which is also observed through the mapping to the individual pigest cdna libraries. the sequence conservation with other species is also much less pronounced for the orf-free conreads. these observations are consistent with the idea that the non-coding parts of the transcriptome are much more variable between tissues and species  <cit> .

in our data, the predicted rna structures can be associated with protein coding genes either because the rnaz signal is located on a protein-coding conread or because an orf-free conread shows significant sequence homology with a human utr. the fraction of rna structures in both groups is almost the same, hence they are biologically indistinguishable. one possible reason for the high abundance of utr conreads that do not also contain orfs is that utrs with extensive secondary structures are larger and/or have a higher probability to give rise to truncated ests.

the pipeline could further be improved by including methods such as cmfinder  <cit>  which can search for rna structures in multiple sequences with low sequence similarity. such an approach has shown to supplement methods like rnaz when the sequence similarity is so low that it affects the quality of multiple alignments made from methods based solely on sequence similarity . the expression analysis of the ncrna candidates shows that most of these transcripts are cell-type specific. this observation might in part be due to the insufficifent cdna library sizes. however, we obtained a four fold higher number of predictions in contigs than in singletons, supporting the cell specifity. in further contrast, more than  <dig> ncrna candidates are expressed in at least ten cdna libraries indicating transcription beyond the noise level. strikingly the putative developmental regulatory ncrnas are expressed at the highest level, which in agreement with earlier genomic analyses in other mammals  <cit> . despite the strong computational confidence, only laboratory work can give a final verification.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the computational screen of the pigest resource reported here provides strong confidence for a large number of conserved secondary structure elements in polyadenylated transcribed rnas. the low expression levels of the predicted rna candidates together with the observations that a larger relative fraction of them is found in cdna libraries from developmental stages is in good agreement with the current paradigm of ncrna roles in higher organisms and supports the thesis of functional polyadenylated ncrnas. since these seem to appear in low number in developmental tissues, this in itself provide a plausible explanation of why they previously have been overlooked.
