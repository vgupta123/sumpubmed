BACKGROUND
growth  constitutes a fundamental process in the living cell. it results from the catabolism of available nutrients, yielding metabolic intermediates and energy for the synthesis of cellular constituents. in order to be able to survive in a variety of different environments, a unicellular microbe must be able to regulate the myriad pathways that lead to growth in response to the external nutrient supply  <cit> .

the model eukaryote, saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , has been used extensively to investigate the processes involved in sensing and assimilating nutrients and cell growth. recently, studies have been made integrating nutrient and growth rate effects on the metabolome level  <cit> , whereas previous studies have examined the genes and processes regulating cell growth without making any detailed analysis of specific nutrient effects  <cit>  or individual nutrient responses  <cit> . here, we present a comprehensive, detailed analysis integrating both processes at the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome levels. this  has not been attempted to date.

one difficulty with making analyses of complex systems, such as those governing growth, is that regulation of the activity of a protein or pathway can occur at multiple levels in the cellular machinery. at the transcriptional level, transcription factors and other elements control the expression of genes  <cit> , while many other mechanisms control activities post-transcriptionally  <cit> . to date, transcriptional regulation has been the focus of most studies of nutrient and growth rate responses, due to the ease of gene expression analysis using microarray  <cit>  or deep-sequencing  <cit>  technologies. however, the importance of regulation at the proteome and metabolome levels means that integrative studies incorporating multiple types of data are necessary  <cit> . another important feature of many studies is the use of defined controlled conditions, of which chemostat fermentors are an example  <cit> , to ensure time-course and steady-state measurements are taken under rigorously defined conditions, making comparisons between experiments more robust  <cit> .

in a previous study  <cit> , we characterized a core set of genes, proteins and metabolic pathways subject to control by cell growth rate, irrespective of the specific nutrient limitation by which the different growth rates were imposed. in this work, we aim to use our comprehensive transcriptome, proteome and metabolome data to examine the mechanisms by which s. cerevisiae, as a prototypic eukaryotic cell, adapts its intracellular networks to support cell growth under each specific nutrient-limiting condition.

RESULTS
the transcriptome and metabolome data presented here are as used previously , while the proteome data comes from a reanalysis of the existing mass spectra using updated techniques. in brief, saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown under four different nutrient limitations  at three different dilution rates . gene expression at the mrna level was investigated by transcriptome analysis using affymetrix hybridization arrays. proteomic studies were performed using isotope tags for multiplexed relative and absolute quantification . in this case, the four tags and labeling schema applied  allowed us to test and compare the proteomes of cells grown at μ =  <dig>  h- <dig> with those of cells grown at μ =  <dig>  h- <dig> for all four nutrient limitations. for the metabolome, gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry  was used to analyze the complement of intracellular and extracellular metabolites, that is, the endo- and the exometabolomes  <cit> . all data are publicly available at the manchester centre for integrative systems biology http://www.mcisb.org.

nutrient-specific responses at the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome levels
initially, genes were selected and analyzed based on transcriptional changes between the different limiting nutrients, while growth-rate effects were ignored. the mean expression level for each gene-nutrient pair was compared to the mean expression level across all nutrient limitations for the given gene. this parameter and the other parameters used later to find growth rate regulated genes are shown graphically in figure  <dig>  with the experimental conditions used here, this parameter allows us to compare nutrient-limited with nutrient excess conditions rather than nutrient presence to nutrient absence, as has been done previously. table  <dig> shows the number of genes significantly up and down regulated in each nutrient limiting condition detected using this analysis .

while nitrogen-, phosphorus- and sulphur-limitation led to similar numbers of differentially expressed genes, the carbon-limited state triggered a much broader transcriptional response. genes whose expression is up-regulated in carbon-limitation dominate, most likely as an effect of the release of glucose repression  <cit> .

a gene ontology  slim  <cit>  analysis was made to get a global picture of the functions of the genes involved in these transcriptional changes. functional analysis was performed using a cutoff-free method similar to lrpath  <cit>  that identifies which go terms annotate genes whose expression showed a significant tendency to be up- or down-regulated in each nutrient limitation; all p values quoted are corrected for multiple testing using the method of benjamini and hochberg  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the association of each go slim functional category with up and down regulation at the transcript level in each nutrient limitation.

to complement the transcriptome analysis, we performed a similar analysis using the proteome data. peptides corresponding to  <dig>  open reading frames  were detected. we found that the correlation of the protein-level changes with those of the corresponding mrnas was significant, though weak, in each of the four conditions; although it is considerably weaker in carbon limitation , showing the relevance of post-transcriptional control of cell growth. plots of these correlations are shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  we also calculated the fold change in protein levels for each detected orf between each nutrient-limiting condition and the overall mean level across all conditions. the go_slim analysis performed on these data is shown in figure  <dig> 

the specific response to carbon limitation is reflected in the transcriptional and proteomic patterns shown in figure  <dig>  together with its interrelationship with sulphur metabolism. cellular respiration, mitochondrial functions and oxidoreductase activity are all significantly up-regulated under carbon limitation relative to carbon excess. the go terms that appear most significantly down-regulated under this condition are nucleolar and ribosomal terms such as ribosome biogenesis and assembly. the same biological processes also appear significantly up-regulated under sulphur limitation, along with nucleus, nucleolar, and amino-acid related terms. these situations point to a role for carbon and sulphur availability in regulating ribosomal biogenesis. the fact that genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis and amino acid derivative processes appear up-regulated under sulphur limitation also points to the induction of mechanisms to overcome detrimental effects than may occur when sulphur is scarce, such as biosynthesis of methionine, methionyl-trna and s-adenosylmethionine  and ribosomal rna methylations.

under nitrogen limitation, genes associated with nuclear activities appear up-regulated, along with those in the functional categories cell cycle, organelle organization and biogenesis, and vacuole. genes involved in vacuolar functions are also up-regulated under phosphorus limitation, which points to a role for these organelles in the redistribution of intracellular amino acid and polyphosphate pools under these conditions. as expected, mitochondrial functions and genes involved in cellular respiration towards generation of energy appear significantly down-regulated under phosphorus limitation. terms relating to proteins involved in signal transduction  do not appear to be significantly up- or down-regulated at the transcriptional level, which does not exclude their being regulated post-transcriptionally.

to gain further insight into these results, we performed a full functional analysis on the transcriptome and proteome data using go  <cit> , kegg  <cit>  and yeastract  <cit>  annotations to identify the functional classes, pathways, and transcription factors associated with up- and down-regulation in each nutrient-limiting condition. the full list of significant go terms, kegg pathways, and transcription factors are shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

carbon limitation
although s. cerevisiae can incorporate carbon from a number of different molecules, glucose is always used as the preferred carbon source  <cit> . when glucose is limiting, yeast undergoes a central reprogramming of its metabolism, with changes in the concentration of internal metabolites, stability of mrnas and proteins, activity of enzymes, and the rate of transcription of a high number of genes. genes encoding enzymes such as hexokinase , glucokinase  and glycerol kinase , and transporters such as the high-affinity glucose transporters  are amongst those that show the greatest degree of up-regulation . this group also includes genes encoding transcriptional regulators themselves, such as adr <dig>  cat <dig>  usv <dig>  and mth <dig>  demonstrating a role for transcriptional control in the signal transduction pathways regulating carbon metabolism in response to glucose availability.

at the proteome level,  <dig> proteins show a more than two-fold increase in abundance in carbon-limited conditions relative to the mean abundance across all conditions, including hexokinase , the glyoxylate cycle enzymes malate synthase  and isocitrate lyase , succinate dehydrogenase subunits  <dig> to  <dig> , aldehyde dehydrogenases  <dig> and  <dig>  and the glycogen-debranching enzyme .

growth of s. cerevisiae under carbon-limitation in the presence of glucose and small amounts of ethanol has previously been reported to induce the expression of the enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt  <cit> , and their expression is also subject to glucose repression   <cit> . recent studies by regenberg and coworkers have also shown that these enzymes may appear transcriptionally up-regulated at low growth rates compared to high growth rates  under carbon-limitation with higher glucose concentrations  <cit> . we do not see repression of the glyoxylate shunt enzymes at higher growth rates under carbon-limitation in our data, but the highest growth rate tested here  is considerably lower than the upper limit used by regenberg et al, so this does not conflict with their observations.

the functions and pathways most significantly associated with increased expression and protein abundance in carbon-limitation are related to the different pattern of energy-yielding metabolism under carbon excess conditions  compared to carbon-limited conditions , though glycogen metabolic process is also found to be associated with up-regulation . transcription factors  associated with up-regulation include hap2/3/4/5p , nrg1/2p , msn2/4p , adr1p , cat8p , gis1p , mig2p  and rsf2p . all these tfs are known to have roles in mitochondrial gene expression and the stress response  <cit> .

genes that are down-regulated at the transcriptional level include those specifying the low-affinity glucose transporters hxt1/3p and transcriptional regulators gcr1p and std1p. at the protein level, seven proteins show a more than two-fold decrease in abundance in carbon-limitation ; these include hxt3p, alcohol dehydrogenase iv , dl-glycerol-3-phosphatase  and d-lactate dehydrogenase .

in agreement with the go slim analysis, terms associated with genes showing decreased expression in carbon limitation include ribosome biogenesis and assembly , nucleolus  and rrna metabolic process . down-regulation of expression is also observed for genes regulated by transcription factors such as the zinc-regulated zap1p , the ribosome synthesis regulator sfp1p  and the glucose transporter regulator rgt1p . the significance of these findings will be discussed in more detail later.

nitrogen limitation
many studies on nitrogen regulation compared the response to the presence versus the absence of a nitrogen source, or the relative responses to different nitrogen sources. in our experiments, we study the role of nitrogen abundance by comparing ammonia limitation to ammonia excess conditions.

although the size of the response is less extensive than that to glucose derepression, nitrogen limitation elicits a transcriptional response analogous to that of nitrogen catabolite repression  that involves the up-regulation of a number of pathways  <cit> . genes that respond most strongly include the allantoin pathway genes dal1/2/4/5/7/80; proline-utilization genes put1/2; genes for glutamate-metabolizing enzymes glt1/gdh1; and those for amino-acid and ammonium transporters such as gap <dig>  mep <dig>  vba <dig>  and avt1/ <dig> 

the main up-regulated functions under nitrogen-limitation appear to be related to the vacuole and cell cycle , while up-regulated tf genes include the nitrogen degradation pathway regulator dal80p , and the ncr regulators gln3p  and gat1p 

down-regulated genes include those encoding amino-acid transporters gnp <dig>  bap2/ <dig>  agp <dig> and tat <dig>  and some enzymes involved in amino-acid metabolism such as gly <dig> and lys <dig>  the only proteins showing a more than two-fold decrease in protein expression under nitrogen-limitation are those that are up-regulated in carbon-limitation relative to all other conditions and do not appear to be nitrogen-specific.

phosphorus limitation
similarly to nitrogen-limitation, phosphate-limitation induces a smaller expression response, in terms of the number of genes involved  <cit> , than does carbon limitation. this is, perhaps, due to the small number of phosphate sources that s. cerevisiae can utilize relative to the large number of carbon sources it can assimilate. those genes that are under phosphate control show a strong effect, however, including pho5/8/11/81/84/86/ <dig> and other genes involved in polyphosphate accumulation and metabolism, such as those for the vacuolar proteins vtc2/3/4p. vtc4p also has a more than two-fold higher protein abundance in this condition, along with three other proteins: the aspartic protease yps1p, the purine-cytosine permease fcy2p, and ribosomal protein rpl15ap.

go analysis of significantly up-regulated genes in phosphate-limited cultures show microautophagy  and phosphate-related terms  as the most overrepresented go terms. kegg pathways including significantly up-regulated genes include glycolysis , which is also detected in the go analysis. the gene encoding the phosphate-responsive tf, pho4p, is strongly up-regulated  along with tfs that have roles in dna synthesis and repair such as swi4p .

in contrast to the up-regulation of glycolytic genes in phosphate-limitation, go analysis of significantly down-regulated genes shows that respiration  and several genes encoding respiratory enzymes such as cox5a/ <dig>  sdh1/2/ <dig> and the ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase rip <dig> are down-regulated. as with nitrogen-limitation, the only proteins showing a large down-regulation response to phosphorus limitation are those up-regulated in carbon-limitation .

sulphur limitation
sulphur limitation evokes the smallest specific transcriptional response of the four conditions tested, and few sulphur-specific processes were identified as being under transcriptional control. that said, individual genes with roles in sulphur metabolism such as sam <dig> , oac <dig> , cys <dig> , and met <dig>  are found to be up-regulated in this condition. three proteins had more than two-fold increases in protein abundance in the sulphur-limited samples: the rna-metabolizing proteins, rtc3p and erb1p, and the alcohol dehydrogenase, adh3p. none of the genes for these proteins show a significant change in mrna levels in this condition, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of these proteins in response to sulphur-limitation.

go terms associated with up-regulated genes in sulphur limitation are ribosome and amino-acid related  along with sulphur-specific terms such as sulphur metabolic process  and methionine biosynthetic process . kegg pathways relating to amino-acid metabolism were also found to be up-regulated .

few significant terms were found to be associated with genes down-regulated under sulphur limitation. however, a number of genes encoding proteins involved in the oxidative stress response that use glutathione or disulphide bonds in their mechanisms  were amongst the most down-regulated. at the protein level, three significantly down-regulated  proteins were detected: the isocitrate dehydrogenase idp2p, the essential nucleolar protein mak5p, and the rna polymerase i subunit a <dig> .

the correlations between transcriptome and proteome expression patterns and the results from figure  <dig> show that changes at the transcriptome level are broadly transmitted to the proteome level. however, the correlation coefficients are relatively low, so we expect post-transcriptional control to play a significant role in the response to nutrient limitation. the extent of post-transcriptional control estimated in this way must be considered an underestimate, since many other mechanisms  will need to be studied in order to get a complete picture. previously, we showed that it is possible to quantify the relative changes in translational efficiency between two conditions, for example at two different growth rates, and defined the translational control efficiency  as the ratio of relative change in the level of a protein to the relative change in the level of its cognate mrna between two states  <cit> .

our data allow us to investigate nutritional effects on the tce of each gene. in this case, we compare the change in mrna level in a given nutrient limitation relative to the overall mean to the change in protein abundance in that condition relative to the overall mean. figure  <dig> shows the  <dig> orfs where the tce is more than two in one or more conditions and more than two-fold changes are seen in either mrna or protein abundance. these outliers in the proteome/transcriptome correlation plots may constitute important control steps for eukaryote cell growth, and hence are subjected to careful regulation.

a high tce for a gene in a particular nutrient limitation relative to the others implies that some mechanism is boosting protein levels relative to mrna levels in that condition. conversely, a low tce means some mechanism is reducing the protein level relative to the mrna level. plots of the transcript and protein level changes across the different conditions for all the orfs shown in figure  <dig> are given in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

as expected, all three proteins found to be down-regulated at the protein level in sulphur-limitation also show a low tce in this condition. in the case of rpa14p  and mak5p  there is no significant change in mrna levels in any condition, so the regulation appears to be entirely post-transcriptional. for idp2p , transcript and protein abundance both increase in carbon-limitation ; while in nitrogen, phosphorus- and sulphur-limitation, gene expression levels are similar. uniquely in sulphur-limitation, however, we observe the protein abundance to be very low relative to the other conditions, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation acts in this condition.

three orfs show a high tce in sulphur-limitation: adh3p , rtc3p  and the transketolase tkl2p . again, for the first two, there are no large effects on transcript levels due to nutrient limitation, but protein abundance is more than two-fold higher in sulphur-limitation in both cases. the pattern of changes for adh3p is shown in figure  <dig>  the pattern for tkl2p is more complicated: the level of its mrna is high in carbon-limitation relative to the other three conditions, but protein abundance is approximately the same in both carbon and sulphur-limitation, suggesting that some post-transcriptional regulation occurs in both these two conditions, lowering tce in carbon-limited conditions and raising it in sulphur-limited conditions.

three orfs have a high tce in carbon-limitation: adh1p , vel1p , and hxt3p . adh1p shows a small increase in its mrna level in carbon-limited conditions, but a much higher increase in protein abundance leading to a high tce ). while vel1p and hxt3p have much lower mrna levels in carbon-limitation relative to the other conditions , but the much smaller reductions in protein abundance  suggest that some post-transcriptional mechanism prevents the full reduction in mrna level from impacting on protein abundance.

finally in this section, we integrated data from our endometabolome analyses. figure  <dig> shows those compounds that show a more than two-fold higher or lower intracellular abundance in one or more of the nutrient limitations relative to the overall mean. nitrogen-limitation appears to have a strong effect on the levels of certain amino acids, with decreases in the levels of glutamate, glutamine and alanine visible in this condition. surprisingly, however, levels of another amino acid, cystathionine, are elevated more than two-fold in nitrogen-limitation.

in carbon-limitation, we observe high levels of the carbon storage molecule trehalose, as well as another sugar, maltose. the responses to carbon limitation relating to carbon storage molecules such as trehalose  are discussed further below. we also see significantly lower levels of the tricarboxylic acid  cycle intermediate 2-ketoglutarate in carbon-limited growth. of the other tca cycle intermediates measured, citrate also showed a decreased level  while fumarate, malate and succinate levels were elevated  in this condition, particularly relative to the phosphate and sulphur-limited conditions. succinate for example was  <dig> -fold lower in phosphorus-limitation, just below our cutoff.

the other three metabolites that showed a strong effect are glycerate-3-phosphate, fumarate, and glutathione, which are all observed at low levels in sulphur limitation. glutathione's connection to sulphur metabolism is obvious, and glycerate-3-phosphate is consumed in the first step of the biosynthesis of the sulphur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine. however, the connection of fumarate to sulphur metabolism is not clear.

nutrient- and growth-rate dependent regulation at the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome levels
having identified systems regulated by nutrient availability, next we looked for those regulated by growth rate in each condition. as shown in figure  <dig>  for the transcript data a linear regression of expression levels against growth was made for each gene in each nutrient limitation in turn, and the slope of the regression was determined. table  <dig> shows the number of genes with significant non-zero slopes in each condition. although, as we saw above, carbon-limitation elicits a large change in the expression levels of many genes, the number of genes that are under growth-rate regulation appears to be low in this condition. phosphorus-limitation, in contrast, has the most growth-rate-regulated genes.

for the proteome, we measured the association of go slim terms with positive  or negative  changes, when comparing the two highest growth rates. this is shown in figure  <dig>  broadly, the same effects as those seen at the transcript level are observed, with ribosome-related terms strongly up-regulated across all conditions and proteins with stress, membrane and cell-wall terms down-regulated. results of the full go, kegg and yeastract analyses of these parameters are given in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

of the go_slim terms associated with significant changes in expression with growth rate, none appears to show a qualitative difference between two different conditions . even when the same analysis is applied to all go terms, only four unique terms are found where a significant up-regulation of expression is observed with increasing growth rate in one nutrient-limitation while a significant down-regulation of expression is observed in another. the four terms are: phosphate transport, vitamin b <dig> metabolic process, oxidative phosphorylation and carbohydrate binding.

genes concerned with phosphate transport are down-regulated with increasing growth rate in phosphate-limited cells and up-regulated in cells growing under the other nutrient conditions. the expression profile for these genes ) shows that their transcript levels are elevated at low growth rates in phosphate-limited cells as compared to sulphate-limited ones, but that this difference diminishes as growth rate increases until, at the highest growth rate used in this study , the mrna levels of these genes is approximately the same in the two conditions. in fact, as we discuss further in the conclusion, this effect is quite general and similar effects are observed under nitrogen- and sulphur-limitation, although not in carbon-limited conditions.

of the  <dig> genes annotated with the vitamin b <dig> metabolic process go term, only three show a high degree of congruence with the pattern shown in figure 6: sno <dig>  snz <dig>  and snz <dig>   <cit> . sno <dig> and snz <dig> show the strongest effect and are believed to form a glutamine amidotransferase complex  <cit> . given the pattern of expression in carbon and nitrogen limitation, and glutamine's role in the metabolism of both nutrients  <cit>  this is an interesting observation. however, further biochemical characterization of the function of this enzyme would be required to make any firm hypothesis concerning its role.

as one might expect, given the importance of respiration in carbon-limiting conditions, genes related to oxidative phosphorylation show an increase in expression with increasing growth rate in carbon limitation ). however, our analysis shows that, particularly at the highest growth rate , expression of these genes tends to decrease in nitrogen-limited cells. similarly, genes annotated with the carbohydrate binding term show a small increase in expression with increasing growth rate in carbon limitation, while decreasing in expression in phosphate limitation ).

two proteins show more than two-fold changes of opposite signs in their protein levels in two different nutrient-limited conditions: ser3p and erg1p. ser3p is the 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase that uses the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate to catalyse the first step in the serine and glycine biosynthesis pathway that is active during growth on glucose  <cit>  . compared to growth at d =  <dig>  h- <dig>  ser3p shows a more than two-fold decrease in abundance at d =  <dig>  h- <dig> in phosphate limitation and a more than two-fold increase under carbon limitation. erg1p, a squalene epoxidase that catalyses a key step in ergosterol biosynthesis  <cit> , shows the opposite trend to ser3p, increasing more than two-fold in abundance in phosphate limitation while decreasing more than two-fold in carbon limitation.

we can identify growth-rate related control at the post-transcriptional level by looking for changes in tce between growth at d =  <dig>  h- <dig> and d =  <dig>  h- <dig> for each condition ), rather than between nutrient-limitations as was done earlier. the orfs with more than two-fold tce changes and plots of the transcript and protein level changes across growth rates in each of the different conditions for the orfs shown in figure  <dig> are given in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

as described previously  <cit> , some orfs, such as cpa1p , which is known to be regulated post-transcriptionally  <cit> , show a positive tce with increasing growth rate in all four conditions ). others in this category include the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide -dependent glutamate synthase glt1p  and the mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase adh3p  both of which show small increases in gene expression but much larger increases in protein abundance when growth rate is increased. the growth-rate-linked post-transcriptional up-regulation of adh3p may be responsible for the increased ethanol production observed in all conditions at the highest growth-rate . also, high levels of adh3p are necessary for the oxidation of surplus mitochondrial nadh, produced via the increased biosynthesis of amino acids such as leucine at the higher growth rate. the actions of adh1p and adh3p then act as a redox shunt providing a flux of nadh from the mitochondria to the cytosol  <cit> .

other orfs show nutrient-specific effects. for instance, the ergosterol biosynthesis enzyme erg1p  shows an increased tce with increasing growth rate under phosphorus limitation and a decreased tce under carbon limitation ). ergosterol is a major constituent of the plasma membrane and erg1p, as a specific target of anti-fungal allylamine drugs such as terbinafine, has been well studied  <cit> . another enzyme in the pathway, erg11p, has been reported as potentially being under post-transcriptional regulation in candida glabrata  <cit> , but this is the first report of post-transcriptional regulation for erg <dig> in s. cerevisiae.

from the above analyses, we can see that qualitative differences in regulation by growth-rate between different nutrient environments are quite rare. however, significant quantitative variations in the degree of growth-rate regulation between different conditions are more common, as we show below. to identify genes showing these differences, we used ancova on the transcript data to compare the slope of the relationship between gene expression and growth rate obtained from one condition with the overall slope obtained across all four conditions. figure  <dig> shows the association of go slim terms with these differences between slopes.

the result from this analysis is that, although genes with ribosome-related terms are strongly up-regulated with growth rate in all conditions ), there is a significantly weaker up-regulation in the carbon-limited case . in contrast, genes associated with glycogen and trehalose metabolism, whose expression tends to fall with increasing growth rate, have a much weaker fall in carbon limitation . we describe the expression patterns observed for these two processes below using proteome data where appropriate.

nutrient specific growth-rate effects are observed in other conditions as well. in nitrogen limitation, genes associated with the vacuole, which tend to be down-regulated with increasing growth rate, show a greater degree of down-regulation  while genes involved in amino-acid biosynthesis, particularly of branched-chain amino acids, show a greater degree of up-regulation in this condition . as expected, in phosphate limitation, the slope of regression for phosphate transport genes is significantly lower than the mean  and genes involved in microautophagy and the starvation response show a similar effect . full go, kegg and yeastract analyses are given in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

ribosomal protein production
the transcription of genes encoding ribosomal proteins is highly regulated by both growth rate and nutrient availability. this regulation is crucial to cell growth because ribosome biogenesis accounts for >50% of total transcription in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . the primary regulator of the transcription of ribosomal protein genes is the tf sfp1p  <cit> , which we find  to be strongly associated with the expression of growth-rate up-regulated genes.

carbohydrate storage
carbohydrate storage-related go terms show a strong nutrient-specific growth rate response in carbon-limitation. the genes annotated with these terms are associated both with significantly higher expression in carbon limitation relative to non-carbon limitation , and a weaker fall in expression with increasing growth rate . to better understand this effect, we selected all  <dig> genes from the saccharomyces genome database  biochemical pathways glycogen biosynthesis, glycogen catabolism, trehalose biosynthesis and trehalose degradation and the essential biosynthetic enzyme udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase. from these pathways, a natural division can be made into glycogen and trehalose biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes. figure  <dig>   show the expression patterns for these two groups of genes. the up-regulation of these genes in carbon limitation at all growth rates is clear. it can also be seen that the drop in expression in carbon limitation with increased growth rate is significantly less than in non-carbon limitation. the only gene not conforming to this pattern is that encoding the sporulation-specific glucoamylase  where expression drops a similar amount in all four conditions. sga <dig> is induced to mediate glycogen catabolism in diploid cells during late sporulation, but is not thought to play a significant role in glycogen metabolism during vegetative growth  <cit> .

proteome data were available for  <dig> of the  <dig> enzymes. to assess whether the transcriptional effect was transmitted to protein levels, we calculated the ratio of the protein levels in carbon-limitation to the level in nitrogen-limitation at d =  <dig>  h- <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the distribution of these ratios plotted against the equivalent transcript level ratio. the means of both the transcript and protein log. ratios are significantly greater than  <dig> , confirming that both mrna and protein levels are significantly higher in carbon limitation at this growth rate. figure  <dig> shows the ratios of the protein levels at d =  <dig>  h- <dig> to d =  <dig>  h- <dig> for both carbon and nitrogen limitation alongside the equivalent transcript ratios. in this case, the mean ratios for carbon and nitrogen limitations are both below  <dig>  indicating that mrna and protein levels fall when growth rate increases in both conditions. however, in the nitrogen-limited culture, the mean ratio is significantly lower than in carbon-limitation , confirming that the fall in protein levels is greater in nitrogen limitation.

glycogen storage and release are known to be tightly coupled to nutrient availability, growth and the cell cycle, and the rate of glycogen deposition has been observed to be inversely proportional to growth rate  <cit> . however, this is the first time that this particular nutrient-specific growth-rate effect on the levels of glycogen-metabolizing enzymes has been observed. the transcriptional effect is most likely due to the activation of the transcriptional activators msn2/ <dig> binding to stress-responsive elements   <cit> . the activities of msn2/4p are themselves under the control of both tor and the camp-pka pathways  <cit> , which are both tightly linked to growth control and nutrient sensing  <cit> .

we note from our metabolome data, that trehalose, at least, is found at a higher abundance in the carbon-limited case . however, the difficulty with making further conclusions from transcript and even protein-level data on this pathway is that the activity of glycogen synthase is regulated post-translationally by allosteric binding of glucose-6-phosphate and a series of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes under the control of the camp-pka pathway  <cit> . in carbon limitation, we would expect low levels of the allosteric activator and high activity levels of the camp-pka pathway, leading to low activity of this enzyme and low levels of glycogen deposition despite the high level of expression of these enzymes.

CONCLUSIONS
it is important to understand that the complete biological response of the yeast cell  will always entail the integration of the nutrient-specific sensing, signal transduction, gene expression and metabolic networks together with the core of biological networks responsible for central cell growth.

in the course of this analysis, we have shown that the mrna and protein levels of many s. cerevisiae genes are under the control of a combination of these nutrient-specific sensing mechanisms and growth rate. many of these effects are well known from previous studies, but many unexpected interactions between nutrient availability, growth rate, and regulation have also been observed.

as expected from previous studies  <cit> , of the four nutrients tested, carbon availability has the largest effect on the transcriptional pattern observed. this is due to the release of the effect of glucose repression on many genes  <cit> , as indicated by the enrichment, in the up-regulated set, of those genes regulated by tfs such as hap2/3/4/ <dig> and nrg1/ <dig>  <cit> , and the activation of respiratory metabolism, as indicated by large increases in the expression of genes related to mitochondrial functions. less expected was the interaction between carbon limitation and growth rate that leads to changes in the expression of both the mitochondrial and respiratory genes ), as well as genes relating to synthesis and degradation of carbohydrate storage molecules  and ribosomal biogenesis, whose expression increases less in carbon limitation at the highest growth rate shift , perhaps due to the concentration of cellular resources on mitochondrial biogenesis. carbon limitation is also used as a signal by the post-transcriptional regulatory machinery. the alcohol dehydrogenase gene adh <dig>  for instance, shows a more than two-fold increase in the abundance of its protein product in carbon-limitation while showing only a small increase in its mrna level, suggesting post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are responding to nutrient availability in this case.

the nitrogen-, phosphorus- and sulphur-limitations induce changes in a relatively small subset of genes compared to carbon, and these changes tend to have specific roles in the metabolism of those nutrients. examples include the genes under the control of the dal80p tf that are known to respond to the availability of nitrogen sources  <cit>  and the pho system that responds to phosphate levels  <cit> . sulphur-specific pathways were not found, but individual genes with roles in the production of sulphur-containing amino acids, such as cys <dig> and met <dig>  were detected  <cit> . the expression responses of these pathways can be generalized to a pattern whereby they are up-regulated in the limitation in question, but only at low growth rates. at high growth rates, the up-regulation of these genes is reduced and often removed altogether ). this is in contrast to the effect of growth rate on the respiratory genes up-regulated in carbon limitation, which tends to not only increase in expression as growth rate increases, but increase faster in carbon limitation . to confirm the generality of this observation, figure  <dig> shows the average slope of the linear regression of expression against growth rate for those genes up-regulated in each nutrient limitation . genes up-regulated in nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur limitation all tend to have slopes <  <dig> , indicating that the expression of these genes falls with increasing growth rate, while the mean slope of genes up-regulated in carbon limitation is not significantly different from  <dig>  this observation may reflect the unique role of glucose as both a biosynthetic material and an energy source, while the other nutrients are purely biosynthetic.

at the growth rate level, ribosome synthesis is the dominant process in all conditions - in keeping with its position as the single most powerful consumer of both the energy and the biosynthetic resources required for growth  <cit> . this process is heavily regulated at the transcriptional level, principally by the transcriptional activator sfp1p  <cit> , which is downstream to, and a feedback regulator of, the central growth-rate-regulating kinase tor  <cit> . it is not surprising, therefore, that we find genes related to ribosomal synthesis transcriptionally regulated by a complex mix of nutrient and growth-rate effects, with carbon, nitrogen and sulphur limitation all showing similar but distinct patterns of expression . with our proteome data, we are able to confirm that at least some of these effects, including a significantly lower rate of synthesis of cytosolic ribosome levels at the highest growth rate under carbon limitation , are subsequently transmitted to protein levels.

the integration of proteome and transcriptome data also gives an important insight into post-transcriptional regulation due to both nutrient and growth-rate effects. while adh1p, for example, shows evidence of nutrient mediated post-transcriptional regulation, another alcohol dehydrogenase  shows strong growth rate mediated regulation. the detection of differential post-transcriptional regulation between carbon and phosphate-limited conditions for a gene involved in ergosterol biosynthesis  suggests that this pathway is regulated both by nutrient-sensing and growth-rate. another biosynthetic enzyme, ser3p, also appears to be differentially regulated by different nutrients in response to growth rate. ser3p is part of a biosynthetic pathway leading to serine that is only active during growth on glucose  <cit> . the increase in ser3p levels with increasing growth rate in carbon-limitation is interesting therefore, especially when contrasted with the situation in phosphate-limited growth, where ser3p levels fall with increasing growth rate.

with regard to future work, although we are beginning to form a picture of the processes under nutrient and growth-rate control, the static snapshots that these measurements represent cannot truly reflect the inherently dynamic nature of metabolism and cell growth. a better understanding of these processes will require the integration of these data with dynamic measurements of pathway fluxes  <cit> . this will be necessary for both metabolic and signaling pathways, since the activity of many pathways is not determined by the levels of their protein components, but by the activity of those components, which are often controlled at a post-transcriptional  level. a more complete perspective would also require the integration of high-throughput data with information from molecular studies and screenings with mutants.

in conclusion, we have presented an integrated view of the transcriptional, translational, and metabolic responses of a eukaryotic cell to nutrient supply and growth rate. we show that each of the nutrients investigated induces a specific response at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level and alters the response of many genes to changes in growth rate. we also show that carbon induces both a unique response and a unique pattern of response, possibly due to its role as both an energy source and a biosynthetic compound. our integrated analysis also allows us to identify many novel examples of nutrient- and growth-rate-regulated post-transcriptional controls.
