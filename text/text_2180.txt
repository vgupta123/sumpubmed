BACKGROUND
in order for winter cereals to switch from vegetative to reproductive phase, they must undergo a low temperature regime described as veranlization. recessive alleles at the major vrn loci  results in winter wheat and a dominant allele at one or more of these loci results in spring wheat  <cit> . the low non-freezing temperatures needed for vernalization are also needed for cold acclimation which is defined as the period of exposure to low non-freezing temperatures necessary for freeze survival.

cold acclimation for wheat is usually 2–4°c for 4– <dig> wk  conditions. the ability to survive freezing temperatures has been represented by various terms including frost tolerance, winter hardiness, frost hardiness, freezing tolerance, freeze survival, cold resistance and freeze resistance. for consistency, we use the term freeze resistance as was done in our report on water loss by hard red winter wheat during cold acclimation  <cit> . the fr loci which have been linked to freeze resistance have been mapped to all  <dig> genomes on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> in close approximation to the vrn loci  <cit> . therefore, attempts to identify genes linked to freeze resistance by comparing gene expression between winter and spring types have been confounded by the involvement of the vrn loci which is also low-temperature regulated.

in an attempt to reduce the vrn loci contribution to the study of freeze resistance in winter wheat, various near isogenic lines  for the vrn- <dig> genes have been generated. these include: two vrn- <dig> nils developed from the sping cv. 'triple dirk'  <cit>  and another set developed from the spring cv. manitou  and the winter cv. norstar  <cit> . in this study, in order to normalize for the involvement of the vrn loci, we made use of two winter wheat mutant lines that vary in freezing survival  <cit> . we refer to the lines as freeze resistant  or freeze susceptible  based on their ability as a result of cold acclimation to withstand freezing temperatures in the fields .

the percentage survival reported represents the average of two replications. the mean height for these lines were obtained from three replications at two locations in sd.

a significant body of research exists that describes the involvement of cor/lea genes during cold acclimation in cereals. a few of these include cold acclimation of barley and wheat  <cit> . we have contributed to these studies by examining the effect of cold acclimation on aba-regulated barley genes such as hva <dig>  <cit>  and wheat genes not regulated by aba such as tacr <dig>  <cit> . wheat ests are available for functional genomics  <cit>  and include wheat cor/lea genes known to be controlled by an aba-independent pathway: wcor <dig>  wcor <dig>  wcs <dig>  wlt <dig>  and wcs <dig>  <cit>  and others that respond to cold acclimation through an aba-dependent pathway: wrab <dig>  wrab <dig>  wrab <dig> and wcor <dig>  <cit> .

an understanding of the role of the cor/lea genes can be better achieved if the length of cold acclimation and the tissue used for cold acclimation is defined more carefully. ganeshan et al  <cit>  have demonstrated that wcor <dig> levels in leaf tissue of winter norstar declined by  <dig> d of cold acclimation, whereas wcor <dig> levels were sustained to  <dig> d cold acclimation of crown tissue. knox et al  <cit>  reported no differential expression with 12°c treatment of crown tissue from wheat lines varying in freeze resistance. in our study, we were particularly interested in understanding sustained 4°c cold acclimation for at least  <dig> wk  and specifically we wished to understand the gene expression levels in the crown tissue, the most freeze resistant part of the plant  <cit> .

with the identification of many cor/lea genes, researchers concluded that a better understanding of the role of such genes in freeze resistance could be ascertained by determining how these genes are regulated at the transcriptional level. such studies led to the discovery of c-repeat/dehydration-responsive elements  in the promoter region of the cor/lea genes <cit>  and the identification of the proteins that bind the crt/dre as crt-binding factor/dre-binding proteins  <dig>   <cit> . the involvement of cbfs in the cold acclimation process has been described  <cit> .

vagujfalvi et al.,  <cit>  using cbf gene specific primers examined the response of cbf genes in t. aestivum. they reported that a  <dig> hr, 2°c  treatment caused a four-fold induction of genes tacbf- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> in frost tolerant lines harboring the frost tolerant allele cnn fr-a <dig>  compared to the frost sensitive lines. stockinger et al  <cit>  studying cbf gene expression in barley reported that hvcbf- <dig> and - <dig> were expressed to higher levels in frost tolerant lines harboring the 'nure' fr-h <dig> allele than in the frost sensitive 'tremois' fr-h <dig> allele. the wheat species t. aestivum and t. monococcum have been reported to contain around ten cbf groups of which groups cbfiiid, iva, ivb, ivc and ivd were induced to higher levels in the winter cultivar in response to lt  <cit> . these researchers postulated that the higher inherited and lt inducible cbf expression may mean that these cbf groups are major components for control of wheat to develop freezing resistance.

miller et al  <cit>  generated seven recombination events within the cbf cluster located in the fr-a <dig> allele by crossing t. monococcum genotypes dv <dig>  with g <dig> . these recombination events were studied by knox et al  <cit>  who described three gene clusters at the fr-a <dig> locus of t. monococcum. these were designated:  proximal ;  central  and  distal . from the frost tolerance data generated by knox et al., <cit> , the locus for frost tolerance was completely linked to the central gene cluster .

we used the affymetrix wheat chip for comparative transcriptome analyses between an fr and an fs line with rna from non-acclimated and long-term cold acclimated  winter wheat crown tissue. in this report we highlight the behavior of the cbf genes of the fr-a <dig> loci and propose a model for their involvement in confering freeze resistance.

RESULTS
comparative transcriptome profiling
transcript levels were averaged for two technical replicates each consisting of three pooled biological replicates. fr represents the freeze resistant line  and fs represents the freeze susceptible line . heat maps are presented in the respective section. the colors red and green are used to indicate up-regulation and down-regulation respectively in response to cold acclimation relative to non-acclimated control samples. the black color represents no change in gene expression in response to cold acclimation. the microarray data has been deposited at the plant expression database  accession number ta <dig>  the data has also been deposited in the geo database, accession # = gse <dig> .

winter habitat mutant lines
a distinction between winter and spring habitat can be made based on the expression of various vrn genes, , and the genes for the vernalization transcription factors tavrn1/tavrt- <dig> and tavrt- <dig> in response to cold acclimation. the transcriptome analyses data for these five genes are depicted in figure  <dig>  genes, , showed greater than 8-fold regulation to the same extent in fr as fs with cold acclimation relative to the control non-acclimated samples. tavrt- <dig> was expressed to 4-fold levels in both fr and fs. tavrn <dig> was not induced with cold acclimation in either fr or fs lines.

cbf genes expression patterns
as seen in figure  <dig>  transcript levels for  <dig> cbfs identified on the chip appeared to fall into three basic categories. category i: those with very low levels of expression in the crown tissue of both fr and fs lines with and without cold-acclimation . category ii: cbfs that are up-regulated with cold acclimation in both fr and fs lines . category iii: cbf genes that are upregulated in cold-acclimated fr crown tissue but not in cold-acclimated fs crown tissue . all expression levels are presented as relative to the control non-acclimated samples.

cor/lea genes expression patterns
transcription levels of  <dig> cor/lea genes including aba-dependent  and aba-independent  cor genes are depicted in figure  <dig>  relative to the non-acclimated control samples, these cor/lea genes were up-regulated in fr and fs cold-acclimated crown tissue and there was also no significant difference between the pattern of expression of the aba -dependent and -independent genes sampled.

expression analyses by real-time qrt-pcr
the pattern of gene expression from the microarray was verified by examining the relative transcript levels for candidate cbf genes normalized to the 18s ribosomal transcript levels by real time qrt-pcr. since our criterion for relatedness to freeze resistance is based on differential expression between fr and fs lines, we present rt-pcr data on members of the cbfs that were differentially regulated. as seen in figure  <dig> , the high level expressing cbf genes of this group are cbf- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  since cbf- <dig> and - <dig> are very similar but different from cbf- <dig> and - <dig>  wechose to examine by rt-pcr cbf- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  the results are depicted in figure  <dig>  as viewed by relative quantity  all three genes were not significantly expressed in control or non-acclimated fr and fs tissue. however all three were upregulated in response to  <dig> wk cold acclimation of fr crown tissue but not significantly changed from baseline expression in  <dig> wk cold-acclimated fs crown tissue. the pattern of expression was similar to that observed from the microarray.

discussion
normalization of vernalization requirement
we believe that studies to unravel the basis of freeze resistance in winter wheat are confounded by the use of comparisons between winter and spring cultivars. therefore, we designed our experiments to normalize for the contribution from the vrn loci by using two winter types derived from the same starting winter cultivar. our comparison of vrn gene expression between fr and fs with cold acclimation  leads us to conclude that the mutagenesis procedure used to generate these lines did not affect the molecular basis of the winter habitat.

expression of cbf genes at the fr loci between fr and fs lines
having verified that the vrn genes were being expressed to the same levels in fr and fs lines in response to cold acclimation, we could now examine the expression of the cbf gene clusters described by badawi et al  <cit>  and knox et al  <cit> . in particular we queried the cbf genes that were available on the affymetrix wheat chip that had been mapped to the long arm of t. aestivum chromosome  <dig>  according to badawi et al  <cit>  the cbf genes at the fr loci included cbf- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  however, according to knox et al.,  <cit>  the cbfs at the fr loci are cbf- <dig> - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> - <dig>  - <dig> - <dig> and - <dig>  these researchers identified cbf- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> as not belonging to the frost tolerance gene clusters. our data leads us to agree partially with knox et al.,  <cit> . genes not differentially expressed between fr and fs lines in our system are assumed to be not associated with freeze resistance. thus like knox et al.,  <cit>  we place cbf- <dig> and - <dig> as unassociated with winter wheat freeze resistance. however we disagree with the findings of knox et al.,  <cit>  relative to cbf- <dig> and - <dig>  in our system, the cbf genes differentially regulated between fr and fs lines included cbf- <dig> and - <dig>  these were described by knox et al.,  <cit>  as belonging to the unlinked cluster. we also observed differential expression for genes from the central  and distal  clusters on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> . additionally cbf <dig> was identified as differentially regulated between fr and fs . however, it is not located on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  thus, the relationship of cbf <dig> to the other cbf genes that map to the fr loci will be of interest in determining the role of cbfs in other plant responses other than freeze survival or the identification of other loci that associate with the fr loci to confer freeze resistance.

cbf, cor/lea gene expression pattern comparisons in fr and fs lines with cold acclimation
from expression data, it is possible to cluster genes that are co-expressed in response to a stimulus. co-expression usually suggests coordinated gene transcription and allows for the identification of transcription factors and the genes that they regulate. comparisons of co-expression have been performed to identify transcription factors  <cit>  and biosynthetic enzymes  <cit> . these findings led us to attempt to identify which of the cor/lea genes are controlled by which cbfs by comparing the expression patterns of the cbfs with the cor/lea expression patterns. if a similar pattern of expression is an indicator of coordinated gene transcription then we can deduce from our results that the sample of cor/lea genes examined that belong to both the aba-dependent and aba-independent pathways are coordinately regulated . and since the pattern of expression of these cor/lea genes is similar to that of cbf- <dig> and - <dig> then we can assume that cbf- <dig> and - <dig> encode the cbfs that control the expression of this cluster of cor/lea genes.

relationship between vrn genes and cor/lea genes
another set of genes with similar expression patterns with the cor/lea genes were the vrn genes . this co-expression pattern suggests that the cor/lea up-regulation may be via the vrn genes signaling pathways. this hypothesis is supported by the findings of danyluk et al.,  <cit>  that the vrn-a1/vrn-a <dig> locus regulates cor/lea gene induction. we propose that this sample of cor/lea genes are regulated by vrn-a <dig> -b <dig> and -d <dig> genes during cold acclimation. it will be of value to determine the relationship between the coordinated expression of the cbf- gene set  and the vrn - gene set . the differential cbf gene expression levels observed for cbf- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> did not correlate with gene expression patterns for any of the highly expressed cor genes examined. thus we can assume that at  <dig> wk cold acclimation these cbf genes were not involved in regulation of this group of cor genes.

relationship between cold acclimation-induced expression of cbf and freeze resistance of fr and fs lines
to unravel the complex inter-relationship between the cbf genes, cold acclimation and freeze resistance we propose the following model. we propose that one of the cbf genes belonging to the central cluster  may serve as a key regulator of other genes including other cbf genes. for simplicity we designate that key regulator as cbf-k and we designate the target cbf genes as cbf-t. possible cbf-ts would include cbf- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> which then control expression of down-stream target genes designated tgs. we propose that with cold acclimation, cbf-k can be activated resulting in the production of functional cbf-k which activates downstream genes to produce the fr phenotype . the fs phenotype could be generated from the fr phenotype by a "loss of function" mutation as a result of mutagenesis. this could be achieved if the cbf-k activator binding site is mutated resulting in low-level to no increase in transcription of the cbf-k gene .

however, because wheat is hexaploid, and the fr line has a significant increase in survival compared to the wt or the fs line , we believe that we are observing the effects of a "gain of function" mutation. it is possible that in fs lines, cbf -k is repressed by an external factor or by autoregulation and as a result cbf-t and its tgs are not activated . the azide mutagenesis could have resulted in either a mutation in the repressor binding site for cbf-k or a mutation to the repressor domain, allowing for an active cbf-k and therefore activation of the downstream genes that lead to the freeze survival properties expressed by fr lines .

future studies will allow us to determine whether cbf- <dig> and/or - <dig> play a key role in conferring freeze resistance by any of the possible mechanisms proposed and whether cbf- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are target genes or master switches.

CONCLUSIONS
the fr and fs lines used in this study will serve as valuable tools for analayzing freeze resistance of hrww and genes differentially expressed between fr and fs lines. the cbf genes  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are potential markers for freeze survival of hrww.
