BACKGROUND
the order scorpaeniformes is a diverse group of species that include the rockfish, greenling, sculpins and sablefish among others. grouped originally by the presence of the suborbital stay, a posterior extension of the third circumorbital bone  <cit> , the order is now considered to be paraphyletic with members of the orders perciformes and gasterosteiformes  <cit> . while a number of species among the currently defined order are considered commercially important, the most economically valuable in north america is the sablefish, anoplopoma fimbria.

the sablefish, also known as alaskan black cod, is a long-lived demersal species located mainly between 200- <dig> m along the continental shelf of the north pacific ocean  <cit> . while found from eastern japan through alaskan waters and down to baja california in mexico  <cit> , the sablefish is most important to american and canadian commercial fisheries, with sablefish landings exceeding $ <dig> million value on a combined harvest of  <dig>  metric tonnes in  <dig>  <cit> . sablefish is also in the preliminary stages of commercial aquaculture, with farms in british columbia already producing  <dig> tonnes in  <dig>  <cit> . while commercially important, little genetic information is available, with genetic resources limited to a few sequences and  <dig> microsatellite primer pairs  <cit> . indeed little is known about the  <dig>  species  <cit>  within the economically important order scorpaeniformes.

for the successful development of sablefish as a sustainable species in aquaculture and the protection of wild fisheries stocks, modern molecular tools could be of great value. the identification and exploitation of genetic markers can be used in the characterization and identification of strains, parental identification and analysis of diversity in the broodstock or in the construction of a linkage map  <cit> . linkage maps have been developed for numerous fish species including atlantic salmon  <cit> , channel catfish  <cit> , common carp  <cit> , grass carp  <cit> , atlantic halibut  <cit>  and gilthead sea bream  <cit> . while traditionally maps were developed with markers such as allozymes, aflp and rapd markers, microsatellites and snps are the current markers of choice. microsatellites are relatively abundant, highly polymorphic and easy to genotype, and snps, while less informative due to a limit of two  alleles per locus, are easily identifiable and are the marker of greatest abundance in the genome. with advances in next-generation sequencing  protocols such as rad mapping  <cit>  and genotyping-by-sequencing  <cit>  it is possible to generate a dense snp map of primarily anonymous markers  with relatively little prior dna sequence information. having markers linked to genes  rather than anonymous sequences, however, allows for the putative placement of genes on a linkage map, which can make them of greater use than type ii markers in linkage mapping for aquaculture species  <cit> . type i markers, both microsatellites and snps, can easily be identified in libraries of expressed sequences, either through traditional est library sequencing or through ngs transcript sequencing methods such as rnaseq. while linkage maps can have many uses, one of the most useful is in mapping phenotypes to a map in an effort to identify the genes controlling phenotype and look for associations or linkage between traits. for single locus phenotypes, the phenotype can be scored and analyzed in the way a genetic marker would; multi-locus phenotypes require more powerful quantitative trait loci  analyses to statistically predict regions of interest.

of the phenotypes often identified through mapping, sex is one of the most important and most common for many species. sexual dimorphism is of particular significance as one sex can often grow larger or faster, both important traits to understand in fisheries and aquaculture. while mapping of the sex phenotype to a chromosome is relatively easy given a single-locus sex determination system, mapping the sex phenotype to a gene has been more difficult, and the master sex determinant has only been identified in a few fish species. dmy determines sex in medakas oryzias latipes <cit>  and o. curvinotus <cit> , amhy in the patagonian pejerrey odontesthes hatcheri <cit> , and sdy in most salmonids  <cit> . these master sex determining genes  are the result of divergent duplicated copies of autosomal genes, present only on the y-chromosome. gsdfy in the medaka oryzias luzonensis, on the other hand, is up-regulated in males during sexual differentiation, due to changes in the upstream promoter region  <cit> , while the male-specific amhr2y in  <dig> species of takifugu appears to be the result of a single coding change  <cit> . while all these genes have been previously described as playing a role in sexual determination , none so far have been described as the master sex determinants in distantly related groups of fish.

comparative mapping  <cit>  can be used to facilitate comparison of newly developed maps to pre-existing genomic resources to augment available genetic information. comparison between non-model fish species and those with a fully-sequenced reference genome has identified significant conserved synteny in numerous species  <cit> . with preliminary or complete whole-genome assemblies available for ten bony fish species   <cit> , and the increasing ease with which genetic information and complete genomic sequences can be obtained, comparative mapping will only become easier. the degree to which the identification of conserved synteny will be useful depends on how closely related the two species are; thus, for species of relatively close ancestry and significant macro-synteny, comparative mapping can be used to predict gene locations and order, and provide a list of potential candidates responsible for a particular phenotype or underlying a qtl.

in this work, we describe the sequencing of the mitochondrial genome and the resultant verification of the phylogenetic placement of the sablefish within the scorpaeniformes. we present a library of assembled transcript sequences to identify genes, and use them to develop type i polymorphic snp and microsatellite markers. the markers were scored across two families and used to produce the first-generation sablefish linkage map and locate the sex phenotype onto the male map. we show significant conserved synteny between the threespine stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus and sablefish, and use a comparative mapping approach to predict gene locations in the sablefish. an additional collection of markers, mainly type ii snps are identified through genotyping-by-sequencing and used to identify sex-specific markers and sequence insertions immediately upstream of a known master sex determinant.

RESULTS
gene identification
in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of the gene sequences of sablefish, we examined transcriptomes by est sequencing and rnaseq. in total,  <dig>  cdna clones were sequenced in both forward and reverse directions. following trimming and removal of any contaminants,  <dig>  est sequences were obtained, and deposited in the genbank est database under accessions genbank:go615858-go <dig>  est sequences were assembled into  <dig>  unique contigs using phrap assembly.  <dig>  full length gene sequences were submitted as genbank:acq57837–acq <dig>  genbank:c3khg <dig>  genbank:c3kjf <dig>  genbank:c3khf <dig> and genbank:c3kje <dig>  a 3’ utr analysis of all contigs was used for primer design in the search for polymorphic markers. rnaseq yielded  <dig> , <dig> reads, which were assembled into  <dig>  unigene sequences. combined with the est sequencing data into ncbi tsa bioproject  <dig>  the assembled data produced  <dig>  contigs >400bp; these can be found in accession numbers genbank: jo657891-jo <dig> 

the uploaded est and tsa datasets represent all but  <dig> of the  <dig>  sequences for sablefish in the ncbi nucleotide and est databases . in addition, sablefish is currently the scorpaeniformes species with the largest percentage of sequences in both the est  and nucleotide databases . this work represents a very significant increase in the available expressed sequence data for the sablefish, as well as for the order scorpaeniformes in general.

the mitochondrial genome and phylogenetic placement of sablefish
in order to help resolve the general phylogenetic placement of sablefish we sequenced its mitochondrial genome and used a phylogenetic tree analysis to compare it to other percomorpha and scorpeaniformes. the sablefish mitochondrial genome, seen in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  consists of  <dig>  base pairs, encompassing  <dig> genes,  <dig> ribosomal rnas and  <dig> trnas, with all features following the order of the typical vertebrate mitochondrial genome . the sequence was submitted to ncbi as genbank: jx <dig> 

the phylogenetic analysis of the mitogenome sequences produced the same major phylogenetic groupings as in kawahara et al.  <cit> , so we focused on the grouping of scorpaeniformes, zoarcoidei, and gasteroidei. as seen in figure  <dig>  we recovered a very similar set of phylogenetic placements for the species previously analyzed . additionally, we recovered a similar phylogenetic ordering of the gasterosteiformes mitogenomes  <cit> . the sablefish mitogenome was placed in an ancestral branch prior to the split of the scorpaeniformes family cottidae from the most-closely related gasterosteiformes and perciformes families, although the bootstrap value of this placement is not strong.

the anoplopomatidae is a family comprising two known species, the sablefish and the skilfish  placed in the order scorpaeniformes. molecular  and morphological  <cit>  analyses both suggest a closer relationship between sablefish and the cottoids than to the scorpanoids, but the exact placement remains unclear. while our analysis agrees with that of smith and wheeler  <cit>  in suggesting a relatively ancestral branch for the divergence of the sablefishes, our results disagree on whether divergence occurred before or after  the divergence of the cottoids from the gasterosteodei and the zoarcoidei; both analyses produce weak branch support in favour of the respective positions. given the difficulty in accurately placing deep phylogenetic branches, a definitive molecular placement of the anoplopomatidae will await further data.

while the exact placement of the anoplopomatidae remains to be determined, sablefish represent an older unique branch that split at or around the split of cottoidei and gasterosteodei. this is of particular interest as one member of the gasterosteodei, the threespine stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus, has a fully sequenced draft genome available for comparison. the stickleback is without question the most closely related species for which a well annotated whole genome is available. previous estimates based on mitochondrial genomes place the time of divergence of the more ancestral suborder scorpaenoidei from the cottoidei and gasterosteodei at approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> , meaning the divergence of sablefish from stickleback lineages could be less than  <dig> mya. more recent estimates using nuclear data suggest a much more recent time of divergence in the range of 50– <dig> mya  <cit> . the next most closely related species with fully sequenced genomes, those of the pufferfishes takifugu rubripes and tetraodon nigroviridis are separated from sablefish by 80– <dig> mya  <cit> . as all the phylogenetic data points to the stickleback as the closest fully-sequenced genome, g. aculeatus was used in our analysis of conserved synteny.

identification of genetic markers
a set of polymorphic microsatellite and snp dna markers from our est assemblies was identified for use in genetic mapping and population studies. as the est library construction and subsequent primer design was performed prior to obtaining sablefish family tissues, the sequences do not represent either of the two families used in linkage map construction. this did not affect the use of microsatellites as the identification and amplification of polymorphic repeats proved relatively easy, with over half the  <dig> primer pairs designed successfully amplifying the desired product and yielding polymorphic repeats in one or both sablefish families. in contrast, the identification of snps from the assembled est dataset proved much less useful when targeting expected single base polymorphisms in our mapping families. however, in analyzing the adjacent sequence, mainly the 3’ utr, it was found that sablefish were indeed highly polymorphic. this led to the strategy of identifying snps through the direct sequencing of  <dig> unrelated 3’ utr gene regions of the sablefish family parents. additional primers were designed to genes of interest based on conserved sequence identified in related species. primer pair sequences, repeat motifs and other relevant information for the  <dig> newly identified microsatellites as well as the  <dig> previously published  <cit>  can be found in additional file 2: table s <dig>  for the snps, primer and annotation information can be found in additional file 3: table s <dig>  with individual snps identified in additional file 4: table s <dig> 

a preliminary set of markers was used to analyze a second, half-sibling family to determine the number of progeny from each of the three fathers. the majority of the progeny were descended from a single father  with only minor contributions from the other two fathers . it was therefore decided to analyze family  <dig> as a single full-sib family, excluding the handful of individuals descended from the other two fathers. following genetic marker identification, we began locating these markers in two sablefish families.

production of first-generation linkage map
equipped with our gene-associated markers and two sablefish families, we examined all of the markers in all the individuals from the two families to create a first-generation linkage map. in all,  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> snps were scored for all of the individuals from the two families. when it came to assembling the linkage map, the strategy of identifying multiple snps in a single sequence proved very useful. while most of the microsatellite markers were highly polymorphic and useful for mapping in both families, it was very rare that individual snps were shared between families. it was common, however, to have two or more markers from a single est assembly-derived sequence polymorphic in separate parents and families. as these markers are physically linked, separated by 600bp or less in a single contiguous sequence, we analyzed the snps as representing the locus rather than a particular marker and placed the locus on the linkage map rather than the individual nucleotide marker. this strategy was also used when multiple repeats designed from the same contig were analyzed. this allowed merging of the individual parental maps and sex-specific maps at many more sites than with the microsatellites alone, leading to a more accurate representation of marker order and distances. the  <dig> scored snps, therefore, were mapped as  <dig> snp loci; between  <dig> and  <dig> snps contributed to mapping of an individual locus.

we produced maps for each of the mapping parents, with subsequent integration into sex-specific maps and finally a merged map. the final merged map, seen in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  consists of all  <dig> snp loci and  <dig> microsatellite loci  mapped across  <dig> linkage groups. two additional microsatellite markers, afimi0079uvic and afimi0131uvic, remain unlinked and  <dig> primer pairs, while polymorphic, were uninformative in both mapping families .

the  <dig> linkage groups span  <dig>  cm in the merged map, with individual linkage groups ranging from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm . a significant difference in recombination was observed between the sexes as the male map had a length of  <dig>  cm, while the female map had a length of  <dig> cm; this gives a female:male recombination rate of  <dig> : <dig>  although the recombination rate in individual linkage groups varied greatly. this is not unusual, as higher recombination rates have been reported in the females of a number of fish species, including atlantic salmon  <cit> , catfish  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit>  and zebrafish  <cit> . in contrast, the recombination rates between the individual fathers or between the individual mothers of our mapping families were both approximately 1: <dig>  the overall length and female/male recombination ratios are likely to be underestimates however, as there are still a few gaps in the female-specific linkage map.

with only  <dig> markers remaining unlinked after mapping, we were confident that all of the chromosomes were covered by the map. this was subsequently confirmed after publication of the sablefish karyotype  <cit> ; a diploid chromosome number of 2n =  <dig> was identified, the same number as was predicted here through linkage mapping. of note, this karyotype represents the most-commonly identified karyotype in teleost fish, and is thought to represent that of the common teleost ancestor after the last whole-genome duplication  <cit> .

significant conserved synteny observed between a. fimbria and g. aculeatus
a comparison to the most closely related species for which a whole genome sequence is available was undertaken to look for syntenic chromosomes and conservation of gene order. all of the markers were derived from est assembled transcripts. these est contigs, which include markers that mapped to one of the  <dig> linkage groups, or the  <dig> singletons, were blated against the threespine stickleback genome. most  of these contig comparisons produced a significant “hit” to the stickleback genome; furthermore, as can be seen in table  <dig>  the level of conserved synteny between the two species is quite high, with a large number of markers from one sablefish linkage group producing significant “hits” to the corresponding stickleback chromosome. in most cases, the relationship between stickleback and sablefish is 1: <dig> – that is, one stickleback chromosome corresponds to a single sablefish linkage group. in three cases, there were two linkage groups for one stickleback chromosome. analyses of end-markers, however, show no hints of linkage between any of the three pairs of linkage groups. this is not surprising given the haploid chromosome number in the threespine stickleback is  <dig> while the haploid karyotype for sablefish is  <dig>  we used these relationships to assign numbers to each of our linkage groups to make comparison to stickleback easier; thus lg <dig> corresponds to stickleback chrii, and lg <dig> corresponds to stickleback chrxi. in the case of the three linkage group pairs blating to single stickleback chromosomes, the largest linkage group was assigned the stickleback chromosome number, while the smaller received the next number available above 21; resulting pairs were lg <dig> and lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> and finally lg <dig> and lg <dig> 

linkage groups showed anywhere from  <dig>  to  <dig>  hits to a single stickleback chromosome. only  <dig> of the  <dig> loci that were located to the  <dig> chromosomes in the stickleback produced significant hits to chromosomes other than that predicted for the linkage group. six of these eight markers were located  <dig> markers or less from the end of the linkage group. an additional  <dig> loci, interspersed throughout the linkage groups, hit the stickleback chrun, a “chromosome” composed of all sequence data unassigned to one of the  <dig> chromosomes. while most linkage groups had 0– <dig> loci that hit this “un” chromosome,  <dig> hits were from loci assigned to linkage group  <dig>  only one of the two un-linked microsatellite markers had a positive blat hit, mapping to chri in the threespine stickleback; this suggests that the chromosome represented by either lg <dig> or lg <dig>  the two linkage groups that are predominately associated with stickleback chri, is likely larger than predicted by the current sablefish linkage map.

gene order also appears relatively well conserved between sablefish and the threespine stickleback, as shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  in most cases, 1– <dig> inversions can be used to explain the difference in marker ordering between the two species, with markers located between inversion points consistently ordered. this is important and will be revisited later, as it allows for prediction of candidate genes of interest in the sablefish based on the annotated whole-genome sequence in stickleback. development of the sablefish linkage map and the identification of conserved synteny may present an opportunity to re-evaluate the stickleback genome assembly and successfully locate some of the loci previously pooled into chr un.

additional markers by genotyping-by-sequencing 
the construction of a gbs library was performed to create a second-generation linkage map to supplement our microsatellite/snp sablefish map and to identify potential sex-specific sequences. two illumina lanes of gbs sequencing were produced to test this technique for sablefish linkage mapping and to determine whether the apeki restriction enzyme used was appropriate for sablefish; most of the individuals were from our second mapping family, with a few additional, unrelated and sexed individuals used to aid in sex identification . we obtained ~ <dig> million barcoded reads, with between  <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> unique reads per individual. we determined there was an average of 8– <dig> fold read coverage per unique genomic sequence, well below the desired 60x for a de novo sequencing study  <cit> . while overall coverage was less than desired, we were still able to utilize the data to identify additional snp markers. with relatively conservative parameters, a total of  <dig> polymorphic loci were identified through next-generation sequencing; see additional file 6: table s <dig> for details.

genetic identification of sex in sablefish
in sablefish, as in other fish species, one of the most economically and biologically important and perplexing phenotypes is sex. sexual dimorphism in fish is often observed with one sex, commonly the female in sablefish, growing both faster and larger than the other sex. rapid and substantial growth is a desirable trait particularly in aquaculture and ocean ranching. thus, selection for females early in rearing, or the production of monosex female offspring is of great interest to these industries. while external identification of sex is difficult and inaccurate in immature sablefish, internal analysis of the gonads can usually determine the sex of the fish but sacrificing the fish is required. at  <dig> months, the sex of each of our fish was easily identified by the size of the gonads themselves, with the ovaries well over twice the size of the testis in males and females of equal size and weight. assuming a single locus phenotype, we attempted to place sex on each of the sex-specific maps. while unsuccessful in linking sex to the female map, we were successfully able to map the trait to linkage group  <dig> of the male map, suggesting an xx-xy sex determination system. as previously described in the comparative mapping section, this corresponds to chromosome xiv of the stickleback genome. adjacent markers further narrowed this region to between  <dig>  and  <dig> mb on the stickleback genome. this region does not correspond to the y-specific region of the threespine stickleback linked to chr xix  <cit>  nor to the y-chromosome associated with lg <dig>  of the ninespine stickleback pungitius pungitius <cit> . during review, a report was published on the expression of five genes of interest in sex, including three shown to be significantly elevated in juvenile testes  <cit> . two of these three are located on the linkage map, dmrt <dig> mapping to lg <dig> and sox9a to lg <dig>  both predicted by comparative mapping to the threespine stickleback genome. neither the remaining testis-elevated gene, amh, nor the two genes found with elevated expression in the ovaries, foxl <dig> and cyp19a1a were predicted to be found on lg14; amh is predicted to be located on lg <dig>  foxl <dig> on lg <dig> and cyp19a1a on lg <dig> 

examination of the sablefish gbs library was undertaken to determine whether we could identify any sex-specific sequences. the sequences were processed using the program jellyfish  <cit>  into kmers with length  <dig> and each kmer was counted in each individual, and placed into a matrix. we searched for unique kmers found only in male or female fish, with a minor allowance for sequencing errors . after assembling sex-specific kmers into overlapping mini-contigs, we were able to identify  <dig> mini-contigs of interest, which were then mapped back to the original  <dig> bp paired-end reads. these reads were blated against the stickleback genome, and two of these reads produced hits > <dig> , both of which blated against the region where we expected to find sex in chrxiv of stickleback. these sites have been designated tag <dig> and tag <dig> based on the order that they were identified. genome walking was performed in order to provide enough sequence to design primers to score the polymorphic markers in our sex-specific tags, and this process recovered well over  <dig> bp surrounding each tag for primer design. following amplification with the new primers on  <dig> unrelated, definitively sexed sablefish, the alleles identified by tag  <dig> and tag <dig> were present in every male and absent in all females.

both tags blat to the region between the genes ppef <dig> and aff <dig> on the stickleback genome. in this region, and in particular between these two tags, two coding regions were predicted to be found based on stickleback ests. based on tblastx, the first coding region  was an aff <dig> homolog. the second gene region  was most likely gonadal soma-derived factor . primers were designed to amplify the region between our tags and a short region of gsdf available in our sablefish rnaseq assembly. amplification of the long pcr products that stretched between tag <dig> and gsdf revealed a male specific fragment that was ~  <dig> bp larger than the pcr products obtained from female samples. no differences between male and female samples were observed between the coding region of gsdf and tag  <dig> .

primers were designed to span the region between tag  <dig> and gsdf in order to identify the male-specific sequences. sequencing the resulting amplified products yielded a number of interesting features in the sequence upstream and within the gsdf gene . two regions of ~ <dig> bp and ~ <dig> bp are each present in duplicate  in the sequence 5’ of the gene, while a number of smaller repeats are found throughout the sequence. a number of snps in the upstream and intronic portions of gsdf appeared to be linked to sex and there were two exonic polymorphisms, one of which caused a sex-specific coding change from a phenylalanine in the x-chromosomal copy to a leucine in the y. most surprising though was the presence not only of a y-specific sequence of  <dig> bp, but an x-specific sequence of  <dig> bp that produced the observed  <dig> bp difference in amplified size. primers were designed to confirm x and y specificity of the sequences. a pcr reaction was designed to amplify across the x-specific sequence, with primers designed just outside of the specific sequence to produce amplified bands from both chromosomes; as seen in figure 5b, amplification in both sexes show the larger band corresponding to the x-chromosome, while only amplification in the males produced the small band from the y-chromosome demonstrating the lack of x-specific sequence. amplification of the y-specific sequence was more difficult due to the insertion falling in the middle of a repeated sequence; a nested pcr was therefore performed targeting only the male-specific sequence. as shown in figure 5c, the nested primers produced bands only in the males, not in the females. in the  <dig> unrelated, definitively sexed sablefish analyzed, all tested females carried two copies of the x-specific insertion, while males carried one chromosome with the x-specific insertion and one with the y-specific, adding further evidence to the male being the heterogametic sex. both sequences are flanked by inverted repeats of  <dig>  to  <dig>  base pairs, suggesting the original insertion may have involved a transposase, although no transposase could be identified in the inserted sequences. representative sequences for the x and y insertions were uploaded to the ncbi nucleotide database as genbank:kc <dig> and genbank:kc <dig> respectively; masked sequences with all described elements can be found in additional file 7: figure s <dig> 

portions of the x-specific sequence were identified elsewhere in the sablefish tsa library, but with no strong hits to the adjacent gsdf promoter sequences it is likely that the  <dig> bp sequence is a repeat sequence or transposable element. significant blast hits for this element to non-sablefish sequences were to est and wgs sequences of atlantic cod, gadus morhua, . the y-specific insertion also only produced significant blast hits to g. morhua sequences, although the y-specific insertion was not observed in the expressed sablefish sequences. even though sablefish is commonly called alaskan black cod, it is not a true cod and is only distantly related to the gadiformes . while the mechanism for the observed sequence similarity between this element in the two species remains unknown, others have proposed that parasites such as the trematodes schistosoma japonicum and diplostomum spp.  <cit> , or the sea lamprey petromyzon marinus <cit>  may facilitate lateral transposition of transposable elements and other sequences between unrelated host fish species; atlantic cod and sablefish are geographically separated but the range of the pacific cod gadus macrocephalus and sablefish overlap significantly allowing for the possibility of some form of lateral transfer between species.

the presence of the major sex-specific insertions in sablefish immediately upstream of the gsdf gene is quite intriguing. as a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, the gsdf gene was first described in the proliferation of primordial germ cell and spermatogonial proliferation in rainbow trout  <cit> . it has since been shown that in the evolutionarily conserved cluster of genes that includes gsdf, it is the only gene preferentially expressed in teleostean testis  <cit> . further, it has been shown that expression of gsdf in the zebrafish occurs prior to gonad differentiation in the early development of zebrafish, and is expressed solely in the gonads  <cit> . the gene was described as a master-sex determinant in a medaka species, oryzias luzonensis <cit> . while we do not present enough evidence to describe gsdf as the master-sex determinant in sablefish, the location of the sex-specific insertions  in the promoter region immediately upstream of a gene that has been described as a master sex determinant in another fish species, and coupled with its placement in a cluster of genes otherwise expressed preferentially in ovaries suggests that gsdf is the strongest candidate for the master-sex determinant in sablefish. furthermore, if future research supports gsdf as the master-sex determinant in sablefish, it will represent the first description of the independent evolution of the same gene to the role of master-sex determinant in different orders of fish. independent evolution of dmrt as a sex-determinant has been described in african clawed frogs  <cit>  and chickens  <cit> , but in fish, this gene has been described as the main sex-determinant only in closely related medaka species.

from oryzias luzonensis, it is estimated that sex-specific expression differences in gsdf are first observed around hatching , and are no longer detected at  <dig> days after hatching  <cit> . if the same timing was observed in sablefish, significant male over-expression should be observed between around  <dig>  d.p.f   <cit>  and will no longer be significant  <dig> days post-hatching . as shown in figure 5d, gsdf is overexpressed in males around hatching, although unlike our predictions, it remains overexpressed relative to the females up to  <dig> d.p.h.; products are not visible following  <dig> cycles in either sex five days prior to hatching. in  <dig> month sablefish, no difference is observed in the expression of gsdf in ovaries and testis . it is therefore possible that differential expression may contribute to the development of each sex, although it remains to be determined what role the amino acid substitution from phenylalanine to leucine may have on the actions of the protein.

significance of the genomic tools
genomic tools can be applied to many questions relating to fisheries, aquaculture, aquatic physiology, ecology, evolution, disease, resistance, reproduction, growth, response to the environment, general immunity and general biology of sablefish. the resources developed here will be fundamental in the management and analysis of wild and domestic commercial stocks. at a landed value of us $ <dig> /lb, the sablefish is the second most valuable finfish per pound  and represents the fourth greatest total value  to  <dig> pacific canadian and american commercial fisheries  <cit> . the large set of microsatellite and snp markers as well as the sequences provided by the complete mitochondrial genome, will allow for a robust molecular analysis of sablefish structure throughout the natural range to determine the most appropriate population management. additionally, the ease of genetically sexing both immature and mature sablefish will allow for the easy addition of sex as an additional parameter in analyses of population composition and movement. the availability of expressed sequences should allow a genetic base to design studies to gain insight into the physiology and biology of these deep-sea organisms.

many of these markers can likely be used in analysis of closely related species such as skilfish   <cit>  and perhaps other scorpaeniformes, gasterosteiformes and perciformes species. the degree of conserved synteny between the threespine stickleback and the sablefish suggests that these tools may be very useful in many species including other economically important species such as lingcod and greenling  or the more distantly related rockfish .

the use of these resources will also be helpful in the development of species for aquaculture as well as for conservation and management of wild stocks. a linkage map and the demonstrated ability to use the threespine stickleback genome to determine likely gene location will facilitate molecular analysis and development of markers for selective breeding. the expressed transcript library will provide access to particular genes of interest and the development of sex markers will allow for the study of sex-specific phenotypes. if gsdf is confirmed as the master sex determinant in sablefish, the targeted production of monosex or sterile stocks for use in aquaculture may be possible.

CONCLUSIONS
with this work, we present the largest collection of genetic data available for sablefish. a mitochondrial genome sequence was produced and used to place sablefish among scorpaeniformes and gasterosteiformes fishes. we have sequenced and assembled transcript library of nearly  <dig>  sequences for the sablefish, and identified microsatellite and snp markers for use in broodstock selection and population management. using our polymorphic markers, we have produced a linkage map consisting of  <dig> linkage groups, which is in agreement with the expected number of chromosomes previously identified through karyotyping. comparative mapping has been used with g. aculeatus to show significant conservation of gene order, allowing for the stickleback genome to be used to predict gene location in sablefish. a genotyping-by-sequencing library was used to identify additional snps, adding  <dig> markers, and to identify sex-specific markers. finally, the sex-specific markers led directly to the identification of sex-specific sequences in the sablefish, located in the upstream promoter region of the known sex pathway gene, gonadal soma-derived factor, the master sex determinant in the medaka, oryzias luzonensis.
