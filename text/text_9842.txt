BACKGROUND
skeletal mineralization relies on a tightly regulated connection between cell activity and extracellular environment. researchers in skeletal biology analyse the cellular and molecular events underlying skeletal matrix formation and maintenance, and the mechanisms that promote and limit the mineralization of the matrix. therefore, standardized methodologies and tools are a prerequisite to assess and quantify extracellular matrix mineralization in the context of bone and cartilage development, skeletal growth, remodelling and regeneration  <cit> .

teleost fish, such as zebrafish , are recognized models to study skeletal development and regeneration  <cit> . the development of the skeleton can be observed at very early stages since embryonic/larval zebrafish remain translucent during the first important steps of skeletal development  <cit> . in addition, the complete genome sequence and its annotation are available, as well as a broad array of molecular and cellular tools. an increasing number of well characterized fish mutants has been derived from large scale mutagenesis screens , and many transgenic fish lines have been developed using fluorescent proteins  to report the expression of skeleton-related genes  <cit> . recently, the development of reverse genetic approaches, such as tale nucleases and crispr/cas <dig> systems, opened new horizons for targeted mutagenesis in zebrafish  <cit> . overall, these advantages make zebrafish a valuable vertebrate model system, widely used in fundamental and applied research .

the study of mineralized structures in teleost fish is traditionally based on the analysis of fixed samples . for live imaging, bone development can be tracked with radiographs in large specimens  <cit> , but for small sized species, such as zebrafish, the use of radiographic and μct approaches to visualize the skeleton is restricted due to resolution constraints  <cit> . thus, there is a need for reliable and non-toxic in vivo imaging techniques to allow continuous monitoring of skeletal development in living individual zebrafish.

fluorescent calcium dyes  can label calcium-containing tissues and be used to follow skeletal mineralization in vivo. sclerochronology, in the frame of fish stock assessment, is a common application for calcium dyes . for zebrafish, only the use of calcein has been optimized for in vivo staining  <cit>  but most transgenic zebrafish lines use gfp as a reporter  <cit> , which emits fluorescence within the same spectrum as calcein. in addition, the fluorescence spectrum of calcein is similar to that obtained with fish tissue autofluorescence  <cit> . thus, alternatives to calcein for zebrafish skeletal staining are desirable.

alizarin , which emits a red signal under fluorescent green light, has been used for in vivo labelling for many decades  <cit> . vital staining of fish bone is accomplished with two alizarin variants, alizarin red s  and alizarin complexone . in a study on japanese flounder paralichthys olivaceus  <cit>  similar concentrations of alc and ars  were shown to provide equally strong staining by fish immersion in the staining solution. several studies performed on zebrafish and medaka also show the applicability of in vivo alizarin skeletal staining . yet, published protocols suffer from two shortcomings. first, a consistent protocol concerning alizarin concentration, time of immersion and washing steps has not been established. second, possible negative effects of alizarin on bone growth and mineralization have not been assessed. since alizarin has been described to inhibit growth and mineralization in vivo in rats, rabbits and guinea-pigs  <cit> , a careful validation of alizarin live staining protocols is required.

the results of this study show that ars, used according to the protocol defined in the present work, is a reliable tool for in vivo staining and detailed analysis of mineralized skeletal structures in developing and in adult zebrafish. a detailed quantitative analysis of growth and mineral apposition rates revealed that a low concentration of ars, combined with short immersion intervals, has no negative effect on bone development. a standardized staining protocol is suggested and its applicability is demonstrated on the developing skeleton of zebrafish and on regenerating caudal fin rays  in adult zebrafish.table  <dig> overview of studies using in vivo staining with alizarin compounds  by immersion for in vivo skeletal analysis or paraformaldehyde fixed teleost specimens. species names, dye concentrations, duration of immersion, wash steps, and literature references are indicated

RESULTS
alizarin red s in vivo staining - exploring optimal concentrations
proper staining of skeletal elements in fish by immersion in fluorochrome solutions demands a compromise between concentration, immersion period, survival and rearing conditions  <cit> . currently, most protocols used for vital staining of bone rely on alizarin compounds. however, the published protocols vary concerning dye concentration and time of immersion . despite the potential that alc may have, this study focused on testing a single compound, ars, to simplify the analysis. we also aimed at developing a protocol with short immersion periods, in contrast to existing protocols, in which immersion takes up to 24 h  <cit> . here, a daily, single immersion period of 15 min is proposed both for larvae  and adult zebrafish. calcein, another standard reagent for in vivo skeletal staining of zebrafish  <cit> , was used as a control staining, following an established calcein staining protocol  <cit> . it should, however, be noted that ars concentrations used here were much lower  than those used for calcein .fig.  <dig> quantification of mineral apposition in developing zebrafish larvae. schematic representation of the quantification of the mineral apposition rates in vertebral centra following ars or calcein staining. a mineral apposition was determined  by monitoring the mineralized surface areas  of the three least mineralized vertebral centra  in the beginning of the experiment. b centra sa’s were calculated based on width  and height , as indicated



using the same imaging settings ,  <dig>  % ars yielded a strong mineral staining , but at 5× lower concentrations,  <dig>  % ars, lighter but still adequate detection of all mineralized structures were observed . in contrast,  <dig>  % ars yielded only a sparse and incomplete detection of mineralized structures, with evident false negative staining . accordingly, a 15 min exposure to  <dig>  % ars is inappropriate for the labelling and subsequent correct detection of mineralized structures. the highest tested ars concentration , although providing strong staining, caused significant stress to fish, particularly in adults, noted by direct observation of increased operculum movements  <cit> .fig.  <dig> determination of the proper ars concentration for vital staining. imaging of  <dig> dpf stained larvae with the same settings showed that   <dig>  % ars 15 min immersion yielded stronger staining than   <dig>  % ars, but the later provided the best signal to noise ratio, with minimum stress levels. c  <dig>  % ars was considered the lowest concentration providing signal detection, since most structures were weakly stained. d  <dig>  % calcein staining was used as a reference staining. e graphical representation of mineral apposition rates  at  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h after first staining, when exposed to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % ars and  <dig>  % calcein. bars represent standard deviation. means were statistically different , by multiple comparison of means using one-way anova and tukey’s post test, between larvae stained with calcein and those stained with  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  ars at  <dig> hps. on the second axis of the graph, growth  is indicated: control conditions ; following staining with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % ars, and  <dig>  % calcein . scale bars = 1 mm



we also observed that calcein , under the established concentration  <cit> , displayed a higher background staining when observed with epifluorescence compared to all ars concentrations. to eliminate the background staining, calcein stained specimens required additional, time consuming, rinsing steps.

next, we tested if different concentrations of ars and calcein affected mineral apposition and animal growth . we did not observe significant differences in growth rate either among ars treated larvae, or when comparing ars-treated, calcein-treated and control groups . this shows that none of the staining protocols has a detectable effect on growth. for mineral apposition rates, differences between fish stained with calcein and ars were registered at 24 h after first exposure. developing vertebral centra exposed to  <dig>  % calcein showed approximately 82 % of the mineral apposition rate registered with ars, corresponding to a decrease of  <dig>  % detected mineral when compared with  <dig>  % ars ,  <dig>  % when compared with  <dig>  % ars , and  <dig>  % when compared with  <dig>  % ars. as there was no significant effect on growth rate, only the detected mineralization was affected by calcein.

at  <dig> and 72 h after first exposure, no significant differences were observed on mineral apposition rates between the three ars protocols, showing that fish exposed to these concentrations of ars did not suffer from inhibition of growth or mineral apposition rates, when compared with control and calcein stained fish.

this study shows that mineralization is not significantly affected when fish are treated daily for 15 min with low concentrations of ars , even if the treatment is repeated over several consecutive days. we propose the use of  <dig>  % ars as vital stain for bone during early and late skeletal development. this low ars concentration provides clear staining of bone with no apparent induction of stress. the data on calcein staining suggest a mineralization inhibition at 24 h after first exposure, possibly due to the high concentration of the staining solution when compared with the tested ars solutions. furthermore, the green fluorescent signal from calcein and gfp reporter lines, which emit at a similar wavelength, are indistinguishable, reinforcing the value of ars staining as an alternative to calcein.

ars staining of regenerating caudal fin lepidotrichia
one of the main topics of current caudal fin regeneration research is the differentiation of scleroblasts, the cells responsible for the formation of the mineralized matrix of the lepidotrichia . in one published study, ars was used together with gfp reporter lines, at a concentration of  <dig>  % and an incubation time of 10 min  <cit> . in our study we also tested  <dig>  % ars staining, which was found to provide sufficient detection of mineral in the regenerating fin rays as early as 48 h post-amputation .fig.  <dig> sequence of lepidotrichia regeneration events in the zebrafish caudal fin. caudal fin of fish stained with  <dig>  % ars at a  <dig>  b  <dig>  c  <dig> and d  <dig> hpa. b’ detail of a fin ray at  <dig> hpa, already displaying de novo mineralized tissue. amputation axis is indicated . scale bar  = 2 mm;  =  <dig>  mm



ars detection sensitivity in fixed specimens
alizarin compound staining procedures are commonly analysed using transmitted light source within the visible spectrum. in addition, it is also possible to take advantage of the fluorescent property of ars. in published protocols, vitally stained specimens are fixed and subsequently analysed . a more recent study  <cit>  analyses ars signals with fluorescent light in zebrafish that are stained after fixation. the authors describe as advantages of alizarin fluorescence the detailed assessment of mineralized structures without the need for advanced maceration of soft tissues. however, the staining solution used in this study was  <dig>  % ars dissolved in a  <dig>  % koh solution, which inevitably macerates the tissues due to its extreme high ph. we therefore tested on fixed samples the use of  <dig>  % ars concentration in a combination of short  immersion period with a staining solution without koh addition. for this experiment, ars was dissolved in an alcoholic solution  <cit> . this procedure offers a major advantage, particularly when combined with immunofluorescence , since ars staining without maceration of soft tissuesprovides a reliable co-localization of specific proteins and mineralized matrix. in addition, ars staining tracked under fluorescence allows a detailed identification of early mineralization events, with a good signal/noise ratio. fish larvae stained with this protocol can even be subjected to further histological analysis of tissues and cells  <cit> . we can also observe the formation of vertebral centra anlagen within the notochord sheath that are difficult to observe with visible light , as well as structures of the head skeleton in larger specimens . with visible light, these bones are neither visible nor distinguishable from the background. in addition, ars detected under fluorescence, proved to be suitable for the detailed observation of skeletal microstructures, such as vertebral body endplate growth rings . the repeated analysis of zebrafish early vertebral body mineralization in early developmental stages  <cit>  revealed that, the exposure of specimens to koh solutions, causes maceration of the mineralized matrices, such as the notochord sheath. since the anlagen of the teleost vertebral centra form in the notochord sheath  <cit> , removal of the matrix through maceration is likely the cause for false negative ars staining. so far, false negative ars staining has only been recognized in connection to acid pre-treatment of fish larvae, in the course of double staining for cartilage and bone  <cit> .fig.  <dig> ars staining of fixed zebrafish samples. panels a-b show a vertebral column of a  <dig> dpf larva stained with  <dig>  % ars in 70 % ethanol. a bright field observation provides less detail of the early mineralization deposits than b fluorescence observation . panels c-d show cranial structures of a juvenile  stained with  <dig>  % ars and observed under c bright field and d fluorescent light, evidencing the higher power of detection of, e.g., the operculum  under fluorescent conditions. scale bars  =  <dig>  mm;  =  <dig>  mm

combination of ars in vivo staining with gfp reporter lines, and a tool to reveal skeletal malformations
here we tested the use of the proposed ars staining protocol combined with a gfp reporter transgenic line. the direct observation of early mineralizing structures was shown to be possible in tg transgenic fish, which contain a reporter for the vascular system . the dual visualization of mineralization and gfp expression can be relevant for the documentation of bone pathologies. indeed, skeletal malformations in fish are a subject of growing interest, related to malformations in farmed fish and to skeletal defects of model fish in the frame of biomedical research  <cit> . the example of malformed regenerated lepidotrichia shows that deformities can be observed in great detail using ars staining . further examples are the visualisation of lordosis  and kyphosis  in the vertebral column of juvenile zebrafish . the ars in vivo staining permits the evaluation of live fish and the continuous tracking of malformations.fig  <dig> detection of skeletal malformations in zebrafish. deformed bony structures in a caudal fin rays and b-c different regions of the vertebral column. all regions display affected structures with different degrees of severity. white arrowheads show sites of malformation. scale bars  = 2 mm;  =  <dig>  mm



CONCLUSIONS
even though ars has been used in the past as a fluorescent mineralization label  <cit> , no consistent in vivo staining protocol has been proposed for small teleosts such as medaka or zebrafish. here, such a protocol is proposed . our results show that, when applied in low concentrations  in combination with short-term immersion , ars does not inhibit mineralization in developing zebrafish or in adult fish during fin ray regeneration. the quantification of mineralization allowed assessing the effect of repetitive staining on the progress of mineralization during development. it is shown here that the proposed ars staining protocol can be safely used for repetitive staining procedures. it is also shown that ars in vivo staining can be combined with detection of gfp reporter expression in transgenic lines and allows a detailed analysis of skeletal development and malformations. for staining of fixed specimens, we show that not only acid pre-treatment but also maceration with strong alkaline solutions can cause false negative staining of early mineralization. as an alternative to calcein staining, a standardized use of the proposed ars staining protocol can provide detailed insights into skeletal development of small model organisms such as zebrafish and medaka.table  <dig> bench protocol. steps of the proposed ars in vivo staining protocol
