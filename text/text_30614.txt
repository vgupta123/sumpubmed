BACKGROUND
post-transcriptional control of gene expression is critical for the proper control of inflammation  <cit> . microrna  mediated transcript degradation and translational inhibition represent two important mechanisms of post-transcriptional control, and a large body of work demonstrates the complex role mirnas play in fine-tuning the regulatory networks that govern inflammation and innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . allergic airway diseases  such as allergic rhinitis and asthma are characterized by aberrant adaptive immune responses to allergens that results in airway inflammation, mucus hyper-secretion, and airway hyper-responsiveness  <cit> . evidence is accruing that mirnas play a role in these diseases . in particular, several mirnas have been shown to regulate pathways underlying aad pathogenesis including t-lymphocyte polarization and function , regulatory t-cell activity  <cit> , and airway smooth muscle proliferation and contractility . previous studies have also identified mirnas that are differentially expressed in airway epithelia of individuals with aad  and in mouse models of aad  <cit> . however, the question of whether genetic variation in mirna expression affects aad phenotypes has not been addressed.

we previously characterized the genetics of lung mrna expression in a mouse model of aad  <cit>  using the collaborative cross  mouse genetics reference population. the cc is a mammalian systems genetics resource comprised of recombinant inbred lines derived from eight-way crosses using five classical inbred strains  and three wild-derived inbred strains   <cit> . using incipient  cc lines, which we refer to as “pre-cc” mice, we identified more than  <dig>  gene expression quantitative trait loci , the majority of which were located near the cognate gene. we used these eqtl to identify candidate genes within qtl for inflammation phenotypes  <cit> . for example, we identified a locus on chromosome  <dig> that controls the expression of a gene that is causally related to neutrophil recruitment  <cit> , thereby linking sequence variation, gene expression, and a downstream phenotype. those analyses were limited to mrnas. thus, the role of mirnas in this experimental system remains unknown.

to identify mirnas that play a role in aad, we leveraged the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of precc mice and utilized two complementary analytical approaches. in the first approach we assessed whether regulatory variation at mirna loci underlies variation in allergic inflammation. we identified robustly expressed mirnas that vary by strain, mapped the genetic loci that correlate with expression levels, and then determined whether these loci are associated with aad phenotypes. in the second approach, we combined bioinformatic sequence analysis with statistical simulations to identify mirnas that serve as candidate master regulators of genes altered during airway inflammation.

methods
our overall study design and workflow is depicted in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

mice
we obtained  <dig> male precc mice  from oak ridge national laboratory  <cit> . each mouse was from an independent cc line that had undergone five to fourteen generations of inbreeding. we also obtained four male mice of each of the eight cc founder strains from the jackson laboratory. all mice were singly housed, with alpha-dri bedding, under normal 12-h light/dark cycles. all experiments conducted with mice in this study were compliant with an institutional animal care and use committee protocol at an animal facility approved accrediated by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international.

phenotyping protocol
we employed a house dust mite  model of  aad that produces hallmark disease phenotypes including th2-biased airway inflammation, elevated serum ige, mucous cell metaplasia, and airway hyper-responsiveness in a strain-dependent fashion  <cit> . mice were sensitized with 10 μg of the immunodominant allergen from the dermatophagoides pteronyssinus species of hdm, der p  <dig>  by intra-peritoneal injection on days  <dig> and  <dig>  followed by challenge with 50 μg of der p  <dig>  administered by oro-pharyngeal aspiration, on day  <dig>  on day  <dig>  mice were euthanized, followed by collection of whole lung lavage fluid with two successive volumes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ml pbs. no perfusion was performed, so vascular contents were still present in the lungs. following lavage, lung tissue was snap frozen. cells in lavage fluid were isolated by centrifugation; eosinophil and neutrophil counts were then manually determined using cytospins and morphologic criteria.

mirna expression analysis
for the eight cc founder strains , we isolated total lung rna by trizol extraction. rna quality was assessed using an agilent bioanalyzer. with one exception, all samples had rna integrity numbers greater than  <dig>  rna samples were then processed and hybridized to affymetrix mirna  <dig>  arrays . we limited our analysis to the  <dig> probe sets on the array that are specific to mouse mirnas. manual inspection of results from principle component analysis of mirna expression revealed that two samples were outliers ; these two samples were removed prior to subsequent analyses. we used an anova model to identify mirnas that were differentially expressed by strain at a false discovery rate  q-value <  <dig> . we further filtered this list of mirnas to those that were highly expressed, which we defined as within the top 20th percentile of mirna expression in any one cc founder strain, and those that varied by at least  <dig> -fold between the highest and lowest-expressing strains. this limited the list to  <dig> mirnas. we also selected one mirna, mir-17* , as a reference mirna for normalization in experiments with precc mice. mir-17* was selected because its expression was near the mean of all mirnas that met our selection criteria  and it was not differentially expressed by strain .

from these anova models described above, we estimated broad-sense heritability  by calculating the interclass correlation  and the coefficient of genetic determination   <cit> : r1=msb‐msw/msb+n‐1msw where msb and msw are the mean squares between and within, respectively, from the eight-way anova model described above and n is the number of mice per strain. g <dig> is a slightly modified estimate of heritability that accounts for the doubling of the additive genetic variance with inbreeding and is calculated as: g2=msb‐msw/msb+2n‐1msw 

for the precc mice, the same rna isolation protocol was used. we then used exiqon locked nucleic acid -based qrt-pcr assays for each of the  <dig> mirnas, except mir- <dig> . we added mir-148b and mir- <dig> due to published evidence indicating roles in asthma or allergic inflammation in the lung  <cit> , and mir-17* and u <dig> for normalization. thus in total we measured the expression of  <dig> mirnas and one snrna . since the time of ordering the exiqon lna qrt-pcr assays, three of the measured mirnas have had name changes: mir-17* is now mir-17-3p; mir-193* is now mir-193-5p; and mir-322* is now mir-322-3p. we maintained the old nomenclature throughout the manuscript since that is consistent with exiqon product information at the time of ordering. exiqon mircury lna universal rt was used to generate cdna, after which mirna-specific primers were used to amplify each mirna. for each mirna for each mouse, we calculated the delta ct relative to mir-17*. across all samples and mirnas, the delta ct relative to mir-17* and u <dig> snrna  were highly correlated . qpcr data is provided as additional file  <dig> 

eqtl approach
genotyping and eqtl mapping
we genotyped each mouse at the university of north carolina at chapel hill, using one of two affymetrix snp arrays  that were produced during the development of the mouse diversity array   <cit> . after removing uninformative and poorly performing snps, these arrays contained  <dig>   and  <dig>   snp assays, and the set of snps on each array did not overlap. most mice  were genotyped on the b-array and the remaining were genotyped on the a-array. these training arrays were annotated to ncbi build  <dig> of the mouse genome, but we mapped qtl boundaries to build  <dig> positions to integrate with other resources. we report ncbi build  <dig> positions in our results. we estimated the most probable ancestor for each snp in each mouse using the gain algorithm  <cit> , and reconstructed founder haplotypes based on these results. we then merged the non-overlapping snp datasets from arrays a and b by imputing unobserved genotypes based on inferred founder haplotype. for qtl mapping, we used happy  <cit>  to infer ancestry matrices for an additive genetic model. for computational efficiency, we then averaged the matrices across snps between which gain inferred no recombination in the population, and this reduced the mapping dataset to  <dig>  intervals. genotype data are provided as additional file  <dig>  we used bagpipe  <cit>  to fit a regression model and calculate lod scores. significance thresholds were determined by permutation , and we used the  <dig>  lod drop method to approximate confidence intervals for qtl  <cit> . we defined local eqtl as eqtl located within 10 mb of the cognate gene based on prior work on mrna eqtl  <cit> . narrow sense heritability  for eqtl was estimated by regression of mirna expression on cc founder haplotype probabilities. for example, the expression of a given mirna y is y=intercept+b1c57bl/6j+b2129s1/svimj+b3nod/shiltj+b4nzo/h1ltj+b5pwk/phj+b6cast/eij+b7wsb/eij+error where each strain term represents the estimated number of that strain’s haplotypes present at the qtl for a given mouse , and where a/j is designated as the reference strain. we used the model r <dig> to describe the percent of phenotypic variation accounted for by the locus.

identification of regions of shared ancestry and phylogenetic analysis
we used a comparative genomic approach to narrow qtl regions and identify candidate genes, as described previously  <cit> . using the allele effect plots as a guide, we grouped founder alleles into two groups by effect . we divided the two groups based on the greatest difference between ordered allele effects estimated at the qtl peak. we then used the collaborative cross viewer at the university of north carolina  <cit>  and genome sequences from the wellcome trust sanger mouse genomes project   <cit>  to identify regions in the confidence interval in which grouped strains have shared snp genotypes. positions identified as heterozygous and low confidence genotype calls were omitted from the analysis.

analysis of the effects of snps on pre-mirna structure
to examine the consequences of snps on mirna structure, we used two computational approaches. first, we used rnafold  <cit>  to compare the predicted structures of pre-mir- <dig> based on the reference allele  to a musculus-derived allele  containing two snps  and one indel  that fall within the precursor. second, we used snpfold  <cit>  to formally test whether either snp affects the ensemble of predicted rna structures.

bioinformatic/statistical approach to identify putative mirna-mrna regulatory networks
to construct putative mirna-mrna regulatory networks, we utilized a multistep procedure outlined in green in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we first identified mrna transcripts linearly  correlated at an fdr <  <dig>  with log-transformed eosinophil or neutrophil counts that were previously quantified  <cit> . we refer to these as called quantitative trait transcripts  <cit> . second, we identified quantitative trait mirnas, which we defined as mirnas that were linearly correlated with inflammation phenotypes at an fdr <  <dig> . for each phenotype , we paired positive quantitative trait transcripts with negative quantitative trait mirnas and vice-versa. we then used a monte carlo simulation strategy called mirhub  <cit>  to identify the mirnas that may act as regulatory hubs for a given set of oppositely correlated quantitative trait transcripts. mirhub identifies mirnas that are predicted to regulate a target gene list/network more than expected by chance. to accomplish this the algorithm utilizes the following inputs:  the strength and clustering of mirna target sites in the gene set , these predicted interactions can be filtered to require a minimum level of conservation across species - we specified conservation between mouse and one other species ;  the centrality of target genes in a network, which is based on high confidence protein-protein interactions listed in the string  <dig>  database  - we did not employ this feature; and  the expected range of targeting scores in random gene lists/networks . empirical p-values are generated based on the comparison of the observed distribution of target scores to the distribution found in the random gene networks, and are adjusted for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate.

RESULTS
as outlined in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we used two complementary approaches to identify mirnas that may be associated with aad, one based explicitly on genetically determined variation in mirna expression , and one that does not rely on genetic diversity per se but rather combined bioinformatics and statistical analyses to construct putative mirna-mrna regulatory networks . we begin with results from our survey of mirna expression in cc founder strains, followed results from the eqtl and bioinformatics/statistical approaches, respectively.

detection of differentially expressed mirnas in the lungs of cc founder strains
we measured the expression of  <dig> mirnas in whole lung rna samples from the eight cc founder strains  using microarrays . we identified  <dig> that were differentially expressed by strain at an fdr <  <dig>  ,  <dig> of which were identified as highly expressed in at least one strain . hierarchical clustering of these  <dig> mirnas clearly demonstrated the effect of strain  and the sample clustering was consistent with the known phylogenetic relationships among these strains  <cit> . we estimated the broad sense heritability  for mirna expression ; h <dig> values ranged from  <dig>  for mir-200a to  <dig>  for mir-342-3p.fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering mirna expression among cc founder lines. of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas detected using a microarray platform,  <dig> were selected based on the expression values and these are depicted here. note that with one exception , the overall sample clustering is consistent with the phylogenetic relationships among these strains



to ensure that these results were not false positives due to altered hybridization between array probes and genetic variants, we mapped probesets of differentially expressed mirnas to genetic variants contained in the sanger mouse genomes project data  <cit> . three probesets aligned to regions that contain structural variants among cc founder strains , but the observed patterns of expression were not correlated with the strain distribution of structural variants. thus we conclude that the variation in mirna expression is not biased by the array platform we used.

eqtl approach
we then measured the expression of  <dig> out of  <dig> of these mirnas , as well as mir-148b and mir- <dig> due to published evidence indicating roles for these mirnas in asthma or allergic inflammation in the lung  <cit> , in  <dig> precc lines using exiqon lna-based qrt-pcr assays. we observed a broad range of expression for many mirnas . we note in particular the bimodal distributions for two mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  suggesting a single, large-effect eqtl for each.

next we performed genome-wide scans for each mirna to identify mirna eqtl. in total, we identified  <dig> high-confidence eqtl  corresponding to  <dig> different mirnas, and an additional eight potential eqtl  for seven more mirnas . this equates to high-confidence eqtl for  <dig> % of the mirnas that were differentially and highly expressed among the founder strains , though surprisingly mir- <dig> was not one of them. of the high-confidence eqtl, nine were located near the mirna gene itself , which we refer to as local eqtl  <cit> , while nine were located distal to the mirna gene, including on other chromosomes. these results differ from our previous studies of protein coding gene eqtl, which revealed predominately  large-effect, local eqtl   <cit> .table  <dig> mirna eqtl

we categorized the mirna eqtl in terms of their effect size and location in the genome. two eqtl, for mir- <dig> and mir-342-3p, stood out in terms of effect size. not surprisingly, expression of these two mirnas also showed the highest heritability in cc founder lines . we confirmed that for both mirnas the expression levels among precc mice with a specific cc founder haplotype at the eqtl were concordant with expression levels in the cc founder strain . we calculated the narrow sense heritability  to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the mir- <dig> and mir-342-3p eqtl, respectively. taken together, these results indicate that cis-regulatory elements at the respective eqtl are the primary determinants of mir- <dig> and mir-342-3p expression in the lung. however, we note that mir- <dig> expression in cc founders suggests three distinct groups , but the allele effects for the eqtl on chromosome   <dig> indicates that this eqtl only explains the differences between cast/eij and pwk/phj vs. the other six cc founders. thus it appears that one or more additional loci likely contribute to mir- <dig> expression; but we did not identify other eqtl  using genome scans in which we conditioned on the chr  <dig> eqtl.fig.  <dig> a large effect local eqtl for mir- <dig>  expression of mir- <dig> in cc founders  and precc mice  as a function of founder haplotype at the eqtl on chromosome  <dig>  cc founder mirna expression was measured by microarray while precc mirna expression was measured by qrt-pcr and data for the latter are presented as −1*deltacq . black diamonds represent means by strain or haplotype

the allele effects for mir-342-3p indicated that the nod/shiltj and pwk/phj alleles were similar in terms of their effect on mirna expression . using publically available array-based genotype and haplotype data from the cc founder strains  <cit> , we found that, like the musculus strain pwk/phj, the nod/shiltj founder strain has a musculus-derived haplotype in the qtl confidence interval . we confirmed that these two strains share a haplotype in this region using more complete single nucleotide polymorphism  data from the sanger mouse genomes project  <cit>  . this finding facilitated the identification of putative causal variants descended from the musculus sub-species that are shared by nod/shiltj and pwk/phj and are different from all other founder strains. we identified  <dig> snps in the region that met these criteria, the majority of which were located in or near  <dig> genes , including  <dig> snps in or near the mir- <dig> locus. two snps  and one indel  were in the mir- <dig> precursor  and thus were considered strong candidate causal variants for the eqtl because the stem-loop structure of the precursor is critical for mirna maturation and expression. the rnafold algorithm  <cit>  predicted an allele-dependent effect for both snps  on the terminal loop of the pre-mir- <dig> stem-loop structure . subsequent analysis using snpfold  <cit>  provided further in silico evidence that rs <dig> significantly alters the conformation of pre-mir- <dig> . these results suggest that at least rs <dig> is likely to cause a change in pre-mir- <dig> structure, which in turn may alter processing by dicer and drosha, and consequently affect expression of both mir-342-3p and mir-342-5p. indeed, among cc founder strains, we found a strong correlation between mir-342-3p and mir-342-5p expression, with nod/shiltj and pwk/phj strains having low expression for both arms of mir- <dig> . we noted that indel  is predicted to cause a change in the seed sequence of mir-342-5p , potentially altering the relationship between this mirna and target genes. we did not measure the expression of mir-342-5p in the precc because its expression levels were very low.fig.  <dig> predicted effects of snps in mir- <dig> on pre-mir- <dig> structure. top: sequence spanning  <dig> ,830- <dig> ,928 bp on chr  <dig> with mir-342-5p and mir-342-3p sequences shown in blue and green, respectively. snps present in the musculus-derived haplotype are highlighted in red and by asterisks. bottom: the sequence of mir- <dig> from c57bl/6j reference strain was used to generate a structure of pre-mir- <dig>  shown on the left. the predicted effect of two snps , present in the musculus-derived haplotype, is shown in the center. note the change in the terminal loop as a function of snps. the predicted structure of pre-mir- <dig> with the addition of the indel  is shown at right



seven other mirnas had local eqtl: mir-146b, mir-181d, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  the allele effects for these eqtl are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  some mirnas had both local and distant eqtl. for example, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> each had one local eqtl  and one trans-eqtl on chr  <dig>  we built regression models for these two mirnas and found that these two loci accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of variation in mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expression, respectively.

the trans-eqtl locus shared by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> was also weakly associated with the expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . we found that each pairwise comparison of mirna expression for all four mirnas was highly significant  and that the allele effects for all four of these trans-eqtl were consistent . this suggests that a single variant mediates allele-specific trans-regulation of the expression of all four mirnas. mirna expression in mice with the 129s1/svimj allele was significantly different from all other strains with the exception of wsb/eij , indicating the 129s1/svimj allele is functionally distinct from most other cc founder strains. this region contains  <dig> genes and we looked for snps for which the 129s1/svimj strain is distinct from all other cc founders excluding wsb/eij and identified  <dig> snps in  <dig> genes that met this criterion: a830035a12rik, abca <dig>  amz <dig>  c330019f10rik, cacng <dig>  cacng <dig>  ccdc <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gna <dig>  helz, prkca, smurf <dig>  and tex <dig> . these genes represent causal candidates for the mirna trans-eqtl. we identified a second set of trans-eqtl on chr  <dig> at ~107-108 mb for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  but the allele effects for these eqtl were not completely consistent , thus we cannot conclude that these two trans-eqtl are one and the same.fig.  <dig> a mirna trans-eqtl cluster on chr  <dig>  allele effects for each mirna eqtl are shown. expression derived from the 129s1/svimj allele is significantly different from other cc founder strains except wsb/eij



the relationship between mirnas and inflammation phenotypes
genetic variation in a mirna has been linked to disease phenotypes . we asked whether the mirna eqtl we discovered underlie qtl we previously identified for two phenotypes: eosinophil and neutrophil recruitment responses to allergen sensitization and challenge. no mirna eqtl co-localized with the eosinophil qtl  or neutrophil qtl .

bioinformatic/statistical approach to identify putative mirna-mrna regulatory networks
as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we used a complementary approach to ask whether any mirnas were candidate master regulators of genes altered during airway inflammation. we first identified mirnas whose expression levels were linearly correlated with eosinophils and neutrophils. at an fdr <  <dig> , thirteen and nineteen mirnas were correlated, respectively. the vast majority was negatively correlated . we then used the mirhub algorithm , which determines whether the predicted regulatory effect of any given mirna on a specific set of genes is significantly greater than expected by chance , to predict whether any of these mirnas are candidate drivers of the gene expression profiles associated with the phenotypes of interest. for the set of genes that were positively correlated with neutrophils , we identified mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as candidate regulatory hubs . no mirna hubs were identified for the sets of genes positively  or negatively  associated with eosinophils . these results indicate that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> may serve as mediators of neutrophilic inflammation by targeting genes that regulate neutrophil recruitment to the airways; predicted targets of each mirna are listed in additional file 9: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> mirna target site enrichment analysis for neutrophils. points in red indicate mirnas with p-values that remain significant after adjusting for multiple testing at an fdr <  <dig> 



mir- <dig> has been previously reported as a marker and/or regulator of other inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease  <cit>  and psoriasis  <cit> . in a previously published dataset of gene expression from human keratinocytes transfected with a mir- <dig> inhibitor,  <dig> genes were up-regulated, and of these,  <dig> were predicted targets of mir- <dig>  <cit> . we found that the mouse orthologs of two of these genes, oxsr <dig> and nsf, were also present in our list of predicted mir- <dig> targets correlated with neutrophils, resulting in statistically significant enrichment . while an overlap of two genes is not large, it is appreciable given the differences in cell types, species, and disease processes examined. we also found that the expression of oxsr <dig> and nsf was negatively correlated with mir- <dig> expression . thus we conclude that mir- <dig> is likely to be an important modulator of neutrophilic airway inflammation in part by targeting oxsr <dig> and nsf.

discussion
we examined whether regulatory variation at mirna loci underlies variation in response to allergen sensitization and challenge using a genetically diverse population of mice. the phenotypic variation across these mice enabled the identification of eqtl for  <dig> out of the  <dig> mirnas  that we studied, as well as suggestive eqtl for an additional seven mirnas. we characterized these eqtl in terms of effect size and location relative to the mirna gene and found that we could explain a large fraction of the total variation in expression for several mirnas using eqtl. some mirnas exhibited appreciable heritability estimates based on gene expression in the cc founder strains, but did not have detectable eqtl in the precc population . one possible explanation is that variation in expression is due to epistasis among two or more loci that lack sizeable individual effects. due to the limited power afforded by the sample size of our study, we did not test for epistatic eqtl. additionally, due to the fact that the qrt-pcr system we used was developed by a company and the primer sequences are proprietary, we cannot rule out the possibility that false negative and/or false positive eqtl we detected in the precc mice are due to snps  that could affect the measurement of mirna expression.

in the case of mir-342-3p, we were able to identify highly plausible candidate causal variants using a combination of sequence data and structural modeling. we found that a snp  located in the mirna precursor is likely to alter the terminal loop of the pre-mir- <dig> structure, which in turn may alter processing and maturation of mir-342-3p. liu et al. have shown that the terminal loop of a pre-mirna affects processing by dicer  <cit> . we suggest that rs <dig> affects the maturation and expression of mir-342-3p, providing a plausible explanation for why precc mice with haplotypes at this locus matching that of nod/shiltj and pwk/phj have lower expression levels. this hypothesis merits further experimental investigation.

out of all the other mirnas we studied, very few had variants located in the precursor sequence and none had sequence variants located in seed regions . this is consistent with other population genetic studies, which have concluded that evolutionary pressures have preserved regulatory networks involving mirnas by selecting against mutations that cause changes in mirna targeting  <cit> . 

one of the interesting results from our eqtl analysis was that distal or trans-eqtl were quite common for mirnas. this contrasts with typical results for mrna eqtl, including our own findings in the same set of samples  <cit> , where local eqtl constitute the majority. our findings are similar to those recently reported for mirna eqtl in human peripheral blood, where mirna eqtl were often located far upstream from the mirna itself  <cit> . in one case, we identified four mirnas whose expression was regulated by a single locus on chr  <dig>  of the ~ <dig> candidate genes in the region, prkca, which encodes protein kinase c-alpha, is a plausible candidate because it is a well-known regulator of immune responses in the lung  <cit>  and therefore may regulate pathways that in turn affect mirna expression.

trans-eqtl were also more common than local eqtl in a previous mirna eqtl mapping study involving an f2-intercross with diabetes resistant and susceptible strains   <cit> . in that study, the authors measured the expression of  <dig> mirnas in adipose tissue in 290 f <dig> mice and identified eqtl for  <dig> of them , three of which were local or cis-eqtl. thus, in comparison, we identified more eqtl  and a larger proportion of local eqtl. it is likely that this can be attributed to the greater genetic diversity present in the cc founder strains versus the two founder strains used in that f <dig> mapping study. five mirnas or mirna family members were measured in that study and were also a part of this study, namely mir- <dig>  mir-34c, mir-148a, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  we detected a similar local eqtl for mir- <dig> but there was no overlap in eqtl for the other mirnas. these differences could be explained at least in part by different regulatory elements responsible for controlling mirna expression in different tissues  and in response to different perturbations . in aggregate, our results and those of zhao et al.  <cit>  suggest that mirna expression levels in mice are more strongly dependent on genetic variation at distal loci than mrnas.

additionally, the lod scores for local mirna eqtl were, on average, lower in magnitude than those for local mrna eqtl we previously identified. hence local eqtl account for a smaller proportion of mirna expression variation than local mrna eqtl. this too is consistent with results from a recent human mirna eqtl study in which local eqtl accounted for ~ <dig> % of variation in mirna expression compared to 30- <dig> % for mrna eqtl  <cit> . our results indicate that the genetic architecture of mirna expression is clearly different from mrna expression, likely involving more loci with additive or perhaps even multiplicative effects. as such, it is perhaps not surprising that we did not identify a mirna eqtl that underlies variation in allergic inflammation in our model of asthma. for a single mirna eqtl to underlie a trait qtl, the mirna eqtl must have a large effect on mirna expression and be causally linked to the trait. while we identified mirnas that are correlated with inflammation phenotypes, none of these mirnas had a single major effect eqtl that explains the resulting variation in inflammation. however, additive or multiplicative effects across mirna eqtl may explain a greater proportion of the variation in inflammation. more complex statistical models will be required to characterize the effects of multiple loci, and this will inherently require greater statistical power.

the bioinformatic analysis we conducted to identify mirnas that may act as key regulators of genes involved in granulocyte  recruitment pointed to three mirnas of interest for neutrophils, namely mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  of these, mir- <dig> is potentially the most promising based on prior work demonstrating that mir- <dig> is highly expressed in airway epithelia  <cit> , and in skin epithelia regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines by targeting genes that regulate nf-kb activity  <cit> . additionally, mir- <dig> is not highly expressed in neutrophils at baseline or after bacterial challenge  <cit> , suggesting that mir- <dig> is not simply a surrogate metric of neutrophil counts. based on our finding of significant enrichment of predicted mir- <dig> targets in our data compared to dataset from human keratinocytes in which mir- <dig> was inhibited  <cit> , we suggest that two genes, oxsr <dig> and nsf, may be novel regulators of neutrophilic inflammation in the airway. nsf  is a cytoplasmic atpase that plays an important role in the exocytosis of inflammatory mediators by disassembling the soluble-n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor accessory-protein receptor  complex after exocytosis  <cit> . using a mouse model of peritonitis, morrell et al. showed that inhibition of nsf resulted in diminished neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum  <cit> . given these data, one simple hypothesis is that nsf in airway epithelium regulates the release of a chemokine involved in neutrophil recruitment, and this pathway is targeted by mir- <dig> 

our results also indicate that other genes with established relationships to neutrophil recruitment are predicted target genes of mir- <dig>  we note three genes in particular: ccr <dig>  a chemokine receptor linked to monocyte and neutrophil recruitment to the lung and other organs , tnip <dig> , which is involved in toll-like receptor mediated innate immune responses  <cit> , and unc93b <dig>  a gene involved in antigen presentation by dendritic cells  <cit> . in combination with prior work in human airway and skin epithelia, our result suggests that mir- <dig> may be targeting genes both in the airway epithelia and in white blood cells , and provide rationale for additional studies on the role of mir- <dig> in neutrophilic airway inflammation. we note that many previous studies have documented an important role for mir- <dig> in multiple cancer processes  <cit> ; thus our findings suggest that mir- <dig> is microrna with pleiotropic effects.

CONCLUSIONS
mirna expression in the allergically inflamed murine lung is regulated by genetic loci that are smaller in effect size compared to mrna eqtl and often act in trans. thus our results indicate that the genetic architecture of mirna expression is different from mrna expression. we identified three mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  that are candidate master regulators of genes associated with neutrophil recruitment. because mir- <dig> is expressed in airway epithelia and is predicted to target genes with known links to neutrophilic inflammation, we suggest that mir- <dig> is a potentially novel regulator of airway inflammation.
