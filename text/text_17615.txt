BACKGROUND
neonatal meningitis  and sepsis is the third most common disease in neonates that accounts for approximately  <dig>  deaths per year worldwide  <cit> . escherichia coli has been identified as the most predominant gram-negative pathogen associated with nm . despite advanced antimicrobial therapy and supportive care, mortality and morbidity rates of nm due to neonatal meningitis-associated e. coli  continue to be as high as 30-50%  <cit> . other than high mortality, adverse consequences such as mental retardation, vision loss or impairment, hearing impairment and speech impediment of nm in surviving neonates are also a major medical concern  <cit> .

plasticity of e. coli genomes has led to the development of different pathovars of e. coli each of which is associated with a particular form of animal and/or human disease  <cit> . genomic plasticity of e. coli is mainly due to the acquisition of ‘genomic islands’ through horizontal gene transfer by means of plasmids, phages and insertion sequences   <cit> . of these elements, bacterial plasmids are self-replicating extra-chromosomal genetic materials which have the potential to transmit a variety of phenotypic characteristics among the same or different species of bacteria . these phenotypic characteristics include novel metabolic capabilities, antibiotic resistance, heavy metal tolerance, virulence traits that are important for bacterial adherence, invasion and survival in host tissues  <cit> . plasmid that encodes such phenotypic characteristics may provide competitive advantages to the bacterium for survival and adaptation to novel niches.

many virulence associated plasmids have been identified in pathogenic e. coli . a vast majority of these plasmids belong to incf compatibility group. structurally, incf plasmids consist of a conserved region common to all incf plasmids which encodes conjugal transfer proteins, replication proteins and plasmid stability proteins and a ‘genetic load region’ or a variable region that encodes various virulence and fitness traits. a recent study that analyzed over  <dig> completed genomic sequences of incf plasmids of e. coli revealed that these plasmids have evolved as virulence plasmids by acquiring novel virulence traits to their ‘genetic load regions’ through is-mediated site specific recombination  <cit> . also, comparative genomic analysis of virulence plasmids in each pathovar of e. coli has shown that these genetic load regions encode virulence traits that are essential for and specific to their respective pathotype  <cit> . these data suggest that acquisition of plasmid-encoded genes may play a significant role in the emergence of pathogens and different pathotypes of e. coli.

although many virulence-associated plasmids in various intestinal pathogenic e. coli have been sequenced and studied, only a few virulence plasmids associated with each pathotype of extra-intestinal pathogenic e. coli  causing human infection have been sequenced  <cit> . for example, at the time of preparing this manuscript, only two plasmid sequences from nmec strains were available in the public domain  <cit> . these two strains represent two of three major serogroups of e. coli  that have been implicated in nm; pecos <dig> from e. coli s <dig>  and pec10a-d from e. coli ce <dig> . despite the fact that the nmec prototypic strain rs <dig> belonging to o <dig> serogroup is the most commonly used e. coli strain to study nmec pathogenesis since 1980’s, its genomic sequence including the plasmid, has not been reported  <cit> . it has been documented that the nmec rs <dig> strain harbors a large plasmid and similar sized plasmids have been observed in other nmec and avian pathogenic e. coli  belonging to the o <dig> serogroup  <cit> .

therefore, the objectives of the present study were to:  analyze the nucleotide sequence of prs <dig> and its genetic and evolutionary relationship with virulence-associated plasmids in other pathogenic e. coli,  analyze the distribution of prs <dig> genes among nmec, and  evaluate the contribution of prs <dig> to nmec pathogenesis by comparing the virulence of plasmid-cured and wild-type strains in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS

initial de novo assembly of short reads generated with ion torrent pgm technology identified  <dig> plasmid contigs ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp in length. these contigs were aligned to the reference plasmid sequence puti <dig> of uropathogenic e. coli strain uti <dig> which was selected as the reference according to the sequence similarity of contigs . complete sequence of prs <dig> revealed that it is a circular plasmid of  <dig>  bp in size with a g + c content of  <dig> % . a total of one hundred and sixty open reading frames  were annotated including incfib and fiia replicons. based on the blast analysis, nearly one third of the orfs  represents the genes involved in plasmid replication and conjugal transfer, along with  <dig> and  <dig> genes encoding mobile genetic elements  and products involved in dna repair, respectively. of the remaining orfs,  <dig> encode unknown or hypothetical proteins, and  <dig> represent genes previously characterized in other bacteria. the plasmid does not harbor any antibiotic resistance genes that may provide a selective advantage in the face of antibiotic therapy. genetic load region of the prs <dig> encodes several virulence- and fitness-associated genes which have been reported in other bacteria . the annotated sequence of pr <dig> was deposited in genbank at the ncbi .figure  <dig>

plasmid-cured strain demonstrated a marked attenuation in vitro and in vivo
to analyze the virulence potential of prs <dig>  the plasmid was cured from the wild type strain by mutating stba followed by 10% sds treatment. curing of plasmid was confirmed by the absence of the plasmid in the purified plasmid preparation and the absence of  <dig> selected genes of prs <dig> by pcr in a crude dna extract made from the plasmid-cured strain . figures 4a and b show the plasmid profiles and pcr amplification results of wild-type rs <dig>  and plasmid-cured rs <dig> . no difference was observed in the growth rates between wtrs <dig> and rs218cured . virulence potential of prs <dig> was determined by comparing rs218cured with wtrs <dig> based on their ability to invade human cerebral microvascular endothelial  cells in vitro and to cause septicemia, meningitis and mortality in vivo in a rat pup model of neonatal meningitis. in vitro invasion assays using hcmec/d <dig> cells revealed a significant attenuation  of rs218cured  as compared to the wild type strain  . furthermore, invasiveness was restored after complementation of rs218cured strain with the prs <dig> indicating its contribution to nmec pathogenesis. similar results were observed with the in vivo experiments as well. although fewer pups died within  <dig> hrs post-infection in the groups infected with rs218cured as compared to the groups infected with wtrs <dig> and rs218compl, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality rates between the three groups . no mortalities were detected in the negative control group treated with pbs or e. coli dh5α. in groups infected with wtrs <dig> or rs218compl, 84-87% of rat pups that survived  <dig> hrs post-infection showed septicemia, whereas in groups treated with rs218cured strain, only 33% had septicemia. in all three groups the number of bacteria in the blood was too numerous to count . also, e. coli were re-isolated from csf collected from 84-87% of rat pups infected with wtrs <dig> or rs218compl whereas only 29% csf samples collected from rat pups infected with rs218cured strain contained e. coli suggesting a role of prs <dig> in translocation of bacteria through the blood brain barrier  to cause meningitis. similarly, histopathological evaluation of brain tissue from the rat pups inoculated with wrs <dig> or rs218compl strains demonstrated lesions consistent with meningitis . the bacterial loads in csf were  <dig>  +  <dig> * <dig> in rat pups infected with wtrs <dig> strain and  <dig>  +  <dig> * <dig> in rat pups infected with rs218cured strain.figure  <dig>

discussion
virulence plasmids in bacterial pathogens have been shown to play a major role in pathogenesis of many bacterial diseases  <cit> . in pathogenic e. coli, virulence-associated large plasmids that are required to establish distinct disease phenotypes have been characterized using in vitro and in vivo studies . recently, it has been suggested that the plasmids may play a role in nmec pathogenesis since most of the nmec strains harbor plasmid-associated genes as compared to commensal e. coli  <cit> . escherichia coli rs <dig> which was isolated from csf of a neonate with meningitis in  <dig> is considered as the prototype strain of nmec. this strain has been used in the studies since then to identify the virulence traits that are particularly involved in nmec pathogenesis  <cit> . here, we determined and analyzed the complete nucleotide sequence of prs <dig>  a large plasmid of e. coli rs <dig>  and studied its contribution to the nmec pathogenesis.

the prs <dig> sequence revealed a backbone typical to incfib/iia-like plasmids in other pathogenic e. coli which possess both repa and repa <dig> replicons  <cit> . in addition to the replication proteins, the constant region of the plasmid encodes proteins involving conjugal transfer  and plasmid stability/inheritance. the tra locus comprises  <dig>  kb region containing  <dig> tra genes from tram to fino similar to f-like plasmids of e.coli and r <dig> plasmid of shigella  <cit> . the plasmid sos inhibition protein , plasmid stabilizing proteins stbab and ccdab, toxin-antitoxin proteins involved in post segregation killing are also present in the constant region that confers stability and inheritance of the plasmid in progeny cells. parallel to these findings, we have observed that the curing of prs <dig> is very difficult with chemical methods such as ethidium bromide and sds treatment alone. therefore, we mutated the stba gene which has been identified as an essential gene for stable inheritance of incf plasmids to achieve successful curing of prs <dig> from e. coli rs <dig> 

genetic load region or the variable region of the prs <dig> contains is elements, virulence-associated genes, and several putative and hypothetical genes. the prs <dig> contains  <dig> is elements belonging to twelve different types. previous studies have shown that is-mediated recombination might play a major role in acquiring novel genes into plasmids thereby allowing the plasmid to act as a “pathogenicity island precursor”  <cit> . interestingly, is elements of prs <dig> are located upstream or downstream of virulence/fitness-associated genes in genetic load regions providing further evidence for such speculation . types of virulence or fitness genes in the genetic load region of prs <dig> are depicted in table  <dig> and are mainly located upstream and downstream of incfib replicon. upstream to the incfib replicon, are the secreted copper-sensitivity suppressor proteins c and d . copper is an essential trace element required for bacterial growth and it acts as a toxic compound if available in excess. antibacterial properties of ionic copper have been studied and used in hospital settings to prevent nosocomial infections  <cit> . the prs <dig> encoded scsc and scsd are identical to copper suppressor proteins in the genomic island gi-dt <dig> of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium str. t <dig> which have been studied in relation to conferring copper resistance in recombinant e. coli carrying gi-dt <dig> providing a fitness advantage to the pathogen  <cit> . additionally, this region encodes several iron acquisition proteins, hemoglobin receptors and a putative abc transporter which may be involved in the survival of bacteria in an iron-limited milieu inside the host. furthermore, prs <dig> also encodes an enterotoxin called senb, which has been found in enteroinvasive e. coli and shigella spp and accounts for 50% of their enterotoxic activities  <cit> . interestingly, nucleotide blasting of senb sequence reveled that it is also present in the genomes of e. coli ce <dig> and the citrobacter koseri which are associated with meningitis in newborns. moreover, senb is located just downstream of cjr operon which is an iron- and temperature-regulated operon expressed only during the pathogenic process of e. coli suggesting that senb may be involved in nmec pathogenesis  <cit> . a recent study reported that mutation of cjr area of puti <dig>  significantly decreased bacterial invasion and intra-cellular bacterial community  formation in infected bladders  <cit> . however, the association of prs218-encoded traits such as senb in nmec penetration of the intestinal epithelium and iron acquisition systems in nmec survival within the host are yet to be identified. other than these putative virulence-associated genes, many hypothetical proteins of unknown functions are present both upstream and downstream of incfib replicon.

furthermore, we screened  <dig> prs <dig> genes among  <dig> nmec strains and fecal e. coli strains isolated from healthy individuals. a vast majority of prs218-associated genes tested were overly represented among nmec strains as compared to commensal e. coli  suggesting a relationship between the presence of prs <dig> genes and the nmec pathotype. these overly represented genes included several hypothetical proteins and virulence-associated genes present in prs <dig> such as copper sensitivity, iron acquisition, abc transporter components, traj and senb.

we also analyzed the sequence similarity and the evolutionary relationship of prs <dig> with other nmec plasmids, namely pecos <dig> and pce10a, and some other incfib/iia plasmids of pathogenic e. coli . the prs <dig> showed a remarkable sequence similarity to four plasmids found in e. coli associated with acute cystitis  and a plasmid present in an enteroinvasive e. coli  . the differences detected among prs <dig>  put <dig>  pec14_ <dig> and pumn <dig> revealed only snps and insertion of a tetabcd antibiotic resistance cassette in p1escum and pecsf <dig> . however, the nucleotide sequence of prs <dig> showed a marked difference from those of two nmec plasmid sequences currently available in the public domain. for example, pecos <dig> shares similarity only with tra locus, repa and repa <dig> regions of prs <dig> revealing that the genetic load regions of these plasmids harbor different putative virulence and hypothetical genes to those of prs <dig>  compared to pecos <dig>  pce10a plasmid showed a relatively higher nucleotide sequence similarity to prs <dig> genetic load region containing the copper resistance-associated genes , cjrabc and senb. however, pce10a lacks the tra locus thereby making the plasmid incapable of conjugal transfer.table  <dig>

among many capsular types of e. coli, k <dig> is the most common type associated with nm and according to previous studies, approximately 80% of nmec possessed a k <dig> capsule  <cit> . neonates acquire e. coli k <dig> mainly from the urogenital microflora of the mother. although there are no studies done on the mechanisms that facilitate the vaginal epithelial colonization and survival of the nmec strains in the urogenitary tract of women, it has been well documented that cystitis causing e. coli can survive and persist inside bladder epithelial cells as ibcs which is a dormant stage that becomes activated and shed when the immunity of the host is suppressed as is the case during pregnancy  <cit> . the same study has also indicated that the puti <dig> plasmid is essential for filamentation of ibcs which is the first event of reactivation of e. coli from the dormant state. a high degree of sequence similarity of prs <dig> to other cystitis-associated plasmids and their close evolutionary relationship suggest that e. coli rs <dig> might use the same strategy to survive in the urogenitary tract. however, the ability of e. coli rs <dig> to invade bladder epithelial cells and to survive within the urogenitary tract remains to be investigated.

pathogenesis of nmec meningitis involves three main sequential events that are governed by the virulence potential of bacteria. these include initial colonization and invasion of gastrointestinal tract, survival and multiplication in blood, and invasion of bbb  <cit> . we examined the pathogenic potential of prs <dig> to penetrate bbb in vitro and in vivo using hcmec/d <dig> cells and a rat pup model of neonatal meningitis, respectively. curing of prs <dig> from e. coli rs <dig> did not show any effect on the growth rate revealing that differences observed between wild type and plasmid cured strains during in vitro and in vivo studies were not due to the differences in their growth rates .

it is believed that the high level of septicemia is a prerequisite for the penetration of bbb by nmecs to establish neonatal meningitis  <cit> . we observed a higher incidence of septicemia among the rat pups infected with wtrs <dig> strain  than the rs218cured strain indicating that plasmid-encoded genes might be involved in developing septicemia. iron is a major limiting factor that restricts the survival and multiplication of bacteria inside the host. the genetic load region of prs <dig> encodes several high affinity iron acquisition proteins, hemolysin modulation factor and hemoglobin receptor which may be involved in iron acquisition. interestingly, these genes were highly prevalent in nmec strains as compared to fecal e. coli . furthermore, in vitro and in vivo study results clearly demonstrated that rs218cured strain is far less capable of invading epithelial and endothelial cells as well as establishing meningitis in neonatal rat pups as compared to its wild type strain, suggesting that prs <dig> might play a role in nmec pathogenesis. the traj which is present in prs <dig> has been previously identified as a potential virulence trait in nmec by signature-tagged mutagenesis and in vitro endothelial invasion assays  <cit> . the mutation of traj was shown to be attenuated in terms of invasive ability to penetrate the bbb. however, more than 50% of the nmec strains used in this study did not possess traj even though the gene was more prevalent in nmec than in fecal e. coli . the present study demonstrated that the curing of prs <dig> offered a greater attenuation to rs <dig> strain than did the mutation of traj alone suggesting that addtionalprs <dig> genes other than traj might be involved in nmec pathogenesis. interestingly, as shown in table  <dig>  prs <dig> carries several genes that encode hypothetical proteins which are also more prevalent in nmec than in fecal commensal e. coli. most gene prevalence studies carried out to identify potential virulence markers of nmec have used already known virulence genes of other expec and only a limited number of studies have attempted to explore novel traits that might be helpful in defining the nmec pathotype  <cit> . therefore, future studies aimed at delineating the mechanistic aspects of hypothetical proteins encoded by prs <dig> and are more commonly occurring in nmec than in fecal commensal e. coli may help to close the knowledge gaps pertaining to our understanding of nmec pathogenesis.

although rs218cured strain was significantly attenuated in terms of in vitro  and in vivo  assays as compared to the wild type strain, it was not completely avirulent. this finding suggests that the full virulence of e. coli rs <dig> requires both chromosomal and plasmid-located genes. further studies including in depth analysis of rs <dig> chromosome will advance our understanding of nmec pathogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
incomplete understanding of nmec pathogenesis is a major hindrance that has been identified and pointed out by many scientists particularly in relation to formulation of novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for neonatal meningitis. the plasmid prs <dig> in nmec rs <dig> strain belongs to incfib/iia subset of virulence plasmids in pathogenic e. coli. these plasmids harbor many virulence traits that are required for bacterial survival inside the host. the nucleotide sequence of prs <dig> showed a greater similarity to the plasmids of e. coli associated with acute cystitis than the plasmids from nmec. however, the prevalence of prs <dig> virulence-related genes was significantly higher in nmec strains tested than fecal commensal e. coli. we have also demonstrated that the prs <dig> is involved in nmec pathogenesis using both in vivo and in vitro experiments. future studies on prs <dig> transcriptome analysis, identification of plasmid-located genes responsible for current observations and in-depth analysis of e. coli rs <dig> whole genome will likely broaden our knowledge of nmec pathogenesis.
