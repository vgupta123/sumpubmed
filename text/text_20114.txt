BACKGROUND
escherichia coli is the most abundant facultative anaerobic bacteria of the human intestinal flora. whereas e. coli usually appears to be a harmless commensal, in other circumstances, e. coli strains can be pathogenic to humans and were grouped into various pathotypes  <cit> . among these, extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli  are responsible for urinary tract, intra-abdominal and soft tissue infections, meningitis, pneumonia and osteomyelitis often associated to bacteremia  <cit> . bacteremia represents the tenth major cause of death in developed countries and among gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli represents the first cause of bacteremia, with 30% of the total number of bacteremias being due to this pathogen  <cit> .

among bacteremic isolates, those that are characterized by specific virulence factors  such as adhesins, capsule, cytotoxins and siderophores are considered as extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli   <cit> , as these vfs are classically described as being necessary to overcome host defenses, invade host tissues and trigger a local inflammatory response  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses  <cit>  suggested that e. coli can be divided into four major groups . generally, human expec strains belong to group b <dig>  and to a lesser extent, group d, whereas commensal strains and less virulent strains belong to a or b <dig> groups  <cit> .

whether e. coli virulence factors influence the severity of sepsis, in humans, is not clearly established. in fact, no association between the severity of sepsis and the four phylogenetic groups or other bacterial determinants was evidenced  <cit> . the difficulty to establish a link between phylogenetic groups on the one hand, and severity of infection in humans on the other hand, can have several causes. in particular, clonal structure within phylogenetic groups and heterogeneity among clonal groups in terms of severity could constitute an important confounding factor. therefore, it appears important to characterize the clonal structure within phylogenetic groups and its association with clinical features.

multilocus sequence typing , in which internal portions of multiple housekeeping genes are sequenced to define clonal diversity, has emerged as a powerful tool to describe the genetic structure of bacterial populations  <cit> . in addition, mlst data allow determining the phylogenetic relationships among deep lineages, providing a complementary view of the population structure  <cit> .

several sequence-based studies were used to characterize clones or phylogenetic subgroups within e. coli  <cit> . previous analyses of expec were carried out on selected strains  <cit> . however, the identity and distribution of clonal groups in unselected bacteremia episodes have not been investigated systematically, and thus, no unbiased view of the overall diversity and distribution of human bacteremic strains is currently available.

the aims of this work were  to define the clonal diversity of all e. coli strains isolated from consecutive bacteremia during one year in two major university hospitals in paris,  to establish the possible association between clonal groups and clinical determinants, and  to characterize the genomic content of the disclosed clonal groups.

RESULTS
nucleotide polymorphism and phylogenetic diversity
the internal portions of eight selected housekeeping genes were sequenced in the  <dig> isolates, with only two exceptions: three isolates  were pcr-negative for trpa, and three isolates  were pcr-negative for uida. all sequences were aligned without insertion or deletion, with the exception of two isolates , which showed a 5-nucleotide deletion in uida, resulting in a frameshift. the proportion of variable sites ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  . considering the  <dig>  nucleotides of the eight gene portions together, there were  <dig>  variable sites. the nucleotide diversity  ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   .

e. coli strains are generally considered to be grouped into the four major phylogenetic groups a, b <dig>  b <dig> and d  <cit> , although some strains may belong to additional groups  <cit> . we characterized all isolates by the triplex pcr method, designed to typify strains into four categories equated to the four major groups  <cit> . based on this pcr scheme, the number of bacteremic isolates classified into groups a, b <dig>  b <dig> and d were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. to determine precisely the phylogenetic diversity of the  <dig> bacteremic isolates, we sequenced the eight gene portions in strains of the ecor collection and performed a joint phylogenetic analysis, together with seven genome reference strains . the results highlighted the strong phylogenetic clustering of e. coli strains into five sharply separated branches. based on triplex pcr results and ecor strains, these branches could be equated to groups b <dig>  a+b <dig>  d, e and a group, which we refer to as group f, comprising strains assigned to group d based on triplex pcr. of note, when genetic distances among strains were considered, the b <dig> branch was more heterogeneous than the branch comprising strains of groups a and b <dig> together. group a appeared paraphyletic, as b <dig> strains were nested within the diversity of a strains. a few confirmed inconsistencies  were found between triplex-pcr and sequence-based phylogenetic relationships, as also reported by others  <cit> . remarkably, the bacteremic isolates were distributed into the five major branches, clearly demonstrating that they do not represent a restricted subset of e. coli strains.

genotype diversity and identification of clonal complexes
the  <dig> clinical isolates were distributed into  <dig> sequence types , seven of which comprised five or more strains, representing 38% of the strains in total . the most frequent st encountered was st <dig> , with  <dig> isolates. sixty-nine sts corresponded to a single isolate, and simpson's diversity index was  <dig> %, underlying the diversity of bacteremic e. coli isolates revealed by mlst. of note, frequent sts mostly belonged to groups a and b <dig>  resulting in a lower simpson's index of diversity of groups a  and b <dig> , compared in particular to group b <dig>  were all sampled isolates were distinct . there was no clear difference in genotype diversity between the two hospital centers, and frequent sts were recovered from each of them.

clonal families within bacterial populations in which homologous recombination occurs, as is the case for e. coli  <cit> , are best identified based on allelic profile comparisons, as the collapsing of nucleotide polymorphisms into allelic numbers is less sensitive to the disturbing impact of recombination  <cit> . as determined using eburst and a minimum spanning tree  analysis , the  <dig> sts were grouped into  <dig> clonal complexes , i.e. groups of closely related sts differing by no more than one allele from another member of the group. eleven major ccs  comprised five or more isolates. based on available complete genome sequences and ecor strains, correspondence of ccs with a previous classification  <cit>  was established . interestingly, no member of subgroup viii   <cit>  was found among the bacteremic clinical isolates. strains of this clone, represented by the ed1a genome strain , have been reported as human-specific and strictly commensal  <cit> . each individual cc probably has a single ancestor for most parts of its genome, and ccs can therefore be equated to clones, as it is very likely that strains sharing seven out of eight alleles have a common descent. although large allelic profile distances separated most ccs, the links among clones disclosed by mstree analysis  were consistent with phylogenetic group assignments. for example, ccs of group b <dig> generally shared more alleles in common than with sts of other groups.

association of clonal complexes with clinical determinants
in a previous work, differences were found among phylogenetic groups with respect to the primary source of bacteremia  <cit> . b <dig> was significantly associated with urosepsis and immunocompetent hosts, whereas non-b <dig> isolates were associated with non-urinary tract origins and immunocompromised hosts. here, we tested the hypothesis of a possible association of particular clones , even within a given phylogenetic group, with clinical determinants .

based on a logistic regression model analysis, we did not find statistical evidence for an association of ccs with a severe sepsis or a defavorable outcome. however, the two major clones of group b <dig>  were significantly associated with urinary tract as a source of bacteremia , in comparison to other b <dig> genotypes. there were  <dig>  urosepsis cases out of  <dig> isolates of cc <dig> , and  <dig>  urosepsis cases out of  <dig> isolates of cc <dig> . in contrast, in the  <dig> remaining b <dig> isolates, there were only  <dig>  urosepsis cases. conversely, b <dig> clone cc <dig> was significantly associated with a non urinary tract origin as primary source of infection . the other clones of group b <dig> showed mixed origins with few urosepsis cases . a number of other characteristics of particular clones compared to other b <dig> isolates were statistically supported: cc <dig> was associated with female gender , although it was not associated with urinary origin; cc <dig> was found only in males , cc <dig> was associated with community-acquired infection  and cc <dig> tended to be associated with diabetes mellitus . these results may indicate heterogeneity of biological characteristics among ccs of phylogenetic group b <dig>  similarly, among phylogenetic group d isolates, cc <dig> was significantly associated with a digestive tract origin of the infection . among group a isolates, isolates of cc <dig> were significantly associated with renal failure , and cc <dig> isolates were weakly associated with neoplasia .

virulence factor content of clonal complexes
virulence factor  distribution is known to differ among the four phylogenetic groups  <cit> . in our previous study, isolates of group b <dig> were characterized by a high number of vfs, whereas those belonging to groups a and d exhibited lower numbers  <cit> . here, we compared at the clone level the presence of nine genes associated with expec virulence, and of the svg orf, recently described as specific for a highly virulent b <dig> subgroup  <cit>  . as expected, we found a strong association between ccs and vf content, particularly among b <dig> isolates . for example, clones cc <dig> and cc <dig> differed significantly by the number of isolates containing hlyc, cnf and sfa . in addition, iucc was significantly associated with cc <dig> and cc <dig> isolates, compared to the remaining b <dig> isolates. the absence of the adhesin papgii was statistically associated with b2-cc <dig>  b2-cc <dig> and b2-cc <dig>  compared to the other b <dig> isolates. in addition, b2-cc <dig> and b2-cc <dig> were almost devoid of the investigated vfs, with statistical support for papc, sfa, hlyc, cnf <dig> and iucc . finally, all isolates of st <dig>  except one were positive upon svg pcr, consistent with previous results  <cit> . only one non-st <dig> isolate  was also positive for svg.

flexible gene pool content of bacteremic isolates
in order to determine the genomic characteristics of clones and to identify possible associations between genetic factors and clinical features, we designed a macroarray composed of  <dig>  probes and analyzed the genome content of a subset of  <dig> bacteremic isolates selected to be representative of the diversity of genotypes . generally, the dna array hybridization results were in accordance with housekeeping genes-based phylogeny and genotypic  classification. cluster analysis of hybridization data grouped all b <dig> isolates in a single major group and other phylogroups were also recovered with few exceptions . interestingly, subgroups recovered by cluster analysis of dna array data corresponded to clonal complexes with a single exception , showing that ccs are characterized by a specific genomic content. in addition, dna array data were fully consistent with the above-described virulence factor pcr results.

because the strongest link of clonal diversity with clinical features within major phylogenetic groups was the association of two b <dig> clones  with urinary tract origin, we concentrated our analysis on the genomic particularities of cc <dig> and cc <dig>  we identified  <dig>  probes that were distributed differently in cc <dig> and/or cc <dig> when compared to other b <dig> isolates , as determined by the template matching clustering approach  <cit> .

among probes that reacted positively with both cc <dig> and cc <dig> but not with other b <dig> isolates, were two clusters of six and eight sequences, respectively   . these prophage sequences are included in previously described genomics islands  <cit>  in the cft <dig> chromosome, respectively φ-cft073-potb and pai-cft073-icda. consistently, these sequences were also present in the o45:k <dig> strain s <dig> , a meningitis-causing strain that is closely related  <cit>  to e. coli k <dig> rs <dig> strain . the two groups of phage-associated sequences were not restricted to cc1-cc <dig> b <dig> isolates  and also detected in some isolates of groups a, b <dig> and d.

genomic regions that were specific for cc <dig> were also identified. isolates of cc <dig> were characterized, compared to other b <dig> isolates, by the presence of three operons composed respectively of three , six  and seven genes  , encoding putative proteins of unknown function. consistently, these genes were present in the genome of cft <dig> , but not in the genomes of strains  <dig>  and s <dig> . moreover, these operons were detected in none of the non-b <dig> isolates. in addition, a large dna region from cft <dig>  was detected more significantly in cc <dig> isolates than in other b <dig> isolates , and all isolates of groups a, b and d were negative for this dna region . this region comprised three genes  encoding two putative membrane export proteins and a putative rtx exotoxin a. regarding cc1-associated genes, only two bacteriophage proteins described in rs <dig>  genome, one q homolog phage protein and a k- <dig> mg <dig> hypothetical protein , were found. conversely, two groups of sequences were always absent from cc <dig> and cc <dig> but present in most other b <dig> isolates .

discussion
we analyzed the phylogenetic diversity of an unselected set of  <dig> consecutive bacteremic e. coli isolates, and compared the genomic content of a representative subset of genotypes in order to investigate the link between clonal diversity, gene content and clinical correlates of bacteremia.

bacteremic isolates were distributed across the entire span of e. coli phylogenetic diversity. the amount of polymorphism found herein is consistent with values reported in e. coli, based on other housekeeping genes  <cit> . amounts of polymorphism among bacteremia isolates were only slightly lower than a recent study of  <dig> isolates from freshwater beaches  <cit> . for example, the authors found  <dig> uida alleles with 12% polymorphic sites, whereas we found  <dig> uida alleles and  <dig> % polymorphic sites . consequently, our results clearly indicate that human e. coli bacteremia strains are genetically highly diverse. of note, avian pathogenic e. coli strains  overlap only partly with the human expec population, with some potentially zoonotic clonal groups being found both in humans and birds, while other apec clonal groups are rare or absent among human expec  <cit> . thus, total expec diversity may exceed the large diversity of human bacteremic isolates alone.

although it was not the main purpose of this study, we noted that our combined analysis of bacteremic isolates and of ecor reference strains using clonalframe revealed the existence of sharp demarcations among deep branches, suggesting a much stronger structure within the e. coli species than previously disclosed based on recombination-sensitive phylogenetic analyses, such as the neighbor-joining method. so far, methods that detect homologous recombination events and account for these in phylogenetic reconstruction have not been used widely in e. coli, and it is likely that phylogenetic group demarcation may have been problematic until now given the effects of homologous recombination, which tends to homogenize e. coli diversity and blur the neat borders that may delineate independently evolving phylogenetic lineages  <cit> . in addition, classification into only four major groups appears to be an oversimplification of a more complex reality. the five major branches disclosed herein do not correspond totally to previous group definitions, as groups a and b <dig> were not well separated, and as branch f could not be equated to any previously described group. these results challenge the classical view of the internal phylogenetic structure of e. coli, in agreement with recent studies  <cit> .

our initial hypothesis was that clones, rather than entire phylogenetic groups, may be more relevant natural entities to establish an association of genotype with phenotype, including clinical correlates of bacteremic isolates. in order to define groups of closely related genotypes, we used allelic profile-based comparisons, rather than nucleotide sequence-based analysis  <cit> . because the later approach is sensitive to homologous recombination, analysis of allelic profiles is preferred for clone definition in many bacterial species  <cit> . among e. coli bacteremic isolates, a number of ccs, which can be equated to clones, could thus be defined. interestingly, the central genotype of ccs, inferred to represent the founder of the clone, generally had a higher frequency than its variants, consistent with currently ongoing or recent expansion of the clones  <cit> . for the purposes of classification, it is noteworthy that most ccs were separated by large allelic profile distances , highlighting the neat demarcation among them. phylogenetic group b <dig> appeared to be the most strongly structured group, as most isolates were grouped into nine ccs .

we explored the hypothesis that clinical correlates and distribution of particular genes would be associated with specific clonal backgrounds, rather than being distributed widely across e. coli diversity. because horizontal gene transfer occurs among e. coli strains, virulence genes that confer specific advantages e.g. for urinary tract infection can be distributed in various genomic backgrounds. however, association of specific genes with particular genomic backgrounds  can be retained, at least in the short term, by predominantly vertical transmission e.g. for genes that are not harbored on mobile elements. in this case, knowledge of the clonal background would have predictive value regarding gene content and corresponding phenotypes  <cit> .

consistent with our initial hypothesis that particular clones may exhibit clinically relevant features, several correlations were established between some ccs and clinical data. most notably, cc <dig> and cc <dig> were clearly associated with isolates responsible for urosepsis; these ccs correspond to previously-described subgroups ii  and ix , corresponding to strains responsible of urosepsis and of neonatal meningitis, respectively  <cit> . hence, the previously held association of b <dig> as a whole with urosepsis may be an oversimplification due to the strong contribution of cc <dig> and cc <dig> to isolates of this group, and may thus not be valid for all b <dig> strains. interestingly, we detected by dna array analysis, two specific gene clusters associated with cc <dig> and cc <dig>  these sequences, which correspond to cryptic prophages, were previously described as being located in two consecutive genomic islands  <cit> . consistent with our results, one of these clusters, pai-cft073-icda, was described as being more frequent among pyelonephritis isolates  <cit> . likewise, a specific dna region encoding to a putative rtx protein was significantly associated to cc <dig> isolates. a first rtx-toxin described in e. coli, hemolysin a, has been clearly associated with pyelonephritis and implicated in inflammation during urinary tract infection  <cit> . some upec strains including cft <dig> harbor two operons of this toxin, and the specific role of each copy remains unclear  <cit> . whether the new putative rtx toxin constitutes an advantage to cc <dig> isolates and could explain their specific urovirulence remains to be determined.

as assessed by pcr and dna array hybridization, clonal complexes were characterized by specific gene content. for example, isolates belonging to cc <dig> exhibited significantly more vfs  than cc <dig> isolates, and orf svg was associated with cc <dig>  in addition, the pattern of gene content variation  was highly concordant with clonal complexes, clearly illustrating that genomic background as assessed by mlst and gene content are strongly correlated. this pattern is consistent with the well-established mechanisms of deletion or acquisition of entire pais  <cit> . in order to get clues into the possible biological and clinical significance of gene content differences among clones, it will be necessary to combine functional studies with the analysis of e. coli isolates from other sources. for example, comparing the gene content of bacteremic and commensal isolates within a single clone should provide insights into microevolutionary events leading to increased or decreased pathogenic potential.

our results confirmed that most of the usually recognized extra-intestinal vfs  were concentrated in the virulent ccs, particularly those belonging to phylogenetic group b <dig>  in contrast, others vfs, for example those related to the plasmid-encoded iron uptake system , were more broadly distributed  <cit> . therefore, for highly mobile genetic elements , the association with clonal background may not be retained.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we characterized the clonal diversity of all consecutive isolates responsible for bacteremia during one year in two hospitals, revealing for the first time their distribution into phylogenetic groups and clonal groups in an unbiased way. we demonstrated the existence of differences in gene content or clinical parameters among some of the major clonal families identified. although they should be confirmed on larger populations to be firmly established, these results confirm that particular sts, ccs or phylogenetic subgroups, rather than the more inclusive higher categories known as major phylogenetic groups, will be relevant units of pathogenicity. however, the heterogeneity of gene content within clones, although limited, may be highly significant clinically, which in turn suggests that finer phylogenetic subdivisions within ccs may also differ in clinically important characteristics. the failure to associate ccs with severity of clinical outcome may also indicate that the characteristics of the host play a dominant role.
