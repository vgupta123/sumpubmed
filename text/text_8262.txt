BACKGROUND
many studies have focused on the effects of assisted reproductive technology  on children's health. art babies now account for approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all births in france and in the united states, respectively  <cit> . singleton pregnancies obtained after art are at a higher risk for adverse perinatal outcomes than natural pregnancies. these risks include perinatal mortality, preterm delivery, and low birth weight  <cit> . since low birth weight has been associated to increased rates of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in adulthood, art is at least a partial cause of such long-term consequences  <cit> . different studies have also reported rare congenital malformations  <cit> , chromosomal abnormalities  <cit> , and alterations of cognitive and motor development  <cit> . however it has been difficult to assess the real interaction effects between the mode of conception and the incidence of these anomalies. recently, the concept of epigenetic risk has associated disturbances of embryonic development with aberrant genomic imprinting. some reports suggest that art increases the risk of diseases such as the beckwith-wiedemann syndrome , prader willi syndrome , angelman syndrome  and silver-russel syndrome   <cit> .

genomic imprinting leads to a parent-of-origin specific gene expression. imprinted genes are known to play important roles in regulating embryonic growth, placental functions  <cit> , postnatal metabolic pathways and behavior associated with the control of resources  <cit> . moreover, oncogenesis may also be associated with altered epigenetic regulations  <cit> .

imprinted genes  <cit>  are generally located in clusters, epigenetically marked by dna methylation on key regulatory sequences , by histone modifications  and often associated with antisense rnas  <cit> . the allele specific methylation of dmrs occurs in germ cells and provides a heritable "memory" that must be maintained throughout fertilization and embryo development. the differential methylation at dmrs is preserved during preimplantation development, in spite of genome-wide changes in global dna methylation occurring at these early stages  <cit> . during this period of dynamic epigenetic changes, environmental manipulations, such as hormone-induced superovulation, in vitro fertilization  and embryo culture, could modify genomic imprints and have deleterious effects on later fetal and postnatal stages.

few studies have reported on the imprinted gene expression in human preimplantation embryos, due to major limitations, such as the scarcity of embryos available for research and the associated ethical restrictions. a monoallelic paternal expression has been shown for both snrpn  <cit>  and igf <dig>  <cit> . more recently, dna methylation analysis of control regions of the snrpn gene and dlk1/gtl <dig> locus on human early embryo has been reported  <cit> . most studies made use of mouse models in order to evaluate the impact of in vitro fertilization and/or embryo culture using various culture media. using preimplantation embryos , an aberrant imprinting of h <dig> gene has been previously found under different culture conditions  <cit> . after implantation, embryonic tissues preserved correct genomic imprints although aberrant h <dig> imprinting was maintained in some placentae  <cit> . however, alteration of allele-specific methylation of h <dig> gene was shown in fetuses obtained from embryos cultured in medium supplemented with fetal calf serum  <cit> . finally studies on the long-term effects of in vitro culture on mouse embryos have shown by analyzing development and behavioral parameters in relation to imprinting, that the postnatal development could be affected by embryo culture during the preimplantation period  <cit> .

visual observation of blastocysts suggests a great individual variability of development after ivf and embryo culture. knowledge about the molecular grounds of such variation is still scarce, but could be of interest for optimizing culture and ivf conditions. many important questions remain unanswered, such as whether all blastocysts or only a subset lose genomic imprinting and whether a relationship between blastocyst development and genomic imprinting can be observed.

in this study, we wished to address the impact of superovulation, fertilization methods and culture media in the same experimental design . daily observations of each embryo were carried out in order to establish individual cleavage kinetics and analyze the resulting blastocyst morphology. the maternally expressed h <dig> gene appears to be more sensitive to environmental manipulations than other imprinted genes  <cit> . to add to the previous knowledge about this locus, we developed techniques enabling to assess the methylation level of both h <dig> imprinting control region  and proximal part of h <dig> promoter , as well as h <dig> expression level from single embryos brought to the blastocyst stage .

the murine h <dig> gene, located on mouse chromosome  <dig> distal part, is composed of five exons and four small introns and encodes a  <dig> -kb non coding rna . it is controlled by an icr located  <dig> kb upstream of the start of h <dig> transcription and containing cpg dinucleotides methylated on the paternal allele only. differential methylation of this sequence occurs during male gametogenesis and is maintained during the genome-wide demethylation that occurs before implantation  <cit> . moreover, on four sites of the unmethylated maternal icr, the binding of a zinc finger protein called ctcf  <cit>  creates a boundary element controlling expression of the neighboring igf <dig> gene  <cit> . the maternal icr is also protected from de novo methylation which occurs at the blastocyst stage  <cit> . the proximal promoter is methylated on the paternal allele and contributes to silence h <dig> gene expression  <cit> .

in this study, we show that there is an important variability of all analyzed parameters between individual blastocysts within the same experimental group. nevertheless, environmental manipulations have a high impact on early embryo development, methylation status of h <dig> regulatory regions, and expression of h <dig> gene. the culture conditions strongly influence cleavage kinetics and embryo morphology. the fertilization step followed by embryo culture appears to be a key period for epigenetic changes. in addition, we demonstrate that superovulation is involved in disruption of h <dig> gene expression in blastocysts.

RESULTS
in vitro development and culture media influence blastocyst maturity
in order to determine the effect of different environmental manipulations, we analyzed the morphology of blastocysts at day  <dig> after fertilization . when fertilization and embryo development occurred in vivo, there was no difference of blastocyst maturity between superovulated and non-superovulated mice . after in vivo fertilization and in vitro development , blastocysts were more mature on day  <dig> than blastocysts which developed in vivo . the proportion of fully expanded and hatching blastocysts was  <dig> % in group c versus  <dig> % in groups a + b . the fertilization method did not influence the in vitro embryo development since the percentage of fully expanded and hatching blastocyst was  <dig> % after ivf . the drastic effects of in vitro development on blastocyst maturity were modulated by the culture medium used. there was a greater proportion of hatching blastocysts when embryos from groups c and d were cultured in g <dig> /g <dig>  medium  compared to m <dig> medium . furthermore, the morphometric analysis at day  <dig> showed equal blastocyst perimeter and area means in groups a and b. the perimeter and area means tended to increase in groups c and d when blastocysts were cultured in g <dig> /g <dig>  medium as compared to those in m <dig> medium. blastocysts from group c were significantly larger than blastocysts from group b .

culture media influence embryo cleavage kinetics and have various impacts according to the fertilization method
to analyze the effects of different culture media on preimplantation embryo development, a detailed analysis of cleavage kinetics was done each day for embryos from in vivo  and in vitro fertilization , cultured in both media from one cell stage to blastocyst stage . differences of cleavage kinetics between both media were observed as early as day  <dig> and maintained until day  <dig> of culture, with a faster cell cycle in the sequential g <dig> /g <dig>  medium than in m <dig> medium in both groups c and d.

almost all zygotes from group d  developed to the  <dig> cell-stage at day  <dig> of culture  and  <dig> % in sequential g <dig> /g <dig>  medium ). at day  <dig>  difference of cleavage kinetics was observed with  <dig> % of embryos at the 4-cell stage in m <dig> medium versus  <dig> % in g <dig> /g <dig>  medium . this difference of cleavage kinetics between both media was maintained until day  <dig> of culture. at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  a significantly higher number of embryos reached the morula and blastocyst stage in g <dig> /g <dig>  compared to m <dig> medium . finally the number of atretic embryos was two fold higher in m <dig> compared to g <dig> /g <dig>  medium at day  <dig> .

zygotes from group c  exhibited similar differences in cleavage kinetics between the two media. embryo cleavage occurred faster in the sequential g <dig> /g <dig>  compared to m <dig> medium . we also found in group c that the percentage of atretic embryos at day  <dig> was significantly increased after culture in m <dig> compared with g <dig> /g <dig>  medium . in conclusion, we observed that embryos from group c reached the second cell cycle earlier than those from group d with a significant enhancing effect of g <dig> /g <dig>  sequential medium.

methylation analysis
the methylation status was determined by two methods: cloning and sequencing of pcr products from amplification of bisulfite mutated genomic dna of individual blastocysts and direct sequencing of this same pcr product. to validate the direct sequencing approach, ten clones from each blastocyst were sequenced as well as the pcr product, in both orientations. overall, one hundred clones were analyzed for a total of ten blastocysts from the different experimental groups . for each cpg position analyzed, the allele specific methylation status observed by cloning-sequencing analysis appeared always as a single nucleotide polymorphism , also visible after direct sequencing . alternatively, the unmethylated status of a given cpg obtained by cloning and sequencing appeared as a thymine by direct sequencing. by contrast, a methylated status observed by cloning/sequencing appears as a cytosine by direct sequencing. therefore, we concluded that the direct sequencing analysis was clearly representative of the blastocyst methylation status. the expected allele-specific methylation status was easily discriminated from absence of methylation as shown in figure  <dig>  after this validation step, direct sequencing was systematically used in further experiments.

fertilization method followed by embryo culture affects the methylation status of the h <dig> icr and proximal part of h <dig> promoter with modulation by the culture medium
the methylation status of the h <dig> icrctcf 1– <dig> region was assessed h <dig> for  <dig> cpg positions on  <dig> individual blastocysts. a preserved differential methylation of h <dig> icrctcf 1– <dig> was found for each analyzed cpg of embryos fertilized in vivo as measured in  <dig> blastocysts of group a,  <dig> of group b,  <dig> of group c cultured in m <dig> medium and  <dig> of group c in g <dig> /g <dig>  medium . methylation defects were often observed after in vitro fertilization in blastocysts of group d and in both culture media . in this group, the proportion of individual blastocysts with unmethylated alleles and the number of non-methylated cpgs were more important when cultured in m <dig> compared to sequential g <dig> /g <dig>  medium . only one blastocyst out of  <dig> from group d m <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> from group d g <dig> /g <dig>  had a correct differential methylation status at all the cpg positions. the unmethylated cpgs appeared preferentially outside of the ctcf binding sites, thereby possibly reducing the deleterious consequences of the anomaly.

analysis of  <dig> cpg positions of the h <dig> icrctcf 3– <dig> region was done in  <dig> individual blastocysts:  <dig> of group b,  <dig> of group d cultured in m <dig> and  <dig> of group d cultured in g <dig> /g <dig> . methylation defects of the h <dig> icrctcf 3– <dig> region were also observed in blastocysts of group d obtained from both culture media but in a lower number of blastocysts as compared to the h <dig> icrctcf 1– <dig> region .

in order to identify possible epigenetic defects affecting the h <dig> promoter, normally differentially methylated, we also assessed its methylation status for  <dig> cpg positions  on  <dig> individual blastocysts. for blastocysts fertilized and developed in vivo, the expected allele specific methylation was found . methylation defects were observed for  <dig> blastocysts out of  <dig> from group d m <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> from group d g <dig> /g <dig> .

finally, the methylation status was analyzed according to the maturity of blastocysts obtained from group d . clearly, the expected specific allele methylation was more often observed in hatching blastocysts, which correlates methylation defects with abnormal or failing developmental processes.

superovulation disturbs h <dig> gene expression in individual blastocysts
analysis of h <dig> gene expression by real time quantitative rt-pcr was done in  <dig> individual blastocysts:  <dig> from group a,  <dig> from group b,  <dig> from group c m <dig>   <dig> from group c g <dig> /g <dig> ,  <dig> from group d m <dig> and  <dig> from group d g <dig> /g <dig> . expression of the sdha housekeeping gene was detected in 113/ <dig> blastocysts . the proportion of blastocysts without sdha detection was similar in all groups, suggesting that the quality of mrna preparation was not influenced by the different modes of embryo collection. among the sdha+ blastocysts, two subpopulations were observed, one with detectable h <dig> transcripts  and the other without detectable h <dig> transcripts. the proportion of h19+/h19- blastocysts varied according to the experimental groups . the proportion of h19+ blastocysts was significantly higher in group a versus each other group . in group c, this proportion was higher for embryos cultured in g <dig> /g <dig>  medium versus m <dig> medium . in group d, the same difference was visible, although not significant. the calculated mean of relative h <dig> rna expression level taking into account the housekeeping gene  expression as an internal standard sample, showed no significant difference between the groups, probably owing to the high variability of h <dig> expression inside each group . however, the median value in group a was higher than that of groups where fertilization occurred after superovulation, as shown by a non-parametric test .

in all experimental groups analyzed, the h <dig> expression potentiality of blastocysts was not correlated with the maturity stage. to further investigate the potential importance of h <dig> gene expression variability, we also analyzed the cleavage kinetics of embryos from h <dig> null mutated mice   <cit> . the oocytes lacking h <dig> produced from h19Δ <dig> mice were submitted to in vivo or in vitro fertilization procedures, followed by embryo culture in g <dig> /g <dig>  medium . similar fertilization rate, early embryo development and blastocyst maturity were observed in this mouse model as compared to the previously analyzed groups c and d . we conclude from these results that lack of h <dig> does not affect these first preimplantation stages.

discussion
the results described in our study highlight the interest to investigate precisely the impact of art micromanipulations on changing epigenetic patterns. we combined several factors of art process such as superovulation, ivf and culture medium and analyzed their putative effects on early embryo development. furthermore, we performed for the first time on individual blastocysts, the methylation and expression analysis of the imprinted h <dig> gene, as a sensitive marker to environmental alterations. we clearly show that there is an important variability between individual blastocysts, that each environmental manipulation has an impact on embryo development and that the choice of the culture medium can modulate embryo responsiveness.

in our study, in vitro fertilization was routinely performed in m <dig> medium. using the observation of two pronuclei as a criterion of optimal fertilization, a high rate of zygotes was obtained . the same medium was also used for in vitro blastocyst development. this basic culture medium was then compared with the more complex g <dig> /g <dig>  sequential medium which is commonly utilized in human ivf. using these two culture systems, our results showed significant differences in the kinetics of embryo cleavage and embryo morphology up to the blastocyst stage.

the embryo cleavage kinetic differences were observed as early as the second cell division at day  <dig>  the presence of non essential amino acids in g <dig>  medium  compared to m <dig> medium, improved the development to the 4-cell stage as previously shown  <cit> . the addition of essential amino acids in g <dig>  medium from day  <dig> of culture is known to increase the frequency of hatching blastocysts, in association with a significant increase of cell number, preferentially in the inner cell mass of embryos  <cit> . the uptake of specific amino acids, notably leucine, isoleucine and valine, has been shown to occur during the blastocyst formation and expansion in vitro, suggesting a critical developmental role  <cit> .

our data also show that the fertilization method modified the sensitivity of embryos to culture medium. after in vivo fertilization, the modifications of cleavage kinetics induced by the g <dig> /g <dig>  medium were more marked than after in vitro fertilization. at day  <dig>  the majority of embryos cultured in m <dig> reached the 4-cell stage while 50% of embryos cultured in g <dig> /g <dig>  were already at the 6-8-cell stages. these results highlight the importance of metabolic embryo capacities which are established at the moment of fertilization and implicated in its future potential development  <cit> .

interestingly, the changes in embryo cleavage kinetics observed at day  <dig> occur concomitantly with the zygotic genome activation in mice. the maternal-to-zygotic transition of gene expression is triggered by the degradation of oocyte-specific transcripts followed by zygotic gene activation. this process initiates during the 1-cell stage and is evident by the 2-cell stage in mouse  <cit> . the embryo cleavage kinetics and the blastocyst morphology could be a direct reflection of the appropriate pattern of gene expression. the fertilization method and the medium composition could have a potential impact on this appropriate pattern of gene expression initiated during the one-cell stage and could modify the metabolic capacities of the embryo.

in our study, the h <dig> gene has been chosen for its implication in the regulation of feto-placental growth by way of action on igf <dig> expression  <cit> . moreover, a possible link between art and h <dig> imprinting disorders was suggested in humans  <cit> . in mouse, h <dig> imprinting also appears more sensitive to in vitro manipulations than other imprinted genes <cit> . in the present study, the h <dig> icr methylation status has been analyzed using bisulfite conversion on single blastocyst dna. whatever the four groups analyzed, 80% of the blastocysts yielded a pcr product. therefore, a possible pcr bias due to the small amount of remaining amplifiable dna after bisulfite treatment cannot explain the methylation defects found exclusively in blastocysts from group d. the expected allele-specific methylation status at four ctcf sites in the h <dig> icr was observed for all blastocysts obtained from in vivo fertilization and development without or with female superovulation  and for all blastocysts obtained from in vivo fertilization and in vitro development . in contrast, in the in vitro fertilization group , methylation defects were observed with different degrees according to the culture medium. the proportion of blastocysts presenting epigenetic alterations of the h <dig> icr was higher in m <dig> medium as compared to sequential medium. the icrctcf 1– <dig> region showed major methylation defects as compared to icrctcf 3– <dig> where the differential methylation appeared to be maintained. a relation between accurate imprinting marks and developmental ability was suggested by our results since a higher number of hatching blastocysts exhibited a differential methylation.

in a previous study, the methylation of h <dig> icr region containing ctcf sites  <dig> and  <dig> performed on pools of embryos, was affected by the culture in whitten's medium, while culture in ksom+aa approximated more closely the in vivo situation  <cit> . in comparison to these data, our study was performed on individual blastocysts and extended the analysis of the icr to all four ctcf binding sites as well as to the proximal part of h <dig> promoter. this suggests that the icrctcf 3– <dig> region may be relatively preserved from epigenetic alterations after ivf, whereas the icrctcf 1– <dig> is more affected by ivf and culture medium. nevertheless, the discrepancy between our results and previous studies could be explained by strain-specific modifiers affecting the maintenance of h <dig> imprint as mentioned by doherty et al.  <cit> . the authors found that embryos derived from a mus musculus castaneus female and c57bl/6j male displayed a loss of h <dig> imprinting when cultured in whitten's medium whereas embryos produced by reciprocal mating showed appropriate imprint of the h <dig> gene under identical conditions.

after in vivo fertilization, the hemi-methylation of icrs appears remarkably maintained at the early embryo stage, in spite of genome wide changes in dna methylation  <cit> . for h <dig> icr, the paternal allele is methylated  <cit>  and protected against the genome wide demethylation. thus, the icrctcf 1– <dig> methylation defects might be due to a partial failure of this protection, possibly related to a modification of paternal chromatin structure. it is poorly understood which protein factors are involved in this process. in vitro fertilization leads to notably different environmental conditions compared to the maternal conditions. this could generate deficiencies in uptake of substrates essential for accurate methylation process. it would be interesting to know whether other icrs are also perturbed by the in vitro fertilization step.

the hypo-methylation of icrctcf 1– <dig> and icrctcf 3– <dig> lead us to speculate that a loss-of-imprinting could appear in blastocysts of group d since the methylation of h <dig> gene is reported as crucial for its imprinted expression  <cit> . finally, we evaluated the global expression level of h <dig> gene by quantitative rt-pcr in individual blastocysts. we did not find any clear association between the abnormal methylation of h <dig> icr/promoter and a disruption in h <dig> gene expression. however, our results show that superovulation clearly diminishes h <dig> detectable transcripts. this suggests that mature oocytes obtained from superovulation could have cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation defects. interestingly, in vitro embryo development on complex culture medium appeared to improve h <dig> expression levels and to compensate the detrimental effects of superovulation. results obtained on oocytes from h19Δ3mice showed similar results to normal oocytes for groups c and d. thus, lack of h <dig> does not seam to modify embryo reactivity to art conditions during preimplantation stages. it remains to be investigated if later embryonic stages can be affected by reduced levels of h <dig> rna.

our data suggest that preimplantation embryos could possess an important flexibility and could be capable of compensating suboptimal environmental manipulations as shown by a strong individual embryo variability. these various embryo phenotypes could be involved in efficiency differences in implantation and fetal development.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the challenge of our study was to determine whether art manipulations result in altered methylation status or in altered expression of the h <dig> gene. we demonstrate here that superovulation affects h <dig> rna expression levels. this supports the hypothesis that oocyte quality and oocyte maturation could have an impact on embryo quality and development. we also show that in vitro fertilization disturbs dna methylation at specific locations inside the h19-igf <dig> locus. in addition, we demonstrate that embryo culture affects dna methylation as previously shown but culture medium can limit epigenetic changes. finally, the culture medium also modulates cleavage kinetics at early stages of development.

each of these steps can affect expression of h <dig> gene as well as methylation of the regions controlling its imprinted status, in a distinct manner perhaps with no dramatic outcome. h <dig> could be used as a sensor to investigate more deeply each of the parameters in the mouse system in order to improve human experimental procedures.
