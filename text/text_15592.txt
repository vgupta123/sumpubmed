BACKGROUND
the regulation of cellular ion concentrations is an essential process in all organisms, necessary to sustain a multitude of physiological processes including ph balance and ion homeostasis. this process is accomplished mainly through membrane ion transporters. in escherichia coli, among the membrane proteins that catalyze the exchange of ions across the cell membrane  <cit>  are the na+/h+ antiporters nhaa, nhab and chaa, which are involved in sodium ion extrusion. within e. coli and other enteric bacteria, antiporters encompass the primary systems responsible for adaptation to growth in conditions of high na+ concentrations and varying ph  <cit> . it is common for bacteria to have multiple systems for a similar function. the use of one system is preferred depending on the stress as a means to adapt to varying environmental conditions  <cit> . of the na+/h+ antiporters, chaa is unique in that it also shows ph-independent ca+/h+ antiporter activity. chaa is also regulated by mg2+, which inhibits both its na+/h+ and ca+/h+ antiporter activity  <cit> .

the cha operon consists of  <dig> genes, chaa, chab and chac found at ~ <dig> minutes on the e. coli chromosome  <cit> . both chab and chac are proposed to be regulators of chaa however, the biological function for either remains to be established. chab is a 76-residue protein that contains a conserved 60-residue region found in several other bacteria and baculoviruses. we report here the three-dimensional structure of chab determined by nmr spectroscopy and examine key differences between the chab families of proteins.

RESULTS
assignment of resonances
the 1h-15n hsqc spectrum of chab  is well dispersed suggesting chab is a globular, folded protein. complete 1h, 15n and 13c backbone assignments were made for chab, except residues s <dig> and h <dig>  which yielded no apparent amide cross peaks. virtually complete assignments  were made for the 1h, 13c, and 15n side chain resonances. resonance assignments have been deposited at bmrb . six signals in the 1h-15n hsqc spectrum originated from the  <dig> residue n-terminal his-tag . the low heteronuclear noe values  and the relatively low number of long range noe's  for these residues indicate the his-tag to be flexible in solution.

solution structure of chab
the 3d structure of chab  is well defined by the structural constraints  and is dominated by two, relatively long central helices comprising residues h40-q <dig>  and d65-e <dig>  and a small n-terminal helix , which is terminated by a proline . at the c-terminus, a short two-strand β-sheet is observed involving residues y84-k <dig> and w92-k <dig>  a tightly packed hydrophobic core stabilizes the overall fold of chab. the following hydrophobic residues have < 10% of their surface area exposed to the solvent: y <dig>  l <dig>  v <dig>  l <dig>  a <dig>  i <dig>  y <dig>  a <dig>  f <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  v <dig>  y <dig>  a <dig> and w <dig>  many of the hydrophobic contacts are between the two long helices . the c-terminal β-sheet acts as a "cap" for hydrophobic residues from loop  <dig> , which connects helices α <dig> and α <dig>  and residues at the n-terminus of helix α <dig>  and the c-terminus of α <dig> . both central helices are largely amphipathic, with residues d <dig>  k <dig>  e <dig>  d <dig>  of helix α <dig> and e <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> of helix α <dig> exposed to the bulk solvent and contributing to a highly charged chab surface. most notable, an area of negative charge is observed at the highly mobile loop  <dig> and the helices immediately surrounding it. in addition, k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  and k <dig> contribute to a positively charged area while y <dig>  v <dig> and a <dig> present a small hydrophobic patch.

in general, the secondary structure elements of chab are well defined exhibiting rmsd's of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å for backbone and all non-hydrogen atoms, respectively. this is confirmed by the heteronuclear noe data, which show a 10% trimmed weighted mean of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the structured regions and indicate lack of motions on the nanosecond timescale . regions connecting the secondary structural elements exhibited lower heteronuclear noe values. in particular, the loops connecting helices α <dig> and α <dig>  and the two strands of the β-sheet  exhibited noe values below  <dig> , indicating large amplitude nanosecond motions in these regions. these motions manifest as regions with large rmsd values in the structural ensemble . the small sheet region at the c-terminus was also seen to exhibit some motional freedom particularly for the second strand. however, it is notable that its noe values are substantially higher than the surrounding loop.

the chab family and structurally similar proteins
structural homologues of chab in the pdb were identified using the dali server  <cit>  . this yielded several matches with fragments of other structures, the best match being sigma factor σ <dig>  with a dali z-score of  <dig> . a dali-z score greater than  <dig>  is considered structurally similar. another sigma factor, σrn <cit> , with little sequence homology to σ <dig> was identified with a dali-z score of  <dig> . chab, however, exhibits no significant sequence similarity with these proteins. sigma factors are proteins, which bind to dna dependent rna polymerases to form the holeoenzyme  <cit> . although the observed structural similarities do not define a functional role for chab it is worth noting that the σrn domain is classified in the cyclin-box fold of proteins  <cit> , a class of proteins that bind a diverse set of proteins and nucleic acids  <cit> .

an interesting observation can be made when aligning the sequences of chab, σ <dig> and σrn based on their structural similarity . residues in the three structures with < 10% of the surface exposed to the solvent are highlighted in red. clearly, the hydrophobic core, critical for the chab fold  is also important for the fold observed in the sigma factors. key hydrophobic residues appear in similar locations in their "structural space" between the three proteins, forging contacts important for stabilizing the fold. these residues are among the most conserved in the two sigma factor families and within chab proteins.

loop  <dig> has weak affinity for divalent ions
given the proposed function of chab as a regulator and the effect of magnesium as an inhibitor of the ca+/h+ antiporter chaa, we examined the influence of calcium and magnesium ions on chab 15n-1h chemical shifts. the pattern of perturbed shifts  indicates that the highly charged  flexible loop  <dig> and surrounding regions are most important for binding. chemical shift perturbations of similar magnitude and direction were witnessed upon addition of mgcl <dig> indicating that mg2+ has a similar binding site and affinity for chab as ca2+. the observed association constant for cacl <dig> is weak  and not likely to be physiologically significant. given chab's proposed role as a regulatory protein, it is possible that the affinity for ca2+ or mg2+ is increased in the presence of chaa or chac.

a functional role for loop 2?
chab proteins are classified into two major groups based on their sequence alignments . group i consists of chab proteins found in bacteria  and archeabacteria , while group ii contain chab related proteins that are found in baculoviridae. thus far, no chab domains have been identified in vertebrate and plant species. one major difference between the two classes of chab proteins is the presence of the charged loop  that we have shown to bind weakly to ca2+and mg2+ions. the embl european bioinformatic database annotates chab proteins found within group ii  as putative dna binding proteins. interestingly, the σ-factor domains that are structurally similar to chab are known to bind dna at the position equivalent to helix α <dig> in chab. however, the composition of the corresponding loop in sigma factors is more hydrophobic and/or shorter than in chab. members of the chab sequences belonging to group i  are annotated as cation transport regulators based on being part of the chaa operon. the alignment results suggest that the loop  <dig> region, which is only observed in the group i family of chab, is correlated to its function as a cation transport regulator protein. clearly, further experiments are required to test this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
as part of the e. coli structural genomics project, we report the first 3d structure of a member from the chab protein family. e. coli chab is a putative cation transport regulator protein whose structure resembles the cyclin-box fold. chab was shown to have weak affinity for calcium and magnesium ions at a highly charged and mobile loop that is only present in chab family members associated with a cation transporter. we hypothesise that this loop may play a role in the function of chab as a regulator of cation transport.
