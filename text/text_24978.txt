BACKGROUND
large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries have been shown to be critical resources for many aspects of molecular and genomic studies  <cit> , such as the positional cloning of genes  <cit>  and quantitative trait loci  <cit> , comparative studies of synteny and gene organization among different species  <cit> , as well as for local or whole genome physical and genetic mapping and sequencing  <cit> . arrayed, large-insert dna libraries have provided the opportunity for researchers to analyze and share information and resources on specific clones  <cit> . hundreds of bac libraries have been constructed for microbe, plant and animal species  <cit> . however, only a few large-insert bac libraries are available to date for insect species, especially lepidopteran insects  <cit> . this could slow progress for the comprehensive molecular and genomics research of these clades.

moths and butterflies, members of the insect order lepidoptera, are the second most diverse group of animals, with at least  <dig>  named species  <cit> . they are widespread members of the ecosystem, playing important roles as pollinators and prey, and are among the most destructive agricultural pests. clearly, lepidoptera are under-represented in terms of genomic resources and knowledge relative to their biological and economic status. this research was designed mainly to construct comprehensive bac library resources for two species of moths, the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta and the tobacco budworm, heliothis virescens, and one species of butterfly, the müllerian mimic, heliconius erato. these species have genome sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> mb/haploid genome  and are widely-used models for studying fundamental problems in neurobiology  <cit> , olfaction  <cit> , development  <cit> , and immune responses  <cit>  ; and wing pattern mimicry [  <cit> . moths and butterflies are estimated to have diverged from each other at least 50– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the sphingid, m. sexta, is a member of the same superfamily, bombycoidea, as the domesticated silkworm, bombyx mori, the current genome model for lepidoptera  <cit> , and the noctuid, h. virescens, is related to other pest noctuids currently being used for genomic studies including spodoptera frugiperda  <cit>  and helicoverpa armigera  <cit> . here, we report the construction and characterization of six large-insert bac libraries for these species and the first insight into the constitution and evolution of their genomes. the libraries will enable a large community of scientists to isolate and study the genes controlling these processes, provide new tools for lepidopteran systematics, and serve as critical resources for comparative genomic studies and genome sequencing of this important group of organisms.

RESULTS
development of procedures for preparation of high-molecular-weight  dna
one of the most important steps toward construction of high-quality bac libraries is preparation of high-quality megabase dna. since no procedure was available for preparation of hmw dna from these insects, we first developed a method for megabase dna preparation by testing different dna isolation buffer systems and tissues collected at different developmental stages of the insects. the results showed that the day- <dig> pupae  of m. sexta and day- <dig> pupae  of h. virescens and h. erato were most suitable for megabase dna isolation using a buffer system containing  <dig>  m nacl,  <dig> mm tris-hcl,  <dig> mm edta, ph  <dig> , and  <dig> % β-mercaptoethanol. the dna isolated with this method was not only large in size , but also readily digestible and clonable, thus being well-suited for bac library construction.

library construction
the major goal of this study was to develop bac resources that are widely usable for molecular and genomic studies of the insects, including whole genome physical mapping and sequencing. therefore, we constructed two bac libraries for each species with bamhi and ecori in the bac vector pecbac <dig>  table  <dig> summarizes the characteristics of the six bac libraries constructed. the libraries were named msb and msr for m. sexta  and b or r for bamhi or ecori, respectively, hvb and hvr for h. virescens, and heb and her for h. erato. the insert sizes of the library clones were estimated based on a random sample of 200– <dig> bacs from each library digested with noti, a relatively rare cutter in lepidopteran dna, and fractionated on pulsed-field gels. a typical pulsed field gel pattern for a set of random clones selected from the msb bac library is shown in figure  <dig>  the average insert sizes of the libraries ranged from 150– <dig> kb, and the proportion of the insert-empty clones was <5%. each library contained from  <dig>  to  <dig>  clones which were arrayed into 384-well microtiter plates. based on the number of clones and average insert sizes of each library, we estimated that the genome coverage of each library ranged from  <dig> ×– <dig> × genome equivalents, with the two combined libraries of each species having a genome coverage of  <dig>  ×– <dig>  × . based on this and previous studies  <cit> , these bac library resources should be well-suited for many kinds of molecular and genomic research, including whole genome physical mapping and sequencing.

bac library screening
as an independent test of genome coverage, to demonstrate the utility of the libraries, and to isolate bacs containing genes of importance, the libraries were robotically double-spotted onto nylon membrane filters in  <dig> ×  <dig> format and screened with gene sequence-specific probes that are of interest for studies of the lepidopteran models. these included genes involved in olfaction , nerve axon growth and guidance , hormone action , wing patterning , bt toxin action , and ribosomal protein structure , some of which have also served as anchor loci for comparative linkage mapping  <cit> . tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> summarize the library screening results. although the number of hits for individual probes varied widely, which may reflect the uneven distribution of the clones constructed with a single enzyme, the average number of hits in a library was close to the expected genome coverage estimated by the library insert sizes and the genome size . the library genome coverage estimated by hybridization was slightly higher than the values expected by the bac library insert sizes and the genome dna content for the libraries constructed for h. virescens , and slightly lower for the libraries from m. sexta  and h. erato .

probes were derived from bacterial plasmids.

bac end sequences 
to validate the libraries further, estimate levels of contamination by microbial or organellar sequences and obtain some information about the constitution of the insect genomes, one 96-well plate per library, thus two 96-well plates per species, was sequenced from both ends of each clone. a total of 246– <dig> bess were successfully generated for each species . the sequences had an average read length of  <dig> nucleotides, with an average of  <dig> q <dig> nucleotides. analysis of the bess indicated that there was no evidence of contamination with dna from organelles, the e. coli host, or other microbes that were potentially carried by the dna source insects. the sequences are registered in the trace archives of genbank described in methods .

the gc and repeat element contents of the insect genomes
to provide a first insight into the constitution of the insect genomes, we analyzed the bess using the repeatmasker program, with an emphasis on the contents of gc and repeat elements including retroelements, dna transposons, simple repeats, and low complexity repeats . the gc contents of the genomes ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % , with the genome of the butterfly having  <dig> % less gc than those of the moths. a total of  <dig>  kb of bess was obtained from the genome of h. erato. the sequence contained a total of  <dig> repeats, which is equivalent to  <dig> % of the genome. two hundred six of these repeats were categorized as low complexity . this number contrasted with those of h. virescens and m. sexta. h. virescens had a total of  <dig>  kb bess from which a total of  <dig> repeats  were identified, of which  <dig> were categorized as low complexity . similarly, a total of  <dig>  kb of bess generated from the m. sexta bacs were found to contain a total of  <dig> repeats , of which  <dig> were categorized as low complexity . therefore,  <dig> – <dig> % of the lepidopteran genomes comprised repeat elements, of which a majority was categorized as low complexity repeats. the overall percentage of repeat elements was approximately 3-fold larger for the butterfly than for the moth genomes; further, the percentage of the low complexity repeats was > 4-fold larger for the butterfly than for the moth genomes. among the low complexity repeats,  <dig> were longer than  <dig> bp , all of which were obtained from h. erato, whereas all remaining low complexity repeats obtained from m. sexta and h. virescens were shorter than  <dig> bp.

retrotransposons, transposons and simple repeats were also identified in the bess, but altogether they comprised <1% of the genomes. nevertheless, the percentage of simple sequence repeats in the butterfly genome  was about 2-fold higher than those of the moth genomes . moreover, a total of  <dig> retro-elements were identified in the bess of all three species whereas only  <dig> dna transposons were identified, suggesting that retro-elements are generally more abundant than dna transposons in these genomes.

blast hits of the bess
using the discontiguous megablast program to query the database of all organisms available in genbank, we searched for matches to bess of the three species by blastn after masking with the repeatmasker program . one hundred eight  of the  <dig> h. erato bess had a total of  <dig>  hits to genbank sequences, with an average of  <dig>  hits per bes  at the default e-value of  <dig> – <dig> e– <dig>  of the  <dig> h. virescens bess,  <dig>  had a total of  <dig>  hits, with each bes having an average of  <dig>  hits . of the  <dig> m. sexta bess,  <dig>  had a total of  <dig>  hits, with each bes having an average of  <dig>  hits .

bm, bombyx mori; he, heliconius erato; hm, h. melpomene; hv, heliothis virescens; and ms, manduca sexta.

we further examined the distribution of the blastn hits of the bess among different species . of the  <dig>  h. erato hits,  <dig>   were from  <dig> insect species. the majority of the latter hits were from other heliconius species, including h. melpomene, h. doris, h. himera, h. erato, and h. cydno, whereas the remaining hits were from h. virescens, helicoverpa armigera , and h. zea . exclusively,  <dig>   of the  <dig>  h. erato hits belonged to h. melpomene. moreover, we found that both ends of three h. erato bacs, lqcbt <dig> , lqcbu <dig> , and lqcbu <dig> , had more than  <dig> discontiguous homologous sequences each to h. melpomene bacs registered in genbank. these results suggested that this set of bacs may represent homologous regions. complete sequencing of the three h. erato bacs will provide more information about the extent of microsynteny and evolution between these two species.

in comparison,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  hits for h. virescens bess were from  <dig> insect species . the top four values for bes hits included sequences from b. mori, h. melpomene, h. virescens, and m. sexta. compared with  <dig> and  <dig> lepidopteran species with sequences hit by the h. erato and m. sexta bess, respectively,  <dig> lepidopteran species were represented in sequences hit by the h. virescens bess, even though similar numbers of bess  were queried for the three species. this suggested that the h. virescens genome is a broader representative of lepidoptera than h. erato or m. sexta.

of the  <dig> hits for m. sexta bess,  <dig>  were from  <dig> insect species, including  <dig> hits  exclusive to known sequences in m. sexta. moreover, the highest numbers of m. sexta hits included sequences from vertebrates, including mouse , human , and zebrafish , and plants . by comparison to the genomic sequences of h. erato and h. virescens, the m. sexta genome seems to have evolved to be less unique as a lepidopteran, showing more similarities to the genomic sequences of other animals and even plants.

it was also found that most of the homologous sequences were shorter than  <dig> bp. however, large contiguous homologous sequences  were found to be associated with lepidopteran genes encoding proteins involved in hormone metabolism, structural proteins, and metabolic enzymes . an independent search of the bess using blastx in genbank and butterflybase  <cit>  yielded an average of  <dig>  hits per species with high homology to confirmed coding regions of identified genes at e-values less than 1e- <dig> and bitscores in a range of 55– <dig> . additional hits were to orfs with high similarity to features associated with retrotransposons, such as reverse transcriptase, gag-pol polyprotein, and endonuclease  <cit>  and non-ltr transposons found in the silkworm genome, such as tras and sart  <cit> . due to the limited sequencing information, the blastn results and discovery of putative genes are presented as potential features to be confirmed by further analysis.

discussion
we have constructed six bac libraries for three lepidopteran model species . these libraries not only have large-insert sizes  and deep genome coverage , but also have a low level of insert-empty clones  and no detected contamination with dna from organelles and microbes potentially living on the source insects, as indicated by bes analysis. moreover, the genome coverage and quality of the libraries have been verified independently by screening high-density filters of the libraries with a set of single-copy genes or ests. the observation that none of the libraries was contaminated with microbial dna potentially carried by the source insects was expected, because the self-contained non-feeding pupal stage used as a dna source for the library construction had purged their guts at the end of larval development. however, we did observe  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> short sequences in the he, hv and ms bess, respectively, which were homologous to viral, bacterial, and fungal sequences . we believe that the homologues are real, but not from sample contamination because they sit in the middle of bess. these results perhaps provide a line of preliminary evidence for the presence of microbial sequences in these lepidopteran genomes, possibly by horizontal transfer. similar findings have been obtained in b. mori  <cit> . on the other hand, considering the small fraction  of the bac libraries sampled, a more direct test of organelle contamination could be accomplished by using mitochondrial sequences as probes for hybridization. furthermore, since the libraries of each species were constructed with two restriction enzymes  complementary in the gc content of their restriction sites, the genome coverage should be much better distributed along the genome than those constructed with a single enzyme  <cit> . therefore, these libraries could provide useful resources for comprehensive genomics research of the three model lepidopterans.

the libraries, library filters and individual clones have been distributed to a number of laboratories and are presently being used for following studies: 1) walking to wing colour patterning genes from closely linked aflp sequences in h. erato  <cit> ; 2) testing synteny between m. sexta, b. mori, and h. melpomene by chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization using bacs containing orthologous genes as probes  <cit> ; 3) analysis of full-length coding and regulatory regions for the m. sexta broad gene ; and 4) analysis of h. virescens hr <dig> putative odor receptor sequences .

the results of this study  have provided a snapshot of the basic characters of the genomes of a group of ditrysian moths and butterflies which diverged from each other at least 50– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . first, the genomes of all three species are at-rich , with the genome of the butterfly  having an at content more than 3% higher than those of the moths . second, the results show that all three insect genomes contain relatively small fractions of repeat elements , including retro-transposons, transposons, simple repeats, and low complexity repeats. these results are in agreement with the small genomes of the species  which generally tend to contain smaller fractions of repeat elements. of these three insect species, the butterfly genome contains 3–5-fold more repeat elements , especially low complexity repeats, than the two moth genomes. papa reported that the total repetitive sequences accounted for about 26% of the genomic regions linked to wing pattern variation in h. erato  <cit> . the difference could be an effect of more h. erato-specific repeats documented, sampling of a specific region with a higher average repeat density, or both. third, whereas the three insect genomes all contain a small number  of retro-elements, dna transposons and simple repeats, retro-elements seem much more abundant than dna transposons, and the butterfly genome is two-fold richer in simple repeats than the two moth genomes. compared with published information from b. mori, the finding of such a low percentage of repeat contents in these three lepidopteran species is surprising, especially for m. sexta, which is in the same superfamily as the silkworm, bombycoidea. xia et al.  <cit>  estimated about 20% of the b. mori genome to be composed of "transposable elements;" further, early work based on cot hybridization kinetics estimated about 45% of the silkworm genome to be composed of repetitive sequences  <cit> . more recently osanai-futahashi et al. reported that the tes made up 35% of the silkworm genome and contributed greatly to the genome size  <cit> . one may argue that we might simply have not identified all the relevant repeats in the bess, but our argument is supported by the following evidence. the genome of the butterfly, h. erato, contains extremely large numbers  of small duplicated sequences or "novel repeats"  which are homologous to three completely sequenced bac clones  of h. melpomene. this in turn indicates the presence of novel repetitive or duplicated sequences in the h. melpomene genome . large-scale end sequencing of the complete bac libraries will uncover more detailed aspects of these butterfly and moth genomes, and provide more information for fundamental studies of lepidopteran insects in general.

the blast analysis of the sampled bess has also provided insights into the evolution of these insect genomes. it is not surprising to find the top hits are to the sequences of lepidopteran species, but it is quite surprising that the highest numbers of m. sexta bes hits were to the sequences of other animals and plants rather than to b. mori . this finding suggests that although all the genomes have undergone changes since the split from the most recent common ancestor, they may have done so along different trajectories, with the m. sexta genome retaining some sequences in common with plants and animals that have been either lost or modified to a greater extent in h. virescens and h. erato. such a hypothesis can only be tested when more genomic data are available for these lepidopteran insects. moreover, the bess of the butterfly  are well-matched only to the sequences of h. melpomene. this suggests that not only is the butterfly more related to h. melpomene than to the two moth species, as expected, but this group has also diverged to a greater extent, resulting in a higher level of species- or evolutionary lineage-specific sequences. this argument is further supported by the finding that  <dig> of the  <dig> species having sequence matches to the bess of h. erato  were from other lepidoptera. this number is 6% higher than that of m. sexta but 9% less than that of h. virescens. by contrast, the total number of top hits to lepidopteran species for h. virescens bess was  <dig>  or  <dig> and  <dig> more than for m. sexta and h. erato, respectively. therefore, the genome of h. virescens may be a better representative of the genomes of lepidoptera as a whole .

one may argue that the repeatmasker program might not mask the repeat sequences completely because of the limited amount of repeat elements available in the public database; however, this does not appear to have affected the blast results significantly. for instance, b. mori represents the species having the most sequence information in genbank among the lepidopteran species; however, we found significantly different hits,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the bess of h. erato, h. virescens, and m. sexta, respectively . moreover, there are many more drosophila spp. sequences in genbank than for any other insect; however, we only observed limited numbers of drosophila sequence hits:  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the bess of h. erato, h. virescens, and m. sexta, respectively ; there were no large  hits for any drosophila sequence, and only one large  hit each for apis mellifera , for the bess of h. virescens and m. sexta, even though the honey bee genome is also fully sequenced . similarly, a large number of top blastx hits were to protein sequences in lepidopteran species  or other insects , such as acyrthosiphon pisum  and tribolium castaneum , of which relatively few were to drosophila spp .

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed six high-quality, deep-genome coverage bac libraries, two libraries for each of three lepidopteran model species: h. erato, h. virescens, and m. sexta, with two restriction enzymes, respectively. as the average clone insert size of the libraries ranging from 152– <dig> kb, we estimated that the genome coverage of each library ranged from 6– <dig> ×, with the two combined libraries of each species being equivalent to  <dig> – <dig>  × haploid genomes. this genome coverage should be sufficient for many aspects, if not all, of genomics studies of each species, including genome-wide physical mapping and genome sequencing.

genomic sequence sample analysis of the moths and butterfly has provided an initial insight into the constitution and evolution of their genomes. although large-scale genome sequencing is needed to further decipher the genomes of the species, especially their gene contents, the basic characteristics of the repeated sequence portion of each genome is useful information for our understanding of the genomes and their evolution. the high-quality bac libraries of the insects, together with the gene-containing bacs and bac end sequences, provide valuable information, resources and tools for comprehensive studies of the insect genomes and for addressing many fundamental questions in lepidoptera.
