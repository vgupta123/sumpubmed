BACKGROUND
the levels of essential inorganic nutrients have to be tightly controlled inside individual cells and organs, but information about nutrient uptake and needs also have to be transferred between organs to optimize nutrient allocation, especially in plants growing under sub-optimal conditions. if an organ experiences nutrient starvation, it needs to communicate its requirements to the other organs in order to increase nutrient uptake or reallocate resources. this type of communication is probably mediated via the phloem. recent work showed that microrna   <dig> is potentially involved in long-distance communication via the phloem following phosphate deprivation  <cit> . mirnas are short , non-translated rnas that are processed by dicer-like proteins from large, characteristically folded precursor molecules. the majority of plant mirnas target transcription factors and is therefore thought to mainly regulate developmental processes. however, recent studies have also identified mirnas that are involved in responses to nutrient deficiencies. as mentioned earlier, mir <dig> is strongly induced during phosphate deprivation  <cit> , while mir <dig> drastically increases under growth on low sulfur  <cit> . in addition to macronutrients like sulfur and phosphate, also a lack of the micronutrient copper leads to an accumulation of mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . mirnas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were recently shown to accumulate not only on the whole plant level, but also strongly within the phloem  <cit> . since srnas accumulating in phloem sap under stress could represent potential long-distance signaling molecules, we used srna microarrays from lc sciences to comprehensively analyze phloem srnas. the customized arrays contained, in addition to all known plant mirnas, a subset of small rnas  of unknown function that was earlier sequenced from phloem sap of brassica napus  <cit> . first we established the mirna patterns of phloem, leaves and roots of fully nutrient supplied, hydroponically grown oilseed rape plants to subsequently identify candidates that respond to growth under s, cu or fe deficiency, respectively. in addition, we used the highly -s induced mir <dig> as an example to examine whether this specific mirna can be transported over graft unions when combining wt arabidopsis with the mirna biosynthesis mutant hen1- <dig>  the specific aims were 1) to find phloem- and organ-enriched mirnas, 2) to identify additional mirnas that respond to s and cu deficiencies, 3) to examine whether any mirnas respond to fe starvation, and 4) to demonstrate whether mir <dig> is phloem mobile or not.

RESULTS
phloem sap shows a specific srna pattern that is distinct from that of inflorescence stem, leaves and roots
to ensure that the srnas observed in phloem sap were not resulting from contamination during sampling, and in order to identify phloem-enriched srnas, we performed a microarray hybridization experiment comparing phloem sap to the surrounding inflorescence stem tissue. this resulted in the identification of phloem-enriched srnas, while others were less abundant in phloem sap than in stem tissue  collected after phloem sampling from the sampling site. signal values for one mirna per family are depicted in additional file  <dig>  the distribution of ten mirnas was re-evaluated by rna gel blots from an independent set of plants, what confirmed the microarray results. mirnas  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> strongly accumulated in phloem samples as compared to inflorescence stem samples, while mir <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were stem-enriched. this indicates that phloem samples are not significantly contaminated by the contents of the surrounding inflorescence stem cells, what had already previously been demonstrated  <cit> . the observation that mir <dig> accumulates in phloem sap confirms an earlier study in pumpkin that found mir <dig> 20-fold enriched in phloem sap as compared to the surrounding vascular tissue  <cit> . also the failure to detect mir <dig> in phloem sap and its low expression in stem samples is in accordance with earlier findings  <cit> .

we further used the microarrays to identify srnas that preferentially accumulated in phloem sap as compared to leaf and root samples. to this end we grew plants under full nutrition  conditions in three successive, completely independent experiments and compared the srna amounts in phloem samples with that of leaves and roots. for inter-array comparisons, signal intensities were normalized to the median signal of each sample. this approach allowed the detection  of  <dig> mirnas belonging to  <dig> families in phloem sap, covering all  <dig> mirna families earlier detected in samples from soil-grown brassica plants by high-throughput pyrosequencing  <cit>  . in addition, we found several mirnas on the arrays that were not identified by the sequencing approach, suggesting that these mirnas were either not present in soil-grown plants or not identified, possibly due to their low abundance or absence in the steadily growing databases at the earlier time-point of data analysis. a reasonable reproducibility between the experiments was achieved, given that they were completely independent and that mirnas are known to be strongly influenced by developmental stage and growth conditions  <cit> . signal intensities and standard deviations for one representative of each family are depicted in additional file  <dig>  statistical evaluation using the students t-test revealed mirnas that were significantly  enriched in phloem, leaves or roots . mirnas from four families were more abundant in phloem sap than in leaves and roots under fn, namely mir <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  . mir <dig>  together with mir <dig> , was cloned from wheat  <cit>  and recently from brachypodium  <cit> . both mirnas are not well characterized, thought to be species-specific, and their possible functions are unknown. however, signal values were well above the microarray noise. nevertheless this result does not allow a conclusion on whether these mirnas really occur in brassica or if the signals represent an artifact  caused by the microarray technique.

except for mir <dig>  these mirnas were also phloem-enriched as compared to inflorescence stem tissue . mirnas from the families  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were less abundant in the phloem as compared to both, leaves and roots. however, some of these mirnas  were more abundant in the phloem than in the surrounding stem.

mirnas from the complete  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> families were found to be significantly enriched in roots as compared to leaves and phloem. in rice, mirnas  <dig> and  <dig> have earlier been shown occur at higher levels in roots than in leaves  <cit> . in addition, mir <dig> has been described to be expressed in roots of medicago truncatula, where it functions in root and nodule development  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mirnas  <dig> and  <dig> occur root-enriched  <cit> , and mir <dig> has been implicated with root development  <cit> .

mir <dig> was the only mirna that accumulated in leaves as compared to roots and phloem sap . in an earlier study, mir <dig> was found to appear preferentially in rosette leaves of arabidopsis, as compared to seedlings, flowers and siliques  <cit> . according to the same publication, mir <dig> targets a beta-fructofuranosidase, but its function is currently not well understood. although mir <dig> is regarded as being related to mir <dig>  differing in only  <dig> nt  <cit> , both mirnas showed a quite distinct organ distribution: while mir <dig> was clearly leaf-enriched, mir <dig> was slightly, but significantly phloem-enriched, indicating that both mirnas might still have distinct localizations and functions.

interestingly, the unknown srnas represented on the chip were, except for bn_psrna_ <dig>  significantly more abundant in phloem sap as compared to leaves and roots . all bn_psrnas were additionally more abundant in roots than in leaves. most of these differential unknown srnas had a length of  <dig> nt, and only five had a length of  <dig> nt characteristic for mirnas . precursor and target predictions using mfold and psrnatarget, respectively , provided no conclusive evidence that any of these srnas could represent a novel mirna following recently published criteria  <cit> . on the one hand, the inability to successfully predict targets and precursors of the brassica srnas could be due to the limited est genome sequence of brassica napus publicly available. on the other hand, it could indicate that they are no mirnas, but rather sirnas, as yet unclassified srnas, or breakdown products of larger rnas. however, the observation that they accumulate in phloem sap makes them interesting candidates for future studies.

phloem small rna patterns change under nutrient deficiency
since three mirnas, mir <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  had been previously shown to accumulate in the phloem under the corresponding nutrient stress conditions  <cit> , we intended to identify additional nutrient-responsive phloem srnas. they could represent novel information transmitters during nutrient deprivation, as has been suggested for mir <dig> under phosphate deficiency  <cit> . to induce nutrient deprivation, we raised brassica napus plants in hydroponic cultures under fn and omitted the respective nutrient from the medium for two  or three weeks , respectively, before samples were collected. under -s and -cu conditions the plants did not show any obvious stress symptoms at the time of sampling. however, omitting fe led to chlorosis symptoms in very young upper leaves after 4- <dig> days of stress .

initial analysis of the expression of selected genes that are known to be altered by the respective nutrient stress clearly confirmed that the plants were nutrient deficient in all three kinds of stress experiments performed . as expected, s starvation led to an increase in the expression of the two high-affinity sulfate transporters st <dig>  and st <dig> , especially in roots. copper deprivation was confirmed by a slight decrease in the amount of cu-zn sod transcripts, while the amount of the high-affinity copper transporter copt <dig> increased markedly. fe deprived plants showed only a slight reduction in the expression of the iron storage protein ferritin lsc <dig> in leaves and roots, accompanied by an increase in the transcript of the root-specific iron transporter irt <dig> in roots .

subsequently, material from the same batch of plants was used for dual-color microarray hybridizations of stressed and fn samples. since only one array per stress experiment was hybridized, we applied specific criteria to only identify the most drastic positive changes  upon stress treatments and furthermore restricted the analyses to abundant srnas with signal intensities of > <dig> in one of the two  samples.

the response to s deficiency was characterized by a dramatic increase of the known -s-responsive mir <dig> . while the amount of no additional mirna increased, the amount of mir <dig> decreased .

growth under copper deficiency is known to induce a number of physiological responses, including the expression of specific mirnas. recently, the transcription factor spl <dig>  has been found to be a central regulator of the copper-deficiency response. it is able to induce the expression of mirnas  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  different copper transporters, and a copper chaperone  <cit> . accordingly, our mirna microarrays showed that copper deficiency led to a more than four-fold increase of the known copper-responsive mirnas  <dig> and  <dig> that target laccases  <cit>  in phloem sap. mir <dig> also accumulated in roots, but remained undetectable in leaves, while  <dig> responded positively in leaves and not in roots . the known -cu-responsive mir <dig> that targets cu/zn superoxide dismutases also increased, but only nearly two-fold. a similar accumulation was also detected in leaves, but not roots . mir <dig> that was found to be copper-responsive in arabidopsis  <cit>  was undetectable in the phloem, leaves and roots of rapeseed in the present study , probably caused by the different species, compartment, developmental stage and milder stress treatment analyzed. surprisingly, also the phosphate-deficiency-responsive mir <dig> increased more than four-fold . this indicates a slight phosphate limitation in the -cu plants, although the plants were supplied with the same amount of p as in all other experiments. the same was also observed in an independent repetition of the experiment . interestingly, mir <dig> that was recently found to also respond to phosphate starvation  <cit>  was also accumulating under -cu, confirming the noticeable phosphate deficiency already evidenced by the increase of mir <dig> . our results thus confirm that copper deficiency up-regulates mirnas that mainly target mrnas of enzymes that use copper as cofactors, namely the multicopper proteins laccases and copper zinc superoxide dismutases . as already discussed by abdel-ghany and pilon  <cit> , this mechanism is thought to save cu for the most important copper-containing proteins like plastocyanin that is a key protein of photosynthesis  <cit> .

under iron deficiency only mir <dig> increased in the phloem more than four-fold , what was verified by sqrt-pcr in an independent experiment . mir <dig> was described as a non-conserved mirna from arabidopsis that could, for example, not be detected in citrus  <cit> . mir <dig> is predicted to target a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein of unknown function, a lipase, and xyloglucan-fucosyl transferases  <cit> . none of these potential targets has an obvious connection to iron uptake or metabolism, and thus the increase of mir <dig> might be a secondary effect on plant development. moreover, the accumulation of mir <dig> seemed to be phloem sap-specific, as it could not be observed in leaf or root samples . comparative high-throughput sequencing of fn and -fe samples would help to clarify if an as yet unknown  srna increases under -fe, or if there is really no small rna accumulating during this deprivation response.

interestingly, however, mirnas  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> notably decreased during iron starvation, showing an opposite response to their increases observed under -cu . this response was verified for mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by sqrt-pcr from a set of independently grown plants . decreases in the levels of -cu-responsive mirnas were visible not only in the phloem, but also in leaves and comparably weak in roots . a decrease of these cu starvation-responsive mirnas suggests that copper uptake is stimulated by iron deficiency, as has already been observed in brassica and other plant species  <cit> . the need for higher cu uptake under -fe could be explained by the fact that many iron and copper-containing enzymes can substitute for each other when one of the two elements is present at suboptimal levels, e.g. sods, cytochrome oxidase, or diiron oxidase  <cit> .

interestingly, a phloem response opposite to the -cu reaction under -fe was also observed for the -p-responsive mirnas  <dig> and  <dig>  which were more than two- , respectively more than four-fold  decreased. the responses of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were undetectable in leaves and roots . this confirms the observation from a previous study that demonstrated that mir <dig> responds stronger to -p in phloem sap than in leaves and roots  <cit> . the decrease of -p-responsive mirnas in phloem sap suggests that fe deficiency positively influences p uptake and metabolism, what has already been demonstrated in earlier studies e.g.  <cit> . the other way around, high fe can lead to lower p concentrations in the plant  <cit> . if more fe is taken up during growth under -cu in order to replace fe in cu-containing enzymes, this could explain the observed increase of the -p-responsive mirnas in phloem sap under cu deprivation.

taken together, the data from the -cu and -fe experiments indicate a tight link between iron and phosphate metabolism that has earlier been described. moreover, they suggest a close linkage between iron and copper uptake, although it is known that in higher plants this link is at least not as close as, for example, in yeast or chlamydomonas, where iron uptake is directly cu-dependent  <cit> . it is interesting to note that the tissues/compartments analyzed react differentially to specific stress triggers, but the physiological meaning of this observation needs to be evaluated in future experiments.

specific mirnas that accumulate in phloem sap under stress are also mobile in grafting experiments
whether mirnas are mobile between cells and over long distance is still a matter of debate and evidence for transport only exists for one single mirna, mir <dig>  that was able to move from shoots to roots in a mir <dig> overexpressor as scion/wt as rootstock graft situation  <cit> . because mir <dig> is comparably well studied, its targets have been validated in arabidopsis, and it strongly accumulates under sulfur starvation, also within the phloem, we chose this mirna to examine whether additional mirnas are mobile in vivo. to this end, we performed grafting experiments using hen1- <dig> mutants and wt plants. hen1- <dig> mutants are inhibited in srna methylation and, as a consequence, the levels of several mirnas are markedly decreased  <cit> . rna gel blot analysis of the different mirnas further analyzed in our study confirmed that hen1- <dig> mutants did not contain any of these mature mirnas at detectable levels . in all grafting experiments, hen1- <dig> mutants retained their typical phenotype, mainly characterized by growth retardation , what indicates that not all necessary mirnas can be translocated between the grafting partners. after the establishment of graft unions, successful grafts were transferred to media lacking a specific nutrient for two weeks, and mirna abundance was analyzed in the different parts of the graft by rna gel blots. we first examined the abundance of the phosphate-dependent mir <dig> in scions and rootstocks under phosphate starvation as a positive control. as expected, mir <dig> was not only clearly detectable in wt rootstocks and scions, but also in hen1- <dig> rootstocks of independent grafts with similar signal strength as in phosphate starved wt rootstocks . our data thus confirmed the translocatability of mir <dig> from shoots to roots in a graft situation. we further chose mir <dig> as a negative control, since this mirna has neither been detected in phloem sap by srna sequencing  <cit>  nor by our srna array experiments . as assumed, we detected a signal in the wt rootstocks and scions, but not in the mutant parts of the grafts, making a phloem translocation of mir <dig> highly unlikely .

when analyzing grafts grown under sulfate starvation, we observed the translocation of mir <dig> from wt scions to hen1- <dig> rootstocks in different independently grafted plants. we also observed signals for mir <dig> in wt scions, but not in wt rootstocks . however, mir <dig> has been previously shown to be expressed in roots under sulfur starvation  <cit> , and we could also detect signals in roots of intact wt plants . this result could be reproduced in several independent experiments. this could indicate that mir <dig> translocation from shoot to root is required for root mir <dig> expression in the wt, but further experiments will be needed to substantiate this assumption. the earlier studies of mir <dig> translocation do not allow any conclusions about the  existence of such a crosstalk, since a comparable graft situation of a stressed wt rootstock with an "unstressed"  scion cannot be achieved when grafting overexpressors with wt plants  <cit> .

for both, mir <dig> and mir <dig>  we only found signals in hen1- <dig> rootstocks and never in hen1- <dig> scions, indicating that mobility was restricted to the direction from shoot-to-root in arabidopsis seedlings . the reason for this unidirectional translocation might lie in the early developmental stage analyzed, where roots constitute the only real sink organ that needs nutrient supply from the phloem translocation stream. however, the results do not rule out that mobile mirnas can reach other organs than roots at different developmental stages with different source-sink relationships. our experiments also did not allow concluding whether mature mir <dig> or its pt is the translocated species. in the case of mir <dig>  however, it has been previously shown that exclusively mature mirna and not pts is transported through graft unions  <cit> . in addition, no mirna precursors were detectable in b. napus phloem sap  <cit> , suggesting that mature mirnas are the translocated molecules.

the graft translocation of mir <dig> coincides with a down-regulation of the target aps4
to examine whether the translocation of mir <dig> from wt shoots into hen1- <dig> roots might have physiological functions, we analyzed the levels of three experimentally validated mrna targets of mir <dig>  the atp sulfurylases aps <dig> and aps <dig> and the low affinity sulfate transporter atsultr2; <dig>  <cit> . as a general observation, the transcript levels of all three targets seemed to be higher in shoots of hen1- <dig> as compared to wt plants . in addition, the experiments showed that only the level of atp sulfurylase aps <dig> mrna, but not of aps <dig> or the low affinity sulfate transporter sultr2; <dig>  was notably decreased in grafted hen1- <dig> rootstocks as compared to non-grafted -s starved roots of hen1- <dig>  while housekeeping genes remained constant . a similar reduction of levels of aps <dig>  but not the other two targets, could be observed in b. napus wt roots grown under sulfur starvation . these results indicate that aps <dig> mrna might be a target of mir <dig> in roots, and interestingly, this mrna has previously been shown to exhibit root-specific expression  <cit> . the observation that the other mir <dig> target sultr2; <dig> was up- and not down-regulated under -s conditions  was earlier explained by the spatially differential expression of sultr2; <dig> and mir <dig> in xylem parenchyma and companion cells, respectively  <cit> . it was suggested that one of the major functions of mir <dig> was the down-regulation of sultr2; <dig> expression in the phloem to restrict sultr2; <dig> expression exclusively to the xylem  <cit> .

is the transport of specific mirnas of biological relevance in intact plants?
most mirnas are believed to act in a locally restricted manner, in contrast to the mobile class of sirnas  <cit> . their limited mobility is suggested by the closely correlating patterns of mirna transcription and activity  <cit> , the spatial restriction of mirna gene expression  <cit> , and the limited area of mature mirna localization  <cit> . however, phloem mobility of mir <dig> across graft unions has been demonstrated in earlier studies by grafting mir <dig> overexpressor with wt plants  <cit> . in this study, we observed the transport of mir <dig> and  <dig> from wt scions to hen1- <dig> mutant rootstocks. moreover, one of the mir <dig> targets, aps <dig>  was down-regulated in grafted mutant roots. this indicates that mir <dig>  like mir <dig>  is transported from shoot to root to down-regulate its target. however, the question whether such a mirna transport is physiologically relevant remains, since members of the mir <dig> and  <dig> families can indeed be synthesized in roots of wild type plants under the respective stress  <cit>  . interestingly, expression of mirnas  <dig> and  <dig> was shown to be highly overlapping, being predominant in vascular tissue, especially in root phloem companion cells   <cit> .

different scenarios could explain the observation that specific mirnas are present in phloem sap and mobile in grafting experiments: 1) none of the phloem mirnas is specifically targeted for translocation, but instead a portion of all mirnas highly expressed in cc leaks into sieve elements. no mirna would represent a signaling molecule. 2) a portion of all mirnas highly expressed in cc reaches phloem sap, but some of these mirnas can act as long-distance regulators under certain physiological conditions. 3) selected mirnas synthesized in cc are specifically targeted for transport and only these are released into the phloem stream. in this case, all mirnas present in the phloem would be translocatable information transmitters.

no matter how mirnas reach phloem sap, they would then be swept away from source to sink organs . the translocated mirnas would probably exit the translocation stream into sink cc in an unspecific manner, as rather unselective unloading of macromolecules into sink tissues has been suggested  <cit> . here, they would down-regulate their target mrnas, no matter whether they are intended to function as signaling molecules or not.

if certain mirnas should indeed be translocated to transmit information, one possible rationale could be that roots are unable to synthesize sufficient amounts of these mirnas under stress, or that they need a trigger from the shoot to initialize mirna synthesis. this might be suggested by the absence of mature mir <dig> in wt rootstocks of grafted plants that was, however, well detectable in roots of complete wt plants . another explanation might be that some organs experience nutrient deprivation earlier than others, and that the translocated mirnas serve to coordinate physiological responses with plant parts that are not yet stressed and therefore do not yet synthesize stress-responsive mirnas themselves. this would resemble the situation in grafted plants, where only scions of the graft produced the stress-induced mirnas , while rootstocks did not .

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that the phloem sap srna complement is distinct from that of stems, leaves and roots, and that a set of phloem-enriched srnas exists. it also shows that the abundance of several phloem sap srnas changes under nutrient deficiency conditions. while the results confirmed that the known mirnas reacting to -s or -cu, respectively, also respond in phloem sap, they provided no clear indications that the response to -fe involves mirna regulation, despite of influencing copper uptake/metabolism.

grafting studies between wt plants and hen1- <dig> mutants demonstrated that two phloem stress-reactive mirnas,  <dig> and  <dig>  can indeed be transported from shoot to root in arabidopsis seedlings, and that this translocation leads to a reduction of the amount of their target mrnas in roots. the grafting experiments also revealed that not all mirnas are phloem translocatable, since mir <dig> did not move.

therefore, this study demonstrates that identifying phloem-enriched macromolecules and analyzing their translocation in grafting studies is a very useful approach to distinguish between phloem translocatable and non-mobile molecules. it is tempting to classify mir <dig> and  <dig> as systemic signaling molecules, because they not only move from source to sink, but also induce a measurable effect on their target mrnas in sink tissue in grafting experiments. however, we conclude that profiling phloem components combined to grafting studies is still not sufficient to doubtless decide whether a phloem-translocatable macromolecule is really a long-distance signal or not.
