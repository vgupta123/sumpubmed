BACKGROUND
paracoccidioidomycosis , the most important systemic mycosis in latin america, is a chronic granulomatous disease that affects about  <dig> million people.

paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a thermally dimorphic fungus pathogen, is the pulmonary infective agent  <cit> . this initial interaction appears to govern the subsequent mechanisms of innate and acquire immunity, which result in localized infection or overt disease  <cit> .

the mechanisms of adherence and invasion have been studied extensively in pathogenic bacteria  <cit> , and in pathogenic fungi such as candida albicans  <cit> , histoplasma capsulatum  <cit>  and aspergillus fumigatus  <cit> , and p. brasiliensis  <cit> . fungi are non-motile eukaryotes that depend on their adhesive properties for selective interaction with host cells  <cit> . adherence molecules are fundamental in pathogen-host interaction; during this event, the fungal cell wall is in continual contact with the host and acts as a sieve and reservoir for molecules such as adhesins  <cit> . the ability of p. brasiliensis to adhere to and invade nonprofessional phagocytes or epithelial cells has been recognized in previous studies  <cit> . some p. brasiliensis adhesins such as gp <dig>  <cit> , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase   <cit> , a  <dig> kda protein  <cit> , and triosephosphate isomerase   <cit>  have been described. evidence for extracellular localization of some glycolytic enzymes lacking secretion signals at cell-wall anchoring motifs has been reported for some pathogens  <cit> . in addition malate synthase  is also described as an adhesin on mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> .

the glyoxylate cycle and its key enzymes isocitrate lyase  and mls play a crucial role in the pathogenicity and virulence of various fungi such as the human pathogens a. fumigatus  <cit> , cryptococcus neoformans  <cit>  and c. albicans  <cit> , the bacterium m. tuberculosis  <cit>  as well as the phytopathogenic fungus magnaporthe grisea  <cit>  and the necrotropic wheat pathogen stagonospora nodorum  <cit> . a relevant role for the glyoxylate cycle in the viability and growth of fungi inside macrophages and, consequently, in the development of a disseminated fungal infection has been postulated  <cit> . icl and mls have also been considered a therapeutic target for the development of novel antifungal compounds, since there are no human orthologues. in p. brasiliensis, the enzyme mls  participates in the glyoxylate pathway, which enables fungus to assimilate two-carbon compounds from the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in the allantoin degradation pathway of the purine metabolism, which allows the fungus to use nitrogen compounds  <cit> .

here it is demonstrated that pbmls is the first fungal mls localized on the cell surface which interferes with the infection process.

RESULTS
expression, purification and production of polyclonal antibody to pbmlsr
the cdna encoding pbmls was subcloned into the expression vector pet-32a to obtain recombinant fusion protein. the protein was not present in crude extracts of non-induced e. coli cells carrying the expression vector . after induction with iptg, a  <dig> kda recombinant protein was detected in bacterial lysates . the six-histidine residues fused to the n terminus of the recombinant protein were used to purify the protein from bacterial lysates by nickel-chelate affinity. the recombinant protein was eluted and analyzed by sds-page  and his-, trx-, and s-tag were removed by cleavage with the enterokinase . an aliquot of the purified recombinant protein was used to generate rabbit polyclonal anti-pbmlsr antibody. western blot confirmed the positive reaction of antibody with the fusion protein  identifying a protein of  <dig> kda. the cleaved recombinant protein was detected as a species of  <dig> kda .

detection of pbmls on cell wall extracts, culture filtrate, crude extract and peroxisomal fraction
to determine the subcellular distribution of pbmls, cell wall-enriched, secreted, and peroxisomal fractions purified from p. brasiliensis yeast cells were obtained. crude extract proteins, sds-extracted cell wall proteins, and extracted cell wall proteins from yeast cells were subjected to sds-page analysis, blotted onto nylon membrane and reacted to polyclonal anti-pbmlsr antibody. pbmls was detected in crude extract , and in sds-extracted cell wall proteins , but was not detected in extracted cell-wall proteins . pbmls activity was evaluated in sds-extracted cell wall and in crude extract, showing specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg and  <dig>  u/mg, respectively. no cross-reactivity to the pre-immune rabbit serum was evidenced with the samples .

to determined whether pbmls was secreted to the medium, proteins were extracted from culture filtrates harvested from p. brasiliensis which had been growing for  <dig> and  <dig> h ,  <dig> days , and  <dig> days . the proteins were subjected to sds-page analysis, blotted onto nylon membrane and reacted to polyclonal anti-pbmlsr antibody. pbmls was detected in all these preparations . no signal was detected in medium free of cells . pbmls activity was evaluated in culture filtrate showing specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg. no cross-reactivity to the pre-immune rabbit serum was evidenced with the samples . altogether, these results suggest that pbmls binds weakly to the cell wall and is actively secreted in p. brasiliensis.

since pbmls has the akl tripeptide, a peroxisomal/glyoxysomal signal which targets pts <dig>  <cit> , the presence of the protein was investigated in this cellular compartment. peroxisomal and mitochondrial fractions purified of p. brasiliensis were obtained. the proteins were subjected to sds-page analysis, blotted onto nylon membrane and reacted to the polyclonal anti-pbmlsr antibody. pbmls was detected in the peroxisomal fraction  confirming the localization of pbmls in this organelle. since pbmls has not been found in mitochondria, the mitochondrial fraction was used as the negative control .

cellular localization of pbmls by confocal microscopy
to observe the cellular location of pbmls, p. brasiliensis yeast cells were grown in rich medium and visualized by laser confocal microscopy. the expression of pbmls was highly positive in the budding cells  but was usually negative  or weakly positive  in the mother cells. although reactivity was evident inside the cytoplasm of budding cells, it was much more intense on the cell surface . the patterns and intensities of the fluorescence spectra of two regions of interest  are shown in figure  <dig> g.

the localization of pbmls was also evaluated on p. brasiliensis yeast cells grown in medium containing acetate or glucose as the sole carbon source. yeast cells accumulated pbmls in the presence of acetate  or glucose , but the quantity of pbmls was higher when the fungus was cultivated in the presence of acetate. this disparity was exemplified by the fluorescence spectra , representative of two rois indicated by arrows  <dig> and  <dig> . no cross reaction was observed with the pre-immune serum .

binding of pbmlsr to extracellular matrix proteins  and the reactivity to sera of pcm patients
the ability of the pbmlsr to bind to ecm proteins was evaluated by far-western blot assays. pbmlsr binds to fibronectin, type i and iv collagen, but not to laminin as shown in fig. 4a, lanes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively). negative controls were obtained incubating pbmlsr with the secondary antibody in the absence of ecm or pbmlsr with ecm only . the reaction between pbmlsr and the antibody anti-pbmlsr was used as a positive control . the binding between pbmls and ecm compounds was also evaluated by elisa assay. the results reinforced that pbmlsr binds to fibronectin, type i and iv collagen . negative controls were performed using pbmlsr  or ecm only . the positive control was performed using anti-pbmlsr, anti-laminin, anti-fibronectin, anti-colagen i or anti-colagen iv antibody .

pbmlsr was reacted with three sera of patients with pcm and one serum from a healthy individual in immunoblot assays . strong reactivity was observed with the pcm-patient sera . no cross-reactivity was observed with control serum . reaction between pbmlsr and anti-pbmlsr was used as positive control .

binding of pbmlsr to pneumocytes
the ability of pbmlsr to bind to a <dig> cells was evaluated. pbmlsr was biotinylated and incubated with a <dig> cells. after lyses, proteins from a <dig> cells were electrophoresed by sds-page and blotted onto a membrane to perform western blot with anti-pbmlsr antibody. a positive signal was detected from lysed pulmonary a <dig> cells treated with biotinylated pbmlsr . the negative control was obtained using supernatant of a <dig> cells untreated with biotinylated protein .

the inhibitory effect of pbmlsr and anti-pbmlsr antibody on the interaction of p. brasiliensis cells with pneumocytes
the infection index was determined by interactions between p. brasiliensis yeast cells and a <dig> pneumocytes, as shown in figure  <dig>  p. brasiliensis yeast cells were treated with the anti-pbmlsr antibody before interaction with pneumocytes or pneumocytes were treated with pbmlsr before interaction with p. brasiliensis. the controls  were used to calculate the percentages of total infection. the interaction was analyzed by flow cytometry. ten thousand events were collected to analysis as monoparametric histograms of log fluorescence and list mode data files. when p. brasiliensis yeast cells treated with anti-pbmlsr antibody were incubated with a <dig> cells, a decrease in infection was observed after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of incubation . similarly, after treatment of a <dig> cells with pbmlsr, infection was reduced after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of incubation when compared to the values for non-treated cells . controls were performed by incubating the pneumocytes with rabbit pre-immune serum or bsa before the addition of a <dig> cells or yeast cells .

discussion
our studies showed that pbmls is a multifunctional protein; besides its enzymatic role as described by zambuzzi-carvalho  <cit> , it could participate in the adherence process between the fungus and host cells through its ability to bind fibronectin, type i and type iv collagen. pbmls was detected in crude extract, cell wall and culture filtrate of p. brasiliensis, which is confirmed by activity assay. taken together, our results suggest that pbmls is actively secreted by p. brasiliensis. in the same way, m. tuberculosis mls has been consistently identified in the culture filtrates of mid-log phase m. tuberculosis cultures  <cit> .

adherence molecules are important in pathogen-host interactions. they operate as intercellular adhesion molecules  or substrate adhesion molecules , contributing to cell-cell or cell-ecm adherences, respectively, and are usually exposed on the cellular surface. successful host tissue colonization by fungus is a complex event, generally involving a ligand  encoded by the pathogen and a cell or ecm receptor. the pathogen could interact with three types of host component: secreted cell products, host cell surface, or ecm proteins, such as types i and iv collagen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and laminin  <cit> . the adhesin potential of pbmls was demonstrated through far-western blot, elisa and binding assays. these showed that the recombinant protein recognized the ecm proteins, fibronectin and types i and iv collagen, as well as pulmonary epithelial cells. this event indicates that pbmls can play a role in the interaction of the fungus with host components. studies have reported the capacity of p. brasiliensis for adhesion and invasion  <cit> . this is the first glyoxylate cycle enzyme identified on the fungal surface and released extracellularly which possesses the ability to bind to ecm proteins. the definition of pbmlsr as a surface-exposed ecm-binding protein, with an unknown mechanism for secretion from the cell or sorting proteins to cellular membrane, suggests that pbmlsr is compatible with anchorless adhesions  <cit> . in these types of adhesions, proteins are reassociated on the cellular surface after being secreted to execute their biological functions  <cit> . the presence of pbmls in the culture filtrate harvested after  <dig> and  <dig> h, and  <dig> and  <dig> days of growth confirmed that it is truly a secreted protein. the presence of pbmls in sds-extracted cell-wall protein fraction indicates that pbmls is associated with the cell surface through weak interactions. taken together these results provide evidence that pbmls may be transported out of the cell through the cell wall to be localized on the outer surface of the cell.

reports have described the presence of some enzymes of the glycolytic pathway on the cell surface in p. brasiliensis as well as in other pathogens  <cit> . the presence of these housekeeping enzymes in unusual locations often correlates with their ability to perform alternative functions such as adherence/invasion of the host cells  <cit> . the ability of anti-adhesin antibodies to confer protection by blocking microbial attachment to host cells is being explored as a vaccination strategy in several microbial diseases  <cit> . the identification of the pbmls as a probable adhesin has several implications. understanding the consequences of the binding of pbmls to host cells will lead to improved understanding of the initial events during infection. further insights into the role of the pbmls in the host-pathogen interaction could contribute to the design of novel therapeutic strategies for pcm control.

although pcm infection starts by inhalation of airborne propagules of the mycelia phase, as conidia, which reach the lungs and differentiates into the yeast phase  <cit> , we performed experiments just with yeast cells since this is the phase found inside the host. is important emphasize that pbmls transcript is also present in the mycelium phase as described  <cit> .

the results of confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated differences in the accumulation of pbmls among p. brasiliensis cells grown in different carbon sources. accumulation of pbmls was also higher in p. brasiliensis yeast cells than in the mycelial phase . these findings were reinforced by the results of felipe et al.  <cit> , which suggested that the glyoxylate cycle is up-regulated in yeast cells  <cit> . yeast cells grown on potassium acetate accumulated more pbmls on the cell membrane than yeast cells grown on glucose. these results are in agreement with those obtained by zambuzzi-carvalho et al.  <cit>  where the pbmls transcript level was higher in yeasts cells grown in a two-carbon source than in cells grown on glucose only. the high intensity of roi found in budding cells, mainly in the cellular membrane, suggests that the pbmls is metabolically relevant and mainly synthesized by young cells . it is unknown whether pbmls plays any part in the differentiation and/or maturity processes of p. brasiliensis budding cells  <cit> . in fact, the glyoxylate pathway provides metabolic versatility for candida albicans to utilize alternate substrata for development and differentiation and is involved in the formation of the filamentous state from the single cell state  <cit> . this process may help laccaria bicolor grow toward the host with the aggressiveness required for mycorrhiza formation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results showed the presence of pbmls in the culture filtrate of yeast cells , its surface location in p. brasiliensis and its binding to ecm in far-western blot and elisa assays and to a <dig> cells membranes. the reduction in the adherence of p. brasiliensis to a <dig> cells by anti-pbmlsr suggests that pbmls could contribute to active fungal interaction and disease progression in humans through its ability to act as a probable adhesin. in addition, the absence of conventional secretion or cell wall anchoring motifs defines pbmls as a probable anchorless adhesin that could contribute to virulence by promoting p. brasiliensis infection and dissemination.
