BACKGROUND
lipolytic enzymes, including esterases or carboxylesterases  and lipases , catalyze the stereospecific hydrolysis, transesterification, and conversion of a variety of amines and primary and secondary alcohols  <cit> . esterases and carboxylesterases hydrolyze partly-soluble fatty acid esters with acyl chain lengths of less than  <dig> carbon atoms  <cit> , whereas lipases act on water-insoluble long-chain triglycerides. many lipases and esterases have been isolated from a variety of microorganisms, animals, plants, and metagenomes  <cit> .

thermostable esterases/lipases originate from thermophiles. their extraordinary thermodynamic stability allows these enzymes to function in organic solvents, and at elevated temperatures that approach or exceed 100°c  <cit> . despite the many biotechnological and industrial applications of thermostable lipolytic enzymes, only less than one dozen of them have been isolated from thermophiles, hyperthermophiles, and metagenomes from thermal environments  <cit> . we recently reported a new hormone-sensitive esterase/lipase  family  <cit>  hyperthermostable esterase, este <dig>  which was isolated by functional screening of a metagenomic dna librariy constructed from a thermal environment sample  <cit> . este <dig> is composed of  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda. it exhibits an esterase activity on short chain acyl derivatives of length c4–c <dig> at temperatures of  <dig> to 90°c, and is stable at temperatures exceeding 90°c  <cit>  the amino acid sequence of este <dig> is significantly similar to other thermostable hsl-family esterases, including an esterase from hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrobaculum calidifontis   <cit> , the esterase afest from hyperthermophilic archaeon archeoglobus fulgidus   <cit> , and the esterase est <dig> from thermophilic bacterium alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius   <cit>  recently, the three-dimensional  structure of este <dig> was predicted by homology modeling using the afest esterase as a reference  <cit> . structure and sequence-based analyses for the thermostability determinants of este <dig> identified multiple intramolecular ion-pair networks and hydrophobic interactions critical for the thermostability of este <dig>  <cit> .

dimers and oligomers are often the functional form of proteins and may have been evolutionarily selected to confer thermostability on the proteins in thermopiles because subunit associations can result in extra stabilization of the proteins. indeed, many enzymes from thermophilic organisms are capable of forming higher order oligomers  <cit> , but only a few have been studied in detail to determine what interfacial interactions are responsible for their thermostability. here we report for the first time the crystal structure of este <dig> at  <dig> -Å resolution. by structural and functional analysis of the thermostability determinants of este <dig>  we found that este <dig> dimerization through hydrophobic interactions is the major contributor for the hyperthermostability of este <dig> 

RESULTS

the final structure of este <dig> displayed a nearly ellipsoidal shape with approximate dimensions of  <dig> Å ×  <dig> Å ×  <dig> Å . it has the classical features of an α/β hydrolase fold  <cit>  consisting of a central eight-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by the five helices α <dig> , α <dig> , α <dig> , α <dig> , and α <dig> . the electron density of the n-terminal  <dig> residues, which is expected to include the α <dig>  helix, was disordered. strands β <dig> and β <dig> – β <dig> are parallel but the β <dig> strand is antiparallel to the others. the β <dig> and β <dig> strands are rotated approximately 90° because β2–β <dig> sheets are in the counter-clockwise direction starting from the position of the β <dig> strand and extending to that of the β <dig> strand. these β strands form an α/β fold core domain, which is the canonical architecture of an α/β hydrolase  <cit> . este <dig> also contains a similar cap domain present in other members of the hsl family  <cit> . the cap domain consists of two separated helical regions  and locates to the upper region of the central β-sheet. the helices α <dig> , α <dig> , α <dig> , α <dig> , two 310-helices , and several random coils between these helices constitute the cap domain.

active site architecture: catalytic triad and substrate-binding pocket
the activity of α/β hydrolases primarily depends on a catalytic triad formed by ser, his, and asp/glu residues  <cit> . the active site of este <dig> also resides in a canonical position  inferred from known structures of α/β hydrolases  <cit> . the key nucleophile ser <dig>  which is found in a highly conserved gly-x-ser-x-gly pentapeptide   <cit> , locates to the apex of the nucleophilic elbow. the nucleophile backbone φ and ψ angles for ser <dig> lie in an unfavorable region of the ramanchandran plot  because of the sharpness of the turn connecting the β <dig> strand and α <dig> helix. a hydrogen bond  between the og atom of ser <dig> and ne <dig> atom of his <dig> stabilizes the conformation of the nucleophile ser <dig>  the proton carrier residues his <dig> and asp <dig> that form the charge-relay network locate to the carboxyl edge of β-strands  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the side-chains of his <dig> and asp <dig> are stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds formed by the nd <dig> atom of his <dig> and the od <dig> atom of asp <dig> , the ne <dig> atom of his <dig> and the og atom of ser <dig> , the od <dig> atom of asp <dig> and the nh atom of leu <dig> , and the o atom of asp <dig> and the n atom of arg <dig> .

the substrate-binding pocket of este <dig> extends approximately  <dig> Å from the protein surface to the catalytic ser <dig> residue. the deep hydrophobic cleft is funnel-shaped and its entrance is surrounded by three α-helices , the 310-helix g <dig> , and the loop regions . the sequence motif his-gly-gly-gly , which is conserved in the hsl family  <cit> , is upstream of the active site. it is involved in hydrogen bonding for stabilization of the oxyanion hole formed by gly <dig>  gly <dig>  and ala <dig>  residue gly <dig> is fixed by hydrogen bonds between its amino group and the od <dig> atom of asp <dig> , and between the carbonyl group of gly <dig> and the nd <dig> atom of his <dig> .

hydrophobic interactions essential for the dimerization of este1
este <dig> exists as a dimer in solution. an este <dig> dimer has 2-fold crystallographic symmetry and displays an extensive dimeric interface spanning over  <dig> Å <dig> . assuming two molecules comprise an asymmetric unit, the matthews coefficient vm was calculated to be  <dig>  Å3/da, which corresponds to a solvent content of  <dig> %. este <dig> dimerization is primarily mediated by hydrophobic interactions in the middle of the interface and is assisted by salt bridges at both ends of the interface . the dimeric interface is characterized by the formation of β-sheet between the two monomers by an antiparallel association between two c-terminal β <dig> strands. we identified two salt bridges, lys <dig> -glu <dig>  and arg <dig> -asp <dig>  . these interactions exhibit centrosymmetric configuration toward the center of the interface. we also identified hydrophobic interactions between val <dig> , phe <dig> , and leu <dig>  .

the residues responsible for dimerization of este <dig> subunits differ from those of afest. a previous study showed that intermolecular contacts present in afest consisted of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges  <cit> . amino acid sequence alignment revealed that val <dig>  phe <dig>  and leu <dig> of este <dig> correspond to val <dig>  tyr <dig>  and gln <dig> of afest, respectively , but these residues in afest did not participate in similar hydrophobic interactions as observed in este <dig>  instead, hydrogen bonds between tyr280a-gln303b and tyr280b-gln303a, and weak hydrophobic interactions between val278a and val278b, appear to contribute to the intermolecular interactions observed in afest . to verify the roles of the hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges identified in este <dig> dimer interface, eight este <dig> mutant proteins containing single or multiple amino acid substitutions were created. five este <dig> mutants had disruptions in hydrophobic interactions. val <dig> was replaced with ala to generate este1v274a. phe <dig> was replaced with ala and glu to generate este1f276a and este1f276e, respectively. leu <dig> was changed to asp in este1l299d. both phe <dig> and val <dig> were changed to ala in este1v274a/f276a. in addition, three este <dig> mutants containing changes in the residues involved in the salt bridges were generated. arg <dig> and glu <dig> residues were replaced with ala to generate este1r270a and este1e295a, respectively. both of these amino acids were changed to ala to generate este1r270a/e295a. all of these mutants were expressed in e. coli and purified to near-homogeneity from cell extracts that were not heat-treated, using ni-affinity chromatography as described previously  <cit> . analysis of the molecular weight of the purified mutant proteins by gel filtration chromatography  revealed that este1f276e and este1v274a/f276a converted to a monomer of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively, while wild-type este <dig> and other mutants were the size of a dimer with a molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda . este1f276a remained as a dimer whereas a single mutation of phe to glu in este1f276e completely abolished dimerization. this is likely due to the fact that ala has a similar hydrophobicity scale as that of phe such that este <dig> molecules maintained their hydrophobic interactions, while change of the phe to hydrophilic residue glu did not permit the formation of hydrophobic interactions with val <dig> in another molecule of este <dig>  this result underscores the critical role of hydrophobic interactions through phe <dig>  in addition, even though a single amino acid change in este1v274a and este1f276a did not convert them to monomers, the combination of these two mutations in este1v274a/f276a abolished its ability to form dimers, suggesting the hydrophobic interactions involving both val <dig> and phe <dig> are important for este <dig> dimerization. likewise, native page analysis revealed a faster electrophoretic mobility of este1f276e and este1v274a/f276a compared to that of wild-type este <dig> . in contrast, the este <dig> mutant proteins with ala substitution of arg <dig> or asp <dig> , and the mutant with ala substitution on both of these residues  were still able to dimerize, indicating salt bridges at the both ends of the hydrophobic interface are not critical for este <dig> dimerization.

the relationship between the dimerization and thermostability of este1
to investigate the relationship between the dimerization and thermostability of este <dig>  we compared the thermostability of the este <dig> mutant proteins by thermal denaturation experiments using cd spectroscopy. cd spectra of all este <dig> mutants in the far-uv region at 20°c were very similar to that of wild-type este <dig> , confirming that the integrity of secondary structure of the mutant proteins was not affected by the introduction of mutations. we then determined the apparent transition temperature   <cit>  by monitoring changes in secondary structure content in the temperature range of  <dig> to 110°c . as shown in fig. 5c, the tapp value for este1f276e and este1v274a/f276a, which converted to monomers , showed an approximate 20°c decrease in tapp. this demonstrates that both phe <dig> and val <dig>  which are important for intermolecular hydrophobic interactions, are critical for thermostability of este <dig>  in contrast, mutations of the residues involved in interfacial salt bridges did not significantly decrease the tapp value. the tapp values for the este1r270a, este1e295a, este1r270a/e295a, and este1y250f were estimated to be  <dig> ,  <dig> °c,  <dig>  and  <dig> °c, respectively. none of these mutants lost their ability to form dimers , suggesting that hydrophobic interactions responsible for este <dig> dimerization are the main contributors to the thermostability of este <dig> 

kinetic analyses of the thermal stability of wild-type and mutant este <dig> proteins also support the notion that the thermostability of este <dig> correlates with its ability to form a dimer . by mutating the sites involved in the hydrophobic interaction between two molecules of este <dig>  este1f276e and este1v274a/f276a dramatically lost their enzyme activities after incubation for  <dig> h at 80°c. the estimated half-life values of este1f276e and este1v274a/f276a were  <dig>  and  <dig> min, respectively. in contrast, wild-type este <dig> showed no significant decrease in activity even after incubation for  <dig> h. este1f276a, which did not exist in a monomeric form, lost approximately 50% of its activity after incubation for  <dig> h at 80°c, suggesting that weaker hydrophobic interactions can be disrupted during heat denaturation. this result is consistent with the thermal denaturation pattern of este1f276a, displaying an earlier denaturation profile compared to wild-type este <dig> . este1l299d appeared as a dimer  and retained a high thermostability, indicating that leu <dig> is not detrimental for este <dig> dimerization and thermostability. introduction of mutations to the residues involved in salt bridges at the este <dig> dimer interface did not induce conversion of este <dig> dimer to a monomer form . este1r270a and este1r270a/e295a displayed a slight decrease in their thermostability , and este1e295a still maintained its activity . these results suggest that salt bridges are not the major contributor required for este <dig> dimerization and thermostability, whereas two hydrophobic interfacial spots, val <dig> and phe <dig> on the β <dig> strand of two molecules of este <dig>  are critical for este <dig> dimerization and thermostability.

discussion
we determined the crystal structure of este <dig> at  <dig> -Å resolution by the sad method. este <dig> has a characteristic α/β hydrolase fold with nine alpha helices and an eight-stranded β-sheet. the residues ser <dig>  asp <dig>  and his <dig> of the catalytic triad are found in the canonical positions observed in a wide variety of α/β hydrolases  <cit> . four members of the hsl family have been structurally characterized. they include an esterase from the mesophilic bacterium alcaligenes eutrophus  <cit> , the bfae from the mesophilic bacterium bacillus subtilis  <cit> , and two thermophilic esterases, the est <dig> from the thermophilic bacterium alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius  <cit> , and the afest from the hyperthermophilic archaeon archaeoglobus fulgidus  <cit> . este <dig> is closer in structure to hsl-family thermostable esterases afest  code 1jji;  <dig> cα atoms superimposed, root-mean-square deviation  of  <dig>  Å) and est <dig>  than to mesophilic esterases, an esterase from alcaligenes eutrophus  and bfae .

este <dig> exists as a dimer through hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges . the thermostable esterase afest, which is most closely related with este <dig> both in structure and amino acid sequence, also was known to exist as dimers, and the intermolecular contacts of afest primarily consist of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges  <cit> . our comparison of the structures of este <dig> and afest revealed that, although β-sheets of the core domain of these thermostable esterases are almost identically arranged, the overall content of secondary structure elements in este <dig> and afest show slightly different configurations. este <dig> consists of  <dig> % helical and  <dig> % β-strand conformations, while afest has  <dig> % helical and  <dig> % β-strand conformations  <cit> . this suggests that este <dig> has more turns and loops that might result in decreased thermostability of este <dig> because, in the order of mesophilic/thermophilic/hyperthermophilic proteins, gradually reduced dimensions in the loop regions are likely to presented  <cit> . nevertheless, este <dig> displays a higher thermostability compared to afest. afest had approximately 50% residual activity after incubation for  <dig> min at 95°c with a half life of  <dig> min, whereas este <dig> still displayed > 95% residual activity under the same conditions  <cit> . this hyperthermostability of este <dig> is most likely due to strong hydrophobic interactions at the dimeric interface. alignment of the amino acid sequences of este <dig> and afest revealed that the residues playing a key role in este <dig> dimerization differ from those of afest . the hydrophobic residues val <dig>  phe <dig>  and leu <dig>  which are involved in este <dig> dimerization, correspond to val <dig>  tyr <dig>  and gln <dig> of afest, respectively. unlike este <dig>  afest cannot form strong hydrophobic interactions through these residues. afest dimers appear to be formed by hydrogen bonds  and weak hydrophobic interactions between val278a and val278b.

because hydrophobic effect is considered to be a key feature that leads proteins to fold into its functional configuration  <cit> , it also is assumed to be the major force involved in protein thermostabilization in thermal environments  <cit> . kinetic analyses of the thermal stability of wild-type and mutant este <dig> proteins revealed that the elevated thermostability of este <dig> correlates with its ability to form dimers . the activity of este1f276e and este1v274a/f276a, which are present as a monomer, was dramatically diminished when they were incubated at 80°c. although este <dig> retained its dimeric status upon mutation of either val <dig> or phe <dig> to ala , mutation of both of these amino acids to ala  destabilized the este <dig> and converted it to a monomer in solution. these results suggest that the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions through val <dig> and phe <dig> between two molecules of este <dig> largely contribute to the thermostability of este <dig>  mutation of either val <dig> or phe <dig> to ala rendered the mutant proteins more sensitive to heat denaturation, with the latter mutation being more effective in destabilizing este <dig> dimers during the course of heat denaturation  and thermostability kinetic analysis . our analysis of the β-sheet stability index   <cit>  predicted the extent to which val <dig> and phe <dig> in β-strand  <dig> contributed to the stability of the intermolecular β-sheet bridges. the results showed that the mean curvature of phe <dig>  was smaller than that of val <dig> , suggesting that alteration of the more stable residue phe <dig> on the β-strand could result in destabilization of este <dig> dimers by altering the β-strand conformation. previously, mesophilic bfae also was shown to form a dimer by a network of hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions  <cit> , but detailed information was not provided. our analysis of the dimeric interface of bfae revealed that its dimerization is mediated mainly by the ionic interactions between side chains of each subunit , and by the main chain-main chain hydrogen bonds at the dimeric interface . alignment of bafe and este <dig> amino acid sequences shows that the hydrophobic residues val <dig>  phe <dig>  and leu <dig> in este <dig> were substituted with the hydrophilic residues, arg <dig>  asn <dig>  and arg <dig> in bfae, respectively . bfae exists as a dimeric form in solution  <cit> , like este <dig>  but the dimer interactions are quite distinct in that este <dig> dimer has tight hydrophobic interactions assisted by ionic interactions, while bfae dimerization is mainly mediated by ionic interactions. therefore, thermostability of este <dig> is probably explained by hydrophobic interaction-mediated dimerization not observed in one of its homologous mesophilic esterases, bfae.

in our previous work, we compared the sequence and structure of esterases from thermophiles with that of their mesophilic counterparts to demonstrate that changes in the size or packing state of hydrophobic clusters in the cavity of este <dig> affect its thermostability. likewise, we also identified ion-pair networks consisting of arg <dig>  arg <dig>  and arg <dig>  that contribute to the stabilization of este <dig> in thermal environments  <cit> . mutation of ala <dig>  which is located in the hydrophobic cavity of este <dig>  to gly in este1a75g more effectively decreased the thermostability than other mutations of residues involved in intramolecular ion-pair network formation  <cit> . este1a75g, however, still exhibited ~75% residual activity after incubation for  <dig> min at 95°c  <cit> , while mutation of val <dig> and phe <dig>  which were identified in this work as the residues most critical for este <dig> thermostability, resulted in no detectable level of activity and ~25% residual activity, respectively, after incubation for  <dig> min at 80°c . together, these results underscore the importance of hydrophobic interactions-mediated dimerization in the hyperthermostability of este <dig>  a recent analysis of structures and sequences of several hyperthermostable proteins proposed two possible mechanisms for thermostabilization of proteins, "structure-based" and "sequence-based" mechanisms of thermostability, which possibly explain an evolutionary strategy of thermophilic adaptation of proteins  <cit> . the authors found that hyperthermophilic archaea possibly used structure-based mechanisms to increase the thermostability of their proteins, and that the proteins were "de novo"-designed to be more compact than their mesophilic counterparts. indeed, este <dig> has a relatively higher number of van der walls contacts per residue  compared to the mesophilic bfae . thus, compactness of este <dig> structure provides a plausible explanation for its hyperthermostability. thermostability determinants of este <dig> identified in this study and in our previous work  <cit>  altogether suggest that este <dig> might be originated from a hyperthermophilic archaeon because its thermostability mainly relies on the "structure-based' mechanism as described above. our experiments-based prediction of the origin of este <dig> is consistent with the previous data showing that este <dig> is more closely related to hyperthermophilic archaea-originated hsl-family esterases/lipases, as demonstrated by phylogenetic tree analysis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our structural analysis of the este <dig> dimer structure identified hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges that contributed to the formation of este <dig> dimers. site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that hydrophobic interactions through val <dig> and phe <dig> on the β <dig> strand at dimer interface contribute to the formation of este <dig> dimers and their hyperthermostability. our data along with the previous ones  <cit>  suggest that the hyperthermostability of este <dig> is likely the result of a delicate balance between several factors including ion-pair networks and hydrophobic interactions. nevertheless, the hyperthermostability of este <dig> seems to be achieved mainly by its dimerization through hydrophobic interactions, rather than intermolecular and intramolecular ion-pair networks even though they additively contribute to further stabilization of este <dig>  este <dig> therefore might be evolutionally adapted to thermal environment by its intrinsic structural ability to form compact and stable dimers  <cit> .
