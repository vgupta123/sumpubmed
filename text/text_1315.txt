BACKGROUND
effective functioning of cellular systems requires optimal expression of individual proteins  <cit> . on the other hand, cellular systems are generally robust against changes in protein expression  <cit> . identifying permissible limits of intracellular parameters such as protein expression provides important information for examining robustness  <cit> .

we previously developed a method designated genetic tug-of-war , by which we can measure the limit of overexpression of a target protein  <cit> . in gtow, we clone a target gene with its native promoter into a 2 μ-based plasmid harboring leu2d. under leucine-lacking  conditions, the copy number of the plasmid reaches > <dig> copies because of the selection bias driven by leu2d. if the target protein expression reaches the upper limit, i.e., essential cellular functions come to a halt when the level of protein exceeds a certain limit, the gene/plasmid copy number must decrease to below the upper limit. in gtow, we thus increase the expression of a protein to a limit by increasing the copy number and then determine the upper limit by measuring the corresponding copy number of the gene. using gtow, we previously measured the copy number limits for overexpression of  <dig> cell cycle regulatory genes in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and studied the robustness of the cell cycle and mechanisms that can improve the robustness of the cell cycle  <cit> . we recently measured the copy number limits of all yeast genes and showed that the yeast cellular system is robust against >100-fold increase in the copy numbers of each of >80% genes  <cit> . in that analysis, we also identified  <dig> “dosage-sensitive genes” whose copy number limits were < <dig>  <cit> .

while gtow is a method to measure the upper limit of protein expression, determination of the lower limit is still a question. the commonly used gene-deletion experiments reduce the expression of a target protein to  <dig>  gene-deletion experiments for all genes in s. cerevisiae have revealed that about 20% genes are essential for cellular growth under normal conditions  <cit> ; other genes are essential for cellular growth under specific conditions such as specific environmental conditions or in combination with other gene knockouts  <cit> . each of these proteins must have a minimal requirement level  to support cellular growth under each of these conditions. at present, there is no effective method to assess the lower expression limit of a target protein.

to assess the lower limit, we have to gradually reduce the expression of a protein and then measure the lower limit by some methods. to reduce the expression of a gene/protein, we need to reduce the production rate of the transcript, increase the degradation rate of the transcript, decrease the production rate of the protein, or increase the degradation rate of the protein. to identify the lower limit of expression, we would need to specifically decrease/increase the production/degradation rate of the target and evaluate the limit that would halt cellular function. experimental methods that could potentially be used for this purpose in s. cerevisiae are as follows:  decreasing the expression rate of the transcript using a repressible promoter  <cit> ,  decreasing the transcription rate or increasing the degradation rate using rna interference   <cit> ,  increasing the degradation of mrna by the decreased abundance by mrna perturbation  method  <cit> ,  increasing the rate of degradation of the transcript by recruiting the rna-degrading enzyme to the 3′ region of the transcript  <cit> ,  increasing the rate of degradation of the protein using inducible degrons  <cit> ,  increasing the rate of degradation of the protein using the tev protease-mediated induction of protein instability  method  <cit> .

in this study, we used tipi in combination with gtow to develop a method to measure the lower limit of protein expression. in tipi, a target protein is expressed with a tev protease-induced degron, an n-terminal sequence containing a cleavage site for the site-specific tev protease. cleavage of the protein at this site by the tev protease triggers the exposure of the “n-degron”  <cit> , which triggers the rapid degradation of the target protein through the n-end rule pathway. we chose tipi because, theoretically, we can increase the degradation rate of the target protein by increasing the expression of tev protease using the gtow scheme with a plasmid encoding tev. we can then evaluate the lower limit of the target protein expression by measuring the copy number of the tev plasmid. we first tested the feasibility of this method using ade <dig> as a marker and then analyzed some cell cycle regulators to reveal genetic interactions.

RESULTS
establishment of tipi-gtow using ade <dig> as a marker
in the gtow method, we cloned the target gene into a plasmid and increased the copy number using the genetic bias for leu2d <cit> . in this study, by increasing the copy number of the gene encoding tev protease using the gtow scheme, we attempted to increase the degradation rate of a target protein containing a tev protease-induced degron . if the target protein expression is at the lower limit for any essential cellular function, the degradation rate must be less than that required to maintain the lower limit, which will restrict the upper limit copy number of the gene encoding tev. we designated this scheme tipi-gtow.

to ensure the success of this approach, we need to adjust the expression of the following:  the target protein  to be in the range required to support the growth of the cell  and  the tev protease to be in the appropriate range to induce degradation in order to detect the lower limit of the target protein expression. taxis et al. used the cyc <dig> promoter and adh <dig> promoter to express target proteins and the gal <dig> promoter to induce tev protease expression  <cit> . in some cases, they could not observe expected lethal phenotypes, probably because the induced degradation of the target proteins by the tev protease was insufficient to reduce the protein expression to their lower limits  <cit> .

we used constitutive promoters to increase the expression of tev protease in accordance with the increase in gene copy number. we first used the s. cerevisiae tef <dig> promoter to express tev protease, but the strong expression of tev protease from the tef <dig> promoter on the high-copy gtow plasmid in itself caused a cellular growth defect . we currently do no know what causes this toxicity. we then used the cup <dig> promoter. in the culture conditions we used , the cup <dig> mrna level was about 10% of the tef <dig> mrna level . expression of the tev protease from the cup <dig> promoter did not show any cellular growth defect, even when the gene copy number exceeded  <dig> . we used an efficient version of the p14–tev fusion protein   <cit> ; here, we designated this “ptev+.” we also designated the gtow plasmid encoding the ptev+ expressed from the cup <dig> promoter as the “tev plasmid.”

to test the feasibility of tipi-gtow, we selected ade <dig> as a target. ade <dig> encode phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase, an enzyme involved in the adenine synthesis. reduction of ade <dig> protein can be indirectly monitored by assessing cellular growth defect and by accumulation of red pigment in the absence of adenine  <cit> . we integrated ade <dig> with the tev-induced degron expressed from the cdc <dig> promoter into the chromosomal ade <dig> locus . we chose the tdegf degron because it is one of the strongest degrons  <cit> . we then introduced the tev plasmid into the cell. the results of tipi-gtow experiments of ade <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  cellular growth deficiency and red colony formation were observed for cells containing the tev plasmid in the -leu-ade condition . we note that colonies are expected to be redder on sc–ura–leu plates than the ones on sc–ura plates, but they were not . we currently do not know the reason. unknown interaction between the leucine deficiency and the red color formation might exist. we next measured the copy numbers of the tev plasmid and found that the copy number limit of the tev plasmid decreased significantly under the -leu-ade condition . we thus ensured that the ade <dig> protein was expressed at the lower limit and indirectly estimated the lower limit from the tev plasmid copy number. we note that the copy numbers of the vector were significantly different in between –ura–leu and –ura–leu–ade conditions . the replication and/or partition of the 2 μ-based plasmid might be affected by the growth conditions.

tipi-gtow experiments of cell cycle regulators
we next selected  <dig> essential cell cycle regulators as target genes to test if tipi-gtow was a feasible approach to assess their lower limits. we constructed the gfp-tdegf constructs for cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  and cdc <dig> and integrated these into their chromosomal loci. at first, we used the full-length cdc <dig> promoter  to express the cell cycle proteins but could not obtain a cdc <dig> construct, probably because strong expression of cdc <dig> is toxic  <cit> . we then constructed a series of deletions of the cdc <dig> promoter to reduce its expression . the gfp expression from promoters with a length of 500 bp or less was markedly lower than that from promoters exceeding 500 bp . this reduction might be due to the deletion of a tye <dig> binding site located at -523 bp to -516 bp . we thus used the full-length cdc <dig> promoter , the cdc19
-600
 promoter , and the cdc19
-500
 promoter  to construct the gfp-tdegf target.

the results of the constructions are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  gfp-
tdegf
cdc <dig> constructs with all  <dig> promoters were obtained. we observed reduction in the copy number of the tev plasmid with the cdc19
-500
 promoter construct, but this was not significant . the lower limit of cdc <dig> may be lower than that produced by tipi-gtow. as described above, we could not obtain a gfp-
tdegf
cdc <dig> construct with the full-length cdc <dig> promoter or the cdc19
-600
 promoter probably because the expression was too high. however, we obtained a gfp-
tdegf
cdc <dig> integrated strain with the cdc19
-500
 promoter. with this strain, we succeeded to detect significant restriction of the copy numbers of the tev plasmid under both -ura and -ura-leu conditions . we obtained gfp-
tdegf
cdc <dig> integrated strains with all the  <dig> promoters and observed significant restrictions of the copy number of the tev plasmid with the cdc19
-600
 promoter under the - ura - leu condition . we did obtain a gfp-
tdegf
cdc <dig> integrated strain with the cdc19
-500
 promoter but could not obtain any transformants with the tev plasmid, probably because the expression of cdc <dig> from the cdc19
-500
 promoter was already close to the lower limit of cdc <dig>  even in the absence of tev protease.

reduction in the protein expression of gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> by tev protease was confirmed by western blotting with anti-gfp antibody . the gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> protein expressed from the cdc19
-500
 promoter seemed to be too low to be detected by western blotting . simultaneously, we could not detect any gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> protein expressed from the cdc19- <dig> promoter .

we further analyzed the tev protease dependent cleavage and reduction of gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> by western blotting with anti-cdc <dig> antibody . the protein levels of gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> in ysm <dig>  were highly reduced in the presence of the tev plasmid compared with the vector control, and the level was lower under the –ura–leu condition, where the expression of ptev+ increased, than the –ura condition. cleaved products  were also observed in the presence of the tev plasmid. the summed levels of the gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> and degfcdc <dig> were comparable with the cdc <dig> levels expressed in by <dig> . these results confirmed that the target protein level was actually reduced using tipi-gtow. we also tired to detect cdc <dig> by western blotting using anti-cdc <dig> antibodies . however, we could not detect any signal, probably because the expression level of cdc <dig> is too low to detect with these antibodies.

estimation of changes in the lower limit of cdc <dig> in gene-deletion strains
as described above, we identified conditions under which the gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> expression was reduced to the lower limit. we next tried to estimate the lower limits of gfp-tdegcdc <dig> in gene-deletion strains using tipi-gtow. we integrated the p_cdc19
-500
-gfp-
tdegf
cdc <dig> construct into the chromosomal cdc <dig> locus of each of  <dig> cell cycle regulator deletion strains and measured the tev plasmid copy number. the copy number data is shown in table  <dig>  we first noticed that the copy numbers of the vector itself varied among deletion strains. this may be because of differences in the growth rate or the efficiency of replication and partitioning of the plasmid among the deletion strains.

*average and sd of four independent experimental trials are shown.

in addition, we observed significant correlations in the copy numbers of the vector and the tev plasmid under both -ura  and -ura-leu  conditions . we thus considered that it was not appropriate to simply estimate the lower limit of gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> from the copy number of the tev plasmid in each deletion strain. therefore, we calculated the ratio of the copy number of the tev plasmid to that of the vector in each deletion strain and compared the ratio with that of the wild type to estimate the relative change in tev plasmid copy number .

figure 4a and table  <dig> show the relative copy number change in each deletion strain. some strains, such as cln1∆, sic1∆, and cdh1∆, had negative relative copy number change values, which indicated that the copy numbers of the tev plasmids in these strains were lower than those in the wild type, indicating that the lower limits of gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> increased in these strains. this implies that the deleted genes are involved in the production or activation of cdc <dig> or have functions overlapping those of cdc <dig> . in these cases, the genes could be synthetically lethal with cdc <dig> mutants or multicopy suppressors of cdc <dig> mutants.

other strains, such as mad2∆, cin8∆, and mbp1∆, showed positive relative copy number change values, indicating that the copy numbers of the tev plasmids were higher than those in the wild type; thus, the lower limits of gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> decreased in these strains. these deleted genes are therefore involved in inhibition of cdc <dig>  e.g., by inhibition of cdc <dig> production or cdc <dig> activity or degradation of cdc <dig> . these genes could be dosage suppressors of the toxicity of cdc <dig> overexpression.

previous studies, including systematic analyses, identified genes showing genetic interactions with cdc <dig> <cit> ; these were listed in the saccharomyces genome database . from these interactions, we summarized relevant genetic interactions studied here in table  <dig> and figure 4a. importantly, the relative copy number of the tev plasmid decreased in deletion strains involving genes showing synthetic lethality or dosage rescue of the cdc <dig> mutant, whereas the relative copy number of the tev plasmid increased in deletion strains involving genes showing synthetic rescue, phenotypic suppression, and dosage lethality of the cdc <dig> mutant. this result indicated that our tipi-gtow approach gave information regarding genetic interactions, which was highly consistent with the previously identified interactions. moreover, the advantage of our approach is that we could isolate genetic interactions in both directions, namely negative interactions such as synthetic lethal and dosage rescue and positive interactions such as synthetic rescue, phenotypic suppression, and dosage lethality in a single experiment.

among genetic interactions obtained in this study, the difference between cln <dig> and cln <dig> was surprising because they are known to have heavily overlapped functions  <cit> . previous analysis, however, showed that clb <dig> has opposite genetic interactions with cln <dig> and cln <dig> <cit> . our results might indicate that these genes have different functions in some contexts.

comparison of experimental data with predictions of a simulation model is useful for evaluating the predictive ability of the mathematical model and for speculating about molecular mechanisms generating negative/positive genetic interactions  <cit> . an integrative mathematical model of the budding yeast cell cycle was developed previously  <cit> , and we have modified this model using gtow data  <cit> . using the “stabilization model” published in the reference  <cit> , we here measured how much the degradation parameter of cdc <dig> could be increased  in each of the gene-deletion models and compared the upper limit of kd <dig> with that in the wild type to obtain the relative change in the upper limit of kd <dig> . this analysis is considered to represent the process of tipi-gtow, namely indirectly assessing the lower limits of cdc <dig> in the presence of gene deletions, by measuring how much degradation can increase without halting the cell cycle. the simulation result is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  figure 4b shows the comparison of the results of tipi-gtow and those of the simulation. deletion strains, such as mad2Δ, cdh1Δ, and others, showed good agreements between tipi-gtow and simulation data; however, some genes such as sic1Δ, swi5Δ, and mbp1Δ showed almost opposite changes, suggesting absence of some regulatory steps in the model.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we tried to develop a method for estimating the lower limit of protein expression by combining the tipi and gtow methods. using tipi-gtow, we successfully constructed a strain in which gfp-tdegfade <dig> was expressed at the lower limit, just sufficient to support cellular growth under the -ade condition by accelerating degradation by tev protease.

we also succeeded in constructing a strain in which the minimal level of gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> was expressed by tipi-gtow. using this strain, we studied genetic interactions between cell cycle regulators and cdc <dig>  we concluded that tipi-gtow is useful for estimating changes in the lower limit of a protein under different conditions, such as different genetic backgrounds and environments. tipi-gtow is useful for analyzing genetic interactions of essential genes whose deletion mutants cannot be obtained. one important characteristic of tipi-gtow is that it is useful for identifying both negative and positive genetic interactions, as shown in figure  <dig>  the synthetic genetic array is a potent high-throughput approach to identifying genetic interactions  <cit> , which now allows quantitative analyses  <cit>  and can also applied to essential genes  <cit> . tipi-gtow developed in this study may be an alternative method to study genetic interactions in detail.

the conventional gtow method developed previously uses a gene with a native promoter and terminator as a unit to increase protein expression and measures the copy number limit to estimate the “copy number limit for protein overexpression”  <cit> . the advantage of gtow is that we can indirectly estimate by how much a target protein can be overexpressed over the native level by simply measuring the copy number of the gtow plasmid. in tipi-gtow, however, we first have to modify the native copy of the target gene, which changes the native expression, activity, and stability of the target protein. in addition, the aim of the procedure is to reduce the expression of the target protein, which makes it difficult to quantitate the lower limit of the target protein by western blotting when this level is under the detection limit. in fact, we have failed to detect the protein levels of ade <dig> and cdc <dig> by western blotting using their specific antibodies . we thus believe that tipi-gtow is a method by which a cellular condition can be constructed with the target protein expressed at the lower limit still supporting cellular function. thus, it is useful for identifying genetic interactions as described above, although it does not measure the absolute lower limit of the target protein.

to use tipi-gtow, the optimal expression for the target gfp-tdegf protein must be determined so that the level is within the range of detection of the lower limit by increasing the tev plasmid. taxis and knop developed a series of tdeg constructs with different promoters and n-degrons of various strengths  <cit> , which will be useful to systematically determine the optimal expression.

previous studies on haploinsufficiency and dosage compensation suggested that most of yeast proteins are expressed at least twice more than the levels required in diploid cells  <cit> . if we could detect the lower limit protein levels under the tipi-gtow experiments, we might be able to argue about this issue. we failed to detect some proteins using western blotting with specific antibodies as described above. fusing the target proteins with more sensitive proves might be useful.
