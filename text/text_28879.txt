BACKGROUND
the pathogenic spirochetes borrelia burgdorferi, b. garinii, and b. afzelii are the etiologic agents of lyme disease  <cit> . although b. burgdorferi possesses both a cytoplasmic and outer membrane  similar to gram-negative bacteria, its om differs significantly from the typical gram-negative om in that it lacks the immunogenic glycolipid lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . instead, the borrelial om contains an abundant number of outer surface lipoproteins, which have been designated osps  <cit> . the osps are soluble proteins that are anchored to the bacterial surface by their lipid moiety  <cit> . in addition to the numerous osps, the borrelial om also contains integral outer membrane proteins  that contain membrane-spanning domains composed of antiparallel, amphipathic β-strands  <cit> . presently, only ten omps have been identified in b. burgdorferi  <cit> . however, freeze-fracture electron microscopy studies have revealed that there are numerous omps present in the borrelial om  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that the ten known omps only represent a small subset and many have likely not yet been identified. identification and characterization of novel omps from b. burgdorferi has become an important goal in the field because they may represent novel vaccine candidates.

exactly how omps are folded and inserted into the om of bacteria is an active area of research  <cit> . while it has been shown that bacterial omps  can spontaneously fold into their native conformation and incorporate into synthetic lipid bilayers and/or detergent micelles in vitro  <cit> , recent studies have revealed that the lipid composition of bacterial oms does not readily allow for spontaneous insertion of most omps  <cit> . to overcome this kinetic barrier of insertion in vivo, bacteria require the β-barrel assembly machine  complex  <cit> . the bam complex is composed of an essential bama protein and one or more accessory proteins  <cit> . bama is an omp itself that contains an n-terminal periplasmic region with five polypeptide transport-associated  domains. potra domains are all composed of a highly similar β-α-α-β-β structural motif  <cit>  and are important for the interaction between bama and bam accessory lipoproteins  <cit> . in e. coli, there are four bam complex accessory lipoproteins: bamb, c, d, and e. bamb and bamd specifically interact with the bama potra domains, while bamc and bame associate with the larger complex by interacting with bamd  <cit> . all bam complexes characterized to date have been shown to be essential for bacterial survival  <cit>  due to the critical role they play in om biogenesis and omp transport  <cit> .

while all bam complexes contain a bama protein, the accessory lipoproteins can vary greatly in number and overall sequence among different bacterial groups  <cit> . for instance, most β- and γ-proteobacteria typically possess four accessory proteins: bamb, c, d, and e  <cit> . in contrast, only bamd orthologs have been identified thus far in the δ- and ε-proteobacteria  <cit> . we previously reported that the bam complex in b. burgdorferi is comprised of a bama ortholog and two putative lipoproteins designated bb <dig> and bb <dig>  with bb <dig> being suggested to be a bamd ortholog  <cit> . to further these prior analyses, we have used structural studies, functional assays, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments to generate a refined topological model of the b. burgdorferi bama protein and to examine the roles of bb <dig> and bb <dig> in the borrelial bam complex. the combined studies revealed that bb <dig> and bb <dig> play a role in membrane integrity and/or omp localization, which is consistent with bb <dig> and bb <dig> being bamb and bamd orthologs, respectively. a working model is proposed for the borrelial bam complex that can now be used to further explore om biogenesis and omp transport in this pathogenic spirochete.

RESULTS
structural model of the b. burgdorferi bama protein
the b. burgdorferi β-barrel assembly machine  complex appears to be comprised of three proteins: the integral outer membrane protein  bama and two accessory lipoproteins designated bb <dig> and bamd/bb <dig>  <cit> . while there is little information regarding the structure or function of the borrelial accessory lipoproteins, the bama protein was previously examined using two different structural modeling algorithms to predict the topology of the membrane-spanning c-terminal domain and the conformation of the n-terminal periplasmic region  <cit> . the recently determined crystal structure of n. gonorrhoeae bama  <cit> , however, provided a known template to refine the structural prediction of the borrelial bama protein using the i-tasser protein structure prediction algorithm  <cit> . as shown in figure 1a, the model predicted for b. burgdorferi bama was observed to be highly similar to n. gonorrhoeae bama, and the confidence score  for the predicted model was  <dig> . the c-score is the most pertinent score for assessing model quality and can range from − <dig> to + <dig>  with scores > − <dig>  considered to accurately indicate the final secondary structure conformation  <cit> . the i-tasser server also provides a template modeling score  to assess the overall structural similarity between the predicted model and the known template structure . the tm-score for the borrelial bama model was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . combined, the c-score and tm-score indicate that the newly-refined model generated for b. burgdorferi bama is of high quality.figure  <dig>

the modeled structure depicted in figure 1a  indicates that b. burgdorferi bama consists of a n-terminal periplasmic domain containing five polypeptide transport-associated  motifs followed by a β-barrel domain with  <dig> membrane-spanning β-strands. a conserved α-helical region was identified in extracellular loop four, which has also been noted in all bama structures characterized to date  <cit> . additionally, loop six contains an arginine-glycine-tryptophan triad that may correspond to the rgf motif found in the same loop of other bama proteins, which has been shown to be essential for bama function  <cit>  . to further examine the reliability of the model generated, we next inserted a c-myc tag into predicted extracellular loop three . as shown in figure 1c, surface immunofluorescence assays using c-myc-specific antibodies verified that the c-myc tag, as predicted, was located on the borrelial surface, which is entirely consistent with the structural model predicted by i-tasser. as expected, the wildtype strain lacking a c-myc tag displayed no reactivity with the c-myc antibodies. to ensure that the fragile outer membrane of b. burgdorferi was not disrupted, antibodies specific for the periplasmic flab protein were also included in the surface localization experiments. when anti-flab antibodies were co-incubated with the anti-cmyc antibodies, no flab was identified, indicating that the outer membranes were intact . the dna-binding dye dapi was also included in the mounting media for all immunofluorescence experiments to help identify all spirochetes in a given microscopic field. as a control for flab reactivity, organisms also were dried to slides and fixed with acetone to disrupt the outer membranes before co-incubation with the flab and c-myc antibodies, as shown in the rightmost panels of figure 1c. as expected, the fixed organisms fluoresced brightly with the flab antibodies.

structural models of the b. burgdorferi bam accessory lipoproteins
the b. burgdorferi bama protein has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with two accessory lipoproteins, encoded by open reading frames bb <dig> and bb <dig>  <cit> . bb <dig> was previously shown to share significant similarity with the n-terminus of bamd from n. meningitidis and to contain tetratricopeptide repeat  domains. tpr domains are antiparallel α-helices commonly involved in mediating protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the sequence similarity between bb <dig> and other known bamd proteins suggested bb <dig> is a putative bamd ortholog  <cit> . bb <dig>  however, shares no sequence similarity with any of the known or putative bam accessory proteins. when the i-tasser algorithm  <cit>  was used to model bamd/bb <dig> without a specified template, the structure predicted consisted of five stacked α-helical domains . this predicted structure was highly similar to the n-terminal region of the known e. coli bamd structure  <cit>  . bb <dig> was predicted by i-tasser to fold into a β-propeller structure , which is the known conformation of the e. coli bamb protein  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

generation of b. burgdorferi bamd/bb <dig> and bb <dig> mutants
while prior co-immunoprecipitation experiments  <cit>  combined with the structural modeling outlined above suggest bamd/bb <dig> and bb <dig> are members of the borrelial bam complex, neither of these approaches provided empirical evidence that they are functional components of the bam complex in b. burgdorferi. therefore, to determine if bamd/bb <dig> and/or bb <dig> function as would be expected of bam complex accessory proteins, we generated bamd/bb <dig> and bb <dig> mutants as described in the methods section. as shown in figure 3a, bamd/bb <dig> was deleted and replaced by a streptomycin resistance cassette using homologous recombination. the presence of the streptomycin resistance cassette was confirmed by pcr analyses using primers flanking bamd/bb <dig> . immunoblot with bamd/bb <dig> specific antisera confirmed that the bamd mutant strain, designated bamd::strepr, did not express bamd, as expected . numerous attempts to delete bb <dig> through homologous recombination were unsuccessful, which suggested bb <dig> may be essential for in vitro cultivation of b. burgdorferi. to overcome this potential caveat, we generated an iptg-regulatable mutant of bb <dig> by expressing the native bb <dig> gene under control of the iptg-inducible flacp promoter . the resulting strain was confirmed by pcr to contain the streptomycin resistance cassette/flacp promoter construct , and regulation of bb <dig> by iptg was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal, monospecific rat anti-bb <dig> antibodies .figure  <dig>

interestingly, the bb <dig> regulatable mutant was observed to replicate in vitro without addition of iptg in the growth media , although it should be noted that the organisms were qualitatively less motile when examined under the microscope and replicated at a much slower rate as compared to wildtype organisms expressing normal amounts of bb <dig>  this observation suggested that bb <dig>  while not absolutely essential for in vitro cultivation of the organism, may be relevant to the overall growth and physiology of b. burgdorferi. to more quantitatively examine these observations, we next examined the growth rate of the bb <dig> mutant in vitro, which revealed that the doubling time of the mutant was 14 h, while the parental strain had a doubling time of only 8 h. the bb <dig> mutant also required 72– <dig> hours longer to reach stationary phase as compared to the wildtype parental strain . to ensure that the ability of the bb <dig> mutant to grow in the absence of iptg was not the result of a secondary mutation in the laci gene or flacp promoter that allowed the mutant to express bb <dig>  we performed immunoblot analyses which confirmed that bb <dig> was not expressed in the mutant strain during cultivation . when similar growth curve analyses were performed on the bamd/bb <dig> mutant strain, no impact on the rate of in vitro growth was observed as compared with the parental strain .figure  <dig>

loss of bb <dig> or bamd/bb <dig> enhances antimicrobial sensitivity
in gram-negative bacteria, mutants lacking various bam accessory proteins have altered outer membrane  permeability and sensitivity profiles to antimicrobials  <cit> . therefore, we examined whether the absence of the b. burgdorferi bam accessory proteins bb <dig> or bamd/bb <dig> affected susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of specific antimicrobials, the respective parental wildtype and mutant strains were cultivated in media containing varying concentrations of carbenicillin, cefotaxime, tetracycline, or minocycline. as shown in table  <dig>  when compared to the wildtype b31-a3-lk strain, the susceptibility of the bb <dig> mutant  to carbenicillin increased by two-fold, and susceptibility to tetracycline increased by four-fold. the bamd/bb <dig> mutant  also exhibited altered susceptibility; it was observed to be two-fold and eight-fold more susceptible to tetracycline and minocycline, respectively, as compared to the parental b31-5a4np <dig> strain. we also examined the susceptibility profile of the b. burgdorferi iptg-regulatable bama mutant  <cit>  as a control. reducing bama expression using limiting amounts of iptg in the regulatable bama mutant  resulted in increased susceptibility to all antibiotics tested, as expected, with a four-fold increase in susceptibility to carbenicillin and two-fold increases to cefotaxime, tetracycline, and minocycline, as compared to the parental strain b31-a3-lk. taken together, these results suggest that both bb <dig> and bamd/bb <dig> play important, although possibly different, roles in om composition and/or integrity.table  <dig>

export of besc into the outer membrane is diminished in the bb <dig> mutant
to examine the underlying causes for the enhanced susceptibility of the different mutants to antimicrobial agents, we next examined whether the presence of the omp besc was altered in the om of the bb <dig> or bamd/bb <dig> mutant strains. besc is the outer membrane protein component of a known b. burgdorferi multidrug efflux complex that is involved in enhancing resistance to various antimicrobials  <cit> . we therefore performed immunoblot analysis on isolated om fractions to examine the level of besc exported into the om of the bb <dig> and bamd/bb <dig> mutant strains. interestingly, when equal amounts of the isolated om fractions were compared, there was a marked decrease in the amount of besc located in the om of the bb <dig> mutant as compared to its parental wildtype strain . by contrast, no observable decrease in besc was detected in the om fraction of the bamd mutant strain as compared to its wildtype parental strain . the overall expression of besc and its export to the inner membrane also did not appear to be significantly altered in either mutant since besc levels in the protoplasmic cylinder  fractions were comparable between bb <dig> and bamd/bb <dig> mutants and their respective parental strains . as shown in figure 6a  and figure 6b , bb <dig> and bamd/bb <dig> expression levels and om localization were not affected by the absence of bamd/bb <dig> or bb <dig>  respectively. membranes were also immunoblotted with antisera to cspa, an om-localized lipoprotein, to ensure equivalent amounts of pc and om fractions were loaded for the immunoblot analyses . finally, oppaiv, a known inner membrane lipoprotein, was used to confirm that the om fractions were highly purified and devoid of contaminating pc components . the combined analyses indicate that besc export into the om of b. burgdorferi is diminished in the bb <dig> mutant but not in the bamd/bb <dig> mutant.figure  <dig>

bama independently interacts with bb <dig> and bamd/bb0324
we have previously shown that bama co-immunoprecipitates bamd/bb <dig> and bb <dig>  <cit> . these prior studies, however, did not examine whether bamd/bb <dig> and bb <dig> interact independently with bama or if they actually interact with each other as a module and only bb <dig> or bamd/bb <dig> interacts in a specific manner with bama. therefore, as shown in figure 7a, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using bama  and bb <dig>  specific antibodies in the bamd/bb <dig> mutant and wildtype strains. bama and bb <dig> could co-immunoprecipitate each other in the absence of bamd/bb <dig>  similarly, as shown in figure 7b, co-immunoprecipitations with bama  and bamd/bb <dig>  specific antibodies revealed that bama and bamd/bb <dig> could co-immunoprecipitate each other in the absence of bb <dig>  the collective co-immunoprecipitation data indicate that bb <dig> and bamd/bb <dig> each independently interact with bama.figure  <dig>

discussion
the bam complex in b. burgdorferi
currently, the predicted composition of the b. burgdorferi β-barrel assembly machine  complex consists of only three proteins: bama, bb <dig>  and bamd/bb <dig>  the combined structural and functional data presented here are consistent with bb <dig> and bb <dig> being bamb and bamd orthologs, respectively. while we previously suggested that bb <dig> is a bamd ortholog  <cit> , the current data fully support the new designation of bamb for bb <dig>  hereafter, we will refer to bb <dig> as bamb and bb <dig> as bamd. further, the co-immunoprecipitation data revealed that the borrelial bamb and bamd lipoproteins interact specifically and independently with the central bama protein, which is also entirely consistent with this newly proposed nomenclature. the combined data provided in this report have led us to also propose a new working model for the b. burgdorferi bam complex where bamd and bamb each interact directly and independently with the bama protein . future studies will be needed to fully dissect the specific interactions between bamb and bamd with the periplasmic polypeptide transport-associated  domains of bama in b. burgdorferi.figure  <dig>

structural models for the b. burgdorferi bama, bamb, and bamd proteins
the recent crystal structures of bama from n. gonorrhoeae, h. ducreyi, and e. coli  <cit>  allowed us to refine the prior model of the borrelial bama protein  <cit> . while all three of these structures are highly conserved, there is only between 49-62% similarity between the n. gonorrhoeae, h. ducreyi, and e. coli bama proteins. this indicates that while the bama proteins from different organisms are highly conserved at the three-dimensional level, they are quite divergent at the primary sequence level. for example, the n. gonorrhoeae bama protein shares between 29-52% sequence similarity to bama orthologs from other bacterial phyla. accordingly, b. burgdorferi bama is 33% similar to n. gonorrhoeae bama but was predicted to be highly conserved structurally. the model predicted for b. burgdorferi bama contains a c-terminal β-barrel region consisting of  <dig> transmembrane domains and five potra domains along with a unique α-helical region within extracellular loop four, which is a conserved feature that has been identified in all bama crystal structures reported to date  <cit> . extracellular loop six in b. burgdorferi was predicted to be elongated and associated with the lumen of the protein, which is also similar to the known bama structures  <cit> . additionally, as recently highlighted by albrecht and co-workers  <cit> , extracellular loop six of all known bama structures contains a conserved three amino acid arginine-glycine-phenylalanine/tyrosine triad, referred to as the rgf motif, which has been shown to be essential for bama function  <cit> . interestingly, extracellular loop six in the predicted b. burgdorferi bama structure was observed to contain an rgw triad, which is consistent with it corresponding to the rgf motif given that the r and g are identical and the third amino acid is aromatic  like in all other rgf motifs identified to date  <cit> . future site-directed mutational studies will be required to determine if this rgw triad plays an important role in b. burgdorferi bam function.

structural modeling of the borrelial accessory lipoproteins revealed that the bamb protein folds into a β-propeller, which is a structure conserved among all bamb orthologs  <cit> . this structural conservation, combined with its specific interaction with bama, is consistent with the conclusion that bb <dig> is the borrelial bamb ortholog. the b. burgdorferi bamd protein was predicted to form a helix-loop-helix structure consisting of five α-helices stacked on top of each other. this same type of folding and helix stacking is also found in the solved structures of the bamd orthologs from e. coli and rhodothermus marinus  <cit> . interestingly, the bamd ortholog in b. burgdorferi is c-terminally truncated and is half the size, or less, compared with other bamd orthologs  <cit> . the c-terminal portion of bamd has previously been reported to be integral to mediating the interaction between bamd and bamc in e. coli  <cit> . the apparent lack of a bamc ortholog in b. burgdorferi would be consistent with the c-terminal region of bamd being dispensable in b. burgdorferi. this finding also further supports the notion that the bam complex in b. burgdorferi is limited to bama, bamb, and bamd.

functional roles of bamb and bamd in b. burgdorferi
while we were able to generate a bamd null mutant, we were initially unable to generate a bamb knockout. to overcome this obstacle, we utilized an iptg-regulatable promoter system to control expression of bamb so we could examine the role of bamb in the borrelial bam complex. interestingly, the bamb regulatable mutant grew in the absence of iptg and was shown to lack bamb protein expression. this finding suggests bamb is not essential, at least for in vitro growth, in b. burgdorferi. lack of bamb expression, however, did impact the overall physiology of the organism as the bamb mutant had a doubling time 75% greater than that of the parental strain. while the bamb null mutant had a marked growth phenotype, which is similar to what has been observed in an e. coli bamb mutant  <cit> , it was surprising that the borrelial bamd mutant had no observable growth defect given that bamd orthologs have been reported to be essential in all bacteria studied to date  <cit>  other than salmonella enteritidis  <cit> . in the case of s. enteritidis, however, while bamd is not essential, the null mutant has a substantially compromised growth rate and reduced viability as compared to the parental strain  <cit> . additionally, s. enteritidis bamd mutants show reduced amounts of export of ompa into their oms  <cit> . given that b. burgdorferi has at least 10-fold fewer omps relative to surface area than the typical gram-negative organism, this may suggest that the role of bamd is unique in this spirochete  <cit> . future studies examining omp export in the bamd mutant will be required to better understand the role of bamd in the borrelial bam complex, omp export, and om permeability/integrity.

bam accessory protein mutants have been shown to have altered membrane integrity and/or impaired export of omps in other organisms studied  <cit> . consistent with this latter observation, we also observed a distinct decrease in the amount of besc exported into the om of the bamb mutant, which could explain the differing antibiotic susceptibility profiles observed between the bamb and bamd mutants. the antibiotics we utilized for susceptibility testing typically enter the bacterial cell either through aqueous channels such as porins  or by traversing the lipid bilayer   <cit> . given that besc can form channels in lipid bilayers  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that the reduction in the om of besc in the bamb mutant correlates with increased susceptibility to the pore-transiting antibiotics carbenicillin and tetracycline. by contrast, the bamd mutant was eight-fold more susceptible to the membrane permeable antibiotic minocycline as compared to the bamb mutant, suggesting that membrane integrity is altered in the bamd mutant, which could lead to enhanced diffusion of this hydrophobic antibiotic across the om. while future studies will be required to better examine global effects of bamb and bamd on omp export and membrane integrity, the antibiotic susceptibility and omp trafficking data presented here provide evidence that both of these bam accessory proteins play important, although different, roles in b. burgdorferi physiology and om biogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that b. burgdorferi bama, bamb, and bamd are predicted to be structurally very similar to other known bama, bamb, and bamd orthologs. through generation and characterization of bamb and bamd mutants in b. burgdorferi, we have shown that bamb has a major effect on physiology and growth rate and both bamb and bamd mutants exhibit altered sensitivity profiles to various antimicrobial compounds. the combined results suggest that they play distinct roles in omp trafficking and membrane composition. additionally, the absence of bamb results in a decrease in the presence of the omp besc in the borrelial om, which may account for its altered sensitivity profile to various antibiotics, especially the more hydrophilic antimicrobials such as carbenicillin and tetracycline. bamb and bamd were observed to interact specifically and independently with bama, which led to our newly proposed working model of the tripartite b. burgdorferi bam complex. the bam complex model provided here lays the foundation for future studies aimed at dissecting the interaction among the bam complex components, which should better elucidate om biogenesis in this unique spirochete.
