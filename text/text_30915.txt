BACKGROUND
the transmembrane presenilin   <dig> and  <dig> proteins are the catalytic subunits of the γ-secretase complex, which mediates intramembranous proteolytic cleavage of a number of transmembrane proteins  <cit> . in addition to the psen proteins the γ-secretase complex includes pen- <dig>  nicastrin and aph- <dig>  examples of γ-secretase processed proteins are notch, jagged, cd <dig>  lrp, ngfrd, erbb <dig>  and app. a common theme in γ-secretase mediated proteolytic processing is the generation of intracellular c-terminal domains, which migrates to the nuclear compartment to regulate expression of target genes. γ-secretase-independent functions of the psen proteins have also been described, including regulation of protein localization, apoptosis, calcium homoeostasis, and wnt signal transduction  <cit> . human psen <dig> and psen <dig> share more than 60% amino acid identity and both psens are processed proteolytically to generate amino- and carboxyl-fragments, which associate in the bioactive γ-secretase complex  <cit> .

the psens are multifunctional and have important roles in embryonic development through regulation of cellular signal transduction pathways. thus, studies of psen1-deficient mice showed that homozygous null mutants die perinatally and that psen <dig> is required for formation of the axial skeleton, normal neurogenesis, and neuronal survival  <cit> . the psen <dig> mutant phenotype can in part be explained from experiments in mouse  <cit> , caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , and drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , which have demonstrated an essential role for psens in notch signalling  <cit> . psen <dig> homozygous null mutant mice are viable, presumable due to a compensation effect of the more abundantly expressed psen <dig>  interestingly, complete loss of both psens causes more widespread developmental defects than observed for the psen <dig> null mutant, which suggest overlapping but not identical cellular roles of psen <dig> and psen <dig>  <cit> . importantly, genetic and biochemical evidence have demonstrated that mutations in human psen <dig> and psen <dig> play a role in the development of familiar alzheimer's disease by altering app processing to increase the ratio between the more aggregation-prone aβ <dig> peptide and the aβ <dig> variant  <cit> 

although studies of the psens in caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster and mice have yielded important insight into the biological role of the psens, several essential questions still remain concerning the developmental functions of psen <dig> and psen <dig>  strong anatomical, physiological and biochemical similarities between man and pig suggest that this animal may constitute a suitable alternative model for research related to alzheimer's disease, although alzheimer-like neuropathology including aβ deposits in the brains of aged pigs to our knowledge has not yet been described. to begin to address this possibility, we here present the first molecular characterization of the porcine psens by sequence analysis, determination of chromosomal localization and screening for polymorphisms. moreover, the expression profiles of psen <dig> and psen <dig> were studied both at the mrna and protein levels in several areas of the embryonic pig brain. the results show a high degree of evolutionary conservation of both the porcine primary sequences and the expression patterns compared to those observed in human and rodents.

RESULTS
psen <dig> and psen <dig> cdna and protein sequence
to determine the cdna sequence of porcine psen <dig>  we designed a set of primers based on the conserved 5' and 3' untranslated regions between the rodent, bovine, and human psen <dig>  using rt-pcr, the cdna representing the entire pig psen <dig> open reading frame was amplified, cloned and sequenced. the porcine cdna was highly homologous  throughout the sequence to human psen <dig> sequence, but only homologous to human psen <dig> in short dispersed regions. the length of the deduced porcine psen <dig> protein was  <dig> amino acids, which is identical to the sizes of the human and mouse counterparts . multiple amino acid sequence alignment of psen <dig> revealed  <dig> % sequence identity between the pig and human proteins . furthermore,  <dig> amino acid changes were observed between the two sequences of which  <dig> were conservative substitutions. comparison of pig and mouse amino acid sequences revealed 89% identity, and  <dig> out of  <dig> amino acid changes were conservative. the cow psen <dig> consists of  <dig> amino acids with  <dig> % identity to the porcine protein, and  <dig> out of  <dig> amino acid substitutions were conservative. mutations in human psen <dig> cause alzheimer's disease and it is noteworthy that none of the amino acid changes between pig and human are located in positions known to cause alzheimer's disease .  at position  <dig> where the human psen <dig> contains a non-pathogenic polymorphism, e318g, a q residue is present at the equivalent positions in pig, cow, and mouse psen <dig>  <cit> . two non-pathogenic polymorphisms r35q and f175s in human psen <dig> are occupied by r and f in the porcine psen <dig>   <cit> .

the human psen <dig> cdna sequence was used for blastn searches against ncbi databases as well as an in-house porcine est database  <cit>  to identify sequences for the design of primers corresponding to the 5'-end of the coding region and the 3'-non-coding region of the pig psen <dig>  the primers amplified a cdna fragment of approximately  <dig>  kb, which was cloned and sequenced. analysis revealed high nucleotide sequence homology with human psen <dig> , whereas homology to the human psen <dig> cdna was restricted to small, dispersed regions, which demonstrates that the cloned fragment encodes the porcine homolog of psen <dig>  translation of the open reading frame showed that the porcine psen <dig> protein like the human and mouse homologs consisted of  <dig> amino acid residues . multiple amino acid sequence alignment revealed  <dig>  % sequence identity between the pig and the human psen <dig>  and  <dig> of the observed  <dig> changes was conservative . comparison of pig and mouse amino acid sequences showed an identity of  <dig> % with  <dig> out of the  <dig> changes being conservative. the cow psen <dig> has a length of  <dig> amino acids and a sequence identity of  <dig>  %, where  <dig> of the  <dig> substitutions are conservative. thus, as observed for psen <dig>  also the porcine psen <dig> protein showed the highest degree of identity to the bovine counterpart. moreover, it should be noted that none of the observed changes between the sequences of the different species are located in psen <dig> positions identified as being mutated in alzheimer's disease patients   <cit> . at position  <dig> a non-pathogenic polymorphism, p334r, has been identified in human psen <dig>  <cit> , and the proline residue was conserved in the porcine protein.

the amino acid sequence for porcine psen <dig> shows 64% identity to porcine psen <dig> and particularly amino acids in the transmembrane domains and the c-terminus are conserved . also, the two aspartic acid residues located in transmembrane domain  <dig>  and the transmembrane domain  <dig> , as well as the "pal" sequence,  are conserved in both porcine psen <dig> and psen <dig>  consistent with the essential role of these residues for the protease catalytic function of the presenilins  <cit> .

mapping of porcine psen <dig> and psen2
a porcine-rodent somatic cell hybrid panel was used for the chromosomal mapping of porcine psen <dig> and psen <dig> genes   <cit> . statistical evaluation by applying the "interpreting pcr data" program  <cit>  resulted in a chromosomal assignment of the psen <dig> gene to chromosome 7q12-q <dig> with a probability of  <dig>  and a correlation of  <dig>  this conclusion gains support from the facts that the specified region of porcine chromosome  <dig> shares homology with the human chromosome  <dig>  and that the human psen <dig> gene has been mapped to hsa14q <dig>   <cit> . however, the relatively low probability value suggests that the chromosomal position of the porcine psen <dig> gene should be considered preliminary. the psen <dig> gene was assigned to chromosome 10p11-p <dig> with a probability of  <dig>  and a correlation of  <dig> , which is in agreement with the syntenic relationship between porcine chromosome  <dig> and human chromosome  <dig>  and the known position of psen <dig> on hsa1q31-q <dig>  <cit> .

single nucleotide polymorphism screening of porcine psen1
to examine for genetic variation in porcine psen <dig>  we resequenced exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in a large animal material consisting of  <dig> landrace/yorkshire crossbreed sows and a pig breed panel consisting of  <dig> landrace, duroc, yorkshire and hampshire breeds. these exons were chosen for sequence analysis because they constitute "hotspots" for mutations in familiar alzheimer's disease. however, no snp's were identified in the  <dig> exonic regions . next, we extended the polymorphism analysis to include intronic sequences, which identified a c/t snp at position  <dig> in intron  <dig>  as well as two c/t polymorphisms at positions  <dig> and  <dig> and a g/a polymorphism at position  <dig> in intron  <dig> . the genotyping data are summarized in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  all breeds except hampshire were polymorphic in intron  <dig> and at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in intron  <dig>  whereas only the yorkshire breed was polymorphic at position  <dig> in intron  <dig>  genotype frequencies were in accordance with hardy-weinberg equilibrium, indicating that no selective disadvantage is associated with the snps.

psen expression in the developing porcine brain
psen <dig> and psen <dig> have been shown to be widely expressed during embryonic development and especially the expression profile in the cns is well characterized  <cit> . here, we measured the mrna expression levels of psen <dig> and psen <dig> in hippocampus, cerebellum, frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and brain stem from dissected porcine foetus brains at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of gestation using three biological samples for each of the time points. day e <dig> corresponds to the normal day of birth. the pcr analyses were performed in triplicates. the requirement for a proper internal control gene was met by normalization to the gapdh expression level to compensate for inter-pcr variation with respect to rna integrity and sample loading. we did not find any significant variation in expression of gapdh within the  <dig> different porcine brain tissues at the various developmental stages. the standard curve for the control gapdh , psen <dig> , and psen <dig>  were generated by plotting ct values versus log μl of cdna. the slope of the regression line was used to calculate the amount of cdna and thus mrna in each sample. all gapdh cdna's generated almost identical ct values within each type of tissue  and accordingly the mrna expression levels of psen <dig> and psen <dig> were normalized to the gapdh expression level. ethidium bromide-staining after real time pcr confirmed specific amplification of the relevant pcr products .

psen <dig> and psen <dig> were expressed in all  <dig> tissues at the  <dig> time points evaluated. however, it should be noted, that for both psen <dig> and psen <dig> the mean standard deviation is considerable, reflecting a high heterogeneity among animals. in basal ganglia the psen <dig> expression levels did not vary significantly between the different times of gestation . in frontal cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus the psen <dig> expression level was significantly lower at day  <dig> of gestation compared to day  <dig> , yielding a reduction of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> times for these tissues . furthermore, the reduction in psen <dig> expression in frontal cortex is also significant at day  <dig> compared to day  <dig> . similarly, psen <dig> expression is gradually reduced in hippocampus during the time period of gestation . moreover, the same tendency is seen in cerebellum, however the reduction in expression levels is only significant between day  <dig> and  <dig>  and day  <dig> and  <dig> .

for psen <dig> no differential expression was observed in frontal cortex. in hippocampus the only significant variation was seen as an increase in expression level between day  <dig> and  <dig> of gestation  . also in the brain stem, psen <dig> is upregulated between day  <dig> and  <dig> of gestation  . in cerebellum and basal ganglia the expression levels of psen <dig> are up-regulated between day  <dig> and  <dig>  . in conclusion, the real time pcr analysis showed significant, but small, alterations in the expression levels of psen <dig> and psen <dig> mrna in different brain compartments during embryonic brain development, which likely reflect biological importance. furthermore, western blotting  showed only minor differences in the levels of ps <dig> and ps <dig> in the frontal cortex between various time points, which generally agree well with the real time pcr measurements of expression. both antibodies used in the present study have been used previously in western blots to detect ps <dig> and ps <dig> in human and mouse homogenates  <cit> . figure 4a and 4b show that both antibodies detected a band at ≈  <dig> kda, representing the full-length proteins. the bands located below the  <dig> kda suggest that porcine psens are subject to proteolytic processing as observed in other species.

to examine the localization of the psen <dig> and psen <dig> proteins in situ we utilized immunohistochemical stainings at embryonic day  <dig> brain slides with antibodies for psen <dig> and psen <dig>  psen <dig> staining was more intense and had a more diffuse staining pattern outside cell bodies than observed for the psen <dig> staining . we note that all psen <dig> stained regions also were positive for psen <dig> staining . similar localization or intensity of psen <dig> and psen <dig> staining were detected in analysis of other embryonic time points or brain regions . intracellular immunostaining was confined to the cytoplasm with a distinct sparing of the nuclei. the immunostaining was observed in all parts of the cns, especially in neurons but also to some extend in astrocytes . in cortex both pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells were stained . also, all hippocampus ca subfields and the granule cells were psen positive . the immunohistochemical analysis supports that the psen proteins are located in the majority, if not all, of the neurons. moreover, all psen <dig> stained cell types were also positive for psen <dig> staining in accordance with the observed redundancies in psen <dig> and psen <dig> functions  <cit> .

discussion
here we describe the isolation and primary characterization of psen <dig> and psen <dig> from pigs. thus, chromosomal mapping assigned the porcine psen <dig> and psen <dig> to ssc7q12-q <dig> and ssc10p11-p <dig>  respectively, which is in accordance with the known syntenic relationships with human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . pig psen <dig> and psen <dig> have protein sequences that are highly homologous to the human counterparts. conservation included the two catalytic aspartic acid residues located in adjacent transmembrane domains, the c-terminal "pal" sequence involved in defining the catalytic active site conformation, all of the nine transmembrane domains, and the c-terminal part. the evolutionary conservation of these amino acid segments strongly advocate that they are essential for psen functions  <cit> . for instance, the aspartate residues are critical for psen <dig> endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity, leading to the hypothesis that the proteolytic cleavage generating the n- and c-terminal psen fragments is an autocatalytic event necessary for activation of psen, and that psens are the intrinsic catalytic subunits for γ-secretase aspartyl protease activity  <cit> . furthermore, non-conservative mutations within the invariant pal sequence abolish psen <dig> endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity, indicating that this sequence is crucial for the enzymatic activity  <cit> . approximately,  <dig> mutations in human psen <dig> and ten mutations in human psen <dig> have been associated with early onset alzheimer's disease  <cit> . we observed complete identity between pig and human psens of amino acid residues, which have been mutated in alzheimer's patients. this identity extends to the mouse and cow psens, which underscores the functional importance of these residues, and further supports the notion that the pig psens share the biological functions of other mammalian psens.

we did not find any snp's in exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  which are hotspots for mutations causing familiar alzheimer's disease. however, one snp was found in intron  <dig> and three others in intron  <dig>  the allele frequencies of these snps differed markedly between hampshire and the other porcine breeds, possibly reflecting the different origins of these breeds. snps are amenable to high-throughput analysis and, therefore, an attractive type of dna marker for animal identification, paternity testing, and genome scans for qtl and disease genes.

expression profiling showed a distinct spatiotemporal regulation of psen transcription in various brain regions at embryonic days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  thus, variation in gene expression was observed for psen <dig> in frontal cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus, whereas psen <dig> expression in basal ganglia and brainstem did not vary significantly between the different embryonic stages. the variation pointed towards a reduction in psen <dig> expression between day  <dig> and day  <dig> of gestation. also, psen <dig> showed differential expression during the gestation period in some of the tested tissues. the variation in expression levels suggests that both psen <dig> and psen <dig> play specific functions during embryonic brain development. in this context, it is noteworthy that mice lacking psen <dig> die shortly after birth and show a thinner ventricular zone, and substantial degeneration of the subcortical region of the temporal lobe at embryonic day  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . in comparison, psen <dig> deficient mice show no alterations in brain anatomy, and only with increasing age developed mild pulmonary fibrosis  <cit> . however, mice deficient in both psen <dig> and psen <dig> display early embryonic patterning defects resulting in lethality   <cit> . this suggests that psen <dig> is capable of performing some psen <dig> functions in early developmental stages, and that psen <dig> largely can substitute for psen <dig> functions during development. our immunohistochemical analysis showed that at the protein level psen <dig> are expressed in the same cells in the cns as psen <dig> and that the psens localize mainly in neuronal cell types but also in astrocytes. such localizations were in accordance with human, mouse and, rat brain studies  <cit> . taken together, the expression data support the notion that redundancy of psen <dig> and psen <dig> functions during development might be attributed to both the high degree of sequence similarity and the consistent expression of psen <dig> in cells also expressing psen <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
our data show that the pig psens are conserved both at the primary sequence level and in patterns of gene expression during embryonic brain development. since pigs share many physiologic and anatomic characteristics with humans, this makes them interesting and attractive models for developmental studies  <cit> . the here presented initial characterization of the porcine psens could be the first step towards a future inclusion of the pig as a model animal to study and elucidate the biological functions of the psens.
