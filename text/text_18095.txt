BACKGROUND
cotton is one of the most economically important crop plants in the world and is the most important textile fiber crop worldwide. the most widely cultivated cotton species today are allotetraploid gossypium hirsutum followed by gossypium barbadense, both of which are originated from interspecific hybridization between the a-genome species gossypium arboreum  and the d-genome species gossypium raimondii   <cit> .

verticillium wilt and fusarium wilt are two of the most destructive diseases in cotton production worldwide. verticillium wilt is caused by the soilborne fungal pathogen verticillium dahliae. g. raimondii is nearly immune to the pathogen, and g. barbadense is usually resistant or highly resistant to v. dahliae, whereas g. arboreum and g. hirsutum are often susceptible to v. dahliae . fusarium wilt is caused by another soilborne fungal pathogen fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum. g. barbadense is often more susceptible to f. oxysporum compared to g. arboreum and g. hirsutum  <cit> .

resistance  genes play a central role in recognizing effectors from pathogens and in triggering downstream signaling during plant response to pathogen invasions  <cit> . numerous r genes from many plants have been cloned and characterized over the past few decades  <cit> . most of the cloned r genes are nucleotide-binding sites  genes containing a nbs domain and constitute one of the largest plant resistance gene family  <cit> . the nbs domain is part of the larger ~ <dig> amino acid nb-arc  domain and contains five strictly ordered motifs including p-loop, kinase- <dig>  kinase-3a, glpl and mhdl  <cit> . the nbs region binds and hydrolyzes atp or gtp, and primarily works as a signal transduction switch following pathogen recognition  <cit> . nbs-encoding genes usually contain additional domains, tir , cc  or rpw <dig>  in the n-terminal domain and lrr  domains in the c-terminal region  <cit> .

nbs-encoding genes can be further classified into two major groups according to the presence or absence of different domains in the n-terminal region. the first group is comprised of proteins carrying tir and members of the group are named tnl proteins . the second, non-tir-nbs-lrr group is usually known as cnl  and rnl , because most of its members encode cc or rpw <dig> in the n-terminal domain  <cit> .

with the availability of genomic data for increasing number of cotton species, nbs-encoding genes could be systematically investigated to elucidate their role in contributing to the differences and relationships of disease resistances among cotton species, and help to decipher the mechanisms of disease resistance in cotton. the genome sequences of the two diploid cotton species, g. raimondii and g. arboreum, and the two allotetraploid cotton species, g. hirsutum  and g. barbadense, have been reported . in the present work, the assembled genome sequences were utilized to identify nbs disease resistance genes for the four cotton species. multiple approaches were utilized to assess these nbs genes’ architecture in the genome and their evolutionary history, including the characterization of functional domains, their distributions across the genome, their phylogenetic relationships and so on. the analysis provided genome level insights into disease resistance genes among cotton species, which can help to reveal the mechanism of disease-resistance and accelerate the disease-resistant breeding of cotton.

RESULTS
identification and classification of nbs-encoding genes

g. arboreum, g. raimondii, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense were selected to identify and compare nbs-encoding genes in their genomes. searches with hmmer  <dig> b <dig> in the g. arboreum, g. raimondii, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense genomes resulted in the identification of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nbs genes containing nb-arc domain, respectively . the two allotetraploid cotton plants possessed almost twice the number of nbs genes compared to the two diploid cotton plants, probably because of hybridization between g. arboreum and g. raimondii without gene losses, or hybridization with rapid gene losses followed by gene replication after their divergence from the initial hybrid. it can also be due to the combination of the two processes.table  <dig> classification and distribution of nbs-encoding genes in the four cotton genomes

additional domains, tir, cc or rpw <dig> in the n-terminal region and lrr domains in the c-terminal region, were identified in the nbs-encoding genes. if a tir, cc or rpw <dig> domain was detected before nb-arc domain, it was coded as “t”, “c”, “r”, respectively; if lrr domain was detected after nb-arc domain, it was coded as “l”. the nb-arc domain was coded as “n”. the nbs-encoding genes were sub-classified into eight types according to their domain architecture : cn, cnl, n, nl, rn, rnl, tn and tnl. as shown in table  <dig>  g. arboreum possessed a larger proportion of cn, cnl, and n genes and a lower proportion of nl, tn and tnl genes than g. raimondii. for example, the proportions of cn, cnl and n genes of the diploid g. arboreum were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, while the proportions of cn, cnl and n genes of the diploid g. raimondii were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . however, the percentage differences of rn or rnl genes between g. arboreum and g. raimondii were less than 1%, so the proportions of rn and rnl genes remained relatively unchanged. similar results were observed between the two allotetraploid cotton species: g. hirsutum possessed a larger proportion of cn, cnl, and n genes and a lower proportion of nl, tn and tnl genes than g. barbadense, and the proportions of rn and rnl genes remained relatively unchanged. therefore, with respect to the proportions of different nbs type genes, g. arboreum and g. hirsutum share similar distribution profiles, while g. raimondii and g. barbadense share similar distribution profiles. the results suggest that g. hirsutum may preferentially inherit nbs-encoding genes from g. arboreum progenitor, while g. barbadense may preferentially inherit nbs-encoding genes from g. raimondii progenitor. moreover, the greatest percentage changes between g. raimondii and g. arboreum, and between g. barbadense and g. hirsutum, occurred in the tnl type genes, about  <dig> times. therefore, these tnl genes may play a significant role in disease resistance in g. raimondii and g. barbadense.

in addition, the exon number of nbs genes was calculated based on the annotation information of cotton genomes . nbs genes in g. raimondii and g. barbadense were predicted to have  <dig>  and  <dig>  exons in average respectively, which was much larger than the average number of nbs genes in g. arboretum and g. hirsutum,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the mean exon numbers in eight nbs gene type were quite different in each cotton species, but the exons of nbs genes with tir or rpw <dig> domain were generally more than that of other nbs type genes, especially tnl type genes containing mean  <dig>  to  <dig>  exons. the larger exon number in cotton tnl type genes was consistent with the results of a previous study in the arabidopsis, poplar, grapevine and rosaceae  <cit> .

chromosome location and gene cluster identification
based on the location of individual nbs genes,  <dig> nbs genes and  <dig> of the  <dig> nbs genes, were mapped on the  <dig> chromosomes of g. arboreum  and g. raimondii , respectively;  <dig> of the  <dig> nbs genes and  <dig> of the  <dig> nbs genes were mapped on the  <dig> chromosomes  of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense, respectively . the remaining nbs genes were located on other scaffolds that had not been yet linked to a chromosome .fig.  <dig> distribution of nbs-encoding genes in chromosomes. a distribution in g. arboreum chromosomes. b distribution in g. raimondii chromosomes




the distribution of nbs-encoding genes was nonrandom among the chromosomes . for example, g.arboreum chromosome a <dig> contained the greatest number  of nbs-encoding genes, including  <dig> of the  <dig> nbs gene types ; whereas only four nbs-encoding genes were located on chromosome a <dig> which contained  <dig> nbs gene types . g. raimondii chromosome d <dig> contained the greatest number  of nbs-encoding genes, including  <dig> of the  <dig> nbs gene types ; whereas only one nbs-encoding gene was located on chromosome d <dig>  g. hirsutum chromosome d <dig> contained the greatest number  of nbs-encoding genes, including  <dig> nbs gene types ; whereas no nbs-encoding gene was located on chromosome d <dig>  g. barbadense chromosome a <dig> contained the greatest number  of nbs-encoding genes, including  <dig> nbs gene types ; whereas no nbs-encoding gene was located on chromosome d <dig> 

moreover, the distribution of nbs-encoding genes was not even within the chromosomes and they tended to form clusters in other plants  . this clustered arrangement has been thought to facilitate sequence exchange through recombinational mispairing  <cit> . studies of nbs-encoding genes in arabidopsis, rice, sorghum and maize also indicated uneven distributions on chromosomes and showed that most nbs-encoding genes were found in clusters . to identify nbs gene clusters, we used a previous definition  <cit>  that a gene cluster was considered a chromosome or a scaffold region when such region contained two or more genes within 200 kb. using this criteria, we identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clusters containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nbs genes in g. arboreum, g. raimondii, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense, respectively . the size of the clusters varied across the genome from  <dig> to  <dig> members . each cluster had an average of about  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes and about  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of nbs genes occurred in clusters in g. arboreum, g. raimondii, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense, respectively . these results indicate that nbs-encoding genes of the four cotton species also tend to form clusters and the average nbs gene numbers per cluster among species were different . interestingly, though the total numbers of nbs-encoding genes among the four cotton species were quite different, their proportions of cluster genes remained relatively unchanged, 74-79% . these proportions are greatly different from those of maize  and sorghum , but only slightly different from those of rice, arabidopsis or medicago truncatula   <cit> . we also identified  <dig> nbs-encoding genes and  <dig> nbs clusters in the genome of theobroma cacao, a close relative of cotton . the  <dig> nbs clusters contained  <dig> nbs genes averaging  <dig>  genes per cluster. about  <dig> % of nbs genes occurred in clusters. apparently, the proportion of nbs cluster genes in cacao was closer to that in cotton than to that in the other crops such as maize and sorghum. it was speculated that the duplication and clustering of nbs genes may be related to species evolution.table  <dig> organization of nbs-encoding genes in ten plant genomes

similarity analysis of nbs-encoding genes among the four cotton species
allotetraploid g. hirsutum and g. barbadense originated from interspecific hybridization between the a-genome species g. arboreum  and the d-genome species g. raimondii   <cit> . to further elucidate the evolutionary relationship of nbs-encoding genes between the allotetraploid and the diploid cotton species, the nbs-encoding proteins with sequence similarity greater than  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 30% between the allotetraploid and diploid cotton species were identified , respectively. the numbers of non-redundant nbs-encoding genes under different similarity level in g. hirsutum, g. barbadense, g. arboreum and g. raimondii were then calculated, respectively . the results revealed that the number of non-redundant nbs-encoding genes in g. hirsutum or g. barbadense increased with decreasing sequence similarity, but the amount of increases became smaller . for sequence similarity greater than 70%, the proportion of nbs-encoding genes in g. hirsutum or g. barbadense was greater than 75%. for sequence similarity greater than 50%, the proportion of nbs-encoding genes in g. hirsutum or g. barbadense was greater than 90%. therefore, nbs-encoding genes of the allotetraploid cotton had high amino acid sequence similarity with that of the diploid cotton.table  <dig> number of nbs-encoding genes and the corresponding proportions under different sequence similarity levels between the genomes for the four cotton species

the numbers of nbs-encoding genes in g. hirsutum and g. barbadense were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively; about two times of the number of nbs-encoding genes in g. arboreum and g. raimondii,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. however, the disease resistances of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense were not always stronger than g. arboreum and g. raimondii. the reason may be that most of nbs-encoding genes of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense had high amino acid sequence similarity with that of g. arboreum and g. raimondii, respectively . comparing sequence similarities between g. hirsutum and the two diploid cotton species, as signed with the solid triangles in table  <dig>  revealed that the nbs-encoding gene proportion of g. arboreum was greater than that of g. raimondii in g. hirsutum at all the sequence similarity levels. for example, 82% of nbs-encoding genes of g. arboreum compared to only 71% of the genes of g. raimondii had orthologous in g. hirsutum at greater than 80% sequence similarity level, indicating that g. hirsutum may inherit more nbs-encoding genes from g. arboreum than from g. raimondii. similarly, comparing the sequence similarities between g. barbadense and the two diploid cotton species, as signed with the solid squares in table  <dig>  revealed that the nbs-encoding gene proportion of g. raimondii was greater than that of g. arboreum at all the sequence similarity levels. for example, 85% of nbs-encoding genes of g. raimondii compared to only 75% of the genes of g. arboreum had orthologous in g. barbadense at greater than 80% sequence similarity level, indicating that g. barbadense may inherit more nbs-encoding genes from g. raimondii than from g. arboreum. these evidences further support the findings of closely genetic relationships between g. hirsutum and g. arboreum, and between g. barbadense and g. raimondii from the study of the proportion comparisons of different nbs type genes in cotton species .

the nbs-encoding proteins with sequence similarity greater than  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 30% between g. arboreum and g. raimondii were also identified , respectively and the corresponding numbers of non-redundant nbs genes were calculated . the proportion of similar nbs-encoding genes between g. arboreum and g. raimondii was also high . for sequence similarity greater than 70%, the nbs-encoding gene proportions of g. arboreum and g. raimondii were more than 80%, indicating that these nbs-encoding genes were homogenous, and more tandem duplications of nbs-encoding genes may occur in g. raimondii than in g. arboreum after their divergence. there were  <dig> and  <dig> nbs genes  whose sequence similarity were less than 30% between the two genomes of g. arboreum and g. raimondii, respectively and they were all n type genes. these  <dig> and  <dig> nbs genes may play important roles in providing different disease resistance capabilities in g. arboreum and g. raimondii, respectively.

synteny analysis of nbs genes between diploid and allotetraploid cotton
the synteny of genes across several plant species could provide insights to its evolution. the synteny analysis of nbs genes between diploid and allotetraploid cotton was conducted using mcscanx . there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> syntenic blocks of nbs genes containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> collinear gene pairs between g. raimondii and g. barbadense, between g. arboreum and g. hirsutum, between g. raimondii and g. hirsutum, and between g. arboreum and g. barbadense, respectively .  <dig>  and  <dig>  nbs genes in g. raimondii were syntenic with that in g. barbadense and g. hirsutum respectively, while  <dig>  and  <dig>  nbs genes in g. arboretum were syntenic with that in g. hirsutum and g. barbadense, respectively. the results showed that more nbs genes in g. raimondii and g. arboreum were syntenic with that in g. barbadense and g. hirsutum respectively, indicating that the nbs genes between g. raimondii and g. barbadense, and between g. arboreum and g. hirsutum possessed closer evolution relationships, which was consistent with the results of similarity analysis and structural architectures analysis.fig.  <dig> synteny of nbs genes between the diploid and allotetraploid cotton. a collinear gene pairs between g. raimondii and g. barbadense. b collinear gene pairs of nbs genes between g. raimondii and g. hirsutum. c collinear gene pairs of nbs genes between g. arboreum and g. hirsutum. d collinear gene pairs of nbs genes between g. arboreum and g. barbadense





phylogenetic analysis of nbs-encoding genes containing tir domain
the amino acid sequences of the  <dig> nbs-encoding genes containing tir domain  from g. arboreum, g. raimondii, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense were aligned, and a phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree derived from nbs-encoding genes containing tir domain in g. arboreum, g. raimondii, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. the neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the sequences of  <dig> tir-nbs proteins in the four cotton species. bootstrap values were indicated on the branches. each nbs protein was labeled by its name . the filled circles, the hollow circles, the solid triangles and the hollow triangles represented the genes of g. arboreum, g. raimondii, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense, respectively




phylogenetic reconstruction of these tir-nbs genes showed that the genes from the same cotton species were not always clustered together, but often scattered in different clades . for example, the  <dig> tir-nbs genes from g. arboreum were distributed in separate clades and were distantly related with each other. this result indicated that tir-nbs genes among four cotton species were homologous. as shown in fig.  <dig>  ga044_a <dig> gene in g. arboreum, and gr115_d <dig>  gr116_d <dig>  gr117_d <dig> and gr118_d <dig> genes in g. raimondii shared a common ancestor. gr115_d <dig>  gr116_d <dig>  gr117_d <dig> and gr118_d <dig> genes belonged to a gene cluster , indicating that tandem duplications of tir-nbs genes occurred in g. raimondii after its divergence from g. arboreum. except gb434_scaffold <dig> and gb146_a <dig> which formed lone clades, the tir-nbs genes of g. barbadense were closely related with that of g. raimondii . for example, there were many sister genes between g. raimondii and g. barbadense, gb399_scaffold <dig> and gr123_d <dig> genes, gb469_scaffold <dig> and gr119_d <dig> genes, gb142_a <dig> and gr028_d <dig> genes and so on. this result indicated that g. barbadense inherited many tir-nbs genes from g. raimondii.


discussion
the nbs-encoding gene family is the largest disease resistance gene family in plants and has been studied in many important plant species, including arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , oryza sativa  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit> , zea mays  <cit> , and sorghum bicolor  <cit> . cotton is the most important textile fiber crop worldwide. verticillium wilt and fusarium wilt are the main threats to cotton production, and the immunity or resistance levels to the diseases differed among cotton species. little is known about the mechanisms of resistance to verticillium wilt and fusarium wilt. to date, no comprehensive and systematic research has been conducted on the nbs-encoding genes in the four important species of the genus gossypium. the present comparative study on genome-wide analysis of nbs-encoding genes in the four gossypium species provided new insights and useful information.

our bioinformatics analyses identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nbs-encoding genes in g. arboreum, g. raimondii, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense, respectively. a different number,  <dig> nbs-encoding genes identified from g. raimondii by wei et al.  <cit>  may be due to the different criterions and a few genes containing nbs domain may be filtered out by programming firstly the homology alignment of protein sequences between all genes in g. raimondii and  <dig> reference disease resistance genes selected from plant resistance gene database  <cit> . the numbers of nbs-encoding genes of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense were about two times of that of g. arboreum and g. raimondii, but their disease resistance were not always stronger than that of g. arboreum and g. raimondii. it is suggested that the total number of nbs-encoding genes in the genome is not the decisive factor for the disease resistance in cotton. for example, g. raimondii is more resistant to verticillium wilt than g. hirsutum , while g. arboreum is more resistant to fusarium wilt than g. barbadense  <cit> . through the analysis of some resistance gene analogues encoding nbs-lrr domains in cotton, khan et al. demonstrated that evolution and variation of nbs-lrr genes is one of the reasons for the susceptibility of g. hirsutum to the pathogens as compared to its donor parents  <cit> . the evolution and variation of nbs-encoding genes were selected for the survival of the allotetraploid cotton, so their resistances to different diseases were distinct. for example, g. barbadense usually is resistant or highly resistant to verticillium wilt, whereas g. hirsutum is susceptible ; g. barbadense is more susceptible to fusarium wilt than g. hirsutum  <cit> . in our analysis, the disease resistances of the allotetraploid cotton were more closely related to the preferential adoption and duplications of their nbs-encoding genes from one of the two diploid parents. thus, the comparative analysis of the proportions of different nbs type genes showed that g. arboreum and g. hirsutum had more nbs-encoding genes in common, while g. raimondii and g. barbadense had more nbs-encoding genes in common. for cn, cnl and n genes, the diploid g. arboreum had a greater proportion than the diploid g. raimondii, and the allotetraploid g. hirsutum had a greater proportion than the allotetraploid g. barbadense. opposite results were observed for the nl, tn and tnl genes. the proportions of rn and rnl genes remained relatively unchanged. exon statistics also showed that nbs genes in g. raimondii and g. barbadense generally possessed more exons than that in g. arboretum and g. hirsutum. therefore, g. hirsutum may inherit more nbs-encoding genes from g. arboreum, while g. barbadense may inherit more nbs-encoding genes from g. raimondii. we found large proportion percentage changes of tnl and tn genes within the two diploid species and within the two allotetraploid species, especially tnl genes, indicating that tnl genes may have a significant role in disease resistance in g. raimondii and g. hirsutum. li f et al. found similar differences in tnl and tn genes between g. arboreum and g. raimondii, and quantitative rt-pcr  analysis of the tnl and tn genes upon v. dahliae infection showed that there were different degrees of expression in the g. raimondii  <cit> .

our phylogenetic analysis of tnl and tn genes  revealed that the tir-nbs genes of g. barbadense were closely related to that of g. raimondii, and g. barbadense inherited many tir-nbs genes from g. raimondii. further similarity analysis of nbs-encoding genes in the four cotton species showed that g. arboreum had a larger proportion of nbs-encoding genes similar to that of g. hirsutum, and g. raimondii had a larger proportion of nbs-encoding genes similar to that of g. barbadense, indicating that g. hirsutum may inherit more nbs-encoding genes from g. arboreum, while g. barbadense may inherit more nbs-encoding genes from g. raimondii. the synteny analysis showed that more nbs genes in g. raimondii and g. arboreum were syntenic with that in g. barbadense and g. hirsutum respectively, indicating that the nbs genes between g. raimondii and g. barbadense, and between g. arboreum and g. hirsutum possessed closer evolution relationships. these results are consistent with the research reported by he l et al.  <cit> , zhang t et al.  <cit> , and liu x et al.  <cit> . he l et al. demonstrated that the distribution of resistance gene analogue  of g. hirsutum between the two sub-genomes a and d of cotton was uneven, with rga being more abundant in the a sub-genome than in the d sub-genome  <cit> . zhang t et al. found that structural rearrangements, gene loss, disrupted genes and sequence divergence of g. hirsutum were more common in the a sub-genome than in the d sub-genome  <cit> . liu x et al. revealed that a and d sub-genomes of g. barbadense had a high level of co-linearity with the g. raimondii genome  <cit> . the present comparative study of disease resistance in cotton also showed that g. raimondii and g. barbadense are immune or resistant to verticillium wilt, whereas g. arboreum and g. hirsutum are often susceptible to the wilt ; g. barbadense is often more susceptible to fusarium wilt than g. arboreum and g. hirsutum  <cit> . therefore, we propose that g. hirsutum inherited more nbs-encoding genes from g. arboreum, while g. barbadense inherited more nbs-encoding genes from g. raimondii, suggesting an asymmetric evolution of nbs-encoding genes. this will help to explain why g. raimondii and g. barbadense are similarly immune to verticillium wilt, whereas g. arboreum and g. hirsutum are both susceptible to the wilt. our study will help to reveal the mechanism of disease-resistance and promote the disease-resistant breeding to improve cotton disease resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
in all,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nbs-encoding genes were identified in g. arboreum, g. raimondii, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense, respectively. the nbs-encoding genes tended to form clusters on chromosomes. there were many commonality of structural architecture, synteny and amino acid sequence similarity of nbs-encoding genes between g. arboreum and g. hirsutum, and between g. raimondii and g. barbadense, indicating that g. hirsutum inherited more nbs-encoding genes from g. arboreum, while g. barbadense inherited more nbs-encoding genes from g. raimondii. this suggests asymmetric evolution of nbs-encoding genes in the two allotetraploid cotton species. the number of nbs-encoding genes is not the decisive factor of disease resistance in cotton, and the disease resistances of the allotetraploid cotton is related to the preferential adoption and duplication of their nbs-encoding genes from one of the two diploid parents. this will help to explain why g. raimondii and g. barbadense are similarly immune or resistant to verticillium wilt, whereas g. arboreum and g. hirsutum are similarly susceptible to the wilt, and the tnl genes may have a significant role in verticillium wilt resistance in g. raimondii and g. barbadense.
