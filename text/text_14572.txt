BACKGROUND
among the rigorous methods of tree reconstruction that are available, maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference  have dominated phylogenetic studies in recent years  <cit> . both methods are based on the likelihood function, which needs explicit models of evolution to capture the underlying evolutionary processes in sequence data  <cit> . for dna sequences, the models are the evolutionary characterisation of one nucleotide being replaced by another one. although the models are simplifications of the "true" evolutionary processes and are clearly wrong  <cit> , they are approximations that have been widely accepted. the assumed model of nucleotide substitution can exert a significant influence on phylogenetic estimation. this is an increasingly important concern in the modern genomic era, with the growing use of multiple loci that have probably been subject to different substitution processes  <cit> .

a variety of nucleotide substitution models have been devised, most of which are special cases of the general time-reversible  model in which each of the six pairwise nucleotide changes can have a distinct rate, and the frequencies of the four nucleotides are allowed to take different values  <cit> . common extensions to this model include parameters for a proportion of invariable sites  and for gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity among sites . in the last few years, many improvements have been explored, including models that account for differences among the three codon positions  <cit> , pattern heterogeneity of the substitution process , among-site heterogeneity of rates , compositional heterogeneity among lineages , and site-specific rate variation through time .

statistical methods are often used to identify the substitution model that best describes the given dna sequence data. model selection using software such as modeltest  <cit> , dt-modsel  <cit> , and jmodeltest  <cit>  has now become standard procedure in phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . alternatively, model determination can be conducted using a reversible-jump markov chain monte carlo approach in a bayesian setting  <cit> . this differs from past practice when model choice was conducted without statistical justification or by choosing the most parameter-rich model available  <cit> . model selection is considered important because the use of alternative models can change the results of phylogenetic analysis. it has effects not only on the estimation of model parameters , but also on estimates of bootstrap support and posterior probabilities  <cit> . furthermore, misspecified models can lead to errors in phylogenetic inference, especially for trees with short internal branches  <cit> .

one of the challenges facing researchers is how to select the most appropriate substitution model for a given dataset. there is now a range of procedures from which to choose, including the hierarchical likelihood-ratio test   <cit> , akaike information criterion   <cit> , bayes factor  <cit> , bayesian information criterion   <cit> , posterior probability  <cit> , decision theory   <cit> , and the emerging approach of cross-validation  <cit> . all of these can be used to select the best-fit model from a set of candidates, but differ in specific algorithms which may ultimately give rise to differences in their performance .

of the four widely-used model-selection criteria in phylogenetics - the hlrt, aic, bic, and dt - the hlrt was once argued to be reasonably accurate and to perform better in general than the aic and bic, a conclusion drawn from analyses of simulated data comparing six models  <cit> . however, the hlrt has been demonstrated to have several disadvantages, such as a dependence on the starting point and the path through the hierarchy of models  <cit> , which undermine and limit its performance in model selection. it has been established that both the bic and dt tend to select simpler models than the aic  <cit> , while the hlrt particularly favours complex ones  <cit> . applying them to empirical data, pol  <cit>  found that different best-fit models were selected by the hlrt and aic for  <dig> out of  <dig> datasets. ripplinger and sullivan  <cit>  found that the hlrt, aic, bic, and dt criteria often selected different models for the same real datasets, which was similar to the results of abdo et al.  <cit>  based on simulated data using parameters estimated from a rodent mtdna dataset; in contrast, several empirical studies found that the bic and dt often selected the same model  <cit> . however, there is a need for a comprehensive systematic study of the performance of model-selection criteria.

here we present a study of the performance of the four model-selection criteria hlrt, aic, bic, and dt. considering the biases in model selection revealed by previous studies  and the convenience of simulated data for theoretical investigation  <cit> , we conducted a total of  <dig> simulations of  <dig>  datasets. our investigation was limited to the  <dig> fundamental substitution models from the gtr family, assuming a stationary, time-reversible, and homogeneous markov process. based on the best-fit models selected by these criteria for these simulated datasets, we examined for each criterion the success rate of recovering simulated models  and the number of different models selected across replicate datasets ; the dissimilarity and model biases of these criteria  were also examined and compared statistically. in addition, we examined dissimilarity in analyses of datasets that were simulated under a slightly more complex model based on a simple homogeneous codon-substitution process. on the whole, our study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of model-selection criteria.

RESULTS
accuracy
in the  <dig> simulations , the mean accuracy scores for the bic and dt were higher than those for the hlrt and aic. the anova-lsd tests demonstrated that there were no significant differences for the pairs of hlrt-aic and bic-dt respectively; however, very significant differences existed for the other pairs such as hlrt-bic . the full results of the accuracy analysis are provided in additional file  <dig> 

one hundred replicates were performed for each set of conditions. the models consisted of jc   <cit> , k <dig>   <cit> , sym   <cit> , f <dig>   <cit> , hky   <cit> , gtr   <cit> , jc + i , k <dig> + i , sym + i , f <dig> + i , hky + i , gtr + i , jc + Γ , k <dig> + Γ , sym + Γ , f <dig> + Γ , hky + Γ , gtr + Γ , jc + i + Γ , k <dig> + i + Γ , sym + i + Γ , f <dig> + i + Γ , hky + i + Γ  and gtr + i + Γ , where 'i' represents the proportion of invariable sites, 'Γ' represents the discrete gamma distribution with four rate categories, and number in parentheses is the number of free parameters of each model. one classification of the  <dig> models was to put them into four categories: base , base + i , base + Γ  and base + i + Γ . the other was that models with the same number of free parameters were grouped together, resulting in a total of  <dig> categories. in addition, we called every four models having the same parameters in the substitution-rate matrix as base-like models .

the hlrt exhibited high accuracy in recovering some models, but unexpectedly, it was always incapable of recovering the four sym-like models  . the aic showed moderate or low accuracy except for a few complex models  for which the accuracy was even as high as  <dig>  in certain simulations. the accuracy of the bic and dt differed among simulations. in most cases, they showed high accuracy in recovering almost all of the  <dig> models . compared with the other models, however, two  were only moderately recovered in simulations derived from parameter set-b; even all of the sym-like and gtr-like models were recovered less frequently in simulation i- <dig>  . the bic and dt exhibited similar accuracy in simulation i- <dig>  and simulation iv- <dig> , both recovering less than 35% of models of base + i + Γ category  . in fact, they always selected models of base + Γ category . their accuracy values were high when the value of the parameter for proportion of invariable sites  was altered from  <dig>  in parameter set-a to  <dig>  in parameter set-b when simulating datasets . notably, the hlrt and aic in these two simulations, especially the former criterion, also showed lower accuracy in recovering models of base + i + Γ category than in the other simulations.

precision
there were very significant differences among the precisions of the four criteria in the  <dig> simulations . the precision of the hlrt was very significantly different from that of bic and dt in certain simulations , but not in others, while the precision of aic was very significantly different from that of the other three criteria  in all  <dig> simulations. the precision of bic was always similar to that of dt, with p-values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the full results of the analyses of precision are provided in additional file  <dig> 

although small discrepancies existed, precision values of the aic were generally higher than those of the other three in the  <dig> simulations . their means ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , while standard deviations were also much larger and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . this was mainly attributed to the fact that the aic usually selected a dozen different best-fit models for each set of  <dig> replicates simulated under the same conditions, but at the same time, it selected only a few for datasets simulated under sym-like and gtr-like models. compared with the aic, the other three criteria selected fewer different best-fit models, and their precision values were relatively stable among datasets generated under the same simulation conditions. however, precision values of the hlrt  were generally higher than those of the bic and dt, and in some cases were very significantly different. therefore, the bic and dt exhibited the best precision among the four criteria - lower mean and smaller standard deviation - while that of the bic was little better than that of dt .

dissimilarity
the percentages of one same model, two models, three models and four models being selected within each set of  <dig> replicate datasets were summarised, and table  <dig> shows their means in each of the  <dig> simulations . it was clear that two different best-fit models were generally estimated the most frequently by these criteria, with means ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, followed by one same model from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, and three models from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. four different models were favoured less than  <dig> % by these four criteria in the  <dig> simulations, and even zero in i- <dig>  iv- <dig>  and v- <dig> 

simulation
due to rounding, the four numerical values in some simulations do not sum exactly to 100%.

in the additional simulation vi, which was performed using complex codon models, means of percentages that one same model, two models, three models, and four models were selected were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. among the criterion pairs, means of dissimilarity values ranged from  <dig> % for bic-dt to  <dig> % for hlrt-aic, and dissimilarity of bic-dt was significantly different from that of the other criterion pairs .

model biases
while considering the four model categories , the results of the chi-square  homogeneity tests  <cit>  demonstrated that there were significant differences in model biases among the four criteria  . the hlrt was always significantly different from the other three , with a relatively small portion of base + i category recovered in the  <dig> simulations . in contrast, the bic was always similar to dt with high probabilities except in simulation i- <dig>  where dt recovered fewer models of base category. for comparisons between the aic and bic, and between the aic and dt, differences were generally not significant in simulations other than i- <dig>  iv- <dig>  and i- <dig>  in fact, there was an even or an approximately even distribution of model categories recovered by the aic, bic, and dt in these simulations; but for i- <dig> and iv- <dig>  models of base + i + Γ category were recovered much less by the bic and dt than the other model categories .

simulation
the  <dig> models were classified into four categories: base, base + i, base + Γ, and base + i + Γ in these tests.

discussion
which is the best criterion for model selection?
although there exist cases indicating that obvious violation of model assumptions could favour the true tree  <cit>  under specific conditions , it has been clearly demonstrated that identifying the best-fit model is beneficial to phylogenetic inference and to understanding the molecular-evolutionary process. it must be acknowledged, however, that an absolute characterisation of the true evolutionary history of real data is usually impossible. so one concern for researchers, who do not have knowledge of this evolutionary history, is the accuracy of model-selection criteria to ensure that the best model can be selected from the available candidates.

in this study, based on  <dig> simulations of  <dig>  datasets performed using known models, we simply evaluated the accuracy and precision of four model-selection criteria. higher accuracy was broadly coincident with better precision and vice versa, which the performance of aic best explained. nevertheless, there were exceptions to this general pattern. since the hlrt always selected gtr-like and trn-like models for datasets simulated using sym-like models, its precision values were low and its accuracy was almost zero. generally, the high accuracy and low precision of the bic and dt indicate that they perform better than the other two criteria. this result is robust to the influences of different simulation programs , tree topologies comprising different numbers of taxa , and sequence lengths  . however, accuracy values in certain simulations may confuse the situation to some extent, due to different simulation conditions as described below.

 <dig>  parameters
between simulations derived from parameter set-a and those derived from set-b, discrepancies in performance existed for both the bic and dt  . considering that altering pinv from  <dig>  in simulation i- <dig> and iv- <dig> to  <dig>  can improve the recovery of models of base + i + Γ category by the bic and dt, pinv should be an important parameter influencing accuracy.

 <dig>  tree topology
the accuracy of the bic and dt in simulations with a tree height of  <dig>  did not support the general conclusions very well, being different from the simulations using tree heights of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . at the same time, this happened in the simulation with the non-clock tree topology with both short and long branches. given the lower accuracy of the other two criteria in these two simulations, we suspect that model selection might not be very effective for data of limited information content.

do they select different best-fit models?
our study revealed that the means of dissimilarity values of the hlrt-aic pair ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, and were the largest across the  <dig> simulations even though they were not necessarily statistically larger than those of the other pairs. in contrast, the bic and dt tended to select the same model, with significantly lower means of dissimilarity values ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % across the  <dig> simulations. model selection for datasets simulated under complex codon models also yielded the largest dissimilarity for hlrt-aic and the smallest for bic-dt. thus, we can envisage that researchers using the hlrt and aic would frequently face a problematic situation in which these criteria would select different models. at the same time, as an extension of the bic incorporating branch-length error  <cit> , dt brings doubt as to whether estimating branch-length error, a measure of phylogenetic performance, would influence model selection.

on the whole, if one uses these four criteria to select models for given sequence data, variance in best-fit models could be encountered with the greatest possibility of two different models, followed by moderate possibilities of one same model, and three models; there is little or no chance of encountering four different best-fit models. these results are generally consistent with those of ripplinger and sullivan  <cit> , whose results were based on  <dig> real sequence datasets for the criteria of hlrt, aic, bic, and dt. however, the results of our additional simulation vi supported a different order: two models, three models, one same model, and four models. in all respects, results of both empirical studies  <cit>  and simulation studies  suggest that model selection with these criteria will often produce inconsistent models, which could present a confusing situation for researchers.

are there model biases?
when considering the four model categories, one unexpected discovery was the relatively small portion of base + i category recovered in the  <dig> simulations, including those simulated with the pinv of  <dig>  in parameter set-b. this result indicates that model selection with the hlrt is not sensitive to the proportion of invariable sites under the condition that there is no other among-site rate heterogeneity. in comparison, there was an approximately even distribution of the four model categories by the aic, bic, and dt in most simulations , which is consistent with the ideal even distribution given that the number of datasets simulated under models of any one category  is the same as that of any other category. in a sense, we could relate the typical insensitivity of the hlrt to the proportion of variable sites with its special hierarchy of pairwise comparisons, because this parameter is the last-optimised parameter in the default hierarchy of modeltest v. <dig>   <cit> . as it has been demonstrated that the hierarchy has an influence on the performance of hlrt  <cit> , future work could investigate whether different hierarchies might lead to a different success rate in recovering models of base + i category.

nevertheless, with our two standards of classifying the  <dig> gtr-family models, the results all confirmed that the bic exhibited similar model biases to dt, with only a few exceptions. this was consistent with the results of accuracy, precision, and dissimilarity, which to some extent demonstrated that results based on our simulated datasets were reasonable and consistent.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our performance analysis based on simulated datasets indicates that the bic together with dt should be preferred for model selection in phylogenetics, although some of our results departed from this general finding owing to specific simulation settings such as values of the proportion of invariable sites. however, in view of the improvements on gtr models explored in recent years , it is possible that the results from most of our simulated data represent a poor reflection of real sequence data, which have almost certainly evolved under more complex conditions. accordingly, we suggest here that model selection by the bic or dt, together with model adequacy tests by parametric bootstrap  <cit>  or posterior predictive distributions  <cit> , might be the best approach. further studies can be done with simulated datasets under more complex evolutionary models to understand the performance of these criteria and to enhance phylogenetic studies.
