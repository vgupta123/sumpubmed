BACKGROUND
we live in the era of the genome-wide association study . large numbers of samples have been collected and genotyped in a bid to associate single nucleotide polymorphisms  with phenotypic variation. in the context of human disease, the design of such studies and, in particular, the so-called snp-chip technology that underpins them, has aimed to exploit the common disease, common variant hypothesis ,  <cit> . this assumes that common diseases will frequently be associated with common  variants.

there is now a long history of gwas studies, and large numbers of variants have been found to be associated with disease  <cit> . however, such studies do not come without financial cost, and there has also been a lively discussions regarding whether such a track record should be regarded as a success or failure  <cit> . our purpose here is not to add to that discussion, but rather to focus on what will often be a frequent ‘next step’ in such studies.

while it is undeniable that gwas has uncovered large numbers of variants that are associated with disease, it has also become clear that, while these variants do appear to be associated with disease, they can only explain a fraction of the phenotypic variation that is observed. unfortunately, this fraction is general very low ,  <cit> ; but see, also,  <cit> . such demonstrations of missing heritability have lead to some skepticism about the common disease, common variant hypothesis .

there are many possible explanations for missing heritability ,  <cit>  for discussions. these include rare variants, complex genetic architectures, structural variation such as copy number variation, the joint effects of large numbers of variants each of small effect marginally, and so-called phantom heritability ,  <cit> . in this paper we focus on the first of those hypotheses: the discovery of nearby, and possibly rare variants that drive gwas signals.

because of their focus on common variants, snp-chip platforms were not well placed to discover associations between disease and rare genetic variants. theoretically, discovery through so-called synthetic associations with common variants is possible  <cit> , although we note that there is some discussion regarding whether such phenomena are likely to explain most gwas signals ,  <cit> . however, given this possibility, combined with the recognition that an initial gwas may well be finding snps that are not causative in themselves, but are instead linked with nearby causative polymorphisms, there has been a move towards following-up gwas studies by sequencing studies ,  <cit> . here, the hope is that a signal of association that has been found in gwas can be refined, and strengthened, by sequencing the region of the genome that surrounds the focal snp . alternative strategies, that are not the subject of the present paper, include whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing   <cit> .

however, before such a sequencing study can be conducted, several design questions must be resolved . with this in mind, nih formed the gwaseq consortium, in which multiple groups were funded to conduct sequence-based follow-up to gwas, and thereby create a pool of publically-available data that could both a) provide the potential for refinement of gwas signal for the phenotypes of interest, and b) provide a publically-available resource that the wider community might use to help guide their approach to such design questions for their own studies. the study we describe in this paper is one member of the gwaseq consortium. as such, the data are in the process of being made publically available through dbgap, the ncbi’s repository for data that attempt to relate genotype to phenotype .

it should be noted, of course, that a large number of studies outside the gwaseq consortium are also attempting to follow-up gwas hits using ngs technology, and examples are beginning to appear. an early example of this is nejentsev et al.  <cit> , in which the authors sequenced exons and splice-sites for ten candidate genes that contained previously associated common snps for type- <dig> diabetes in order to identify rare functional variants. likewise, there are also a growing number of exome-sequencing studies, e.g. liu, et al.  <cit> , that focus on testing for rare functional variants.

our study focuses on colorectal cancer. colorectal cancer is the fourth-most common cancer and the second-most common cause of cancer death in the united states, with approximately  <dig>  new cases and  <dig>  deaths estimated in  <dig>  <cit> . there is known to be a strong genetic component to crc risk, and individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer are at increased risk of the disease. for example, having a first-degree relative with crc roughly doubles the risk,  <cit> . further evidence of heritability is seen in twin studies. for example, in a large twin study, up to 35 %  of crc risk could be explained by inherited factors  <cit> . gwas hits have been found in a number of regions: 8q <dig>  , 8q <dig>  , 9p <dig>   <cit> , 8q <dig>   and 10p <dig>   <cit> , 11q <dig>   <cit> , 12q <dig>  , 14q <dig>  , 15q <dig>    <cit> , 18q <dig>   <cit> , and 20q <dig>  . it is these regions that form the basis for follow-up in our experimental design.

our data consist of samples from the colon cancer family registry   <cit> . the ccfr includes data and biospecimens from over  <dig>  total subjects . the consortium consists of six research institutions. in the present study we include germ-line samples from  <dig> of those centers . a total of  <dig>  samples were sequenced. a sub-set of these samples consisted of pedigree-based samples  – these do not form part of the analysis described in this paper. after a variety of quality control checks , we conducted our analyses using  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls.table  <dig> sample information for all samples sequenced in this study

both population based and pedigree based samples were included in the sequencing. the majority of samples were sequenced from genomic dna extracted from stored blood, with a sub-set of samples that were sequenced from stored buccal swabs



RESULTS
sequencing
our samples were sequenced at the baylor college of medicine  sequencing center. in all,  <dig>  samples were successfully sequenced and passed all of the bcm’s internal quality controls. an overview of the sequencing results is presented in table  <dig>  for each sample, approximately  <dig>  mb of the genome was sequenced to an average depth of 76x . to explore how well each targeted region was covered by the sequencing we calculated the breadth of coverage across each targeted region. on average, approximately 80 % of the targeted regions were covered at 30x or greater . the distribution of coverage was similar among all the targeted regions except for the 20q <dig>  region. we originally suspected that the differences in the observed coverage for this region might be due to structural variation affecting mapping, but after closer inspection we did not detect any large-scale structural variation in this region. rather, it is the case that a subset of our samples appears to have lower coverage over all regions, and, for reasons that are unclear, this effect appears to be magnified for the 20q <dig>  region. there is no evidence of differential coverage rates between cases and controls .table  <dig> summary of  <dig> genomic regions sequenced

the first column indicates the focal gwas snp that the region was designed around. sequencing coverage for each region was calculated as the mean coverage across the entire targeted region and as the breadth of coverage. the breadth of coverage is defined as the number of bases per targeted region that are coverage at > = 30x coverage

variant calls
we identified a total of  <dig>  polymorphic sites in the  <dig>  samples. of these sites,  <dig>  were found to be novel  and had not been previously identified in either dbsnp  or as part of the  <dig> genomes project . after filtering , we retained  <dig>   of the originally identified polymorphic sites. for the non-novel variants, we compared ‘consistency' of our variant calls with those of the  <dig> genomes project. specifically, we checked whether the variant allele observed in our data was the same as that seen in the  <dig> genomes data. the consistency between our raw and filtered variant call sets compared with  <dig> genomes data was ~ <dig>  % for both call sets. this similarity in consistency between our raw and filtered call sets is reflective of the fact that both call sets accurately detected the more “common” variant sites from the  <dig> genomes data set. the vast majority  of variants identified in this study have a maf < =  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> distribution of allele s with a maf of less than  <dig>  for the  <dig>  population based samples



sample qc
overall call rates and concordance between genotypes identified in the sequence data as compared to genotypes called from previously collected snp array data  was high. we identified  <dig> samples where the concordance between the sequence-based genotype calls and one or more array-based genotype calls was low and therefore we removed those samples from the analysis. given the high concordance between our sequence-based genotype calls and the array-based genotype calls we believe that the number of mis-identified or mis-labeled samples in our final data set is negligible.

the logistical constraints of this study, in which data was shipped from a variety of centers at a variety of times, and sequencing was necessarily performed in batches at a third-party center, meant that we were not able to explicitly design the study to guard against batch or center effects during sequencing. however, we carefully examined the sequence data for batch and center effects and found none. we saw no evidence of any clustering by center in pc plots, nor variation in coverage by center. we also examined snp density, π, for each center and means were very similar .

in addition, we performed a principal component analysis to identify other apparent sample outliers. we removed  <dig> samples that were revealed as outliers by plotting data on pc axes  and then recalculated pc axes based on the remaining samples.fig.  <dig>

association tests
in this paper we focus upon testing for association in the population-based samples that passed the preceding qc checks . analysis of the family-based data is ongoing and will be presented in a separate paper.

population structure and candidate region studies
it is traditional to control for population structure in a gwas context. in order to do this, global genome-wide structure and relatedness between samples is evaluated using a genome-wide set of  markers. in the present study, which amounts to a study of  <dig> candidate regions, this is impossible. while we chose to calculate pcs as part of the qc process, to uncover obvious outliers, it is entirely unclear that such pcs will reliably capture genome-wide patterns of relatedness. neither do we have ‘snp-chip’ data for every sample in our data. we have a total of just ~  <dig>  mb of data per sample, divided into  <dig> short  regions. as such, we believe it is likely that pcs calculated form this data may capture local, rather than global structure. indeed we see no correspondence between pcs calculated on the samples retained for the association analysis and ethnicity or center of collection. we also note that the first pc explains <4 % of the variation in the sample. this lack of structure is consistent with the vast majority  of our samples being comprised of caucasian individuals, and is further consistent with the structure that is observed in earlier gwas analyses using ccfr samples and common snps.

for this reason, while for comparison’s sake, we present results for analyses that include both  <dig> and  <dig> pcs, we propose to focus on the results for the analysis containing  <dig> pcs. we return to this point in the next section.

 variant associations
as a reflection of the reduction of power to detect associations as variant maf decreases, we focus our marginal tests of association on variants with maf >  <dig> . this results in us testing a total of  <dig>  variant positions. we identified  <dig> variants  distributed among six of the targeted regions at a fdr significance level of  <dig>  . eight of the  <dig> variants were novel to this study. all of these variants were located in non-coding regions of the genome. of the  <dig> variants,  <dig> were located in the intronic regions of the genes kiaa <dig>  cers <dig>  tmprss <dig>  fmn <dig>  ctif and loxhd <dig>  the remaining  <dig> variants were located in the intergenic regions between genes linc <dig> and linc <dig>  bmp <dig> and cdkn <dig>  and sgg <dig> and grem <dig> . detailed regional plots for the above significant associations and all regions tested are presented in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> most significantly associated snps identified in the plink analysis



we note that we see no evidence of overall inflation of p-value across our regions, despite our choice not to include pcs, or to include just  <dig> pcs, in the association test . rather we see p-value that are distributed as expected under the null, with the exception of an excess of small p-value, which is what one would hope to see in a study such as ours in which we are following–up on putative hits from earlier studies .fig.  <dig> qq-plot for marginal associations between common polymorphism and cancer status across all sequenced regions. x-axis shows expected –log; y-axis shows observed –log



it is of particular interest to examine the strength of association found with each of the ‘focal’ snps around which the  <dig> regions we defined. this is recorded in the final two columns of table  <dig>  . we note that, with the exception of rs <dig> and rs <dig> we see a strong tendency for these tests of association to return small p-value. this is, at the very least, encouraging regarding the veracity of those original signals.

rare variant associations
to test for associations with rare variants  we first annotated the genomic locations of all variants in our call set into either exonic, intronic, intergenic, upstream 1 kb or downstream 1 kb of a known gene, utrs, or non-coding rnas categories. based on these classifications we defined  <dig> variant sets that were used to test for associations using the skat combined test  <cit> . we identified two variant sets  that showed a significant association after correcting for multiple tests. the two significant variant sets were the 3′ utr of the gene c11orf <dig>  and the 5′ utr region of the gene atf <dig> .table  <dig> composition of the significantly associated snp sets identified in the skat combined analysis



we then performed skat tests for each individual targeted region  separately and conditioned on the original focal gwas snp. the single resulting significant variant set is the 5′ utr of atf <dig>  . the c11orf <dig> variant set was no longer significant once the focal gwas snp was added into the analysis as a covariate.table  <dig> composition of the significantly associated snp sets identified in the skat combined analysis

this analysis was performed on each targeted sequencing region separately and including the focal gwas snp as a covariates



discussion
here we present a large-scale data set that we hope will serve as a powerful resource to investigate ways to design a successful strategy for using next-generation sequencing technologies to follow up on gwas. given that a gwas has been preformed and significant associations have identified suspected regions, targeted re-sequencing provides a powerful method to further investigate the fine-scale genomic structure in these regions. however, there are few guidelines as to how such a follow-up study should be performed. for example, design issues include, but are not limited to, the following:which samples should be sequenced?

which regions should be sequenced?

what depth of coverage should be used and how far around the focal snp should we sequence?

to what extent can we rely upon imputation?

what designs are more efficient for variant discovery and testing associations?



there are at least two ways one could try to answer design questions such as this. the first is to conduct a large simulation study. here, data are simulated under a variety of possible disease models, and for a variety of population models and designs for gwas and subsequent sequencing study. a very large number of variables are at play here, but the advantage of a simulation-based study is that it is possible, at least in principle, to simulate a wide variety of possibilities. the disadvantage, of course, is that the conclusions one draws may or may not be robust to inaccuracies in the underlying simulation model. as was famously noted by george box, “all models are wrong; some are useful”  <cit> . the hope is that the conclusions drawn from such an analysis will be useful despite their inevitable  inaccuracies. such studies are extremely computationally intensive, which limits the range of model and design parameters that might be considered, but examples do exist. for example,  <cit>  conducted such an analysis based upon simulating populations of  <dig>  genotypes designed to mimic a breast cancer study  <cit> . they demonstrated that informative sampling based on disease and phenotype status jointly, could improve power, as could incorporating phenotype data from extended pedigree information, in family-based studies.

the second approach to resolving these design questions is data- rather than simulation-based. here the goal is to collect data in which sequencing has been used to follow-up gwas hits, and to attempt to draw robust conclusions from those data. now, as box might say, the ‘model’ is correct. the data got there however disease data got there . however, the price we pay here is lack of replication - we have a relatively small number of such datasets. therefore, the challenge will be in drawing robust conclusions from these studies. our hope is that the data resource described by this paper, and other members of the gwaseq consortium, will help begin to provide those guidelines.

one perspective of the gwaseq consortium is to provide data that are rich enough to enable investigators to assess the effectiveness of alternative designs by subsetting the available data. given this view, the goal we followed when designing the study was to be conservative in the sense of sequencing at greater depth, for wider regions and more samples, than might otherwise have been the case. this provides maximum scope for assessment of efficiency of alternative designs.

for the  <dig>  individuals included in this study we were able to successfully sequence the majority  of the intended target region surrounding the gwas implicated snp of interest to a sufficient depth to allow us to accurately genotype previously unknown variants in the region. of the variants we identified, the vast majority  of snps in our data set are comprised of rare variants with a maf of less than  <dig> . this abundance of rare variants is consistent with the findings of other large-scale sequencing projects that have shown very high levels of genetic diversity present in the human population, driven by recent and rapid population expansion  <cit> .

of course, a primary interest when collecting data such as these is to determine whether stronger genotype-phenotype associations will be found near the focal snps from prior gwas. here, we employed two strategies to detect associations and identify variants that confer risk for colorectal cancer susceptibility. the first strategy focused on more “common” variants to determine if any of the higher allele frequency novel variants identified in this data set could be associated with disease susceptibility. this strategy identified  <dig> new variants, none of which have been previously associated with colorectal cancer. the second strategy we employed was to look at the combined effect of rare and common variants. here we uncovered associations with distinct variant sets containing both common and rare variants in the 3′utr of the gene c11orf <dig>  and the 5′utr of the gene atf <dig> 

previous work to identify the functional risk variants for colorectal cancer in the 11q <dig>  region has implicated several genes including c11orf <dig> as likely factors in colorectal cancer etiology  <cit> . furthermore, pittman et al.  <cit>  found a variant  in the 3′utr of c11orf <dig> to be in high ld with snp rs <dig>  which was the focal gwas snp that our sequencing region was designed around. while we did not detect a significant association with rs <dig>  the skat combined test did identify three other variants in the same 190 bp region that comprises the 3′utr of c11orf <dig>  the 3′utr contributes to post transcriptional gene regulation through the regulatory actions of mirnas. if differences in c11orf <dig> expression are involved in colorectal cancer susceptibility, then mutations in the 3′utr might lead to changes in mirna binding affinity and thus lead to changes in the expression of that gene. in fact, rs <dig> is directly adjacent to a mir- <dig> binding sequence .

additionally, we detected a significant  enrichment of novel variants in cases as compared to controls within the 5′utr region of the activating transcription factor  <dig>  gene, an important camp-responsive transcription factor. two of these novel variant positions lie within an upstream open reading frame , and three of them lie within the internal ribosome entry site   <cit> . both uorfs and ires elements contribute to overall gene expression levels via translation control  <cit> . in  <dig>  huang, et al.  <cit>  showed that expression levels of atf <dig> are positively correlated with survival in colorectal cancer patients.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is likely to be one of a large number of studies that perform targeted sequencing in order to follow-up hits from earlier gwas. the jury is still out regarding how likely it is that stronger associations will be uncovered by such a strategy, but heritability estimates for many diseases indicate that this is a reasonable hope. in our own study we do find such associations in a number of the regions that we sequenced. however, it is also the case that in a number of the regions no significant signal was found. regardless, by placing such data in the public domain we hope to enable other groups to better design their own follow-up studies, and thereby increase their own chances of successful discovery.
