BACKGROUND
freezing is an adverse abiotic factor with severe negative impacts on plant health and productivity  <cit> . most temperate plants can increase their freezing tolerance after exposure to low temperatures, a process called cold acclimation . cbf/dreb <dig> genes play a key role in the regulation of the transcriptome during cold acclimation  <cit> . they belong to the ap2/erebp family of transcription factors and were first isolated from arabidopsis thaliana  heynh. . up to now, cbf/dreb <dig> genes have been identified in numerous herbaceous and woody plant species  and different studies have reported their significant role in freezing tolerance .

grain legumes are an important source of food and feed worldwide. with their seeds containing 20% to 30% protein, they largely contribute to the protein requirements of humans and animals  <cit> . forage legumes are a valuable source of protein, fiber and energy for livestock as well  <cit> . besides their nutritional importance, legumes are an exceptional component to sustainable agriculture. in fact, most legume species are able to establish nitrogen-fixing symbioses with rhizobial bacteria  <cit>  which reduces the need for fertilizer application in crop rotation systems. nowadays, the susceptibility to low temperatures and freezing conditions still represents a major constraint to the cultivation of legumes in many agro-ecological zones. the identification of the genes responsible for the natural freezing tolerance variation can enhance the breeding progress and subsequently the release of novel freezing-tolerant cultivars.

medicago truncatula is an annual legume of mediterranean origin  <cit> . it is not only a valuable forage crop as in southern australia  <cit>  but has been chosen as a model molecular-genetic system for legume biology  <cit> . a large array of genomic tools has been developed for the reference accession a <dig>  <cit>  and a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of its genome comprising approximately 94% of all genes has been released  <cit> . these resources can accelerate the identification of the molecular determinants of various traits in m. truncatula including freezing tolerance. knowledge can be then transferred to different agronomically and economically important crops considering their phylogenetic closeness to m. truncatula and the remarkable synteny between their genomes and that of m. truncatula.

studies on cold acclimation and freezing tolerance in m. truncatula are scarce . few biochemical changes have been reported in response to low non-freezing temperatures for this species  <cit> . at the molecular level, transcripts corresponding to m. truncatula cold acclimation-specific gene  <dig>  a candidate cbf/dreb <dig> target, have been found to accumulate 6 hours after exposure to low temperature  <cit> . four cbf/dreb <dig> genes, i.e. mtcbf1- <dig>  have been reported to be rapidly induced in response to cold stress  <cit> . furthermore, the overexpression of mtcbf <dig>  has been shown to improve the freezing tolerance of transgenic m. truncatula accession jemalong  <cit> . mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> are located on m. truncatula chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, but no information on the physical localization of mtcbf2- <dig> has yet been obtained. apart from mtcbf1- <dig>  no other cbf/dreb <dig> genes have been described and characterized from m. truncatula even though expressed sequence tag  and complementary dna  potentially representing transcripts from other putative cbf/dreb <dig> genes are available  <cit> .

recently, avia et al.  <cit>  have uncovered natural variation for freezing tolerance among  <dig> m. truncatula accessions after a cold acclimation period. the genetic bases for freezing tolerance variation between the contrasted accessions f83005- <dig> and dza045- <dig> have been identified using a quantitative trait locus  mapping approach  <cit> . a major freezing tolerance qtl  accounting for 40% of the phenotypic variation has been mapped to a region of m. truncatula chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  coinciding with an assembly gap in the a <dig> euchromatic sequence  <cit> . the present study aimed to fine map mt-ftqtl <dig> and to identify genes located in the corresponding genomic region.

RESULTS
freezing tolerance evaluation of recombinant lines validates mt-ftqtl <dig> position and narrows down its confidence interval
eighteen f <dig> or f <dig> lines were evaluated for freezing tolerance after a cold acclimation period . based on markers used in this study , screened lines correspond to  <dig> different haplotypes;  <dig> of which carry recombination events within or next to mt-ftqtl <dig> confidence interval . phenotypic data from f83005- <dig> and dza045- <dig>  included as check plants, were significantly different as expected. comparisons of the phenotypes and marker genotypes validated mt-ftqtl <dig> confidence interval previously located between markers nt <dig> and nt <dig>  <cit> . freezing damage scores from the self-pollinated progenies of lines 76-08- <dig> and 76-06-187- <dig> showed that f83005- <dig> inserts upstream nt <dig> have no phenotypic effect. the same conclusion was reached concerning f83005- <dig> inserts downstream nt <dig> based on the progenies of line 76-05- <dig>  furthermore, mt-ftqtl <dig> interval could be delineated to a smaller region of  <dig>  cm between markers mtic <dig> and nt <dig> . a critical recombination event in line 76-02- <dig>  as seen in lines 76-02-86- <dig> and 76-02-86- <dig>  suggested mtic <dig> as the left marker for mt-ftqtl <dig> confidence interval. the right marker, nt <dig>  was identified based on information from the progenies of lines 76-09- <dig> and 76-11-108- <dig> figure  <dig> 
phenotypic evaluation of different haplotypes carrying or not recombination events within/next to the confidence interval of mt-ftqtl <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> seedlings were obtained from the self-pollination of the homozygous f <dig> and f <dig> lines whose code names are indicated in the ‘mother plant identifier’ column. these lines originally derive from a cross between m. truncatula accessions f83005- <dig>  and dza045- <dig>  . the genotypes of f7/f <dig> lines at mt-ftqtl <dig> are provided based on information from  <dig> markers that are shown according to their established genetic and/or physical order . green bars refer to chromosomal regions harboring alleles from f83005- <dig>  orange dotted bars represent regions with alleles from dza045- <dig>  markers bordering the confidence interval of mt-ftqtl <dig> according to  <cit>  are underlined. these are  <dig>  cm distant  <cit> . haplotype groups a-i contain the recombinant and non-recombinant f7/f <dig> lines that were compared between each other. the mean freezing damage score  of each line is provided in the ‘freezing tolerance assessment’ part of this figure. pairwise comparisons of mean fds were conducted between recombinant lines, respective controls , f83005- <dig> and dza045- <dig> . letters  and  are used to distinguish significantly different fds in each haplotype group. due to the lack of individuals representing the parental accessions, the mean fds of the progeny of recombinant line 76-11-108- <dig> in group i was only compared with those of the progenies of 76-11-108- <dig> and 76-11-51- <dig>  considered as positive and negative controls respectively. deduced phenotypes of f7/f <dig> lines are indicated to the right of the figure: ‘s’, sensitive to freezing; ‘t’, tolerant to freezing. grey-highlighted markers in the ‘genotype at mt-ftqtl6’ part are those contained in mt-ftqtl6’s confidence interval delimited according to genotype and phenotype data from screened lines.

full-bac sequencing and wgs assembly provide sequences spanning the assembly gap coinciding with mt-ftqtl6
efforts have been made to close the assembly gap between markers nt <dig> and nt <dig>  six primary bac clone contigs partly spanning mt-ftqtl <dig> could thus be constructed . mt-ftqtl <dig> confidence interval delimited through fine mapping  is partly covered by bac clone contig iv . in order to generate the candidate genomic sequence of mt-ftqtl <dig>  inserts from bac clones mth2-92o <dig>  mte1-60a <dig> and mth2-221p <dig>  were first fully-sequenced . sequence information from these  <dig> clones  extended bac clone mth2-53l <dig> insert sequence  with  <dig>  bp assembled in  <dig> contigs . with illumina wgs sequences becoming available from a <dig> , bac by bac sequencing has not been kept up. instead, marker and bac-end sequences associated with mt-ftqtl <dig> were used to search for scaffold sequences corresponding to the target region. a scaffold of more than 1 mb long, namely scaffold065bis, was thus identified. it covers bac clone contigs iv and v  and extends mth2-221p <dig> insert sequence with approximately  <dig> kb .

twenty non-transposon genes reside in mt-ftqtl <dig> confidence interval
twenty non-transposon genes with significant matches to genbank’s non-redundant nucleotide , expressed sequence tag and protein databases, including those corresponding to markers mtic <dig> and nt <dig>  could be identified in the candidate sequence for mt-ftqtl <dig> . spacing between adjacent genes varies from  <dig>  bp  up to  <dig>  bp . coding sequences have an overall g + c content of  <dig> %. sixteen genes are supported by cognate est and additionally  <dig> of them by cdna sequences . comparisons between genomic and est/cdna sequences indicate that four genes  have  <dig> transcript isoforms each.table  <dig>

 corresponding est and cdna were identified through blast searches against m. truncatula est and nr/nt databases in genbank  <cit>  , respectively. in case of alternate splicing, the sequence corresponding to the less represented transcript isoform is in italics;  similar to  <cit> , the c-terminal domains of mtcbf2-3;5-11; <dig> were considered as the amino acid sequences that occur after the signature motif “dsawr” and that up to the last amino acid of the protein;  a cdna sequence corresponding to mtcbf <dig> was directly submitted to genbank  <cit>  by chen jr, guo l, wang h in  <dig>  the respective locus was referred to as dreb1a;  in addition to mtr_050s <dig> and mtr_050s <dig>   <dig> other non-transposon genes could be identified on ac <dig> but were not considered in this study. in fact, the corresponding genomic region for these latter, spanning  <dig>  kb  is completely missing from scaffold065bis. because of its size exceeding  <dig> kb, ac <dig> seems to have resulted from sequencing inserts of at least two bac clones, one of which did not originate from mt-ftqtl6-containing region;  the intron/exon structure of mtr_050s <dig> from m. truncatula mt <dig>  genome assembly has been revised and its corresponding coding sequence found to contain  <dig> introns instead of  <dig>  m. truncatula est and close protein sequences together with est from other papilionoideae species and notably a pisum sativum l. sequence generated by rnaseq  were used for this purpose;  as related est do not fully cover mtzfwd coding sequence, intron positions were predicted after multiple alignment with the coding sequences of glyma16g <dig> and glyma09g <dig> and est sequences from lathyrus odoratus l. , l. japonicus  and phaseolus acutifolius a. gray ;  as the est bq <dig> does not cover the entire coding sequence of mtr_054s <dig>  highly similar est sequences from l. japonicus , vigna unguiculata  walp.  and g. max  were used for intron location. the positions and sizes of introns  <dig> and  <dig> are different from mt <dig> .



all positional candidate genes for mt-ftqtl <dig> were found to have highly similar counterparts across a set of dicotyledonous species for which genome sequence information is available . all, except for homologous genes to mtr_054s <dig>  are contained in syntenic blocks exhibiting large gene order conservation with mt-ftqtl <dig> . three chromosomal segments in a. thaliana and in solanum lycopersicum l., two segments in populus trichocarpa  and a single segment in vitis vinifera l. share colinearity with mt-ftqtl <dig>  among legumes, two additional m. truncatula, six glycine max  merr. and three lotus japonicus l. regions are colinear with mt-ftqtl <dig>  few rearrangements could be noted among conserved regions including gene loss, local duplication or also translocation events .

twelve candidate genes organized in a tandem array belong to the cbf/dreb <dig> group of the ap2/erebp transcription factor family
cbf/dreb <dig> genes represent 60% of all candidates for mt-ftqtl <dig> . they are organized in a tandem cluster spanning a region of approximately  <dig> kb . no intervening spacer genes, except those for retrotransposons, exist in between. mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> are pseudogenes. a deletion of a guanine at position  <dig> in mtcbf <dig> coding sequence causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon at the 148th amino acid. mtcbf <dig> coding region shows an in-frame 848-bp insertion and two point mutations leading each to a premature stop codon. mtcbf2-3;5-11; <dig> are likely to represent functional protein-coding genes. the corresponding proteins share  <dig> to 92% overall amino acid identity  and all show typical features of the cbf/dreb <dig> group . they have each a 58-amino acid long ap2/erf nuclear signaling and dna binding domain  and an acidic c-terminal region  that may function in trans-activation  <cit> . mtcbf <dig> contains in addition to the 58-amino acid ap2/erf domain, a 17-amino acid long sequence most likely corresponding to the c-terminal end of a second ap2/erf domain . cbf signature sequences comprising pkkp/ragrxkfxetrhp and dsawr motifs bracketing the ap2/erf domain  <cit>  are largely conserved among mtcbf2-3;5-11; <dig>  these latter also show axxaxxf  <cit>  and lwsy motifs  <cit> , reported to be conserved in cbf/dreb <dig> proteins in different plant species. variants at the cbf/dreb <dig> characteristic amino acid sequences are listed in additional file  <dig>  the xag xxpp sequence, previously suggested as a cbf/dreb <dig> conserved motif  <cit>  is not present in mtcbf2-3;5- <dig> except for the nma motif. these proteins have rather a nmlmspths conserved sequence at the same position.figure  <dig> 
alignment of predicted mtcbf2-3;5- <dig> sequences. hypothetical protein sequences are used for mtcbf12- <dig>  these were obtained after eliminating truncating mutations from the corresponding coding sequences. for mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig>  proteins encoded by both transcript variants are shown. mtcbf <dig> protein sequence, likely resulting from a chimeric gene, is separated from others. conserved amino acid residues are in white. they are shaded in black when shared by all sequences or in grey if a single exception exists. conserved amino acid residues in the c-terminal regions of mtcbf5; <dig> ;7; <dig>  resulting from intron-containing transcripts are in black and grey-shaded. the ap2/erf domain is underlined and conserved amino acid residues therein are in red. open squares show conserved valine and glutamic acid residues at the 14th and 19th position of the ap2/erf domain similarly to other cbf/dreb <dig> sequences; v <dig> is critical for determining the dna binding specificity of cbf/dreb <dig> proteins  <cit> . solid squares indicate the conserved wlg motif in the middle of the ap2/erf domain which is a common feature with almost all a. thaliana, g. max and oryza sativa l. genes carrying a single ap2/erf domain  <cit> . solid and open triangles show conserved amino acid residues involved in the interaction of the ap2/erf domain with target dna sequences and the sugar phosphate backbone, respectively  <cit> . the axxaxxf  <cit>  and lwsy motifs  <cit>  are underlined with crosses and the cbf/dreb <dig> signature sequences bracketing the ap2/erf domain  <cit>  with asterisks. open circles indicate arginine and phenylalanine residues in the pkk/rpagrxkfxetrhp signature sequence reported to be critical for dna binding  <cit> . the c-terminal clusters of hydrophobic residues  <cit>  that may contribute positively  or negatively  to the trans-activating properties of mtcbf2-3;5-10;12- <dig> are double-underlined. for mtcbf <dig>  the second  ap2/erf domain is boxed; the lwsy motif and additional dsawr and axxaxxf motifs are dotted-underlined.

distinct levels of polymorphism exist between mtcbf2-3;5-12; <dig> alleles from f83005- <dig> and dza045-5
mtcbf2-3;5-12; <dig> specific primers yielded positive amplification from f83005- <dig> and dza045- <dig> indicating that all  <dig> genes are present in these accessions. no amplification could be obtained with mtcbf13-specific primers from both accessions despite using different primer combinations and pcr conditions. for mtcbf <dig>  two distinct pcr products were obtained from f83005- <dig>  using distinct forward primers but not from dza045- <dig>  thus indicating that this gene has undergone duplication at least in f83005-5’s background. overall,  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp  of comparable sequences were generated . they show a total of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism ,  <dig> insertion-deletion  and  <dig> simple sequence repeat  polymorphisms with  <dig> snp,  <dig> indel and  <dig> ssr located in the coding sequences . contrary to a <dig> and f83005- <dig>  dza045- <dig> has an insertion of a 160-bp short interspersed nuclear element  in the coding sequence of mtcbf <dig> and another sine element in the 5′ upstream region of mtcbf <dig>  f83005- <dig> has a specific insertion of a putative miniature inverted-repeat transposable element in the 5′ upstream region of mtcbf <dig>

discussion
m. truncatula is a valuable forage crop and also a prominent model for legume genomics. freezing tolerance qtl have been previously identified in m. truncatula <cit> . in the current study, mt-ftqtl <dig> has been finely mapped by genetically and physiologically characterizing recombinant haplotypes carrying recombination events within the qtl confidence interval. genomic data have been developed to fill the genome assembly gap in mt-ftqtl <dig> region and have permitted to reveal twenty positional candidate genes. interestingly, twelve genes belong to the cbf/dreb <dig> group of the ap2/erebp transcription factor family and occur in tandem array.

current knowledge on the functions of the twenty positional candidate genes for mt-ftqtl6
the fine mapping step has significantly reduced mt-ftqtl6′s confidence interval and has subsequently allowed the identification of  <dig> candidate genes. functional data regarding these candidate genes are still limited at present . only homologs/orthologs of mtcbf2-3;5- <dig>  mtbag- <dig>  mtr_054s <dig> and mtzdp have been studied in plant species . for mtperld and mtr_050s <dig> which are members of evolutionary conserved gene families, only non-plant homologs have been described . mtzfwd contains both a ccch zinc finger domain and wd <dig> repeats and thus belongs to a plant-specific subgroup of ccch zinc finger protein family  <cit>  that is not yet functionally described. no data are available for mtr_050s <dig> and mtr_6g <dig> to infer putative functions. out of all candidate genes , only mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> have been functionally characterized in m. truncatula. mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> were reported to display both a rapid and transient accumulation of transcripts in the leaves of 3-week old m. truncatula plants after exposure to low temperature treatment  <cit> . furthermore, transgenic m. truncatula lines overexpressing mtcbf <dig> were shown to exhibit an improved freezing tolerance compared to the wild-type  <cit> . however, even if the cbf/dreb <dig> genes can be considered as the most likely candidates for the mt-ftqtl <dig> effect, none of the non-functionally characterized genes can be excluded at present. further knowledge needs to be gained regarding the different candidate genes and the qtl of interest itself.

co-location between a freezing tolerance qtl and cbf/dreb <dig> genes in a legume species
cbf/dreb <dig> genes were found to co-locate with qtl for freezing tolerance in several plant species including a. thaliana <cit> , triticum monococcum l.  <cit> , triticum aestivum l.  <cit>  and hordeum vulgare l. subsp. vulgare <cit> . a large deletion in the promoter region of a. thaliana cbf <dig> <cit>  and co-locations of freezing tolerance qtl in t. monococcum <cit>  and h. vulgare subsp. vulgare <cit>  with qtl for expression of cold-induced cbf/dreb <dig> target gene cor14b and accumulation of cor14b protein suggested cbf/dreb <dig> genes being responsible for the qtl effects. the identification of cbf/dreb <dig> genes among positional candidates of mt-ftqtl <dig> provides an additional example of a co-location between a freezing tolerance qtl and this group of genes but for the first time in a legume species. it will be of great interest to inspect such co-location in other legumes especially p. sativum having a freezing damage qtl syntenic to mt-ftqtl <dig>  <cit> .

large size of the cbf/dreb <dig> group in m. truncatula
this study has permitted the physical positioning of twelve m. truncatula cbf/dreb <dig> genes through the assembly of mt-ftqtl <dig> region. apart from mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> that were identified by pennycooke et al.  <cit>  and dreb1a whose cdna sequence was directly submitted to genbank , the other cbf/dreb <dig> genes associated with mt-ftqtl <dig> were not previously annotated or described . as the name “mtcbf4” has been recently assigned to a cbf/dreb <dig> gene located on m. truncatula chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , the novel genes including dreb1a were here given consecutive numbers from  <dig> to  <dig> starting from the most proximal to mtperld .

mtcbf2-3;5- <dig> occur in tandem array and are in direct orientation  which suggests that they are most likely derived from an unequal crossing over mechanism  <cit> . however, the contribution of transposable elements to this duplication event cannot be totally excluded  <cit> , especially with several transposon and retrotransposon insertions being evident between cbf/dreb <dig> genes .

according to young et al.  <cit> , m. truncatula has experienced high rates of local gene duplication compared to other plant genomes. it may thus not be surprising to have such a large tandem array organization for the mtcbf2-3;5- <dig> locus. similar tandem duplications have been described for nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat genes  <cit>  and lipoxygenase genes  <cit>  on m. truncatula chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. however, the main particularity of the tandem cluster in mt-ftqtl <dig> region is that it concerns cbf/dreb <dig> genes. large groups of cbf/dreb <dig> genes have always been thought to be limited to monocotyledons. this study reports for the first time that the cbf/dreb <dig> genes can also be highly duplicated in legume species. m. truncatula has at least  <dig> cbf/dreb <dig> genes  all located in homoeologous regions . a recent report has similarly shown that eucalyptus grandis genome contains  <dig> cbf/dreb <dig> genes  <cit> . it will be next important to determine if other legumes have as many genes that belong to the cbf/dreb <dig> group as m. truncatula. first evidences denote that there may not be a general trend at this level. as shown in additional file  <dig>  g. max does not have any duplication of cbf/dreb <dig> genes in mt-ftqtl <dig> syntenic regions. in contrast, l. japonicus has  <dig> tandemly-arrayed putative cbf/dreb <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> 

complexity of the cbf/dreb <dig> locus on m. truncatula chromosome 6
as for other duplication modes, tandem duplication generates identical genes that evolve in different ways . in the case of the locus harboring mtcbf2-3;5- <dig>  some evidences of pseudogenization are apparent: premature stop codons leading to truncated proteins exist within the corresponding coding sequences of mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> in a <dig>  mtcbf <dig> in f83005- <dig> and mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> in dza045- <dig> . however, most cbf/dreb <dig> duplicates are likely to encode functional proteins. up to date, information regarding the expression profiles of mtcbf2-3;5- <dig> is still greatly lacking. m. truncatula gene expression atlas  <cit>  provides only a first glimpse on the expression of some genes among mtcbf2-3;5- <dig> under unstressed conditions . it is thus crucial to conduct a complete survey on the expression patterns  of all cbf/dreb <dig> genes on m. truncatula chromosome  <dig>  this will determine whether tandemly duplicated cbf/dreb <dig> genes have evolved or not different expression patterns and so possibly distinct functions as already reported for different cbf/dreb <dig> genes in other plant species  <cit> . the characterization of mtcbf <dig> deserves a particular attention as its predicted protein product contains a full-length and an additional 17-amino acid long partial ap2/erf domain . mtcbf <dig> has most likely arisen from an in-frame fusion of the 5′ portion of the coding region from a first cbf/dreb <dig> gene with the 3′ portion of the coding sequence from a second gene.

alternative splicing events can diverge between duplicates, including organ- and stress-specific differences, and result in functional variation  <cit> . based on genomic sequence alignment with est and cdna data, mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> have two transcript variants each, generated by intron retention/splicing events . mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> contain each an intron at the same position as for mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> intron-spliced isoforms but no evidence yet suggests that mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> may have intron-retaining transcript forms similar to mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig>  as est databases can be incomplete with regard to alternative splicing transcript variants, reverse transcription pcr or transcription analysis using second generation sequencing would allow determining alternative splicing patterns with more precision. this is the first study to provide data on the presence of introns and alternative splicing forms in cbf/dreb <dig> genes. each of the isoforms of mtcbf5- <dig> will need to be characterized apart in order to determine if these are functional and then compare them to other cbf/dreb <dig> genes and alternatively spliced forms if any. any possible association of alternative splicing of cbf/dreb <dig> genes with m. truncatula response to low temperatures should be inspected. recent reports from grasses have shown the existence of alternatively spliced isoforms for ap2/erebp family members  homologous to a. thaliana dreb <dig> <cit>  which is known to be activated by dehydration and high-salt stresses. the alternative splicing of these genes was suggested to be important for reducing the activity of their target genes under unstressed conditions and thus preventing negative effects on plant growth.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study has permitted to narrow down the confidence interval of a major freezing tolerance qtl on m. truncatula chromosome  <dig> and to identify genes located therein. no similar studies related to legume freezing tolerance have to date been reported. candidate genes represent important elements toward positional cloning of mt-ftqtl <dig>  information gained from m. truncatula being a model species should be transferred to agronomically and economically important crop legumes. the bac clone contig map constructed for the assembly gap coinciding with mt-ftqtl <dig> will be interesting in efforts to clone important loci mapped to the same region as mt-ftqtl <dig> including a locus for resistance to subterranean clover mottle virus <cit>  and a qtl for the number of secondary branches  <cit> . when sequenced from f83005- <dig> and dza045- <dig>  mtcbf2-3;5-12; <dig> coding sequences showed distinct levels of indels and non-synonymous mutations which suggest that they have evolved in a heterogenous manner. allelic variation identified on coding and immediate flanking sequences of mtcbf2-3;5-12; <dig> will be useful for future studies to establish the adaptative value of the different cbf/dreb <dig> duplicates.
