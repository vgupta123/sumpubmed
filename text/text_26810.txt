BACKGROUND
plant mirnas are indispensable for the control of wide variety of biological functions, including development, hormone responses, feedback mechanisms and biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . most of these functions are associated with ability of mirnas in targeting mrnas coding for transcription factors and other key genes  <cit> . nearly half of all known plant mirnas that are highly conserved across plants target transcription factors  <cit> , justifying their importance in the regulation of plant processes. the remaining half of less-conserved mirnas regulate expression of a variety of protein coding genes involved in metabolic processes, transporters and the process of rna silencing itself  <cit> . additionally, role of some less-conserved mirnas in controlling disease resistance in a variety of plants has been recently reported . the well-conserved mirnas that are evolutionarily ancient have many copies in the genomes, sometimes up to  <dig> copies, largely due to genome duplications or due to the rapid evolution of their target mrnas, or both  <cit> . the duplicated copies called ‘isoforms’ may have high similarity in their mature mirna sequences, but the similarity is less obvious among regions beyond mirna stem-loops . the less conserved mirnas usually have  <dig> or  <dig> copies of themselves with high sequence similarity throughout the length of their rnas  <cit> .

mirnas are generated in a stepwise manner from long non-coding, genome-encoded polii transcripts. primary mirna transcripts of varied length must form a secondary structure that can be recognized by dicer-like protein  <dig>  and its partners. dcl <dig> complex cleaves the secondary structured rna to a pre-mirna structure having a stem with almost complete complementarity and a loop. another processing step in the cytoplasm produces mirna:mirna* duplex of predominantly  <dig> nts with 2 nt overhangs. while mirna* is usually degraded, mirnas associate with argonaute  proteins to form rna-induced silencing complexes . most of the plant mirnas appear to be targeting mrnas for degradation, typically ‘slicing’ target mrna between position  <dig> and  <dig>  there are also many reports of plant mirna:mrna complexes leading to translational inhibition  <cit> .

many factors in mirna pathway have been characterized, but there is limited information on the self-regulation of mirna pathway itself. three mirnas have been reported to regulate dcl and ago by cleaving transcripts of corresponding targets as part of a robust feedback mechanism. mir <dig> has been implicated in targeting dcl <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig> in ago <dig> mrna  and mir <dig> in targeting ago <dig> and ago <dig> mrnas in arabidopsis and other related plants . the regulation of agos is quite striking because mirnas that target mrnas of agos need to form risc complexes with ago proteins themselves.

a relatively well-known feedback mechanism involves ago <dig> homeostasis that is controlled by coordinated action of mir <dig>  <cit>  and ago1-derived sirnas  <cit>  on ago <dig> mrna. vaucheret et al.  <cit>  also identified an additional complexity of this interaction involving the ago1-mediated post-transcriptional stabilization of mir <dig> and the co-regulated expression of ago <dig> and mir <dig> genes in arabidopsis. thus, it appears that arabidopsis has a refined feedback regulatory loop that balances ago <dig> and mir <dig> accumulation. in addition, mir <dig> expression is regulated by invading viruses. upon infection with wide range of viruses, mir <dig> levels go up to dramatic levels quite quickly, leading to the repression of ago <dig> translation  <cit> . a similar upregulation of mir <dig>  though proposed  <cit> , has not been experimentally verified. regulation of agos by mir <dig> and mir <dig> has been proposed to be conserved among many plants in addition to tobacco and arabidopsis, although an in-depth analysis is not forthcoming.

the induction of mirnas by viruses to meddle with ago expression indicates that pathogens use these mirnas particularly to suppress host silencing. this implies that variation in expression levels or targeting abilities of mirnas among plant lineages has the potential to be the basis of susceptibility or resistance against pathogens. in order to understand these relationships, we analyzed sequence diversity, copy numbers and expression levels of mir <dig> and mir <dig> among plant species for which a small rna dataset is available. surprisingly, our results suggest that mature sequences of mir <dig> can be classified into three clades. presence of three clades is also evident after aligning precursor sequences of these mirnas. variation in mir <dig> sequences seems to correlate well with their ago <dig> mrna targeting abilities. strikingly, tobacco  has isoforms with insertion of transposon-like sequences that are likely to reduce their processing, providing a clue to the loss of mirnas. furthermore, when we analyzed mir <dig> sequences across  <dig> plant species representing almost all major plant families, a clade specific abundance of mir <dig> was observed. the maximum abundance and diversity of mir <dig> was among monocots. monocots have more numbers of ago <dig> members than dicots, but few of them are not readily targeted by mir <dig> creating functional difference. the regulation of ago <dig> and ago <dig> mrnas by mir <dig> is specific to very few plants. mir <dig> is absent among monocots and many eudicot lineages. absence of mir <dig> among monocots indicates an inverse relationship with that of mir <dig>  since mir <dig> is highly expressed among all monocots studied. in those plants where mir <dig> is present, the sequences are less diverse and plants have fewer isoforms of this mirna indicating recent evolution of mir <dig>  together, this analysis indicates that mir168/mir <dig> relationships with their targets as observed in arabidopsis are likely to be specific only to few plant lineages and plants have evolved every shade of such regulation providing case for altered transcription factor regulations and disease resistance.

RESULTS
mir <dig> sequences from diverse plant families fall into three distinct clades
in order to understand the sequence diversity of mir <dig>  we used sequences from mirbase  as well as from genome-wide transcriptome data reported from plants that have been studied. a total of  <dig> sequences were obtained representing  <dig> families of plants. among these,  <dig> were newly designated sequences. all  <dig> mir <dig> and mir168* sequences were used for sequence alignment  that shows diversity in mature mirna sequences. similar mir <dig> diversity has been documented by a comprehensive analysis reported recently  <cit> . the mature mir <dig> sequences can be classified into  <dig> groups, a large dicot group representing most of the reported mir <dig> sequences, a monocot-specific group with sequence variations at positions  <dig> and  <dig> and a third group of mirnas with intermediate sequence variation was observed among solanaceae members. solanaceae members exhibited similar sequence in 14th position  like other dicots, but had similarity at 21st position  identical to monocots. the mir168* sequences, on the other hand, had uniform sequence diversity among monocots. distinct mir168* sequences for solanaceae members were not observed. among solanaceae members, nicotiana tabacum showed an unusual sequence diversity with two forms  showing mature mirna sequences similar to other dicots while three additional isoforms  having a solanaceae specific sequence signature. two sequences from the dicot clade, mir <dig> from brassica napus and medicago truncatula, had variations that could not be compared to three clades and are likely results of rapid independent evolution.figure  <dig>

in order to verify the presence of three groups of mir <dig> sequences, we aligned the precursors of all mir <dig> sequences using clustalw <dig>  phylogenetic tree derived from this alignment  also confirms the presence of three clades of mir <dig> sequences. this suggests that there are sequences beyond mature mirna sequences that also contribute towards clade-specificity. presence of these clades and a separate clade for solanaceae is remarkable because this indicates independent evolution of mir <dig> among solanaceae members as these species are distantly related to monocots.

if the mirnas and their targets co-evolved with their target genes in different plant lineages as proposed  <cit> , then the target mrna regions of these mirnas must have clade-specific changes. however, among the sequences of ago <dig> mrnas from corresponding plant species, there are hardly any clade/family specific changes in the mir <dig> target regions . the mir <dig> target region in ago <dig> mrnas does not code for a key rna motif that will code for a conserved domain, however, there is still high sequence conservation among ago <dig> sequences derived from distinct species. this also indicates evolutionarily ancient interaction between mir <dig> and ago <dig>  a slightly higher ago <dig> sequence divergence in the mirna target region was observed among phylogenetically unrelated species such as populus trichocarpa , cardamina flexuosa , citrus clementine , theobroma cacao  and brachypodium distachyon , functional significance of which is unknown.figure  <dig>

it is unclear whether mirnas from one plant species target their mrnas to the same levels as in other species as such studies have not been carried out. in order to understand the significance of variations in mir <dig> mature sequences we predicted the mir <dig> targeting abilities among ago <dig> mrnas of all plant species that have clearly identified mir <dig> sequences. we used both pssrnatarget  <cit>  as well tapir  <cit> , two tools that have been acknowledged to provide high reliability  <cit> . figure  <dig> indicates uniformly high targeting  for most ago <dig> mrnas irrespective of being monocots or dicots, while few showed almost no targeting. populus trichocarpa, malus domestica, theobroma cacao showed very high tapir scores of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and correspondingly low mfe ratios indicating that their ago <dig> mrnas may not be targets of their mir <dig> figure  <dig>

monocots show higher diversification of ago1s, usually with  <dig> members  <cit> , something that may have been due to ancient duplications  <cit> . we anticipated that presence of additional ago <dig> mrna may provide differential targeting abilities for monocot mir <dig> members . although there are  <dig> members of ago <dig> there are only one or two distinct mature mir <dig> sequences. some ago <dig> members of zea mays such as ago1c and ago1d are not targeted by zma mir <dig>  but ago1a and b are good targets . rice ago1d alone has slightly higher tapir score , while other ago <dig> members are good targets. among the  <dig> ago <dig> members from brachypodium, one member  is clearly not a target of bdi mir <dig> . these differences among monocots might contribute to the diversity in their mirna pathways since ago <dig> is a major player in mirna stabilization and action. we also predicted targets for few mir <dig> examples from each of the three clades with ago <dig> mrnas from the corresponding plants . this analysis shows that targeting of ago <dig> mrnas by mir <dig> in monocots is slightly less intense than among dicots based on tapir score.

secondary structures and precursor mirna features of mir168s indicate their rapid diversification in solanaceaeclade
the sequence and distance between mirnas and mirna* must indicate evolutionary history of mirnas  <cit> . however, these sequences that make up the ‘loop’ are critical for host dcl <dig> to process the long non-coding rnas into short mirnas duplexes  <cit> . the distance between mir and mir* were quite similar among most dicot mir <dig> precursors, ranging typically between  <dig> and  <dig> nts . surprisingly, monocots had very short loop sequences in the range of 20– <dig> . among the solanaceae members there were two distinct groups. one group of precursor sequences that make mature mirnas common to other dicots, have length of loop sequences between 70– <dig> typical of other dicots, while some members  have unusually long  loops.figure  <dig>

because structures of these mirna precursors are crucial for their biogenesis, a secondary structure prediction of all mir <dig> precursors was carried out using rna-fold . among the dicots, the typical secondary structure had one or two small loops and short branches. monocots having very short loops had a simple stem loop with high sequence complementarity. usually high sequence complementarity beyond mir and mir* sequences indicate their recent evolution. among the solanaceae, those with shorter loops had structures similar to other dicots, but as expected the structures of mir <dig> isoforms with long loops were complex. the nta mir168d and e precursors have long loop sequences similar to each other but extremely different from any other mir <dig> precursor . a closer look showed high sequence similarity between fragments of loop sequences between these two precursors and miniature inverted repeat transposable elements  from few dicots . mites are cut and paste type transposon elements typically leaving short fragments when they jump to newer locations. the presence of mite-like sequences in the loop region for any mirna has not been reported so far. it is important to note that piriyapongsa et al.  <cit>  have proposed that mirnas encoded by mites evolved from corresponding ancestral full-length  elements that originally encoded short interfering rnas. for mir <dig> though this may have been in a reverse order. a systematic search using published genomes identified other regions that could have been mir <dig> precursors that invited other repeat elements to become transcriptionally inactive .in tobacco, identification of mature mirnas corresponding to isoforms a, b, c  and d, e  is possible due to the sequence divergence between these isoforms. we hypothesized that insertion of mites might interfere with pri-mir <dig> transcription or biogenesis steps and therefore those isoforms with insertion should be less abundant compared to their counterparts. strikingly, tobacco mir168d,e isoforms were ~ <dig> times low abundant than a,b,c isoforms in leaves and flowers , supporting the idea that long loop-containing precursors of mir <dig> yield less abundant mature mirnas.figure  <dig> 
accumulation of mir <dig> a,b,c and mir <dig> d,e isoforms among tobacco tissues . reads of mirna or mirna* per million reads was taken from geo accession gse <dig>  similar ratio between a,b,c and d,e were observed among tobacco pods. mir <dig> sequences were retrieved as discussed in methods section.



comparative abundance of mir <dig> among plant families
we used small rna datasets derived from  <dig> plant species representing  <dig> plant families to compare expression and diversity of mir <dig> sequences. next generation small rna sequence datasets from the corresponding species were taken from geo and other published sources . the abundance of mir <dig> and those reads that match to mir <dig> with  <dig> or  <dig> mismatches were taken into consideration  as genomes of many of these plants and information about their mirnas are not readily available. the data presented in figure 6a indicates that there is very high expression of mir <dig> sequences among most monocot families when compared to dicots. the most abundant form of mir <dig> among poaceae was the monocot-specific form of mir <dig> . similar observations were made in a recent study that compared mirna diversity across vascular plants  <cit> . the other major monocot order zingiberales  on the other hand, seem to have the common dicot specific form as the most abundant. musa not only has a dicot specific form as most abundant form, but also has accumulation of mir <dig> levels matching those of dicots in that it has low accumulation. the monocot specific form surprisingly is found also among cycads , gingkophyta  and pinophyta . these species represent forms that are ancient to monocot/dicot divergence and it is easy to speculate that these two forms are ancient. magnoliids  show abundance of either mature mir <dig> form depending on the species. depending on the plant lineage some mir <dig> forms could have evolved and expressed better than the other forms. vitis vinifera , a eudicot, has higher expression of monocot specific form unlike other eudicots for those a sequence information is available, is an example wherein both forms co-exist.figure  <dig>

surprisingly, abundance of mir <dig> was comparatively low among arabidopsis and members of solanaceae such as solanum spp. and nicotiana spp. most abundant form of mir <dig> among solanaceae was the form that is distinct from other dicots. these forms have also been reported recently in a global study using small rna datasets from many vascular plants  <cit> . among dicots, some astrids such as mimulus guttatus , lactuca sativa  have the highest accumulation of mir <dig> 

consistent with the observation in arabidopsis that floral tissues accumulate more 24 nt sirnas than mirnas, mir <dig> levels are generally low among floral samples of all plant species analyzed. unexpectedly, rice  and sorghum  are some of the few species where mir <dig> was consistently expressed highly among both leaf and floral tissues .

viruses as part of their counter-defense strategy target the host agos by destabilizing them directly at the protein level . some viruses even act at a higher level by inducing degradation of mrnas of ago family members that are part of the host defense, namely ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig>  viral counter-defense by targeting of ago mrnas is through induction of mir <dig> as observed in n. benthamiana
 <cit> 
, a. thaliana
 <cit>  and s. lycopersicum
 <cit> . after analyzing the global mir <dig> levels in these species it makes sense to hypothesize why viruses need to upregulate mir <dig> to target ago <dig> mrnas. all these species have very low levels of mir <dig> in uninfected tissues indicating they may have higher accumulation of ago <dig> protein thereby indicating ago <dig> as the most likely and potent candidate to target viruses. however, such an interaction seems unlikely for monocots , members of which accumulate mir <dig> at higher levels even without any biotic stress. by analyzing publicly available small rna datasets we can show that mir <dig> induction upon virus infection of rice  is hardly noteworthy . corresponding levels of increase in mir <dig> levels upon viral infection for few dicots such as n. benthamiana, arabidopsis and tomato are at much higher levels  <cit> . this difference in mir <dig> levels upon virus infection among dicots and monocots is important because ago <dig> protein levels go down dramatically upon virus infection in arabidopsis and nicotiana members  <cit> , while in rice, the reduction in ago <dig> protein level is negligible  <cit> . these results suggest a functional difference in downstream activities of ago <dig> among monocots and dicots that is brought about by variation in expression levels of mir <dig> 

mir <dig> has low sequence diversity and are present only among selected lineages of plants
a similar search for mir <dig> in mirbase as well as transcript databases recovered  <dig> sequences . mir <dig> has been reported to be absent in monocots  <cit> , but a detailed information of plant families where this mirna is present is not known. among the plants where mir <dig> is reported, glycine max alone has a sequence variation  when compared to all other species. this lack of diversity in sequences arises from its recent evolution as this mirna is present only in few lineages of eudicots. some plant species have many copies of mir <dig>  for example vitis has  <dig> copies, all with the same mature sequence but with diverse mir* sequences. the most common and abundant form of the mir <dig> is 5’-uuagauucacgcacaaacucg-3’. few interesting deviations from this sequence were observed in solanaceae members  and some malvids  sharing 5’-cuagauucacgcacaaacucg-3’ as the major mir <dig> isoform. this isoform is extremely interesting in that it has an unusual 5’ terminal nucleotide as c. one more abundant form specific to gossypium arboreum is 5’-uuagauucacgcacaaacuca-3’, thus, malvids seem to have the most diversity in mir <dig> sequences.figure  <dig>

surprisingly, while two sets of rosiids called malvids and vitales have abundant mir <dig>  some fabids  have no expression of mir <dig> . however, populus trichocarpa , a member of malphigiales that belong to fabidae have high expression of mir <dig>  vitales have very high expression both in vegetative and reproductive tissues , followed by few solanaceae members .figure  <dig>

targeting of ago <dig> and ago <dig> mrnas by mir <dig> is restricted to few plant lineages
mir <dig> targets mrnas of ago <dig> and ago <dig> in arabidopsis. it has been proposed that viruses may interfere with mir <dig> expression in order to reduce the expression of ago <dig>  considered as a major antiviral ago. when we analyzed ago <dig> mrnas from those species where mir <dig> accumulation could be detected, it was observed that targeting of ago <dig> mrna is very efficient in brassicaceae  and vitales , while it is ineffective with score of excess of  <dig> among fabids . it is important to note that vitales have not only very high expression of mir <dig>  but also have high ago <dig> targeting ability compared to other plant families. we also checked targeting of ago <dig> mrnas by mir <dig>  such a targeting seem to be possible only among arabidopsis spp.  but not among members of any other plant family. functional significance of this relationship is not known.

discussion
ago expression levels and susceptibility to viruses
it has been clearly shown that few agos in addition to being important for development by controlling transcription factors and other endogenes, are the first line of defense against incoming pathogens. two lines of evidence are strongly in favor of this observation. firstly, viral and other pathogen-derived sirnas are incorporated into ago <dig> and to less extent ago <dig>  thereby performing the role of targeting complementary mrnas derived from the incoming pathogens themselves. secondly, pathogens have the ability to selectively target these agos both at post-transcriptional as well as post-translational steps. since ago <dig> is responsible for stabilization and activity of most mirnas, it has been well documented that mirna levels change generally during pathogenesis, especially during virus infections, due to ago <dig> targeting. unlike most mirnas that change marginally during viral infections, levels of mir <dig> changes drastically. this specific change is likely brought about by viral counter-defense proteins, but the mechanism is largely unknown. however, it has been clearly shown that this interaction is crucial for pathogenicity. thus, absence or lower expression of mir <dig> in some plants  may indicate a higher expression of ago <dig> in those species and this is where viruses might need to target ago <dig> as part of their counter defense strategy. in line with this hypothesis, virus-mediated induction of mir <dig> has been observed among those plants where mir <dig> levels are generally lower in the absence of viral infections. on the other hand, higher expression of mir <dig> in some plant lineages might be resulting in a lower accumulation of corresponding agos. indeed in leaves and roots of rice, a monocot, where mir <dig> levels are quite high, expression of ago1s is comparatively at lower levels than in arabidopsis
 <cit> . in such cases, viruses need not target ago <dig> as part of their counter-defense simply because antiviral role by ago <dig> may be negligible or is taken over by other agos. this may be the case for rice, where neither a strong induction of mir <dig>  nor a corresponding reduction in ago <dig> levels has been observed upon viral infections .

on the other hand, absence of mir <dig> among monocots correlates well with the expression levels of ago <dig>  in rice, ago <dig> expression is very high among all tissues unlike in arabidopsis where ago <dig> expression is largely confined to siliques and at much lower levels in leaves  <cit> . it remains to be investigated if ago <dig> indeed acts as an antiviral ago among monocots. however, unlike in arabidopsis where ago <dig> gets induced during viral infections  <cit> , there is hardly any change in ago <dig> levels during rice stripe virus and rice dwarf virus infections in rice  <cit> . this supports our view that induction and regulation of agos by viruses is restricted to few plant lineages.

rapid evolution of tobacco mir <dig> isoforms
a case for loss of mirnas can be argued based on the mir <dig> diversity in n. tabacum. the common dicot forms of mir <dig> in tobacco  have insertions of mite-like transposons. a direct result of this insertion corresponds to reduced accumulation of mature mirna forms in all tissue types. the solanaceae-specific forms on the other hand , does not have mite-like insertions and are expressed at high levels. a duplication event of mir <dig> in tobacco might have ended up with isoforms having two different mir <dig> sequences. one set  while retaining mature mir <dig> of dicot ancestor, attracted transposons in the loop region. tobacco seems to be a hotbed for mir <dig> duplication since it already has the most diverse mir <dig> precursors. in addition, there are many tobacco genomic regions matching mir <dig> sequences present in the genome, sometimes their mir* sequences either missing or present a long distance downstream or upstream. these may represent the lost mir <dig> isoforms. it is possible that mir <dig> example that is observed in tobacco is seen in other mirnas where some forms are lost during duplication and subsequent loss.

transposons invite sirnas and methylation. invasive transposons such as mites can be detected and neutralized using rna-directed dna methylation  <cit> . this may be how promoters of some mirnas become methylated and inactive. it is possible thus that tobacco mir <dig> d and e isoforms may have been targets of rna-directed dna methylation and hence no longer express their rnas. it will be interesting to speculate if viruses can still modulate expression of tobacco mir168d and e. unfortunately, there are no small rna datasets from tobacco infected with viruses to see if mir <dig> d and e isoforms are induced upon virus infection. however, other line of evidence suggests that these isoforms are not likely induced upon virus infections. usually upon virus infections, not just mature mir <dig>  but also its stem-loop structures over-accumulate  <cit> . however, mir168d and e may not be induced by viruses as seen from the absence of accumulation of their precursors or pre-mirnas  <cit> . a stem-loop of mir <dig> d and e  was not seen among tobacco samples infected with viruses.

CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that intricacies of ago targeting by mirnas as observed in arabidopsis is specific only among few plant lineages. plants have evolved every shade of this regulation providing case for varying mirna levels, thus influencing transcription factor and other activities regulated by mirnas. the nature of this interaction may also influence disease resistance due to the way viruses use these mirnas to manage the arms race with their host plants.
