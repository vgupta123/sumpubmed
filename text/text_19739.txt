BACKGROUND
with advances in molecular biology technologies for whole genome sequencing, expression profiling, and high-throughput experiments, large amounts of biological data covering various biological levels have emerged . these kinds of ‘omics’ data include genetic sequences , microarray-based genome-wide expression profiles , protein abundance data , and microrna  and methylation data, and they provide an unprecedented view of cellular components and their cellular mechanisms in biological systems  <cit> . with the large amount of genomic/transcriptomic and epigenetic data that has accumulated, a more complex cellular function understanding of living organisms is possible. computational systems biology techniques able to combine these large, heterogeneous genomic/transcriptomic and epigenetic data sets will provide useful tools to gain additional systems biology insights into cellular mechanism under a specific biological condition, for example, cancer cells or infected cells  <cit> .

many studies have focused on gene regulatory networks  and protein–protein interaction networks . classical graph algorithms have been used to integrate cellular networks of protein–protein and protein–dna interactions. well-known simple and complex regulatory circuits have been identified and many putative regulatory circuits have been discussed. in  <cit> , this study includes searches for composite network motifs, which consist of both transcription regulation and protein–protein interactions  that recur significantly more often than expected in random networks. in  <cit> , integrated networks comprise transcriptional and ppi data. interspecific analysis has shown that several types of network motifs are not subject to any particular evolutionary pressure to preserve the corresponding interaction patterns of important biological functions. studies have also integrated protein–protein and protein–dna interactions to infer signaling regulatory pathways, but they focus only on pathways that explain gene expression changes in response to gene knockouts  <cit> . recently, an integrated cellular network of transcription regulation and ppis was introduced by wang and chen  <cit> . they use gene-expression data at multiple time points to prune and combine candidate gene regulatory and signaling networks obtained from genome-scale data. an integrated and focused network for a specific condition of interest is then obtained. the transcriptional network is characterized as a dynamical system in which the expression of a target gene is modeled as a function of the regulatory effect of its corresponding transcription factors  and mrna degradation. the modeling of a signaling/protein interaction network accounts for the activity of neighboring loci in the network. genomic/transcriptomic and high-throughput methods have successfully identified many grns and ppins. however, to explore cellular mechanism, we need more genomic data, such as epigenetic regulation data.

in real cellular systems, the expression of protein-coding genes is controlled by a complex network of genetic and epigenetic regulatory interactions. in addition to the abovementioned genetic regulation mechanisms, epigenetic regulation via dna methylation is also an important regulatory mechanism in several cellular processes. recently, high-throughput next-generation sequencing  data containing information on mrnas, micrornas , and methylation has been generated. therefore, many compelling biological questions center on how regulation and interactions among genes, proteins, and epigenetic regulators give rise to specific cellular mechanisms. to address this problem, we proposed a method to construct an integrated cellular network that can explain specific cellular mechanisms under genetic and epigenetic regulation in response to specific biological conditions, based on the coupling of stochastic dynamic models. recently, systems biology and computational biology methods have been widely employed to develop stochastic dynamic models that describe biological functions from a dynamic systems perspective . dynamic models to construct an integrated genetic and epigenetic cellular network  not only provide a quantitative description of the integrated cellular network, but also predict the cellular mechanism of the network in response to various conditions, gene knockouts, treatments with external agents, etc  <cit> .

in this study, we integrated omics data, including ngs  <cit> , mrna and mirna expression  <cit> , rna sequencing   <cit> , ppis  <cit> , transcription regulation interaction , mirna-target gene association , and gene ontology  data  to construct a candidate igecn. a schematic diagram of the candidate igecn is shown in fig.  <dig>  the candidate igecn mainly consisted of three sub-networks. the first was the candidate ppin, which included candidate ppis in signal transduction pathways and metabolic pathways; the second was the grn, which described transcription regulation; the third was the candidate mirna regulatory network. epigenetic dna methylation was also considered, which involves the modification of dna to influence mrna transcription. the tfs in fig.  <dig> are at the interface between the ppin and grn, and genes are at the interface between the grn, ppin, and mirna and methylation regulatory networks.fig.  <dig> schematic diagram of candidate integrated genetic and epigenetic cellular networks . the candidate igecn was constructed using omics data and database mining. the candidate igecn mainly consisted of three sub-networks: the candidate protein-protein interaction network  including signal transduction pathways and metabolic pathways, the candidate gene regulatory network  in which transcriptional regulation occurs, and the candidate mirna regulatory network. the epigenetic regulation of dna methylation was considered to influence gene transcription. transcription factors  represent the interface between ppins and grns, and genes represent the interface between grns, mirna regulatory networks, ppins, and methylation regulatory networks



since the candidate igecn was constructed using omics data and big database mining, for data collected under various experimental conditions , it must contain many false positive interactions and regulations in the candidate ppin and grn, respectively. therefore, it is necessary to prune these false positives, which may not explain real-world cellular mechanisms of biological organisms. in this situation, it is more appealing to evaluate these interactions and regulations in the candidate igecn for investigating whole cellular mechanisms of a real organism under specific conditions  using gene expression profile data, protein expression profile data, and mirna expression profile data via dynamic interaction and regulation models. the false positive interactions and regulations can be pruned based on these real-time data to construct an accurate igecn for some specific cellular mechanisms.

in this study, three coupling stochastic dynamic models were proposed to develop a candidate igecn that describes the interplay between the grn, ppi network, and mirna network and accounts for methylation regulation in the grn. after system parameter estimation for coupling stochastic dynamic models of candidate igecn by these time-profile data, the akaike information criterion  and the p-value statistical method  <cit>  were employed to detect the system order  of coupling stochastic dynamic models, and then prune the false positive regulations and interactions, which are not significant and out of system order, to obtain the real igecn for some specific cellular mechanisms in response to some specific biological condition. by the interplay of genetic transcription regulation, ppis, and mirna regulation and dna methylation of the identified igecn, the cellular machanism can be elucidated comprehensively.

to investigate host-pathogen interspecies cellular interactions and regulations in the host cells is a very important research topic in attempts to understand pathogenic and defensive mechanisms in the hiv infection process and help control the clinic pathogenic infections. in this study, the igecn is constructed for investigating host-pathogen crosstalks in hiv-infected cells by gene expression profile and mirna profile of ngs data. some significant cross-talk hubs in the interspecies igecn can be extracted as significant crosstalk network marker, from which we could get more insight into the pathogenic mechanism of hiv virus and the defense mechanism of human. further, the igecn is also constructed for cancer cells and compared with normal cells to find the significant network marker to investigate some significant cues from the genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms using ngs data.

construction of the dynamic models in igecn
our goal was to construct an igecn in which the transcription regulation mechanisms, mirna regulations, ppis, and epigenetic regulation via dna <dig> methylation are integrated for investigating whole cellular mechanisms under specific biological conditions. a flow chart describing the proposed method to construct the igecn is shown in fig.  <dig>  several kinds of nsg omics data and information derived from databases are integrated, including microarray gene expression data, ppi data, mirna expression data, and mirna-target gene association data, as the input for the proposed igecn construction method. from these data, the candidate grn, ppin, and mirna regulatory network using the broad tf-gene regulation pool, ppi pool, and mirna regulatory pool, respectively, under various biological conditions were retrieved to construct a candidate igecn. in this study, ngs data including gene expression and mirna profiles were used to validate these integrated tf-gene regulation data, ppis, and mirna regulation data in the candidate igecn. therefore, stochastic dynamic models were used to identify interactions and regulatory mechanisms in the candidate igcen by gene expression and mirna expression profiles using ngs data under a specific biological condition of interest, for example, cancer or infections.fig.  <dig> flowchart  and block diagram  of the proposed method to integrate genetic and epigenetic cellular networks



in the transcriptional regulation sub-network of the candidate igecn, the candidate grn was depicted as a stochastic dynamic system in which the regulations of tfs and mirnas are the inputs and gene expression levels of target genes are outputs . for target gene i in the candidate grn, the stochastic dynamic model is described by the following stochastic discrete dynamic equation:  <dig> xit+1=xit+∑j=1jiaijyjt−∑l=1licilxitslt−λixit+ki+wit, where xi denotes the mrna expression level of the ith target gene at time t +  <dig>  aij represents the regulatory ability of the jth tf to the ith target gene , the regulatory ability aij is also influenced by the dna methylations of the corresponding gene  <cit> , yj represents the regulation function of the jth tf binding to the target gene i, λi indicates the degradation effect from the present time t to time t +  <dig>  ki represents the basal level , sl denotes the expression level of the lth mirna, the parameter cil represents the rate of mirna-mrna coupling , and wi denotes the stochastic noise due to modeling residue and fluctuation in the expression profile of the target gene. the biological interpretation of equation  is that the mrna expression xi of the target gene i at time t +  <dig> is a function of the present mrna expression xi and mrna expression due to transcriptional regulation of ji tfs that bind to the target gene at time t, minus the inhibitory regulation of li mirnas at time t, minus the mrna due to the degradation over time, plus the basal level of mrna expression, and stochastic noise due to measurement and random fluctuations in the expression profile of target gene i.

in the candidate mirna regulatory sub-network, the stochastic dynamic model of the lth mirna can be described by the following stochastic discrete time dynamic equation  <cit> :  <dig> slt+1=slt−∑i=1ilcilsltxit−rlslt+kl+ϖlt, where the degradation of mirna, i.e. ∑i=1ilcilsltxit, is accompanied by mrna degradation events induced by the mirna in . that is, the lth mirna induces the degradation of il mrnas at present. rl denotes the self-degradation rate, kl denotes the production rate of the lth mirna, and ϖl denotes the stochastic noise.

in the ppi sub-network, the candidate ppis were depicted as a system in which expressions of mrna and tfs are input/output of the system . for a target protein j in the candidate ppi sub-network, the stochastic dynamic model of protein expression level is given as follows:  <dig> yjt+1=yjt−∑m=1mjbjmyjtymt+αjxjt−βjyjt+hj+ζjt where yj represents the expression level at time t of the target protein j, bjm denotes the interaction ability between the mth interactive protein ym and the target protein yj, αj represents the effect of protein synthesis from mrna, xj denotes the mrna expression level of the jth protein, hj represents the basal expression level, and ζj is the stochastic noise. the rate of formation of the protein complex yjym is proportional to the product of the concentration of each proteins  <cit> , i.e., it is proportional to the probability of molecular collisions between two proteins; thus, the protein interaction complex was modeled as nonlinear multiplication scheme.

the biological interpretation of equation  is that the expression level of the target protein j at time t +  <dig> is a function of the protein expression level at time t, minus protein complex interactions with mj proteins, plus the translation effect, minus the present protein degradation, plus the basal protein level from other sources and stochastic interactions. it is noted that there is no directionality for interacting proteins in the ppi sub-network.

the regulatory effects and interactions between genes, proteins, mirna, and dna methylation in the candidate igecn are described in the following. some tfs yj at the end of candidate signal transduction pathways  regulate target genes according to the regulation function aijyj shown in equation , and mrnas of target genes are also negatively regulated by some mirnas sl. the regulated genes influence the corresponding protein expression level via translation from mrna xj to protein αjxj, as described in . an mrna degradation event, -cilxisl, described in , induced by mirna sl, also leads to the degradation of mirna, -cilslxi, in . epigenetic dna methylation also influences the regulation parameter aij and basal level ki in  and the translation rate αj from mrna to protein in . the interplay among genes, proteins, mirnas, and dna methylation can be seen in -  and fig.  <dig>  in which tfs are at the interface between ppins and grns, and genes are at the interface between grns, mirna, ppins, and dna methylation.

based on the above stochastic dynamic models - , the candidate grn can be linked through the regulatory parameters aij in  between genes and their possible regulatory tfs , and the candidate ppin can be linked through the interaction parameters bjm in  between possible interacting proteins. the candidate grn and mirna regulatory network are linked through the mirna-mrna coupling parameters cil in  and . since the candidate igecn only indicated potential tf-gene regulatory effects, ppis, and mirna-mrna couplings based on data collected by database mining, they should be confirmed by gene expression profile, protein expression profile, and mirna expression profile in ngs data. the regulatory effects aij and cil in , interaction bjm in  and regulation cil in  , which represent the edges of the candidate igecn, should be identified and validated by empirical gene, protein, and mirna expression data. these regulatory and interactive parameters were evaluated using temporal data by solving the constrained least square parameter estimation problem. owing to the limited number of temporal data points, to avoid overfitting when identifying the parameters in , the cubic spline method  <cit>  was also used to interpolate extra time points for gene expression data. the gene regulatory parameters aij and cil were identified gene by gene , so that the candidate integrated network identification process was not limited by the number of genes, proteins, and mirnas in the candidate igecn. in other words, the regulatory parameters aij and cil in  were first identified for target gene i and then for target gene i +  <dig>  i +  <dig>  etc. the models in  only represent a small fraction of real biology. for example, many post-transcriptional regulators  as well as epigenetic regulations beyond methylation were involved. the model uncertainty of real biological system and the fluctuation of expression data were involved in the stochastic noises, wi in , ϖl in , and ζj in . a model order detection method such as aic and statistical assessment like the student’s t-test  <cit>  were used to prune the false-positive regulatory effects and interactions and then detect the true interaction and regulation number of each in the candidate igecn. aic  <cit>  was applied to detect the real regulations and interactions by pruning the false positive regulations and interactions in the candidate grn , candidate mirna regulatory network , and the candidate ppi network . aic, which includes both estimated residual error and model complexity in one statistics, quantifies the relative goodness of fit of a model the minimization achieved in aic will indicate the real network with the true model order. by applying aic detection method, the insignificant parameters, aij, cil and bjm, out of network order are considered as false positives and pruned from candidate igecns. we then used student’s t-test to evaluate the significance of each regulatory parameter in   <cit> . in this way, the candidate grn, candidate ppin, and candidate mirna regulatory network based on large-scale data mining were pruned using the temporal data, leading to the construction of an accurate grn, ppin, and mirna regulatory network. based on the interactive effects between grns and signal transduction pathways  via tfs, and among grns, mirna regulatory networks, and ppins via coupling genes, these three networks were coupled to consist of the igecn.

we proposed a general method to construct the igecn using large-scale database mining and system identification for cellular functions. in the following, two examples are given to illustrate the application of the igecn system to investigate cellular mechanisms under different biological conditions. in the first example, an igecn was constructed to investigate cellular mechanisms under cancer conditions and in the second example, an igecn was constructed to investigate pathogenic and defensive cellular mechanisms under hiv infection conditions.

identification of the regulatory parameter aij from the ith tf to the jth target gene, interaction bjm between the jth and mth proteins, and coupling rate cil between the lth mirna and the ith mrna in igecn
after constructing the coupling dynamic models - in the candidate igecn, the regulative and interactive parameters have to be identified using ngs data. the strategy is to identify the igecn gene by gene, protein by protein, and mirna by mirna. before applying the identification method, we first examine the dynamic models carefully. in , the basal level ki should be always non-negative, because the gene expressions are always non-negative. because the parameters in  have certain constraints, the regulatory parameters were identified by solving the constrained least square parameter estimation.

the mrna model  was rewritten as the following linear regression form  <dig> xit+1=y1t⋯yjitxit−s1txit⋯−slitxit1ai1⋮aiji1−λici1⋮ciliki+wit=ϕitθi1+wit where ϕi denotes the regression vector which can be obtained from the processing above and θi <dig> is the parameter vector of target gene i to be estimated. in order to avoid overfitting in the parameter estimation process, when identifying the regulatory parameters, the cubic spline method  was also used to interpolate extra time points for yi, xi and si from ngs data.

the mrna model  at different time points can be arranged as follows.  <dig> xit2xit3⋮xitl=ϕit1ϕit2⋮ϕitl−1θi1+wit1wit3⋮witl− <dig> where l is the number of expression time points of ngs data after cubic spline interpolation.

for simplicity, we define the symbols xi, Φi, and wi to express  as follows.  <dig> xi=Φiθi1+wi 

the constrained least square parameter estimation problem of θi <dig> is showed as follows.  <dig> minθi1Φiθi1−xi22subjecttoaθi1≤b where  and b = t that give the constraints to force the mirna inhibition -cil to be always non-positive, and the basal level ki to be always non-negative in , i.e. -cil ≤  <dig>  and ki ≥  <dig> the constrained least square problem was solved using the active set method for quadratic programming  <cit> .

similarly, the mirna model  was rewritten in the following regression form.  <dig> slt+1=slt−sltx1t⋯−sltxilt11−rlc1l⋮cillkl+ϖlt=ψltθl2+ϖlt where ψl denotes the regression vector and θl <dig> indicates the parameter vector to be estimated. by cubic spline method, at different time points,  can be represented as the following equation.  <dig> sl=Ψlθl2+wl 

the parameter identification problem is then expressed as follows.  <dig> minθi2Ψlθl2−sl22subjecttobθl1≤b where b=000−1000⋱000−1⏞il+ <dig>  and b = t that give the constraint to force the mirna degradation -cil to be always non-positive, and the basal level kl to be always non-negative in , i.e. -cil ≤  <dig>  and kl ≥  <dig>  finally, the protein model  uses the same way like above to make sure –bjm ≤  <dig>  and αj, hj ≥  <dig>  according to large-scale measurement of protein activities, 73 % of the variance in protein abundance could be illustrated by mrna abundance  <cit> . mrna expression levels were frequently used to substitute for the protein expression levels. if the simultaneously measured genome-wide protein expression data and mrna expression data in each cancer stage are available, the general models in  can also be applied to identify the real network in cancer. after the parameter identification problem was solved, we can identify the igecn. for example, we identified the regulatory parameter arbm <dig> ets <dig> =- <dig>  from the tf ets <dig> to the target gene rbm <dig>  interaction parameter bpgr,ncoa <dig> = <dig>  between the  <dig> proteins pgr and ncoa <dig>  and coupling rate cusp <dig> mir <dig> = <dig>  between the mirna mir <dig> and the mrna usp <dig> in gastric cancer cells.

by using student’s t-test  <cit> , the p-values for the estimated parameters, including the regulatory ability aij in , the mirna-mrna coupling rate cil in  and , the protein interaction ability bjm in , were calculated to determine the significance of the parameters. by using one-way anova, we calculated the p-value for each gene to determine the significance of expression change between normal and tumor cells in cancers, and between normal and hiv-infected human cells. the human dna methylation profiles of liver cancers , and gastric cancer  were available in tcga. a one-way anova was also used to calculate the p-value of each gene to determine the significance of dna methylation change between normal and tumor cells in each cancer.

RESULTS
the construction of igecn is very useful to investigate the whole cellular mechanisms of specific biological conditions by big database mining and ngs data. the following two examples were given to illustrate how to construct igecn to investigate the roles of genetic and epigenetic methylation and mirna dysregulations in gastric tumorigenesis and hiv infection. based on these significant core network biomarkers in igecn, potential multiple drug targets were also proposed for the development of therapeutic treatment. construction of igecn to investigate significant cellular mechanisms in gastric tumorigenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis



cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease that is highly robust against therapeutic interventions. it is a constellation of diverse and evolving disorders characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of cells that may eventually lead to fatal dysfunction of the cellular system. although some cancer subtypes can be cured by early diagnosis and specific treatment, no effective treatment has been established for many subtypes. due to the complex, heterogeneous, and evolving nature of cancer, it is appealing to construct an igecn to gain insight into the carcinogenesis process using large-scale data mining and systematic genetic modeling and various types of omics and temporal data.

based on the importance of epigenetic modifications in cancer, we identified igecns using raw data collected at various stages of cancer as the temporal information for gastric tumorigenesis  and hepatocarcinogenesis , demonstrating large differences between mirna regulations of normal and tumor tissues in gastric tumorigenesis. the results  show that two cell cycle genes, ubiquitin c  and ataxia telangiectasia mutated , and one chromosomal translocation gene, creb binding protein , play important roles in gastric tumorigenesis via genetic and epigenetic regulation. atm is an important cell cycle checkpoint kinase  <cit>  , and chromosomal translocation plays a critical role in gastric tumorigenesis  <cit> . we identified that  <dig> genes have basal level difference between cancer and normal cells, including runx <dig> , arhgdib , psme <dig> , vamp <dig> , polg , gzmb , and rbm <dig> , which are mainly due to dna methylation of the corresponding genes. in order to validate our finding, we used the epigenomics data of human gastric cancer in tcga. according to dna methylation profiles of gastric cancer cells and normal gastric cells from tcga, we found that  <dig> genes have methylation change, including runx <dig> , arhgdib , psme <dig> , gzmb , and rbm <dig> , and  <dig> genes have small methylation change including vamp <dig> , polg  between gastric cancer cells and normal gastric cells .fig.  <dig> the integrated genetic and epigenetic cellular network for investigating the cellular mechanisms of normal and tumor tissues in gastric cancer. the associations include the networks in tumor cells , normal cells , and both . the bold lines indicate large genetic and epigenetic regulatory effects or genetic expression. dysregulation of mir <dig> contributes to initiation and progression of inflammation-induced gastric cancer, and pml, a potential drug target, overcomes platinum resistance in platinum-based chemotherapy in gastric cancer

moreover, we also identified that  <dig> genes have basal level difference between hepatocellular carcinomas  and normal cells, including elavl <dig> , jmjd1c , gadd45a , eif2ak <dig> , and gsn , which is mainly due to dna methylation of the corresponding genes . we used the epigenomics data of hccs in tcga to support the results. according to dna methylation profiles of hccs and normal liver cells from tcga, we found that  <dig> gene have methylation changes, including elavl <dig> , jmjd1c , gadd45a , eif2ak <dig> , and gsn . construction of an igecn for investigating pathogenic and defensive mechanisms of hiv-1-infected cells



human hiv was first identified in  <dig> and rapidly emerged as a virus responsible for a pandemic. at the beginning of this century, the hiv epidemic received global attention, and methods to halt and reverse the aids epidemic became an important united national millennium topic. currently, approximately  <dig> million people are living with hiv worldwide. with the advent of highly active antiretrovial therapies, hiv now can be managed as a chronic disease, but developing a cure remains a significant challenge. therefore, the investigation of interspecific host-pathogen regulatory mechanisms and interactions in cellular genetic and epigenetic systems is a very important research topic to improve understanding of pathogenic and defensive mechanisms in the hiv infection process and to help control clinical pathogenic infections. in this section, using two-sided time-profile hiv-human high-throughput sequence data , rt-pcr data, mirna data, and other omic data, the interspecific host-pathogen igecn was constructed for the hiv infection process. to construct this model, the coupling dynamic equations - should be modified to consider the pathogen in addition to the host species as follows:  <dig> xit+1=xit+∑j=1jiaijyjt−∑l=1licilxitslt+∑o=1oidiohot−λixit+ki+wit,yjt+1=yjt−∑m=1mjbjmyjtymt−∑o=1ojgjoyjthot+αjxjt−βjyjt+hj+ζjt,hot+1=hot−∑j=1jogjohotyjt−∑l=1lomolhotslt−κohot+δo+ξot,slt+1=slt−∑i=1ilcilsltxit−∑o=1olmolslthot−rlslt+kl+ϖlt, where ho denotes expression of the oth pathogen protein, and the crosstalk effect of pathogen proteins ho are considered. after system identification of coupling igecn between host and pathogen in  by ngs data at different infection stages, we found that  <dig> genes had differences in their basal levels between cancer and normal cells at the early infection stage, taf <dig> , ddx3x , and celf <dig> ;  <dig> genes had basal level differences between cancer and normal cells at the middle stage, taf <dig> , and celf <dig> ;  <dig> genes had basal level differences between cancer and normal cells at the late stage, znf <dig> , and celf <dig> . these genes with different basal levels at different infection stages are mainly due to dna methylation of stage-specific genes. previous evidence for dna methylation, including taf <dig>  <cit>  and ddx3x  <cit>  methylation in individuals with hiv infection, znf <dig> methylation in individuals with epstein–barr virus  infection  <cit> , and celf <dig> methylation in individuals with moloney leukemia virus infection  <cit> , supports our findings. however, dna methylation of genes are highly tissue-specific. if the methylation profiles of genes in hiv-infected and mock cells are available in the future, the results can be specifically supported.

by applying the raw expression data and the candidate associations in cancer cells to our model , we identified the igecns at the three infection stages . in the following section, we discuss the contribution of mirna dysregulation to gastric cancer, hiv- <dig> infection progress, and liver cancer with respect to biological functions. the results have applications to the development of therapeutic treatments.fig.  <dig> the integrated genetic and epigenetic cellular network for investigating the cellular mechanisms of normal and hiv-infected t cells at the first hiv- <dig> infection stage, i.e., the reverse transcription stage. the associations include those in hiv-infected cells , normal cells , and both cell types . the bold lines indicate large genetic and epigenetic regulatory effects or genetic expression. dysregulation of the signaling cascade from mir <dig> to sumo <dig> contributes to hiv- <dig> infection, hijacking cd4+ t cells via dysfunction of the immune and hormone pathways at the early infection stage

briefly, dysregulation of mir <dig> contributes to the initiation and progression of inflammation-induced gastric cancer; dysregulation of mir <dig> contributes to hiv- <dig> infection to hijack cd4+ t cells through dysfunction of the immune and hormone pathways; dysregulation of mir139-5p, mirlet7i, and mir10a contributes to the hiv- <dig> integration/replication stage through dna hypermethylation and immune system dysfunction; dysregulation of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> contributes to the hiv- <dig> virus assembly/budding stage through dna hypermethylation, ubiquitin transfer, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation; dysregulation of mir302a contributes to not only microvesicle-mediated transfer of mirnas but also dysfunction of nf-κb signaling pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis.

discussion
gastric cancer



mir <dig> contributes to the initiation and progression of inflammation-induced gastric cancer
until now, it has been suggested that mirnas play important roles in regulating proliferation and apoptosis to promote the invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of gastric cancer cells . although a few connections between genetic-and-epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in gastric cancer cells can be considered independently using biological experiments , the precise biological functions of mirnas in gastric cancer cells and mirnas affecting gastric cancer progression need to be determined by comparing the igecn with that of normal cells.

in this study, we identified the igecn including the largest differences in mirna regulation between normal and cancer cells . we identified that mir <dig> represses smg <dig>  in cancer cells. it has been reported that both mir <dig> and smg <dig> are involved in the initiation and progression of inflammation-induced gastric cancer  <cit> . the significant expression changes of mir <dig>  and smg <dig>  between normal gastric cells and gastric cancer cells also supported the result that mir <dig> and smg <dig> play important role in human gastric carcinogenesis.

we identified that the expression change of mir <dig>  contributes to the expression changes of rna-binding protein  <dig>   and ubiquitin specific peptidase  <dig>   via significant mirna regulations  in cancer cells. the activities of rbm <dig> and usp <dig> were also significantly activated in gastric cancer. it has been reported that the reduced rbm <dig> and usp <dig> expressions result in tumor cell proliferation  <cit>  and induce tumor cell apoptosis  <cit> , respectively. it has also been suggested that dysregulation of two proteins, il <dig> and cd <dig>  leads to dysfunction of cell proliferation in mantle cell lymphoma  <cit> , and dysregulation of mir <dig> leads to dysfunction of proliferation in esophageal cancer  <cit> . thus, we proposed that dysregulation of mirnas in gastric cancer contributes substantially to the dysfunction of proliferation and apoptosis in gastric cancer via the ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit> . tcga offers a multilayered view of genomics and epigenomics data of many human cancer types. according to dna methylation profiles of gastric cancer cells and normal gastric cells from tcga, the methylation changes of gzmb , arhgdib , psme <dig> , runx <dig> , rbm <dig> , polg , and vamp <dig>  were found by the igecn. although the methylation changes of polg and vamp <dig> were insignificant, the gene expression changes of polg  and vamp <dig>  were still significant. therefore, we suggested that other regulators may exist in regulating the expressions of polg and vamp <dig> in gastric cancer.

although platinum-based chemotherapy has been used to treat most malignant diseases, platinum resistance still limits its efficacy. the nuclear receptor coactivator family  and the p <dig> steroid receptor coactivator family  in gastric cancer cells exhibit significant differences in interactions observed in the igecn than in normal cells. it has been proposed that src <dig> plays an important role in intrinsic resistance to platinum therapy in cancers  <cit> . the results revealed that dysregulation of ncoa <dig> is transduced by signaling cascades via promyelocytic leukemia  and runx <dig>  which is transcriptionally regulated by v-ets erythroblastosis virus e <dig> oncogene homolog  <dig> . it has been suggested that ets <dig> plays an important role in regulating gastric cancer cell invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis  <cit> . because runx <dig> is essential for the development of human hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> , we proposed that pml is a potential drug target that can overcome platinum resistance in the platinum-based chemotherapy in gastric cancer. it has also been suggested that pml mediates glioblastoma resistance to the mammalian target in rapamycin-targeted therapies  <cit> . two pharmaceutical drugs, arsenic trioxide and retinoin, potentially target pml to overcome platinum resistance in gastric cancer. hepatocellular carcinoma 



dysregulations of dna methylation and mir <dig> contribute to dysfunction of dna damage response in hcc
hcc frequently occurs in the context of chronic disease that promotes dna damage and chromosomal aberrations  <cit> . recently, it has been found that the overexpressed mir <dig> results in extensive dna damage  <cit> , and jmjd1c and tp <dig> are the components of dna-damage response pathway with implications for tumorigenesis  <cit> . the accumulated alterations in the dna-damage response pathway could trigger hepatocarcinogenesis  <cit> . in this study, we identified that the  <dig> genetic and epigenetic regulations, including the gain of the mirna regulation of mir <dig> to jmjd1c  and the genetic regulation of tp <dig> to gadd45a  in cancer cells, and dna methylations of jmjd1c and gadd45a, led to not only changes of gene expression profiles of jmjd1c  and gadd45a  but also changes of dna methylation profiles of jmjd1c  and gadd45a  between human normal liver cells and liver cancer cells . the changes also resulted in the gain of ppi between jmjd1c and gadd45a  in hepatocarcinogenesis. therefore, we suggested that the dysregulations of dna methylation and mir <dig> give rise to dysfunction of dna damage response in hcc.

dysregulation of mir <dig> contributes human hcc cell proliferation
recently, it has been proposed that down-regulation of ptpmt <dig> is sufficient to trigger cancer cell death  <cit> , and trim <dig> participates in regulating cell proliferation in the development of cancer  <cit> . we identified that the change in the mirna expression profile of mir <dig>  results in the significant change in the gene expression profile of ptpmt <dig>  between normal liver cells and liver cancer cells . the expressions of trim <dig> and ptpmt <dig> were significantly activated in hcc. the significant genetic alterations of trim <dig>  and ptpmt <dig>  and their interaction  in hcc promote aberrant proliferation. therefore, we suggested that dysregulation of mir <dig> contributes human hcc cell proliferation.

dysregulation of mir302a contributes to not only microvesicle-mediated transfer of mirnas but also dysfunction of nf-κb signaling pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis
it has been identified that microvesicles transfer mirna between cells and alter biological functions by affecting signaling pathways in hepatocarcinogenesis  <cit> . microvesicles are enriched with maladjusted mirnas, which could regulate zinc finger proteins. we identified that the change in the mirna expression profile of mir302a  leads to the change in the gene expression profile of teashirt zinc finger homeobox  <dig>  , also known as zinc finger protein  <dig> , between normal liver cells and liver cancer cells . the expression change of tshz <dig> further contributes to the change in the gene expression profile of tnf receptor-associated factor  <dig>  , which mediates the dysfunction of the nuclear factor-kappa b  signaling pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis. the dysregulated nf-κb signaling pathway results in hcc angiogenesis and metastasis  <cit> . suppression of traf <dig> inhibits the proliferation of several cancer cells  <cit> , and the oncogene in epithelial cancers, traf <dig>  contributing to the dysregulated nf-κb signaling pathway has been also identified  <cit> . therefore, dysregulation of mir302a contributes to not only microvesicle-mediated transfer of mirnas but also dysfunction of nf-κb signaling pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis.

dysregulation of the hormone receptors, esr <dig> and ar, contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis
the most recent study proposed that menopause, which results from growing estrogen deficiency and physiological aging, increases risk of immune system disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, and imbalance between antioxidant formation and oxidative stress  <cit> . the physiologic and biochemical changes in those functions have a direct effect on liver function and mediate the development of liver disease. in this study, we identified two hormone receptors, estrogen receptor  <dig>  and androgen receptor , which were involved in multiple changes in intracellular signaling cascades. the gene expression profile of esr <dig> showed the change  between young and old normal liver cells, and the change  between young normal liver cells and young liver cancer cells . the relatively small change in the gene expression profile of esr <dig>  between old normal liver cells and old liver cancer cells implicates that the gene expression change of esr <dig> could be necessary but not sufficient for hepatocarcinogenesis. the significant change in the gene expression profile of ar not only between young normal liver cells and young liver cancer cells  but also between old normal liver cells and old liver cancer cells  implicates that the gene expression change of ar may be required for hepatocarcinogenesis. the result can be supported by the most recent study in hepatocarcinogenesis  <cit> . hiv- <dig> infection



the signaling cascade from mir <dig> to sumo <dig> contributes to hiv- <dig> infection to hijack cd4+ t cells through dysfunction of the immune and hormone pathways at early stage
owing to the available hiv- <dig> mrna gene expression data at middle and late infection stages and the lack of hiv- <dig> protein expression data, the impact of hiv- <dig> proteins on the host cells cannot be identified, directly. in this study, we identified the igecns at early, middle, and late infection stages , including the largest differences in the mirna regulation and hiv- <dig> protein interactions at the middle and late stages between normal and infected cells. at early infection stage , we identified that the expression changes of mir <dig>  and general transcription factor iii   contribute to the expression change of small ubiquitin-like modifier  <dig>   via respectively regulating zinc finger protein  <dig>   and dead  box helicase  <dig>  x-linked  . by comparing mirna expression profiles between the wildtype hiv- <dig> infected human cemx <dig> lymphocytes and tat rna silencing suppressor in hiv- <dig> infected human cemx <dig> lymphocytes  <cit> , tat rna silencing suppressor contributed to the expression change of mir <dig> . it has been also proposed that tat can induce mir <dig> to control inflammatory responses  <cit> , and tat can also control gtf2i expression during hiv infection  <cit> . additionally, it has been also reported that sumo modification of znf <dig> suppressed estrogen signaling  <cit> , and hiv transcription was suppressed by inducing estrogen signaling  <cit> . therefore, we suggested that the hiv infection leads to dysregulation of immune and hormone pathways to hijack cd4+ t cells.

dysregulation of mir34c-5p and mir449a contributes to the frequency of latent hiv infection
moreover, we also identified that the expression changes of mir34c-5p , and mir449a  contributed to the expression changes of tata binding protein-associated factor  <dig>   via mirna regulations . it has been suggested that the genetic and epigenetic regulations in tata protein binding may control the frequency of latent hiv infection  <cit> . therefore, we suggested that genetic and epigenetic regulations in taf <dig> also contribute to control hiv infection at early stage.

dysregulation of mir139-5p contributes to hiv- <dig> replication via dna hypermethylation
at the intermediate hiv infection stage, we identified that the expression change of mir139-5p  contributes to the expression change of ddx3x  via mirna regulation . the expression of ddx3x was also activated at the intermediate hiv infection stage. therefore, we suggested that ddx3x could regulate hiv replication through mir139-5p regulations  <cit> .

dysregulation of mirlet7i contributes to dysfunction of the immune response and viral replication
it has been reported that the hiv- <dig> vif/vpr protein is essential for viral replication  <cit> . we determined that the vif/vpr protein is regulated by mirlet7i  and interacts with the human stat <dig> protein  . therefore, the expression change of mirlet7i  leads to the expression change of vif/vpr protein  during the intermediate hiv infection stage. it was supported by the previous observations that mirlet7i has high homology to hiv- <dig> sequences   <cit>  and the immune response of t cells induced by the vpr-stat <dig> interaction was involved in regulating hiv- <dig> replication  <cit> . moreover, by comparing mirna expression profiles between the wildtype hiv- <dig> infected human cemx <dig> lymphocytes and vif/vpr rna silencing suppressor in hiv- <dig> infected human cemx <dig> lymphocytes  <cit> , vif/vpr rna silencing suppressor contributes to the expression change of mir7i . therefore, we proposed that the mirna regulation of mirlet7i to the vif/vpr protein is involved in the induction of the immune response and viral replication .

dysregulation of mir10a contributes to dysfunction of immune response in cd4+ t cells and viral replication
at the second infection stage, we determined that mir10a regulates hiv- <dig> proteins including gag/pol , which significantly interacts with small subunit  processome component, homolog   , also known as hiv- <dig> rev binding protein  <dig>  . therefore, the expression change of mir10a  contributes to the expression change of gag/pol . it has been reported that krr <dig>  an evolutionarily conserved gene, is essential for viral replication  <cit> . additionally, mir10a is involved in the regulation of immune response in cd4+ t cells  <cit>  and coxsackievirus group b type  <dig>  replication  <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that the copy number of loci belonging to the mirlet <dig> family and mir10a is correlated with hiv- <dig> viral load during viral infection  <cit> . therefore, we proposed that dysregulation of mir10a is involved in hiv- <dig> replication via post-transcriptional regulation of hiv- <dig> 

dysregulation of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> to hiv- <dig> budding and releasing through dna hypermethylation, ubiquitin transfer, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation at the virus assembly/budding infection stage
the final steps of hiv- <dig> replication are virus assembly and budding. it has been proposed that the hiv- <dig> gag protein is involved in the regulation of these steps  <cit> . at the late infection stage, we determined that regulation of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> to gag  results in dysfunction of the infected cells through a signaling cascade of  <dig> proteins, prmt <dig>  inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate receptor type  <dig> , autocrine motility factor receptor , tripartite motif containing  <dig> , and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2n  . the  <dig> genes were also highly expressed in hiv-1-infected t cells. therefore, the expression changes of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  contributed to the expression change of gag . we proposed that dna methylation-associated proteins including prmt <dig> and ube2n contributes to virus release from hiv-1-infected cells to dysregulated uninfected cells through aberrant hypermethylation of host target genes  <cit> . it has been also suggested that mir <dig>  <cit> , and mir <dig>  <cit>  induce aberrant dna hypermethylation in the hepatitis b virus infection. moreover, ubiquitin transfer is required for efficient hiv- <dig> release during the final step of viral replication. therefore, we suggested that the ube2n-associated ubiquitin transfer is induced by a signaling cascade leading to dysregulation of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  additionally, we also found that itpr <dig> is induced to regulate hiv- <dig> infectivity through endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we proposed a new method to construct igecns for describing cellular mechanisms by system dynamic modeling and large-scale database mining of ngs data. furthermore, we applied the method to identify differences in the igecns between normal and cancer cells to investigate carcinogenesis, and between hiv-1-infected and non-infected cells to investigate pathogenic and defensive mechanisms at the reverse transcription stage, integration/replication stage, and virus assembly/budding stage based on omics databases and ngs data. database mining provided all possible candidates for genetic and epigenetic regulatory effects and interactions in the igecns related to cellular functions. we used aic and statistical assessment to prune the false-positive regulatory effects and interactions by applying the dynamic coupling model to ngs data. finally, we compared the major differences in igecns between different biological conditions to identify mechanistic differences to explore the evolution of cellular mechanisms. based on these network comparisons, we examined how genetic and epigenetic regulation mechanism affects gastric tumorigenesis, hepatocarcinogenesis, and the progression of hiv- <dig> infections in cd4+ t cells. therefore, the proposed igecn construction method allowed us to unravel cellular network mechanisms from genetic and epigenetic mechanisms using omics databases and ngs data. a cancer hallmark network framework has been proposed  <dig> cancer hallmark networks, including angiogenesis-inducing network, mutating network, dedifferentiation network, emt  network, genome duplication network, immune-escaping network, survival network, metabolic network, and stroma-network  <cit> . by comparing the hallmark network difference between normal and cancer cells, cancer clonal evolution and clinical phenotypes, which will have impact on diagnosis and personalized treatment, can be predicted.
