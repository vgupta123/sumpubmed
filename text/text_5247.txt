BACKGROUND
antimetabolite toxins are generally small metabolites that exhibit strong effects in plant cells by causing an increase in disease symptoms  <cit> . various toxic substances produced by pathovars of pseudomonas syringae have been well characterised. each antimetabolite toxin inhibits a specific step in the glutamine and arginine biosynthesis pathways of the host, enhancing disease symptoms and increasing the virulence of the bacterial pathogen. the most well-studied antimetabolite toxins are tabtoxin and phaseolotoxin  <cit> .

tabtoxin is a monocyclic β-lactam that specifically inhibits the enzyme glutamine synthetase . this toxin is produced by p. syringae pv. tabaci, pv. coronafaciens and pv. garcae  <cit> . the biosynthetic pathway of tabtoxin is not well understood, and tabtoxin biosynthesis may diverge from the lysine biosynthetic pathway prior to the formation of diaminopimelate  <cit> . a genetic analysis of tabtoxin production revealed the presence of biosynthetic genes at the att site adjacent to the lysc trna gene in pseudomonas syringae br <dig>  <cit> . the various orfs within this region include sequences similar to β-lactam synthase, clavaminic acid synthase and enzymes involved in amino acid synthesis. additionally, novel orfs were identified in a portion of the biosynthetic region that is known to be associated with a toxin hypersensitivity phenotype  <cit> .

phaseolotoxin is produced mainly by p. syringae pv. phaseolicola and pv. actinidae. the molecular structure of phaseolotoxin includes a sulphodiaminophosphinyl moiety linked to a tripeptide of ornithine, alanine and homoarginine  <cit> . phaseolotoxin inhibits ornithine carbamoyltransferase   <cit> . the phaseolotoxin homoarginine and ornithine residues are synthesised by a transamidation reaction that requires arginine and lysine  <cit> .

aguilera et al.  <cit>  have reported a biosynthetic cluster, pht, which is composed of  <dig> genes flanked by insertion sequences and transposases, that is involved in the biosynthesis of phaseolotoxin. mutations of  <dig> of the genes within the cluster led to a tox- phenotype, and the mutation of three additional genes resulted in low levels of toxin production. preliminary results also indicated that the product of phtl may be involved in the regulation of phaseolotoxin biosynthesis  <cit> .

pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae  is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause canker, blossom blights and leaf spots in more than  <dig> different plant species, many of which are of economic importance  <cit> . strains of this pathovar can cause bacterial apical necrosis on mango trees, limiting mango production in the mediterranean area  <cit> . more than 86% of the pss strains isolated from mango tissues produce mangotoxin, an antimetabolite toxin that inhibits ornithine n-acetyl-transferase , a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of arginine  <cit> . mangotoxin also acts as a virulence factor that increases the necrotic symptoms of pss strains during the infection of plant tissues  <cit> . in a previous study, a dna fragment from pss, umaf <dig>  was cloned into pcg2- <dig> and sequenced , revealing a cluster of  <dig> orfs that included the mgoa gene. our group identified mgoa as the first p. syringae pv. syringae gene known to be directly involved in mangotoxin production  <cit> . this gene encodes a putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase , and its inactivation by insertional mutagenesis abolishes mangotoxin production and drastically reduces virulence  <cit> . the genetic organisation of the three remaining genes and their roles in the production of mangotoxin remain unknown. the goal of our current study is to determine the organisation of the four orfs in this cluster  and their relative importance in the production of mangotoxin.

RESULTS
the gene cluster containing mgoa may constitute an operon composed of four orfs. our current study provides insight into the organisation of the operon and the involvement of the genes in the production of mangotoxin.

the construction and characterisation of insertion mutants derived from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae umaf0158
each orf that was cloned into plasmid pcg2- <dig>  was subjected to insertional inactivation mutagenesis in the p. syringae pv. syringae umaf <dig> chromosome by integration of the appropriately cloned pcr products. the orfs were 92%-98% identical to the homologous genes in p. syringae pv. syringae strain b728a . the deduced orf <dig> and orf <dig> protein products are homologous to proteins of the had hydrolase family and aldo-keto oxidoreductases, respectively. the mutation of these orfs by insertional inactivation did not affect mangotoxin production. orf <dig> is located just upstream of the putative mgo operon  and contains a putative ribosomal binding site  at nucleotide - <dig> . this gene is 97% identical to psyr_ <dig> from p. syringae pv. syringae b728a , pspto_ <dig> from p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> and pspph_ <dig> from p. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a. the protein products of the genes from each of these bacteria were annotated in the database as members of the gntr family of transcriptional regulators  <cit> . when orf <dig> was disrupted, the corresponding mutant umaf0158::orf <dig> still produced mangotoxin .

the four genes downstream of orf <dig> exhibit a high degree of identity to four consecutive p. syringae pv. syringae b728a genes  . the mgob gene, which contains a putative rbs at nucleotide - <dig> , is 96% similar to psyr_ <dig>  which encodes a conserved hypothetical protein. the mgob mutant umaf0158::mgob produced mangotoxin , although the level of mangotoxin was decreased slightly . a search of the pfam database revealed a similarity to duf <dig>  a protein of unknown function, between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> with an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  searches in the interproscan  database revealed that the theoretical mgob protein product is similar to the haem oxygenase-like, multi-helical superfamily between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> .

the inactivation of the mgoc, mgoa and mgod genes yielded mutants  that were completely unable to produce mangotoxin . the mgoc gene, which contains a putative rbs at - <dig> , exhibits 95% similarity to the psyr_ <dig> gene of p. syringae pv. syringae b728a, a conserved hypothetical protein . homology searches for the mgoc protein product in the pfam database revealed a significant match with the p-aminobenzoate n-oxygenase aurf from streptomyces thioluteus. the alignment was between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> with an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  the disruption of mgoa by insertion  or minitn <dig>  mutation resulted in the complete inactivation of a putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase . the inactivation of mgoa has previously been shown to result in defects in mangotoxin production and considerably reduced virulence  <cit> . however, a putative rbs for mgoa could not be located using the consensus sequences published to date. finally, insertional mutagenesis of the mgod gene, which contains a putative rbs at - <dig> , resulted in the inactivation of a conserved hypothetical protein that is 94% identical to psy_ <dig>  a conserved-domain analysis of the hypothetical amino acid sequence of mgod revealed sequence similarity to polyketide_cyc <dig>  a polyketide cyclase/dehydrase and lipid transporter domain, from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  the e-values were 1e- <dig>  and  <dig> e- <dig> .

the genetic organisation of the mgo operon and complementation of insertional mutants
to define the mgo operon and determine its genetic organisation and co-transcription, reverse-transcription pcr  experiments were performed . the total dna and rna from wild-type umaf <dig> grown in pms minimal medium at 22°c were used, and the rt-pcr primers were designed to anneal between the orfs. the total dna was used as an amplification control, and the cdna derived from the mrna was used to detect the transcripts of genes belonging to the putative mgo operon. to confirm the co-transcription of mgob, mgoc, mgoa and mgod, we amplified the connecting areas between the sequential orfs of the putative mgo operon . sequences within orf <dig> and mgob were also amplified to determine their mrna transcripts . our results indicated that orf <dig> and the upstream region and mgob and the downstream region were amplified. however, there was no amplification of the inter-genetic region upstream of mgob. these results suggest that the transcriptional unit is mgob, mgoc, mgoa and mgod . the lack of amplification between orf <dig> and mgob supports the presence of a putative promoter in this dna sequence.

additional rt-pcr experiments showed that only the disrupted mgob gene was not amplified in umaf0158::mgob while the transcripts of the disrupted mgoc gene as well as that of the downstream genes were absent in umaf0158::mgoc . a hybridisation analysis of the transcript of the mgo operon with the total mrna from wild-type umaf <dig> and the insertional mutants umaf0158::mgob, and umaf0158::mgoc showed that the transcript was present in the wild-type strain and reduced in the mgob mutant strain .

to confirm the role of these genes in mangotoxin production and to analyse the specific phenotype of each mutation, we performed a complementation analysis using plasmids containing all of the genes that were situated downstream of the mutations . the mgo genes were cloned downstream of the plac promoter. plasmid plac <dig>  which contains the structural genes of the operon , and a plasmid containing the genomic clone pcg2- <dig> were both able to restore mangotoxin production in all of the constructed mutants . these results demonstrate that the complemented plasmids were functional and rule out the possibility that secondary mutations influence mangotoxin production. plasmid plac <dig>  which contains only mgoa and mgod, was able to complement the phenotypes of the minitn <dig> mutant umaf0158-6γf <dig> and the insertional mutants umaf0158::mgoa and umaf0158::mgod. plasmid plac <dig>  however, was only able to complement umaf0158::mgod . these complementation experiments show that the insertional mutants umaf0158::mgoc, umaf0158::mgoa and umaf0158::mgod were unable to produce mangotoxin even when the downstream genes were restored on a plasmid. the insertional mutation of the mgoc, mgoa and mgod genes resulted in a loss of mangotoxin activity, which did not occur when mgob was mutated . therefore, we cannot eliminate the possibility that a polar effect of the insertional mutations affected the phenotypes of the mutants and downstream genes transcription. apparently the insertional mutation in mgob did not show polar effect on mgo genes located downstream , in contrast with the insertional mutation in mgoc, which produce a polar effect on mgo downstream genes transcription .

mangotoxin production in mutants derived from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae umaf0158
to further support our results, we determined the amount of mangotoxin production in the insertional and minitn <dig> mutants relative to wild-type umaf <dig> . the production of the syringomycin complex by the insertional mutants confirmed that only mangotoxin production was affected . the results obtained from the quantitative mangotoxin analysis indicated that the two minitn <dig> mutants that were complemented with pcg2- <dig>  umaf2-6a and umaf2-6-3h <dig>  and the insertion mutant umaf0158::orf <dig> were able to produce mangotoxin at the same level as wild-type umaf <dig> 

upon complementation with plac <dig> , mangotoxin production was restored in the mutants umaf0158::orf <dig> and umaf0158::mgob and the minitn <dig> mutant umaf0158-6γf6; however, the production was slightly lower and could be detected only until a 1: <dig> dilution .

promoter and terminator localisation in the mgo operon
promoter expression and terminator localisation experiments were performed to characterise the structure of the operon.

the promoter prediction software bprom  was used to identify possible promoters in the putative mgo operon. the best candidates were found in the nucleotide sequence  of the non-coding region located upstream of the mgob gene. two possible promoters were predicted and designated as pmgo. the first predicted promoter was located at position  <dig> from 5'-end with a linear discriminant function  of  <dig> , a - <dig> box, cgtttttat, at position  <dig>  and a - <dig> box, tcgcca, at position  <dig> . the second predicted promoter was located at position  <dig> from the 5'-end of the sequence, with an ldf of  <dig> , a - <dig> box, tgataaatt, at position  <dig>  and a - <dig> box, ttaaaa, at position  <dig>  . the scores of the first predicted promoter were lower than those of the second promoter. according to the in silica prediction, the  <dig> bp sequence containing both putative promoters was cloned into pmp <dig>  and its activity was measured with a β-galactosidase assay   <cit> . the pmgo studies were performed in pseudomonas fluorescens pf- <dig>  which contains no genomic sequences that are homologous to the mgo operon, and p. syringae pv. syringae b728a, which contains genomic sequences that are homologous to the mgo operon but cannot produce mangotoxin. we also used the insertional mutant umaf0158::orf <dig>  which contains a disruption in the putative transcriptional regulator gene, and wild-type umaf <dig>  pmgo activity was measured in three different culture media  and at two growth temperatures . in the minimal medium pms, the pmgo promoter was active in the wild-type strain at both temperatures and in the insertional mutant at 22°c . the β-gal assays of the strains grown in rich lb and kb media did not indicate activity in any of the strains at either temperature .

once the presence of promoter activity in the analysed sequence was confirmed, the 5'race method was used to determine the transcript start point of the mgo operon . with this method, we could determine which of the two putative promoters of the mgo operon was the functional promoter and also analyse the presence of an additional promoter between mgob and mgoc, which was suggested by the results of the polarity and mangotoxin production experiments. the start point of the transcript  was located  <dig> nucleotides after the predicted - <dig> box of the second putative promoter . therefore, the second predicted promoter appears to be the functional promoter for the mgo operon. at this point using the known nucleotide sequence and the 5'race results, alternative - <dig> and - <dig> boxes were located in correct positions from nucleotide + <dig>  the sequences of these alternative - <dig> and - <dig> boxes are more typical of pseudomonas sigma70-dependent promoter sequences  <cit>  than the predicted boxes by bprom software, which are similar to escherichia coli sequences . additionally, the results do not support the presence of an alternative promoter at the end of mgob, which could explain the previous results.

the location of the transcriptional terminator was then determined. a 118-bp sequence was located in the region downstream of the mgo operon  and was compared with the equivalent dna segment in pss b728a by blast . a putative terminator , which was 100% identical to the equivalent terminator in pss b728a, was identified at position  <dig> from the mgod stop codon. this terminator sequence was then analysed by foldrna software , a program used to predict rna secondary structure through energy minimisation, to calculate the free energy released during palindrome structure formation. a value of - <dig>  kcal/mol was found in 84% of the helices. the entire sequence of  <dig> bp was also analysed by findterm software  to locate putative rho-independent bacterial terminators. two putative terminators  were found, the first  of which contained more apparent poly-u tracts typical of rho-independent terminators . t <dig> was located at position 20- <dig> , and t <dig> was located at position 75- <dig> , which includes the sequence homologous to the b728a terminator. both terminator sequences had negative free energy values, indicating that their folding would be favoured and spontaneous. finally, to determine which putative terminator acted as the functional terminator, rt-pcr experiments were performed by amplifying the 3'-end of the transcript with primers designed to anneal before, in the middle of and after of the putative terminators . the amplification test of the mgo transcript revealed that the t <dig> sequence but not the t <dig> sequence was included in the mgo transcript, indicating that t <dig> is the functional terminator of the mgo operon.

the hypothetical function of the mgo operon
our study of the mgo locus demonstrates that the mgo operon is involved in the biosynthesis or regulation of mangotoxin. recent studies of the pvf genes, which share high homology with the mgo operon, have indicated a possible regulatory function for those genes  <cit> . given these findings, it should be possible to isolate a signalling molecule that is required for virulence gene expression and use it to restore the virulence of an mgoa mutant  by adding this molecule to the growth medium. growing the umaf <dig> mutant, which possesses a deletion of mgoa  and is defective in mangotoxin production, in media supplemented with an extract from wild-type umaf <dig> restored mangotoxin production. an extract from the mgoa mutant did not restore toxin production. strains that were defective in other regulatory genes were also used. extracts from wild-type pss umaf <dig> and the reference strain pss b728a were used to complement umaf0158-2βb <dig>  which contains a minitn <dig> disruption of the gaca gene, and umaf0158-3αe <dig>  which contains a minitn <dig> disruption of the gacs gene . mangotoxin production was restored in the defective mutants when an extract from umaf <dig> was added. by contrast, an extract from pss b728a only restored mangotoxin production in the gacs mutant . these results suggest a possible regulatory role for the mgo operon.

discussion
the focus of the present study was to characterise the transcriptional organisation that is directly involved in mangotoxin production. we had previously identified the mgo operon   <cit> . we determined which genes are involved in mangotoxin production by disrupting each chromosomal gene that was previously identified in pcg2- <dig> by mutagenesis. the disruption of orf <dig> and orf <dig> did not affect mangotoxin production. these two genes may belong to another independent gene cluster located close to the mgo operon that is not involved in mangotoxin production. orf <dig> transcription was independent of the mgo operon, and orf <dig> is homologous to the gntr family of transcriptional regulators. this family of regulatory proteins consists of the n-terminal hth region of gntr-like bacterial transcription factors. an effector-binding/oligomerisation domain is usually located at the c-terminus  <cit> . in the deposited genomes of other p. syringae pathovars, the genes in this family are often located close to gene clusters that are homologous to the mgo operon. the relationship between orf <dig> and the regulation of the mgo operon remains unclear. in the present study, we observed promoter pmgo expression in the orf <dig> mutant  when it was grown in minimal medium at 22°c but not at 28°c, in agreement with the production of mangotoxin by the orf <dig> insertional mutant. these data suggest that orf <dig> is not involved in mangotoxin production but provide no direct information on the possible influence of orf <dig> on the mgo operon with respect to variations in temperature.

our results demonstrate that the dna sequence downstream of orf <dig> constitutes an operon. ma et al.  <cit>  first established the correlation between the presence of a shine-dalgarno sequence, also known as a ribosomal binding site , and translational initiation, the expression levels of the predicted genes and operon structure  <cit> . we found putative rbss in almost all of the genes in the putative mgo operon. only the mgoa gene, in which the start codon overlaps with the stop codon of mgoc, does contain a potential rbs sequence. mgoc and mgoa may share the same rbs, and post-translational changes may separate the two proteins; this situation could explain the absence of a putative rbs for the mgoa gene. the mutagenesis and bioinformatics analysis of each gene in the mgo operon provided insight into their relationship to mangotoxin production. the disruption of mgob did not abrogate mangotoxin production; however, the production decreased noticeably compared with the wild-type strain. protein domain searches indicated that mgob is similar to haem oxygenase. this enzyme is a member of a superfamily represented by a multi-helical structural domain consisting of two structural repeats that is found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic haem oxygenases and in proteins that enhance the expression of extracellular enzymes  <cit> . the disruption mutants of the next three genes, mgoc, mgoa and mgod, were unable to produce mangotoxin, indicating that these genes are essential for mangotoxin production. a similar conclusion was reached by aguilera et al.  <cit> , who obtained tox- phenotypes when  <dig> different genes in the pht cluster, a region involved in phaseolotoxin production, were mutated by insertion, indicating that all of the genes located within this region encode proteins that are required at different stages of phaseolotoxin production, including synthesis, transport and regulation  <cit> .

the sequence analysis of mgoc prompted us to search the superfamily protein domains, revealing a similarity to the n-oxygenase domain. this domain was identified in the protein prnd, which is derived from the pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis gene cluster of pseudomonas fluorescens. mgoc is also similar to aurf from streptomyces thioluteus, which produces the starter unit p-nitrobenzoic acid  for the polyketide synthase of the aureothin biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . the gene mgoa, which is homologous to non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, is the largest gene in the mgo operon, and its disruption produces a mutant that is defective in mangotoxin production. its structure, participation in mangotoxin production and influence on the virulence of the wild-type bacterium has been discussed previously  <cit> . the final gene studied was mgod; a domain localisation analysis indicated that mgod could be a polyketide_cyc <dig> belonging to the star-related lipid-transfer  domain superfamily. the start superfamily includes bacterial polyketide cyclase/aromatases and two families of previously uncharacterised proteins that are present only in plants and the cyanobacterium prochlorococcus  <cit> .

after analysing the elements that composed the putative mgo operon, we evaluated whether the four genes were transcribed together in a single transcript. rt-pcr experiments using the wild-type rna showed that the four genes were connected in the single transcript . moreover, the transcript size was analysed by hybridisation, which confirmed the presence of a single transcript with a sufficient size  to contain the genes mgobcad; however, the exact size of the transcript could not be determined.

following the identification of the mgo operon, the promoter and transcription terminator were identified and studied. the in silico analysis of the sequence identified two putative promoters. promoter activity was detected only in a minimal medium, the same culture medium that is traditionally used for antimetabolite toxin assays  <cit> . promoter activity occurred in the wild-type strain at both temperatures and in the orf <dig> insertion mutant at 22°c only. the other pseudomonas spp. experimental strains, which do not produce mangotoxin, did not exhibit any β-gal activity. the promoter activity in the wild-type strain was more intense at 28°c than 22°c. when the promoter activity was assayed at 22°c, the activity of the mutant umaf0158::orf <dig> was statistically comparable with that of the wild-type strain. these results suggest a possible influence of orf <dig> on the mgo operon during its regulation in response to temperature variations. the promoter inactivity in the other two strains of pseudomonas spp. may be due to the absence of genes homologous to the mgo operon in p. fluorescens pf- <dig>  but this explanation is not applicable to pss b728a. the sequence in b728a that is homologous to the mgo operon is composed of genes that are orthologous to the mgo genes; theoretically, the promoter activity should have been similar to that of the wild-type strain, but it was not. this result suggests that there are additional genes that are necessary for mangotoxin production that are not present in b728a. in support of this explanation, additional genes involved in mangotoxin production have been identified in umaf <dig> and cloned into a different vector than pcg2- <dig>  <cit> . the initial sequence analysis did not show any identity with the genome of b728a, and thus these additional genes may influence mgo promoter activity.

finally, the functional promoter of the mgo operon was established by locating the start of the mgo transcript , which is located  <dig> nucleotides after the putative - <dig> box of the second promoter analysed in silico. thus, the first putative promoter was eliminated as a functional promoter of the mgo operon. once the + <dig> site was established, it was possible to locate additional - <dig> and - <dig> boxes, which were typical of sigma <dig> dependent promoters of pseudomonas spp  <cit>  and were more closely related than the predicted - <dig> and - <dig> boxes by bprom software developed for escherichia coli, which are less accurate in the search for promoters of pseudomonas spp. these results allowed us to determine the functional promoter of the mgo operon. the mgo operon terminator was found in a similar manner. the in silico analysis of the sequence identified two possible terminator sequences between the 3'-end of mgod and the 5'-end of the 5s rrna, both of which exhibited secondary structures typical of transcription terminators. we considered that the ribosomal transcript terminator is also likely present in the analysed sequence. rt-pcr was used to clarify which was the operon terminator, establishing t <dig> as the functional terminator of the mgo operon. this is a typical terminator with a stable hairpin having many gc pairs followed by a string of t's. so, it seems that the t <dig> terminator is a bifunctional terminator, serving this dna region to terminate transcription of mgo operon in the sense strand and of the ribosomal operon in the antisense strand .

the results described above are sufficient to suggest that mgobcad is a transcriptional unit and therefore propose that mgo is an operon. if this argument is correct, mutations in each mgo gene should lead to the absence of a transcript for the downstream genes. a polar effect was demonstrated for umaf0158::mgoc but not umaf0158::mgob. the mutation in mgob did not prevent the transcription of the downstream genes, although the hybridisation experiments revealed that the transcription appeared to be less efficient. this reduction in transcription corresponds to the reduced production of mangotoxin by umaf0158::mgob relative to the wild-type strain. therefore, the results obtained with wild-type umaf <dig> and the insertional mutants of mgoc, mgoa and mgod support the hypothesis that the mgo genes form an operon in contrast, the results with the mutant umaf0158::mgob do not. we also evaluated the possible existence of an alternative promoter after the mgob gene, which would explain the production of mangotoxin by the mutant umaf0158::mgob. however, during 5'race experiment  only a single transcription start site was located, eliminating the possibility of another promoter downstream of mgob. therefore there must be something different between the mutant and wild-type strain, which is probably the plasmid integration. in reviewing the process by which the mgo mutants were obtained, we observed that umaf0158::mgob was not easy to obtain. the size of mgob is  <dig> bp, and the cloned sequence in pcr <dig>  was  <dig> bp of mgob. the integration of pcr::mgob into mgob occurred by single-crossover homologous recombination as it was confirmed. during this process, the plasmid could be integrated into mgob sequence maintaining an important part of the gene. in this circumstances mgob or sufficient fragment of it, and the remarkably other three genes of the mgo operon, could be under the influence of a promoter located in plasmid polylinker, lacz promoter, allowing a reduced transcript expression  and mangotoxin production . to determine the insert position, a pcr was performed in which the forward primer annealed to the lacz gene  and the reverse primer annealed to the 5'-end of the mgoc gene, with wild-type umaf <dig> used as the negative control. the amplicon obtained from the mutant umaf0158::mgob had a size of  <dig> bp, confirming that the plasmid pcr::mgob was integrated and the lacz promoter is close to mgob fragment .

because the chemical structure of mangotoxin is unknown  <cit> , it is difficult to establish a hypothesis concerning the role of the mgo genes in mangotoxin biosynthesis or to determine whether they are related to the regulation of mangotoxin production. recent studies in p. entomophila have focussed on the pvf gene cluster, which is homologous to the mgo operon, and suggest that the gene cluster serves as a regulator of certain virulence factors in pathogenic strains of pseudomonas spp. the pvf gene cluster may be a new regulatory system that is specific to certain pseudomonas species  <cit> . in the present study, extract complementation restored mangotoxin production in the umaf0158Δmgoa mutant only when the culture medium was supplemented with an extract from wild-type umaf <dig>  polar effects of the deleted mgoa on mgod expression were excluded because the construction of the deletion mutant preserved the reading phase of protein translation. mangotoxin production was restored in the minitn <dig> mutants, which contain disrupted regulatory genes, when their cultures were complemented with a wild-type extract. these results are in agreement with the results obtained by vallet-gely et al.  <cit> , in which pvf and gac mutants were complemented by a wild-type extract. these results allow us to propose a putative regulatory role for the mgo operon in secondary metabolite production by p. syringae pv. syringae, in accordance with vallet-gely et al.  <cit> .

to fully characterise the functions of the mgo operon, more data concerning the chemical structure of mangotoxin and a characterisation of the other genetic traits that regulate mangotoxin biosynthesis by p. syringae pv. syringae umaf <dig> are required.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the organisation of the mgo operon in p. syringae pv. syringae umaf <dig> was characterised. the mgo operon is composed of four genes, mgob, mgoc, mgoa and mgod. additionally, this operon possesses one active promoter and a terminator. the last three genes are essential for mangotoxin production, as insertional mutation of these genes results in a loss of mangotoxin production. this operon is only active in minimal medium, in agreement with the standard process for mangotoxin production. moreover, experiments performed to determine the functional role of the mgo operon demonstrated a putative regulatory function in the production of mangotoxin.
