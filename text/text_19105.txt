BACKGROUND
prokaryote genomes are considered compacted genomes with only small fractions of their genomic dna assigned to intergenic regions  <cit> . the percentage of these non-coding regions varies across the prokaryote species, and does not depend on genome size or gene content, even though the latter variables strongly correlate  <cit> . the spacers between a pair of genes were divided into three types according to their transcriptional direction: i) unidirectional, ii) convergent and iii) divergent  <cit> . here we use the co-directional term rather than the unidirectional one. these three types of spacers differ in the type of regulatory signals they contain. in prokaryotes, most of the co-directional genes are involved in operons  <cit> . the spacers between these genes may contain translational signals such as the shine-dalgarno  sequence. the intergenic spacers between convergent genes may contain terminators for both genes while the divergent ones have only promoters and other upstream transcriptional signals. the different types of intergenic regions in prokaryotes, including the convergent and divergent ones  and the co-directional ones , evolve under the same evolutionary pressures. selection pressure  <cit>  and deletional bias  <cit>  have been proposed as the main forces responsible for minimizing the amount of non-functional dna in prokaryote genomes. deletion bias is the mechanism that shapes the prokaryote genomes, while selection pressure may establish an equilibrium with deletional bias in order to maintain minimally required amounts of non-coding dna. these minimally required amounts of non-coding sequences are required to accommodate essential regulatory signals  <cit>  and dna replication sequences  <cit> . according to the genomic compactness, prokaryote genomes have intergenic distances that are much shorter than gene lengths and relatively shorter than those in eukaryote genomes  <cit> . eukaryote genomes have a much wider range of genome sizes and contain protein-coding genes that are typically interrupted by introns and have longer intergenic regions.

one of the regulatory sequences affected by the short distances between prokaryote genes is the sd sequence. in  <dig>  shine and dalgarno found a sequence  at the 5' of the initiation codons in several messenger rnas  of escherichia coli that was complementary to the 3'-ccucca-5' sequence located at the tail of the 3'-end of the 16s ribosomal rna   <cit> . it has been suggested that a strong sd sequence, though not mandatory in translation initiation, may compensate for a weak start codon and counteract mrna secondary structures that hinder access to the start codon  <cit> . although the genes with a sd sequence are widely found in prokaryote genomes, previous studies have also shown that there is a significantly and previously underestimated population of genes without a sd sequence  <cit> . moreover, the exponential increase of the fully sequenced genomes has provided thousands of examples of leaderless genes or genes without a sd sequence in prokaryote genomes  <cit> . it has been suggested that the leaderless genes could use an independent pathway in their gene translation, while leader genes without a sd sequence must use alternative unknown mechanisms in their translation initiation  <cit> .

among the genes that have a sd motif, the ribosome does not need a perfect distance between the sd sequence and the start codon for the initiation of translation. however, when the sd sequence is located within four or as far as  <dig> nucleotides from the start codon, the gene expression decreases dramatically  <cit> . therefore, there are apparently structural constraints that require an optimal space between the sd motif and the start codon. this sequence has mainly been found  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the start codon  <cit> . taking this into account, the intergenic distances are an important feature of the prokaryote genomes that may correlate with the sd presence  <cit> . many genes are sufficiently close together that the end of one gene may overlap the sd sequence or the coding sequence of the next gene. eyre-walker and bulmer showed that there is a change in composition at the end of genes, which is consistent with selection against the formation of mrna secondary structures around the sd sequence  <cit> . eyre-walker also showed that the strength and location of the sd sequence do not vary significantly because of the close proximity of the prokaryote genes  <cit> . it seems, therefore, that the spacing lengths and stop codon usage adapt themselves to the presence of sd. recently, in the fusellovirus ssv <dig>  which has a compactly organized genome, a preference for the tga stop codon has been found in genes that overlap their stop codon with the sd sequence of the next gene to form the pattern ggtga as a sd motif  <cit> . in prokaryotes, it seems that some intergenic distances are less favored because of the presence of the sd sequence. a certain stop codon usage is therefore required to form the sd motifs, as has been described in viruses. in this paper we assess how the presence of the sd sequence affects the spacing lengths between adjacent genes and the stop codon usage.

RESULTS
spacing lengths between prokaryote genes
the distribution of the spacing lengths among the three gene orientations is different. this is probably due to the different gene structures found in each orientation . the co-directional number of pairs found in each spacing length decreases as the spacing length increases, though a long spacing length tail is observed . the average spacing length among co-directional pairs is the lowest  and the modal spacing length is  <dig> bps. the short modal spacing length reflects the fact that co-directional gene pairs tend to be grouped in operons and separated by short distances  <cit> . however, the long tail distances and the average spacing lengths of the co-directional pairs suggest that among the prokaryote genomes there is also a small minority of co-directional pairs that may be non-operonic. we have noticed that some prokaryote genomes have long intergenic regions that may be the result of pseudogenes accumulated in prokaryote genomes undergoing processes such as niche change, host specialization or weak selection strength  <cit> . the longest spacing lengths are found in mycobacterium leprae and in the rickettsia genomes, which appear to be in a process of extensive genome degradation via pseudogenization  <cit> .

the convergent number of pairs in each spacing length decreases as the spacing lengths increase, as happens in co-directional spacing lengths, but the tail is much longer for long distances . however, there is a noticeable increase in the number of pairs at a spacing length of around  <dig> bps that may be related to the presence of terminators, but this increase is not addressed in this paper. although the modal spacing length is similar to the co-directional distribution , the higher mean of the convergent spacing lengths  indicates that these spacing lengths tend to be longer than co-directional ones, probably because the convergent gene pairs are basically inter-operonics. in contrast, the distribution of the divergent spacing lengths is totally different. the divergent number of pairs increases gradually to around  <dig> bps and remains high at around  <dig> bps before decreasing gradually with a long tail for long distances between genes . the divergent distribution shows the highest mean of the spacing lengths  and a modal spacing length of  <dig> bps. these results indicate that the divergent gene pairs, like the convergent ones, are basically inter-operonics. however, they require a longer space between them than the convergent and co-directional pairs, probably because of the need to accommodate several upstream regulatory signals for both genes of the pair  <cit> . maintaining the upstream regulatory signals therefore seems to constrain the compression of the dna more than the operon structures or termination signals. note also that the convergent spacing lengths appeared to follow a phase bias, at least among the short ones  . this phase bias is the result of the continuous creation and elimination of overlaps among the closely spaced genes. this uneven distribution of small separation distances is caused by the non-uniform distribution of reverse-complement stop codons  <cit> . phase  <dig> , which is prevalent, has the highest concentration of stop codons. neither co-directional nor divergent pairs show any phase bias.

insights into the short spacers between co-directional genes
we focused on the fluctuations within the short co-directional spacing lengths . apparently, there is a decrease in the co-directional gene pairs separated by spacing lengths of around  <dig> to  <dig> bps . to confirm such fluctuations we fit a smoothed decay function of the form  

to the observed distribution of co-directional spacing lengths x . we obtained values a =  <dig> . <dig> and b = - <dig>  for the parameters by fitting a least-squares regression line to the logarithm of the values in the histogram of observed spacing lengths over the range x =  <dig> .. <dig> . we used a function of this form because we expected an exponential drop-off due to the large number of short spacing lengths between co-directional genes and because of the selective pressure to reduce the non-coding dna content  <cit> . the combination of these facts may contribute to an exponential distribution of the spacing lengths, with a peak around short spacers and an exponential decay. by comparing the expected number of pairs with the observed number of pairs in every spacing length, we found three areas that provide relevant biological information . the intergenic lengths from  <dig> to  <dig> bps and from  <dig> to  <dig> bps showed an overrepresentation of the number of pairs but from  <dig> to  <dig> bps the number of pairs dropped off. beyond  <dig> bps, the number of pairs observed for every spacing length was more similar to the expected number. to investigate these fluctuations, we studied the three areas mentioned above and included two others for the purpose of comparison. these extra areas were the spacing lengths beyond  <dig> bps and the whole spacing lengths. despite the tendency towards a reduction in non-coding dna, genomes must maintain a spacer between co-directional genes that should be long enough to accommodate the sd sequence. the presence of a sd sequence may therefore influence the length of the spacers because it is usually located between the upstream gene stop codon and the downstream gene start codon of the pair, while a proper distance between the sd sequence and the downstream gene start codon is maintained  <cit> .

sd presence within the prokaryote genomes
to detect the presence and location of the sd sequence we used an approach based on free energy calculations . the genomes that have more genes with a predicted sd sequence belong to the firmicutes phylum, especially the bacillales species, and listeria innocua clip <dig> is the genome that has the most genes with a predicted sd sequence . the genome that has the fewest genes with a predicted sd sequence is the bacteroidetes species flavobacterium psychrophilum jip02/ <dig>  . as other authors have pointed out  <cit> , the fact that the number of genes with a sd sequence varies from  <dig> % to  <dig> % implies that the populations of leaderless genes or genes without a sd sequence are really significant. moreover,  <dig> of the  <dig> prokaryote genomes analyzed here have less than 50% of their genes with a predicted sd sequence and around  <dig> have fewer than 20% of their genes with a predicted sd sequence . this could indicate that some prokaryote genomes use alternative translation initiation processes to translate their genes. finding alternative processes to the sd-guided process is a still-unresolved issue.

genomes that have a large number of genes with a predicted sd sequence seem to concentrate such a regulatory motif in a distance that ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> bps before the start codon . this range is slightly different from the one previously defined   <cit> . the difference is due to the fact that we are calculating the distance from the base that binds the 5'a of the 16s rrna tail sequence 3'-ccucca-5' to the first base of the start codon  <cit> . other authors calculate the difference from the core of the sd sequence to the start codon and obtain longer distances. for genomes with very low percentages of sd presence, the distance range between the sd and the start codon is more scattered. also, as the percentage of genes with a sd sequence decreases, the number of potential mispredicted start codons or downstream start codon reflections  increases, though the correlation is low . it appears, therefore, that prokaryote genomes, whose translation initiation process is mainly guided by the sd motif that binds the ribosome, conserve an optimal space between the sd motif and the start codon that can vary slightly depending on the species.

location of the sd motif within the short intergenic spacers between co-directional genes
we studied the presence or absence of the sd sequence within the co-directional gene pairs separated by the various ranges of spacing length. the set containing all the gene pairs has a  <dig> % sd presence . the percentage is similar for the set of gene pairs separated by spacers over  <dig> bps  . although the translation in prokaryotes is mainly guided by the sd sequence that can bind the ribosome  <cit> , it seems that the number of genes with sd sequence is only slightly higher than those without sd sequence. these results support the idea that non-sd-led genes are as common as sd-led genes  <cit> . the sd sequence of gene pairs separated from  <dig> to  <dig> bps should be along the end of the coding sequence of the previous gene. although, as eyre-walker found  <cit> , this constrains the 3'-end of the upstream gene, we found a higher number of genes with a predicted sd sequence and separated from the previous one by a spacing length from  <dig> to  <dig> bps. in this spacing length range, the percentage of genes with a sd sequence is slightly higher  than in the total gene set . among the spacing lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bps we found the highest percentage of genes with a predicted sd sequence  . this may indicate that among the spacing lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bps, we generally find the optimal distances among genes that allow a least constrained accommodation of the sd motif, which is usually 4- <dig> nucleotides from the start codon in prokaryotes . on the other hand, among spacing lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> bps, we observed a decrease in the number of genes with a predicted sd sequence  . it appears, therefore, that genes with a sd sequence may preferentially have an intergenic distance to the previous gene shorter than  <dig> bps  or longer than  <dig> bps . among the intergenic spacers from  <dig> to  <dig> bps the sd motif of a gene overlaps the previous stop codon, thus constraining the spacing length and stop codon usage of the previous gene. for longer intergenic distances, spacing lengths below  <dig> bps between co-directional genes are associated with genes belonging to the same operon  <cit>  and the sd presence is significantly higher in genes within operons  <cit> . in fact, we found that co-directional genes separated by intergenic spacers below  <dig> bps have a higher percentage of genes with a predicted sd sequence than genes without one, while for intergenic distances above  <dig> bps the percentages are similar .

the optimal distance range between the sd sequence and the start codon can vary depending on the genome  and this could vary the frequency of the short intergenic spacers. the distribution of distances between co-directional genes also varies among the taxonomical groups . for each phylum, some distances are more frequent and others are less frequent within the short distances between co-directional genes. the less frequent distances are: from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in acidobacteria, aquificae and proteobacteria; from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in actinobacteria, deinococcus-thermus and euryarcheota; from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in chloroflexi, crenarchaeota, cyanobacteria, chlorobi and spirochaetes; from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in bacteroidetes; from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in synergistetes; from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in firmicutes; from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in thermotogae; and from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in chlamydiae. there is no clear range in planctomycetes. in general, it seems that the least frequent distances between co-directional genes are around  <dig> bps among all phylums except planctomycetes and synergistetes. the most represented phylums -- proteobacteria, euryarchaeota, firmicutes and actinobacteria  -- were selected to perform an anova analysis in order to determine whether the taxonomy and distances between co-directional genes could affect the presence of the sd sequence . we observed significant differences among the distances  and phylums analyzed . we performed a post hoc test to determine among which groups such differences exist  and observed significant differences from  <dig> to  <dig> bps and from  <dig> to  <dig> bps . this could be because the intergenic spacers from  <dig> to  <dig> bps accommodate the sd sequence best, while the presence of a sd sequence makes spacers from  <dig> to  <dig> bps less frequent. with regard to the phylums we observed significant differences between firmicutes and actinobacteria , between firmicutes and proteobacteria , and between firmicutes and euryarchaeota . this could be because firmicutes tend to have a longer range of less-favored distances between co-directional genes . the presence of underrepresented short distances and overrepresented short distances seems to be general among prokaryote genomes, though the less frequent and more frequent short distances vary across the species.

adaptation of the stop codon usage and spacing lengths to the presence of the sd sequence
the termination codons in the standard genetic code are taa, tga and tag. taa is the preferred stop codon in prokaryotes because of the greater availability of taa-cognate release factor or lower levels of translational readthrough  <cit> . it has been reported that taa is used in preference to tga, which itself is used in preference to tag  <cit> . the stop codons tga and tag may be used when they have an additional function to coding for a stop signal  <cit> . for example, the tga stop codon is used in one of the extremely common overlaps found in prokaryotes, the co-directional overlap of  <dig> bps, which includes the tga stop codon of an upstream gene and the start codon of a downstream gene   <cit> . the ratio of the taa stop codon to the sum of the tga and tag stop codons in each range of spacing lengths is close to  <dig>  except for genes separated from  <dig> to  <dig> bps , whose ratio is  <dig> . it appears, therefore, that an upstream gene separated by 5- <dig> bps to the next one more frequently uses tga or tag as the stop codon . also, the sd presence of the downstream gene decreases within these spacing lengths . this adaptation of a gene's stop codon usage could be caused by the sd sequence of the next gene overlapping its stop codon. the stop codons tga and tag may fit more easily within the sd motif. in a virus, whose genome is highly compacted, it was recently reported that overlaps of a stop codon and the sd sequence resulted in a common motif ggtga. this is a clear adaptation of the upstream gene stop codon usage, which becomes part of the sd motif and maintains its function as stop codon.

to study the possible adaptation of the stop codon usage and spacing lengths to the sd presence among the short spacers between co-directional genes, we built sequence logos for the intergenic regions of escherichia coli k <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> bps . in e. coli k <dig> the number of adjacent genes separated by spacing lengths from  <dig> to  <dig> bps and from  <dig> to  <dig> bps is overrepresented, while from  <dig> to  <dig> bps it is underrepresented. from  <dig> to  <dig> bps we observed a high proportion of as and gs before the upstream stop codon, which may indicate the presence of a sd sequence along the end of the upstream gene coding sequence . from  <dig> to - <dig>  a drop in the Δg° value is observed before these regions with a high frequency of as and gs. the stop codon usage is biased to the taa use and the proportion of genes with a predicted sd sequence and without a predicted sd sequence is higher than  <dig> in each spacer . from  <dig> to  <dig> bps we found few genes with a sd sequence to build the logo . in fact, there are more genes without a predicted sd sequence than with a predicted sd sequence in genes separated by these spacing lengths . therefore, the  <dig> and the  <dig> bps distances are the ones most compromised by the presence of the sd sequence. from  <dig> to  <dig> bps the high frequency of as and gs suggests that the sd sequence is overlapping the downstream gene stop codon and there is a drop in Δg° value just before the stop codon . interestingly, the sd sequence seems to adopt the tgagg pattern when the e. coli k <dig> genes are separated by  <dig> or  <dig> bps . from  <dig> to  <dig> bps the high frequency of as and gs is between the upstream gene stop codon and the downstream gene start codon. the drop in Δg° value is around the middle of the intergenic region and the taa stop codon is used in preference. in fact, this stop codon could bind well with the end bases of the e. coli k <dig> 16s rrna tail , especially for a length of  <dig> and  <dig> bps .

number of genes with a sd sequence and without a sd sequence in each spacing length from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in the e. coli genome.

when the sd sequence overlaps the upstream coding sequence or stop codon, its strength and relative distance to the downstream start codon do not vary significantly . however, the presence of a sd sequence may make the intergenic lengths from  <dig> to  <dig> bps less frequent and cause an adaptation of the stop codon usage. in e. coli k <dig> this adaptation is reflected in the prevalence of tga usage forming the tgagg pattern for co-directional genes separated by  <dig> or  <dig> bps. however, the adaptation could be slightly different depending on the prokaryote species. for instance, in the b. subtilis genome with less frequent intergenic lengths from  <dig> to  <dig> bps, the co-directional genes separated by  <dig> bps use tag rather than tga as the stop codon. this results in the sd motif taggagg . there is a drop in the average of the free energy values just before this pattern, which indicates a strong binding of this sd pattern with the fragment of the b. subtilis 16s rrna tail, 3'-uuccucc-5' . on the other hand, for the archaea thermococcus kodakarensis the sd pattern is ggtga, which is described as a common sd pattern among archaeas  <cit> . in this pattern, the stop codon tga is involved in the sd pattern, which could be responsible for binding the fragment of the t. kodakarensis 16s rrna tail, 3'-ccacu-5' . in the archaea, the drop in the average of the free energy values is on the t of the tga stop codon .

two mechanisms may cause the sd sequence to overlap with a tga or tag stop codon. the first involves the deletion of a portion of an intergenic sequence followed by a mutation at the upstream stop codon that changes the most frequent taa stop codon to tga or tag. the second involves a single step -- the deletion of a portion of an intergenic sequence when the stop codon of the upstream gene is already a tga or tag. this second mechanism is the more parsimonious of the two.

CONCLUSIONS
among co-directional genes, the intergenic spacers from  <dig> to  <dig> bps are the least frequent because the sd sequence overlaps the previous stop codon. in this case the strength and relative distance of the sd sequence to the downstream start codon do not vary significantly. however, the sd sequence may be slightly different from the canonical sd motif . not all stop codons may overlap with a sd sequence. the least frequent stop codons  fit better within a sd sequence. therefore, a variation of the stop codon usage takes place when the length of the next spacer is from  <dig> to  <dig> bps and this spacer contains a sd motif. our results introduce new elements in the discussion of which factors other than the pressure of genome compaction may affect the length of intergenic regions in prokaryotes.
