BACKGROUND
septins were first identified in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae where they have been very well-characterized  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae five septins, cdc3p, cdc10p, cdc11p, cdc12p and shs1p, polymerize to form a ring at the mother-bud neck where they are important for bud site selection and cytokinesis. two other yeast septins, spr3p and spr28p, are expressed during sporulation  <cit> . yeast septins have been shown to function as a scaffold organizing the division site and coordinating nuclear and cellular division. septins have also been shown to act as a barrier, preventing diffusion of rna and proteins between mother and daughter cells  <cit> . though not as well-characterized as those in yeast, septins in other fungi also appear to organize sites of cell division and new growth  <cit> . septins have been found in a variety of animal tissues. in addition to acting as a diffusion barrier, animal septins are implicated in vesicle trafficking, apoptosis and cell movement  <cit> . in mammals septins appear to regulate membrane and cytoskeleton organization and abnormal septins have been linked with cancer and neurodegeneration  <cit> .

septins are p-loop gtpase proteins  <cit> . p-loop gtpases, including kinesin, myosin and ras proteins share at least five conserved motifs designated g <dig> to g <dig> within the gtp-binding domain  <cit> . the g <dig> motif, defined by the consensus element gxxxxgk , forms a flexible loop which interacts with the phosphate group of the nucleotide  <cit> . the g <dig> motif is conserved within individual gtpase families, but not across the whole class  <cit> . the g <dig> motif contains several hydrophobic residues followed by dxxg  <cit> . this region binds mg2+ and can interact with β and γ phosphates of gtp  <cit> . the g <dig> motif, nkxd, is important for gtp binding specificity  <cit> . the g <dig> motif is found in some, but not all, members of the p-loop gtpase class  <cit> .

septins clearly contain the g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> motifs  <cit>  . septins purified from drosophila, xenopus and saccharomyces have been shown to bind or hydrolyze gtp though the biological significance of these activities and the specific functions of these motifs are not yet clear  <cit> . n-terminal to the gtpase domain, septins contain a polybasic region that has been shown to bind phosphoinositides  <cit> . c-terminal to the gtpase domain, a  <dig> amino acid septin element conserved among many septins has been previously identified  <cit> . most septins also contain a c-terminal extension predicted to form coiled-coils and shown to be needed for interactions between certain septins  <cit> .

previously fungal septins were placed into groups based on phylogenetic analysis  <cit>  and mammalian septins were placed into groups based on primary sequence similarity  <cit> . kinoshita  <cit>  used phylogenetic analysis of two fungal yeast species and three animal species to conclude that orthologous relationships existed within fungal or animal septins, but not between fungal and animal septins making it impossible to compare model fungi and less tractable animals  <cit> . recent genome projects provide an excellent opportunity to better understand the evolutionary relationships of septins. here we identify  <dig> septins from  <dig> fungi, microsporidia and animals. based on phylogenetic analysis we place the septins into five groups, two of which clearly contain orthologous fungal and animal septins. we also present three modified gtpase motifs, four new motifs and six individual amino acid positions which have been conserved among fungal, microsporidial and animal septins. our results suggest that it should be possible to apply lessons learned from a subset of septins in model organisms to septins from mammals.

RESULTS
database searches identified  <dig> septin-related sequences
we used the cdc3p sequence of saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the best-studied septins, to query genbank with the psi-blast program and detected  <dig> sequences. from the psi-blast list we identified  <dig> unique potential septin sequences based on an e-value lower than e- <dig>  the presence of the g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> gtpase motifs and other sequence similarities . in our designation, the first three letters represent the species from which the sequence came . three septin sequences appeared to be truncated and were eliminated from further consideration . we individually checked each of the remaining  <dig> potential septin sequences for the presence of the gtp_cdc domain  <cit> .

three of the  <dig> sequences were predicted to have only half of the gtp_cdc consensus domain and were designated "septin-like"  . in addition to septin sequences, our psi-blast search with the cdc3p query returned myosins and kinesins. a phylogenetic tree was built with representative septins, myosins, kinesins and ras gtpase family proteins to determine the relationship of the septin-like sequences to other gtpases. the three septin-like sequences did not group with any of the other gtpase superfamilies examined . a blast search with the septin-like sequences did not give significant hits from any known protein families. this suggested that the septin-like sequences represent either ancient or diverged septins, or that they belong to an unknown protein family that shares some motifs with septins. the septin-like sequence found in giardia lamblia is potentially illuminating for the evolution of this protein family because of giardia's position as a basal eukaryote.

the remaining  <dig> potential septin sequences grouped within a clade clearly separated from the other gtpase clades . we designated these  <dig> sequences septins. after our psi-blast search we became aware of two additional septins, human sept  <dig>  and ustilago maydis cdc <dig> , through reading of the literature  <cit> . we included these sequences for a total of  <dig> septins. consistent with previous reports, we found septins in animals and fungi, but not in plants. three septins were also found in the microsporidium encephalitozoon cuniculi. we used a septin from e. cuniculi  to query genbank with psi-blast a second time, and did not find any new potential septins.

phylogenetic analysis
bayesian analysis of all septins
to investigate the evolutionary history of the septin gene family, we used the mrbayes program  <cit>  to construct a phylogenetic tree for all  <dig> septins, rooting the tree with the s. cerevisiae myosin myo2p. the septins could be grouped into five major clades . two clades contained fungal and animal septins  ; two clades contained fungal and microsporidial septins ; one clade contained only fungal septins  . group  <dig> consisted of two subgroups, 1a and 1b. subgroup 1a further partitioned into one fungal clade and one animal clade supported by  <dig>  credibility. the animal septins in group 1a were closer to fungal cdc10-type septins than to other animal septins. group1a provides the strongest evidence for orthologous relationships between fungal and animal septins, suggesting the ancestral septin that gave rise to members of group 1a originated before the fungal/animal split. orthologous relationships between fungal septins in group 2a and animal septins in group 2b were supported with  <dig>  credibility. group  <dig> contained fungal and microsporidial septins. though the credibility for group  <dig> was only  <dig> , all sequences except spospn <dig>  fell within a large clade with  <dig>  credibility suggesting that the ancestral septin which gave rise to group  <dig> arose before the fungal/microsporidial split. group  <dig> also contained fungal and microsporidial septins. though it had a moderate credibility score of  <dig> , sequences from group  <dig> consistently fell within this clade. the small clade containing microsporidial septins ecusep <dig> and ecusep <dig> and fungal septin calspr <dig> had  <dig>  credibility suggesting that the ancestral septin which gave rise to group  <dig> also arose before the fungal/microsporidial split. group  <dig>  the smallest group, contained septins solely from filamentous fungi. the lack of orthologs from budding or fission yeast suggests that group  <dig> septins either arose early in fungal evolution and were lost from yeasts or arose relatively late in fungal evolution.

fungal septins
ascomycetes with completed genome sequences had five to eight septins while basidiomycetes had four or five . all fungi had single group  <dig> and group  <dig> septins. in contrast, at least some fungi had multiple group  <dig>  group  <dig> and group  <dig> septins. in particular, ascomycetous yeasts had three group  <dig> septin paralogs. u. maydis and eremothecium gossypii are the only two filamentous fungi in our study that lacked a group  <dig> septin.

animal septins
in the animals with completed genomes, nematodes had two or three septins, insects had four or five, fish had six and mammals had twelve or thirteen septins . all animal septins fell within groups  <dig> or  <dig>  with group 2b often showing the most expansion. the nematode caenorhabditis elegans contained one septin from group 1b and one from group 2b. c. briggsae also had a single group1b septin, but contained two group 2b septins. the insect anopheles gambiae contained a single group 1b septin and three group 2b septins, while drosophila melanogaster had an additional group 1b septin. the zebrafish danio rerio contained a septin from group 1a along with two septins from group 1b and three from group 2b. the mammals mus musculus and rattus norvegicus contained three group 1a septins and five group 2b septins. homo sapiens contained three group 1a septins and six group 2b septins. m. musculus and r. norvegicus had five group 1b septins while h. sapiens had four group1b septins. martinez and ware previously divided mammalian septins into groups designated i-iv  <cit> ; those groups fell within our groups 1a, 1b and 2b as indicated in figure  <dig> 

microsporidial septins
e. cuniculi, the single microsporidium with a completed genome included in our study, had three septins. e. cuniculi contained a single group  <dig> sequence and two group  <dig> sequences. in contrast to all fungi and animals in our study, e. cuniculi contained no sequences from groups  <dig> or  <dig> 

validation of tree topology using maximum likelihood
maximum likelihood non-parametric bootstrapping is not ideal for large datasets; bootstrap values decrease as the taxon number increases  <cit>  and the fast bootstrap methods without branch-swapping typically applied to large datasets may not be reliable at nodes with weak support  <cit> . none-the-less, because the nodes near the base of our bayesian tree were weakly supported, we also constructed a phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood methods. we used the phyml program with  <dig> bootstrap replicates to construct a phylogenetic tree with all  <dig> septins. the maximum likelihood tree gave the same basic tree topology as the bayesian tree. for groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> maximum likelihood support values were similar to bayesian support values . for group  <dig> the likelihood support value was higher than the bayesian value . for group  <dig> the likelihood support value was much lower than the bayesian support value . however, support for groups 1a and 1b was very similar by both methods .

proposed names
many of the septins we identified are listed as hypothetical proteins in genbank or have been named after less related septins. we propose to name septins after the most closely related well-characterized septin within the same group . the clades upon which proposed names are based are strongly supported and far from the base of the tree . using this system, fungal and microsporidial septins from groups 1– <dig> would be named cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  shs <dig>  spr <dig> or spr <dig> after the most closely related s. cerevisiae septin and those from group  <dig> would be named aspe after the a. nidulans septin. the only exception would be fungal septins from s. pombe, which would continue to be called spn1- <dig> because cell division cycle mutants bearing the cdc name, but not correlating to the s. cerevisiae numbers, have been isolated independently. mammalian and fish septins from groups  <dig> and  <dig> would be named sept1- <dig> after the human septins. nematode septins would be named unc <dig> and unc <dig> after the c. elegans septins and insect septins would be named pnut, sep <dig>  sep <dig>  sep <dig>  and sep <dig> after d. melanogaster septins.

domains and motifs
to identify common motifs, we aligned all  <dig> septins and analyzed sequence patterns using the weblogo program  <cit> . in the following sections, septin amino acid positions are referenced to cdc3p of s. cerevisiae.

gtpase domains
the g <dig> motif  was the most conserved among the septin motifs . glycines  were found in the first and sixth position in 99%–100% and in the fourth position in 94% of septins. either k or r occupied the seventh position in 98%. all animal septins, all group 1a fungal septins and all group <dig> septins had a perfect consensus g <dig> motif. eight fungal and microsporidial septins from groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had derivatives of the consensus g <dig> motif . our analysis also revealed that the two positions immediately following the g <dig> motif  were   in 96%–97% of septins . a prosite search using the extended g <dig> as query also identified other gtpases, so this extended g <dig> motif is not septin-specific.

the two consensus amino acids in the established gtpase g <dig> motif  were found in 83%–94% of septins. our analysis also showed that the g <dig> motif consensus for septins could be further modified to dt gxg  with each additional position conserved in 86%–93% of septins . modified g <dig> motifs were found in all groups except for the animal and fungal group 1a .

in the g <dig> gtpase motif  n <dig> was often replaced by a, s, or g. k and d  were found in 91% and 99% of septins, respectively. perfect g <dig> consensus sequences were found in animal group 1b and fungal groups 2a and  <dig> and in fungi in group 1a. derived g <dig> motifs were found in fungal groups  <dig> and  <dig> and in animal members of group 1a and 2b. we also detected the pattern nxxpxi  immediately upstream of the established g <dig> motif, with each of the three conserved amino acids in 91%–98% of septins. a prosite search using this extended g <dig> pattern as query identified other gtpases, so it is not septin-specific.

coiled-coil domains
the coiled-coil is a common structural motif that forms a super helix with heptad repeats and mediates protein-protein interactions  <cit> . it exists in a broad range of proteins involved in numerous cellular processes  <cit> . coiled-coil motifs have previously been identified at the c-terminus of the s. cerevisiae septins cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> where they are required for septin association and function  <cit> . a c-terminal coiled-coil has also been identified in cdc <dig>  but it is dispensable for function. cdc <dig> is shorter than the other s. cerevisiae septins and lacks the c-terminal coiled-coil. we analyzed all  <dig> septin sequences for predicted coiled-coil domains using the coils  <cit>  and multicoil programs  <cit> . every member of the fungal group 2a  and the closely related animal group 2b contained a predicted coiled-coil domain . similarly, all members of the fungal and microsporidial group  <dig>  contained the predicted coiled-coil. none of the animal or fungal septins in group 1a  had a predicted coiled-coil, while all the animal septins in the sister clade group 1b  had a predicted coiled-coil. none of the nine septins in the filamentous fungal group  <dig>  were strongly predicted to have the coiled-coil; however, ncrhyp <dig>  mgrhyp <dig>  cnehyp <dig> and gzehyp <dig> had weakly predicted coiled-coil domains . though most members of the fungal and microsporidial group  <dig>  had a predicted c-terminal coiled-coil, five of the twenty-nine septins in group  <dig> had no predicted coiled-coil . interestingly, theascomycetes that have a group  <dig> septin lacking a predicted coiled-coil contain two other group  <dig> paralogs with predicted coiled-coils. however, the microsporidium e. cuniculi has only a single group  <dig> septin.

new septin motifs
the weblogo program assigned bitscores to amino acids in the established g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> gtpase motifs ranging from a low of  <dig>   to a high of  <dig>  . by considering relative frequency and using positions with bitscores above  <dig> , we identified four new septin motifs and designated them sep1-  <dig>  and six new conserved single amino acid positions . the sep <dig> motif, exxxxr  is located between the established g <dig> and g <dig> domains  with each of the two consensus amino acids conserved in 96–98% of septins. a prosite search of the ncbi protein database using the sep <dig> motif returned many proteins that were neither septins nor gtpases. the sep <dig> motif, dxr hxxx f xp  is located between the g <dig> and g <dig> gtpase domains . each consensus amino acid was present in 88%–96% of septins. a prosite search with the sep <dig> motif identified only septins, but not all septins, making this motif potentially useful for identification of new septin sequences. four septins with a p rather than a v or i at position  <dig> are all in the scespr <dig> subclade of group <dig>  the sep <dig> motif, gxxlxxxd , is between the g <dig> and g <dig> gtpase domains . each consensus amino acid was present in 86%–96% of septins. a prosite search with the sep <dig> motif returned gtpases including septins. in position  <dig>  the hydrophobic l is often conservatively replaced by i or v. only members of group <dig> have the charged residue d at  <dig>  the sep <dig> motif, wg , is in the c-terminus within the previously identified "septin unique element" and before the coiled-coil . the amino acids at these two positions were conserved in 92% of septins. a prosite search with the sep <dig> motif showed that it was also found in some other gtpases and hence is not septin-specific.

in addition to the four septin motifs, we detected six positions that contained single consensus amino acids in 86%–94% of septins . one of these positions, upstream of the g <dig> gtpase motif in the polybasic region , had a g in 99% of animal septins. in fungal septins it was moderately conserved except for four of the group  <dig> septins where a p was substituted. the remaining five conserved single amino acid positions were after the g <dig> motif . in position  <dig>  94% of septins had the acidic residues d or e. however, in five septins from group  <dig> the basic h residue was substituted.

splice variants
mammalian septins exhibit complex expression patterns and can produce a large number of splicing variants  <cit> . the human septin, sept <dig>  spans a  <dig> kb region, contains  <dig> exons, and is predicted to have  <dig> different transcripts encoding  <dig> polypeptides  <cit> . all of the conserved positions identified in our study were predicted to be retained in all variants encoded by sept <dig>  indeed, all splicing of human septin transcripts so far reported occurs in the regions encoding n- or c- termini and not in the regions encoding the conserved core of the protein.

discussion
evolution
the origin of the septins in eukaryotes depends upon the interpretation of the septin-like sequence we found in giardia lamblia. if this is considered a primitive septin, then a septin-like ancestor existed before the diplomonads arose. this septin-like ancestor was retained in the diplomonads, animals, fungi and microsporidia, but lost in plants. if the g. lamblia septin-like sequence is part of a separate gtpase family that shares some motifs with septins, then septins may have entered the common ancestor of animals, fungi and microsporidia via a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria, as proposed by leipe  <cit> .

which ever origin is correct, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that septins might have evolved as follows : the ancestral septin sequence duplicated before the divergence of animals and fungi to become the ancestral group  <dig> and group  <dig> septins. the ancestral group  <dig> septin duplicated and one paralog lost the c-terminal coiled-coil extension. animals and fungi retained this shortened group  <dig> paralog which gave rise to group 1a septins. the longer paralog containing the c-terminal extension was lost from fungi, but retained in animals giving rise to group 1b septins. within fungal species there is a single group  <dig> paralog, however in many animals, especially mammals, extensive duplication gave rise to multiple group  <dig> paralogs. the ancestral group  <dig> septin was retained in both animals and fungi giving rise to group 2a and group 2b septins. fungi have single paralogs of group  <dig> septins, while most animals, especially mammals, have multiple paralogs. in the lineage leading to fungi and microsporidia, the ancestral group  <dig> and group  <dig> septins duplicated giving rise to group  <dig> and group  <dig> septins. unlike the single fungal paralogs of group  <dig> and group  <dig>  group  <dig> and group  <dig> septins duplicated and diverged, giving rise to multiple paralogs, especially in the ascomycetes. in the lineage leading to microsporidia, group  <dig> and group  <dig> septins were lost. this is consistent with recent views that microsporidia evolved from fungi  <cit> . group  <dig> septins, found only in filamentous fungi, either arose early in fungal evolution and were lost in yeasts or arose relatively recently.

motifs
polybasic domain and septin element
to be considered septin motifs, we required that sequences be at least as conserved as the gtpase motifs. while this stringent cut-off undoubtedly eliminated moderately-conserved or clade-specific sequences, it guaranteed the significance of identified positions. only one amino acid  within the ten amino acid polybasic region previously shown to bind phosphoinositides   <cit>  was conserved enough across all septins to be considered a septin motif in our analysis. similarly, only  <dig> amino acids  within the previously defined  <dig> amino acid "septin unique element"   <cit>  meet our cut-off for septin motifs.

gtpase
septins have been shown to bind and hydrolyze gtp  <cit> . many lines of evidence suggest that guanine-nucleotide binding by septins is needed for their polymerization; however, low rates of nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis in vitro have led to questions about the significance of the gtpase activity. consistent with the importance of guanine nucleotide binding for septin function, our analysis showed that the g <dig> gtpase motif, which forms the loop that interacts with the phosphate group of the nucleotide, and the g <dig> motif, which is important for gtp-binding specificity, were highly conserved, with  <dig> of  <dig>  septins matching the respective consensus sequences . in contrast the g <dig> motif, which binds to the mg2+ ion, matched the consensus for  <dig> of  <dig>  septins.

coiled-coil
in s. cerevisiae all septins except for cdc10p  are predicted to have a c-terminal region containing a coiled-coil, a motif implicated in protein-protein interactions. like cdc10p, all group 1a septins are missing the c-terminal region that contains the coiled-coil. group 1b septins are all predicted to contain c-terminal coiled-coils. in elegant work, versele and thorner  <cit>  showed that s. cerevisiae cdc3p and cdc12p associate through their c-termini and that cdc11p and cdc12p associate independently of their c-termini. in our analysis all group  <dig>  and group  <dig>  septins were predicted to contain c-terminal coiled-coils, while  <dig> of  <dig> group  <dig>  septins were not predicted to contain c-terminal coiled-coils. this pattern of conservation suggests that c-terminal coiled-coil interactions might be important for the association of all group  <dig>  septins with group  <dig>  septins while interactions outside the c-terminus might be important for the association of all group  <dig> with group  <dig> septins. animals lack group  <dig> septins, but group 1b septins likely play the same role in polymerization by interacting with group  <dig> septins. indeed, mammalian sept <dig>  and sept <dig>  have been shown to interact via their c-termini leading versele and thorner to suggest that the sept6–sept <dig> complex is the animal counterpart of the cdc3p-cdc12p complex  <cit> . group  <dig> septins, found in filamentous fungi, lack or have weakly predicted coiled-coils, suggesting that c terminal regions are not important for their interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed  <dig> septins from microsporidia, fungi and animals. septins were grouped into five classes, modified nomenclature based on these five classes was suggested and there was strong evidence for orthology between septins from different kingdoms. in addition to derivatives of already known g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> gtpase motifs, four new motifs and six conserved single amino acid positions were identified. though first discovered and best-studied in the yeast s. cerevisiae it has become increasingly clear that the septins are important in animals. earlier work based on septins from only five species suggested that there were no clear orthologs between the septins in fungal systems and those in mammals  <cit>  confounding extrapolation from simple to more complex systems. with the availability of many more sequences, our work clarifies the relationships among septins and points to which comparisons are likely to be most informative.
