BACKGROUND
the neurotrophin nerve growth factor  is essential for normal development of the embryonic nervous system  <cit> , and in adult animals it maintains the phenotype of aδ- and c-fibre nociceptors as well as sympathetic efferents  <cit> . ngf is produced in the target tissues that are innervated by ngf-dependent nerve fibres; in the skin for example, the major source of ngf is the proliferating layer of keratinocytes in the basal epidermis  <cit>  but fibroblasts, merkel cells and skeletal muscle also synthesize ngf  <cit> . intradermal and intramuscular injections of ngf cause persistent heat and mechanical hyperalgesia in humans  <cit>  and mutations in the high affinity ngf receptor trka  are associated with the rare condition congenital pain insensitivity with anhidrosis  <cit> .

ngf causes pain by temporally-distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, which have mostly been identified in inflammatory models of persistent pain  <cit> . initially, ngf directly sensitizes nociceptors  <cit> , probably the neuropeptide-containing c-fibre and aδ nociceptors, as the majority of them express trka receptors  <cit> . this is followed by later changes in protein transcription in the cell bodies of nerve fibres due to retrograde transport of ngf. there is increased synthesis of peptides  and ion channels  <cit> , and indirect effects on synaptic transmission in the spinal cord have also been described  <cit> .

as well as having a role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory pain, ngf has also been proposed to be important in neuropathic pain  <cit> . systemic administration of ngf neutralizing antibodies has anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic effects in several models of neuropathic pain  <cit> , although whether the effects of ngf neutralization occur centrally or peripherally is not known. one hypothesis is that excessive ngf in the periphery coupled with a reduced innervation density, which occurs in virtually all neuropathic pains with a peripheral origin, causes nociceptor sensitization via phenotypic changes, and ultimately chronic pain  <cit> . there is some support for this hypothesis in painful diabetic neuropathy  <cit> , where skin ngf levels are increased and systemic ngf antibodies reversed behavioural signs of neuropathic pain, but it is not known if this mechanism is specific to diabetic neuropathy. here we have investigated the relationship between ngf changes in the skin after partial nerve injury, the phenotype of intra-epidermal nerve fibres and how these relate to behavioural signs of neuropathic pain. we show that skin ngf levels are unchanged when there is neuropathic pain, and phenotypic alterations in skin nerve fibres are probably unrelated to ngf levels.

RESULTS
neuropathic pain after partial injury to the mental nerve
two animals were excluded from the experiment as they could not be trained to feed from the experimenter’s fingers. two other rats were excluded as they consistently displayed aversive responses to the weakest von frey hair pre-operatively, and it would have been impossible to identify mechanical hyperalgesia/allodynia post-surgery. dominant rats were trained the most rapidly. in one group of rats the most submissive individual would only perform the test with another rat in the cage. in this case the next most submissive rat was allowed in the cage during testing which proceeded with minimal interference.

there was usually very little or no grooming in response to cold stimuli in naïve rats. the typical aversive response to a cold stimulus was bilateral grooming of the chin. other responses including fast withdrawal and wiping the stimulated area on the cage floor were observed occasionally and these behaviours seemed to be more common after the cci, although they were not quantified. cold-evoked bilateral grooming increased significantly after cci , and was greater ipsilaterally . when compared to the contralateral side, significantly more grooming was evoked 11 days after the cci . p-values for ispilateral grooming duration on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> approached significance, but were not less than  <dig> . both sham-operated and animals with a ptl injury of the mental nerve showed no significant difference in grooming after cold stimultion . no grooming or other aversive reaction were ever evoked by application of a dry cotton bud  indicting that there was no confounding factor of tactile allodynia in nerve injured animals .

mechanical stimulation of the chin with noxious-intensity von frey filaments caused flinches or fast withdrawals from the stimulus. snatching the food from the experimenter’s fingers during testing could be mistaken for an aversive response, and if this occurred the food was immediately taken away by the experimenter to train the animals not snatch. cci  but not ptl  caused mechanical 50% withdrawal thresholds to change significantly after mental nerve injury : they were significantly higher on day  <dig> compared to threshold differences pre-injury . maximum threshold difference between sides on day  <dig> was  <dig>  g , but this was due to hypoalgesia contralaterally , rather than hyperalgesia ipsilaterally .

aversive responses to heat stimuli were fast withdrawals away from the radiant heat stimulus that had latencies of  <dig> – 12 s in unoperated rats. after cci, there was a transient increase in heat-evoked withdrawal latency ipsilaterally  at 6 days post-injury , whereas contralateral withdrawal latencies remained stable, thus indicating temporary heat hypoaesthesia on the operated side. there was no significant change in withdrawl latency to heat stimuli after either ptl injury to the mental nerve or a sham-operation .

skin  in neuropathic pain after partial nerve injury
because only animals with a cci of the mental nerve showed behavioural signs of neuropathic pain, the ptl injury model was not studied further. skin samples were obtained from animals that were killed on post-operative days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as these time points showed behavioural evidence of neuropathic pain. to enrich the study, tissue from rats that showed the largest differences between cold-evoked grooming behaviour on post-operative day  <dig> were selected for assay .

the average  in unoperated lip skin was 92 pg/mg  and there was no significant difference between sides . eleven days after mental nerve cci, when there was cold hyperalgesia behaviourally, skin  was significantly lower than in naïve and sham-operated controls  and this occurred bilaterally. over time  slowly increased bilaterally , so that by day  <dig> there was significantly more ngf in chin skin compared to naïve and sham-operated controls . there was significantly more ngf ipsilaterally compared to contralaterally 14 days after a cci, , contralateral: 69 ±  <dig>  pg/mg), but not after either  <dig>  or 21 days . compared to sham-operated animals on day  <dig>   was not significantly different  in cci rats. there was no significant change in ngf levels in sham operated animals over time .

density and phenotype of intra-epidermal nerve fibres
the innervation density and neurochemical phenotype of intra-epidermal nerve fibres  supplying the mental nerve territory were determined from samples obtained from the same animals that were used for assay of skin .

no neuronal structures could be seen either after omission of the primary antibodies or preabsorption of the antibodies with their immunogens . the stratum corneum was cy3-labelled in pre-absorption controls but not when the primary anti-cgrp antibody was omitted, this was presumably due to antibody cross-reactivity with keratin. sebaceous glands in the dermis were labelled in both positive and negative control experiments, and this was attributed to endogenous biotin within the glands  <cit> . hairs autofluoresced and were visible in either the fitc or coumarin channels in controls .

in unoperated  controls most ienfs were varicose and bead-like when labelled with pgp  <dig>  or cgrp, however approximately ⅓ formed a dense tangled ‘flower spray’ arrangement that was morphologically similar to the bush/cluster endings described by fundin et al.,  in the intervibrissial fur of the rat. in the present study these ‘flowerspray’ endings were virtually always trka-labelled . regardless of terminal morphology, all ienfs extended perpendicular to the basement membrane, and probably originated from tier  <dig> of the dermal plexus  <cit>  as they could not be followed in continuity to deeper tiers. occasionally a thicker dermal fibre was in close proximity to a ‘flowerspray’ ending, suggesting that some of this type of ienf ending may arise from tier  <dig> myelinated fibres  <cit> .

analysis of pgp  <dig> -labelling showed that the ienf density of control  skin was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fibres/mm . trka-labelled ienf’s had a density of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fibres/mm , whereas the density of cgrp-labelled ienf’s was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fibres/mm . the mean proportion of ienf’s that were trka-labelled was  <dig> % , and the mean percentage of trka-labelled fibres that were also cgrp-positive was  <dig> % ±  <dig>  ; the cgrp-labelled population comprised  <dig> % ±  <dig>  of the total ienf density . the mean number of branches on cgrp-labelled fibres was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

after cci, langerhans cells were more numerous and brightly labelled with pgp  <dig>  in just a few samples , but there was no obvious qualitative difference in their appearance compared to langerhans cells contralaterally. merkel discs at the base of the epidermis were occasionally cgrp-labelled and were in close association with an ienf .

as expected, the density of ienfs was significantly reduced at all three post-operative time-points studied when compared to the contralateral side . the extent of denervation was maximal at 11 days post-injury, and all types of ienf were affected regardless of their neurochemical phenotype. from day  <dig> to day  <dig> fibre density gradually increased , from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fibres/mm  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fibres/mm,  indicating that some reinnervation occurred over the course of the experiment.

after cci, the proportion of trka-positive fibres that were also cgrp-labelled was 40 ± 13% on day  <dig> and 52 ± 16% on day  <dig>  which was not significantly different to that contralaterally . however, at 21 days post-injury a significantly greater proportion of trka-positive fibres were also labelled for cgrp ipsilateral to mental nerve cci  compared to contralaterally . there was no difference between sides in the proportion of fibres that were trka-positive in cci animals : 11 days, ipsilateral = 54 ±  <dig> % , contralateral = 44 ± 3%, p >  <dig> , ; 14 days, ipsilateral = 37 ± 8%, contralateral = 35 ±  <dig> %, p >  <dig> ; 21 days, ipsilateral = 50 ±  <dig> %, contralateral = 47 ± 9%, p >  <dig> . this indicates that the trka-positive population of ienfs were not preferentially spared following mental nerve cci.

there was no significant difference in the number of branches on cgrp-labelled fibres in skin ipsilateral to a cci  compared to contralateral  or unoperated skin . this indicates that there was no cgrp-positive ienf sprouting within the epidermis after nerve injury.

discussion
the principal finding in the current study is that there is a temporal mismatch between the behavioural signs of neuropathic pain , skin   and phenotypic changes in cutaneous ienfs that express the high-affinity ngf receptor trka . to our knowledge this is the first time that the temporal development of neuropathic pain in relation to changes in peripheral ngf concentration and nerve fibre neurochemistry in skin have been studied. there was no significant difference in behavioural response between the injured and non-injured side in sham-operated animals indicating that behavioural changes observed were due to nerve injury and not simply due to localised inflammation caused by the surgery.

technical considerations
the present data show that unilateral cci of the rat mental nerve produced behavioural evidence of neuropathic pain, whereas the ptl model did not. just one other study has been able to demonstrate neuropathic pain after unilateral mental nerve cci  <cit> , and in that study only the chemical algogen capsaicin was an effective stimulus, as responses to cutaneous mechanical or heat stimuli were unchanged after injury . bilateral chronic constriction injury of the mental nerves with silk sutures  <cit>  produces mechanical allodynia after 2 weeks, so perhaps in the trigeminal system bilateral cci’s are required to produce the kind of changes in nociceptive behaviours seen after unilateral sciatic nerve injuries  <cit> . the extent of the denervation of the chin skin after mental nerve cci  was broadly similar to that seen in the footpad after sciatic nerve cci  <cit> , indicating that despite using two 6/ <dig> ligatures for mental nerve cci instead of four 4/ <dig> ligatures that are used for sciatic nerve cci  <cit> , the proportion of damaged axons is similar in both models. in the ptl model, we were careful not to ligate more than half of the mental nerve, as if too much of the nerve is ligated hypoalgesia or even analgesia can occur  <cit> . the current results with the ptl showed no hypoalgesia to any of the stimuli used, thus confirming that an appropriate proportion of the mental nerve was ligated. partial tight ligation of the mental nerve in other studies has also failed to produce neuropathic pain behaviours  <cit> , and this might reflect the different fibre composition of trigeminal vs. spinal nerves  <cit> .

elisa was used to measure ngf concentration because it can measure protein levels in absolute units, and has been used by others to measure ngf levels in skin  <cit> . the elisa kit uses both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to bind ngf, but the antibodies cannot distinguish between the pro- and mature forms of ngf. mature ngf is degraded quickly in vivo <cit> , and there is evidence that pro-ngf is up to  <dig> times more abundant in the nervous system than the mature form  <cit> . the acid–base treatment that we used increased ngf yield by about  <dig> fold in pilot studies, and it is thought to promote ngf dissociation from its receptors/binding proteins  <cit> . we suspect that the acid–base treatment solubilises all the ngf in the tissue, and that the elisa detects total ngf .

behavioural signs of neuropathic pain after mental nerve cci
only cold hyperalgesia was demonstrable in the mental nerve cci model, as the changes in behaviour to heat and mechanical stimuli were in the opposite direction  and therefore not indicative of neuropathic pain. in our hands, and that of others  <cit> , cci of the mental nerve seems to be a ‘mild’ model of trigeminal neuropathic pain as there is no behavioural evidence of heat or mechanical hyperalgesia. a previous study of cci of the rat infraorbital nerve  <cit>  reported that the greater the number of categories of behaviour that are observed in response to a noxious stimulus, the greater the pain severity. in the current study, cold stimuli evoked the greatest number of different behaviours  and this could indicate that cold caused the most pain in mental nerve cci. this might explain why only cold hyperalgesia was detectable in the mental nerve cci model.

in the cci model 50% withdrawal thresholds for mechanical stimuli increased over time on the contralateral side, but were stable ipsilaterally, whereas in the sham-operated group thresholds did not change. the method of mechanical testing presented a food reward with the stimulus. it is known that pain responses are suppressed in situations where rats anticipate a reward  <cit> , and because of the overnight fast, the biscuit fed to the rats during mechanical testing will probably have been a motivational reward   <cit> . a hedonic  reward is also possible due to the sweetness of the biscuit. when both pain  and reward  are presented simultaneously the rats must have made a prioritizing ‘decision’ regarding the value of the reward versus the intensity of the pain. this could explain why mechanical thresholds increased contralaterally over time – the repeated motivation of the reward caused sustained activation of descending control pathways  <cit>  that caused withdrawal thresholds to increase. if this interpretation is correct then the failure of thresholds to rise ipsilaterally could imply that descending inhibitory pathways are less effective after mental nerve cci. this hypothesis could be tested experimentally if rats could be trained without the need for a food reward for mechanical testing.

our interpretation fits with fields  <cit>  framework where pain is described in the context of decision-making under conditions of motivational conflict; he suggests that endogenous opioids suppress responses to stimuli in the presence of competing motivational states such as hunger. because the mechanical testing took place in the morning after the rats had been starved overnight and the thermal tests were conducted in the afternoon after the animals had been fed, the motivation of hunger was only present in the mechanical test, which explains why only mechanical thresholds increased contralaterally. as noted above, a hedonic motivation for the reward is also possible, and this would involve dopaminergic pathways from the ventral striatum  <cit> . the pharmacological sensitivity of dopaminergic and opioid descending pathways offers the opportunity to separate motivational from hedonic reward.

as the dominant behavioural sign of neuropathic pain after mental nerve cci was cold hyperalgesia, a role for the noxious cold-gated ion channel trpa <dig> is plausible  <cit>  . trpa <dig> expression is upregulated by ngf  <cit> , but when skin  was increased ipsilaterally on day  <dig> there was no behavioural evidence of cold hyperalgesia, and conversely when there was behavioural evidence of cold hyperalgesia  there was no significant difference in skin  between sides. on the basis of in-situ hybridization studies  <cit>  virtually all  of the dorsal root ganglion neurons that express trpa <dig> mrna also co-express mrna for the noxious heat-gated ion channel trpv <dig>  therefore nerve fibres that express trpa <dig> ought to co-express trpv <dig> and be sensitive to noxious heat, i.e. be polymodal nociceptors. as there was no behavioural evidence of heat hyperalgesia in the current study, it would seem unlikely that trpa <dig> fibres that co-expressed trpv <dig> were involved in cold hyperalgesia. other potential mechanisms include high-threshold cold receptors  <cit>  as well as cold-induced changes in membrane resistance/resurgent na+ currents  <cit> .

effects of nerve injury on skin  and skin innervation
eleven days after nerve injury ngf levels were lower bilaterally when compared to sham-operated controls. fourteen days after chronic constriction of the mental nerve  was significantly higher ipsilaterally when compared to contralateral skin, although there was no difference between cci and sham-operated animals. at this time point, the maximum difference in ngf concentration between sides was 42 pg/mg for skin samples that weighed on average 65 mg. this gives a rough estimate of an increase of 3 ng of ngf after mental nerve cci , which is  <dig> fold smaller than exogenous levels that have biological activity in nerve sprouting and pain studies  <cit> . as described previously  <cit>  and replicated here, skin  changed bilaterally after a unilateral nerve injury. as there was no change in ngf mrna levels in the skin territory of the injured nerve  <cit>  the contralateral  increase may be due to ngf diffusion secondary to reduced axonal transport post nerve injury.

approximately 40% of ienfs in the normally innervated chin skin were immunoreactive for trka, which is similar to the proportion of trka-positive cutaneous hindpaw neurons in the drg  <cit> .  <dig> - 40% of the trka-labelled fibres were also cgrp-positive, and in the epidermis these are likely to represent the terminals of cutaneous nociceptors  <cit> . the observation that not all of the trka-labelled ienfs were cgrp-positive  <cit>  is likely due to the fact that more cgrp-positive fibres are confined to the dermis, and do not branch into the epidermis  <cit> .

neuropathic pain,  and ienf neurochemistry
eleven days after cci there was behavioural evidence of cold hyperalgesia. over the next 10 days  increased threefold bilaterally but there was no evidence of neuropathic pain. thus ngf and cold hyperalgesia do not seem to be linked in the trigeminal system, although there does seem to be a causal link in spinal nerves,  <cit> . this indicates a difference in the aetiology of neuropathic pain between spinal and trigeminal nerves.

CONCLUSIONS
we had previously proposed  <cit>  that in partial nerve injuries an excess of ngf peripherally ‘over-trophed’ the remaining peripheral sensory nerve fibres, producing a ‘pro-nociceptive’ phenotype, therefore being a candidate peripheral mechanism for neuropathic pain. the current experiments do not support this hypothesis at least in the trigeminal system, as when skin  was significantly increased there was no behavioural evidence of neuropathic pain. the phenotypic changes in ienfs could be due to increased  in the skin, but they do not appear to be sufficient on their own to cause neuropathic pain.
