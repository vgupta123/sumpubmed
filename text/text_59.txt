BACKGROUND
dehydrins  are a class of hydrophilic, thermostable stress proteins with a high number of charged amino acids that belong to the group ii late embryogenesis abundant  family. genes that encode these proteins are expressed during late embryogenesis, as well as in vegetative tissues subjected to drought, low temperature and high salt conditions  <cit> . intriguingly, over-expression of dhn genes in transgenic plants has been found to enhance resistance of the transgenic lines to various adverse environments, such as cold, drought, salinity and osmotic stress  <cit> , which has raised significant interest in their putative application for crop improvement. furthermore, it has recently been shown that reduced levels of dehydrins in transgenic arabidopsis seeds leads to reduced seed longevity  <cit> , emphasizing their importance to seed survival in addition to their influence on vegetative stress tolerance.

while it is generally accepted that dhns function to protect cells from damage caused by stress-induced dehydration  <cit> , their precise mechanism remains elusive. however, it has been proposed that they may carry out their function through membrane stabilization by acting as chaperones to prevent the aggregation and/or inactivation of proteins under dehydration or high temperature conditions  <cit> .

classification of dhns is based upon structural features of the proteins, such as the presence and copy number of certain conserved motifs, such as the k-, s-, and y-segments. to date, these proteins have been divided into  <dig> subclasses, including ynskn, ynkn, skn, kn and kns  <cit> . all dhns possess at least one k-segment , which is generally located at the c-terminal end of the protein and has the ability to form an amphipathic helix-like structure that may play a role in its interaction with membranes and proteins  <cit> . the s-segment consists of a track of serines that can be modified through phosphorylation and may function in the regulation of protein conformation and ion-binding activity  <cit> . the y-segment  is located near the n-terminus and shows partial amino acid identity to the nucleotide binding site motif of chaperone proteins from various organisms  <cit> .

several other conserved regions have also been identified in a subset of dhns. for example, lysine-rich segments  contain a cluster of lysines that are generally located between the s- and k-segments  <cit>  and have been suggested to participate in the binding of dhns to dna or rna  <cit> . nuclear localization signals , which bear an rrkk motif, have been found specifically in yskn-type dhns and play a role in their localization to the nucleus  <cit> . furthermore, phosphorylation has been found to be an important factor for substrate binding of dhns  <cit> , and recently a his switch has been found to be involved in the regulation of membrane binding of the arabidopsis thaliana dhn, lti <dig>  <cit> .

at the functional level, dhn family members often exhibit sub-functionalization, with different genes displaying differential expression profiling throughout development and under stress conditions. for example, while both lti <dig>  and lti <dig>  were up-regulated in arabidopsis under low temperature conditions, only lti <dig> was up-regulated following salt treatments  <cit> . similarly, while ten barley dhns were found to be up-regulated by drought, only three were up-regulated by low temperatures  <cit> , and in oleae europaea, although expression levels of 40 kda and 42 kda dhns increased in response to various stressors , 16 kda and 18 kda dhns were mainly induced by salt stress  <cit> . these differences in expression patterns imply functional diversification within this gene family; however, at present, the relationship between subgroup classification and expression profile is unclear  <cit> .

grapevine is one of the most important fruit crops in the world and while the majority of grape varieties are directly cultivated from vitis vinifera l., this species is relatively susceptible to powdery mildew . conversely, v. yeshanensis is a wild species of grape native to the yanshan mountain in hebei province, china, that is highly tolerant to both cold and drought  <cit> , and is also resistant to e. necator <cit> . previously, two highly similar putative y2sk2-type dhn genes  were identified in v. vinifera and their expression was found to be induced by multiple types of stress, such as drought, cold and high salinity  <cit> . in this study, we aimed to identify the members of dhn gene family in v. vinifera, as well as their homologous equivalents in v. yeshanensis. in doing so, we were able to investigate the functional divergence of this gene family in these two species through comparisons of their expression profiles and putative physicochemical characteristics. furthermore, we also assessed possible relationships between specific cis-elements within dhn promoter sequences and the regulation of their expression under various conditions.

RESULTS
identification of dhn family members in v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis
a 280-bp fragment of a dhn cdna was cloned from drought-treated leaves of v. yeshanensis acc. yanshan- <dig> using differential display reverse transcription-pcr . subsequently, the full-length sequence was determined using 5’ rapid amplification of cdna ends  and was termed vydhn <dig> . the putative protein sequence of this gene was then utilized to detect dhn genes from the published v. vinifera cv. pinot noir clone pn <dig> genome sequence  <cit>  via blast analysis. four dhn genes were identified, all of which contained a k-segment. these genes were designated vvdhn <dig>  , vvdhn <dig> , vvdhn <dig> , and vvdhn <dig> .

the three remaining dhn genes were cloned from v. yeshanensis acc. yanshan- <dig> seed-specific cdna using primers derived from the v. vinifera sequences and were designated vydhn <dig> , vydhn <dig> , and vydhn <dig> . while only  <dig> amplification cycles were required to clone both vydhn <dig> and vydhn <dig>  40 cycles were required in the case of vydhn <dig>  subsequently, all four v. yeshanensis genes were amplified from genomic dna to identify intronic regions . in both species, all four dhn genes consisted of two exons separated by one intron present within the s-segment.

in terms of nucleotide similarities, virtually no sequence identity was detected between the four dhn coding sequences. however, high levels of homology were noted between matching genes belonging to the two different species, with 97%  and 99%  identity at the nucleotide level. in terms of chromosomal localization, while vvdhn <dig> and vvdhn <dig> were located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, vvdhn <dig> and vvdhn <dig> were mapped to chromosome  <dig> in opposite orientations .

characterization and comparison of deduced dhn proteins
protein sequences were deduced from the corresponding v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis dhn cdna sequences, and were composed of 130– <dig> amino acids exhibiting 97-99% identity at the amino acid level between the two species. both k- and s-segments were found to be highly conserved between members of the v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis dhn families, whereas remaining regions displayed relatively low amino acid identity between the four genes. furthermore, while nls domains were identified in both dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> proteins, a lys-rich segment was only present in dhn <dig> . based on the presence and number of k-, s- and y-motifs , the four dhns from each species were classified as either y2sk2- , sk2- , sk3- , or y3sk2-type  proteins .

mw , pi  and gravy  were predicted based on amino acid composition. pkc, ck <dig> and snrk <dig> refer to specific phosphorylation sites. expression information is based on the rt-pcr experiments described in figures  <dig> through  <dig> 

all members of the dhn family in the two grapevine species analyzed were found to be highly hydrophilic, with gravy values ranging from − <dig>  to − <dig>  and theoretical pis from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . dhn <dig> and dhn <dig>  which were ynskn-type dhns, possessed a higher pi than the skn-type dhns  in both species. in terms of acidity, our analyses indicated that dhn <dig> was the sole basic protein, while dhn <dig> was the most acidic.

many phosphorylation sites were also predicted within each of the dhn protein sequences analyzed, with dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> containing a higher number of putative protein kinase c  phosphorylation sites than casein kinase  <dig>  phosphorylation sites, and dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> containing a higher number of ck <dig> sites than pkc sites . in addition, a recently identified conserved motif  phosphorylated by an snf1-related kinase   <cit>  was identified in both dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> proteins.

while all four grapevine dhns were found to be rich in disordered regions and contained relatively few helix or strand motifs , the ynskn-type proteins  displayed the highest disorder index and least helix/strand-motifs. additionally, of the few helix motifs identified, most were located within k-segments, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study of dhn protein structure  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis dhns
to date, dhn families from both barley and arabidopsis have been thoroughly characterized at the genomic level  <cit> . therefore, to provide a further understanding of the relationships between the v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis dhns, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of these genes via comparison with those from barley and arabidopsis. overall, we found the number of dhn genes in the grapevine species  to be smaller than that in either barley  or arabidopsis . based on our phylogenetic results, the dhns could be divided into four groups, corresponding to ynskn-, skn-, kn-, and ks-type proteins , where the arabidopsis yk-type dhn  was included within the ynskn group. as expected from our classification of the grapevine dhn sequences based on the presence of various conserved segments, the grapevine dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> proteins were grouped together with the ynskn-type dhns of arabidopsis and barley, while the grapevine dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> proteins were grouped with the skn-type dhns of arabidopsis and barley. interestingly, both grapevine species lacked ks- and kn-type dhns; groups which are present in both barley and arabidopsis. 

expression profiles of dhn transcripts in various tissues and developmental stages
to elucidate the physiological functions of different members of the dhn family in v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis, the expression of dhn genes was investigated at veraison in roots, stems, leaves, seeds, and fruit peels using semi-quantitative rt-pcr . both species exhibited highly similar expression profiles for their matching dhn genes. results suggested that under normal growth conditions, dhn <dig> was mainly expressed in seeds, with very low levels present in the roots. dhn <dig> was constitutively expressed in all tissues; however, weaker levels of expression were noted in leaves and stems than in the other organs tested. dhn <dig> was undetectable under the current experimental conditions, suggesting that it was not expressed, or was at levels too low to be detected using this method, in these tissues. the dhn <dig> genes, on the other hand, were expressed specifically in seeds. these results indicate that the four dhn genes that make up the v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis dhn gene families, respectively, exhibited very distinct expression patterns in the organs tested.

intriguingly, reactions in which dhn <dig>  dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> were amplified often exhibited two bands: one that corresponded in size to a spliced transcript, and one that seemed to be closer in size to the band amplified from genomic dna . the fact that no amplification products were obtained in negative control reactions lacking reverse transcriptase confirmed that template rna was free from contaminating genomic dna. therefore, it seems that these larger transcript variants resulted from the presence of unspliced dhn transcript variants  within the total rna pool.

to gain a more precise understanding of grapevine dhn expression during the process of seed development, inflorescences and berries of v. vinifera were harvested from flowering to veraison and used for qrt-pcr expression analyses. dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> were found to be expressed in floral buds even  <dig> d before opening of the flowers , after which time their transcripts decreased during the middle stages of embryogenesis, and were strongly up-regulated once again during later stages of embryogenesis. low levels of dhn <dig> were detected in both mid- and late-stages of seed development  while dhn <dig> transcripts were only detectable during late stages of embryogenesis, with peak expression developing just prior to veraison .

response of dhn gene expression to various abiotic and biotic stresses
in an attempt to determine whether dhn <dig>  dhn <dig>  dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> exhibited stress-responsiveness, we analyzed the expression levels of all four genes in the leaves of three v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis plants, respectively, that had been subjected to various stress conditions using real-time qrt-pcr. neither dhn <dig> nor dhn <dig> from either species exhibited detectable levels of expression under any of the conditions tested here, including drought, cold, heat, or e. necator infection; therefore, only dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> will be discussed further in this section. in the case of drought conditions, although we found that dhn <dig> was induced by this treatment in both species , we noted slight differences between the two species. while dhn <dig> transcripts increased in v. yeshanensis between 1– <dig> d after the drought treatment began and reached a maximum induction of a 237-fold increase compared to baseline expression levels  <dig> d after treatment, its homologue in v. vinifera was delayed in its exhibition of a response  and reached a higher maximum induction of 366-fold compared to baseline levels. conversely, dhn <dig> did not appear to respond to drought treatment in either of the two species tested . interestingly, transcripts of both dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> also exhibited up-regulation in both grapevine species shortly after rehydration , with a maximum level of expression achieved after approximately 2 h.

following cold and heat treatment, both dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> were induced in v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis. while dhn <dig> transcripts increased gradually between 0 h and 48 h following initiation of cold stress in both species, dhn <dig> transcripts exhibited a more sudden onset of up-regulation in response to cold beginning between 6–12 h after treatment . in the case of heat stress, both dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> transcripts increased to maximum levels 24 hours following the initiation of treatment in both species, and then subsequently decreased .

to determine whether grapevine dhns were responsive to biotic stress, the levels of dhn gene expression were tested in the leaves of v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis inoculated with e. necator, which is the causative agent of grapevine powdery mildew. results suggested that only dhn <dig> was induced by e. necator, whereby transcripts increased gradually to a maximum at  <dig> d post-inoculation  and then decreased slowly after this point in both species. interestingly, v. yeshanensis exhibited a higher peak level of expression  than v. vinifera , as well as an additional sharp increase in dhn <dig> expression  <dig> dpi . in contrast, dhn <dig> did not appear to respond to e. necator inoculation in either grapevine species .

response of dhn gene expression to levels of various signaling molecules
the responses of plants to abiotic and biotic stress are generally mediated by abscisic acid  and salicylic acid /jasmonic acid , respectively. to determine whether the induction of grapevine dhns under stress conditions was related to any of these signaling molecules, dhn expression was investigated in leaves from three v. vinifera plants treated with aba, sa or meja, respectively. as was the case for studies involving abiotic and biotic stress treatment, no detectable levels of dhn <dig> or dhn <dig> expression could be detected in leaves treated with any of these chemicals. while dhn <dig> was induced by aba, sa and meja , the most considerable up-regulation  was noted 8 h following application of aba. dhn <dig> transcripts from leaves treated with meja reached a maximum induction of ~20-fold compared to baseline levels approximately 4 h following application, whereas a similar level of induction was reached 8 h following treatment with sa. in the case of dhn <dig> transcripts, expression reached a maximum 5-fold induction compared to baseline levels 4 h after application of aba. although slight modifications were also noted in dhn <dig> expression levels following sa and meja applications, respectively, they differed only slightly from changes observed in untreated samples .

comparison of cis-regulatory elements in the upstream regulatory regions of grapevine dhn genes
all four dhn promoters  were cloned from v. yeshanensis acc. yanshan- <dig>  using primers derived from the corresponding v. vinifera sequences. high levels of homology were detected between matching promoters from the two different species, with 94% , 96% , and 92%  identity at the nucleotide level. the promoter of dhn <dig>  on the other hand, only exhibited 84% identity between the two species due to a 205-bp deletion in this sequence from v. yeshanensis.

to elucidate whether the differential expression patterns of the four grapevine dhn genes correlate with transcriptional regulation via their promoters, upstream regions of each gene from v. yeshanensis and v. vinifera were scanned for putative cis-regulatory elements using the plantcare database  <cit> . nucleotide sequences including 1500-bp upstream of each start codon were obtained from the v. vinifera cv. pinot noir clone pn <dig> genome database  <cit>  , while those from v. yeshanensis were obtained directly via cloning, and cis-regulatory elements were classified into three groups according to their potential responsive functions: abiotic stress-related elements, biotic stress-related elements, and seed development-related elements. abiotic stress-related elements comprised aba-responsive elements , dehydration-responsive elements , heat shock-responsive elements , and low temperature-responsive elements . biotic stress-related elements included meja-responsive elements , salicylic acid-responsive elements , as well as stress- and defense-responsive elements . seed development-related elements comprised only endosperm-specific expression elements .

all cis-regulatory elements found in the v. yeshanensis and the v. vinifera dhn promoters, which exhibited a similar composition and distribution of putative regulatory elements between corresponding promoters, are shown in table  <dig>  there were obvious differences in the abundance and distribution of cis-regulatory elements in the four dhn promoters analyzed . the vydhn <dig> and vvdhn <dig> promoters had the most diverse collection of putative cis-regulatory elements, including several involved in stress-response, seed development, and hormone signaling . in the case of the vydhn <dig> and vvdhn <dig> promoters, hse, ltr and tca elements were lacking when compared to vydhn <dig> and vvdhn <dig>  only a small number of potential cis-elements were identified in the vydhn <dig>  vvdhn <dig>  vydhn <dig> and vvdhn <dig> promoters. in the vvdhn <dig> promoter, an abre, skn- <dig> and two tc-rich elements were scattered evenly throughout the promoter, while the abre element was absent in that of vydhn <dig>  in vvdhn <dig>  two abres, a skn- <dig> and a meja-re were concentrated in the 3’ region of the promoter, while a tca element was present in the 5’ region. a similar distribution was noted in the vydhn <dig> promoter, with an additional skn- <dig> motif present 765-bp upstream of the translational start codon.

discussion
dehydrins are believed to play a fundamental role in the response of plants to various abiotic and biotic stresses. they make up a multigene family with  <dig> members in arabidopsis  <cit> ,  <dig> members in rice  <cit> ,  <dig> members in barley  <cit> , and  <dig> members in poplar  <cit> . however, only  <dig> dhn genes were identified in the published v. vinifera genome sequence  <cit> , including two ynskn-type dhns  and two skn-type dhns . neither kn- nor ks-type dhns were found in this species, which differs from the dhn gene families from other plant species characterized to date and suggests that these types of genes may have been lost in grape species .

expansion of the dhn family has generally occurred through tandem duplication events and whole-genome duplications. for example, at1g20440/at1g <dig>  at3g50970/at3g <dig>  and at4g38140/at4g <dig> arose from tandem duplications, while at1g20450/at1g <dig>  at2g21490/at4g <dig>  and at3g50970/at5g <dig> arose from a whole-genome duplication event in arabidopsis  <cit> , which together resulted in an increase of  <dig> dhn genes. similarly, whole-genome and tandem duplication events were responsible for an increase of  <dig> and  <dig> dhn genes, respectively, in poplar  <cit> . at least  <dig> dhn genes arose from tandem duplication events in rice  <cit> , and it is possible that the two clusters of dhn genes on chromosomes 5 h and 6 h in h. vulgare, respectively  <cit> , which show a high level of sequence identity within each cluster, may have resulted from tandem duplication events.

while the genomes of poplar, rice and arabidopsis have undergone at least one recent whole-genome duplication event, the grapevine genome has not  <cit> . instead, the four grapevine dhns have likely arisen from an ancestral genome  <cit> , which is consistent with the low level of sequence similarity between the four sequences. however, dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> lay in close proximity on chromosome  <dig> in v. vinifera, which implies that one of them may have arisen through a tandem duplication event despite their low level of identity. therefore, it seems that the relatively low number of dhn genes in grapevine may simply be due to a lack of duplication events in this genus. indeed, it has been suggested that gene family expansion in grapevine has been selective, occurring mainly in those genes involved in aromatic features  <cit> .

in silico characterization of v. vinifera and v. yeshanensis dhn protein sequences suggested they were all highly hydrophilic and disordered, but with distinct differences in pi, kinase specificity and content of functional motifs. the two ynskn-type dhns  possessed a higher pi than the skn-type dhns . since positively charged dhn proteins bind negatively charged membranes with a high affinity  <cit> , it follows that the ynskn-type dhns, and especially dhn <dig>  could very well bind with the cell membrane in grapevine. it has been suggested that the binding of dhns to membranes may be modulated by phosphorylation through an alteration of net charge  <cit> . the dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> proteins from grapevine were found to contain a higher number of putative pkc sites than ck <dig> sites, whereas dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> bore a higher number of putative ck <dig> sites than pkc sites . this finding is in agreement with a previous suggestion that ynskn-type dhns are mainly phosphorylated by pkc, while skn-type dhns are mainly phosphorylated by ck <dig>  <cit> .

dhn proteins with similar physicochemical properties often also exhibit similar expression patterns. for example, while genes encoding alkaline ynskn-type dhns, such as at5g66400hvdhn1hvdhn2hvdhn3hvdhn4hvdhn7hvdhn <dig> and hvdhn <dig>  are generally induced by both embryogenesis and various types of stress  <cit> , those encoding acidic skn- and kns-type dhns, such as at1g20440at1g20450at1g76180at1g5410hvdhn <dig> and hvdhn <dig>  are expressed constitutively in vegetative tissues and are also up-regulated by various types of stress  <cit> . the expression patterns of grapevine dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> agree with those predicted by their classification, which suggests that this holds true in the species analyzed here.

even though the grapevine dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> , as well as dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> , proteins are grouped into only two classes, all four members of the grapevine dhn family exhibited very distinct patterns of expression . we found grapevine dhn <dig> to be induced by drought, cold, heat, e. necator, and to be expressed during late stages of embryogenesis, which corresponds well with previous reports  <cit> . conversely, dhn <dig> was found to be constitutively expressed in vegetative tissues and was up-regulated under cold and heat conditions, as well as during late embryogenesis . in contrast, very low levels of dhn <dig> expression were only detected during seed development with no induction observed in vegetative tissues following any of the stress or signaling molecule treatments studied here. correspondingly, although no dhn <dig> transcripts could be identified in genbank’s est database, a large number  of the remaining grapevine dhn genes were , which suggests that dhn <dig> is expressed at undetectable levels in most tissue types. likewise, dhn <dig> was also specifically expressed during late embryogenesis, but at far higher levels than dhn <dig> . these results suggest that the function of the grapevine dhn genes is likely divergent, but may also exhibit some level of overlap.

the accumulation of dhns in plants is believed to have been associated with the acquisition of desiccation tolerance in these organisms  <cit>  and expression levels of these genes in vegetative tissues has generally been found to be higher in drought-tolerant cultivars than in their susceptible counterparts  <cit> . however, this is not always the case, as differences in expression levels between tolerant and sensitive genotypes are often dependent on the type of dhn, as well as the duration of the stress. while both v. yeshanensis and v. vinifera have been found to exhibit some tolerance to drought, the former exhibits a higher tolerance than the latter and also displays resistance to cold  <cit> . in the case of induction via temperature stress, both dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> exhibited cold and heat responsiveness; however, dhn <dig> appeared to be far more responsive than dhn <dig> . interestingly, induction tended to be higher in v. vinifera than v. yeshanensis, which is contrary to the levels of temperature sensitivity in these two species.

conversely, among the four grapevine dhn genes tested, only dhn <dig> was induced by drought stress in vegetative tissues. this gene was up-regulated between 1– <dig> d after the initiation of drought conditions in v. yeshanensis, while its expression level at this time remained unchanged in v. vinifera, suggesting that the expression of dhn <dig> was quicker to respond to drought in the tolerant genotype. however, v. yeshanensis did not show a higher level of dhn <dig> expression than v. vinifera at  <dig> and  <dig> d following treatment . a similar situation has been observed in barley, where the hvdhn <dig> gene was expressed earlier in tolerant cultivars than susceptible cultivars under drought conditions, but at lower levels than the susceptible cultivars at time points that were further from the commencement of drought conditions  <cit> .

generally, dhn genes are up-regulated under drought stress and down-regulated following rehydration  <cit> . however, in this study, the grapevine dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> genes also displayed induction 2 h post-rehydration . in line with this, it has been found previously that leaf aba content increases during early phases following re-hydration  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of grapevine dhns after rehydration may correspond to a change in leaf aba content, since both genes were found to be responsive to this plant hormone .

recent studies have indicated that dhns are also responsive to pathogen infection. for example, a dhn gene can be utilized to predict blast resistance in rice  <cit> , and the arabidopsis lti <dig> and rab <dig> genes have been found to be up-regulated by inoculation with powdery mildew  <cit> . this pathogen-induced expression of dhns may provide another important function for this type of gene in disease resistance. in the current study, only dhn <dig> was found to be up-regulated in v. yeshanensis and v. vinifera following inoculation with e. necator, which is the causative agent of grapevine powdery mildew . intriguingly, the expression level of dhn <dig> was higher in the resistant v. yeshanensis than in the susceptible v. vinifera, and a second induction event was also apparent in v. yeshanensis that was lacking in v. vinifera. these results suggest that dhn <dig> may participate in powdery mildew resistance in v. yeshanensis.

dhn <dig> from v. vinifera was also induced by the signaling molecules sa and meja, which are known to be involved in defense response, providing further evidence that it could play a role in systemic acquired resistance  <cit> . it has been demonstrated previously that a number of pathogen-responsive genes were up-regulated in transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing dhn- <dig>  which implies that dhns might act as stress signaling molecules that regulate defense genes  <cit> . this may also be the case for the dhn <dig> genes from grapevine , although further experiments will be necessary to show this definitively.

the expression of stress-responsive genes depends upon the presence of cis-regulatory elements in their promoter regions  <cit> , as has been shown to be the case for barley dhn genes  <cit> . the four grapevine dhn promoters exhibited distinct differences in the composition and distribution of putative regulatory elements held within them. abres, which are one of the most common cis-elements in the dhn promoters, likely played a role in the induction of dhn <dig> by aba, mediating its expression under drought conditions. indeed, when taken together, all of the putative regulatory elements identified within both the dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> promoters could account for their up-regulation by a variety of stresses and their corresponding signal molecules . in contrast, relatively few regulatory elements were found in the dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> promoters, which corresponds with the fact that neither of these genes were found to be induced by any of the stresses or signaling molecules analyzed.

the quantity and location of regulatory elements could also have a profound effect on grapevine dhn expression. it has been found previously that a single copy of an abre is not sufficient for aba-responsive induction of transcription  <cit> . in this study, a higher number of abre elements were located in dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> promoters than in dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> promoters ; correspondingly, the two former genes were responsive to induction by aba, whereas dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> were not. furthermore, the skn- <dig> motif, which has been shown previously to confer a promoter with endosperm-specific expression  <cit> , was found in all four grapevine dhn promoters. however, these motifs were located much nearer to the translational start codon in dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> promoters than in dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> promoters, which may provide an explanation for increased up-regulation of dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> during late embryogenesis .

CONCLUSIONS
the dhn gene family was identified in a genome-wide search of the published genome sequence of v. vinifera, and the corresponding homologues were isolated from v. yeshanensis. a large expansion of the dhn family apparently did not take place in grapevine, although it has been a common occurrence in other plants. the four grapevine dhn genes shared a low sequence identity, and exhibited clear differences in physicochemical properties and expression profiles, which indicates functional diversification within the grapevine dhn family. dhn <dig> appeared to be the principal stress-responsive gene in grapevine species, and was induced not only by various abiotic stresses but also by e. necator. the small size and distinct expression profiles of the grapevine dhn gene family makes it an excellent model to elucidate functional differentiation within this gene family, which should contribute to the further understanding of these genes in plants.
