BACKGROUND
the metazoan mitochondrial genome is a circular double stranded dna molecule of about 12– <dig> kb length. due to the important role of mitochondria for cell metabolism its gene content is highly conserved and typically contains the same  <dig> genes:  <dig> protein-coding genes, two ribosomal genes and  <dig> transfer rna genes  <cit> . in addition one a+t-rich non-coding part is present which contains essential regulatory elements for transcription and replication. it is therefore referred to as the mitochondrial control region  <cit> . the organization of the mtdna is compact with very little non-coding sequences between genes, even gene overlaps by a few nucleotides are commonly found . as a result the gene order of mitochondrial genomes is relatively stable because rearrangements are likely to disrupt genes. thus changes in gene order are relatively rare, whereas trna genes more frequently change their position than larger protein-coding and rrna genes  <cit> . mollusca  <cit> , brachiopoda  <cit>  and nematoda  <cit>  represent phyla where a lot of rearrangements of mitochondrial genomes were reported, whereas in chordata only few changes in gene order were found  <cit> . among arthropods a lot of species have retained the arthropod ground pattern , while some taxa show frequent genome rearrangements, e.g. myriapoda  <cit> , hymenoptera  <cit> , acari  <cit> , and araneae  <cit> . peracarid crustaceans seem to represent another example, as two partially sequenced mitochondrial genomes  <cit>  exhibit strong differences between each other and from the arthropod ground pattern.

mitochondrial genomes offer a broad range of characters to study phylogenetic relationships of animal taxa. besides nucleotide and amino acid sequences, trna secondary structures  <cit> , deviations from the universal genetic code  <cit> , as well as changes in the mitochondrial gene order  <cit>  are successfully used as characters in phylogenetic inference. especially the changes in gene order prove as extremely reliable phylogenetic characters because the probability that homoplastic translocations occur in closely related taxa is very low. dowton et al.  <cit>  calculated a chance of 1/ <dig> for a single gene translocation event occuring independently in two mitochondrial genomes . however, this probability could be underestimated according to yet unidentified constraints on modes of gene rearrangements and should be handled with care. with about  <dig>  known species peracarids comprise approximately one third of all crustacean species so far described. within crustacea the isopods form the largest subtaxon . isopods show an amazing ecological diversity and morphological flexibility. they are common around the globe, their habitats range from deep sea plains over freshwater wells to terrestrial, even arid deserts. although to date  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes from crustaceans are available – thereof  <dig> from malacostracan species – a complete mitochondrial sequence of a peracarid species is still missing. recent sequencing efforts with the amphipod parhyale hawaiiensis  <cit>  and the isopod idotea baltica  <cit>  produced almost complete genome records, lacking only the control region and some of the trna genes. here we present the first complete sequence of a peracarid mitochondrial genome. ligia oceanica  is a terrestrial species living on rocky seashore habitats. it is found from norway to iceland in the north, around the british islands and the north sea coasts south to northern spain and portugal. we discuss changes in gene order compared to other crustacean taxa and give an overview about genome rearrangements in crustacea. in addition we compare nucleotide composition of isopod mitochondrial genes and trna secondary structure, and describe in detail uncommon features of the mitochondrial control region from ligia oceanica.

RESULTS
genome organization
the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of l. oceanica has an overall length of  <dig>  bp . successfully accomplished pcrs have proven a circular organization of the molecule . although this is the general state of metazoan mitochondrial dna, it is mentioned here, because there is evidence for a linear organization in a related species, armadillidum vulgare   <cit> . all  <dig> protein coding subunits which are usually found in metazoan mitochondrial genomes are present, as well the two rrna subunits . in contrast only  <dig> trna genes instead of the typical number of  <dig> were identified . in addition one major non-coding sequence was detected, which presumably contains the origin of replication and regulatory elements for transcription . there are small gene overlaps at  <dig> gene borders. the largest has a length of  <dig> nucleotides . some small non-coding sequences exist which occur quite often in arthropod mitochondrial genomes. the largest extends up to  <dig> nucleotides and is located between trnt and nad <dig> 

protein-coding genes
the a+t content of the protein coding genes of the l. oceanica mitochondrial genome is with  <dig> %  at the lower end observed for malacostracan species. the values range from a  <dig> % minimum given by cherax destructor  <cit>  to a  <dig> % maximum by penaeus monodon  <cit> . whereas the majority of the  <dig> protein coding genes show usual start codons for mtdna, two genes begin with exceptional codons . the gene atp <dig> probably starts with codon gtg. although there is an ata codon nine bp downstream from this start codon, alignments with atp <dig> amino acid sequences from other arthropods suggest the presence of more amino acids in the starting region. gtg is probably also in use as start codon in mitochondrial genes from idotea baltica   <cit> . the second gene with an apparently exceptional codon is cox <dig>  which starts with acg. although this seems to be unusual in metazoan mitochondrial genomes, almost all other malacostracan crustaceans studied so far have this start codon for cox <dig>  the only known exception concerns the crab portunus trituberculatus  <cit> . two of the protein coding genes show truncated stop codons. the gene for nad <dig> terminates with ta whereas cox <dig> bears a single thymine at its end. this is a well known phenomenon in the mitochondrial genome and is frequently reported for several species. the stop codons are very likely completed by post-transcriptional polyadenylation, so that each transcript finally obtains a functional uaa terminal codon  <cit> .

in most arthropods there is a strand specific bias in nucleotide frequencies  <cit> . in detail the strand contains more cytosine and adenine, while the strand consequently is more rich in guanine and thymine. some taxa show a reversal in that strand bias, among them the isopod idotea baltica  <cit> . strand bias is best reflected in gc skew  <cit>  of mitochondrial genes . in ligia oceanica, as well as in idotea baltica, gc skew is positive in strand encoded genes, while it is negative in strand encoded genes. this is in contrast to most other malacostracan crustaceans and is probably due to an inversion of the mitochondrial control region, or at least the replication origin  <cit> . further evidence comes from sequence analysis of the control region .

the effective number of codons  is a statistic describing how far codon usage in protein-coding genes departs from the equal usage of all synonymous codons  <cit> . its range lies between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the latter departs from the usual value of  <dig> for nuclear genes as in invertebrate mitochondrial genomes  <dig> codons are in use . the enc of all published crustacean mitochondrial genomes was determined for all genes , except nad4l and atp <dig>  because these genes are too short  to get proper results. a positive correlation with g+c content in third codon positions was revealed . there is no obvious difference seen between malacostracan and other crustaceans. genes from the two isopod species  are of higher g+c content and therefore show a higher than average number of effective codons. for numbers of effective codons for individual species and genes, as well as genbank accession numbers see additional file  <dig> 

transfer rnas
we identified  <dig> out of normally found  <dig> transfer-rna genes in the mitochondrial genome of ligia oceanica. despite extensive efforts to find secondary structures in non-coding regions the gene trnr was not found in the mitochondrial genomes sequence. by all means trna-arg is essential for maintaining translation of mitochondrial gene products, so it has to be either imported into the mitochondrion, or its gene exists in the mitochondrial genome, but is subject to extensive rna editing and therefore not identifiable by now.

transfer-rna genes are spread over the entire genome and are located on both strands .  <dig> of them were identified using trnascan-se  <dig>   <cit> . the other seven trna genes  were found by eye inspection of otherwise non-coding regions. some of the putative secondary structures derive from the usual cloverleaf pattern : trna-cys and trna-ser lack the dhu-arm. the loss of this arm in trna-ser was also observed in many other arthropod species, among malacostracan crustaceans pseudocarcinas gigas and macrobrachium rosenbergi  <cit> , euphausia superba  <cit> , cherax destructor  <cit> , penaeus monodon  <cit> , and portunus trituberculatus  <cit> . in contrast to that, the derived structure of trna-cys seems to be unique among malacostracan species studied so far. transfer-rna-val and trna-ile miss the tΨc-arm. again these features are not seen in other malacostracan crustaceans.

a misplaced adenine was recorded in the anticodon loop of trna-val. its existence has been proven by repeated sequencing of different pcr-products. to assure the functionality of this gene a correctional rna editing must be presumed in which a single nucleotide is removed. similar post-transcriptional events with insertion and deletion of single nucleotides are known from the mitochondrial mrnas of trypanosomes  <cit> , trna editing was demonstrated in the centipede lithobius forficatus  <cit> . in addition several mismatches are found in trna stems, most of them in the acceptor stem . such mismatches were also reported from other animal mitochondrial trnas and are probably further subjects to rna editing  <cit> .

control region and repetitive sequences
there is one major non-coding region of  <dig> bp length located between trni and trne. it is assumed to be the mitochondrial control region. at its boundary to trni it contains two sections with repetitive sequences . the first consists of a series of four completely matching sequences of  <dig> bp each and extends into trni. the second section is formed by a consecutive triplicate  <dig> bp segment. no similarities of these sequences to any other mitochondrial gene could be identified. only a few other mitochondrial genomes were shown to contain any repeat region: rabbit mitochondrial genomes show repeated  <dig> bp motifs in their mitochondrial control region, varying in copy number between different individuals or tissues  <cit> ; the highly aberrant mitochondrial genome of the brachiopod lingula anatina posesses ten different unassigned repeated elements ranging in size between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp and in copy number between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . also some insects show tandem repetitions in mitochondrial dna  <cit> .

contrary to expectations the a+t content in the control region  is lower than in other parts of the genome . in contrast most other arthropods have an a+t-rich control region. while the repeat region is a+t-rich , a  <dig> bp region near the 3'-end of the control region has an a+t content of only  <dig> % . that region is putatively folded into a hairpin-like structure with a stem consisting of  <dig> paired nucleotides  and a loop consisting of  <dig> nucleotides . this hairpin-like structure highly resembles stem-loop structures known from insect mitochondrial control regions which have stems ranging between 15– <dig> bp and loops of about 9– <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . similar stem-loop structures were found in other crustacean species, like the mantis shrimp squilla mantis and the spiny lobster panulirus japonicus . the flanking sequences around the stem region show conserved motifs: 5'-flanking sequences show a tata element, while 3'-flanking sequence contains a gact in ligia and squilla, while the gaaat motif typical for insects is found in panulirus. it is assumed that these structures are of functional importance in conjunction with the origin of replication  <cit> . in ligia the flanking motifs are found in opposite direction and strand compared to that of squilla and panulirus. this fact gives direct evidence for an inversion of the control region in isopods .

an overview about gene translocations in crustacea
crustacean systematics is far from being settled. while malacostraca seems to be a well defined clade, the interrelationships between crustacean subtaxa is under debate and even monophyly of crustacea is doubtful, with respect to the position of hexapoda, which are probably the next relatives to a crustacean subtaxon   <cit> . mitochondrial genome rearrangements may serve as phylogenetic markers which support sistergroup relationships among crustacea. from  <dig> species of crustcea complete or almost complete mitochondrial genome sequences are recorded in genbank. gene order is not conserved among these taxa: only  <dig> species show no changes compared to the pancrustacean ground pattern . transfer-rna genes are more often translocated than other genes, probably because of their small size.

crustacea and hexapoda  share the same ground pattern in mitochondrial gene order  <cit> . it differs from the euarthropod ground pattern  <cit>  by the position of one trna gene: trnl <dig> is located between cox <dig> and cox <dig>  whereas in chelicerata, myriapoda and onychophora trnl <dig> is located between nad <dig> and rrnl, adjacent to trnl <dig>  <cit> . among other data, mitochondrial gene translocations have shown that the enigmatic remipedia and pentastomida definitely belong to pancrustacea, as they show the above mentioned translocation of trnl <dig>  <cit> . only three crustacean species do not show this character: the cephalocarid hutchinsoniella macrantha  <cit> , where trnl <dig> probably is secondarily translocated to another position , and the two copepod species tigriopus japonicus  <cit>  and lepeophtheirus salmonis  <cit> , which underwent a complete shuffling of the mitochondrial genome.

three species  share a translocation of trnk to a position between trnr and trnn  <cit> . among these, the tongue worm armillifer armillatus and the fish louse argulus americanus share one further translocation , together with mtdna sequence analysis supporting a close relationship between pentastomida and branchiura  <cit> . that was already discussed according to sperm morphology  <cit>  and 18s molecular sequence data  <cit> . trnk is also translocated in all other taxa refered to as members of "maxillopoda", a systematic unit only weakly based on morphological characters. however, ostracoda, copepoda and cirripedia each show different positions for trnk compared to the above mentioned taxa, so there is no good reason to take this as a homology. because of contrary results from morphological and sequence based analyses  <cit>  it is also questionable to unite the cephalocarida with branchiura and pentastomida to one clade, solely based on the common translocation of trnk .

the three species of cirripedia  <cit> ,  share several translocations of trna genes . another series of events is difficult to reconstruct: trnc and trny are translocated in all three species to a position between trns <dig> and nad <dig>  but in different order and on different strands . in addition one species shows a triplication of trnc . two further differences are reported in megabalanus volcano: an inversion of a block of five genes  and the probable translocation of trnk and trnq to a position between trny and trnc . an alternative explanation is that trnk/trnq were primarily translocated to that position seen in megabalanus and secondarily translocated to the position seen in pollicipes and tetraclita. with data from these three species alone, it is not possible to reconstruct a ground pattern of mitochondrial gene order of cirripedia with respect to the position of trnk, trnq, trny and trnc.

a lot of further translocation events are recorded only in single species, making them useless in phylogenetic analysis of the actual data set. large genome rearrangements involving also protein-coding genes are seen in the branchiuran argulus americanus  <cit> , and in the ostracod vargula hilgendorfi  <cit> , both accompanied by a duplication of the control region. but the highest degree of genome rearrangement was found in the two copepod species  <cit> , where a complete reshuffling of the mitochondrial genomes has led to a gene order with almost no similarities between the two species and to other crustaceans. partial genomes from two other copepod species revealed even more rearrangements  <cit> . in contrast three species of branchiopoda have retained the pancrustacean ground pattern. the fourth species, artemia franciscana shows two trna gene translocations   <cit> .

among malacostraca  <dig> from  <dig> species have retained the pancrustacean ground pattern: six mantis shrimps  and four members of decapoda . among decapoda independent translocation events changed gene order in pagurus longicarpus  <cit> , cherax destructor  <cit> , and brachyura. the four species of brachyura share a translocation of trnh, the freshwater crabs geothelphusa dehaani  <cit>  and eriocheir japonica  <cit>  show further translocations. in the euphausiacea euphausia superba a swap between trnl <dig> and trnl <dig> seems to have happened, probably preceded by a gene duplication  <cit> .

besides the two isopod species , only one other peracarid mitochondrial sequence, from the amphipod parhyale hawaiiensis, was published before  <cit> . from six gene translocations that must be assumed to get the gene order of parhyale hawaiiensis, none is shared with the mitochondrial genomes of isopods . only trni is translocated in both taxa, but as its new position is different in parhyale hawaiiensis and ligia oceanica , there is no reason to presume that a translocation had already happened in their common ancestor. instead we assume an independent translocation of this gene in isopods and amphipods. this implies, that the ground pattern of gene order in peracarida must be identical to that of pancrustacea.

gene translocations in isopods
a comparison of the complete mitochondrial genome of l. oceanica with the ancestral state of pancrustacea  <cit>  demonstrates several changes in gene order . all in all  <dig> genes  and the control region are found in other relative positions than reported in other malacostracan crustaceans. by reason of parsimony we assume that these positional changes were due to nine gene translocations  and a translocation of the major non-coding region . the genes nad <dig> and trnf, as well as nad <dig> and trnl <dig> retained their adjacent positions, so that they probably were translocated as a block. the other genes were most likely repositioned by single translocation events. five translocations led also to inversion of genes to the complementary strand: cob, trnt and trnw changed from the strand to the strand, whereas rrns and the block of nad <dig> and trnf were inverted from strand to strand.

from the  <dig> genes being translocated in ligia oceanica, seven are also found in the same new positions in the mitochondrial genome of idotea baltica   <cit> . in addition the mitochondrial control region, trnw, trni and trns <dig> are not found in their original position in idotea baltica, but will probably be found in the region not sequenced yet – between rrns and cob, similar to ligia oceanica. of all genes translocated in ligia oceanica only trnv is found in its original position in idotea baltica. so of nine gene translocation events supposed for ligia oceanica, eight must already have happended in the common ancestor of both species . the derived gene order is probably the ground pattern for an isopod subtaxon comprised of oniscidea and valvifera . translocation of trnv probably happened after the split of the oniscidean and valviferan lineages . in contrast, translocation of trnn probably happened in the lineage leading to idotea baltica . it is located in original position in ligia oceanica, but missing in that position in idotea baltica. we do not know about the fate of trnr in ligia oceanica, but in idotea baltica it was also subject to a translocation .

it is noticeable that in ligia oceanica all translocated genes found their new position in a segment comprising about one third of the complete genome . this area bears a cluster of trna genes in the ancestral gene order of arthropods. it seems to be a "hot spot" of genome rearrangements in arthropods  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a peracarid arthropod, the isopod ligia oceanica, shows the usual compact and circular organization known from other metazoa. gene order is not conserved among peracarids and even not among isopods. in ligia oceanica  <dig> genes plus the control region have changed their relative positions in comparison to the pancrustacean ground pattern, implying to be the result of nine gene translocation events. no gene translocation is shared with the amphipod parhyale hawaiiensis, whereas eight gene translocations were probably already present in the common ancestor of ligia oceanica and another isopod, idotea baltica. both isopod mitochondrial genomes differ by the position of three trna genes  and share an inverted strand bias of nucleotide frequencies compared to other malacostracan crustaceans. reason for this is probably an inversion of the replication origin. this is confirmed by the fact that the typical hairpin-like secondary structure commonly found in mitochondrial control regions is found in opposite orientation compared to other crustacean species.

a broad survey of mitochondrial gene rearrangements in crustacea reveals a great variation of gene order. characters derived from gene order  do not solve overall phylogenetic relationships between major crustacean subtaxa. however, they will probably be helpful in analyses of internal phylogeny of some of these subtaxa , when more data will be provided.
