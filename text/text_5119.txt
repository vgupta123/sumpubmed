BACKGROUND
in higher plants, the vast majority of structures and organs, such as leaves, stems, roots, and flowers, are formed postembryonically from groups of undifferentiated cells, called meristems. in many species of plants, certain meristems are maintained throughout life. the activities of the root apical meristem  and the shoot apical meristem  determine root and shoot structure and function, respectively. stem cells are confined to the centers of shoot and root apices, and their proliferation is maintained by signals that cells receive from the local environment  <cit> . they undergo precisely controlled division, which must be rapid enough to replenish cells lost to differentiation, but restricted enough to prevent overproliferation of undifferentiated cells. adjacent to the stem cells, several cells in the sam and ram form the organizing center  and quiescent center , respectively. these cells coordinate with neighboring cells to establish the balance between proliferation and differentiation in the meristem niche  <cit> .

several meristematic genes form feedback networks that control this dynamic balance. in arabidopsis, wus encodes a transcription factor expressed in the oc, and its expression promotes the identity of distal meristem cells as stem cells, which themselves are characterized in part by clv <dig> expression  <cit> . clv <dig> encodes a peptide hormone expressed in the central apical surface of shoot and floral meristems and is necessary for controlling the size of the central zone  in sams  <cit> . wus and clv <dig> form a feedback regulation loop: clv <dig> acts as mobile intercellular signal to negatively regulate wus transcription in the oc via the receptor proteins clv1/clv2/coryne , while wus positively regulates clv <dig> expression  <cit> . similar to the shoot meristem, the root qc maintains the stem state of the surrounding cells and prevents these cells from differentiating  <cit> . wox <dig> is the functional homolog of wus expressed in the qc  <cit> , and cle <dig> is a clv3-related peptide expressed in differentiated stele and columella cells  <cit> . like the clv3-wus network in the shoot, cle <dig> and wox <dig> form a self-regulating network that controls the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells in the root  <cit> .

besides these vital meristematic regulatory genes, the organization and maintenance of cells in meristems are also modulated by several cell cycle control genes. it is still unclear whether the cell cycle machinery acts largely independently in regulating meristem organization, or acts by receiving the signals from meristematic pattern genes via unknown mechanisms. the cell division cycle protein cdc <dig>  cyclin d <dig> , hbt/cdc27b, and the cyclin-dependent kinases a; <dig> , cdkb2; <dig> and cdkb2; <dig> have been reported to be necessary for sam and/or ram development  <cit> . these proteins are among numerous cell cycle regulators, including other cyclins, cdks, cdk inhibitors and cdcs, that precisely control the mitotic cell cycle during the four cell phases and several checkpoints to accomplish dna replication and subsequent division. once the need for the cell cycle regulators ends, they are degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. anaphase-promoting complex , which functions as an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that marks target cell cycle proteins for degradation by the  <dig> s proteasome, plays an important role in the phase transition of the cell cycle  <cit> .

some genes that are not considered to be part of the cell cycle regulator class of proteins also contribute to the development of meristems and are involved with the normal sequence of the cell cycle. among these are the mgoun  <dig>  and fasciata  <dig>  genes, which play critical roles in the fundamental organization and/or functioning of both the sam and ram  <cit> . fas <dig> and mgo <dig> are characterized by fasciated stems and short roots  <cit> . fas <dig> is one subunit of arabidopsis chromatin assembly factor- <dig> , which shows a conserved activity for chromatin assembly at the dna replication fork in s phase. loss of function of fas <dig> alters the epigenetic marks at promoters of genes involved in activation of the g <dig> damage checkpoint, leading to inhibition of mitosis progression  <cit> . mgo <dig> is homologous to type ib topoisomerase, which has been reported to stabilize the epigenetic state of developmentally regulated genes and to affect gene expression in conjunction with the chromatin remodeling pathway in arabidopsis <cit> . an unknown mechanism is likely to be present that integrates the meristematic regulating network with the cell cycle machinery to translate sam identity and maintenance into cellular behavior. the exact nature of this linkage and the mediator or mediators between these two networks is an important research question.

in this article, we report the isolation of a novel sam defective mutant, xcm <dig>  which displays clear signs of bifurcation and premature termination under our conditions. positional cloning revealed that the xcm <dig> gene encodes an activator of apc/c, namely ccs52a <dig>  rt-pcr, promoter analysis and in situ hybridization assays show that the ccs52a <dig> gene is broadly expressed in all organs tested, but has higher expression specifically in the shoot apices and root tips. our genetic studies indicate that the ccs52a <dig> gene functions together with wus and clv <dig> in stem cell regulation, and also contributes to this regulation together with the chromatin remodeling pathway. monitoring of cycb1: <dig> expression revealed that cell cycle progression is disturbed in xcm <dig>  we propose that the ccs52a <dig> gene is a mediator that regulates meristem organization, functions together with meristematic genes and cross-functions with chromatin regulators in cell cycle progression during sam development.

RESULTS
mutations in the xcm <dig> gene disrupt sam development and maintenance
while screening for phenotypic mutants from myb-family t-dna insertion lines, we identified a shoot apex-defective mutant segregating in salk_ <dig> from the salk t-dna collection  <cit> . this mutant was named xcm <dig>  xcm <dig> mutants demonstrate premature termination  and bifurcations of shoot apices . this premature termination is evident in the primary shoot and lateral inflorescences of xcm <dig>  which have an average of  <dig>   flowers on main stems and  <dig>   flowers on lateral inflorescences, compared with an average of  <dig>  flowers on wt. in most cases, xcm <dig> plants prematurely terminated with fewer flower buds and a senesced sam . but in some groups of shoot apices, the terminus had a flower stalk with a single flower or two fused flowers without an apparent sam , suggesting that the sam is completely consumed by flower production at the terminus. those single or several-fused flowers in the terminus always exhibited fewer flower organs  and showed curved or fasciated stigmas . in some extreme cases, the floral sam did not generate any flowers but only terminated as a cluster of tiny buds, which were arrested during early stages of flower development . bifurcations were frequently observed in reproductive shoot apices , flowers  and stems . thus while only  <dig> % of reproductive shoot apices of ccs52a2- <dig>  was observed to bifurcate, we can infer that more bifurcations occurred in the rosette during early vegetative development, since some xcm <dig> mutants had more than one leaf initiation center. subsequent results from local gene expression supported this .

besides the defective shoots, xcm <dig> was reduced in height , stem diameter , silique length  and leaf size . the number of seeds per silique in xcm <dig> was reduced, but the seed size was about 1/ <dig> larger in both length  and in width .

cell organization of sam is disordered in xcm9
to determine whether the defects of shoot apices in mutants were preceded by the abnormal development of the sam, we visualized the cellular morphology of mutant meristems by semi-thin section. cell organization was disrupted in the l <dig> and l <dig> layers of the sam in 8-day-old xcm <dig> plants compared with the highly organized cells in wt . the width of sams in mature embryos and 8-day-old seedlings of xcm <dig> were broadened to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm, compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the wt, respectively . in addition, counting of cell numbers in mutant sam semi-thin sections showed that there was no significant difference  with the wt. examination of the average cell areas in both the l <dig> layer and throughout the sam both indicated that the enlargement of the sam was mainly due to an increase of the meristem cell areas in the xcm <dig> mutant in comparison with wt . we also compared the floral sams between xcm <dig> and wt. the flowering-stage sams from primary stems of xcm <dig> were smaller  than that of wt , which is in contrast to sams in embryos and seedlings. scanning electron microscopy  was used to investigate the overall structure of flowering-stage sams. the results indicate that the xcm <dig> sam in the primary floral shoot was smaller than wt, which is consistent with results from semi-thin sections; this may be due to premature termination of the floral shoot in xcm <dig>  bifurcated sams were usually observed in lateral floral shoots, and each of the splitting sams was surrounded by a ring of floral primordia . all of the above suggests the size and cell organization of the sam were both affected in conjunction with the phenotype of defective shoots in xcm <dig> 

a  <dig> kb deletion of at4g <dig> caused the shoot apex defect
to test if the mutant phenotype of xcm <dig> gene cosegregated with the kanamycin resistance harbored in the t-dna insert, we grew the mutant seeds on ms medium with kanamycin and found that they are kanamycin-sensitive, indicating that the kanamycin resistance gene may be silenced or lost. the t-dna website   <cit>  indicates that the t-dna was inserted in the 3rd exon of the at1g <dig> gene, which encodes a myb-like hth transcriptional regulator family protein. primers were designed from the flanking sequences of the t-dna insertion to confirm its existence. expected amplification was obtained, indicating that the kanamycin resistance gene was silenced in the mutant. segregation analysis indicated that the t-dna insertion did not cosegregate with the mutant phenotype, suggesting that the mutant phenotype is not caused by the t-dna insertion.

to clone the gene that was disrupted in the xcm <dig> mutant, the xcm <dig> mutant was crossed to ecotype landsberg erecta  for mapping. all f <dig> plants displayed a wt phenotype, whereas the f <dig> progeny segregated for xcm <dig> and wt seedlings, indicating that the xcm <dig> mutation is recessive in a single nuclear gene 2 =  <dig> ). bulked segregant analysis mapped the xcm <dig> locus to the interval between ciw <dig> and ciw <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  further fine mapping located the xcm <dig> locus between the two short sequence length polymorphism  markers on bacterial artificial chromosomes  f7l <dig> and t4c <dig>  additional markers were used to fine-map the locus between sslp markers on bac clones t26m <dig> and f16j <dig> . sequencing of the genomic dna amplified from this 47kb region revealed a  <dig> kb deletion that starts from the 5th exon of at4g <dig> and extends to the intergenic region between at4g <dig> and at4g <dig> in the xcm <dig> mutant.

to verify whether the deletion in at4g <dig> caused the shoot apex defects in xcm <dig>  we next performed a complementation test by inserting a  <dig> kb genomic dna fragment containing the  <dig> kb upstream sequence, the full-length coding region and  <dig> kb downstream sequences of at4g <dig>  into heterozygous plants of xcm <dig> , because homozygous xcm <dig> plants exhibit a strong phenotype and do not produce enough flowers for transformation. we found that all transgenic plants obtained in a homozygous xcm <dig> background were phenotypically indistinguishable from wt plants, confirming that the apex defect phenotypes observed in xcm <dig> were caused by the deletion of either at4g <dig> or at4g <dig>  in addition, two salk lines, salk_ <dig> and salk_073708c were identified with t-dna insertions in exon  <dig> and  <dig> of at4g <dig>  respectively . these two mutants showed similar phenotypes to xcm <dig>  and were designated as xcm9- <dig> and xcm9- <dig>  respectively. these results together confirmed that the mutant phenotypes were caused by the mutation of at4g <dig> 

the at4g <dig> gene consists of nine exons and eight introns  and encodes a putative cdh1/ccs52a2/fzr <dig> protein , which contains wd <dig> repeats and is a component of apc/c, acting a co-activator and substrate recognizer  <cit> . therefore, the xcm <dig> mutant was renamed ccs52a2- <dig>  xcm9- <dig> corresponds to ccs52a2- <dig>  and xcm9- <dig> was renamed ccs52a2- <dig> <cit> . in arabidopsis, ccs52a <dig> was reported as stabilizing root meristem maintenance by acting in the distal region of the root and regulating the mitotic state of the qc  <cit> . additionally, ccs52a <dig>  under the regulation of the transcription factor ef1/del, promotes endoreduplication in cells of mature leaves  <cit> . in arabidopsis, three cdh1/fzr homologs, atccs52a <dig>  atccs52a <dig> and atccs52b, have been previously identified  <cit> . all of the ccs <dig>  proteins show a similar structure, with conserved c-box, csm , the ir motifs  and the cbm motif   <cit> . importantly, ccs52a2- <dig> lost the conserved potential cdk phosphorylation sites, ir and cbm motifs of ccs52a <dig>  suggesting that this allele is a possible null mutant.

ccs52a <dig> mrna is broadly expressed
rt-pcr analysis indicated that ccs52a <dig> had a broad expression profile including roots, rosette leaves, stem, cauline leaves, inflorescences and siliques . the expression of ccs52a <dig> was also examined in 8-day-old plants by a histochemical gus assays, using transgenic plants expressing the ccs52a2::gus fusion protein under the control of the ccs52a <dig> native promoter. strong expression was observed in shoot apices and root tips . to determine the expression region of ccs52a <dig> mrna, in situ hybridization was carried out. the results were consistent with that of the gus assay, presenting strong signals in the entire sam , lateral leaf primordia in 8-day-old seedlings , flower primordia , and pollen  of different stages in 28-day-old plants.

the expression patterns of wus and clv <dig> were altered in the ccs52a2- <dig> mutant
the disordered organization of sam in ccs52a2- <dig> and high expression of ccs52a <dig> in the shoot apex prompted us to investigate whether the expression patterns of two essential meristematic genes, wus and clv <dig>  are affected in the mutant. qrt-pcr results using dissected sam from 10-day-old seedlings indicated that wus was expressed at a higher level in ccs52a2- <dig>  while clv <dig> maintained slightly higher mrna expression levels in ccs52a2- <dig> mutants when compared with wt .

to further examine the expression patterns of these meristematic genes in the sam, mrna in situ hybridization assay of wus and clv <dig> genes were carried out. the expression of wus in wt is restricted in a small region composed of a few cells in the center of the sam   <cit> . however, in the sam of 8-day-old ccs52a2- <dig> seedlings, wus expressed in one enlarged domain at higher levels , or in two distinct nearby domains , suggesting that enlarged or multiple oc zones are formed, which is consistent with the broadening sams and bifurcations of the stem. in contrast to seedlings, the reproductive sams of the mutant had either no detectable or decreased expression of wus  in comparison with wt , which suggests that the size reduction and premature termination of the floral shoot meristems in ccs52a2- <dig> mutants may be caused by a loss of wus activity.

in wt, clv <dig> mrna accumulates in a small zone of cells in the first three layers at the meristem apex   <cit> . compared with wt, the sams of 8-day-old ccs52a2- <dig> seedlings that were examined exhibited increased clv <dig> expression . however, most of the 28-day-old ccs52a2- <dig> plants  had a slightly wider but shallower expression of clv <dig> in the reproductive sam sections compared to limited expression in the central surface of wt sam , while some didn’t show a significant difference with wt.

to verify the results from in situ hybridization, we monitored the expression of wus and clv <dig> using gus reporters  in wt and ccs52a2- <dig>  the pwus::gus assay presented a similar expression pattern as rna in situs: enlarged and sometimes dual expression domains in the ccs52a2- <dig> background . in addition, the pclv3::gus location in ccs52a2- <dig> sam exhibited two nearby domains of clv <dig> expression in  <dig> of  <dig> 8-day–old seedlings examined , which indicated that two separate wus-clv <dig> supporting systems of meristem organization had been established as early as the 8-day-old stage. it was also discovered that clv <dig> showed broad expression in some first layer cells that flank the major expression zone in  <dig> of  <dig> sams of ccs52a2- <dig> seedlings , while the remaining  <dig> of  <dig> ccs52a2- <dig> sams exhibited a single clv <dig> expression region. additionally, the floral sams in main stems of ccs52a2- <dig> always displayed decreased clv <dig> expression , but in some lateral branches multiple clv <dig> expression regions were observed . these were consistent with the observations of multiple sams in lateral branches  and smaller sams in main stems .

ccs52a2- <dig> is synergistic to wus and clv mutants
to test if genetic interactions exist between ccs52a <dig> and the wus, clv <dig> and clv <dig> genes, we created the double mutants ccs52a2- <dig> wus- <dig>  ccs52a2- <dig> clv1- <dig>  ccs52a2- <dig> clv1- <dig> and ccs52a2- <dig> clv3- <dig> by crossing ccs52a2- <dig> with wus- <dig>  clv1- <dig>  clv1- <dig> and clv3- <dig>  respectively. clv1- <dig> and clv3- <dig> produce enlarged shoot and floral meristems relative to wt and are considered the strongest alleles of clv <dig> and clv <dig> mutants   <cit> . double mutants with clv3- <dig> had a novel phenotype: ccs52a2- <dig> clv3- <dig> plants  consistently had many more rosette leaves with larger shoot meristems  and exhibited a delayed transition from vegetative phase to reproductive phase compared to wt and single mutants. additionally, ccs52a2- <dig> clv3- <dig> double mutants displayed severe fasciation in reproductive sams and stems . more severe bifurcations  were present in ccs52a2- <dig> clv3- <dig> double mutants compared to ccs52a2- <dig> single mutants, which generally produced  <dig> or  <dig> shoot apices from bifurcations. we were unable to count the exact number of shoot apices resulting from such extreme bifurcations because of the twisted stems.

clv <dig> is the direct downstream target of clv <dig> in the clv3-wus pathway  <cit> , so ccs52a2- <dig> clv <dig> was expected to have similar phenotype to ccs52a2- <dig> clv <dig>  observations of ccs52a2- <dig> clv1- <dig> and ccs52a2- <dig> clv1- <dig> double mutants showed similar fasciation in shoot apices as in the ccs52a2- <dig> clv3- <dig> double mutants. the ccs52a2- <dig> clv1- <dig>  displayed bifurcation at a very high frequency, over 50% under our conditions, compared to  <dig> % for ccs52a2- <dig> . all ccs52a2- <dig> clv1- <dig> double mutants were classified into three types according to the width of fasciated stems . notably, type i had the widest major stem, followed by type ii and then the type iii. the type i and type ii double mutants had no lateral branches originating from the rosette leaves, but type iii did. most of the ccs52a2- <dig> clv1- <dig> double mutants prematurely terminated in the formation of several flowers in lateral branches, which signifies that clv1- <dig> can’t rescue premature termination in ccs52a2- <dig> by enlarging sam size in the absence of clv function. furthermore, flowers in both ccs52a2- <dig> clv3- <dig> and ccs52a2- <dig> clv1-4/clv1- <dig> double mutants appeared to be typical of clv flowers, with increased floral organ number, including 4– <dig> carpels and  <dig> petals. the severe sam bifurcations and fasciation in ccs52a2- <dig> clv3- <dig> and ccs52a2- <dig> clv1- <dig> double mutants revealed a synergistic interaction between ccs52a <dig> and the clv pathway, with ccs52a <dig> being involved in independent pathways but in the same general process of sam development and maintenance as clv <dig> and clv <dig> 

wus is another important gene in the organization and identity of sam cells, as wus creates a feedback regulation loop with clv <dig> and clv <dig> <cit> . the primary shoot meristem of wus- <dig> seedlings fails to maintain itself, and cells of the meristem differentiate, halting further shoot growth until adventitious meristems form to initiate further leaves and shoots  <cit> . to test the interaction of wus with ccs52a <dig>  we constructed the ccs52a2- <dig> wus- <dig> double mutant. 34% of 12-day-old progeny of ccs52a2-3/+ wus-1/+ showed a defective sam that resembled the wus- <dig> single mutant, which was higher than the 24% of wus-1/+ self progeny . thus ccs52a2- <dig> wus- <dig> double mutant seedlings  appeared phenotypically identical to wus- <dig> single mutants, displaying serious defects in sam organization, including the inability to establish normal shoot meristems followed by the development of secondary adventitious-like meristems, which resulted in more rosette leaves . but the sam defects in most older ccs52a2- <dig> wus- <dig> double mutants were enhanced, producing more rosette leaves than those in wus- <dig> single mutants and delaying transition from the vegetative apex into the reproductive apex as is seen in wus- <dig>  100% of the 42-day-old ccs52a2- <dig> wus- <dig> plants  did not develop determinate inflorescence shoots, compared with 75% of wus- <dig> single mutants  harboring flowering shoots at the same age under our conditions .

primary seedling shoot meristem was analyzed in 12-day-old plants. det., determinate shoot. indet., indeteminated shoot.

ccs52a <dig> controls cell size and ploidy in differentiated cells during cell division
in a previous study, ccs52a <dig> was found to control the endocycle, as indicated by the low endoreduplication index  of mature leaves of the knockout lines ccs52a2ko  and the increased number of cells with a high dna ploidy level in ccs52a2oe leaves  <cit> . ccs52a2- <dig> mutants appeared dwarfed and had smaller leaves, stems and siliques in comparison with wt . we hypothesized that these phenotypes might be due to decreased cell quantities and/or smaller cell sizes, so we analyzed the cell size and number of mature 5th leaves. in comparison to wt, the 5th mature leaves of ccs52a2- <dig> mutants show a decrease of  <dig> % in mesophyll cell size  and a decrease of  <dig> % in total mesophyll cell number , and a significant cell size decrease  was also detected in abaxial epidermal cells . to test if the cell size decrease corresponds with lower ploidy levels, we measured the nuclear size of the abaxial epidermal cells in leaf peels. statistical analysis demonstrated that that the mutant leaf cells with 16c ploidy made up a significantly lower percentage than in wt, while the mutant leaf cells of 2c ploidy showed a slightly higher percentage in the mutant . the cycle value  of 5th leaves in the cca52a2- <dig> plant was lower  than the wt   <cit> , consistent with lower ei of ccs52a2ko leaves determined by flow cytometry in the previous report  <cit> . therefore, we believed that loss of ccs52a <dig> function results in the decrease in cell size and ploidy level in mature leaves. however, as measured by flow cytometry, the cv of sam cells in 8-day-old ccs52a2- <dig> seedlings was unaffected in comparison with wt . despite the enlarged cell area of meristem cells in mutant sams , the cell ploidy was not correspondingly changed, which means, unlike in the leaf, ccs52a <dig> did not induce the onset of endocycle in the shoot meristems. the earlier published data of the ram in ccs52a <dig> knockout lines  also showed that ccs52a2-mediated control over root development did not involve endoreduplication  <cit> .

cycb1; <dig> was revealed as one of the possible substrates of apc/c to interact with ccs52s  in arabidopsis <cit> . since ccs52a <dig> acts at g2/m to control mitosis exit and endocycle entry, we checked the expression of the g2/m transition reporter gene cycb 1; <dig> in ccs52a2- <dig> mutants. we monitored gfp reporters in the root tips of marker lines harboring cycb1;1::gfp in a ccs52a2- <dig> mutant background by confocal microscopy. the results showed that the number of ram cells expressing cycb1; <dig> was dramatically reduced, and the range of cells expressing cycb1; <dig> in root was shorter in 7-day-old ccs52a2- <dig> compared with wt . in addition, qrt pcr was carried out to quantify the expression levels of cycb1; <dig> in the shoot. the seedling sam of ccs52a2- <dig> showed lower expression level in comparison with that of wt . reduction of cycb1; <dig> expression in both the sam and ram indicated that the cell cycle process was disturbed in ccs52a2- <dig> mutants.

ccs52a <dig> interacted with mgo <dig> and fas1
the mgo1- <dig> and fas1- <dig> mutants display fasciation and bifurcation in both vegetative and reproductive development  <cit> , similar to the phenotype of ccs52a2- <dig> mutants. the similarity of the phenotypes compelled us to figure out whether these genes act in the same pathway and/or affect the same downstream processes as ccs52a <dig>  to study their genetic relationship we constructed ccs52a2- <dig> fas1- <dig> and ccs52a2- <dig> mgo1- <dig> double mutants. the ccs52a2- <dig> mgo1- <dig> double mutants were indistinguishable from mgo- <dig>  under our conditions, suggesting that mgo <dig> may be epistatic to ccs52a <dig>  the ccs52a2- <dig> fas1- <dig> double mutants possessed many characteristics of both parents, but can be easily distinguished from either single mutant . they have narrow leaves and disrupted floral phyllotaxy as in fas1- <dig>  with bifurcation and premature termination characteristic of ccs52a2- <dig>  however, the bifurcation ratio of inflorescences is higher than ccs52a2- <dig> single mutants . many ccs52a2- <dig> fas1- <dig> double mutants displayed a large number of rosette leaves with a bushy appearance in the mature plant . the novel phenotype of ccs52a2- <dig> fas1- <dig> double mutants revealed that fas <dig> and ccs52a <dig> are involved in the same downstream process.

discussion
ccs52a <dig> is necessary for the normal structure and function of the sam in arabidopsis
this article demonstrates that loss of ccs52a <dig> function in ccs52a2- <dig> mutants led to novel morphological defects in the sam. the ccs52a2- <dig> mutant displays concomitant premature termination of floral shoots with frequent bifurcation of the shoot apices, stems, and flowers. these defects in meristems indicate that the ccs52a <dig> gene is essential for the proper maintenance and function of the sam in plant development. interestingly, the vegetative meristem and inflorescence meristem were larger and smaller than that of wt, respectively. one possible explanation for this is that that the double wus expression zones in the 8-day-old mutant are indicative of bifurcation originating at this time. lateral splitting results two smaller sams, each with a reduced wus expression domain, and which later give rise to smaller inflorescence sams that terminate prematurely.

expression changes of the major sam regulator genes wus and clv <dig> in ccs52a2- <dig> were observed. ectopic clv <dig> expression was detected in the first layer of the sam , and the presence of more than one wus and/or clv <dig> expression region in a single sam of ccs52a2- <dig> seedlings reveals a rare maintenance pattern in higher plant meristems. all of these abnormal expression patterns of sam regulators indicate that malfunction of ccs52a <dig> affects cell identity in meristems. previously published data show that the ccs52a <dig> gene plays a role in qc identity in root development, as the ram organizing genes show irregular expression domains and locations and a failure to maintain the low mitotic activities of cells in qc zone in ccs52a2- <dig> root  <cit> . we here provide evidence that the expression of sam organizers are also altered in ccs52a2- <dig>  and duplicate individual clv3-wus regulatory centers are sometimes generated in the mutant sam. one possible explanation for this is that the proliferation of cells in oc zone results from a partial loss of cell division control, leading to formation of new and separate clv3-wus regulation systems in a single sam of the mutant. considering the role of ccs52a <dig> in the root, we give a hypothesis is that the duplicated ocs may somehow result from the failure to maintain low mitotic levels in certain sam cells, with more cells available to fulfill certain roles.

ccs52a <dig> synergistically interacts with sam organizers
we suspect that ccs52a <dig> regulates the development of meristems by indirectly interacting with the wus and clv <dig> genes. this hypothesis is firstly supported by up-regulated expression of clv <dig> and wus in the sam of ccs52a2- <dig> seedlings . additionally, the more severe phenotypes seen in ccs52a2- <dig> clv3- <dig> and ccs52a2- <dig> clv1- <dig> double mutants indicate that ccs52a <dig> may function in separate genetic pathways but are involved in the same process with clv <dig> and clv <dig>  and disrupting multiple modes of cell division regulation in meristems leads to a greater likelihood of a very large loss of cell division control and massive overproliferation. the finding of more severe bifurcations from the larger sams  of ccs52a2- <dig> clv double mutants reveals that the bigger the size of the sam, the more bifurcations occurred. clv single mutant exhibits an expanded sam but has not been reported to undergo bifurcation.

the enhanced wus- <dig> phenotype in ccs52a2- <dig> wus- <dig> double mutant indicated that ccs52a <dig> contributes to meristem establishment and leaf initiation together with wus; however, ccs52a <dig> also acts in an independent pathway as well.

ccs52a <dig> functions in the sam and stimulates the onset of endocycle in mature leaves
previous studies suggest that ccs52a <dig> is an activator of apc/c, which mediates protein proteolysis during mitosis  <cit> . therefore, it could regulate sam maintenance and development by regulating cell division. our hypothesis is consistent with cell cycle impairment, as indicated by the lower cycb1; <dig> expression in ram and sam of ccs52a2- <dig> . however, the enlargement of the sam is mainly due to enlarged cell areas and not increased cell number, which indicates that cell proliferation is still under control in mutant sams even if impairment exists in the cell cycle. ccs52a <dig> has also been reported to promote the exit from the cell cycle into the endocycle, and leads to endoreduplication by association with apc/c in medicago truncatula <cit> . in arabidopsis, similar effects are seen in ccs52a <dig> knockout  and overexpression  lines  <cit> . however, in this paper, the unchanged cv  of the sam indicates that the enlarged stem cells are not due to the entrance into endocycle in ccs52a2- <dig>  this is consistent with previous studies that ccs52a <dig> is not correlated with the endocycle in the ram in ccs52a2ko, which exhibits a normal endoreduplication index in the mutant  <cit> . but in mature leaves, the presence of smaller cells with lower cv of cells in ccs52a <dig> mutants indicates a role for ccs52a <dig> in these tissues. taken together, these studies further supports the idea that ccs52a <dig> only has obvious effects on modulating endocycle onset in differentiating cells and not in undifferentiated cells.

ccs52a <dig>  a homolog of ccs52a <dig>  has also been reported to control the endocycle of cells in mature leaves  <cit> . the similar ploidy changes in null mutants of ccs52a <dig> and ccs52a <dig> signify these two genes overlap in function in endoredupliction onset, but that they are not redundant.

ccs52a <dig> was involved in chromatin remodeling
plants carrying a mutation in the mgo <dig> gene exhibit some phenotypes similar to ccs52a2- <dig> mutants  <cit> , such as bifurcation of stems. mgo <dig> encodes an arabidopsis type ib dna topoisomerase, which functions in the relaxation of supercoiled dna and acts in a number of different dna metabolic processes, including replication, transcription, repair, and chromatin compaction  <cit> . it has been reported that mgo <dig> cooperates with chromatin regulators and is necessary for the maintenance of several epigenetically regulated genes  <cit> . the indistinguishable phenotypes of ccs52a2- <dig> mgo1- <dig> double mutants compared to the mgo1- <dig> single mutant revealed that these two genes might be involved in the same pathway. recently, it was found that mutation of mgo <dig> suppresses ectopic wus activity and enhances stem cell defects in wus mutants  <cit> . likewise, lack of ccs52a <dig> enhances the sam defect in wus- <dig>  which further supports a functional relationship between mgo <dig> and ccs52a <dig>  and imply that their functions may converge to a common downstream process with wus in stem cell regulation  <cit> . mgo <dig> and ccs52a <dig> proteins are both factors regulating cell cycle processes. it would be interesting to further investigate the molecular nature of the link between ccs52a <dig> and mgo <dig> 

fas <dig> is another fasciated mutant that displays stem bifurcation, as do ccs52a2- <dig> and mgo <dig>  fas <dig> encodes one subunit of the chromatin assembly factor , which coordinates nucleosome assembly during dna replication and repair by depositing newly synthesized histone h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> . defects in fas <dig> lead to a halt in the progression through g <dig> by up-regulating several genes involved in the g <dig> dna checkpoint, which it accomplishes by changing epigenetic marks of their promoters  <cit> . the novel phenotypes of ccs52a2- <dig> fas1- <dig> double mutants demonstrate the two genes have a synergistic interaction in sam development. the shared phenotypes of plants that have defects in either fas <dig>  mgo <dig> or ccs52a <dig> reveal a possibility that these three genes might be involved in the same downstream processes. thus, fas <dig> modulates the epigenetic states of genes involved in the g <dig> damage checkpoint, while mgo <dig> acts in dna repair and maintains the expression of several epigenetically regulated genes  <cit> . additionally, studies on nodule organogenesis indicate that ccs52a proteins mediate the degradation of mitotic cyclins in the proper phases of the cell cycle to inactivate cdks, eventually blocking the g <dig> to m transition and thereby triggering endoreduplication  <cit> . previous expression profile analysis of different cell samples in the sam reveals an enrichment of dna repair and chromatin modification pathways in stem cells, which suggests that the maintenance of flexible chromatin may facilitate the dynamic balance of gene expression during sam development  <cit> . these results lend further evidence to the hypothesis that ccs52a <dig> might have a function related to triggering the g2/m transition, and that the signal pathways of ccs52a <dig>  fas <dig>  and mgo <dig> are all involved in epigenetic maintenance and the activation of the g <dig> checkpoint.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we showed that mutations in the ccs52a <dig> gene disrupted the normal structure and function of the sam in arabidopsis. ccs52a <dig> modulates the expression domains of the meristem regulatory gene wus and clv <dig>  moreover, double mutant analyses illustrates that ccs52a <dig> synergistically interacts with sam organizers. the cell cycle was disturbed in the absence of ccs52a <dig>  as indicated by reduced expression of cycb1;  <dig>  ccs52a <dig> is involved in control of cell size and ploidy in differentiated cells during cell division. furthermore, ccs52a <dig> is involved in chromatin remodeling with fas <dig> and mgo <dig>  which were previously reported to be involved in the activation of the g <dig> checkpoint and epigenetic maintenance. we propose that ccs52a <dig> regulates meristem organization, functions together with meristematic genes and cross-functions with chromatin regulators in cell cycle progression during sam development.
