BACKGROUND
molecular chaperones are a large group of proteins that can bind and stabilize non-native polypeptides and facilitate protein folding into their native conformations  <cit> . heat shock protein 70s  play essential roles in cell physiology and have been well studied  <cit> . members of the hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  families function in specific pairs that form transient complexes with non-native regions of polypeptides to promote the folding, assembly and transport of proteins within the cell  <cit> .

all types of hsp <dig> proteins contain a j-domain that can stimulate the atpase activities of hsp <dig>  both type i and type ii hsp40s have a peptide-binding fragment located at the c-terminus of the proteins. the n-terminal j-domains are connected to the peptide-binding fragments via a g/f rich linker in both type i and type ii hsp40s. type i hsp <dig> such as e. coli dnaj, yeast ydj <dig> and human hdj <dig> contain two zinc-finger motifs between the j-domain and the c-terminal peptide-binding fragment while type ii hsp <dig> proteins such as human hdj <dig> and yeast sis <dig> do not  <cit> . it was proposed that hsp <dig> binds non-native polypeptide first and then delivers the non-native polypeptide to hsp <dig> for folding  <cit> . the ability to bind non-native polypeptides for the cytosolic hsp <dig> is an essential function in vivo  <cit> .

the crystal structures of the peptide-binding fragments of ydj <dig> and sis <dig>  the type i and ii hsp <dig> proteins from s. cerevisiae, was determined to  <dig>  Å resolution, respectively  <cit> . the crystal structures revealed that both ydj <dig> and sis <dig> peptide-binding fragments functioned as a homo-dimer with a large cleft between the two elongated monomers. the sis <dig> monomer contains domain i, ii and a short c-terminal dimerization motif. a hydrophobic depression was revealed as the putative peptide-binding site on the molecular surface of the domain i of sis <dig> monomer  <cit> . in the crystal structure of ydj <dig> complexed with the peptide substrate, the domain i and domain iii of ydj <dig> resemble the structure of domain i and ii of sis <dig> while two zinc finger motifs form the domain ii of ydj <dig>  <cit> . the peptide substrate binds to the domain i of ydj <dig> and form a β-strand with the ydj <dig> molecule. the side chains of the peptide substrate make extensive hydrophobic interactions with a hydrophobic pocket located on domain i of ydj <dig> 

it has been showed that the extreme c-terminal four amino acid residues eevd within human hsp <dig> play regulatory roles in hsp40/hsp <dig> functions  <cit> . deletion of these four residues compromised the protein refolding capability of human hsp <dig> facilitated by the human hsp <dig> hdj <dig>  <cit> . the crystal structure of sis <dig> peptide-binding fragment complexed with the hsp <dig> ssa <dig> c-terminus has been determined  <cit> . the ssa <dig> extreme c-terminal eight amino acid residues gptveevd form a β-strand with the domain i of sis <dig> peptide-binding fragment. the ssa <dig> c-terminus binds sis <dig> at the site where sis <dig> interacts with the non-native polypeptides.

the human type ii hsp <dig> hdj <dig> has been shown to function as a molecular chaperone to promote efficient protein folding. hdj <dig> can bind to the non-native polypeptide and suppress the protein aggregation. hdj <dig> can also pair with hsp <dig> to refold the non-native polypeptides  <cit> . both of human hdj <dig> and yeast sis <dig> belong to type ii hsp <dig> family and they might have similar in vivo functions  <cit> . the crystal structure of hdj <dig> presented in this paper may reveal the mechanism by which hdj <dig> functions as a molecular chaperone to promote protein folding.

RESULTS
structure determination of the human hsp <dig> hdj <dig> putative peptide-binding fragment
we have expressed and purified the human type ii hsp <dig> hdj <dig> putative peptide-binding fragment . the protein was then crystallized by use of hanging drop vapor diffusion method. the crystal structure of the hdj <dig> putative peptide-binding fragment was determined to  <dig> Å resolution by the molecular replacement method using the sis <dig> structure as the search model . the resultant electron density map from the molecular replacement method allowed us to trace the residues  <dig> to  <dig> of hdj <dig> except for a short loop region .

hdj <dig> putative peptide-binding fragment forms a dimer in the crystal structure. the two monomers are related by a crystallographic two-fold axis. the structure of the hdj <dig>  monomer consists of eleven β-strands  and three short α-helixes . the hdj <dig> monomer structure contains domain i, ii and the c-terminal dimerization motif. both domain i and ii have a core formed by a major β-sheet and a minor β-sheet that are connected by a short helix. the two hdj <dig> monomers are associated into a homo-dimer through the c-terminal dimerization motif . the hdj <dig> homo-dimer forms a u-shaped architecture and a large cleft is formed between the two elongated monomers.

the comparison between human hsp <dig> hdj <dig> and yeast hsp <dig> sis <dig> structures
we have previously determined the crystal structure of yeast type ii hsp <dig> sis <dig> peptide-binding fragment at  <dig>  Å resolution  <cit> . therefore, it is of interest to compare these two hsp <dig> protein structures from different species . both hdj <dig> and sis <dig> monomer structures contain domain i, domain ii and the c-terminal dimerization motif. the individual domains from hdj <dig> and sis <dig> structure share similar folds. the hdj <dig> dimer and sis <dig> dimer have a similar u-shaped molecular shape with a large cleft between the monomers .

however, significant differences exist between hdj <dig> and sis <dig> structures. when the domain ii of hdj <dig> is superimposed with that of the sis <dig> structure, we found that the domain i of hdj <dig> in the complex structure was kinked about  <dig> ° away from that in sis <dig> structure . the domain re-arrangements within hdj <dig> were achieved by the rotation of the linker region between domain i and domain ii .

the domain arrangements between domain i and ii of hdj <dig> cause the two domain is within the hdj <dig> dimer closer to each other when compared with sis <dig> structure . this makes the cleft between two monomers within hdj <dig> smaller than that of sis <dig>  the relative positions of the domain iis and the c-terminal dimerization motifs within the hdj <dig> and sis <dig> homo-dimers, however, are kept almost the same when superimposed . the structural differences between hdj <dig> and sis <dig> structures indicate that the domain i of hsp <dig> may possess significant flexibility. this flexibility may be important for hsp <dig> to interact with non-native polypeptides and transfer them to hsp <dig> 

another major difference between hdj <dig> and sis <dig> structure is at the tip region of the domain i. the sequence alignment indicates that human hsp <dig> hdj <dig> has five more amino acid residues between β-strand b <dig> and b <dig> than sis <dig> from yeast, while hdj <dig> has one fewer residue between β-strand b <dig> and b <dig> than sis <dig> . when the domain is from hdj <dig> and sis <dig> structures are superimposed, we found that the loop between b <dig> and b <dig> in hdj <dig> structure protrudes significantly further away than that in sis <dig> structure. the longer loop region at the tip of domain i in the hdj <dig> structure helps to constitute a larger domain i than that in sis <dig> structure. sequence alignment shows that the loop region between b <dig> and b <dig> is longest for human and mouse type ii hsp <dig> among all species. it is two amino acid residues shorter in c. elegans and drosophila and five amino acid residues shorter in yeast s. cerevisiae .

on the other hand, the loop region between b <dig> and b <dig> in hdj <dig> is one residue shorter than that in sis <dig> structure . because part of the electron density is missing for this loop region in hdj <dig> structure, it is difficult for us to compare this region between hdj <dig> and sis <dig> structure. the sequence alignment indicates that only sis <dig> from s. cerevisiae has the longer loop between b <dig> and b <dig>  all the other type ii hsp40s, however, contain the shorter version of the loop between b <dig> and b <dig> 

the peptide-binding site of human hsp <dig> hdj1
molecular chaperone hsp <dig> can interact and stabilize the non-native polypeptides and prevent them from forming aggregations. the peptide-binding sites of both type i and type ii hsp40s for the non-native polypeptides have been located on the molecular surface of domain i. the hsp40s may bind the non-native polypeptides through hydrophobic interactions  <cit> . when we examined the peptide-binding site on the domain i of hdj <dig> structure, several hydrophobic residues were identified to participate in forming the peptide-binding site. these residues include l <dig>  m <dig>  i <dig> and f <dig> . the hydrophobicity of these residues is well conserved among all species. however, a polar residue, h <dig>  was also identified to be involved in constituting the peptide-binding pocket . this histidine residue is conserved for type ii hsp40s among all species except for yeast as shown in sequence alignment . we reason that h <dig> may play an important role in positioning the side chains from pro, phe or tyr residues through van der waals interactions.

hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> form transient complex to facilitate the efficient protein folding process  <cit> . it has been reported that hsp <dig> may interact with the hsp <dig> c-terminal eevd motif by use of the peptide-binding site located on hsp <dig> domain i  <cit> . the crystal structure of yeast hsp <dig> sis <dig> and hsp <dig> ssa <dig> c-terminus complex indicated that several lysine residues  in sis <dig> are involved in binding the hsp <dig> c-terminal eevd motif by charge-charge interactions. the sequence alignment shows that the corresponding residues in hdj <dig> are k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and k <dig>  in the hdj <dig> structure, k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> are well-positioned to interact with the eevd motif from hsp <dig> . k <dig> and k <dig> are stabilized by forming salt bridges with a conserved e <dig>  r <dig>  however, points to the opposite direction from the peptide-binding site of hdj <dig> and it is not likely to be involved in binding hsp <dig> eevd. k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> are all conserved for type ii hsp <dig> among all species. therefore these positively charged residues may be the common residues for type ii hsp40s to interact with the hsp <dig> c-terminal eevd motifs.

discussion
we report the crystal structure of human type ii hsp <dig> hdj <dig> putative peptide-binding fragment to  <dig> Å resolution. the structure reveals that hdj <dig> forms a homo-dimer in the crystal by a crystallographic two-fold axis. the hdj <dig> dimer has a u-shaped architecture and a large cleft is formed between the two elongated monomers. the human hdj <dig> structure is similar to the s. cerevisiae hsp <dig> sis <dig>  which may account for the fact that hdj <dig> and sis <dig> share similar in vivo functions  <cit> . however, the two structures have significant differences. when compared with yeast type ii hsp <dig> sis <dig> structure, the domain i of hdj <dig> shows a  <dig> ° rotation from the main body of the molecule, which makes the cleft between two hdj <dig> monomers smaller. in the crystal structure of hdj <dig>  a polar residue h <dig> is involved in forming the peptide-binding site, which is different from the hydrophobic peptide-binding depression revealed in sis <dig> structure. in addition, at the tip of domain i in hdj <dig> structure, hdj <dig> structure has a longer loop region than sis <dig>  which accounts for a larger domain i in hdj <dig> structure.

the domain re-arrangement between domain i and domain ii within type ii hsp <dig> has been observed when yeast hsp <dig> sis <dig> binds the hsp <dig> ssa <dig> c-terminus. little conformational changes occur within the individual domain i and domain ii of sis <dig> after binding to ssa <dig>  however, we found that the domain i of sis <dig> in the complex structure was kinked about  <dig> ° away from that in sis <dig> structure. these conformational changes widen up the cleft between the two sis <dig> monomers within the homo-dimer, where might be the docking site for ssa <dig> peptide-binding domain  <cit> . in contrast, when we compare the crystal structures of hdj <dig> and sis <dig> peptide-binding fragment, we found that the domain is within hdj <dig> were swung towards each other by  <dig> ° from that in sis <dig> structure, which makes the cleft between the two monomers smaller. these domain re-arrangements were achieved by the rotation of the linker region between domain i and domain ii within both sis <dig> and hdj <dig> structures. the relative positions of the domain iis within the sis <dig> and hdj <dig> dimer, however, are kept almost the same.

these structural observations indicate that domain i of hsp <dig> may possess significant flexibility to take different conformations for its molecular chaperone activity. the flexibility in sis <dig> could be important for the hsp40/hsp <dig> system to function. previous studies have shown that the mutations within the interface of domain i and domain ii in sis <dig> can abolish the binding capability of sis <dig> to ssa <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that the conformational changes of sis <dig> can not be achieved within these mutants to locate the domain i of sis <dig> into the ssa <dig> binding position.

in the sis <dig> structure, the peptide-binding site is occupied by a pro residue from a neighbor molecule. it is possible that the sis <dig> structure may represent the conformation for sis <dig> to bind the non-native polypeptide. the sis1-ssa <dig> complex structure may represent the conformation for sis <dig> to interact with hsp <dig> ssa <dig>  the peptide-binding site in the hdj <dig> structure is not occupied by any amino acid residue, so the hdj <dig> structure may represent the free hsp <dig> state. thus, hsp <dig> may take different conformations in these three states.

an "anchoring and docking" model for hsp <dig> to interact with hsp <dig> sis <dig> has been proposed, in which the hsp <dig> c-terminus may function as an anchor to bind to hsp <dig>  <cit> . the studies in this paper may add significant more details into the model . when the hsp <dig> is free of non-native polypeptides, it may keep a relatively small cleft within the dimer structure. the cleft may be widened up when hsp <dig> binds the non-native polypeptide. the hsp <dig> c-terminal anchor region may bind the sis <dig> peptide-binding pocket and replace hydrophobic side chains from the non-native polypeptide. this may further widen up the cleft within hsp <dig> homo-dimer. the freed non-native polypeptide may be bound by hsp <dig> for subsequent protein folding .

the low resolution quaternary structures of full-length type i and type ii hsp40s have been determined by small angle x-ray scattering  <cit> . the small angel x-ray scattering studies indicated that the two j-domains within the type ii hsp <dig> dimer are positioned at two opposite ends. the relative positioning of hsp <dig> n-terminal domain and c-terminal domain has also been revealed by x-ray crystallography  <cit> . our working model is consistent with the results from previous structural studies.

it is not very clear what roles that the hsp <dig> conformational changes may play when binding the non-native polypeptides in hsp40/hsp <dig> molecular chaperone functions. several possibilities may exist.  <dig>  widening up the cleft while hsp <dig> interacts with non-native polypeptides may help to stretch the polypeptides into extended conformations. hsp <dig> prefers to bind the polypeptides in extended conformations.  <dig>  the enlarged cleft within the hsp <dig> homo-dimer may provide more space for hsp <dig> to dock and to interact with the non-native polypeptides.

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined the crystal structure of the putative peptide-binding fragment of hdj <dig>  a human member of the type ii hsp <dig> family. the  <dig> Å structure reveals that hdj <dig> forms a homodimer in the crystal by a crystallographic two-fold axis. the hdj <dig> dimer has a u-shaped architecture and a large cleft is formed between the two elongated monomers.

this structural observation indicates that the domain i of hsp <dig> may possess significant flexibility. this flexibility may be important for hsp <dig> to regulate the size of the cleft. we propose an "anchoring and docking" model for hsp <dig> to utilize the flexibility of domain i to interact with non-native polypeptides and transfer them to hsp <dig>
