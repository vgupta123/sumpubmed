BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major opportunistic human pathogen, causing infections mostly in patients with impaired immune systems  <cit> , or in people suffering from cystic fibrosis. it is also a cause of diseases in both livestock and companion animals, including otitis and urinary tract infections in dogs, mastitis in dairy cows, endometritis in horses and hemorrhagic pneumoniae in fur-bearing animals such as mink or foxes  <cit> .

p. aeruginosa is naturally resistant to many classes of drugs and its capacity to rapidly acquire resistance during treatment is a frequent source of therapeutic failures in humans  <cit> . it is generally admitted that the p. aeruginosa population is non clonal, i.e. that population structure of p. aeruginosa is highly diverse with a high number of clonal groups with no or poor association between clonal groups and ecological niches or specific diseases. moreover, human and environmental isolates are distinct, and there are no specific clones associated with a specific habitat, disease or animal species, except for a few multi-drug resistant clusters  that are spreading worldwide  <cit> .

however, since the structure of the p. aeruginosa population from animals remains unknown in france, the objective of this study was to provide a snapshot on the genetic diversity of this bacterium, to be compared with clones circulating in humans. in line with a possible risk of animal-to-human transfer, susceptibility of those isolates to antimicrobials used in human medicine was also investigated.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> isolates was genotyped by pfge and  <dig> different pulsotypes  were obtained . the eight very close pts were shared by two or three animals that had no epidemiological link and originated from diverse locations in france.

since pfge was proved to be more discriminatory than mlst, we considered that isolates with a very close pt shared the same st  <cit> . mlst was thus performed on one isolate representative of each of the  <dig> pts, leading to the identification of  <dig> distinct sts . among them,  <dig> were already registered in the mlst database while  <dig> were new . st <dig>  which was represented by very close pts in two dogs , was additionally found in a cow and a horse  presenting divergent pts. st <dig> and st <dig> were represented by  <dig> isolates, whereas  <dig> sts included  <dig> isolates . the  <dig> remaining sts were represented by a single isolate. three sts, including two new profiles, were recovered in both dogs and horses .

we then determined whether the clones of p. aeruginosa found in animals in france clustered on the global dendrogram of the  <dig> currently defined sts . the maximum likelihood  tree produced by the alignment of the concatenated gene sequences of the currently known sts displayed a bush-like structure showing the non-clonal structure of the species  <cit> . as illustrated by figure  <dig>  the  <dig> sts of our collection scattered throughout the ml tree.figure  <dig>

finally, we investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility of all p. aeruginosa isolates. susceptibilities to fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin were the most frequently affected, with  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of resistant isolates, respectively . resistant isolates mostly came from dogs and significant differences  in resistances compared to horses and cows were observed for ticarcillin – clavulanic acid, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. multidrug resistance  was absent in dairy cows and horses, whereas it was relatively common  in dog isolates . among these isolates, combinations of resistances to β-lactams-aminoglycosides-fosfomycin or to β-lactams-aminoglycosides-ciprofloxacin were the most frequently detected. no resistance to carbapenems was observed.table  <dig>

discussion
in veterinary medicine, p. aeruginosa is not a widespread pathogen but is responsible for a variety of difficult-to-treat infections. our study adds data to the limited comprehensive picture of the population structure of clinical p. aeruginosa from animals  <cit> , and highlights a high genetic diversity even though  <dig> clones were surprisingly not unique. both indistinguishable and very close pfge profiles were also found among mink p. aeruginosa from different regions in eastern china  <cit> , suggesting that certain p. aeruginosa clones, similarly to humans, would be more pathogenic to animals than others. these clones may spread either through a food or water supply, or may persist in the environment, as demonstrated for p. aeruginosa infecting mink  <cit> .

sts were also diverse with numerous new profiles . their scattering throughout the ml tree indicates a poor association between an animal species and a specific subset of the p. aeruginosa population. kidd et al. drew similar conclusions from eburst data and from the calculation of genetic diversity index on animal isolates recovered in queensland   <cit> . additionally, we identified five sts that are internationally widespread clones associated to human outbreaks and sometimes to multi-drug resistance phenotypes . these specific clones were found in nine dogs  and two horses . however, only one of these animal isolates, belonging to st <dig>  presented a multidrug resistant phenotype . seven sts  reported in this study were previously recovered in animals in south east queensland, australia  <cit> . on the contrary, two sts  responsible for outbreaks in australian horses were not retrieved in our collection  <cit> .

antimicrobial resistance was principally observed for fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, a situation that may be explained by the frequent veterinary use of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones in france, especially for dog otitis. however, the high proportion of fosfomycin-resistant isolates cannot be attributed to the use of this antibiotic, which is not authorized in veterinary medicine. multidrug patterns were only detected in dogs, possibly due to the fact that pets are more treated than horses and cows, or that these animals may have been sampled after a first treatment failure.

these data may differ from other reports in different animal species and countries  <cit> , even though comparing resistance rates obtained with different standards and sampling strategies is of limited value. of note, no carbapenem resistance was observed here, contrary to a recent report from a dog in china, which suggested a human-to-dog transfer  <cit> . notably, the most frequent epidemic clones associated to multidrug resistance in humans, also called ‘high-risk clones’, i.e. st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  were not recovered in our collection  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
p. aeruginosa is a major human pathogen that is still poorly documented in the veterinary field. here, we confirm the non-clonal epidemic structure of the p. aeruginosa population and suggest a poor association between an animal species and a specific clone, even though certain clones seem to be more prevalent than others. we found a low proportion of drug resistant p. aeruginosa in diseased cows and horses, except for fosfomycin. resistance phenotypes were much more frequent in dogs, and multidrug resistant p. aeruginosa seem to emerge mainly in those suffering from otitis. however, such multidrug phenotypes are still rare in other animal species which, at this stage, contrasts with the high resistance rates observed in human clinical isolates, notably to β-lactams  <cit> . nevertheless, antimicrobial resistance in animal p. aeruginosa should be closely monitored in the future, in line with possible animal-to-human transfers between pets and owners. this may be especially important for patients with cystic fibrosis, which often results from unique p. aeruginosa strains acquired in the environment of the patient.
