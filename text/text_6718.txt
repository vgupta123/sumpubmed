BACKGROUND
schwann cells  play a central role in the regeneration of peripheral nerve, and are essential for peripheral nerve development  <cit> . it is recognized that sc can provide an option for the treatment of diseases of central nervous system , such as multiple sclerosis  <cit> . in cns, sc transplantation can promote the re-growth of nerve fibres despite unfavorable environment  <cit> ; sc can remyelinate demyelinated axons of cns  <cit> . sc can clear debris by phagocytosis and break down devastated myelin  <cit> , which can provide an important prerequisite for successful remyelination in demyelinating diseases of cns  <cit> . however, it is difficult to obtain sufficient large number of sc for clinical use, so alternative cell systems are desired.

bone marrow stromal cells  can be obtained easily, can be expanded in culture conditions for autologous transplantation, and mscs can transdifferentiate along a sc lineage in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . so, mscs may be one of alternative cell systems for sc. however, for clinical use, mscs have presented problems: mscs procurement procedures are painful and frequently require general or spinal anesthesia and may yield low number of mscs upon harvest  <cit> . for these reasons, many researchers begin to investigate alternative sources for mscs.

adipose tissue, like bone marrow, is derived from embryonic mesoderm. cells isolated from adipose tissue, termed adipose-derived stem cells , are self-renewal and can differentiate along several mesenchymal tissue lineages, including adipocytes, osteoblasts, myocytes, chondrocytes, endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes  <cit> . adsc may also be induced into neurospheres  <cit>  and neuronal-like cells in vitro  <cit> , and intracerebral transplantation of human adsc can improve the neurological deficits after cerebral ischemia in rats  <cit> . subcutaneous adipose tissue is abundant, readily accessible, and relatively expendable. liposuction is a common surgical procedure and it is safe, and a large number of cells can be obtained with minimal risk  <cit> . adsc may be an ideal alternative cell source for sc. however, it is not known up to now whether adsc could be induced into sc.

in this study, we found that rat adsc could be converted into neurospheres, and these neurospheres could be induced into sc-like cells. sc-like cells could induce the differentiation of sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells efficiently, and could form myelin structures with neuronal neurites.

RESULTS
rat adsc characterization
within 3– <dig> passages after initial plating of the primary culture, rat adsc appeared to be a mono-layer of large and flat cells . confluent rat adsc showed a spindle-shaped, fibroblastic morphology. rat adsc could be passaged for at least  <dig> times, with a doubling time of  <dig>  days. flow cytometry analysis of rat adsc within 3– <dig> passages showed that rat adsc were cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive, but cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> negative . rat adsc did not spontaneously differentiate during culture expansion. when cultured in lineage-specific differentiation culture medium, rat adsc within 3– <dig> passages could undergo osteogenic  and adipogenic  differentiation. about  <dig> ± 3% of rat adsc within 3– <dig> passages were nestin positive , whereas almost all of rat adsc expressed mesodermal marker fibronectin . markers of neuronal or glial cell types, such as beta-tubulin iii, gfap, p <dig> and s- <dig> could not be detected in rat adsc .

conversion of rat adsc into neurospheres
adsc can be converted into neurospheres using a procedure similar to the one used for the propagation of neural stem cells  <cit> . rat adsc within 3– <dig> passages were detached, and re-plated in serum-free dmem/f <dig> medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor  and basic fribroblast growth factor . few cells adhered to the surface of flasks. a lot of small spheres of floating cells appeared after 2– <dig> days in conversion culture, and these spheres could proliferate in vitro for up to  <dig> months . neurospheres could be passaged every 7– <dig> days, with an estimated doubling time of  <dig> days. more than 90% of rat adsc converted into neurospheres. about  <dig> ± 7% of neurosphere cells expressed nestin , whereas only a small part of neurosphere cells expressed fibronectin . the expression of beta-tubulin iii, gfap, s- <dig> and p <dig> were undetectable in neurosphere cells . as soon as the neurospheres were plated in poly-l-lysine-coated chamber slides in neurobasal® medium supplemented with only b <dig>  the neurospheres began to spread across the growth surface . ten days after differentiation, a lot of differentiated neurosphere cells would gain a neuronal morphology, and the cell processes would grow much longer . immunostaining showed that  <dig> ± 6% and  <dig> ± 5% of the differentiated neurosphere cells were positive for neuronal marker beta-tubulin iii  and glial marker gfap , respectively.

neurospheres could be induced to differentiate along a sc lineage
triturated neurospheres were re-plated in poly-l-lysine-coated six-well chamber slides in sc differentiation medium which contained all-trans-retinoic acid , forskolin , platelet-derived growth factor  and heregulin. some bi-polar, spindle-like cells began to appear at  <dig> hours after differentiation, and almost all of cells were bi- or tri-polar, spindle-like at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after differentiation , similar to the cultured immature genuine sc. about  <dig> hours after differentiation, a lot of differentiated neurosphere cells  would aggregate and float, obviously dead. forty-eight hours after differentiation, we replaced the sc differentiation medium with dmem plus 10% fbs, then we observed that sc-like cells could survive, proliferate to a higher cell density  and could be passaged at least for  <dig> to  <dig> times without changing their morphology and phenotype. forty eight hours after differentiation, we detected the expression of nestin which is normally expressed in genuine sc  <cit>  and sc markers p <dig>  s- <dig> and gfap  <cit>  to evaluate the nature of sc-like cells. immunostaining showed that almost all of the sc-like cells expressed nestin , gfap  and s- <dig> , and  <dig> ± 5% of the sc-like cells expressed p <dig> .

sc-like cells could induce the differentiation of sh-sy5y cells efficiently
we used sh-sy5y cells to evaluate whether sc-like cells could secrete soluble factors since genuine sc can induce the differentiation of sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells efficiently through production of soluble factors  <cit> .

after being cultured in the conditioned medium  collected from sc-like cells for  <dig> days, part of sh-sy5y cells showed neurite outgrowth under phase contrast , whereas there was no neurite outgrowth in control group . immunofluorescent staining confirmed that  <dig> ± 6% of sh-sh5y cells expressed neuronal marker beta-tubulin iii after being cultured in cm from sc-like cells for  <dig> days ; in contrast, beta-tubulin iii positive cells were very rare or no in control group .

sc-like cells could form myelin structures with neuronal neurites
pc <dig> cells  were used to assess the myelinating capacity of sc-like cells since genuine sc can induce the differentiation of pc <dig> cells and form myelin structures with pc <dig> cell neurites  <cit> . pc <dig> cells had none or short processes. most of pc <dig> cells stretched out noticeable processes after being cultured in dmem plus 10% fbs for a few passages. addition of sc-like cells induced a rapid neuronal-like differentiation of pc <dig> cells, and extension of neurites could be observed. electron microscopy results showed that after  <dig> days, pc12/sc-like cell co-culture formed myelin structures, and a lot of myelin structures were compact . the myelin structures were composed of multiple layers of membranes . rat adsc could not form myelin structures with pc <dig> cell neurites .

discussion
our results demonstrate that rat adsc could be converted into neurospheres using a procedure similar to the one used for propagation of genuine neural stem cells. in addition to generating neuronal- and glial-like cells, neurosphere cells from rat adsc could differentiate into sc-like cells. we showed further that sc-like cells were functional since these cells could secrete soluble factors and form myelin structures with neuronal neurites. functional properties, especially formation of myelin structures with neuronal neurites, further indicated that sc-like cells from rat adsc were closely similar to genuine sc.

primary cultures of adipose tissue are heterogeneous, containing hepatopoietic cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and pericytes  <cit> . however, the number of these other cells is small, and the frequency of these other cells will diminish quickly through serial passages  <cit> . also, adsc can differentiate into several mesenchymal tissue lineages, including adipocyte and osteoblast. rat adsc within 3– <dig> passages we used in our experiment were cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> negative, and could undergo osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. all these characteristics of rat adsc in our experiments are consistent with previous reports  <cit> .

although adsc and mscs share many common biological characteristics, the two populations are not identical  <cit> . immunocytochemical analysis shows that surface epitope profiles of the two populations are different  <cit> ; although it is well established that both mscs and adsc can undergo chondrogenic differentiation  <cit> , kang et al show that adsc but not mscs could undergo chondrogenic differentiation under the conditions used in their study; adsc may have significantly higher neural differentiation capacities than those of mscs  <cit> ; the distinctions between the two populations may also extend down to the gene level  <cit> . although mscs can be induced to differentiate along sc lineage  <cit> , the differences between the two populations mentioned above suggest that whether adsc could be induced to differentiate along sc lineage needs to be confirmed.

some recent studies show that neural crest stem cells can be harvested by means of neurosphere method from various seemingly "mesodermal" tissues of adult animals, such as heart  <cit>  and hair follicular dermal papilla  <cit> . kang et al. show that adsc can be converted into neurospheres  <cit> , and a preliminary report further suggests that neurosphere cells derived from adsc may have neural crest-like properties  <cit> . in our experiment, since neurospheres converted from rat adsc could differentiate into sc-like cells which belong to peripheral nervous system, these neurospheres should have the characteristics of peripheral nervous system.

recently, nestin expression has also been observed in myogenic cells, hepatic cells and endothelial cells, which indicates that nestin may not be used as a specific marker for neural stem cells. however, in our experiment, neurosphere cells from rat adsc can be induced into neuronal- and glial-like cells, which strongly indicates that neurosphere cells derived from rat adsc have neural stem cell-like properties. hermann et al suggest that neural stem cell-like cells converted from mscs are real neural stem cells  <cit> . the immature neural stem cells would be more suitable for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases than fully differentiated neural cells, because fully differentiated neurons can not survive detachment and subsequent transplantation procedures  <cit> .

neural stem cells from cns can be maintained in an undifferentiated status by bfgf and egf  <cit> . when exposed to ra, neural stem cells will exit from cell cycle and differentiate into nerve cells  <cit> . in our experiment, neurosphere cells will differentiate in the presence of ra and in the absence of egf and bfgf.

fsk can elevate the level of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate  and camp signal may be an intracellular signal during several different stages of sc development. in cultured sc, camp elevation can mimick sc responses in the presence of axons during myelination in vivo  <cit> . in addititon, fsk can enhance the responsiveness of sc to sc mitogens, such as pdgf-bb and glial growth factor  <cit> . pdgf-bb can induce sc proliferation in the presence of serum and fsk  <cit> . heregulin is a subtype of neuregulin- <dig> and neuregulin- <dig> is now regarded as the pivotal signal that controls sc at every stage of the lineage  <cit> . neuregulin- <dig> type ii, also known as glial growth factor, can induce instructively cultured neural crest cells into sc  <cit> . in the presence of heregulin , mscs can be induced into sc-like cells  <cit> . a mixture of cytokines mentioned above may synergize to induce neurosphere cells into sc-like cells.

sc can produce a number of neurotrophic factors, and a combination of these and other sc-derived soluble factors have been referred to as 'anti-neuroblastoma' agents  <cit> . pigment epithelium-derived factor is now regarded as the key factor responsible for sc's ability to induce the differentiation of sh-sy5y cells  <cit> . it is likely that sc-like cells from rat adsc in our experiment produced at least some 'anti-neuroblastoma' agents produced by genuine sc since sc-like cells could induce the differentiation of sh-sy5y cells efficiently. sc-like cells induced from mscs can cause neurite growth of dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro  <cit> , which supports that sc-like cells from rat adsc may produce some soluble factors. these sc-derived factors, such as pigment epithelium-derived factor, can promote survival and neurite outgrowth of neurons. sc-like cells from adsc may be useful for the treatment of diseases in peripheral nervous system  and cns .

CONCLUSIONS
our research indicated that adsc could differentiate into sc-like cells in terms of morphology, phenotype and functional capacities. sc-like cells induced from adsc may be useful for the treatment of neurological diseases.
