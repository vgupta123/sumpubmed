BACKGROUND
plant growth, development and productivity are greatly affected by adverse environmental conditions such as drought, cold and high salinity. a plenty of genes have been reported to respond to these abiotic stresses. among them, transcription factor genes are important for adaptation to these stresses. several classes of transcription factors have been found to play important roles in plant stress tolerance through binding of cis-acting elements in the promoter region of stress-responsive genes  <cit> .

the trihelix transcription factor family is defined according to the highly conserved trihelix domain which specifically binds to the gt-elements  <cit> . the trihelix domain has similarities to the individual repeats of the myb family from which the trihelix may have been derived  <cit> . compared with other transcription factors, e.g. myb, ap2/erebp, bhlh, nac and wrky families with more than  <dig> members in arabidopsis, trihelix family is relatively small  <cit> . until now, there are  <dig> members in arabidopsis and  <dig> members in rice, and the members in arabidopsis can be grouped into five classes, namely gt- <dig>  gt- <dig>  sh <dig>  gtγ and sip <dig>  each class is named after the relevant founding member  <cit> .

since members of trihelix family specifically bind with gt elements, these proteins are also named as gt factor. the first trihelix transcription factor was identified in pea  and named gt- <dig> factor. it binds specifically to a light-responsive gt element, named box ii/gt1box , in the pea rbcs-3a gene promoter. the core sequence 5’-ggttaa-3’ is sufficient for light induction  <cit> . later, gt-elements were found in many promoters of genes, some of which were not responsive for light  <cit> . for instance, a gt element named site <dig>  found in the ribosomal protein gene rps <dig> promoter, represses transcription in non-photosynthetic tissues or cells  <cit> . box ii-related/gt- <dig> like element in the promoter region of pr-1a gene from tobacco is likely responsive to pathogen infection  <cit> . soybean scam- <dig> gene with gt- <dig> element in the promoter region interacts with gt1-like factor and can be induced by pathogen attack and nacl treatment  <cit> .

current information suggests that trihelix transcription factors not only regulate light-responsive genes  <cit>  but also play important roles in the regulation of developmental processes involving flowers, trichomes, stomata, embryos and seeds  <cit>  and in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> .

arabidopsis petal loss , which belongs to the gt- <dig> group, was the first trihelix gene identified associating with a morphogenetic function. ptl regulates petal and sepal growth, and sepal fusion  <cit> . rice shattering  <dig> gene encoding a sh4-type factor plays an important role in activation of cell separation, and a mutation in the trihelix domain results in the elimination of seed shattering in cultivated rice  <cit> . more recently, asil <dig>  belonging to a new subfamily of trihelix family, has been found to function as a negative regulator of a large subset of arabidopsis embryonic and seed maturation genes in arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> . the role for gt-3b in responding to salt and pathogen stress is also identified in arabidopsis. gt-3b expression is rapidly induced by nacl and pseudo-monas syringae infection and gt-3b binds to a gt-like element  in the promoter of a calmodulin gene   <cit> . we demonstrates that overexpression of gmgt-2a or gmgt-2b from soybean enhanced tolerance to salt, drought and freezing stresses in transgenic arabidopsis plants  <cit> .

although the roles of the gt factors are gradually disclosed, the regulatory functions of this kind of transcription factors in abiotic stress response remains largely unknown. in the present study, we find that expression of gt- <dig> is induced by high salinity. mutation of the gene causes sensitivity to salt stress and transgenic plants overexpressing gt- <dig> exhibits salt tolerance compared to col- <dig>  we further identified a b <dig> and ap2/erf domain-containing protein  that interacted with gt- <dig>  loss function of tem <dig> in gt- <dig> mutant affected plant performance under salt stress. the downstream gene cor15a was co-regulated by gt- <dig> and tem <dig>  the gt- <dig> may associate with tem <dig> to co-activate cor15a for salt stress tolerance.

RESULTS
gt- <dig> expression and protein subcellular localization
there are  <dig> members of gt family in arabidopsis and we examined expressions of all of these genes in response to various stresses  <cit> . one of the stress-responsive genes, named gt- <dig> , was further analyzed. gt- <dig> encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids and the protein had a trihelix dna binding domain in the n-terminus and a variable c-terminus. arabidopsis seedlings were treated with salt stress and the expression of gt- <dig> was clearly induced by high salinity . the expression of gt- <dig> was also examined in different organs of arabidopsis plant. figure 1b showed that gt- <dig> expressed ubiquitously and was abundant in rosette leaves and pods but less expressed in roots .figure  <dig>

we determined the subcellular localization of gt- <dig>  gt- <dig> was fused to the gfp gene in a transient expression vector. the fusion gene and gfp control driven by camv 35s promoter were transformed into arabidopsis protoplasts to observe the localization of gt- <dig>  the green fluorescence from gt-4-gfp fusion protein was localized in both nuclear and cytoplasm regions . the gfp control protein was similarly localized.

transcriptional activation ability of gt-4
gt factors usually function as transcription factors and we measured the transcriptional activation ability of gt- <dig> by using a dual-luciferase reporter  assay system in arabidopsis protoplasts  <cit> . different regions of gt- <dig> were also examined for the activation. the domains of gt- <dig> were analyzed using smart program and gt- <dig> protein was divided into n-terminal  and c-terminal . the full length, n-terminal  and c-terminal  coding regions of gt- <dig> protein were fused to the gal <dig> dna-binding domain to generate pbd-gt- <dig>  pbd-gt-4-n and pbd-gt-4-c effector plasmids respectively . the fusion genes were driven by the 35s promoter plus a translational enhancer Ω. the firefly luciferase gene  driven by a mini-35s  promoter with five copies of the gal <dig> binding element was used as a reporter , and the renilla luciferase gene driven by the arabidopsis ubiquitin <dig> promoter was used as an internal control. vp <dig>  a herpes simplex virus -encoded transcriptional activator protein was used as a positive control. the gal <dig> dna-binding domain in the fusion proteins binds to the gal <dig> binding element upstream of the reporter luc gene, and the activation domain in the tested proteins activates luc gene transcription. compared with the gal4-dbd negative control, full length gt- <dig> and c-terminal region  of gt- <dig> could activate the reporter gene, whereas the n-terminal region  of gt- <dig> didn’t have the ability to activate reporter gene expression . the results indicated that gt- <dig> and its c-terminal domain possess transcriptional activation ability.

dna-binding ability of gt-4
gt proteins specifically bind to gt elements, and the elements are highly degenerated. gt- <dig> and gt- <dig> proteins with one trihelix dna-binding domain specially bind to box ii core sequence  and the 5’-gttac-3’ sequence respectively. gt- <dig> protein with two trihelix dna-binding domains can bind to gt- <dig> box  and gt- <dig> box  sequences  <cit> . there are reports that trihelix proteins resemble those of myb proteins  <cit> . several known gt elements and myb protein binding elements were selected as binding elements  to identify the dna-binding ability of the present gt- <dig> by emsa . gt- <dig> formed a complex with p <dig> , p <dig>  and p <dig> , and the intensity of the retarded bands were dramatically reduced when non-labeled competitors were included , indicating that gt- <dig> specifically binds to these elements. it should be noted that the gt- <dig> may also bind to the p <dig>  and p <dig>  probes since addition of the competitors seemed to reduce the band intensities slightly .figure  <dig>

performance of mutant gt- <dig> and transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing gt- <dig> under salt stress
to elucidate the biological function of gt- <dig>  one t-dna insertion mutant was identified and designated as gt- <dig> . the t-dna insertion was located in the first exon of gt- <dig>  and was confirmed by pcr . no full-length transcript of gt- <dig> was detected in the mutant gt- <dig> by rt-pcr , suggesting that gt- <dig> was loss-of-function mutant. transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing gt- <dig> driven by the camv 35s promoter were generated. at least  <dig> transgenic lines were obtained, and two independent homozygous lines  l <dig> and l <dig> with relatively high expression of gt- <dig>  were further investigated. since gt- <dig> was responsive to salt stress, we tested if it is involved in regulation of stress tolerance. under normal growth condition, mutant gt- <dig>  gt-4-oe and col- <dig> plants showed normal growth . all plants  were transferred to soils in pots saturated with nacl solutions and grew for 5 weeks . the gt- <dig> mutants were more sensitive to salt and transgenic plants were more tolerant to salinity than col- <dig> as can be seen from both the growth performance and the survival rate under 125 mm and 150 mm nacl treatments . these results indicate that gt- <dig> plays a positive role in the regulation of plant tolerance to salt stress.figure  <dig>

gt- <dig> regulates expressions of cor15a
expression of stress-related genes was examined in mutant gt- <dig> and gt-4- overexpressing plants grown under normal condition by quantitative pcr. compared with that in col- <dig>  the expressions of cor15a  was enhanced in gt-4-oe lines but decreased in gt- <dig> plants . the result implies that gt- <dig> may confer stress tolerance through activation of cor15a. we determined whether gt- <dig> regulates cor15a by direct binding to its promoter region and the emsa was performed. since gt protein can bind to gt-3b box, gt- <dig> may bind to the same element in the promoter region of downstream genes. a 60 bp dna fragment from the cor15a promoter was identified to contain the gt-3b box. gt- <dig> was found to specifically bind to this sequence from cor15a promoter . these results indicate that gt- <dig> most likely activates cor15a expression through direct binding to the gt-3b box in its promoter region.figure  <dig>

gt- <dig> interacts with tem <dig>  a protein with b <dig> and ap2/erf domain
transcription factors were reported to interact with the same family proteins or other transcription factors  <cit> . the proteins interacted with gt- <dig> were identified by using a yeast two-hybrid assay system. gt-4-coding sequence was cloned into pgbkt <dig> vector and the recombinant bd-gt- <dig> protein was used as a bait to screen an arabidopsis prey cdna library. among four unique genes encoding putative gt-4-interacting proteins, a cdna encoding a transcription factor tem <dig>  containing an ap2/erf domain was selected for further investigation. to clarify the interaction, the coding sequence of tem <dig> was fused to the 3’-end of the gal <dig> activation domain  coding region to generate pgadt7-tem <dig>  combinations corresponding to ad-tem <dig> mating with bd-gt- <dig> showed a clear positive interaction on the qdo/x/a plate . we also investigated the interacting domain of gt- <dig> with tem <dig>  and found that the c-terminal but not the n-terminal end of gt- <dig> interacted with tem <dig> . furthermore, gt- <dig> can form homo-dimer itself . bd-gt- <dig>  bd-gt-4 n, bd-gt-4c, ad-gt- <dig> and ad-tem <dig> fusion plasmids were respectively transfected into the yeast cells as negative controls and the corresponding proteins showed no auto-activation or dna-binding abilities .figure  <dig>

to visualize the co-localization of gt- <dig> and tem <dig>  the full-length coding sequences  of gt- <dig> and tem <dig> without stop codon were cloned into pgwb <dig> and pgwb <dig> vectors with c-terminal sgfp and mrfp fusion respectively. confocal analysis revealed that the gt- <dig> and tem <dig> co-localized in the nucleus .

a bimolecular fluorescence complementation  system was used to further characterize the interaction between gt- <dig> and tem <dig> in planta. gt- <dig> tagged with c-terminal  and tem <dig> tagged with n-terminal of yellow fluorescent protein  were transiently co-expressed in arabidopsis protoplasts, and the yellow fluorescence was detected in the nuclei of arabidopsis protoplasts . however, yc-gt- <dig> and yn or yn-tem <dig> and yc did not exhibit any fluorescence . these results suggest that gt- <dig> can interact with tem <dig> in the nuclei of plant cells.

to further confirm the interaction between gt- <dig> and tem <dig> in vivo, a co-immunoprecipitation  assay was performed. two constructs 35s-myc-tem <dig> and 35s-gt-4-flag were produced using the gateway system. argo-infiltration procedure was then performed with minor modifications. proteins were isolated from tobacco leaves expressing 35s-myc-tem <dig> and 35s-gt-4-flag, and then incubated with anti-c-myc agarose beads. the proteins were then eluted and followed by western blotting analysis with anti-flag or anti-myc antibodies. figure 5e showed that gt- <dig> interacted with tem <dig> in an in vivo assay.

the gt- <dig> and tem <dig> affect salt stress response via co-regulation of cor15a
previous reports have found that tem <dig> acts as a transcriptional repressor and is regulated by light and the circadian clock. over-expression of tem <dig> severely delayed the flowering time of arabidopsis  <cit> , yet the role of tem <dig> in salt stress response is unclear. we thus analyzed the function of tem <dig> in salt stress responses. the expression of tem <dig> was suppressed after initiation of salinity and then recovered to normal level subsequently . one t-dna insertion mutant was identified and designated as tem <dig> . the insertion was located in the only exon  and was confirmed by pcr . no tem <dig> expression was detected in the mutant by qrt-pcr , suggesting that tem <dig> is a loss-of-function mutant.figure  <dig>

to further analyze the mechanism of gt- <dig> and tem <dig> in salt stress response, gt- <dig> mutant was crossed with tem <dig> mutant to obtain double mutant gt-4/tem <dig>  we then examined the salt stress response of col- <dig>  gt- <dig>  tem <dig> and gt-4/tem <dig>  the 10-day-old col- <dig> and mutant plants were transferred into soil saturated with 150 mm nacl and maintained for a period of  <dig> d. no obvious difference was observed between col- <dig> and tem <dig>  whereas a remarkably low number of gt-4/tem <dig> plants were found to survive the exposure to salinity in comparison with the control and gt- <dig> plants . under normal condition, no obvious difference was observed between col- <dig> and various mutants .

real-time quantitative pcr analysis was performed to examine the expressions of cor15a in col- <dig>  gt- <dig>  tem <dig>  gt-4/tem <dig> mutant plants and gt-4-oe line  <dig>  under salt stress. the col- <dig> and tem <dig> displayed similar levels of cor15a expression under salt stress. the gl- <dig> mutant showed an approximate two-fold decrease of cor15a expression compared to the col- <dig> level throughout the treatments. in the double mutant gt-4/tem <dig>  more severe decrease of cor15a expression was observed than those in the other plants tested. cor15a transcript level in l <dig> was always higher than that in col- <dig> .

we further confirmed qpcr results by an in vivo transient luciferase expression system. the cor15a promoter was fused to the luc reporter, and the resulting construct was co-transformed into tobacco leaves with pgwb454-tem <dig> and/or pgwb454-gt- <dig>  we found that gt- <dig> could activate the cor15a promoter activity whereas tem <dig> didn’t significantly affect this activity. the activation was stronger when these two proteins were co-expressed . these results indicate that gt-4/tem <dig> complex are transcriptional activator of cor15a expression to regulate salt response.

discussion
previously, we have found that soybean trihelix transcription factors gmgt-2a and gmgt-2b improve plant tolerance to abiotic stresses in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit> . gt2l was reported to interact with calmodulin and respond to salt stress and regulate expression of rd29a and erd <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, gt- <dig> was identified to be stress-responsive and conferred salt tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis plants through regulation of downstream gene cor15a. the gt- <dig> mutant was sensitive to salt stress as revealed by phenotypic change. gt- <dig> binds to the gt-3b box in the cor15a promoter and activates its expressions. a b <dig> and ap2/erf domain containing protein tem <dig> was identified to interact with gt- <dig> and jointly regulate salt tolerance.

various binding elements of trihelix proteins have been identified. previous study showed that the gt- <dig> recombinant protein binds to the gt1-box, gt2-box and gt3-box  <cit> . however, the positions of the indicated gt- <dig> protein/dna complex are very low and near to the free probe regions  <cit> . the gt- <dig> gene is also induced by light  <cit> . in our present study, we found that gt- <dig> not only binds to the gt-elements, such as gt- <dig> box and gt-3b box, but also bind to the myb protein binding element mre <dig> with weaker affinity . in addition, the position of our protein/dna complex is high compared to that from murata et al.  <cit> . this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that we used probe elements with two or three repeats whereas murata et al.  used only one repeat  <cit> . moreover, the higher positions of the protein/dna complex in figure  <dig> may also be due to the dimerization of the gt- <dig> protein since it has the ability to form dimers .

transcription factors have either transcriptional activation or suppression activities. hao et al.  reported that gmnac <dig> had transcriptional activation activity whereas gmnac <dig> had suppression activity, and have identified a nard domain in plant nac-type transcription factors for suppression of transcriptional activation  <cit> . cotton tcp protein ghtcp <dig> contains transcriptional activation activity, however, it can directly down-regulate the expression of pin <dig> possibly by its interaction with other proteins  <cit> . a rice gt- <dig> protein has been found to function as a transcriptional activator. however, the activation domain was not identified  <cit> . arabidopsis gt- <dig> also has transactivation function in both yeast and plant cells  <cit> . gtl <dig> functions as a transrepressor for sdd <dig> gene in stomatal development in arabidopsis  <cit> . presently, we find that gt- <dig> exhibited transcriptional activation activity in protoplast assay and the activation domain may be located in the c-terminal end  of gt- <dig> . the n-terminal end  containing the trihelix domain may function as the dna-binding domain. the minimal domain for transcriptional activation needs further study.

gt- <dig> may enhance stress tolerance by regulating downstream stress-responsive gene cor15a through direct binding to the gt-3b box in the cor15a promoter . the cor15a protein shows homology to the lea protein family. the cor15a may protect lactate dehydrogenase from aggregation during stress  <cit> . overexpression of the cor15a gene in arabidopsis leads to accumulation of the protein in chloroplast stroma and confers freezing tolerance  <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing cor15a exhibited greater nacl tolerance than the wild-type in saline soil  <cit> . therefore, increased expression of cor15a in gt- <dig> overexpression plants may provide protection by preventing damage of chloroplast membrane and enzymes from salt stress. it should be noted that in gt- <dig> overexpressing plants, the gt- <dig> expression is enhanced by around 15-fold while the cor15a level is only enhanced by 2-fold . this discrepancy may be due to that the gt- <dig> protein levels and/or its activities are not elevated in proportion. alternatively, other relevant downstream genes may also be regulated for stress responses.

most trihelix proteins have been identified to localize to the nucleus  <cit> . gt- <dig> has been reported to localize to the nucleus of the onion epidermal cells  <cit> . however, in the present study, it should be mentioned that gt- <dig> not only localize in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm , suggesting that gt- <dig> may have other regulatory roles in the cytoplasm in addition to its function as a transcriptional activator in the nucleus and it needs to be further studied.

through yeast two-hybrid assay, bifc and co-ip, we find that gt- <dig> could interact with tem <dig> and the interaction seems to be mediated by the c-terminal of gt- <dig> . tem <dig> may enhance the activation activity of gt- <dig> via interacting with c-terminus activation domain . it has been reported that arabidopsis gt-3a and gt-3b could form homo or heterodimers, and the dimerization domain seemed to be located at the c-terminus  <cit> . likewise, gt- <dig> can interact with itself that may function as homo-dimer to regulate gene expression. it is possible that gt- <dig> dimerization may facilitate the association of gt- <dig> with tem <dig>  and whether this is the case remains to be further studied. tem <dig> is a member of rave subfamily of ap2-erebp family and play an important role in flower development and mechanical stimuli response  <cit> . members of ap2-erebp family have been shown to be involved in enhancement of salt tolerance  <cit> .

cor15a expression increases in arabidopsis in response to nacl with transcript levels peaking at 6 h and returning to near basal levels within 12 h. the expression levels of cor15a roughly correlate with the survival rates of the double and single mutants after salt treatment . the above results seem to be consistent with the ability of gt- <dig>  tem <dig> or their combination in activation of cor15a promoter activities .

the salt-inductions of cor15a expression in tem <dig> mutant is largely unchanged, suggesting that there is no obvious correlation between cor15a expression and tem <dig> . additionally, overexpression of tem <dig> exerts no influence on pcor15a::luc . however, the double mutant gt-4/tem <dig> show a more severe reduction in cor15a expression and salt tolerance than gt- <dig> single mutant , indicating that, under high-salinity condition, activation of cor15a and promotions of tolerance by elevated gt- <dig> expression partially depend on tem <dig> function and tem <dig> regulate salt stress response through interaction with gt- <dig> on the whole. it is possible that the interaction between gt- <dig> and tem <dig> would enhance the transcriptional activation ability of gt- <dig> and then promote cor15a expressions. this finding raises the possibility that gt- <dig> acts as a transcription activator in cooperation with the tem <dig> under salinity condition and confers stress tolerance. it should be noted that, under normal condition, the cor15a expression levels increase in the gt-4/tem <dig> mutant, probably reflecting a feedback mechanism for maintainment of the normal growth and development.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, we demonstrate that gt- <dig> has important roles in adaptation to salt stress through regulating cor15a. tem <dig>  as a novel gt-4-interacting partner with b <dig> and ap2/erf domains, also participates in salt stress responses via interaction with gt- <dig>  our results reveal mechanisms of gt- <dig> in salt stress tolerance and provide novel gene resources for crop improvement.
