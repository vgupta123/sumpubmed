BACKGROUND
among the different environmental factors, oxygen proves to be a very critical element for the maintenance of cerebral homeostatic conditions  <cit> . it has been established that some vertebrates may tolerate prolonged hypoxia and high temperatures without damaging vital organs such as the brain  <cit> . in this category, aestivating turtles and fish are considered valuable models for clinical studies  <cit> . aestivation is characterized by a consistent metabolic reduction accompanied by a decrease of temperature and a down-regulation of gas exchange and heart rate  <cit> . by surviving in cocoons for long periods, the aestivating lungfish protopterus annectens unlike hibernators is protected against ammonia toxicity during drought periods above all for mud aestivators, which feature low oxygen levels  <cit> . works have shown that the brain is a major target of oxygen depletion, as shown by brief hypoxia conditions reducing atp levels and consequently membrane depolarization leading to neuronal cell death  <cit> .

under these conditions, the opening of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid  receptor channels not only mediates fast excitatory neurotransmission in many synapses  <cit> , but also accelerates hypoxia-dependent death  <cit> . in this case, ca2+ flowing through ampa receptor channels tends to exert a critical role on apoptosis during epilepsy, hypoxia-ischemia and alzheimer disease  <cit> . among the four ampaergic subtypes , those recognized as silent neurons  are able to modulate synaptic strength by being inserted at post-synaptic containing nmda receptor sites and so these subtypes may regulate dendritic morphology and synaptic transmission via phosphorylative processes during development as well as in pathological conditions  <cit> . interestingly under hypoxia conditions, ampa synaptic activities require the functional involvement of some neuroprotective factors, such as heat shock proteins  and hypoxia-inducible factor- <dig> alpha   <cit> . hif-1α is an important transcriptional factor coordinating adaptive responses against hypoxia in mammals  <cit>  and in fish  <cit>  and so by improving animal’s ability to resist to low oxygen conditions, this factor may avoid cellular damages  <cit>  through the recruitment of other neuroprotective factors such as p <dig> and hsps  <cit> . hsps are highly conserved cell proteins responding to stressful conditions, such as heat shock, hypoxia and metabolic abnormalities  <cit> . at the brain level, hsp-dependent changes following oxygen deprivation are tightly correlated to ion channel plasticity of olfactory cortical cells, where these chaperones preserve glutamatergic synaptic transmission  <cit> . from a functional point of view, hif-1α promotes the activation of small hsps such as hsp <dig> during early ischemic insults  <cit>  while other hsps, and precisely hsp <dig>  are strongly associated with long-term plasticity events at the synaptic level  <cit> .

on this basis, it was our intention to identify a temporal relationship of the expression capacity of the silent neurons glur <dig> and/or glur <dig> to that of the activation of hif-1α along with hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> under normoxic and hypoxic aestivating conditions of the lungfish. the selection of this fish as our experimental model is based on its adaptive capacity to oxygen deprivation by entering into a quiescent aestivating state. the identification of glur <dig> and glur <dig> mrna expression patterns overlapping with the above neuroprotective factors might have potential therapeutic application during hypoxia–dependent neurodegenerative disorders, such as ischemia.

RESULTS
glur <dig> and glur2: molecular identification and distribution pattern
in this work, the application of specific primers designed on rat heterologs  permitted us to identify, for the first time, a partial coding sequence of putative glur <dig>  and glur <dig>  of ampa receptor complex along with β-actin  in protopterus annectens. these sequences showed a high nucleotide identity  with not only the corresponding sequences of ampa receptor subtypes of rattus norvegicus  but also with those of fish such as glur <dig> of oreochromis mossambicus   and glur <dig> of carassius auratus  and of danio rerio  . in a first case, a distinct anterior-posterior expression gradient of glur <dig> and glur <dig> mrna levels was detected in the different brain regions of freshwater  lungfish . in particular, anterior brain regions  supplied intermediate  glur <dig> and glur <dig> mrna levels in the lateral septum  and in the dorsal pallium , respectively, while lower expression capacities  for both subtypes characterized other brain regions such as lateral pallium , dorsal portion of medial pallium  and medial subpallium . in posterior regions , high  glur <dig> mrna levels characterized the dorsal part of the hypothalamus  along with intermediate levels being reported for the pars intermedia of reticular nucleus , whereas low od signals were typical of the optic tectum , dorsal thalamus  and corpus cerebelli . interestingly of all the posterior brain areas, this last romboencephalic region was the only site supplying high glur <dig> expression levels.

glur <dig> and glur <dig> mrna levels during normoxic and hypoxic aestivation
the discrimination of glur1/ <dig> expression capacities throughout the various brain regions constituted an essential step towards the recognition of these ampaergic subtypes as major targets of aestivating conditions. qpcr analysis carried out on the whole brain of the different experimental conditions exhibited a very high three-fold  reduction of glur <dig> mrna levels in lungfish maintained under a long normoxic aestivation  with respect to fw, 6dae and 6dmud states, along with moderate  reductions with respect to 6mmud animals . moreover, this latter condition displayed a moderately  significant decrease when it was compared to fw, 6dae and 6dmud states . contextually to this trend, in situ hybridization data  supported a preferential brain regional-dependent down-regulation of glur <dig> mrna expression for lungfish maintained under long normoxic aestivating conditions  with respect to hypoxic 6mmud . in particular a very high reduction of glur <dig> transcripts occurred in mostly diencephalic areas such as hyd of 6mae animals when compared to fw . at the same time, moderate reductions were typical of the ventral part of hypothalamus  and thd in 6mae conditions . during the long hypoxic aestivating state , a moderate down- and up-regulation of glur <dig> levels characterized hyd and thd, respectively, when compared to that of fw conditions. it is worthy to note that when glur <dig> variations were estimated for extra-diencephalic areas, 6mae animals still continued to exhibit a general down-regulatory pattern, even though of moderate entity, as reported in some telencephalic regions such as dp and sm as well as in te . conversely, a moderate increase of glur <dig> transcripts was predominantly typical of ventral telencephalic brain areas, such as sm, when lungfish were maintained under a 6mmud state with respect to fw conditions .

as far as glur <dig> expressing neurons are concerned, they resulted to be active at a rather short aestivating state, thus accounting for up-regulated mrna levels as early as 6 days for both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. indeed, qpcr analysis demonstrated a three-fold  increase of glur <dig> levels in both 6dae and 6dmud conditions with respect to fw and 6mmud animals. the rising trend of glur <dig> continued to be also maintained for 6mae animals whereas in the case of 6mmud animals the expression capacity of this ampaergic subtype was strongly reduced to control values . the transcriptional levels of glur <dig>  resulted to be preferentially concentrated in diencephalic regions of 6mae  with respect to 6mmud animals . indeed, evident up-regulations were reported for thd in 6mae  and 6dae , while a moderate up-regulation appeared to characterize hyd and hyv only following long normoxic conditions . however, hypoxic aestivating states did not appear to promote a clear-cut direction for diencephalic sites on the account of a heterogeneous expression pattern being featured by all conditions especially in the case of moderate increases in thd and hyv of 6dmud state as compared to a moderate down-regulation for hyd of 6mmud conditions . conversely, an up-regulatory type of effect characterized above all extra-diencephalic areas, since aside the moderate down-regulated patterns in dp of 6mmud group with respect to fw state , high glur <dig> mrna levels were instead reported for te and cc of 6dae, 6dmud and 6mae groups along with moderate up-regulations characterized dp of short and long normoxic conditions . in addition, neurons expressing this ampaergic receptor subtype in 6mmud animals appeared to be also typical of mesencephalic areas as shown by a moderate glur <dig> mrna up-regulation in te.

mrna expression of protective factors and tunel reaction during normoxic and hypoxic conditions
in a same manner as for ampa receptor subtypes, even the partial coding sequences for both hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  as well as for hif-1α  in protopterus annectens were obtained by using primers designed on rat  and on zebrafish  heterologs . in protopterus annectens hsp <dig>  partial sequence showed a high nucleotide identity  with the heterologs of rattus norvegicus  and fish thalassoma pavo  and danio rerio ; hsp <dig>  with the heterologs of rattus norvegicus  and salmo salar ; hif-1α  with heterologs of rattus norvegicus  and fish cyprinus carpio  and danio rerio .

subsequently, qpcr and in situ hybridization analyses supplied a differentiated mrna expression pattern of these neuroprotective factors during both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. such protective elements showed a preferential type of activity not only for short hypoxic states  but also for long hypoxic and normoxic states . indeed, hif-1α and hsp <dig> supplied an overlapping expression pattern and precisely a high two-fold  increase being typical of short  and long  conditions with respect to both fw and 6dae groups . at the same time, hif-1α also exhibited a moderate transcriptional increase in 6mae animals with respect to these same conditions. in the case of hsp <dig>  this chaperone appeared to characterize exclusively long aestivating conditions, as demonstrated by two-fold increases in 6mae and 6mmud with respect to all experimental conditions .

from in situ hybridization evaluations, it seemed that the specific distribution pattern of neurons expressing glur <dig> and glur <dig> tightly overlapped those expressing hif-1α and hsp <dig> as well as hsp <dig> under the above aestivating conditions. the different neuronal fields of diencephalic and extra-diencephalic areas turned out to be the main expression sites of hif-1α transcripts during mainly short and long hypoxic conditions, as displayed by very high mrna transcript levels of this transcriptional factor in hyd , dp , te  and cc  along with high levels in thv  and thd  of 6dmud animals with respect to fw state . some of these same brain areas, such as thv, continued to express very high levels of hif-1α mrna  under long hypoxic aestivating condition , along with up-regulations being typical of thd , dp  and te . in the case of normoxic aestivating state, 6mae lungfish appeared to be characterized by significant hif-1α increases  in cc  and thd . at the same time, early hypoxic conditions also accounted for very high hsp <dig> mrna levels in these same brain areas  and namely thv , te , hyd , thd  and dp  along with increases in cerebellar areas . under a long hypoxic state , hsp <dig> turned out to be expressed in a still significant fashion as reported by its high level in thv  and dp , while during the long normoxic aestivation  an evident up-regulation characterized hyd  and thv  and moderate increases were detected in thd  and cc .

as far as mrna levels of hsp <dig>  which has been shown to be indicative of a long-term hypoxia-related protective measure are concerned, this transcript was expressed under prevalently long normoxic and hypoxic aestivating states with respect to other experimental conditions . in situ hybridization data showed that very high expression levels of this protective factor were specific for diencephalic areas , such as thd  and thv  under long normoxic aestivating conditions, with a similar pattern being also obtained for long hypoxic aestivating conditions in thd , thv  and hyd . on the other hand, a significant increase of hsp <dig> was registered for hyd  of 6dmud animals and for thd  of 6dae . in line with this up-regulating trend, the mrna expression pattern of such a protective factor appeared to be also highly increased in dp  and te  during long normoxic aestivating conditions along with a significant increase for cc . similarly, long hypoxic conditions continued to induce a very high up-regulation of hsp <dig> transcripts, this time in dp  and cc , together with increases in te , while the short hypoxic state accounted for significant up-regulation of mrna levels in dp  and te . surprisingly, the expression pattern of this protective factor seemed to overlap apoptotic events in extra-diencephalic brain regions under long aestivation conditions . this was particularly evident for the very great number of tunel positive neurons for the entire tel  and cb  under a long normoxic state , along with a moderate reaction being also detected in te  for this same aestivating state with respect to fw . at the same time, an evident tunel reaction characterized tel  and cb  when lungfishes were exposed to long hypoxic aestivation conditions .

discussion
in this work for the first time, altered transcriptional levels of both ampaergic receptor subtypes mrnas occurring concomitantly to elevated expression levels of selective neuroprotective factors during the different aestivating conditions tend to underlie a distinct protection program operating in a similar fashion to those reported for some ischemic disorders  <cit> . this feature was basically established through the detection of the specific silent neurons expressing glur <dig> and/or glur <dig> mrnas in well-known motor-related brain regions such as cb and te of the lungfish, so suggesting that compensatory pathways under hypoxic conditions might be activated  <cit> . in such a context it appears that the switching over between mrna expression of these two subtypes under either brief or long aestivating states may turn out to be a pivotal condition for the functional recovery of motor activities at arousal, which are controlled by these areas very likely via the action of ampa receptors permeable to ca2+ lacking glur <dig>  <cit> . in addition, these same brain areas featured enhanced expression levels of the neuroprotective factors hif-1α, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  which were comparable to those of other aestivating species such as the turtle trachemys scripta <cit>  and the lizard tupinambis merianae <cit>  that display a notable resistance to not only ammonium toxicity  <cit>  but also to oxidative state deficits  <cit> . in line with this condition, it is very probable that the specific molecular properties of motor brain sites seem to constitute a key target of oxygen-dependent nitrogen metabolism of aestivating species  <cit>  and as a consequence these tend to operate in a very similar manner to hypoxia-related neurodegenerative disorders like alzheimer’s disease in mammals  <cit> .

curiously, both ampa receptor subtypes were not expressed in the same direction especially during reduced oxygen availability of aestivation in mud and this seems to point to the induction of glur1/ <dig> as a key step responsible for the consolidation of silent synaptic processes, at least during sleeping states  <cit> . such a feature was established via the identification of partial nucleotide fragments codifying for both ampa receptor subtypes in protopterus annectens, which subsequently enabled us to display a putative high degree of similarity to that of not only fish but also to those of amphibians  <cit> , birds  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> . indeed, high glur <dig> mrna levels above all in thalamic and mesencephalic regions may constitute ideal situations at least for the maintenance of long sleeping-like states of lungfish, this time not only during normoxic aestivating conditions but above all during early aestivating states. these conditions are very likely due to high glur <dig> mrna levels being tightly related to silent neuron type of events that consist in lysosomial degradative pathways promoting ampa internalization processes  <cit> . hence this phenomenon, like that of nrem in mammals, appears to heavily rely on low glur <dig> levels detected during the long normoxic aestivating conditions, very probably through their inactivation by protein kinase c ii-related processes  <cit> . the fact that both silent subtypes are involved with sleeping events of our lungfish tends to indicate a gradual insertion of ampa receptor-dependent excitatory synaptic functions being essential for numerous neuronal activities such as the ionic channel pharmacological properties of the different vertebrates  <cit>  and above all initial contact-related motor functions that are typical of zebrafish embryos  <cit> .

the results of tunel analysis and the concomitant increased hsp <dig> levels seem to suggest that a specific homeostatic neuronal program involving neurogenesis and apoptotic events are characterizing the different aestivating conditions of protopterus annectens. in particular, specific motor controlling neuronal fields during long aestivating conditions  exhibited dense apoptotic reactions similar to those obtained for other vertebrates such as amphibians  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> . it is thus tempting to propose that the lungfish brain during aestivation executes a precise balance between cell death and neurogenesis especially in those areas, which are required to maintain in equilibrium an accurate number of cells in a regenerative state  <cit> , probably via hsp70-dependent suppression of necrosis and caspase-independent apoptotic pathways  <cit> . interestingly, hsp <dig> has been recognized as a “conformational repair agent” and so its elevated levels during long aestivating states like that of brain hyperthermic stress may prove to be important for correcting stress-induced damage to synaptic proteins and guiding the structural assembly at postsynaptic density  <cit> . moreover, the preservation of neurosignaling activities during long aestivation requires the activation of the pro-survival factor hsp <dig> in motor-related areas similarly to protective mechanisms detected in mammals during cerebral ischemia-dependent disorders  <cit> .

it is worthy to note that during hypoxic aestivating conditions ampa receptor transcriptional levels were increased, as demonstrated by significant mrna levels of glur <dig> and glur <dig> during 6mmud and 6dmud states, respectively. similar receptor variations have been reported during short-term hypoxia for rat hippocampal ampa receptor complex  <cit> , while under prolonged hypoxic conditions an increase of ampa current is not observed, indicating its suppression during prolonged oxygen deprivation. consequently, the increase of the two silent neurons during brief hypoxia may contribute to an early reorganization of synapses, including the promotion of ampa receptor-mediated effects at previously silent synapses and increased synthesis of excitatory receptor subtypes  <cit> . subsequently the blockade of ampaergic currents, through the recruitment of ampa receptors containing glur <dig>  may promote long-term neuronal survival and tolerance to seizure susceptibility in those brain areas of the lungfish linked with the recovery of motor and visual functions at arousal. these plasticity events appear to exhibit a similar trend to that observed in the anoxic turtle brain  <cit> , suggesting that conserved protective systems may be adopted during vertebrate evolution, in order to assure rapid and appropriate responses to various oxygen tensions. the early increase of glur <dig> mrna levels in 6dmud condition, promptly replaced by a reduction of this transcript during 6mmud state, may be considered as a pre-conditioning factor against hypoxia-related events, which appears to strongly require the rapid induction of hif-1α and hsp <dig>  such an activity is in line with recent evidences showing that stress-related proteins may display a different temporal activation during hypoxia, with the protective factor  representing an early switch against hypoxia-related conditions in newborn mammals  <cit> . furthermore, the harsh environmental conditions guiding the lungfish into a hypometabolic state promotes the activation of the early protective factors that causes the arrest of growth/developmental events as well as of apoptotic neuronal processes  <cit> . thus, neuronal death occurring after a short hypoxic aestivation in our lungfish may account for a rapid activation of hif-1α, which in turn promotes the recruitment of inducible hsp <dig>  this small chaperone by activating a protective pathway through the inhibition of both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms  <cit>  prevents neuronal damages against subsequent ischemic insults in a similar manner to that reported for rat retinal ischemia  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
these results underlie the crucial role of the expression of the ampaergic silent neurons  during aestivation of protopterus annectens and highlight new adaptive strategies operating in key brain regions of this lungfish in relation to oxygen availability. during vertebrate evolution, the homoeostatic balance between an active or silent synaptic state resulted to be a determinant factor for the entering into a torpor condition, probably via the regulation of glur <dig> and glur <dig> phosphorylative processes  <cit> . glur <dig> seems to represent an early neuronal marker of cellular oxidative imbalance, a condition by which this ampa receptor subtype concomitantly to hif-1α/hsp <dig> complex elicits long-term protection during aestivation, in a similar fashion to that reported during mammalian ischemic events  <cit> . in particular, long-term expression variations of silent neurons that are tightly related to hsp70-dependent synaptic stabilization may bring us closer to elucidate the type of neuronal mechanism operating during hypoxia-related dysfunctions  <cit> . we are still at the beginning, but the application of pharmacological and molecular approaches for the characterization of distinct ampa receptor membrane domains as well as their interaction with other hypoxia-related factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor  <cit>  may represent a valuable therapeutic tool for hypoxia-related disorders such as ischemia.
