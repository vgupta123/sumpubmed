BACKGROUND
metal-responsive transcription factor  <dig>  can cooperate, in a positive or negative manner, with other transcription factors binding to their own dna sites nearby , but no mtf-1-specific coactivators or corepressors were described so far. a general interaction analysis of drosophila proteins by means of the yeast two-hybrid system  <cit>  revealed two closely related proteins as potential interaction partners of mtf- <dig> . these interaction proteins were encoded by genes designated cg <dig> and cg <dig>  <cit> . both belong to a protein family that is conserved from yeast to humans and whose founding member was described in the nematode c. elegans as dumpy- <dig> , a protein involved in dosage compensation of sex chromosomes  <cit> . dpy- <dig> is required for sex-specific association of dpy- <dig>  a chromosome condensation protein homolog, with the hermaphrodite's x chromosomes. besides causing xx-specific lethality, the dpy- <dig> mutation in xo animals causes developmental delay, small body size, inability to mate and abnormal tail morphology  <cit> . these phenotypes suggest an involvement of dpy- <dig> also in processes other than dosage compensation. the yeast homolog of c. elegans dpy- <dig>  sdc <dig>  was identified as an important component of the eight-member complex , which functions as a histone  <dig> lysine  <dig>  methyltransferase  <cit> . the loss of individual set <dig> protein complex subunits differentially affects set <dig> stability, complex integrity and the distribution of h3k <dig> methylation along active genes. such mutations cause defects in maintenance of telomere length  <cit>  and in dna repair  <cit> . dpy- <dig> and its close relatives contain a short motif related to the dimerization motif in the regulatory subunit of protein kinase a. this motif consists of two α-helices that form a special type of four-helix bundle during dimerization  <cit> . until recently no data were available on one of the drosophila homologs, cg <dig>  while the other, cg <dig>  was shown to be expressed in testes by genome-wide microarray analysis of transcription  <cit> .

as mentioned, the interaction partner of dpy-30-like proteins in the drosophila interaction study was identified as metal-responsive transcription factor  <dig> . mtf- <dig> is a key regulator of heavy metal homeostasis and detoxification in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . in mammals, mtf- <dig> controls a number of genes for metal homeostasis and is also essential for embryonic liver development  <cit> .

mtf- <dig> binds via its zinc fingers to metal-responsive elements  in the promoter/enhancer region of target genes  <cit>  and activates their transcription. metallothioneins are the best characterized target genes of mtf-1; they encode small, cysteine-rich proteins with an ability to scavenge excess heavy metal ions  <cit> . drosophilae mutant for dmtf- <dig>  the homolog of mammalian mtf- <dig>  are viable but more sensitive to elevated concentrations of heavy metals, as well as to copper scarcity  <cit> . upon copper starvation, dmtf- <dig> activates transcription of the gene encoding ctr1b, a high affinity copper importer  <cit> . recently several additional target genes of mtf- <dig> in mammals and in drosophila were identified and characterized in our laboratory by microarray and specific transcript analysis  <cit>  but little is known to date about proteins interacting with and/or regulating drosophila mtf- <dig> function.

here we show that transgenes of both drosophila dpy- <dig> orthologs, cg <dig> and cg <dig>  hereafter termed dpy-30-like  <dig>  and dpy-30-like  <dig> , respectively, inhibit mtf-1-dependent reporter gene expression in cell culture. constitutive expression of a dpy-30l <dig> transgene in flies results in elevated sensitivity to cd and zn, while dpy-30l <dig> overexpression has no such effect. consistent with metal resistance, only the dpy-30l <dig> transgene inhibited dmtf- <dig> activity in flies. gene knockout by homologous recombination revealed that dpy-30l <dig> null mutant flies are viable and fertile and maintain a seemingly normal metal homeostasis, while knockout of the male-specific dpy-30l <dig> results in male sterility. sperm motility in dpy-30l <dig> mutants is impaired and drastically decreases with age. after mating mutant sperm is transferred to the uterus but does not accumulate in the seminal receptacle and spermathecae, making successful fertilization impossible. these findings reveal a major role of dpy- <dig> proteins in male fertility and sperm motility.

RESULTS
inhibition of mtf-1-dependent reporter expression in drosophila schneider s <dig> cells
the drosophila interactome study of giot et al.  <cit>  had revealed three proteins that display very good , good , and weak  interaction with dmtf- <dig>  in order to characterize the role of these proteins in drosophila, especially in the context of metal homeostasis, the open reading frames  of all three were cloned into a drosophila expression vector and analyzed by transfection and co-transfection studies in insect cells. the third protein reported to interact with dmtf- <dig> only weakly, cg <dig>  was listed as a protein putatively involved in golgi organization and biogenesis, mitosis and protein targeting. in our hands it did not affect mtf- <dig> function , thus rendering doubtful a physiological relevance of the predicted interaction.

in drosophila schneider s <dig> cells  <cit> , transfection of dpy-30l <dig> or dpy-30l <dig> inhibited the expression of mtf-1-dependent reporter genes driven either by the promoter of the drosophila metallothionein a   or by a synthetic promoter consisting of four tandem metal response elements , the binding sites of mtf- <dig> . the effect on the synthetic mre promoter was more pronounced, suggesting that dpy-30l <dig> and dpy-30l <dig> indeed interact with dmtf- <dig> and thereby interfere with its activity, as mtf- <dig> is the only factor known to bind mres. this inhibitory effect could also be shown in the whole organism expressing an yfp reporter gene driven by the metallothionein  promoter . here, the response  to copper, and especially to cadmium, was strongly reduced, whereas under copper starvation conditions no difference was observed.

due to the high degree of conservation among all the members of this protein family, we screened the mouse and human genome for the orthologs  and subcloned the dpy-30-like members both from mouse and human. these mammalian dpy-30-like proteins were as effective as the drosophila proteins in repressing dmtf- <dig> activity in drosophila schneider cells . however, it appears that the antagonistic interaction between mtf- <dig> and dpy- <dig> family members is specific to drosophila mtf-1: mammalian mtf- <dig> was not affected by dpy-30-type proteins, irrespective of whether the test was done in drosophila cells  or mammalian cells .

to gain further insights to the inhibitory effect of dpy-30l <dig> on dmtf- <dig>  we did an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  of transfected vsv-tagged mtf- <dig>  without or with co-transfected dpy-30l <dig>  the reduced band intensity of the shifted mre oligo suggests that dpy-30l <dig> interferes with binding of mtf- <dig> to its cognate mre dna .

flies overexpressing dpy-30l <dig> are sensitive to heavy metal load
we generated transgenic flies with ubiquitous, constitutive expression of dpy-30l <dig> or dpy-30l <dig>  taking advantage of the uas-gal <dig> system whereby gal <dig> was driven by the drosophila actin promoter. flies overexpressing dpy-30l <dig> were raised during their entire development on normal food, or food supplemented with different heavy metals. they did not show a phenotype when kept on standard food but were much more sensitive to heavy metal load, especially to cadmium and zinc, while sensitivity to copper was only marginally affected . the sensitivity to cadmium and zinc could be rescued by co-overexpression of an mtf- <dig> transgene . this shows that the metal sensitivity of organisms expressing transgenic dpy-30l <dig> was not merely reflecting a generally lower resistance to stress but rather a disturbed metal-specific stress response. this point was corroborated by raising flies in excess iron, a metal that is handled by a pathway different from the mtf-1/metallothionein system. neither an increased sensitivity nor a rescue effect could be observed upon overexpression of dpy-30l <dig> and/or dmtf- <dig> . although both dpy-30l <dig> and dpy-30l <dig> overexpression inhibited mtf- <dig> function in cell culture, only dpy-30l <dig> was effective in a transgenic fly. this leads to the conclusion that there are functional differences between the two related proteins that become evident only in whole-organism studies.

expression pattern of dpy-30l <dig> and dpy-30l2
to determine the expression pattern of both genes in larvae and adult flies, transgenes were constructed where a fluorescent reporter  was under the control of approximately  <dig> kb of genomic region from dpy-30l <dig> or dpy-30l <dig>  the expression pattern of the two genes was quite distinct: the dpy-30l <dig> regulatory region induced expression in multiple larval tissues, notably brain, gonads, imaginal discs and salivary glands. in adult flies, expression was seen in the brain, testes, ovaries and salivary glands. in contrast, the expression of dpy-30l2-yfp was confined exclusively to male gonads in larvae, and to the testes in adult flies. further dissection of the expression pattern of dpy-30l2-yfp during spermatogenesis revealed that dpy-30l2-yfp is expressed in elongated spermatids at the "canoe-like" stage but not during the early stages of spermatogenesis or in mature sperm , which is also consistent with the online drosophila testis gene expression database  <cit> . the expression pattern of these transgenic constructs was very similar to the ones derived from a genome-wide transcription map recently published online in flyatlas  <cit> .

targeted gene disruption shows that dpy-30l <dig> is essential for male fertility
in order to determine the in vivo role of the two dpy-30-like proteins, we disrupted both of the corresponding genes by means of homologous recombination  <cit> . somewhat unexpectedly, dpy-30l <dig> knockout flies turned out to be viable and fertile under laboratory conditions and did not show any obvious alterations in metal resistance/sensitivity phenotypes . in the mutated locus, the yellow fluorescent protein  and sv <dig> polyadenylation/termination sequence was followed, out-of-frame, by a truncated dpy-30l <dig> coding sequence . though unlikely, we cannot rule out the possibility that the residual dpy-30l <dig> sequence was expressed by re-initiation of transcription and translation from an internal site in the coding region, thus producing a hypomorph, rather than a null mutation. in contrast, disruption of the male-specific dpy-30l <dig> gene resulted in complete male sterility. combination of the two mutations did not reveal any additional phenotypic features, i.e., male flies were again sterile but otherwise normal under laboratory conditions.

we attempted to identify more precisely the defects in the reproductive system of dpy-30l <dig> knockout males. a dissection of dpy-30l26- <dig> males revealed apparently normal testes that contained sperm. in the nematode c. elegans, dpy- <dig> is known to be involved in dosage compensation, a process that equalizes the expression of x-chromosomes in xx and xo animals  <cit> , and in yeast it methylates histones  <cit> . dpy-30l <dig> is specifically expressed in the spermatid stage where transcription is repressed in germ cells and histones are removed from dna to be replaced by protamines. thus we wondered whether in drosophila, loss of dpy-30l <dig> distorts chromatin structure at this critical stage. however, loss of histone h2a variant d  expression, a hallmark of the transition to the protamine-loaded sperm, was not affected , and also the protamine b-egfp distribution pattern was not disturbed. furthermore, the marker mst77f-egfp was inconspicuous in that it was associated with dna at the appropriate stage of spermatogenesis . mst77f is a distant relative of the linker histone h1/h <dig> family and has been proposed to support the transition to compact drosophila sperm chromatin  <cit> . unlike its mammalian homolog , drosophila mst77f persists in mature sperm nuclei  <cit> .

however, we found one clear difference between mutant and wild type flies: dissection of the reproductive tract of females that had mated with dpy-30l <dig> mutant males revealed that sperm were confined to the uterus, which means that they had failed to be transmitted to the seminal receptacle and the spermathecae . since from these latter sites sperm are used to fertilize eggs, this mislocalization could, in part or completely, explain the sterility of mutant males. a possible reason for mislocalization of dpy-30l <dig> mutant sperm in females could be impaired or uncoordinated motility of sperm. dissection of the reproductive tract of females that had been mated either with oregon r or with dpy-30l26- <dig> males showed that dpy-30l <dig> knockout sperm indeed lose their motility after transfer to the female reproductive tract . more detailed analysis of sperm amount and motility in males revealed an age-dependent decrease in both amount and motility of dpy-30l26- <dig> sperm, with complete loss of motility in 20-day-old males in contrast to heterozygous males. taken together, these results reveal that dpy-30l <dig> is important for sperm production and motility.

xy hs-tra* – xy fly carrying a single copy of the hs-tra-female plasmid  <cit> . these flies are females, which contain no eggs, but rather small nonfunctional germ cells in their gonads. as no eggs are laid, sperm can be detected in the uterus or in oviducts long after mating. the experiment shows that mutant sperm is not stored in the seminal receptacle and that it is immotile when remaining in the uterus or in the oviduct. in contrast, motile wildtype sperm is found both in seminal receptacles and in the uterus or oviducts of the analyzed females.

discussion
in transfected cells, both of the dpy- <dig> orthologs of drosophila, termed dpy-30l <dig> and dpy-30l <dig> , inhibit the activity of mtf- <dig> , while in transgenic flies, such an effect was only seen with the stronger interactor dpy-30l <dig>  consistent with such an inhibition, transgenic flies were sensitive to cadmium or zinc load, while copper sensitivity was only marginally affected. the increased metal sensitivity could be rescued by co-overexpression of dmtf- <dig>  an emsa assay revealed a weakened binding of mtf- <dig> to mre dna in the presence of dpy-30l <dig>  taken together, these results suggest that for detoxification of cd or zn a higher level of mtf- <dig> is required than for cu detoxification. studies with partial inactivation mutants of dmtf- <dig> are in agreement with such a notion . unexpectedly, only mtf- <dig> of insect origin responded to dpy- <dig> type proteins: while the human and mouse dpy- <dig> members also inhibited drosophila mtf- <dig> across species boundaries, activity of human mtf- <dig> was unchanged in the presence of either drosophila or mammalian dpy- <dig> members. this indicates some degree of functional divergence between drosophila and mammalian mtf- <dig> during evolution, in spite of a conserved role in heavy metal homeostasis and detoxification. we consider the dpy-30-dmtf- <dig> interactions observed in the interactome study  <cit>  relevant because  the two major interactors dpy-30l <dig> and l <dig> are members of the same protein family;  a  functional interaction with dmtf- <dig> was seen with both of them, and with their mammalian dpy- <dig> homolog, in transfected cells;  dpy-30l <dig>  the stronger interactor, also produced an effect in vivo, and  it inhibited the binding of dmtf- <dig> to its cognate dna sequence.

as a complement to transgenic expression of dpy-30l <dig> and dpy-30l <dig>  we also tested a loss of function of the two proteins. disruption of short genes in drosophila has been a great challenge since small targets are rarely hit by random mutagenesis. to circumvent this problem, we eliminated dpy-30l <dig> and l <dig> function separately by homologous recombination  <cit> . somewhat unexpectedly, knockout of neither dpy-30l <dig> nor dpy-30l <dig> affected metal handling under the conditions tested, but dpy-30l <dig> which is specifically expressed in male gonads, turned out to be essential for male fertility.

sdc <dig>  the yeast homolog of dpy- <dig>  is a component of set1c, also called compass . set1c methylates histone h <dig> at lysine residue  <dig>  <cit> . yeast strains mutant for set <dig>  although viable, display defects in cell growth, rdna silencing  <cit> , and silencing of telomeres and mating type loci  <cit> . in c. elegans, the dosage compensation complex , which among other proteins includes dpy- <dig>  represses x-chromosomal transcription in cells of xx animals. the complex binds preferentially to promoter regions and seems to be required for the early steps of dosage compensation, not for its maintenance  <cit> . the set1c complex has also been shown to activate some specific genes, notably for dna repair genes. this activation is however an indirect one, via repression of a signaling cascade  <cit> . direct activation of target genes is also possible, at least in mammals: a human homolog of set1c, the mll  complex which also has methyltransferase activity and is ivolved in tumor cell proliferation  <cit> , positively regulates hox gene expression through binding to promoter sequences  <cit> . recent investigations have shown that the human mll2/alr complex contains the human ortholog of dpy- <dig>  <cit> . taken together, these data indicate a conserved role of dpy- <dig> family members in the modulation of chromatin structure and transcription.

however, there are clear differences as well. the drosophila trithorax complex, the homolog of yeast set1c, is essential for viability. our findings suggest that flies lacking both dpy-30l <dig> and dpy-30l <dig> are viable and that dpy- <dig> orthologs of drosophila are not obligatory components of the trithorax complex. the only mutant phenotype we observed was male sterility in the absence of dpy-30l <dig>  a hallmark of spermatogenesis, the replacement of histones by protamines  <cit>  is not affected in the dpy-30l <dig> mutant. because transcriptional silencing of the spermatid genome seems to occur independently of protamines  <cit> , it appears still possible that dpy-30l <dig> is required for proper gene silencing during spermatogenesis.

in yeast, c. elegans and drosophila, dpy- <dig> members serve different but important functions, perhaps converging, in metazoans, on sex-specific gene expression programs, compatible with the fact that the single dpy- <dig> ortholog of the mouse is strongly expressed in testes.

CONCLUSIONS
dumpy- <dig>  type proteins are conserved from yeast to humans but their function in higher eukaryotes is only partially understood. here we have characterized the two dpy- <dig> familiy members in drosophila. strong expression of dpy-30l <dig> can inhibit the activity of mtf- <dig> , resulting in elevated sensitivity of flies to cadmium and zinc load. the second member, dpy-30l <dig>  is only expressed in the male genital tract; targeted gene disruption of dpy-30l <dig> results in male sterility associated with reduced motility of sperm and failure to be transferred to the female's seminal receptacles. like drosophila dpy-30l <dig>  the mouse dpy- <dig> homolog is strongly expressed in testes, from where the expressed sequence tag  was obtained  <cit> . thus dpy- <dig> family members may well be required for male fertility also in mammals.
