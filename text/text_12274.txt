BACKGROUND
newly discovered players in the antiviral immunity field are the proteins belonging to the tripartite motif  family. the trim proteins are characterized by a tripartite motif that comprises from the n- to c-terminus, a ring zinc finger domain, one or two b-boxes and a coiled-coil domain. they are therefore also known as rbcc proteins  <cit> . the ring finger and b-box are cysteine-rich domains and both domains bind zinc atoms, suggesting interaction with other proteins, rna and dna  <cit> . they are usually encoded as a single exon, and together form the 'rbb' region. in addition, the ring finger has e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity  <cit> . the coiled-coil region seems to be predominantly necessary for multimerization, resulting in the formation of high-molecular weight complexes. in many trim proteins an additional domain is present at the c-terminus  <cit> , with the b <dig>  domain being the most frequent one . the b <dig>  domain is encoded by one exon  <cit> . the domain is also found in butyrophilin and stonustoxin  <cit>  and has evolved by a relatively recent juxtaposition of the pry domain and the spry domain; it is therefore also known as the pry/spry domain  <cit> . the b <dig>  domain has been shown to be essential for ligand binding in several trim proteins  <cit> . its tertiary structure has recently been elucidated for trim <dig>  revealing two binding pockets formed by six variable loops  <cit> . since the order and spacing of the domains are highly conserved, a trim protein presumably acts as an integrated structure  <cit> . trim proteins are evolutionarily old proteins that can be found in primitive metazoans  <cit> . currently,  <dig> trim-encoding genes have been described in human  <cit> . most trim genes code for at least two isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing, resulting in full-length and partial transcripts that lack the c-terminal encoding sequence.

the trim proteins play multiple roles in various cellular processes, which include cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis in mammals. many trim genes are proto-oncogenes and severe diseases such as opitz syndrome and acute promyelocytic leukemia are caused by mutations in trim <dig> and trim <dig>  respectively  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> . an antiviral activity has also been described for several trim proteins: trim <dig>  -5α, - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> - <dig>  <cit> . these trim proteins can block viral infection by different mechanisms, as revealed by the functional characterization of trim5α, trim <dig> and trim <dig>  a virus-specific interaction has been described for trim5α and trim <dig>  trim5α was initially identified in rhesus macaques as the protein responsible for post-entry restriction of hiv- <dig> in this species, while its human ortholog could not block hiv- <dig>  <cit> . trim5α forms trimers that bind the nucleocapsid of incoming viral particles through a c-terminal b <dig>  domain, which accelerates the uncoating of the viral core and thereby interferes with the reverse transcription  <cit> . among primates, this domain contains four hypervariable regions that have been subjected to a virus-driven diversification and account for the species-dependent retrovirus restriction of trim5α  <cit> . the ring and b-box domains of trim5α are essential for localizing trim5α in specific cytoplasmic 'bodies' and may also be involved in inhibiting the assembly of progeny virions  <cit> . the antiviral restriction activity of trim <dig>  or promyelocytic leukemia  protein has been demonstrated for retroviruses , but also for an arenavirus , a rhabdovirus  and an orthomyxovirus   <cit> . for example, trim19/pml binds the hfv tas protein, a transactivator for hfv transcription, preventing binding of tas protein to the viral genome and thereby transcription of viral open-reading frames   <cit> . as expected for proteins involved in antiviral defenses, several trim proteins are induced by interferon  <cit> , but they can also participate in the induction of interferon synthesis. thus, trim <dig> is involved in the production of ifn-β through the rig1-pathway  <cit> .

here, we characterize a new subset of trim genes that were originally discovered in a screen for virus-induced genes expressed by fish  <cit> , and named them fintrim for fish novel trim. the fintrim genes constitute a unique expansion of trim genes in different teleost species, with up to  <dig> genes identified in zebrafish . in the zebrafish, these genes are located on several chromosomes, with three main clusters on the chromosome  <dig>  the orfs of this multigene family are highly similar in sequence, but variable in length. the most extended proteins contain a ring finger, two b-boxes, a coiled-coil region and a b <dig>  domain. interestingly, the fintrim b <dig>  domains have evolved under diversifying selection, and are closely related to b <dig>  domains present in a nod-like receptor  subfamily unique to teleost fish  <cit> . the characterization of the fintrim subset highlights the evolutionary dynamics of the trim family and strongly advocates a role in the innate antiviral response of fish.

RESULTS
fintrim, a new group of trim proteins induced by viruses in rainbow trout
in order to identify virus-induced transcripts in fish leukocytes, we previously used the method of subtractive suppressive hybridization on rainbow trout leukocytes that were either incubated with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus  or mock-infected. this approach identified  <dig> virus-induced sequences  <cit> . one of them  contained a  <dig> aa orf with a ring finger and two b-box motifs, resulting in a rbb domain typical of trim proteins. no coiled-coil region could be found in this sequence. a naive trout spleen cdna library was then screened to confirm the structure of this trim cdna and we identified two other full-length sequences . these sequences contained a rbb region almost identical to that of the af <dig> clone , associated with a coiled-coil region. in addition, the clone am <dig> contained a c-terminal b <dig>  domain . a multiple alignment of these sequences suggested that they did not result from alternative splicing of the same gene. taken together, these results already suggested that these trims belong to a multigenic family with a modular structure. we could not find any obvious counterpart of these trims in sequence databases from mammals or other tetrapods. we thus assumed that they may belong to a new subfamily, and named them fintrims.

the induction of fintrim transcripts by the virus was further confirmed using real-time quantitative pcr  using primers b144f/r located in the rbb region and matching the three clones . the induction ratio measured by this real-time pcr therefore corresponded to an average value, and may conceal disparities of the induction level for different genes. an induction ratio higher than  <dig> was measured after the viral infection in leukocytes or poly treatment in fibroblasts, while no induction was noted in leukocytes after incubation with lipopolysaccharide  from e. coli. in lps-treated leukocytes, ifnγ transcript was induced 7-fold , demonstrating an effective stimulation. these experiments established that at least some fintrims are induced by viral infection.

to characterize further the diversity of the fintrims, we performed a 3'race pcr on vhsv-induced leukocyte cdna using a universal primer specific for trout fintrim localized in the highly conserved region in the vicinity of the start codon. these experiments on infected leukocytes revealed a rich profile of amplified bands, which suggested that fintrim sequences are highly diverse . a diverse profile was also observed in the absence of infection, but the signal appeared weaker and the profile less complex. to investigate fintrim expression in a non-lymphoid cell type, similar 3'race pcr experiments were performed on the fibroblast cell line rtg <dig>  poly was used to mimic viral infection, since vhsv replicates in these cells and kills them quickly, in contrast to leukocytes. almost no expression of fintrims could be detected in untreated fibroblasts, while a number of bands appeared after poly stimulation . this profile was less diverse than in leukocytes, with a bias towards long transcripts. this observation indicated that different arrays of fintrims are expressed in different cells, and corroborated the notion that some forms are inducible by viral infection.

the rainbow trout fintrim transcripts are highly diverse
to further characterize the fintrim diversity and to assess the specificity of the 3'race pcr amplification, we cloned the pcr products and sequenced clones picked at random. fifty-four clones from leukocytes and  <dig> clones from rtg <dig> cells were completely sequenced. all clones contained a fintrim sequence, confirming the high specificity of the amplification. the size of fintrim transcripts was highly diverse, as expected from the 3'race profile. different c-terminal regions of variable length were associated with the n-terminal rbb region shared by all sequences. for some clones, the c-terminus was encoded by short unique sequences unrelated to the longer ones. based on their length or on the motifs present in the c-terminus, we classified the deduced fintrim proteins into five different groups . in fact, although the n-terminal ring/b-box regions of the different fintrim sequences were highly similar to each other, they were not identical due to single nucleotide substitutions. these substitutions were more frequent than the error frequency due to pcr and sequencing , and most of them were restricted to a number of conserved sites, which indicates that they did not correspond to artifacts. therefore, the fintrim diversity could not be due to alternative splicing of a unique rbb exon to multiple and diverse c-terminal exons. moreover, the different sequences from leukocyte cdnas were derived from a homozygous rainbow trout , and therefore represent many different genes and not allelic diversity. taken together, these observations suggest that rainbow trout fintrims are encoded by a large number of different genes.

the fintrim genes are highly diverse in zebrafish where they constitute a multigenic family
in order to extend the generality of our findings, we searched for fintrim genes in another teleost, the zebrafish danio rerio. tblastn searches were made on the most recent zebrafish genome assembly , using as query the trout protein sequence af <dig> containing a ring and two b-box motifs. a set of more than  <dig> significant hits was obtained. more than half of them, associated with the most significant e values, were more similar to the trout fintrims than to any other described trim gene. unexpectedly, among low-ranking hits, we also found many genes with sequences most similar to bloodthirsty , a known zebrafish trim gene with a b <dig>  domain, involved in erythrocyte differentiation and closely related to human trim <dig>  <cit> . this observation was in accordance with a recent survey of vertebrate trim sequences reporting a high diversity of trim sequences in the fish genome  <cit> .

as a consequence of our search criteria, all these hits corresponded to n-terminal rbb exons . we extended our search by looking for b <dig>  domain-encoding exons in the downstream genomic sequence and found one in most cases . several genes appeared to be likely pseudogenes, either because of early frameshifts , or absence of an identifiable start or stop codon. however, in several instances this may be due to a genome assembly defect or to unusual gene structure with extra undetected exon upstream of the rbb or downstream of the b <dig> . the deduced protein sequences were aligned and similarity trees were established . the trees obtained with the rbb domains and with the b <dig>  domains were highly congruent and allowed us to define two families: one that contained  <dig> fintrim genes  and one that contained  <dig> bloodthirsty-related genes . three subgroups, based on apparent phylogenetic age, were defined among the fintrim family. the major subgroup , which includes  <dig> genes , represents the 'crown group', which appears to have evolved most recently. group b, including  <dig> genes  is not monophyletic, and contains genes that appear to have diverged at around the time that the clade that now includes the zebrafish separated from the main teleost lineage. finally, group c consists of only three genes , which seem to be the most ancient ones. within each subgroup, genes were named according to their genomic position. because the zebrafish genome assembly zv <dig> is still imperfect, a few difficulties appeared with the annotation. for instance, the bty gene itself was not found in zv <dig> . an inverted duplication on chromosome  <dig> results in the presence of twins  for the closely linked ftr <dig> and ftr <dig> genes, which we named ftr58dupli and ftr59dupli. an assembly gap just downstream of the ftr <dig> gene is probably responsible for its lack of a b <dig> -containing exon. finally, contigs containing four genes  are not yet assigned to a given chromosome.

the genomic distribution of all ftr and btr genes is shown in figure 2: detailed positions are given in additional file  <dig> – table s <dig>  as can be readily observed, most of these genes are arranged in clusters of genes in the same orientation. half of the ftr genes are localized on chromosome  <dig>  with three major clusters. phylogenetic analysis indicates that genes within a cluster are more related to each other than to genes in other clusters.

in addition to the long and readily detectable exons encoding the n-terminal rbb and c-terminal b <dig>  domains, middle exons could be predicted for the majority of genes, with the help of our subsequent race analysis  and with gnomon-predicted sequences deposited in genbank. for ftr genes, organization was very well conserved, with a first rbb-encoding exon of  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, two  <dig> and 234-bp long exons encoding the coiled-coils, two  <dig> and 60-bp long exons with no clear domain associated, and a final ~ <dig> coding bp exon encoding the b <dig>  domain.

to gain an insight into the expression pattern of zebrafish fintrim genes, we designed consensus primers to perform 3'race-pcr simultaneously on all members of group a, the largest but also most homogeneous group. race-pcr products from zebrafish larvae were cloned and more than  <dig> clones were sequenced to obtain an approximate image of the relative fintrim expression in different settings of virus-induced activation. we tested three different stimuli: ifn <dig> over-expression, and experimental infection with either spring viremia of carp virus  or a heat-adapted variant of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus . results are summarized in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  given the very high number of zebrafish ftr genes in group a, it would be difficult to get a statistically significant picture of the expression of any single gene, but the aggregated data reveal interesting trends. at the developmental stage examined , expression was restricted, or at least highly skewed, towards a subset of genes, most of them on chromosome  <dig>  genes frequently found in control samples were also expressed in stimulated samples. some genes, such as ftr <dig>  ftr <dig> and ftr <dig>  were detected only in stimulated samples. short and long fintrim proteins were expressed with or without b <dig>  domain, in a striking parallel to what we have found in the trout. viral or ifn-stimulation did not affect the overall pattern of length distribution, perhaps because rna was extracted from whole larvae, which may dilute the specific response. remarkably, alternative splicing did not account for all the diversity in protein size; allelic variation also played a prominent role . for instance, two different groups of ftr <dig> transcripts were found, some coding for canonical, full-length fintrim proteins, while others, similar in this respect to the allele of the zv <dig> genome assembly, contain a  <dig> bp-deletion in the first exon, resulting in a transcript coding for a truncated protein with only a ring domain, irrespective of subsequent splicing.

group a fintrim genes expressed in zebrafish embryos, as deduced from 3'race. control embryos were either  <dig> hpf non-manipulated embryos ;  <dig> hpf, mcherry-transduced embryos ;  <dig> hpf non-manipulated embryos  or  <dig> hpf non-manipulated embryos . stimulated embryos were either  <dig> hpf, zifn1-transduced embryos ;  <dig> hpf, svcv-infected embryos ; or  <dig> hpf, ihnv-infected embryos . multiple occurrences of ftr in different classes correspond either to allelic  or to splicing variants. protein isoforms were classified according to figure  <dig>  accession numbers .

the fintrim family is present in many teleost fish but shows various levels of diversity
systematic searches were performed in other available fish genome databases: medaka , stickleback  and pufferfish , with tblastn and blastp using the trout and zebrafish conserved n-terminus of fintrim as bait . when highly similar hits were found, other fintrim exons were searched close by, and the predicted sequences were subjected to multiple alignment with trout and zebrafish fintrims . we checked that these sequences retrieved zebrafish fintrims or allies when used as a query in the reciprocal blast searches. in medaka, this approach revealed a large number of close fintrim homologs, as in zebrafish. the significant hits are mainly clustered on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . a few genes are also dispersed on other chromosomes . in addition,  <dig> hits were found which were unanchored to the assembly. interestingly, the whole orf is encoded by one exon for most of these hits , in contrast to the zebrafish. these intronless genes correspond most probably to retrotransposed genes.

in the pufferfish, the best hit is localized on chromosome  <dig>  and additional homologs are found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , or among the unanchored sequences.

in the stickleback genome, at least four genes located in the same region of linkage group  iii and three genes in lg vii showed high similarity with trout and zebrafish fintrims. a fintrim-encoding est  was also identified in the channel catfish. taken together, these observations suggested that fintrim genes constitute a multigenic family in all teleost genomes, with a highly variable number of genes .

the fintrims do not possess obvious orthologs in higher vertebrates
we used fish sequences of fintrim rbb or b <dig>  domains with the tblastn program to search for their mammalian homologs in genbank or genome databases. both rbb and b <dig>  regions from fintrim sequences and the related sequences found in tetrapods were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis using nj or parsimony methods, which produced congruent phylogenetic trees. this analysis revealed that the fintrims do not possess direct orthologs in mammals or in other tetrapods . the mammalian proteins most similar to fintrims were trim <dig> and trim <dig>  however, reciprocal blast queries, using mammalian trim <dig> sequences, identified in the zebrafish genome one single gene  more similar to trim <dig> than to fintrims; a relative of this gene was also identified in trout and salmon. similar queries with mammalian trim <dig> retrieved yet another gene . in contrast, no mammalian sequence appeared as a fintrim ortholog. orthologs of fintrims could not be found in chicken or xenopus either, and therefore seem to be absent from tetrapods.

the phylogenetic analysis showed that fintrims sequences from different teleosts grouped in a separate branch supported by high bootstrap values in phylogenetic trees generated by either neighbor-joining  or parsimony methods for both rbb and b <dig>  regions . fintrims therefore appear as a teleost-specific subset. in contrast, trim16-like and trim25-like sequences from fish or clawed frog grouped with their mammalian counterparts, identifying these trim genes as fish orthologs of mammalian trim <dig> and trim <dig>  interestingly, in the elephant shark genome, no fintrim counterpart could be found, while sequences highly similar to trim <dig> and  <dig> were present . although this database is still incomplete and shark trim16/25-related sequences were partial, these observations reinforce the notion that trim <dig> and trim <dig> are ancient genes while fintrims appeared and expanded in the teleost fish.

in addition, since bty has been described as the counterpart of trim <dig>  we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of the btr subgroup and tetrapod trim <dig> with trim <dig>  trim <dig> and fintrims. members of the btr subfamily  were indeed most similar to tetrapod trim <dig>  and reciprocally; they also clustered together in the b <dig> -based tree .

conserved syntenies between teleost fish and tetrapods for fintrim-related genes
to further investigate the origin of fintrims, conserved markers in the vicinity of tetraodon, stickleback or zebrafish ftr clusters were identified and used to search for conserved syntenies in other genomes. no clear conserved synteny could be identified between the regions encoding group a or group b fintrims in different teleosts, suggesting that fintrim genes were subjected to genus or species-specific duplication and expansion episodes during the evolution of teleosts.

in contrast, we could identify a conserved synteny between regions comprising the 'ancient'  ftr <dig> and ftr <dig> genes associated with the markers ints <dig>  rsps <dig>  atp5l, ruvbl <dig> and spsn <dig> in zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback . conserved syntenies were also observed for markers flanking trim <dig> and trim <dig> in these three species, supporting the hypothesis that these genes are older and kept in a more stable genomic configuration than recent fintrims.

interestingly, the orthologs of all the markers involved in these conserved synteny groups  in teleosts were located on the same human chromosome  <dig>  distributed over  <dig> megabases . in addition, they were also retrieved on mouse chromosome  <dig> and on the chicken mini chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> that correspond to large regions of the human chromosome  <dig> 

taken together, these observations in teleosts and tetrapods suggest that the genomic configuration of trim <dig> or trim <dig>  cannot be explained by recent sporadic events that occurred in particular species. they rather suggest that the regions containing the ancestral trim <dig> and trim <dig> moved apart in the early fish evolution and were kept as synteny groups on two different chromosomes while most fintrims appeared and differentiated by multiple duplications in the fish lineages. the situation is more complex for group c ftrs 82/ <dig> .

the zebrafish fintrim proteins have evolved under positive selection
to gain further insight into the meaning of fintrim sequence variability, we analyzed the pattern of variable positions, in the context of the tertiary structure of the b <dig>  domain that has been determined for human trim <dig>  <cit> . the b <dig>  domain forms a distorted β-sandwich of two antiparallel β-sheets, made up by the pry and spry subdomains  <cit> . the β-strands are connected by six variable loops that define regions of hypervariability and form the ligand-binding surface in trim5α and trim <dig>  we determined variability in fintrim b <dig>  by performing two multiple alignments of both trout fintrim b <dig>  and zebrafish fintrim group a b <dig>  sequences  and determined site-by-site variation. we then aligned the b <dig>  domains of trout and zebrafish fintrim with human trim5α and trim <dig> . the trout fintrim b <dig>  sequences are rather conserved and the majority of variable sites,  <dig> of  <dig>  are located in the regions that correspond with the variable loops of trim <dig>  fifteen variable sites of trout correspond with regions that are hypervariable in primate trim5α. the zebrafish fintrim b <dig>  sequences are even less conserved with  <dig> variable sites that are also associated with the predicted variable loops of trim <dig> or with the hypervariable regions of trim5α, albeit more loosely.

for primate trim5α it has been demonstrated that the b <dig>  domain has evolved under diversifying selection pressure, with the positively selected sites predominantly located in the four regions that are hypervariable among primate trim5α  <cit> . we investigated whether the zebrafish fintrim genes have also evolved under diversifying selection. we used a test that is based on the estimation of synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution rates of all codons among a set of sequences. the ratio ω = dn/ds is an indication for negative selection , neutral evolution , or positive selection . if an amino acid change is neutral, it will be fixed at the same rate as a synonymous mutation, and ω =  <dig>  if the amino acid change is deleterious, purifying  selection will reduce its fixation rate, thus ω <  <dig>  an amino acid change is fixed at a higher rate than a synonymous mutation  only when it offers a selective advantage. the site-specific model within the phylogeny analysis by maximum likelihood  software package allows heterogeneity in evolutionary pressure along a protein encoding sequence and can identify the specific sites that are under positive selection. two models of substitution distribution, m2a and m <dig>  can be used to test the positive selection hypothesis against the nested null models: m2a against m1a and m <dig> against m <dig> 

we took the complete sequences of zebrafish fintrim group a b <dig>  domains and analyzed them with the paml models m1a, m2a, m <dig> and m <dig>  a value of ω > <dig> was detected for  <dig> % of sites under m2a and  <dig> % of sites under m <dig> . the likelihood-ratio test  was significant with p <  <dig>  for both models . the estimation of substitution rates by paml is based on branch lengths of sequences in the phylogenetic tree. as a result of recombination, sites within one sequence are no longer similar in branch length and this can interfere with the results of paml since this model assumes that all sites within a sequence are similar in branch length. to investigate whether the detection of positive selection was not perturbed by recombination, we implemented the algorithm parris on our dataset. with the parris program, a partitioning approach is used and site-to-site variation in both synonymous and non-synonymous rates is integrated in the m1a and m2a models. we analyzed the zebrafish fintrim group a b <dig>  sequences with parris and could still detect positive selection by the ltr with p <  <dig> , indicating that whether or not recombination did occur, the b <dig>  has evolved under positive selection. to search for recombination sites, we employed the program gard. the algorithm subdivides the sequence alignment in putative non-recombinant fragments, phylogenies are inferred for each fragment and the goodness of fit is assessed by akaike's information criterium , predicting whether or not the fragments are derived from two different ancestor sequences due to recombination. we searched for either two or up to  <dig> breakage points and could identify one breakage point by both searches, with Δc-aic =  <dig>  under the two-breakage-point model and Δc-aic =  <dig>  under the 20-breakage-point model .

 <dig> for sequence fragments, the numbers correspond with the position of first and last nucleotides in the alignment with excluded gaps.

 <dig> n, the number of sequences in the alignment and tree.

 <dig> c, the number of codons.

 <dig> parameters determined under m2a with ω the ratio of non-synonymous rates  and synonymous rates  and p the corresponding proportion of sites for each ω-class.

 <dig> parameters determined under m <dig> with ω the ratio dn/ds, the corresponding proportion  of sites and p- and q-estimates in the β -distribution.

 <dig> for fragmented regions, numbers correspond with positions of first and last nucleotides in the alignment.

 <dig> the models m1a, m2a, m <dig> and m <dig> were employed, using either the program paml or program parris.

we re-analyzed our zebrafish fintrim group a dataset of b <dig>  by subdividing the alignment in two parts, containing the sequence regions before or after the detected recombination point. for both regions, we detected positive selection, with p <  <dig>  in the lrt under m1a-m2a and m7–m <dig> models . the specific sites under positive selection according to the models 2a and  <dig> were identified by a bayesian approach. for the b <dig>  domain we were able to identify  <dig> sites under both model 2a and  <dig> under model  <dig>  fourteen sites were located in regions corresponding to the predicted variable loops of trim <dig>  in addition, the majority of the sites were located within the regions corresponding with the four hypervariable regions described for trim5α, with six sites falling in the hypervariable region  <dig>  one in region  <dig> and six in region  <dig>  .

we used a similar approach to detect positive selective sites in the ring and two b-box domains. first we analyzed with paml the complete dataset from all ring-b-box sequences from zebrafish fintrim group a. positive selection was detected for  <dig> % of sites under m2a and  <dig> % of sites under m <dig> with p <  <dig>  in the ltr of both m1a-m2a and m7–m <dig>  with parris we confirmed that the rbb has evolved under positive selection with p <  <dig>  in the ltr of m1a-m2a. we used gard to search for recombination and we also identified a breakage point, with a significant value of Δc-aic =  <dig>  under the two-breakage-point model and Δc-aic =  <dig>  under the 20-breakage-point model. we therefore divided the rbb multiple alignment into two segments and re-analyzed the sequences located before and after the breakage site using paml. for the sequences located before the predicted breakage point we found three sites under positive selection under m2a and under m <dig>  with p <  <dig>  in the ltr under both nested models. these sites are located just upstream of the ring motif. for the region after the breakage point, the test for positive selection was no longer significant, with p =  <dig>  in the ltr of m1a-m2a and p =  <dig>  in the lrt of m7–m <dig>  .

taken together, these results firmly establish that the loops of the zebrafish group a fintrim b <dig>  domains have been diversified under positive selection, as previously described for the sites determining virus specificity in trim5α, suggesting a selective pressure on this domain for binding to diverse ligands. a few positions located close to the ring motif are also subjected to diversification.

exon shuffling of b <dig>  domain occurred between fintrims and nlr
since fintrim b <dig>  features suggest that they may be involved in interactions with diverse ligands, similar b <dig>  domains may be used in other trim subfamilies for comparable purposes. we therefore searched the zebrafish genome for sequences closely related to typical fintrim b <dig>  domains. unexpectedly, the closest counterparts of fintrim b <dig>  sequences were not found in other trim, but were associated with nacht and leucine-rich repeats -ribonuclease inhibitor -like motifs in nlr proteins . these proteins, which possess a b <dig>  and a nacht domain and are very likely involved in innate immunity, have been identified very recently; such a combination is not found in mammals  <cit> . while the protein sequences of b <dig>  from group a ftrs were about 40% similar to b <dig>  domains from close trim relatives such as bloodthirsty or trim <dig>  they were  <dig> to 65% similar to b <dig>  from these nlr proteins, and about  <dig> to 55% similar to those of the group b or c ftr sequences . a phylogenetic analysis showed that b <dig>  sequences of group a fintrim and a subgroup of nlr  are joined as a cluster supported by a high bootstrap value . this cluster is quite distinct from that of other trims, including group b or group c ftr and btr, or even from the rest of b <dig> -bearing nlrs , suggesting an exon shuffling event between group a fintrims and group <dig> nlrs.

discussion
we have described here a large set of closely related genes and transcripts that contain the three motifs typical of trim proteins, namely the ring zinc finger, two b-boxes and a predicted coiled-coil region. their close relatedness allowed us to group these sequences in one multigene family, the fintrims. the fintrim genes were identified in all teleost fish species for which a genome database is available. in addition, we characterized a number of transcripts in rainbow trout and zebrafish, confirming that these genes are actively transcribed. although the gene numbers vary among the different teleost species, the wide distribution of the fintrim genes suggests an important role, one in which diversity offers a selective advantage to the host. since fintrims are specifically induced by viruses and poly, they probably play a role in antiviral immunity, as several other trims do in mammals.

fintrim diversity suggests that they recognize multiple ligands
the highly diverse fintrims are encoded by a large number of genes. this trim subset is a teleost-specific group, well distinct from other trims shared by fish and mammals as trim <dig>  trim <dig>  trim <dig> and others. next to the variety generated by the large number of genes, we demonstrate here that the b <dig>  domain of fintrim genes has evolved under diversifying selective forces. this indicates that these proteins bind a diverse range of ligands, making an immune function very plausible. consistent with a role in immune recognition, our current data suggest that there is a high allelic polymorphism among zebrafish fintrim genes. there are numerous examples of large polymorphic multigene families that are involved in innate immunity. the proteins they encode either recognize a variety of microbial patterns, or bind diverse receptors of the host immune system and participate in the tuning of complex activation pathways. such receptors include some mammalian trims  <cit> , but also the mammalian killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors   <cit>  and ly- <dig> related proteins  <cit> , chicken ig-like receptor   <cit> , fish novel immune-type receptors   <cit> , fish leukocyte immune-type receptors   <cit> , and sea urchin toll-like receptors  <cit> .

if fintrims are specifically involved in virus recognition or act as virus-restricting molecules, the high number of fintrim genes opens the possibility for parallel and simultaneous selection by different viruses  <cit> .

signatures of positively selected residues in fintrim b <dig>  equate with canonical motifs of the virus-binding sites in trim5α
the fintrim b <dig>  domain contributes dominantly to fintrim diversity, and seems to be generally similar in structure to the b <dig>  domain of trim <dig>  among the sequences of the multiple fintrims described in both trout and zebrafish, the variable sites are predominantly located in the variable loops of the domain, in a way that strongly suggests that the b <dig>  domains interacts with their ligands as trim5α does for viral proteins. in particular, the sites identified in zebrafish as subjected to significant diversifying  selection were concentrated in the variable loop  <dig>  between the β-strands  <dig> and  <dig>  this loop was earlier designated as a 'hotspot' region, since sites within this region determine the lentivirus restriction-specificity of trim5α and mutations in this region are correlated with the disease susceptibility associated with trim <dig>  and trim <dig>   <cit> . such a distribution of sites diversified under positive selection in the loop  <dig>  of the b <dig>  domain strongly supports both the reality of a diversifying selection and the diversity of ftr b <dig>  ligands.

in addition, we also found several sites under diversifying selection within the rbb domain, suggesting that additional sites may also be involved in binding of a ligand. a few sites were earlier shown to have evolved under diversifying selection in the coiled-coil region of proteins trim5α and trim <dig>  <cit> , but positive selection of ring and b-box domains was not reported. besides, the roles of the ring and b-box domains in trim function are still not fully understood, although deletion or mutations can abrogate the activity of trim5α, and the significance of the positively selected rbb residues in ftrs remains therefore elusive. in this context, one may also question the function of the fintrim genes that do not contain a b <dig>  domain . it is tempting to consider them as potential inhibitors/regulators of an antiviral response triggered by b <dig> -containing genes.

the evolutionary affinities of fintrim b <dig>  domains suggest a domain shuffling between nlr and trim molecules
an interesting finding was the close relationship of fintrim b <dig>  domains with the b <dig>  domains present in a subset of nlr proteins recently described in the zebrafish. nlr proteins, also known as caterpiller, nacht or nod-lrr proteins, are large cytoplasmic proteins involved in inflammation and apoptosis. they are characterized by a nacht domain and a leucine-rich repeat  region at the c-terminus and vary in their n-terminal effector domain, which is a card, pyrin or tir domain. as for trim proteins, the physiological functions of nlrs are diverse, and several nlrs are inhibitors/activators of the inflammatory and immune responses. for example, nalp3/cryopyrin is a key component of the inflammasome and inhibits tnf- and traf6- induced nfκb activation  <cit> , while nod <dig> plays a role in nfκb activation  <cit> . large groups of novel, fish-specific nlr proteins have been recently described in fish and appear to be highly related within each species, indicating recent species-specific expansions  <cit> . some of these teleost nlr proteins contain the nacht and lrr domains at the c-terminus in combination with a b <dig>  domains, as the nlr-c described in  <cit> . the close relatedness of these b <dig>  domains to the group a fintrim b <dig>  domain suggests that the corresponding exon have been subjected to shuffling between nlr and group a fintrim, that is, during ftr evolution . the exchange of a ligand-recognition module evolving under positive selection with another protein family mainly involved in inflammation, immune regulation and possibly pathogen sensing constitutes another argument supporting an immune function for group a fintrims.

phylogenetic analyses suggest that ftr appeared and diversified during the teleost evolution while trim16/25/ <dig> are more ancient genes common to all vertebrates
the fintrims and their relatives  followed different evolutionary pathways . both teleosts and mammals possess single orthologous trim <dig> and trim <dig>  as evidenced by phylogenetic analysis and conserved synteny. sequences coding for partial trim <dig> and trim <dig> were also identified in the elephant shark genome, confirming that these genes were already present in the early vertebrates. in contrast, fintrims seem to be unique to teleost fish and could not be found in any other group of animals. since they were present in all fish for which a significant amount of genomic data was available, fintrims most probably appeared during the early evolution of teleosts. while they are represented by large gene sets in zebrafish, salmonids and medaka, several fish species such as fugu or stickleback only possess a few copies of fintrim genes. thus, fintrim genes have been probably subjected to parallel – and independent – duplication events in the different branches of teleosts. this hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that zebrafish ftr genes were generally most similar to their immediate neighbors, suggesting tandem duplication within clusters rather than en bloc duplication as the main gene amplification mechanism.

this view is supported by the absence of obvious synteny between the regions encoding almost all fintrims in different teleosts. also, diverse mechanisms of gene spreading appear to have been used in different species, since many medaka fintrims are intronless in contrast to zebrafish ftr, suggesting that one or more retro-transposition events have been involved in the multiplication of these sequences. this observation is a good argument for a fast expansion in this species, and reinforces the idea of strong selection pressures towards fintrim diversification. such selection pressures exerted by species- or family-specific viruses are expected to be highly variable between different fish taxa. whether another trim set constrains or balances the evolution of fintrims, as described for anti-retroviral trim5α and trim <dig>  <cit> , remains to be established. also, the b <dig>  exon shuffling has complicated the fintrim evolutionary pathway.

fintrim group c is closest to other trims in the phylogenetic trees, suggesting that they appeared during the early evolution of teleosts. they are present in the different fish investigated so far but no counterpart was found in other vertebrates. interestingly, a conserved synteny of ftr82/ <dig> and a few neighboring markers was established in zebrafish, stickleback and medaka, indicating that they were kept in a more stable genomic context than other fintrims; it is also worth noting that in the medaka, these genes have retained the six-exon structure. also, several markers located close to ftr82/ <dig> in fish possess counterparts on the human chromosome  <dig>  where both trim <dig> and trim <dig> are located together with the markers defining their own conserved syntenies among vertebrates. this loose association is unlikely to have occurred by chance, and may suggest that certain group c fintrims could constitute an intermediate between the main fintrim family and the older trim genes  from which they appeared by duplication. this hypothesis fits well with the whole-genome duplication that occurred in the beginning of teleost evolution  <cit> . along the same line, ftr <dig> and ftr <dig>  together with ftr <dig>  are the most similar to trim <dig> among the fintrim relatives . trim <dig> is involved in ifn signaling, but interacts with endogenous rig-i and not with viral proteins  <cit> . it is therefore tempting to speculate that ftr <dig> and ftr <dig> have been restrained from duplications and diversifying selection by such a functional specialization. such a contrasted evolutionary history has been observed for example for the cytp <dig> superfamily: enzymes with endogenous substrates are phylogenetically stable, while xenobiotic detoxifiers are encoded in unstable gene islands that appeared by tandem duplication  <cit> . it could be argued that the quick radiation of group a fintrims was triggered when a trim25-like ftr acquired a b <dig>  exon maybe derived from a nlr gene, allowing the newly created fintrim to directly detect a pathogen motif. such an event would have occurred after the teleost-tetrapod split, and perhaps even after the divergence of main teleost lineages, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  it has to be underlined here that the phylogenetic analysis does not support a monophyletic origin of group b fintrims, which therefore probably constitute the tracks of several duplication/differentiation events in the fintrim group. such duplication events have been suggested to explain the expansion of trim genes in fish and other species  <cit> . a recent extensive survey of trims divided these proteins into two large groups: an evolutionary conserved group i comprising trim with various c-terminal domains, and a more recent group ii that groups sequences containing a b <dig>  domain and showing species-specific diversification. the presence of two b-box motifs – although the b-box- <dig> is rather degenerated – and the sequence similarity to trim <dig> and trim <dig> suggest that fintrims may be closer to group i. however, the fintrim evolutionary pathway described here fits better the properties of the group ii. our observations seem to reflect a fish-specific evolutionary pathway of a trim subset derived from ancestral group i members by an ancient duplication.

the evolutionary pathways of trim <dig> is rather different since it was retrieved as a single gene in mammals but as a multigene set in several teleosts. trim <dig> is a member of the group ii as described in  <cit>  and the diversification observed in the zebrafish is well in accordance with the evolutionary properties of this group. thus, there are more than  <dig> orthologs of trim <dig> in zebrafish. we named these genes btrs for 'bloodthirsty-like trims', as one of them is known as bloodthirsty, a gene involved in erythropoiesis  <cit> . these observations indicate that trim <dig> was already present in the common ancestor to fish and mammals, but was subjected to a successful expansion by duplication in at least some lineages of teleosts.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results indicate that the fintrim family has been subjected to a quick, extensive diversification by duplication and specialization under positive selection exerted on positions concentrated in the b <dig>  domain. the sharing of b <dig>  domains with nlr emphasizes the shuffling of a putative target-binding module between two major protein families involved in immune recognition of pathogen specific motifs  <cit> . while the targets of fintrims have yet to be identified, this first survey suggests that fintrims are involved the antiviral innate immune system. our future work will be aimed at a further understanding of the biological functions of the fintrims.
