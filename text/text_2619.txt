BACKGROUND
knowledge about the metabolic network of an organism is essential for understanding its physiology and phenotypic behavior. a comprehensive understanding of the metabolic network at the system level is particularly important for both biotechnological and biomedical research and is now made possible by rapid advances in genome sequencing and functional genomics. in silico reconstruction of metabolic networks from genome sequences of organisms represents a starting point for a systematic analysis of metabolism  <cit> . the functionality of the potential metabolic network of a given organism can then be further experimentally studied by system perturbations at both physiological and genetic levels  <cit> .

several methods and tools have been recently developed for the reconstruction, visualization and analysis of metabolic networks. these include general static metabolic network tools such as the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> , the boehringer mannheim metabolic charts  <cit>  and dynamic or potentially dynamic tools such as wit  <cit> , mpw  <cit> , ecocyc  <cit>  and pathfinder  <cit> . metabolic network reconstruction is generally based on the identification of metabolic enzymes and the corresponding biochemical reactions in a specific organism. for this purpose the ec numbers of all possible enzymes need to be determined. the set of ec numbers of an organism may be obtained from the genome annotation. this conventional approach of metabolic network reconstruction is briefly summarized in fig. 1a. it covers three successive steps:  gene finding,  database searching and function assignment and  metabolic reconstruction. in the first step, genes or coding sequences  are predicted from the genome data using programs such as glimmer  <cit> , genemarks  <cit> , zcurve  <cit>  or critica  <cit> . then, coding sequences are used as queries and compared to sequence databases such as genbank, genpept and swiss-prot or to databases of protein domains and functional sites such as interpro  <cit> , prosite  <cit> , pfam  <cit>  etc. based on the similarity, the function of the database entry may be assigned to a cds as its annotation. from these function assignments the metabolic network can be constructed. this three-step approach is used for example in the wit system  <cit> . efforts were also made in some bioinformatic systems such as wit to reconstruct metabolic networks from incomplete genome data  <cit> . the program suite ergo™, a commercial version of wit, integrates over  <dig> finished and unfinished genomes into a comprehensive network of metabolic and non-metabolic pathways  <cit> . no details about the wit approach have been published and merely some information about  <dig> annotated genomes  is publicly available on the website of wit  <cit> .

the three-step method starting from gene finding has several drawbacks for the reconstruction of the metabolic network from incomplete or unfinished genome sequences. in unfinished sequences of a genome, especially in sequences with a low genome coverage , there may be many sequencing errors that do not warrant an accurate prediction of genes  <cit> . for example, the start or stop positions of cdss may not be accurately predicted. protein sequences translated from these cdss may be completely wrong because of coding frame shifts. fusion cdss may be predicted, to which the function assignment is difficult. moreover, a cds that normally appears as one cds in other organisms may be predicted as several smaller fragmented cdss. on the other hand, existing cdss may not be found at all, either because of sequencing errors or because of limitations of the gene finding software. for eukaryotes, the prediction of cdss is even more difficult because of the existence of introns.

to avoid these problems, alternative methods are required for directly reconstructing metabolic networks from unfinished genome data. sequencing and annotation are still time and resource consuming. an as early as possible exploitation of the genome data is of importance for functional genome research. in this work, we propose a method to identify coding sequences for proteins  directly from unannotated low-coverage genomic data for in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network. the method is demonstrated with genome data from two organisms. a program combining automatic prediction and function assignment of cdss with a visualization and comparison of metabolic networks of different organisms is also delivered.

principle of the new method
the principle of the new method is schematically shown in fig. 1b. in comparison to the conventional three-step method  our method can be called a two-step approach. to avoid the separate step of gene finding in the conventional methods, we propose to reverse the searching relationship between public databases and the query sequence: gene or protein sequences from public databases are taken as queries, while the sequences in the unannotated genome of a given organism are treated as a local database that can be searched using a standalone algorithm of blast  <cit> . this results in the prediction of possible cdss in the genome and simultaneously their functions. functional information about these cdss is then used to reconstruct the metabolic network. thus, our method can significantly simplify the process of cds prediction and metabolic network reconstruction. by skipping over the separated steps of gene-finding and function assignment, our method can avoid or relax some of the problems of the traditional methods mentioned above.

RESULTS
evaluation of identics for identifying protein coding sequences from genome sequences of s. typhimurium lt2
to examine the applicability of the method proposed, the well-annotated genome sequences of s. typhimurium lt <dig>  <cit>  are used as "standard of truth" for statistic evaluation. according to the annotation given in the kegg database, s. typhimurium lt <dig> has  <dig> cdss, out of which  <dig> have been annotated with enzyme ec numbers. these cdss encompass  <dig> different unique ec numbers. the reliability of cds prediction by the program identics is evaluated by using a nucleotide database  and a combined protein database  separately. the annotated coding sequences or proteins of s. typhimurium were filtered out of these databases before sequence alignment. all cdss having an e-value less than 10- <dig> were accepted and submitted for comparison with the kegg annotation of s. typhimurium. the results are summarized in table  <dig>   <dig> % and  <dig> %  of the cdss in the original annotation of s. typhimurium are identified by using the kegg genome database and the whole protein database swiss-prot and trembl, respectively. the sensitivity on the nucleotide level  is similar as on the cds level. these results suggest that the swiss-prot-trembl based approach is more preferable than the kegg genome based approach for our method. it is understood that the combined protein database swiss-prot and trembl contains almost all of the known protein sequences available in public databases  while the kegg database contains only a limited number of sequenced and annotated genomes. the difference becomes more significant if the organism studied is evolutionarily far from any organism whose genome is completely sequenced and annotated.

the specificity of the method is about 81–82% on the cds level and  <dig> – <dig> % on the nucleotide level for the kegg genome database and the whole protein database swiss-prot and trembl. the moderate specificity on cds level is due to the relatively high amount of additionally predicted cdss . it should be mentioned that all the additionally predicted cdss have quite strong statistic significance . these additional cdss may be missed in the original annotation and could in fact represent good candidates for an improved annotation of the genome.

the inconsistence rate by identics is as low as  <dig> % for the kegg genome database and  <dig> % for the swiss-prot and trembl protein database, indicating the reliability of our method.

in the above mentioned evaluation of the method, the cut-off e-value is less than 1e- <dig> for the cds prediction. further the effects of different scoring parameters  and their cut-off values on the cds prediction by using the database swiss-prot and trembl are examined.  show the distribution of the true positive cdss, false positive cdss, sensitivity and specificity as function of bits score, e-value and identities respectively. the major part of the false positive cdss is found in the regions of bits score less than ca.  <dig> and e-value larger than 1e- <dig>  the specificity increases with the bits score and e-value in a form of a saturation curve while the sensitivity decreases almost linearly. this indicates that the prediction performance can be further optimized by choosing appropriate cut-off parameters. if the cdss with bits score less than  <dig>  are rejected, the false positive will decrease by 40%  while the false negative will increase from  <dig> to  <dig> . the prediction specificity increases from  <dig> % to  <dig> % at the expense of a slight decrease in the sensitivity from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the specificity of identics can be further improved by combining a third criterion, i.e. identities > = 25% . thus, the sensitivity and specificity of identics for cds prediction are satisfactory and can be balanced to certain extent by choosing proper scoring parameters.

identification of enzyme-coding sequences in s. typhimurium lt2
for the reconstruction of metabolic network it is desired to know the enzyme-coding sequences, and especially the ec-number containing enzymes in an organism. the possibility to use the ec number-containing subset of the combined protein database swiss-prot + trembl to identify enzyme-coding sequences in s. typhimurium lt <dig> and thus to further reduce the computation time for constructing the metabolic network is examined .  <dig> of ec-number containing cdss  are identified. of the  <dig> originally annotated ec-cdss,  <dig> % of them are identified with an annotation inconsistence rate of as low as  <dig> %. the specificity appears to be relatively low due to the large number of false positives. however, if the prediction of ec-cdss is compared to all the originally annotated cdss, the number of true positive ec-cdss is increased from  <dig> to  <dig> and the number of false positive ec-cdss is decreased from  <dig> to  <dig>  resulting in a specificity of  <dig> %. the inconsistence rate still remains at a low level, indicating the prediction and function assignment for the additionally predicted ec-cdss is correct and their ec numbers are missed in the original annotation. this can helps in reconstructing a more complete metabolic network.

the kegg genomes based prediction is also evaluated for its ability to predict the enzyme-coding sequences.  <dig> % of the cdss originally annotated to have an ec-number are correctly predicted and assigned with ec numbers. this value is slightly lower than the one based on the swiss-prot+trembl database. the more complete protein databases are therefore more suitable for ec-cds identification as well.

identification of enzyme coding sequences with different coverage of genome sequences of k. pneumoniae
both the kegg genomes and swiss-prot-trembl databases are used to identify enzyme-coding sequences from the  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold coverage genome sequences of k. pneumoniae. from the  <dig> -fold coverage genome, identics identified  <dig> and  <dig> ec-cdss by applying the kegg genome database and swiss-prot-trembl databases, respectively, whereas from the  <dig> -fold genome sequences  <dig> and  <dig> ec-cdss, respectively. as in the case of s. typhimurium, identics identified 15% to 30% more ec-cdss with queries from swiss-prot-trembl than with queries from kegg for the two versions of k. pneumoniae genome sequences respectively. the number of ec-cdss identified for k. pneumoniae is comparable to that identified for s. typhimurium with the respective databases. they are also comparable to the number  of annotated ec-cdss of e. coli based on the kegg genome database. with the method proposed by ma and zeng  <cit> , the structure and evolution distance of the metabolic networks of these three organisms and other  <dig> bacteria are compared. the metabolic network of k. pneumoniae is found to be most similar to those of e. coli and s. typhimurium . thus, the predicted number of enzyme-encoding sequences for k. pneumoniae appears to be reasonable. with the same  <dig> -fold coverage genome sequences of k. pneumoniae, the method of wit predicted  <dig> ec-cdss which are twice the number of ec-cdss in e. coli and s. typhimurium. the ec-cdss predicted by wit are significantly smaller and fragmented, possibly because of the presence of too many errors in the unfinished genome sequences. the fragmentation problem was overcome in our method that leads to a significant reduction in the number of identified ec-cdss. the less false positive ec-cdss will further simplify experimental design such as for microarray to examine the metabolic network.

a comparison of the unique ec numbers of ec-cdss identified from the two different versions of genome sequences and by the different approaches reveals that the results of these different combinations share over 80% of common ec numbers . the wit version contains more ec numbers than other versions, obviously because the criteria used in our approaches allow a region to have only one function or an ec number whereas the method used by wit allows more. with the  <dig> -fold genome sequences both kegg and swiss-prot based methods identified a certain number of ec numbers  that are not identified by wit. interestingly, the two different versions of genome sequences result in very close ec numbers. the kegg based approach identified only  <dig>  more and the swiss-prot-trembl based approach identified merely  <dig>  more by using the  <dig> -fold genome sequences than by using the  <dig> -fold genome sequences . this indicates that the  <dig> -fold coverage genome sequences result in a fairly good estimation of enzyme-coding sequences for the purpose of an in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network of k. pneumoniae. it would be of interest to examine if this also applies to other organisms or even lower genome coverage. the use of lower genome coverage sequences for studying cellular metabolism will greatly accelerate the exploitation of genome sequencing projects.

the ec numbers of k. pneumoniae as identified by the combination of  <dig> -fold genome sequences and swiss-prot and trembl databases are summarized in table  <dig> in terms of different functional categories. more than half of the enzymes are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, cofactors and vitamins.  <dig> % –  <dig> % of the enzymes in the different kegg metabolism categories can be found in k. pneumoniae . these values are comparable to the values of several evolutionarily closely related strains such as escherichia coli, s. typhimurium, s. typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa and yersinia pestis.

comparison of identics and critica for identifying coding sequence from low coverage genome sequences
critica is a well-developed program for the prediction of coding sequences  <cit> . it combines the comparative analysis of dna sequences with noncomparative methods . we compared critica and identics for predicting cdss from the two different versions of k. pneumoniae genomic sequences. the comparison is done on the basis of all the cdss including non-enzyme coding sequences. the results are summarized in table  <dig> 

from the  <dig> -fold coverage genome data, critica predicts  <dig> cdss with a cut-off p-value = - <dig> suggested by badger and olsen  <cit> , while identics predicted  <dig> cdss .  <dig> % of the cdss predicted by critica are covered by the prediction of identics. o, in many cases two or more smaller cdss predicted by critica are covered by a cds predicted by identics, obviously because of the relatively high sequencing errors in the  <dig> -fold coverage genome data. critica predicts  <dig> fusion coding sequences. since they have similarities to two different functions, function assignment to this kind of fusion cdss is uncertain. half of the critica-specific cdss have p-values between 1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig>  in comparison, of the  <dig> cdss merely predicted by identics, all have e-values less than 1e- <dig>  27% have e-values less than 1e-40; all the cdss have an identity greater than 20% and 60% have an identity greater than 50%, indicating that the predictions by identics have a high confidence.

from the  <dig> -fold coverage genome data, critica predicts  <dig> cdss. this number is much less than the cds number predicted from the  <dig> -fold coverage. this may be explained by the significant decrease of sequence errors in the  <dig> -fold genome data. in contrast, cdss predicted by identics are only  <dig> less than that predicted from the  <dig> -fold genome data.  <dig> % of the critica predictions are covered by the  <dig> cdss predicted by identics. only  <dig> cdss predicted by critica span two or more cdss. this shows that the increase of sequence quality increases the precision of the prediction of critica. again, the identics-specific predictions have a high confidence: all with e-values less than 1e- <dig> and amino acid sequence identities greater than 20%, more than 50% with e-values less than 1e- <dig> and identities greater than 50%. the fact that in some cases fusion cdss are predicted by critica and in other cases many highly potential coding regions are not predicted as cdss indicates a shortcoming in this algorithm for low quality contigs. when critica finds a coding region with a high score, it tries to find the start and stop codons by extending this region to both upstream and downstream with the conditions of not decreasing the total score after extension. sequencing errors, especially translation shifts, make it difficult for critica to calculate the extension score correctly. in such cases, the algorithm used by identics does not need to locate the start and stop codons. transcription frame shifts also have less interference to identics because it does not use predicted coding sequence as queries but uses entries from public database to search for coding sequences in the raw genome sequences of an organism. these features make identics more suitable for identifying possible protein-coding regions from low-coverage error-containing raw genome sequences than other available approaches.

reconstruction and visualization of metabolic networks for comparison
with the identified enzyme-encoding sequences discussed above the potential metabolic networks of s. typhimurium and k. pneumoniae can be reconstructed and compared to other organisms. the reconstruction of metabolic networks can be done in a similar way as based on cdss from annotated genome sequences as recently described by ma and zeng  <cit> . briefly, from the identified ec numbers of cdss, the set of biochemical reactions involved in the organism can be established with the help of a reaction database . from the reaction set, a connection matrix is obtained that can be used to represent the metabolic network as a directed graph for computational analysis.

for a straightforward visualization of the biochemical reactions related to a specific organism and especially for comparing the metabolisms of different organisms, the kegg metabolic maps act as a blueprint for visualization of metabolic networks in this work. reconstruction, comparison and visualization of the metabolic network have been integrated in the program identics as a built-in component. it can work directly with the coding sequences and their functions predicted by identics or with existing annotation files such as the those in microsoft excel format or in genbank flat file format. to use the kegg maps for metabolic reconstruction, comparison and visualization information from the kegg metabolic pathways is reformed into an excel template. metabolic network reconstruction is realized by mapping the identified enzymes  to the kegg metabolic maps. different similarity levels of the identified enzymes can be displayed in different colors. all identified enzymes in the map are marked and linked to their annotations. web links to other internet databases such as iubmb  <cit> , brenda  <cit> , wit  <cit> , kegg  <cit> , ecocyc  <cit>  and swiss-prot  <cit>  are also integrated to offer the user a fast tool to access the relevant information. for metabolic network comparison, strain-specific colored boxes are drawn on the lower part of the ec number rectangle if that strain possesses this enzyme as demonstrated in fig.  <dig> for the glycolysis pathways. this box is linked to the original annotation of the enzyme in that strain. the background of the enzyme box becomes green if this enzyme is found in all the compared organisms. in such a way an informative metabolic network is generated which can serve as a starting point for functional and comparative analysis of the metabolism of organisms under study.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of genome sequences from s. typhimurium and k. pneumoniae demonstrated the applicability and reliability of the new method proposed for in silico identification of protein coding sequences from unannotated genome sequences. the use of protein sequence databases swiss-prot and trembl is more favorable than the use of kegg genome database for identifying coding sequences and thus for metabolic network reconstruction. furthermore, the method allows an adequate reconstruction of the potential metabolic network from sequence data with low coverage  of the bacterial genome as shown for k. pneumoniae. together with the algorithms for the automatic annotation of sequences, the visualization and comparison of metabolic networks, the method and program developed in this work can accelerate the use of genomic data for studying cellular metabolism.
