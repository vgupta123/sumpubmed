BACKGROUND
how new species arise is a fundamental question in biology. historically, the formation of new species has been studied in a wide variety of organisms whose natural history provides special insight into the ecological and geographic conditions thought to lead to speciation  <cit> . but in only a tiny subset of these organisms has it been possible to apply the full power of modern genetics - the ability to identify, sequence, and experimentally manipulate any gene in the genome - to the study of reproductive isolation  <cit> . recent advances in sequencing technology, however, have begun to break this constraint. genomic resources can now be obtained, and are being obtained, for the entire wide range of organisms needed to study the multitudinous modes of speciation  <cit> .

here we have applied transcriptome pyrosequencing to an organism proposed to have undergone sympatric, ecological speciation: the apple maggot fly, rhagoletis pomonella . a population of this native north american fruit-feeding insect infesting hawthorn  shifted to attack introduced apple  in about  <dig>  <cit> , becoming an economically-important crop pest and, almost immediately after, an evolutionary cause célèbre  <cit> . the central premise of sympatric speciation in r. pomonella is that ecological adaptation to apple has resulted in the formation of a new apple-infesting host race of the fly that is partially reproductively isolated from ancestral hawthorn-infesting populations, a critical first step in the process of ecological sympatric speciation.

the last decade has seen an intensified search for "speciation genes"  <cit>  responsible for reproductive barriers between taxa. for the apple and hawthorn host races of r. pomonella, two traits have been shown to be of particular importance in host adaptation, and, concomitantly, reproductive isolation. the first trait is host fidelity; because rhagoletis flies mate on or near the fruit of their respective host plants, differences in host choice translate directly into mate choice and prezygotic reproductive isolation  <cit> . adult flies use volatile compounds emitted from the surface of ripening fruit as key olfactory cues to find and discriminate among host plants  <cit> . flies of the hawthorn and apple host races are attracted to the fruit odors of their respective hosts, and even avoid the odors of the other host fruit  <cit> . odor attraction has a genetic basis, but it has not yet been possible to map specific olfactory loci in rhagoletis  <cit> . but because of the relative phylogenetic proximity of tephritidae to drosophilidae, candidate loci for odor recognition can be inferred from the extensive research on chemoreception in d. melanogaster  <cit> .

the second trait reproductively isolating the apple and hawthorn host races is life-history timing . rhagoletis flies are univoltine and typically have just one generation per year. flies overwinter as diapausing pupae in the soil and emerge the next summer just prior to the peak of host fruit availability. because the host plants of r. pomonella fruit at different times of year and adult flies live for only about a month, the flies must differentially time their life histories to match maximal host fruit availability for mating and oviposition. the apple race has been selected for both deeper initial diapause depth and earlier post winter eclosion  <cit> , in response to the 2- <dig> week earlier fruiting time of domestic apples compared to hawthorns. differences in diapause timing between the host races have been associated with a series of chromosome inversions thought to contain linked blocks of genes that affect diapause depth and timing, and thereby allochronic mating isolation between the two host races  <cit> . specific loci functionally affecting diapause have not yet been identified and mapped within the inversions for rhagoletis, but genes associated with diapause entry, maintenance, and termination have been described for other insects  <cit> , providing useful candidate loci for analysis in rhagoletis.

although host fruit choice and diapause timing are the key isolating traits, other traits may play a role in reproductive isolation in rhagoletis, and could be analyzed given genomic resources for rhagoletis. among these are genes for differential larval fitness on the two hosts  <cit>  and for host-independent sexual isolation  <cit> . in addition, because there is great genetic similarity within the r. pomonella species complex  <cit> , ests generated from r. pomonella will be useful for the genetic analysis of the entire sibling species complex, including economically-important crop pests like the blueberry maggot r. mendax curran, and the evolutionarily significant "lonicera fly", a recent population of hybrid r. mendax × r. zephyria origin  <cit> .

although the two host races are largely reproductively isolated, low rates of gene flow do occur between the two host races at sites where both occur together  <cit> . therefore, the r. pomonella host races provide an exceptionally clear example of a "divergence with gene flow" process  <cit> . for some chromosome inversions in r. pomonella this process can be studied directly, because the forces producing the balance between host adaptation and the erosion of this adaptation by ongoing gene flow have actually been measured instead of just inferred  <cit> . but for the more typical case, in rhagoletis and elsewhere, divergence with gene flow can be studied quantitatively only by measuring variation in divergence among large numbers of loci  <cit> . while allozyme loci  <cit> , and more recently several dozen microsatellite marker loci  <cit> , have provided important insights into population structure and ecological speciation in the r. pomonella host races, marker density remains low and developing a series of higher density markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms  would provide greater resolution for studies of divergence with gene flow. furthermore high densities of snps would provide markers for additional studies like classical genetic mapping, analysis of population structure, and association mapping of loci that are involved in differential host adaptation.

therefore the primary goals of our study were to: 1) characterize a substantial representation of the r. pomonella transcriptome, and 2) to use the assembly of numerous short reads into contigs to identify snp markers for future studies. in addition to meeting these goals, we have preliminarily identified snps that differ between the two host races, we have identified clear differences in the abundance of transcripts between developmental stages, even in normalized cdna libraries, and we have identified several transcripts that suggest interesting patterns of gene loss or gain among the higher flies.

RESULTS
overall sequencing
to maximize transcriptome sampling we made individual libraries for larvae, pupae, adult heads, and headless adult bodies, and sequenced each library separately across several  <dig> plates . the combined analysis of all runs produced  <dig>  sequences that assembled into  <dig>  contigs . the mean length of contigs was  <dig> bp, which compares well with the means of  <dig> and  <dig> in two other recent 454-based transcriptome studies  <cit> . contig lengths stretched from  <dig> bp  to a maximum of  <dig> bp. contig lengths of  <dig> -  <dig> bp were most frequent, but contigs >  <dig> bp still constituted 32% of all contigs . the range of number of reads was broad, stretching from  <dig> to  <dig>  the distribution was nevertheless strongly skewed towards contigs with few reads. the mean number of reads per contig was  <dig> , but the distribution was highly skewed towards lower read numbers per contig with a long tail of contigs with many reads . only 25% of contigs had  <dig> reads or more, and 2% of contigs had  <dig> reads or more with  <dig> as the highest number of reads/contig . after we filtered all remaining singleton sequences for repeat regions a set of  <dig>  singletons were left,  <dig>  of which were  <dig> bp or longer. files containing our raw sequences and quality scores are available for blast search at genbank srx <dig> and srx <dig> , srx <dig> , srx <dig> , and srx <dig> .

we annotated our assembled pool of r. pomonella sequences  to the non-redundant d. melanogaster protein coding dataset. our sequences matched  <dig> unique d. melanogaster proteins with high confidence . this corresponds to ca. 48% of all known d. melanogaster structural, protein-coding genes. assuming that rhagoletis has a similar gene number as such diverse diptera as anopheles , drosophila  and aedes , our  <dig>  protein-coding genes represent between 40% and 52% of the estimated number of r. pomonella protein-coding genes. we note that the exact numbers of genes inferred to be sampled in r. pomonella may vary somewhat as we obtain a better understanding of alterative splicing, which will be possible with larger transcriptome data sets. unannotated contig assemblies are available at genbank ez <dig> - ez <dig>  the data, organized into four files, are also available at http://www.life.illinois.edu/berlocher/454_pyrosequencing_files/. two excel files contain annotations of contigs matching protein-coding genes  and singletons . two text files, "rhagoletis_pom_all_seq.txt" and "rhagoletis_pom_contig_seq.txt", contain sequences, and contig and uaccno numbers  to allow for coordination of results.

a notable result of the "short length/high copy" output of pyrosequencing is that some transcripts were sequenced as  <dig> or  <dig> noncontiguous fragments that mapped to different parts of the respective homologous drosophila protein. thirty percent of all drosophila genes matched by our ests were matches by both multiple singletons and a contig, demonstrating that a sizable proportion of transcripts were sequenced as multiple, independent pieces. having several separate fragments distributed at multiple places in any transcript can facilitate efforts to develop full-length sequences for transcripts of interest using traditional pcr-based methods, such as race.

our sequenced fragments matched ca. 50% of all known d. melanogaster genes; although our relatively stringent cut-off of e- <dig> for the protein matches with d. melanogaster certainly omitted valid matches to some singletons and/or highly divergent genes. for example, some of the alignments to odorant receptors had e-values several orders of magnitudes larger than e- <dig>  but could still be unequivocally identified as odorant receptors due to the unique sequence structure of these proteins. directed searches for additional candidate transcripts will undoubtedly reveal many more identifications.

a total of  <dig>  of our  <dig>  annotated transcripts were assigned to  <dig> major sub-categories in the biological process go category . to determine if the transcripts we identified were representative of our expectations for the transcriptome as a whole, we compared the distribution of r. pomonella sequences mapping to the go sub-categories described above with similar distributions of transcripts from the entire drosophila melanogaster genome, and the partial transcriptome of the flesh fly sarcophaga crassipalpis, another higher fly for which a substantial est database has recently been developed using 454-pyrosequencing  <cit> . while there are small differences in the percentage of transcripts across sub-categories between the three species of flies, none were significantly under- or over-represented across the three species . therefore, the overall concordance between the distributions across all three species suggests that the sequences generated in this project are broadly representative of the r. pomonella transcriptome . therefore, we have achieved our first major goal of describing a substantial, representative portion of the r. pomonella transcriptome.

candidate transcripts for host fruit discrimination and diapause, two mechanisms of reproductive isolation between the host races
in addition to our relatively stringent bulk annotations , we specifically searched our contigs and singletons for transcripts that we expected to be involved in host odor discrimination and diapause, two traits contributing to reproductive isolation between the two host races. in searching for receptors, we made use of unique features of receptors , and in some cases we were able to identify receptors for which the e-value was substantially greater than e- <dig>  in our search for chemoreception transcripts, we identified contigs or singletons representing  <dig> odorant receptors ,  <dig> gustatory receptors , and  <dig> of the newly described  <cit>  ionotropic glutamate receptors , with multiple fragments for some transcripts . all r. pomonella putative ors were represented by a single read with the exception of one matching d. melanogaster or 49b, sequenced in two separate, non-overlapping reads. the r. pomonella receptor ests were short and ranged in size from 116- <dig> bp . if r. pomonella has a similar number of ors to d. melanogaster, we estimate that we recovered sequences from about 10% of the ors  <cit> .

‡a second fragment, ez4bi6301fzm <dig>  was identical but shorter .

one of our ors is homologous to rsor <dig>  previously sequenced in an antennal est library from the walnut husk fly r. suavis using conventional cloning/sanger sequencing  <cit> . we did not find matches to the two other tephritid fly ors reported thus far, both recovered from the medfly ceratitis capitata using conventional cloning/sanger sequencing of a head est library  <cit> . one of these, the non-canonical d. melanogaster or83b, is highly conserved throughout the insects  <cit>  and its absence in rhagoletis would be surprising. however, one of the major problems in searching for or sequences is their very low level of expression; in drosophila, previous work found only about one or per  <dig>  clones in an antennal library  <cit>  using conventional cloning/sanger sequencing. given this challenge, it is worthwhile to compare approaches for recovering tephritid ors. the recovery of  <dig> or in  <dig> est sequences in the r. suavis study by ramsedell et al.  <cit>  suggests that starting with antennae is very effective - but it is also very labor intensive, and was not used in this study for that reason. a previous study describing ors from medflies  <cit>  and ours both started with mrna from adult heads, but the two studies differ in sequencing methodology. the roughly four times higher capture of receptor transcripts in our study  is almost certainly due to the due to the higher number of ests that are generated by a pyrosequencing approach . but pyrosequencing fragments are typically shorter than conventional sanger sequences, and all of our fragments represent 30% or less of the receptor length as estimated by alignment with d. melanogaster. recovery of sequences of interest was similarly low for irs and grs. for example we found only two grs, which represents only ca. 3% of the  <dig> grs that have been discovered in d. melanogaster. ligands have been identified for drosophila homologues of two of the eight odorant receptors identified in this study. both or43a and or49a respond to compounds typical of fruit odors  <cit> . although none of these compounds match fruit volatiles identified thus far as cues for r. pomonella  <cit> , the d. melanogaster work suggests that or43a and 49a may well be involved in fruit odor detection and therefore are good candidates for future work on host fruit discrimination.

our recovery rate was much better for the highly expressed obps . the  <dig> r. pomonella obps we discovered in this study correspond to 43% of the  <dig> known number of d. melanogaster obps. alignment with d. melanogaster sequences showed that we obtained complete coding sequences for many r. pomonella obp ests. we also found cases in which a single d. melanogaster obp represented the best match to two different r. pomonella ests, as is also the case in r. suavis  <cit> , indicating either gene loss in d. melanogaster or a duplication in the rhagoletis lineage after the last common ancestor between drosophilids and tephritids.

*homologous sequence also found in the congener r. suavis.

we also discovered fragments of two gustatory receptors  homologous to drosophila gr43a and gr64b . to our knowledge these are the first gr sequences described for a tephritid fly. ligands have been described for only a small proportion of the  <dig> d. melanogaster grs, but among them are the polycistronic gr <dig> sugar receptors  <cit>  that we also recovered from r. pomonella heads. the role of contact chemoreception is largely unstudied in rhagoletis but could be important in detecting differences in fruit surface compounds  <cit> , in the chemical composition of the fruit during oviposition  <cit> , and in host-independent mate choice  <cit> . all of these factors and processes could act as reproductive barriers between rhagoletis species. comparative molecular evolutionary analysis of ors and grs suggests that these chemoreceptors are correlated with host specialization in d. sechellia and d. erecta  <cit> , two monophagous specialist species within the mostly polyphagous melanogaster species complex. characterizing olfactory and gustatory transcripts in rhagoletis provides an opportunity to assess the role of chemoreception in the divergence of a group of phytophagous insects with an extensive radiation into diverse hosts  <cit> .

although genomic regions correlating with diapause timing have been identified in r. pomonella  <cit> , specific loci functionally affecting diapause have not yet been identified and mapped in this species. however, genes associated with diapause entry, maintenance, and termination have been described for other insects  <cit> , providing useful candidates for analysis in rhagoletis. we generated a list of  <dig> candidate transcripts by compiling the sets of candidate genes identified by denlinger et al.  <cit>  and hahn et al.  <cit>  with transcripts classified as being involved in either "circadian rhythm" or "eclosion rhythm" in the go matches above. we identified a subset of  <dig> of these  <dig> candidate transcripts involved in several major physiological pathways associated with diapause including stress proteins, nutrient storage and metabolism, and endocrine signaling . like the chemoreception candidates above, these transcripts provide a substantial resource for functional studies of diapause in r. pomonella.

marker development
we also achieved our second major goal, identifying a broad panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms  for r. pomonella. in total we identified  <dig>  snps distributed across  <dig> contigs. snps were approximately randomly distributed across biological process go categories  with slight underrepresentation within cell signalling  and overrepresentation within metabolism . these snp locations provide a wealth of information for development of high-throughput downstream population and quantitative genetic applications such as bead chip panels or pull-down marker enrichment strategies followed by direct sequencing. this broad-based approach will allow us to identify regions of genomic similarity and differentiation between interbreeding host races and closely-related species, thereby identifying divergent regions that may house "speciation genes", and testing current models of divergence with gene flow  <cit> .

because all pupae in this experiment came from a hawthorn population while all larvae came from an apple population, we can also make some initial inferences about snp genotypes that differ among apple and hawthorn populations. we identified  <dig> snps distributed across  <dig> contigs that demonstrated allele frequency differences among the host races in our samples. of the  <dig> contigs,  <dig> were annotated , against the drosophila melanogaster genome, although only  <dig> had characterized assignments within the go biological process functional category . we were able to assign reading frames to  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated contigs containing  <dig> total snps. of these snps,  <dig>  were nonsynonymous. however, our confidence in the reading frame is highest within the local blastx alignments, and of  <dig> snps located in these regions only  <dig>  were nonsynomymous . the latter percentage suggests that there may be quite substantial variation among the host races at the protein coding level. several of the transcripts containing among host-race snps play important roles in metabolism, stress responses, and signalling processes that we expect are important in the diapause response  <cit> , including pyruvate kinase, hsp  <dig> and  <dig>  superoxide dismutase ii, and juvenile hormone esterase  binding protein and malic enzyme . of these we were able to identify nonsynonymous snps in jhe binding protein and me. malic enzyme is one of the original set of allozyme markers used to genetically discriminate the host races  <cit> . one of the two snps in me falls within the local blastx peptide alignment with drosophila malic enzyme at residue  <dig>  in the first codon position, and produces a change from a polar  to a nonpolar  amino acid. six  <dig> reads from the apple population  and  <dig> from the haw population  cover the snp. the malic enzyme allozyme polymorphism  is tightly associated with host-race differences in seasonality  <cit>  and may warrant future functional studies given our independent identification of host-specific non-synonymous polymorphism in an unguided analysis. admittedly, our inferences about host-race specific differences in snp frequencies in this study are limited because our sampling of the two host races was uneven with the hawthorn population only represented by pupae and the apple population only represented by larvae. however, the host-race specific snps identified in this study represent a pool of strong candidates for future validation.

pyrosequencing est databases can also identify other sequences useful for population and quantitative genetic studies, such as microsatellite loci  <cit> . using msatcommander  <cit>  we conservatively identified  <dig> microsatellite repeats among our contigs and singletons . we have not yet formally assessed any of these loci for variability, but they may be a useful supplement to a panel of  <dig> gt-enriched microsatellites that have previously been developed  <cit>  and successfully used for studies of r. pomonella population structure  <cit> .

expression differences in larval and pupal transcripts
despite normalization, we obtained some information about stage-specific expression from our separately sequenced stage libraries . we point out at the onset that we are not suggesting that accurate measurement of expression differences can or should be performed on normalized libraries, only that large, essentially "on or off" expression information can be obtained in the very first transciptome study on a species by tagging or separately sequencing different stages or tissues. to illustrate the potential for finding such large stage-biased expression differences, we compared a subset of transcripts in our larval and pupal pools that we expected would have larval-biased expression. these included larval cuticle transcripts  <cit>  and transcripts for the digestive enzyme trypsin; neither should be produced during the non-feeding pupal stage  <cit> . our panel of larval cuticle genes  showed the expected bias with  <dig> out of  <dig> reads  occurring in larval samples . similarly, of the  <dig> trypsin-related contigs,  <dig> out of  <dig> reads  occurred in larval samples. the percentage of these transcripts expressed in the larva would undoubtedly be greater in non-normalized rna, but the unequal expression pattern we found is quite clear.

estimates of gene loss and gain in comparison with drosophila
we identified two transcripts, for the genes armadillo repeat-containing-protein  <dig> and cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein, for which the evidence strongly supports gene loss in drosophila. protein blast search revealed that r. pomonella contig  <dig>  was very similar to the armadillo repeat-containing-protein  <dig> locus of highly divergent organisms ranging from the mosquito culex quinquifasciatus , homo sapiens , the placozoan trichoplax adhaerens , and the fungus ajellomyces dermatitidis . yet the best match for r. pomonella contig  <dig> to a gene in the d. melanogaster complete genome was to beta adaptin , at an e value of  <dig> . armadillo repeat-containing-protein  <dig> is a single copy gene in all sequenced insect genomes except for aedes aegyptii . similar results were obtained for contig  <dig>  which matched the cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein locus throughout the animalia, but did not produce a high match within d. melanogaster.

gene gains were also implied; we identified eight transcripts that had not been previously identified as unique to the clade schizophora . for four of these  we found no matching non-schizophoran sequences at all. for the remaining four novel genes , we were able to identify distant ancestors outside the schizophora; some clearly represent new members of multigene families .

our inferences about gene gain and loss are admittedly limited because an est project produces an incomplete sample of a species' genes. for example, we cannot determine whether the absence of a gene in rhagoletis is due to the actual absence of this gene, or to sampling error. however, we can conclude with confidence that a gene has been lost in drosophila when it occurs in rhagoletis and other insects but is missing in the completely sequenced genomes of drosophila melanogaster and relatives. similarly, we can only be certain about whether an apparently drosophila-specific gene was gained prior to the common ancestor of rhagoletis and drosophila, but not about whether it was gained more recently after the drosophilid/tephritid split. even with these sampling limitations, however, gene gain/loss information from transcriptome studies has great potential for resolving the genealogies among rhagoletis, drosophila, and other schizophora.

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptome data reported here will greatly expand our insight into all the areas to which rhagoletis pomonella has contributed: ecological speciation, sympatric speciation, host plant adaptation, and the emergence of new economically important insect pests. the impact of the new data will first be felt in studies of olfaction and diapause-related life history timing, for which this study has provided a wealth of new candidate loci. but the snp and microsatellite markers reported here will also facilitate new work on the population and quantitative genetic studies of divergence between the apple and hawthorn-infesting host races. furthermore, these data will serve as a basis for exploring the molecular genetics of host plant radiation and adaptation more broadly in the closely-related members of the r. pomonella species group, which contains a bevy of host-plant specialists including the economically-important blueberry maggot r. mendax and the newly identified "lonicera fly," an example of hybrid speciation.
