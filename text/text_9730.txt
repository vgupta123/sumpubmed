BACKGROUND
pob1/reps <dig>  was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screening as a partner of ralbp <dig>  <cit> , an effector of the small g protein ral  <cit>  that displays a gap activity towards rac <dig> and cdc <dig>  <cit> . pob <dig> is expressed as two isoforms, the short isoform is  <dig> residues long while the second one differs due to its having a  <dig> amino acid extension at the amino-terminus. the most prominent structural/functional features, which are common to both isoforms, include an amino-terminal eh  domain, a central region containing two adjacent proline-rich regions and a carboxy-terminal portion mediating the binding to ralbp <dig>  via its eh domain, pob <dig> associates with eps <dig> and epsin  <cit> .

the observed interactions with proteins involved in the endocytic pathway and the report that over-expression of the eh domain or the ralbp <dig> binding region inhibits egf and insulin internalization, implicates pob <dig> in receptor endocytosis  <cit> . accordingly, pob <dig> is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to egf in cos cells and co-purifies with activated egf receptor  <cit> . furthermore pob <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with over expressed grb <dig>  and with pag <dig> , a paxillin-associated protein, at endogenous levels. the sequence responsible for this latter interaction was mapped to a proline-rich motif  that binds to the sh <dig> domain of pag <dig>  <cit> .

because of its links to receptor endocytosis and to actin cytoskeleton remodeling, pob <dig> has been proposed as a molecular scaffold recruiting proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and linking them to actin cytoskeleton.

in addition, more recently, it has been reported that loss of pob <dig> expression in prostate cancer cells results in deregulation of growth factor signaling, while an increase of pob <dig> expression has been correlated with silencing of egf signaling. moreover, pob <dig> isoform  <dig> down-regulation has been observed during progression of prostate cancer from androgen to egf dependency  <cit> .

although this scattered information suggest a central role of pob <dig> in the complex regulatory mechanisms modulating growth factor response, no simple model has been put forward to explain all the observations.

in this work, we show that, in addition to the amino-terminal eh domain and the carboxy-terminal ralbp <dig> binding region, a third central area of pob <dig>  containing motifs recognized by the sh <dig> domains of grb <dig> and amphiphysin ii and by the 14-3- <dig> family proteins, plays a role in modulating receptor endocytosis. over-expression of this pob <dig> fragment negatively affects epidermal growth factor receptor endocytosis by titration and delocalization of essential components. conversely, point mutations in the conserved binding motifs eliminate the dominant negative effect on receptor endocytosis. these data provide support for a role of pob <dig> as a regulator of growth factor receptor endocytosis and corroborate its suggested role as a tumor suppressor.

RESULTS
expression of the pob <dig> proline rich region from pro <dig> to vel <dig> inhibits egfr endocytosis
while expression of full-length pob <dig> in a <dig> cells does not affect either binding or internalization of egf, over-expression of either the eh domain or the c-terminal region of pob <dig> affects the ligand dependent internalization pathway of egf and insulin without interfering with the constitutive transferrin pathway  <cit> . we were interested in assessing whether the pob <dig> proline-rich region plays an additional role in the ligand-dependent endocytosis of egfr. to this end, we transiently transfected hela cells with green fluorescent protein  fusion constructs expressing either the pob <dig> isoform  <dig> full length or prd <dig>  the pob <dig> proline rich region from pro <dig> to val <dig> . as controls we performed parallel transfections with two plasmids expressing gfp or gfp-dynamin k44a, a dynamin mutant that is an established inhibitor of both egf and transferrin endocytosis  <cit> . transfected cells were serum starved and subsequently incubated with tritc labeled egf or transferrin to monitor the two internalization pathways. as already reported, the ectopic expression of full length pob <dig> had no influence on transferrin or egf endocytosis  <cit> . similarly, pob <dig> prd <dig>  the construct expressing a pob <dig> fragment from amino acid  <dig> to  <dig>  did not affect the constitutive transferrin endocytic pathway. on the other hand, hela cells over-expressing the pob <dig> prd <dig>  when treated with tritc-egf, have a much reduced number of internalized egf-stained vesicles and show a diffuse fluorescence, resembling dynamin k44a expression, indicating that pob1-prd <dig> over-expression interferes with egf endocytosis, . this phenotype has been observed in five independent experiments with a penetrance of 65% of transfected cells. in similar control experiments, over-expression of dynamin k44a mutant inhibited egf internalization with a penetrance of 75%.

the c-terminal sh <dig> domain of grb <dig> and the sh <dig> domain of amphiphysin ii bind to full-length pob <dig> and to pob <dig> prd <dig> 
to further characterize the interaction network centered on pob <dig>  we sought to isolate proteins binding the proline-rich core region. the pob <dig> central region from pro <dig> to val <dig> was expressed in bacteria as a gst fusion protein , immobilized on glutathione-sepharose and used as a bait for affinity selection of a human brain cdna library displayed on lambda phage  <cit> . the selected phage clones were sequenced and shown to encode either the src homology  <dig> domain  of amphiphysin ii or the carboxy-terminal sh <dig> domain of the molecular adaptor grb <dig>  which was formerly shown to bind tagged pob <dig> in a gst pull-down assay  <cit> .

to support these findings, we prepared a cell extract from hek <dig> cells transfected with a plasmid encoding myc-tagged pob <dig>  the extract was incubated with the two sh <dig> domains of grb <dig>  or the one of amphiphysin ii, expressed as gst fusion proteins. the proteins retained by the affinity resin were separated by sds-page and probed with an anti-myc antibody . full length pob <dig> was only bound by the grb <dig> carboxy-terminal sh <dig> or by the amphiphysin ii sh <dig> domain, whereas the amino-terminal sh <dig> domain of grb <dig> did not retain the myc tagged pob <dig>  in a similar experiment the sh <dig> domains of grb <dig> and amphiphysin ii were able to bind to the full length pob <dig> and to the proline rich domain, prd <dig> region 308– <dig>  of pob <dig>  expressed as gfp fusion proteins in hek <dig> cells .

pob <dig> co-immunoprecipitates in vivo with amphiphysin ii and grb2
in order to assess whether the interactions between pob <dig> and amphiphysin ii or grb <dig> can take place in vivo, we transiently co-transfected hek <dig> cells with pob <dig> fused to gfp, together with either amphiphysin ii-flag or grb2-ha . cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ha  or anti-flag  and the immunoprecipitates were revealed with an anti-gfp antibody . while pob <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with both amphiphysin ii and grb <dig>  none of the control lanes shows any detectable pob <dig> immunoprecipitation.

moreover, ectopically expressed pob1-myc was also found to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous grb <dig> in hek <dig> cells . the co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous pob <dig> full length and endogenous grb <dig> is also detected in hela cells in an egf independent manner .

the interaction of pob <dig> with amphiphysin ii is consistent with the co-localization of pob <dig> with clathrin, since amphiphysin ii is a clathrin ligand  <cit>  . the localization of pob <dig> in hela cells is also not influenced by egf addition .

arg <dig> is an important binding determinant in the motifs recognized by the sh <dig> domains of amphiphysin ii and grb2
to identify the recognition motifs bound by the grb <dig> and the amphiphysin ii sh <dig> domains, we first synthesized, on a cellulose membrane, sixteen overlapping peptides , spanning the pob1-prd <dig> sequence from residue pro <dig> to val <dig>   <cit> . the peptides were then probed with the purified sh <dig> domains of amphiphysin ii and grb <dig>  fused to gst. this approach established the sequence 338pptppprp <dig> as the one binding with the highest affinity both sh <dig> domains . another peptide containing the sequence lkarps binds to the sh <dig> of amphiphysin ii, albeit producing a spot intensity 30% lower than the best binder. next, we systematically mutagenized the pentadecapeptide 338pptppprpqkthsra <dig>  containing the best binding motif as established above, by replacing each residue with an alanine . this approach identified arg <dig> as the main binding determinant for both sh <dig> domains. interestingly, aside from this common main determinant, the binding of the amphiphysin ii sh <dig> domain is more sensitive to substitutions in pro <dig> while the binding of the sh <dig> domain of grb <dig> is affected by substitutions in pro <dig> and pro <dig>  this suggests that the two domains bind the same sequence but in a different mode. to validate arg344's essential role in the interaction between pob <dig> and the sh <dig> domains of amphiphysin ii and grb <dig>  we constructed a variant of the gfp-prd <dig>  encoding a prd <dig> fragment in which ala replaces arg <dig> . this pob <dig> construct was transiently transfected into hek <dig> cells and cell lysates were incubated with gst-amphiphysin ii sh <dig> or gst-grb <dig> carboxy-terminal sh <dig>  as shown in fig. 3c, the amphiphysin ii sh <dig> domain binds both to gfp-prd <dig> and to gfp-prd <dig> r344a. however, the recovery of gfp-prd <dig> r344a is less efficient, confirming that the mutation arg344ala affects this interaction. the grb <dig> carboxy-terminal sh <dig> domain, on the other hand, does not bind gfp-pob <dig> prd <dig> arg344ala at all.

these results map the target of the sh <dig> domain of amphiphysin and the carboxy-terminal sh <dig> of grb <dig> to a short peptide flanking arg <dig> in pob <dig> 

endogenous 14-3- <dig> isoforms bind to the pob <dig> prd <dig> region in a phosphorylation dependent manner
upon sequence examination by elm  search, pob <dig> contains three putative 14-3- <dig> binding sites centered on ser <dig>  ser <dig> and ser <dig> . in order to validate this prediction, we performed pull-down experiments using, as baits, four members of the human 14-3- <dig> family fused to gst. all the 14-3- <dig> isoforms that we have tested  were able to bind with comparable affinities to a pob1-gfp full-length chimera over-expressed in hek <dig> cells . it should be noted that 14-3- <dig> proteins seem to enrich for a slower migrating band, probably a phosphorylated form of pob <dig> 

in order to better define the pob <dig> region involved in the interaction, we engineered a series of plasmids directing the synthesis of deletion mutants of the pob <dig> protein: pob <dig> 126– <dig> contains the eh domain, pob <dig> 308– <dig> encompasses the first poly-proline region, prd <dig>  pob <dig> 308– <dig> comprises two adjacent proline rich regions while pob <dig> 308– <dig> further extends to the carboxy-terminal region including the ralbp <dig> binding domain . the pull down experiment in figure 4b confirms the interaction of 14-3- <dig> with the carboxy-terminal portion of pob <dig>  and restricts the minimal essential binding site to the prd <dig> region of pob <dig>  including both ser <dig> and ser <dig> 

in order to assess whether pob <dig> binds to endogenous 14-3- <dig>  we transiently transfected hek <dig> cells with myc-pob <dig> in two independent experimental repeats . cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibodies  while the co-immunoprecipitated endogenous 14-3- <dig> proteins were detected with specific antibodies. the results in figure 4d, upper panel, show that endogenous 14-3- <dig> proteins, including the largest isoform , co-immunoprecipitate with pob <dig> 

since most 14-3- <dig> interactions are phosphorylation dependent  <cit> we tested whether the interaction between 14-3- <dig> and pob <dig> prd <dig> is mediated by a phospho-peptide. we performed a pull down experiment as described in fig. 4b after incubating half of the cell extract with λ-phosphatase, active towards phosphorylated serine and threonine . when treated with phosphatase, neither the full length pob <dig>  nor the pob <dig> prd <dig> region  is efficiently recovered by 14-3- <dig>  the same absence of co-immunoprecipitation occurred after wortmannin treatment suggesting an involvement of akt ser/thr kinase .

taken together, these results suggest that the interaction between pob <dig> and the 14-3- <dig> proteins can occur in vivo, the recognized motif is encompassed in the region 308– <dig> of pob <dig> and the binding is ser/thr phosphorylation dependent.

coimmunoprecipitation of pob <dig> with the isoform ζ is observed also at endogenous levels in hela cells .

characterization of the 14-3- <dig> binding site: ser354
as a means to map the 14-3- <dig> binding site, we have first fragmented the pob <dig> prd <dig> region  into fifteen amino acid long overlapping peptides synthesized on a cellulose membrane . since 14-3- <dig> proteins preferentially bind motifs containing phosphorylated serines or threonines, we have synthesized in parallel all of the prd <dig> region's  <dig> mers containing a central serine or a threonine . these peptides were synthesized both in the phosphorylated  and in the unphosphorylated forms . fig. 5a shows the results obtained by probing the corresponding peptide array, with the human 14-3- <dig> sigma isoform . among the pob <dig> peptides the one showing the strongest signal  is 347kthsraspsldlnkvf <dig> , although its sequence does not match a typical class  <dig> or class  <dig> 14-3- <dig> consensus  <cit> . similar results were obtained by probing comparable membranes with the zeta isoform . this result identifies the phospho-ser <dig> as an important determinant in the 14-3- <dig> binding site and confirms the requirement for a phosphorylated serine since the same peptide, in the un-phosphorylated form, does not bind 14-3- <dig> . the second predicted 14-3- <dig> binding site, flanking ser <dig>  binds 14-3- <dig> much less tightly when compared with ser <dig> 

to confirm the functional relevance of the 14-3- <dig> binding site characterized in vitro, we transiently co-transfected hek <dig> cells with 3xflag-14-3- <dig> isoform zeta and pob1-gfp, bearing mutations in ser <dig> and in ser <dig>  the two serines are within two sequences resembling 14-3- <dig> type  <dig> motifs  and are predicted 14-3- <dig> ligands by the motif scan software at scansite.mit.edu. however, since the phospho-peptide centered on ser <dig> did not bind 14-3- <dig> in the membrane-binding assay, we focused on the ser <dig> motif by constructing ser354ala and ser354asp mutants. in addition, we also constructed double mutants by mutating ser  <dig> . cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibodies  and the co-immunoprecipitated pob <dig> was revealed with anti-gfp antibodies. as shown in the upper panel , wild type pob <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with 14-3- <dig> , while, substituting ser <dig> with ala  is sufficient to abolish binding. replacing ser <dig> with a negatively charged residue, aspartate, cannot mimic the 14-3- <dig> binding motif . these results prove that phosphorylation of ser <dig> in pob <dig> dictates 14-3- <dig> binding. the substitution of ser <dig> with aspartate does not recapitulate binding, as often seen in 14-3- <dig> interactions with phosphorylated substrates, as, for example, rgs or keratin  <cit> . these data show that mutation of ser <dig> in pob <dig> abolishes interaction with 14-3- <dig> 

mutations affecting pob <dig> prd <dig> binding to sh <dig> or 14-3- <dig> suppress the dominant negative phenotype
to correlate binding to function, we decided to ask if the expression of pob <dig> prd <dig> mutated in the sh <dig> and the 14-3- <dig> binding motifs is able to affect egf induced receptor endocytosis.

in contrast with its wild type counterpart , the over-expression of gfp-pob <dig> prd <dig> s354a, mutated in the serine residue that dictates 14-3- <dig> binding, does not affect endocytosis. . also, cells over expressing pob <dig> prd <dig> r344a, which is defective in binding to amphiphysin ii and grb <dig> sh <dig>  do not show any interference in the wild type egf internalization . these results demonstrate that the pob <dig> proline-rich region acts as a dominant negative for egf internalization and that this negative effect can be rescued by mutations in the residues that affect binding to 14-3- <dig> or to specific sh <dig> 

interestingly, the normal phenotype of endocytosis is restored upon co-transfection of the wild type pob <dig> prd <dig> region with 3xflag-14-3- <dig> ζ in over-expression . we conclude that over-expression of 14-3- <dig> ζ removes the endocytosis block caused by the dominant negative effect of the prd <dig> region of pob <dig> 

discussion
the observation that over-expression of the eh domain or of the carboxy-terminal ralbp <dig> binding region of pob1/reps <dig> results in a 30–40% reduction of egf or insulin internalization has linked pob <dig> to the molecular machinery modulating regulated endocytosis  <cit> . more recently, it was reported that loss of pob <dig> expression during human prostate cancer progression, from androgen-dependent to growth factors dependent, results in loss of control of cell growth signaling while induced expression of pob <dig> causes a reduction of several egf-responsive genes . in accordance, we find that an increase of pob <dig> isoform  <dig> expression correlates with a decrease of egf-induced phosphorylation of erk1– <dig> and shc . moreover, pob <dig> isoform  <dig> down-regulation was observed during the progression of prostate cancer  <cit> .

in our study we confirm the involvement of pob <dig> in egf receptor endocytosis and we provide evidence for a functional role of the central proline-rich region. in fact, we observed that over-expression of the proline-rich region of pob <dig>  interferes with egfr endocytosis while leaving transferrin uptake unaffected . this suggests that, in addition to the n and c-terminal regions, the central proline-rich domain  of pob <dig>  from pro <dig> to val <dig>  also plays an important function in regulated endocytosis and that over-expression of this portion of pob <dig> disturbs the dynamics of protein interactions by titration of elements required for regulated endocytosis.

by panning phage displayed cdna libraries, with a pob <dig> construct containing the proline-rich domain prd <dig>  we enriched for phages displaying the carboxy-terminal sh <dig> domain of grb <dig> and the sh <dig> domain of amphiphysin ii. these in vitro identified physical interactions were further confirmed in vivo, with full length pob <dig> . a complex between pob <dig> and grb <dig> has already been reported  <cit> , we add that pob <dig> can bind grb <dig> at endogenous levels  and we report that the interaction occurs by means of the carboxy-terminal sh <dig> domain of grb <dig>  interestingly the grb <dig> binding motif in pob <dig>  is exactly conserved in the gab motif  that is also recognized by grb <dig>  this motif is also conserved in the highly homologous human protein reps <dig>  pob <dig> shows a punctate cytoplasmic localization that is not much affected by egf induction . a substantial fraction of pob <dig> co-stains with the late endosome markers cd <dig> or lamp- <dig>  as also found for tyrosine-phosphorylated egfr, shc, cbl and grb <dig>  <cit> .

we describe amphiphysin ii as a new pob <dig> interactor. pob <dig> cellular colocalization with clathrin is consistent with this interaction, since amphiphysin ii is also a clathrin ligand  . by alanine scanning mutagenesis we have shown that both grb <dig> and amphiphysin ii sh <dig> bind to the same pob <dig> peptide, however, different residues seem to be the main determinants of recognition specificity. amphiphysin ii binding is affected by changes in arg <dig> and pro <dig> while grb <dig> binding is sensitive to changes in pro <dig> and pro  <dig> .

we have characterized a second linear motif of pob <dig> containing a phosphorylated serine and mediating binding to the 14-3- <dig> isoforms . this binding site was mapped approximately ten amino acids away from the sh <dig> binding motif . 14-3- <dig> binding was shown to be sensitive to phosphatase treatment  and binding was abolished when ser <dig> was mutated to ala or to asp . this suggests that pob <dig> binds 14-3- <dig> in a phosphorylated form. significantly, the characterized pob <dig> peptide sequence hsrassldlnk, only displays poor similarity to the classical 14-3- <dig> binding motifs  <cit> . in fact, while presenting the conserved arg at position - <dig> from the phosphorylated serine, it displays a few uncommon features, such as an asp at position + <dig>  in place of the preferred pro. this divergence is not anomalous, given that physiological substrates often bind 14-3- <dig> through peptide ligands which do not exactly match the most common motifs  <cit> . interestingly binding is abolished if ser <dig>  immediately preceding the phosphorylated ser <dig>  is also phosphorylated . 14-3- <dig> have been described as forming complexes with more than  <dig> partners in high throughput studies and potentially engaging  <dig> % of the human proteome  <cit> . some of these complexes have been implicated in regulating protein membrane trafficking. for instance, 14-3- <dig> were shown to reduce endoplasmic reticulum  localization, thereby promoting surface expression of membrane proteins  <cit> .

it has to be emphasized that 14-3- <dig> zeta has already been reported as associating with the epidermal growth factor receptor cytoplasmic tail and co-localizing along the plasma membrane with egfr upon egf stimulation  <cit> . thus a 14-3- <dig> dimer could bridge pob <dig> to the egfr upon egf induction. similarly, 14-3- <dig> proteins appear to be the essential molecular bridge between the alfa1-subunit of the na+, k+, -atpase in the plasma membrane and the pi 3-kinase, thus providing the signal to initiate endocytosis of the protein in response to natriuretic hormones  <cit> . finally 14-3- <dig> sigma is phosphorylated in prostate cells in response to egf  <cit> . it is interesting to note that the 14-3- <dig> binding motif hsrxssld flanking ser <dig> of pob <dig>  that we find essential for interaction with 14-3- <dig>  is conserved in the mouse orthologs and flanks the ser <dig> of human reps <dig>  that is found phosphorylated in vivo in a <dig> cells . this serine site is predicted to be phosphorylated by akt or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii gamma, camk2g. in agreement, we observed absence of 14-3-3-coimmunoprecipitated pob <dig> when cells where treated with phosphatase or wortmannin , an inhibitor of pi3k and consequently of akt.

to further test the model we assayed the pob <dig> proline-rich construct harboring the point mutation r344a, which prevents binding of grb <dig> and amphiphysin ii and, as expected, we did not observe the dominant negative effect on egfr internalization . thus, the arg344ala mutation both affects the formation of the pob1/grb <dig> and pob1/amphiphysin ii complexes and also abolishes the dominant negative phenotype affecting endocytosis. this suggests that titration of either sh <dig> containing partner affects egfr internalization. similarly, a pob <dig> prd <dig> construct whose ability to bind 14-3- <dig> was impaired by a ser354ala mutation, was unable to inhibit endocytosis in over-expression conditions . in addition, we have found that co-expression of 14-3- <dig> relieves the dominant negative effect of pob1-prd <dig> on egfr internalization . mechanistically, 14-3- <dig> ζ could offset the negative pob1-prd <dig> over-expression effect, by binding pob1-prd <dig> and by preventing the recruitment and trapping of a second essential physiological ligand.

CONCLUSIONS
we confirm that pob <dig> plays an active role in controlling the dynamics of ligand-dependent receptor internalization and signaling. this is mediated by several interactions with diverse protein partners  <cit> . in this work, we provide evidence of the central role played by the proline rich region of pob <dig> through binding to 14-3- <dig> and to the sh <dig> of grb <dig> and amphyphisin ii . we observe that these interactions are not egf dependent and are probably exclusive, since the binding motifs are only nine amino acid apart.

the artificial over-expression of this portion of pob <dig> affects endocytosis by titration of essential components, leading to formation of partial complexes that are not functional  <cit> . thus pob <dig> acts as a sort of scaffold to enucleate a complex that is required for receptor internalization. the assembly and composition of this complex is finely regulated by protein concentration. besides contributing to expanding and further characterizing the functional endocytosis "interactome", these results add to the molecular interpretation of pob <dig> as a tumor suppressor, due to its acting as a scaffold to bridge proteins which are established promoters of endocytosis and, subsequently, of receptor down regulation.
