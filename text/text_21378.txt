BACKGROUND
several important proteins, such fibroblast growth factor  <dig> , fgf <dig>  and interleukin-1β  are secreted from cells by alternative pathways collectively termed nonclassical  secretory pathways  <cit> . nonclassical secretory proteins are not synthesized as precursors with an n-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence, which is common to classical secretory proteins, and they are not glycosylated. they do not use the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus as conduits to the cell surface and their secretion is resistant to brefeldin a , a potent inhibitor of the classical secretory pathway.

four nonclassical protein secretory pathways have been described . they include 1) direct transport of proteins from the cytosol across the plasma membrane presumably through membrane transporters, 2) lysosomal secretion, 3) export via exosomes derived from multivesicular bodies, and 4) packaging of proteins into plasma membrane vesicles . in addition, cytosolic proteins can exit cells damaged by mechanical means, such as scraping and needle puncture  <cit> . although fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> can be secreted directly through the plasma membrane, the dependence of fgf <dig>  but not fgf <dig>  secretion on heat shock suggests they are secreted by different mechanisms  <cit> . some proteins can leave by more than one pathway depending on cell type or experimental conditions. for example, il-1β can be exported in secretory lysosomes  <cit> , blebs  <cit> , exosomes  <cit> , or directly through the plasma membrane by unknown transporters  <cit> .

in experiments described in this report, an established nonclassical secretory protein, phosphoglycerate kinase  <dig> , was used to gain insight into the mechanism of nonclassical protein secretion. pgk <dig> is the sixth enzyme in glycolysis catalyzing the conversion of  <dig>  bisphosphoglycerate into 3-phosphoglycerate and yielding atp. extracellular pgk <dig> acts as a disulphide reductase in an enzymatic cascade generating angiostatin from plasmin  <cit> . pgk <dig> is an abundant cytosolic protein and its biochemical and structural properties are well established rendering it an excellent model protein to study nonclassical protein secretion  <cit> . in contrast, many nonclassically secreted proteins, such as fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  are found in trace amounts in cells necessitating their overexpression for analysis.

pgk <dig> can be released from a variety of cells including hela  <cit> . it is reported here that pgk <dig> can be rapidly released from hela cells by lowering the colloidal osmotic pressure  of the media, a procedure routinely used in cell biology when cells are washed with isoosmotic solutions, such as serum-free media or phosphate buffered saline . pgk <dig> exits at discreet sites of disrupted plasma membrane  without catastrophic cell loss. this process is termed oncotic release.

RESULTS
pgk <dig> as reporter for nonclassical secretion
hogg and coworkers previously demonstrated that pgk <dig> can be released from a variety of cells lines including ht <dig> cells  <cit> . pgk <dig> is an excellent model protein to study nonclassical protein secretion because it is abundant and has several hallmarks of nonclassically secreted proteins. an elisa assay was used to quantify intracellular and extracellular pools of pgk <dig>  <cit> . immunoblots indicated that pgk <dig> in both pools is very stable with negligible fragmentation . hela cells were used as a model system, because they are routinely used in the laboratory and the amount of pgk <dig> released from them  <cit>  and ht <dig> cells  <cit>  were comparable.

cell density affects pgk <dig> release
during the optimization of the pgk <dig> release assay it was noticed that release was less efficient in more confluent cultures. to determine the effect of cell density on pgk <dig> release hela cells were plated at different densities, allowed to grow for  <dig> h, and then the amount of pgk <dig> released into serum-free media during a 2-h incubation was measured. although pgk <dig> was released at all cell densities tested, the efficiency of release on a per cell basis was maximal at  <dig>  cells/well . this result suggested that cell-cell interactions attenuate pgk <dig> release and established  <dig>  cells/well  as the optimal cell density for the experiments.

time course of pgk <dig> release
to gain insight into the release process, the time course of pgk <dig> release from hela cells into serum-free medium was measured . ldh activity was measured to monitor cytotoxicity. although pgk <dig> and ldh were released from cells in two phases: a rapid early phase  and a slow later phase , the extent of release was different. about  <dig> % of the amount of cellular pgk <dig> at the beginning of the experiment was detected in the media by  <dig>  min. by  <dig> min, the amount of pgk <dig> in the media decreased to about 4% . in the slow second phase, the amount of pgk in the media gradually increased from 4% to about 7% . in contrast, about 16% of the amount of ldh in the cell at the beginning of the experiment was released by  <dig>  min and this amount decreased to 12% by  <dig> min . the amount of ldh in the media then increased slightly to 13%  by  <dig> min. these results suggest that pgk <dig> and ldh can be released rapidly into serum-free media and that some of the extracellular pgk <dig> and ldh can be degraded or rendered undetectable to their respective assays.

interestingly, the amount of pgk detected in the media did not equal the amount of pgk <dig> lost from the cell . the amount of cellular pgk <dig> rapidly decreased to 60% of the original concentration during the first  <dig> min and then gradually decreased to 40% by  <dig> min . the sudden decrease in the amount of pgk <dig> in the cell may result from its rapid release, degradation within the cell, or both upon shifting the cells into serum-free media. in contrast, the amount of ldh in the cell decreased to 75% of the original amount by  <dig>  min . by  <dig> min, the cellular ldh concentration recovered to about 85%  of the original amount suggesting that some ldh was reabsorbed or replenished by the cell. the concentration of ldh in the cell, in contrast to that of pgk <dig>  was relatively constant at about 80% of the original amount between  <dig> and  <dig> min.

to test the possibility that pgk <dig> and ldh release accompanied catastrophic cell loss, the number of cells  remaining after transferring them into serum-free media was measured . the number of cells remained essentially unchanged after  <dig> h, a point at which the cellular concentration of pgk <dig> and ldh decreased, respectively, by 40% and 20%. in contrast, 75% of cells were lost after treating them with water presumably due to hypoosmotic swelling and lysis. this result supports the idea that catastrophic cell loss does not accompany pgk <dig> and ldh release.

vesicle-independent release of pgk1
some nonclassically secreted proteins are packaged into vesicles before or during their release from cells. for example, galectin  <dig> has been localized in membrane blebs  <cit>  and under certain conditions il-1β  <cit>  can be found in exosomes. to test the hypothesis that pgk <dig> is released in vesicles a protease protection assay was performed . in this assay, a protein is protected from exogenously added protease if it is contained within a membrane vesicle. released pgk <dig> was completely digested with proteinase k in the presence  or absence  of a triton x- <dig>  untreated pgk <dig> was stable in the presence  or absence  of the detergent. together these results indicate that pgk <dig> is released as a free soluble protein and not protected within a vesicle.

effect of various inhibitors on pgk <dig> release
to test the hypothesis that pgk <dig> is released through a nonclassical secretory pathway its release in the presence of brefeldin a  or exo <dig> was monitored. bfa blocks the classical secretory pathway by inhibiting arf <dig>  a gtp-binding protein required to initiate bud formation . although the mechanism by which exo <dig> inhibits the classical secretory pathway is not completely understood, it likely interferes with the formation of arf1-containing complexes involved in er to golgi transport  <cit> . bfa inhibited pgk <dig> and ldh release by  <dig> and 20%, respectively . in contrast, the secretion of prolactin, which is a protein that passes through the classical secretory pathway, was blocked greater than 90% in the presence of bfa . interestingly, exo <dig> did not significantly affect pgk <dig> or ldh release . together these results suggest that pgk <dig> and ldh release are similar and that the classical secretory pathway has a minor role in their release.

ns, no significant change

atp binding cassette  transporters have been shown to play a role in the nonclassical secretion of il-1β  <cit> . glyburide, an inhibitor of the abc <dig> transporter, was used to probe its contribution, if any, to pgk <dig> release. glyburide inhibited pgk <dig> and ldh release by  <dig> and 20%, respectively, suggesting that abc transporters contribute fractionally to their release .

cytochalasin d, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, inhibited pgk <dig> and ldh release by  <dig> and 37%, respectively . similarly, nocodazole, an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, inhibited pgk <dig> and ldh release by  <dig> and 34%, respectively . together these results support the idea that pgk <dig> and ldh are released from cells by a pathway dependent, in part, on the actin and microtubule components of the cytoskeleton.

the effects of other inhibitors of nonclassical secretory pathways were also examined . the inhibitors included methylamine , ouabain , calcimycin , and egta . in each case, the inhibition of pgk <dig> release was either negligible or may have resulted from the inhibitor-induced loss of cytosolic pgk <dig> .

serum or bsa blocks pgk <dig> release
serum was previously shown to affect the secretion of some nonclassically secreted proteins. for example, serum withdrawal stimulated secretion of fgf <dig>  <cit>  and hiv- <dig> tat protein  <cit> , but inhibited secretion of fgf <dig>  <cit>  and il-1β  <cit> . to gain insight into the role of serum in regulating pgk <dig> release the amount of pgk <dig> released at different concentrations of serum was measured. the amount of pgk <dig> released was inversely proportional to serum concentration . this result indicated that serum attenuates pgk <dig> release and suggests that the release pathways of fgf <dig>  <cit> , tat  <cit>  and pgk <dig> are, in part, similar.

the findings thus far demonstrate that pgk <dig> is rapidly released from cells through a process stimulated by serum withdrawal. two possible explanations for serum regulation of nonclassical secretion were considered. first, the loss of growth factors or cytokines accompanying the shift to serum-free conditions might act as a specific signal for secretion. second, the loss of total protein from media might act nonspecifically to promote secretion. to distinguish these two possibilities, the effect of different concentrations of bsa on pgk <dig> release was measured. bsa, like serum, attenuated pgk <dig> release . interestingly the lowest concentration of bsa required to block pgk <dig> release was  <dig> mg/ml - about the same concentration as that of total protein in the culture medium . this result supports the idea that changing the total protein concentration in the media influences pgk <dig> release.

confocal microscopy of pgk <dig> release
the results suggest that transferring hela cells into serum-free media induces the rapid release of pgk <dig>  to identify the site of pgk release the appearance of pgk <dig> on the cell surface upon shifting cells into serum-free media was monitored using confocal microscopy. to detect pgk <dig> appearing only on the cell surface the cells were not permeabilized with detergent. plumes of pgk <dig> were detected on the surface of cells transferred into serum-free media . in contrast, the amount of pgk <dig> released from untreated cells  or cells transferred into serum-free media containing bsa  was negligible. these results support the idea that pgk <dig> is released from intact cells at one or more sites.

entry of a membrane impermeable probe under serum-free conditions
sytox green, which is a membrane impermeable fluorescent dye, was used to test the possibility that sites of pgk <dig> release may permit entry of material into the cell. hela cells were incubated for  <dig> min with sytox green in serum-free or bsa-containing media and the amount of cell-associated fluorescence was measured. about 11-fold more fluorescence was associated with cells incubated with serum-free media than with bsa-containing media . this result is consistent with the idea that transient sites on the plasma membrane open in response to the acute decrease in extracellular protein concentration allowing cellular components, such as pgk <dig>  to escape and other reagents, such as sytox green, to enter.

discussion
in this study pgk <dig> was used to investigate mechanisms of nonclassical protein secretion. at least  <dig> models of nonclassical secretion have been proposed including 1) direct passage through a membrane transporter, 2) lysosomal secretion, 3) secretion in exosomes, and 4) blebbing . in addition, mechanically wounding the plasma membrane by scraping can release cytosolic proteins, such as fgf <dig>  <cit> .

the results presented herein lead to a working model of protein release in which nonlethal oncotic pores or microruptures are formed in the plasma membrane in response to the change in colloidal osmotic pressure upon serum withdrawal allowing the release of pgk <dig>  before the pores are rapidly resealed.

central to the working model of protein release through oncotic pores are the findings that pgk <dig> release was induced by serum withdrawal and that bsa prevented it. this suggests that its release is triggered by the change in colloidal osmotic pressure  instead of a specific factor present in serum. changes in osmolarity of cell culture media have been demonstrated to alter cell morphology . for example, hyperosmolar solutions shrink cells and hypoosmolar solutions swell cells. the possibility that serum was affecting the osmolarity of the media was excluded by the finding that mem with or without 10% newborn calf serum had an osmolarity of  <dig> ±  <dig> mosm. protein solutions, however, have a colligative property that can create a potential energy difference across a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membrane  <cit> . this energy difference is termed oncotic pressure or colloidal osmotic pressure  <cit> .

in addition to pgk <dig>  several nonclassically secreted proteins, such as fgf <dig>  <cit> , s100a <dig>  <cit> , tat  <cit> , and galectin  <dig>  <cit> , are released from cells upon serum withdrawal. a mutated version of rhodanese, which lacked its mitochondrial targeting sequence, was rapidly released from hek <dig> cells upon serum withdrawal without any appreciable cell death  <cit> . thus, withdrawing or lowering the concentration of serum in media can induce the release of certain proteins by incompletely understood mechanisms.

on the other hand, nonclassical secretory proteins, such as l- <dig> lectin   <cit>  and fgf <dig>  under certain conditions  <cit> , can be secreted in the presence of serum. an early report  <cit>  showed fgf <dig> was released from endothelial cells into serum-free conditioned media while another  <cit>  showed fgf <dig> secretion from nih 3t <dig> cells required serum and serum-free conditions blocked its secretion. raising the concentration of fetal bovine serum increased the secretion of fgf <dig> from aids-ks cells  <cit> . brooks et al.  <cit>  showed that fgf <dig> can be released from bovine retinal endothelial cells in the presence or absence of serum. release correlated with cell damage but only after prolonged incubation ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> h  <cit> . these disparate findings likely represent the ability of fgf <dig> to exit cells by different routes under different experimental conditions.

the above working model of protein release through oncotic pores is consistent with the time course of pgk <dig> release, cell viability during release, and the effect of cell density on release. the rapid release of pgk <dig> during the first  <dig> min may reflect the formation of the pores/microruptures, whereas the attenuation of release may reflect the resealing of the membrane. catastrophic cell loss did not accompany the release of pgk <dig> during the formation and subsequent resealing of the plasma membrane. pgk <dig> release was more efficient at low cell density suggesting that fewer intercellular contacts or more exposed cell surface promote oncotic release.

a variety of inhibitors of classical and nonclassical secretion was used to gain insight into the mechanism of pgk <dig> release. resistance of a protein's secretion to inhibitors of the classical secretory pathway, such as bfa, is the hallmark of nonclassical protein secretion  <cit> . the effect of bfa and exo <dig> on pgk <dig> release was complex - bfa inhibited release by 27%, whereas exo <dig> had no significant effect. a comparison of the mechanism of inhibition of bfa and exo <dig> suggests that exo1's effects may be more localized to the golgi apparatus, whereas those of bfa may be pleiotropic  <cit> . for example, bfa, but not exo <dig>  induces tubulation and collapse of the trans golgi network and endosomes  <cit> . and, bfa promotes the release of broader spectrum of proteins from the golgi than does exo <dig>  <cit> . finally, bfa, but not exo <dig>  induces the inhibition of ctbp/bars <dig>  which catalyzes the transfer of palmitate from palmitoyl coa to lysophosphatidic acid and regulates fission of vesicles from the tgn and plasma membrane  <cit> . perhaps inhibiting ctbp/bars <dig> influences plasma membrane integrity thereby limiting pgk <dig> and ldh release during oncotic challenge.

the mechanism by which abc transporters promote nonclassical protein secretion remains unknown, however, others have suggested they directly transport proteins through their channels or indirectly affect transport during "flipping" of phosphatidylserine  <cit> . the partial inhibition of pgk <dig> release by glyburide raises the possibility that the ion transport activity of some abc transporters contributes to oncotic damage by allowing cells to swell and oncotic pores/microruptures to form during serum-withdrawal. glyburide may inhibit pgk <dig> release by reducing abc transporter-dependent swelling. indeed, glyburide has been used to reduce swelling in cerebral edema by inhibiting a nonselective cation channel  <cit> .

cytochalasin d and nocodazole inhibited pgk <dig> and ldh release by 30-40%  suggesting their release, in part, relies on actin and microtubules. the actin cytoskeleton has been shown to contribute to the nonclassical secretion of fgf <dig>  <cit>  and sphingosine kinase  <cit> . the microtubule network contributes to galectin  <dig> nonclassical secretion  <cit> . walsh et al.  <cit>  showed that pgk <dig>  ldh and other proteins associate with microtubules. thus it is possible that the cytoskeleton aids the trafficking or localization of some nonclassically secreted proteins and pgk <dig> to the plasma membrane and oncotic pores.

the above working model of protein release through oncotic pores accommodates features of nonclassically secreted proteins not addressed directly in this study, such as conformation, charge, and diffusion-limited release. passage through a large oncotic pore/microrupture would obviate the necessity of protein unfolding during transport. indeed, neither fgf <dig>  <cit>  nor fgf <dig>  <cit>  unfold during secretion. the model offers an explanation for the observation that many, but not all, nonclassically secreted proteins have basic isoelectric points. for example, galectin- <dig>  thioredoxin, fgf <dig>  ldh-a, and pgk <dig> have pis of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. fgf1's pi is  <dig> , but its secretion is dependent on its interaction with s100a <dig>  <cit> , which has a pi of  <dig> . a protein's basic isoelectric point may facilitate its interaction with the negatively charged phospholipids of the inner leaflet on the plasma membrane before and during passage through oncotic pores. in addition, the oncotic potential generated by negatively charged serum proteins, such as albumin , might draw positively charged cytosolic proteins towards the membrane. lastly, secretion of some nonclassically secreted proteins, such as fgf <dig>  either by mechanical injury to the cell membrane  <cit>  or by other routes  <cit>  is diffusion controlled. passage through an oncotic pore/microrupture would likely be rapid.

although pgk <dig> can be released through oncotic pores, the possibility remains that it can be released through other routes depending on conditions or cell type. for example, il-1β can leave cells by plasma membrane shedding, in exosomes derived from multivesicular bodies, or through lysosomal secretion  <cit> . and fgf <dig> can be released in vesicles shed from cells  <cit>  or directly through the plasma membrane  <cit> .

release of proteins through oncotic pores and subsequent membrane repair may occur in pathophysiological conditions such as edema, ischemia, and inflammation during which oncotic pressure can change. the presence of pgk <dig> in serum may serve as an early indicator of plasma membrane damage. in experimental cell biology, cytosolic proteins may escape through cell membranes damaged by mechanical scraping  <cit>  and, as demonstrated herein, through oncotic pores when cells or tissues are gently washed with laboratory buffers, such as pbs, or with isoosmotic serum-free media.

CONCLUSIONS
oncotic release was identified as novel nonclassical secretory pathway in which cytosolic proteins exit cells through transient nonlethal oncotic pores in the plasma membrane that form in response to the change in colloidal osmotic pressure upon serum withdrawal.
