BACKGROUND
azadirachta indica a. juss  is an evergreen tree native to the indian subcontinent
 <cit>  belonging to the family meliaceae and order rutales. the neem tree is extensively studied for its natural products. neem oil and its limonoids such as azadirachtin, nimbin, salannin among others are of substantial economic value due to their wide array of applications in agriculture
 <cit> , healthcare
 <cit>  and soil conservation
 <cit> . azadirachtin, isolated half a century ago, has been intensively studied and its commercial formulations have been found to be toxic against a large range of insect species, whilst retaining very low mammalian toxicity
 <cit> . recent success in the total synthesis of azadirachtin
 <cit>  has renewed interest towards its commercial exploitation. neem-derived azadirachtin and other limonoids are also used as anti-proliferative
 <cit> , cytotoxic
 <cit> , larvicidal
 <cit> , and anti-inflammatory
 <cit>  agents, suggesting the need for better understanding of molecular pathways involved in their synthesis.

in spite of the varied uses of azadirachtin and other neem-derived limonoids, a modern agro-chemical and/or pharmaceutical program focusing on understanding their molecular mechanism of action is yet to be established. a better understanding of the biology of differentiation of secretory cells known to harbor azadirachtin and other triterpenoids
 <cit>  may permit development of varieties with higher percentage of these cells in the cotyledons. this information may also be exploited in stalling or delaying further differentiation of these cells to permit greater accumulation of the terpenoids of interest. the elucidation of complete pathways leading to terpenoid biosynthesis and expression of genes involved in such pathways in a. indica will pave ways towards development of newer terpenoid-based biotechnological applications.

de novo sequencing and assembly of the transcriptome from a. indica fruit was reported previously
 <cit> . this report extends the earlier study to cover the whole genome and transcriptomes from root, leaf, stem and flower of neem. comparative genomics among the meliaceae family members will be enabled and, cheaper and environment friendly biopesticides may result using results presented in this study.

RESULTS
genome assembly and similarity with other plant genomes
sequencing libraries generated using multiple platforms and chemistries were tested to assemble the neem genome and transcriptomes . various combinations of sequencing libraries were used to obtain the best scaffold n50s and n90s using soapdenovo
 <cit> . the scheme for a. indica genome assembly is given in figure
1a. the de novo assembly of a. indica genome produced a scaffold n <dig> length of  <dig>  bp with corresponding scaffold n <dig> length of  <dig>  bp, contig n <dig> length of  <dig> bp and contig n <dig> length of  <dig> bp. the genome size of neem was determined to be  <dig> mbp using the kmer frequency plot  representing 95% of the total published genome size
 <cit> . chargaff's symmetry rule was applied for assessing the quality of the genome assembly
 <cit>  by comparing the symmetry of 4-mers between the a. indica scaffolds and the arabidopsis thaliana  genome. there was a tighter distribution of symmetry in a. indica at around  <dig>   compared to the a. thaliana suggesting good assembly results. genome scaffolds  mapping with citrus sinensis  and citrus clementina  showed conserved macrosynteny between neem and citrus  but not with chromosomes from a thaliana, oryza sativa , theobroma cacao , vitis vinifera , ricinus communis  and sorghum bicolor  . in a. indica,  <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds  out of a total of  <dig> scaffolds  mapped to c. sinensis and c. clementina genome scaffolds , respectively, with an expect value of zero. phylogenetic bootstrap analysis
 <cit>  corroborated the taxonomic closeness of a. indica to c. sinensis, as indicated by 100% bootstrap value using rbcl and rbcs . phylogenetic analysis within the meliaceae family grouped a. indica with owenia and melia sp. with a 100% bootstrap value . like a. indica, melia azadirach is known to bear bioactive limonoids
 <cit>  suggesting a common evolutionary trajectory with regard to synthesis of these compounds.

the respective assembly statistics are summarized from various sequencing libraries using  soapdenovo
 <cit>  for the genome and  trinity
 <cit>  for the transcriptomes. various annotation statistics for genes, exons and introns are also provided .
 <cit> . for intra-family phylogeny, rbcl sequences were bootstrapped . phylogenies for each replicate was reconstructed using the 'dnaml' option in phylip, after choosing either chlamydomonas reinhardtii  or citrus sinensis  as outgroups. the consensus phylogeny with bootstrap values highlighting the branch support was plotted using 'consense' and 'drawgram' options in phylip.

repeat analyses
repeat modeler 
 <cit>  and repeat masker 
 <cit>  were used to determine the de novo repeats and to perform homology-based repeat analysis respectively among a. indica genome repeats. for repeat analysis, we used consensus repeat libraries  <cit>  and s. bicolor  <cit> ), in-built plant specific libraries, repbase
 <cit>  and the de novo neem repeat library constructed using repeat modeler. in addition, ltr-finder
 <cit> , transposonpsi
 <cit>  and mite-hunter
 <cit>  were used to study repeats in the a. indica genome. the neem genome was found to harbour fewer repeat elements compared to other sequenced eudicots with a total non-redundant repeat content of  <dig> %. we further classified the repeats into two categories, the interspersed elements  comprising of retrotransposons  and dna transposons , and the tandem repeats  comprising of the low complexity repeats , simple repeats , and the satellite repeats  . the detected interspersed repeat sequences identified using different tools  were clustered using vmatch
 <cit> , giving rise to a consensus neem repeat element library of length  <dig> , <dig> bp .

we studied the insertion age distributions among the ltr-retrotransposons in a. indica made by the kimura 2-parameter distance matrix
 <cit>  and inferred that the oldest insertion event in neem dated back to  <dig>  million years . the frequency of insertion events peaks around  <dig> million years ago with smaller secondary peaks observed at ~ <dig> million and ~ <dig> million years ago respectively.

de novo transcriptome assembly
the scheme for transcriptome assembly and annotation is provided in figure
1b. the transcriptomes of different organs were independently assembled using inchworm . trinity performs better in comparison to other de novo transcriptome assembly programs for a wide range of parameters like genome complexity, read coverage and spliced isoforms
 <cit>  and hence was a natural choice for a. indica transcriptome assembly. chimeric transcripts observed during inchworm assembly
 <cit>  were filtered using pasa 
 <cit> . the pasa-filtered transcripts were then anchored to the genome scaffolds by assembling overlapped transcript alignments into maximal alignment assemblies in order to remove multiple spliced isoforms.

transcript annotation and gene prediction analysis
the transcriptome assemblies were annotated using the kegg automatic annotation server 
 <cit> . in addition to the kaas, the assemblies were serially annotated using; megablast
 <cit>  against the non-redundant nucleotide database, blastx against the non-redundant protein database, megablast against the refseqrna, expressed sequence tag , transcriptome shotgun assembly  databases
 <cit>  and autofact
 <cit>  using uniref <dig> and uniref100
 <cit> , kegg
 <cit> , cog
 <cit>  and nr
 <cit>  databases . in total,  <dig>  common and  <dig>  unique kegg annotations  across all organs  were observed. annotated/predicted genes in a. indica were compared with a non-redundant database containing green plants gene identifier  lists using homology-based searches. as shown in figure
 <dig>  a higher percentage of overlap was found between a. indica and v. vinifera, a plant known to express a host of terpernoids
 <cit> . as expected, genes common between a. indica and other species compared  had the highest number of kegg annotation associated with them . the transcripts from all organs were further assigned gene ontology  terms using blast2go
 <cit>  .

the a. indica rna-seq reads were aligned to the genomes or genome scaffolds of multiple plant species. the alignments of a. indica rna-seq reads to c. sinensis and c. clementina genome scaffolds by tophat
 <cit>  and cufflinks
 <cit>  suggest sequence similarity between neem and citrus . this is in agreement with the results obtained from our phylogenetic analysis . we built training sets using c. sinensis and c. clementina gene models and used glimmerhmm
 <cit>  to subsequently predict genes in a. indica. additionally, we used the a. thaliana training sets to represent a distantly related species for gene prediction analysis.

glimmerhmm
 <cit>  predicted greater number of gene models in a. indica using c. sinensis  and c. clementina  training sets compared to a.thaliana . the predicted genes were then serially annotated using megablast
 <cit>  and tblastx
 <cit>   resulting in  <dig>  and  <dig>  annotations with c. sinensis and c. clementina respectively. statistics for pasa
 <cit>  predicted mapped transcripts, gene structures and assembly is provided in table s <dig> in additional file
 <dig>  the overlap between the glimmerhmm and pasa predicted gene models was marginally higher using the c. clementina training set compared to the c. sinensis training set . the genes predicted by glimmerhmm using c. sinensis training set and training set candidates predicted by pasa identified  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes expressed in the root, leaf, stem and flower, respectively .

nucleotide composition, transcript expression and gene structure analysis
the nucleotide composition analyses in the transcriptome from all organs suggested different adenine , thymine , and guanine  cytosine  content distribution. the a + t content of most transcripts ranged between 20-40% while for g + c there were two distinct populations of transcripts, one with 0-20% and the other with 20-40% .

fragments per transcript kilobase per million fragment  values derived from trinity transcriptome assembly pipeline were used for expression analysis in different organs of neem . the fpkm values for transcripts with overlapping peaks at the same level of expression in all organs were plotted . the frequency histograms plotted after binning the transcripts suggested maximum density around ~40% gc with  <dig> - <dig>  log <dig>  values . in order to avoid erroneous expression analysis resulting from genes with multiple isoforms, the pasa-assembly pipeline were used to remove them and infer relative abundance of transcripts in different organs .

post-annotation, gc content comparisons were made between the genome versus transcriptome, introns versus exons and first introns versus first exons . the raw genomic reads were relatively gc-poor and the exons were relatively gc-rich . the genes those were inferred to accumulate to higher abundances in neem harbored longer introns when compared to the ones in a. thaliana, o. sativa and v. vinifera . although, there was variation in the exon size, similar correlation between the cumulative exon length and expression was observed.

comparative analysis of transcript expression
in neem, transcript abundances  were compared with their orthologs from other species after inter-species normalization of the expression values with elongation factor 1-alpha . among the  <dig> genes that were differentially abundant in neem, transcripts from three genes  were expressed at a higher level in a. indica compared to the other three species studied . ggps  is involved in terpenoid backbone synthesis, malz  in galactose metabolism and polygalacturonase  in starch and sucrose metabolism. unlike ggps, no other consensus gene was over-expressed to the same magnitude  in neem when compared to the other three species studied. a complete list of the genes and their relative tas in species is provided in table s <dig> in additional file
 <dig> 

terpenoid biosynthesis pathways
the genes related to quinone, terpenoid and terpenoid-backbone synthesis pathways were identified by kegg’s kaas automatic pathway annotation pipeline
 <cit> . ggps , coq <dig>  and cla <dig>  were among the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes in neem leaf compared to the other organs . eight genes  involved in the synthesis of sesquiterpenes and triterpenes leading to azadirachtin-a were over-expressed in neem compared to a. thaliana, o. sativa, c. sinensis and v. vinifera, . the length of introns in the terpenoid and steroid biosynthesis gene families in a. indica were greater compared to the ones in a. thaliana, o. sativa, c. sinensis and v. vinifera .

discussion
the current study describes the draft genome and transcriptomes from root, stem, leaf and flower. both neem and citrus belong to the order rutales and our phylogenetic studies reaffirmed their taxonomic closeness. additionally, phylogenetic studies grouped a. indica with the melia species, one that is also known to harbour bioactive compounds  suggesting a common evolutionary process with regard to synthesis of these compounds in meliaceae. repeat analysis showed low repeat content in a. indica genome compared with other sequenced angiosperms. this could have been due to the presence of xenobiotic terpenoids specific to the plant, which might have been a major impediment for horizontal gene transfer
 <cit> . this impediment in horizontal gene transfer could have skewed the conventional host-pathogen interactions countering the accumulation of repeats in a. indica compared to other contemporary angiosperms. insertion times of ltr elements in neem suggest a major wave of retro-transposition about 1million years ago , similar to the observation made in s. bicolor <cit> . however, in a. indica the oldest insertion event date back much further than s. bicolor . monocot genomes have higher gc content than dicots, which is reflected in an average difference in codon usage between them
 <cit> . interestingly, like o. sativa  <cit>  but unlike a. thaliana and others
 <cit> , the a. indica genome shows a bimodal distribution of gc content . domesticated crop genomes with higher gc content are likely to have evolved by a relaxation of a natural selection process against higher nitrogen use in dna due to the use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers
 <cit> . a. indica, a hardy plant, is not domesticated and can grow in poor and degraded soil including in semi-arid conditions with tolerance for high temperature
 <cit> . additionally, there is no history of any usage of nitrogen rich fertilizers to grow a. indica. this might have played a role in shaping the at-rich nucleotide composition of a. indica genome.

transcript abundances of genes in a. indica correlated well with their functions in respective organs; for example, root, leaf, stem and flower showed the presence of highly expressed ones involved in ion homeostasis, photosynthesis, ion transport and atpase activity, respectively. unlike the genome, a. indica transcriptomes exhibited unimodal gc distribution roughly overlapping with the higher gc peak of the genome . the distribution of a + t in a. indica transcriptomes mapped closer to the a. thaliana transcriptome than to the ones in o. sativa or v. vinifera . the lengths and the gc content of the first exons and first introns are reported to be associated with functional elements in other large genomes
 <cit> . the gc content of the first exons and first introns in a. indica were similar to that of other exons and introns in the genome . highly expressed primary transcripts of a. indica bear longer intron structures suggesting their possible functional role in expression and conforming with the results shown in other plants
 <cit>  and yeast
 <cit> .

sequencing and analysis of the genome and transcriptomes of neem holds significance due to the plant’s utility in agriculture and medicine. the use of botanical products as pest control and deterrence has acquired greater significance with the shifting trends in mainstream agriculture towards sustainable and organic farming. neem provides a suitable option for developing such eco-friendly and sustainable pesticides
 <cit> . currently a very small percentage of farmers use neem-based products as a substitute to synthetic pesticides as the general awareness of such practices remains limited. azadirachtin, derived from neem seed kernels, has been proved to be a potent and effective pesticide. total chemical synthesis of azadirachtin is challenging owing to the low yield of synthesis and remains a bottleneck for commercial bulk manufacturing. secondary metabolites synthesized by terpene synthases are the major components of essential oils and are of great economic value. in plants, synthesis of terpenes is compartmentalized into monoterpenes and diterpenes  that are produced via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate  pathway in the plastids while the sesquiterpenes and triterpenes are made in the cytosol via the mevalonate pathway
 <cit> . the enzymes involved in the synthesis of azadirachtin have not been studied in detail. the pathway hierarchy in neem-derived tetranortriterpenoid azadirachtin-a primarily requires the synthesis of a terpenoid backbone followed by steroid and triterpenoid biosynthesis. we found that the genes in the terpenoids and steroid biosynthesis family  were more abundant in neem compared to a. thaliana, o. sativa, c. sinensis and v. vinifera.

this study may help close the gap between traditional knowledge and current practices in the agrochemical industry. the progressive increase in the cost of petroleum-based starting materials has led to a surge in the price of synthetic pesticides scourging the meager profit margins presented to the farmers in developing countries. this study may provide a cost-effective alternative by aiding biotechnological research efforts in enhancing disease resistance in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
the de novo sequencing and analyses of the draft genome and organ-specific transcriptomes of neem plant, azadirachta indica is reported. a. indica is the first meliaceae family member to be sequenced. the neem genome bears fewer repetitive elements compared to other sequenced higher plants. it has about  <dig>  genes with an average transcript length of  <dig>  kbp. a. indica’s evolutionary closeness to citrus species was verified by both molecular phylogenetic analyses and sequence similarity. transcript expression and the exon-intron junction architecture of underlying genes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathways suggested relative abundance of enzymes involved in the azadirachtin synthesis in neem. genes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathways in neem bear longer introns compared to the same genes in a. thaliana, o. sativa, v. vinifera and c. sinensis.
