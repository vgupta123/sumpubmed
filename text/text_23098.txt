BACKGROUND
although rice  is a non-halophyte, the indica varieties pokkali and nonabokra are classified as salt tolerant based on various physiological parameters  <cit>  in comparison to the high yielding rice cultivars, which are salt sensitive. changes in gene expression are the underlying fact behind all the biochemical changes  <cit>  that occur in response to salinity stress. extensive effort to monitor and clone salinity stress induced genes, subtractive hybridization followed by est, resulted in cloning and identification of  <dig> cdnas from pokkali rice plants  <cit> . several such abiotic stress inducible genes, also inducible in vegetative tissues by exogenous application of the plant hormone abscisic acid  have been cloned and characterized from different plant species; e.g. em from wheat  <cit> , osem, rab16a-d, salt from rice  <cit> , lea, dehydrin from cotton and barley  <cit> , rab <dig> from maize  <cit> , etc. salinity or low water status enhances aba level in many plants including rice  <cit> . on the other hand, several abiotic stress inducible genes are not responsive to exogenous aba treatment, suggesting the existence of both aba-dependent and aba-independent pathways  <cit> .

since most promoters of aba-inducible genes contain acgtggc motifs within  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start sites, the motif was predicted to be an aba response element or abre. several functional t/cacgtggc-based abres with a core acgt  have been identified, two of such homologous motifs e.g. em1a from em gene of wheat and motif i from rab16a gene of rice were considered as strong abres  <cit> . in addition to abre, other gc-rich elements called as coupling element  were also detected from barley gene hva <dig> and considered as important in making the gene responsive to aba  <cit> . multiple copies of abres or related cis-elements generally occur in the upstream of aba/abiotic stress inducible genes. the presence of abre and/or abre-ce together as aba-responsive complex or abrc are essential for abiotic stress inducibility through aba-dependent pathway, and the trans-acting factor that strongly bind to abre, play necessary role in the expression of those genes  <cit> .

using the abre-dna as probe and screening the expression cdna library, the cdna of several basic leucine zipper  factors that bind abres have been cloned as candidates for aba-responsive transcription factors. embp <dig>  expressing in the mature wheat embryo and binding to em1a motif, was cloned by screening expression cdna library using -labeled em1a as probe. from the analysis of its primary structure, embp <dig> protein was found to be a bzip class of dna binding protein  <cit> . similarly, binding of nuclear factors to motif i, iia, iib present in the upstream of rab16a gene was also reported, but the binding factors were not cloned  <cit> . rita- <dig> mainly expresses in developing seeds of rice  <cit> . oszip-1a and oszip-2a in vegetative parts  <cit> , osbz <dig> expresses normally in developing rice embryo and inducible by dehydration or salinity stress in vegetative tissues  <cit> , trab <dig> expresses in developing seeds but also at low level in vegetative tissues of young rice plants  <cit> .

although the basic amino acid rich dna-binding domain of all these factors is highly conserved, binding to abre was demonstrated only with osbz <dig> and trab <dig>  trab <dig> was found to mediate aba-regulated transcription after interacting with the seed specific factor viviparous- <dig> . so, trab <dig> has been considered as the key player in aba inducible gene expression in developing seeds where vp <dig> is also expressed. the bzip factor oszip-1a binds to abre but its abundance was significantly reduced in presence of exogenous aba. the expression of the factor osbz <dig> in vegetative tissue of nipponbare rice plants has been studied in detail  <cit> . it was reported that its transcript accumulation in response to nacl or aba treatment preceded induction of other aba-responsive genes like rab16a and osem and their expression was cycloheximide insensitive. however, the bzip factor that plays the most important role in aba as well as nacl-stress induced gene expression in vegetative parts of rice still remains unknown.

in order to understand aba-regulated gene expression during nacl stress, we have done a comparative emsa study among different indica type rice varying in salt tolerance. based on the activity and expression patterns of osbz <dig>  we have proposed that the expression pattern of osbz <dig> directly correlates with the ability of the cultivar to tolerate salt stress. so, it was hypothesized that osbz <dig> can be considered as a key factor interacting with abre-based promoter and thereby regulating the aba or abiotic stress inducible genes in vegetative tissues. we have demonstrated that the specific dna-protein complex was enhanced in response to salinity stress and also by the addition of spermidine or gtp in the control nuclear extract  <cit> . although the factor involved in the complex formation were not identified, osbz <dig> was considered as the probable candidate. the presence of osbz <dig> in the dna-protein complex was proved by the identification of the band by antiserum against osbz <dig> 

RESULTS
northern blot analysis with gc <dig>  osbz8p and rab16a full length probe
ten-day-old pokkali plants were treated with nacl or aba or nacl along with cycloheximide and total rna was extracted from the roots and lamina. northern analysis of  <dig> μg of total rna with gc <dig>  identified transcripts of two different sizes  and their accumulation was cycloheximide insensitive . the size of the upper transcript matches well with the reported size of trab <dig>  <cit>  and that of the lower one  matches well with the reported size of osbz <dig>  <cit> . since both trab <dig> and osbz <dig> are bzip class of factors, presence of well-conserved sequence encoding basic dna-binding domain in the gc <dig> probe was the cause of hybridization with two different transcripts.

the full-length cdna for osbz <dig> was amplified from the poly a+ rna of  <dig> mm nacl-treated pokkali roots by rt-pcr using primers  designed from the two extreme ends of the orf of osbz <dig> cdna  made according to the published sequence  <cit> . sequence analysis revealed that orfs of osbz <dig> from both japonica var. nipponbare and indica var. pokkali and nonabokra were  <dig> bp long. they matched quite well except at five positions and all the amino acid changes are outside the dna-binding domain of the factor. the basic amino acid rich dna-binding domain of the bzip factors is highly conserved  <cit> . the n-terminal end of osbz <dig> was found to be unique as little homology was detected with other known bzip factors from rice at both nucleotide and amino acid level. therefore, the 5'end of the cdna encoding the n-terminal part of osbz <dig> was further amplified by ozbz <dig> and osbz83a primers. northern analysis with equal amount of total rna from salt sensitive m-i- <dig> and salt tolerant nonabokra rice plants with osbz8p , hybridization with the lower transcript  only was visible . as the probe is partial without the region coding for dna-binding basic amino acid rich domain, the larger transcript  did not hybridize. densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms revealed that the level of  <dig> -kb transcript of osbz <dig> in the nacl-treated roots of nonabokra was  <dig>  times than that in m-i- <dig>  whereas in lamina it was  <dig> times in nonabokra. the expression is higher in the roots of both the cultivars than in the laminar tissue. the salinity stress induced accumulation of the transcript was more pronounced in m-i- <dig> than in nonabokra, suggesting a regulation of expression of osbz <dig> gene at transcription level. transcripts of osbz <dig> may be present in so little amount in control roots and shoots of m-i- <dig> that it is almost undetectable by northern analysis.

comparable results were obtained in the expression pattern of rab16a-one of the important target genes for osbz <dig>  here also, the transcript for rab16a was detected only from nonabokra rice plants and very little or none from the salt sensitive m-i- <dig> . comparison among untreated and salt treated  plants showed constitutive expression in nonabokra rice plants. thus, a positive correlation in the expression of rab16a gene with that of osbz <dig> in nonabokra was observed.

emsa with -labeled abre-dna and laminar nuclear extracts of salt sensitive and tolerant rice cultivars
the active form of trans-acting factor that interacts with abre cis-element was compared between well-known salt sensitive and salt tolerant rice cultivars by emsa. equal amount of nuclear extract  of control and salt-treated m-i- <dig>  ir- <dig>  ir- <dig> ; ir- <dig>  and pokkali and nonabokra  was mixed with equal amount of -abre-dna probe  and emsa was performed . mobility shift of the probe was detected due to the formation of one distinct complex. the binding of the nuclear factor to the probe was found to be specific as the complex disappeared due to the competition with  <dig> fold molar excess of non-radioactive 1x abre or 4x abre or 2x abrc but not with 4x dehydration responsive element  or 2x ethylene responsive element  oligo-duplexes . since abrc contained abre and coupling element  <cit> , 2x abrc oligo-duplex showed competition with the probe. as dre or ere cis-acting-elements are not homologous to abre, competition did not occur. so, the shifted dna-protein complex in emsa was found to be highly specific and therefore use of 1x abre as probe in emsa, was considered as a faithful way to compare the level of active form  of trans-acting factor in nuclear extracts.

emsa was repeated to compare the level of abre-binding-factor present in the nuclear extracts of laminar tissue from control and salt-treated plants of different rice cultivars. emsa done with equal amount of nuclear extracts  and -labeled 1x abre-dna, clearly shows that the level of abre-binding-factor was very low and inducible by salinity stress in salt sensitive cultivars ; whereas, very high and constitutive in salt tolerant cultivars . in ir- <dig>  a moderately tolerant variety, expression of the factor is also in-between . nonabokra has higher level of the factor than pokkali . comparison of the protein profile of the nuclear extracts run on 12% sds-page used in the emsa experiments, as visible by staining with coomassie blue, showed no qualitative or quantitative differences within cultivars . the experiment was repeated four times, autoradiograms from four independent experiments were scanned and statistical analysis was done. the competition experiment  and the comparative emsa experiment  were found to be reproducible, as all of them showed similar difference within salt sensitive and salt tolerant indica rice cultivars.

emsa with the antiserum against the n-terminal end of osbz8
the  <dig> bp n-terminal unique region of osbz <dig> was cloned in pgex 3x to produce a  <dig> kd gst: osbz8p  fusion protein. perfect matching of the reading frames of gst with that of osbz8partial was verified by sequencing using gst primer. antiserum developed in rabbit, was further enriched and used at  <dig> to  <dig> dilution in a primary immunoblot analysis to determine the titre.

to investigate the presence of osbz <dig> in the abre-dna: nuclear protein complex in emsa, the diluted antiserum was added in the emsa reaction mixture. since, a conformational change in tertiary or quaternary structure of dna-binding polypeptide may be expected during its interaction with other protein or nucleic acid, the antibody-recognizing domain of osbz <dig> factor may or may not be accessible to the antibody when osbz <dig> is in the native form or bound to dna   <cit> . a preliminary experiment was done, by adding the antiserum to the rice nuclear extract either before or after incubation with abre-dna. supershift was visible only when the antiserum was added after the incubation of abre-dna probe with the laminar nuclear extracts of both ir- <dig> and pokkali , suggesting the presence of osbz <dig> factor in the abre-dna: nuclear protein complex.

to identify the polypeptide that binds to abre-dna probe in emsa, the shifted and the supershifted band from the dried gel were cut and polypeptide was eluted. the eluted fractions were analyzed by sds-page followed by silver staining  and immunoblot analysis. silver staining confirmed the presence of a 38-kd polypeptide  as the only major band, which was recognized by the antiserum  but not by the preimmune serum . the result indicates that the 38-kd polypeptide that makes complex with the abre-dna is osbz <dig> and its level is higher in salt tolerant rice cultivars than in the salt sensitive rice cultivars.

addition of spermidine or proline or gtp to the control nuclear extract from pokkali enhanced the intensity of the complex  <cit> . so, effect of addition of s <dig> fraction or atp or some kinase inhibitors to the nuclear extract was checked. nonabokra nuclear extracts was pre-incubated with nonabokra root soluble extract, a preparation we call s <dig> and emsa was performed. enhancement of complex formation was observed with the nonabokra control nuclear extract when pre-incubated with s <dig> prepared from salt-treated  nonabokra plants . no shift was obtained with s <dig> fraction only . addition of atp alone was found to slightly enhance complex formation, whereas pre-incubation of nuclear extract with heparin, a potent inhibitor of casein kinase ii, was found to be inhibitory. addition of r <dig>  or an indirect inhibitor of map kinase  did not show any inhibition .

similar emsa experiment was repeated with m-i- <dig> control nuclear extracts and the same result was obtained , suggesting similar mechanism of action in both sensitive and tolerant cultivars, only difference between them being the level of abre-binding-factor.

emsa with upstream of rab16a and rice nuclear extracts
when emsa of rice nuclear extracts were repeated with -rab16a upstream dna  as probe containing motif i, motif iia and motif iib, formation of two distinct complexes ci and cii was detected . the expression level of the binding factors was very high in nonabokra and salinity stress has little or no effect. intensity of both the complexes was undetectable in the untreated samples of salt sensitive m-1- <dig> and can be detected only in response to salinity stress, supporting the observations obtained from the emsa using abre-dna as probe. binding was specific as competition was observed with non-radioactive homologous dna, but complex cii was visible even with  <dig> fold excess of non radioactive abre-dna . addition of antiserum against osbz8p to the emsa reaction mixture of nonabokra nuclear extract caused the disappearance of the ci complex and had no effect on cii complex formation, suggesting the involvement of osbz <dig> in ci complex formation. formation of both complexes was undisturbed when pre-immune serum was added . binding of e.coli expressed full length osbz <dig> to the rab16a probe, probably to motif i site, was observed and the rosbz8fl: rab16a complex migrated to the same position as that of ci complex .

discussion
comparative emsa experiment between different cultivars showed distinct quantitative difference in the level of abre-binding-factor in lamina of salt sensitive and salt tolerant rice cultivars. it is believed that high level of aba contributes to the mechanism of salt tolerance through physiological changes and by regulation of many genes. it was demonstrated that at about  <dig> hours of imposition of osmotic shock , peak aba concentration varies within cultivars. it is 30-fold and  <dig> -fold higher in roots and shoots of nonabokra and 6-fold and  <dig> -fold in roots and shoots of pokkali, in comparison to roots and shoots of salt sensitive tn- <dig>  <cit> . though pokkali is more commonly known as to be a more tolerant variety, the difference is not so prominent at seedling stage. results of emsa consistently showed that the level of abre-binding factor is highest in nonabokra and it has the highest capacity to accumulate endogenous aba. the role of other factors, probably involved in the aba-independent pathway  <cit> , cannot be ruled out in the mechanism of salt-tolerance in case of pokkali. although larger area was covered by the shifted complex in emsa by nuclear extracts from nonabokra and pokkali, autoradiogram prepared from shorter exposure did not show multiple complexes or any qualitative difference within shifted complex . similar observations were made from the emsa experiments done with rab16a upstream dna as probe. moreover, disappearance of ci complex due to the competition by 1x abre, but not of cii complex, clearly proves that the ci complex was due to the binding of the nuclear factor to motif i which is an abre. antiserum when added to the emsa showed disappearance of ci complex, also suggesting that the motif i is the target site of osbz <dig>  since experiments with higher amount of rab probe and nuclear extracts were not repeated, it is difficult to predict why supershift was not observed. in fact, full length bacterially expressed osbz <dig> also binds to the rab16a probe and formed a complex, mobility of which is similar to that of the ci complex, suggesting that ci complex is actually formed by osbz <dig> present in nuclear extracts. data shows that the level of abre-binding-factor is  <dig> fold and  <dig> fold in nonabokra and pokkali respectively than in the salt sensitive rice cultivars. salinity stress enhances the level of abre-binding factor by  <dig>  fold in nonabokra,  <dig>  fold in pokkali,  <dig>  fold in ir- <dig> and  <dig>  fold in m-i- <dig> 

the aba-induced enhancement of complex formation in the emsa using abre  was compared using nuclear extract prepared from rice suspension-cultured cells treated with or without aba  <cit> . binding of nuclear factors to rab16a upstream region, especially to motif i-abre and also to motif iia and iib  were also shown by emsa when nuclear extract was used from 9-day-old young rice plants  <cit> . in all these studies, the in vivo abre-binding factor was not identified. we considered osbz <dig> as the factor present in the nuclear extract that binds to abre probe in emsa, as the level of osbz <dig> transcript was shown to be aba inducible and precedes the expression of other abiotic stress inducible genes through aba-dependent pathway in vegetative tissues like lamina.

southern analysis of osbz <dig> has already indicated that there are no other genes closely related to osbz <dig>  but several genes are present in the rice genome distantly related to osbz <dig>  <cit> . the n-terminal 140-aa sequence of osbz <dig> was found to be unique for the indica variety since using the n-terminal 140-aa sequence of osbz <dig> to blast the swiss-prot database, no other factors were found to have significant homology from indica variety. only two other bzip factors from japonica rice have over 90% homology with this 140-aa sequence . but, they are reported only as putative g-box binding factors and nothing was reported conclusively for them to bind the em1a element. we have also cloned and sequenced rab16a gene from ir- <dig>  pokkali and nonabokra. alignment of all three sequences again showed no significant difference at the nucleotide level . so, the difference only appears as varietal difference within cultivars. such varietal difference among cultivars is not uncommon as it was also found previously for other rice genes . moreover, analysis of the protein eluted from the emsa complex yielded only one major band of 38-kd with a few minor bands  even after silver staining; indicating the presence of only one major protein in the abre-dna complex. thus, choice of this n-terminal portion of osbz <dig> can be justified both in raising antibody that recognizes osbz <dig> from the emsa complex and also in the northern blot analysis. osbz <dig> polypeptide requires post-translational modification to attain conformation that favors binding to abre. in fact, addition of the cytosolic fraction to the emsa reaction mixture enhances the intensity of the complex, suggesting the presence of either the dna-binding factor also in the s <dig> fraction or an activator that triggers osbz <dig> to bind to abre. emsa with s <dig> alone did not show any shifted complex, thus nullifying the first probability . pre-incubation with different kinase inhibitors indicated the involvement of a casein kinase ii-like kinase activity. aba-as well as salinity stress-inducible kinase activity was detected from 3-day-old rice seedlings, the level of which was found to be highest in nonabokra . so, s <dig> fraction prepared from nonabokra was used as the source of activator . the transcription factor activation may be through phosphorylation directly to abre-binding factor or indirectly to another factor.

cloning and sequencing of the factor trab <dig>  which interacts with the seed specific factor vp <dig> and abre was reported  <cit> . since we do not have antibody against trab <dig> or vp <dig>  we could not check the presence of trab <dig> or vp <dig> or their analogue in the emsa complex. therefore, the presence of trab <dig> factor in the emsa complex cannot be ruled out. the activation of trab <dig> by phosphorylation  <cit>  also suggests the mechanism of post-translational modification.

the results of northern blot consistently reported that nonabokra plants have 4– <dig> times higher level of osbz <dig> transcript in comparison to m-1- <dig>  these results strongly support our previous observation  <cit>  that, in addition to induction by salinity stress at transcriptional level, mechanism of post-translational activation of osbz <dig> exists. question, therefore, arises whether salinity stress inducible accumulation in salt sensitive rice cultivars and constitutive expression of osbz <dig> in salt tolerant rice cultivars indicates a positive role of osbz <dig> towards tolerance to salinity. the expression of rab16a-one of the most common target genes of osbz <dig>  correlates well with that of osbz <dig>  i.e., its expression is also high  and constitutive in salt tolerant nonabokra, and undetectable in case of m-i- <dig>  transport proteins like plasma membrane h+-atpases involved in ion homeostasis are also constitutively expressed in tolerant or halophytes whereas inducible in salt sensitive cultivars  <cit> .

the presence of high level of osbz <dig> in salt tolerant rice cultivars in comparison to salt sensitive rice cultivars may be required for regulation of genes in lamina in aba mediated pathway necessary to adjust against salinity or water stress. overexpression of osbz <dig> in salt sensitive rice cultivar or down regulation of osbz <dig> in salt tolerant rice cultivars will answer whether osbz <dig> has any role in tolerance to salinity or water stress.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the northern blot and emsa clearly shows that the level of expression of the bzip factor osbz <dig>  is in the following ratio: nonabokra: pokkali: m-i-48: ir- <dig> = 6: 4: 2:  <dig>  the expression pattern of the target gene rab also correlates well with the expression of osbz <dig>  thus, this study lays the foundation for overexpressing osbz <dig> in salt sensitive high yielding rice varieties, which would firmly establish the role of osbz <dig> in regulation of abiotic stress inducible gene expression in vegetative tissue of rice.
