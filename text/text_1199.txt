BACKGROUND
since the identification of clavata <dig>  in the dicot arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , homologues and/or orthologues of this gene, known as the clv3-embryo-surrounding region  gene family
 <cit> , have been identified in nearly every major plant phylogenetic clade from which large-scale genomic or est sequence data are available, including monocots  and a bryophyte moss . the functional roles for most cle genes are still unknown. however, the roles for all cle genes that have been established, including clv <dig>  are in the regulation of seed development
 <cit>  or the homeostasis of meristematic tissues reviewed in
 <cit> , including the shoot apical meristem  
 <cit> , root apical meristem  
 <cit> , vascular cambium )
 <cit> , and root nodule meristems in several legume species 
 <cit> . as such, cle peptides play critical roles in the establishment, regulation and maintenance of plant architecture from the earliest stages of development.

although putative cle genes have been identified in monocot species that appear to encode multiple cle peptides that are presumably post-translationally processed
 <cit> , most plant cle genes are readily identified by several common structural motifs . generally, the precursor protein coding sequence is approximately 240- <dig> nt  in length. within these sequences are found signal peptide motifs ranging in length from 45- <dig> nt , followed by highly degenerate non-conserved sequences  ranging from ~120- <dig> nt  followed by the cle motif
 <cit> , a  <dig> nt  segment that contains the mature cle peptide sequence, which is reported to be a 12- <dig> aa hydroxyprolinated, triarabinosylated peptide in arabidopsis <cit> . in most cases, the two amino-terminal amino acids of the  <dig> aa cle motif are not found in the mature peptides, despite their conservation across species. there is evidence that these amino acids  constitute a protease recognition site involved in the post-translational processing of the precursor protein into mature cle peptides
 <cit> . generally, the cle gene protein-coding sequences terminate with the c-terminal amino acid of the mature cle peptide. however, not all cle genes conform to this paradigm, and c-terminal non-conserved sequences  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt  have been observed in cle genes from various species . these sequences are apparently trimmed from the precursor protein by a carboxypeptidase activity
 <cit> .

in contrast to the cle family, the root growth factor/cle-like/golven  gene family has only recently been identified and described
 <cit> . like the cle genes, they encode short, secreted peptides that affect aspects of plant development. structurally, the rgf/clel/glv genes are similar to the cle genes in that they encode precursor proteins with a signal peptide, followed by an ncs <dig> region with a c-terminally oriented 12- <dig> aa peptide that is post-translationally processed to the active form . also like the cle genes, some clel genes encode proteins with c-terminal ncs <dig> regions of varying lengths . the clel peptides, as their name suggests, have very similar sequences to the cle peptides. a key difference between the cle and clel peptides is that the clel peptides are variable in length at 13- <dig> amino acids, as compared to the  <dig> amino acids of the cle peptides. perhaps the most salient distinguishing feature between cle and clel peptides is the aspartic acid-tyrosine pair at the n-termini of all but one the rgf/clel/glv active peptides. the sole exception to this rule is found in the glv <dig> peptide, which contains a functionally conserved glutamic acid residue at its n-terminus in place of aspartic acid
 <cit> . at least some of the clel peptides are post-translationally tyrosine sulphated, which is essential for aspects of their activity in vivo, including ram homeostasis
 <cit> . interestingly, the conserved amino-terminal asp-tyr pair of the clel peptides is a characteristic shared with the sulphotyrosine peptide ligands plant peptide containing sulfated tyrosine  <dig>  and phytosulfokine 
 <cit> . however, psk and psy <dig> are not otherwise similar to the clel peptides.

meng et al.
 <cit>  pointed out that the rgf/clel/glv peptides possess sequences that are similar to the cle peptides. in fact, this group noted that the cle <dig> gene also possessed a clel motif near its c-terminus in addition to its cle <dig> motif, which is located in the middle of the protein. they went on to demonstrate that this clel motif conferred long roots to arabidopsis plants when exogenously applied to roots in the form of a synthetic peptide. for this reason and the fact that not all of the so-called rgf genes had expression patterns restricted to roots, they named the gene family cle-like . we use this nomenclature throughout the remainder of this paper.

based on the combined analyses of matsuzaki et al.
 <cit> , meng et al.
 <cit>  and whitford et al.
 <cit> , there are at least twelve clel genes in the arabidopsis genome, including cle <dig>  which contains both cle and clel domains
 <cit> . whitford et al.
 <cit>  also identified  <dig> clel  genes in rice  and eleven clel genes in quaking aspen . as more recently identified genes/peptides, less is understood about the clel family in terms of their posttranslational processing and mode of action. matsuzaki et al.
 <cit>  demonstrated that a tyrosine-sulphated form of clel <dig>  restored ram maintenance of a tyrosine sulphotransferase mutant in conjunction with psk and psy <dig>  root waving has been reported to result from the application of the cle <dig> clel peptide
 <cit>  and agravitropism has been reported in clel  mutants
 <cit> .

although the vast majority of extant land plant species are angiosperms, the gymnosperms, primarily the conifers, constitute approximately one-third of earth’s forest biomes
 <cit> , covering approximately 15% of global land area, primarily in the boreal forest
 <cit> . a substantial fraction of the world’s wood and wood products are derived from conifer species. therefore, understanding the molecular basis for conifer growth and development, particularly wood formation, is critical for improvement of commercial forest productivity, necessary to meet increasing global demands for wood and wood products without increasing the rate of global deforestation
 <cit> .

despite the economic importance of conifers, relatively little is known about growth regulation in these species. for example, no peptide ligand has been described in any gymnosperm species to date. as the cle and clel peptide ligands are broadly conserved families of regulatory molecules of fundamental importance to the maintenance of meristematic tissues as well as other developmental processes, we sought to identify expressed gymnosperm homologues of these genes as a first step toward understanding the roles of peptide ligands and meristem regulation in this major phylogenetic clade.

RESULTS
identification of conifer cle and clel genes from public est and genome sequence data
tblastn searches for cle and clel genes in public gymnosperm est databases initially yielded  <dig> candidate cle gene ests only in eight different pinophyta species. contig analysis yielded  <dig> unique contigs. manual validation of the putative cle gene sequences resulted in the elimination of one contig from chamaecyparis obtusa, due to weak sequence conservation, a truncated open reading frame for the presumed cle gene and a clear open reading frame on the opposite strand. thus, a total of  <dig> pinophyta est sequences in  <dig> contigs from seven different species were identified as predicted cle genes .

we also conducted a tblastn search in the ncbi/embl/ddbj gymnosperm est databases for clel family members using the a. thaliana clel motif sequences. this search yielded nine ests, again only from conifer est databases, from five different species. six unique contigs were constructed from these ests. after manual validation and a second query with the identified conifer clel genes,  <dig> ests in five contigs were identified as predicted clel genes .

the cle peptide motif sequences from the  <dig> predicted cle genes identified in the est searches were used to query the recently published genome sequences of two spruce species, picea abies and p. glauca <cit>  for the genomic copies of the p. glauca est sequences, as well as to identify other members of the cle gene family not previously detected in est sequencing projects. this search resulted in the identification of  <dig> apparent cle genes  containing  <dig> different cle sequences among the eight conifer species . only three of the predicted cle genes had introns . subsequent queries of the spruce genomes with arabidopsis cle motifs did not identify any additional cle genes.

as with the cle genes, the five clel peptide motifs were used to query the p. abies and p. glauca genome sequences. unlike the cle genes, although many putative clel peptide domains were identified, we could not identify any clel sequences that were directly downstream of a putative signal peptide domain within a continuous open reading frame . thus, it seemed likely that there were no clel genes that lacked introns within the genomes of these two organisms. therefore, the full clel est contig sequences were used in tblastn searches of the p. abies and p. glauca genome sequences. the results of these searches revealed extensive regions of alignment in non-contiguous segments within several genomic scaffolds of both of these species. these alignments provided approximate guides to intron/exon splice junctions to enable the construction of gene models based on the genome sequence . from this analysis, the predicted genomic sequences and gene structures of the two full-length p. glauca est contigs clel <dig> and clel <dig> were readily identified , and these sequences were used to identify their presumed p. abies orthologues, clel <dig> and clel <dig>  respectively, due to the high degree of sequence conservation between these two species .

using the p. engelmannii × glauca clel <dig> partial protein sequence as a query yielded the p. glauca gene clel <dig> and its presumed p. abies orthologue, clel <dig> . both of these genes had only one intron . the identification of a putative clel sequence in a p. glauca genome sequence scaffold led us to search for a presumed 5′ exon containing a putative signal peptide, resulting in the identification of the predicted genes clel <dig> and clel <dig> . these are the only predicted clel genes we identified that are not validated by at least some est evidence for expression or structure. like clel <dig> and clel <dig>  these genes are predicted to have only one intron each and the predicted clel <dig> intron is the longest of any of the introns we identified in these genes.

predicted clel genes encode alternatively spliced transcripts with different clel peptide domains
interestingly, the tblastn search using the p. sitchensis clel <dig> partial protein sequence , although not full-length, revealed that this gene also aligned with the same genomic scaffold as clel <dig>  but the alignment included putative protein coding segments not found in clel <dig> mapping to a long segment in ncs <dig> that is not shared by clel <dig> and clel <dig> . this prompted us to investigate possible alternative splicing in this gene, using the clel <dig> alignment as a guide. this resulted in the identification of an excellent alternative splice donor sequence  in the middle of the terminal coding exon of clel <dig>  and from this we identified the alternative transcript encoding the putative p. glauca protein clel <dig> , which is 98% identical to the p. sitchensis partial predicted protein sequence  and encodes a clel peptide sequence from a different exon than that encoding the clel <dig> peptide . examination of the presumed clel <dig> orthologue clel <dig> in p. abies for a similar splice variant yielded two genes, clel <dig> and clel <dig>  which encode nearly identical protein sequences encoded by two different sets of exons due to apparent exon duplication within the locus , with the protein sequences differing only by a  <dig> aa indel toward their c-termini . this alternative splicing structure encoding nearly identical proteins was not found in clel <dig> in p. glauca.

the discovery of alternative splicing in the clel14/clel <dig> and clel18/clel23/clel <dig> genes led us to search for splice variants in clel <dig> and clel <dig> in p. glauca and p. abies respectively, as multiple clel domains were also identified in these scaffolds. these searches revealed the alternatively spliced clel <dig> and clel <dig> in the p. glauca and p. abies genomes, respectively . all the predicted alternatively spliced clel gene pairs  encode transcripts that have distinct clel peptide sequences.

meta-analysis of conifer cle and clel gene expression
meta-analysis of the public est sequence data showed that most of the cle genes were identified in bark , xylem  root  or mixed tissue  libraries . the genes that were not observed in bark, xylem or root libraries were mostly cloned from shoot/foliage  libraries , with the exception of cle <dig>  which was also identified in a male strobilus library in addition to bark . cle <dig> was the only conifer cle gene identified from a developing embryo library and this gene was also found in both untreated and paraquat-treated root tissues of germinated plants . there was almost no overlap in the cle genes identified between xylem and phloem tissues. the sole exception to this observation was cle <dig>  which was found in pinus contorta xylem and bark libraries from wounded trees .

in contrast to the cle genes, no clel gene was identified from xylem in our est sequence meta-analysis. clel genes were primarily identified in root  and shoot  libraries, with only clel <dig> identified in a bark library . among the clel genes, only clel <dig> and clel <dig> were identified in more than one library, although these were not from different tissue types .

contig analysis of the cle and clel ests showed very good agreement among individual reads, even among sequencing projects of different laboratory groups, which presumably used different genotypes. as expected, most of the sequence differences between contiguous transcripts were found in the predicted 5′- and 3′-utr regions of these contigs. only one indel that could not be attributed to a potential sequencing artefact was observed, a 20 bp insertion in the predicted 5′-utr of one cle <dig> transcript, which appears to be a direct repeat of the immediately following 20 bp segment . nucleotide sequence differences resulting in differences in amino acid sequence were found in cle <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . predicted silent mutations were also observed in cle <dig> and cle <dig> . among the clel ests, only clel <dig> showed differences, with seven amino acid differences between presumed alleles, as well as two apparent silent differences in sequence . there was an apparent frameshift between two clel <dig> sequences , but this appears likely due to an error in one of the sequences. the longer open reading frame was chosen to represent the clel <dig> protein , as this sequence was predicted to encode a signal peptide . this open reading frame was confirmed by the genomic sequences of putative orthologues of this gene from p. glauca and p. abies .

bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis of the conifer cle and clel gene contigs
predicted amino acid sequences of the cle and clel est consensus contigs were further analysed to determine the presence of putative signal peptides in their sequences. signalp  <dig> 
 <cit>  analysis of all cle and clel amino acid sequences shows that all the predicted full-length proteins possess predicted signal peptides, as expected of functional cle and clel proteins .

multiple alignment of the predicted conifer cle and clel amino acid sequences revealed that several cle genes apparently have multiple highly conserved copies in the genomic sequences, with several scaffolds harbouring identical, or nearly identical sequences . intriguingly, the genes encoding the identical cle <dig> and cle <dig> proteins are found on the same scaffold , suggesting that many of these duplicated cle and clel scaffolds could indeed be duplicate genes within these large genomes.

strong sequence conservation among presumed orthologous genes across species  was also observed. for example, among the predicted proteins cle <dig> , cle <dig>  and cle <dig>  , cle <dig> and cle <dig> show 100% sequence conservation between these two spruce species, and these are  <dig> % identical to the pinus protein sequence.

we examined the phylogenetic relationships to arabidopsis among the conifer cle and clel precursor protein sequences as a first attempt to assess potential protein role and/or function. a 1000-iteration neighbour-joining analysis grouped the conifer protein sequences with varying degrees of phylogenetic distance from the arabidopsis cle and clel clades . in particular, a large clade of  <dig> protein sequences was grouped with arabidopsis cle <dig> and cle <dig> proteins and  <dig> other conifer proteins were grouped with arabidopsis cle <dig> . among the clel proteins, the closest arabidopsis - pinophyta evolutionary relationship was seen with p. glauca clel <dig> and arabidopsis rgf <dig> . clel <dig> grouped with cle <dig>  but this relationship may be spurious, as clel <dig> is only a partial protein sequence.
 <cit> , with conifer sequences grouped with their closest arabidopsis homologue, as depicted in figure 
4a. closest matching arabidopsis-pinophyta homologues are indicated by boxes and light grey highlighting over the protein names. the perfectly matching predicted cle peptides between arabidopsis and the pinophyta are indicated by dark grey highlighting over the pinophyta sequences. mismatches in the pinophyta sequences from their closest arabidopsis homologue are indicated by black highlighting and inverse lettering. perfectly matching cle peptide sequences amongst the pinophyta species are indicated by highlighting of various colours.

to assess potential functionality of and/or roles in plant growth and development by the conifer cle proteins, we directly compared the cle peptide sequences to the  <dig> arabidopsis cle peptide sequences, sorted by the arabidopsis gene overexpression phenotypes as described by strabala et al.
 <cit> . we grouped the conifer peptide sequences with their most closely related protein as inferred from the neighbour-joining analysis in figure 
4a. this comparison shows that the conifer cle peptides are in general quite closely related to their predicted arabidopsis counterparts. moreover, there are many examples of perfect sequence conservation of cle peptide sequences amongst the conifer species, even across genera  such that the conifer cle gene contigs can be further grouped to  <dig> unique predicted cle peptide sequences . interestingly, with one exception, none of the known conifer cle peptides is perfectly conserved with an arabidopsis peptide . the sole exception is the finding that ests encoding perfectly conserved cle41/44-tdif peptide sequences were found in every conifer species examined .

synthetic cle peptides exert developmental effects on pine seedlings
to begin to assess whether the close sequence conservation of the predicted cle peptides between arabidopsis and the pinophyta conferred similar phenotypic effects on pine seedlings to those observed in arabidopsis, we applied two synthetic cle peptides, cle <dig> and cle41/44-tdif to in vitro-germinated pinus radiata zygotic embryos. these two peptides were chosen since they were either identical , or differing by only one amino acid  from predicted conifer cle peptides . additionally, these peptides belong to important cle subfamilies that exert opposite effects on root growth, yet have been demonstrated to exert synergistic effects on the development of vascular tissue in arabidopsis <cit> . as in arabidopsis seedlings, the cle <dig> peptide inhibited root elongation at concentrations as low as 10 μm . cle41/44-tdif also inhibited root elongation in germinated pine zygotic embryos, and its effect was indistinguishable from cle <dig> at 100 μm concentration . combining the cle <dig> and cle <dig> peptides resulted in essentially the same effect as application of cle <dig> alone, although some root elongation was observed in the 100 μm dual application . no reproducible effect on vascular tissue either in the root or the shoot was observed in these plants .

molecular cloning and sequence analysis of pinus radiata orthologues of cle <dig> and cle189
we utilised the high degree of sequence conservation amongst pine species to design pcr primers based on the p. taeda cle41/44-tdif gene  sequences for amplification and molecular cloning of presumed orthologous coding sequences from pinus radiata genomic dna. as expected, these primers readily amplified the putative cle <dig> and cle <dig> orthologues from pinus radiata , which were 100% and  <dig> % identical to the p. taeda sequences at the nucleotide level, respectively , and 100%  and  <dig> % identical  at the amino acid sequence level . this analysis revealed that, as expected, cle <dig> and cle <dig> contain no introns, at least not in their protein-coding segments .

expression of the native cle209/ <dig> genes in planta and in cultured cells
due to the perfect sequence conservation between the cle41/ <dig> and cle209/ <dig> peptides, we sought to verify experimentally whether the phloem-specific expression localisation of the cle41/ <dig> genes
 <cit>  was also conserved in p. radiata. to test this hypothesis, we isolated total rna from developing xylem, developing phloem and whole roots and performed qpcr experiments with primers specific for cle <dig> and cle <dig>  as expected, expression of cle209/ <dig> in stems was specific to developing phloem, with very low, if any, expression in xylem cells . similar to the relative expression of cle <dig> to cle <dig> in arabidopsis inflorescence stems
 <cit> , expression of cle <dig> was approximately twice that of cle <dig> in both phloem and root . in the pine tracheary element  system
 <cit> , cle <dig> was at its highest abundance  in the early part  of the differentiation process, and its expression levels gradually declined to about 8-fold over basal expression levels as the number of differentiated tes increased . in contrast, cle <dig> was only induced about 5-fold over a much lower basal expression level relative to cle <dig> such that cle <dig> mrna was ~37-fold more abundant than cle <dig> at day  <dig> but only ~6-fold more abundant at day  <dig>  in contrast to cle <dig>  the expression level of cle <dig> peaked only at day  <dig> and apparently remained steady thereafter .

discussion
the cle genes and peptides in plants are ancient and with a cle gene found in the genome of the bryophyte moss physcomitrella patens, the cle genes are distributed throughout the plant kingdom and date back more than  <dig> million years in plant evolutionary history
 <cit> . this sequence conservation is likely consistent with the multiple fundamental roles that cle peptides play in plant development. despite such sequence conservation, cle genes had not been described to date in any conifer species. this is also the case for the clel genes, although this appears to be a much smaller gene family and these genes were much more recently identified and described
 <cit> . our meta-analysis of publicly available gymnosperm est and genome sequence data revealed many cle and clel genes in a variety of conifer species. with the exception of the presumed cle41/44-tdif orthologues, no predicted conifer cle or clel peptide exhibited complete sequence conservation with any arabidopsis cle peptide . however, many predicted conifer cle peptides are closely conserved with arabidopsis cle peptides  and this may suggest potential roles in conifer tree development.

unlike most other species, analysis of the p. glauca and p. abies genome sequences revealed a large number of apparent paralogous genes, presumably arising from gene duplication events, encoding essentially perfectly conserved cle proteins. given the draft status of these genome sequences, it is unclear whether these genes are true paralogues, or simply genome assembly artefacts. however, one p. abies scaffold encoding the identical proteins cle <dig> and cle <dig>  suggests that at least some of these identical or nearly identical genes may in fact also be paralogous. closure of scaffold gaps will be required to verify these genes.

when intraspecies and interspecies conservation of predicted cle peptides is taken into account,  <dig> unique cle dodecamer sequences are observed . these  <dig> unique sequences are comparable with the  <dig> cle genes and  <dig> unique cle dodecamer peptide sequences found in arabidopsis. it is interesting to note that despite the high degree of sequence similarity found between the p. abies and p. glauca genomes, there is currently not complete overlap among their cle gene sequences. cle gene structure in spruce appears to parallel that of arabidopsis, with all but two genes  lacking introns. due to the draft status of the two spruce genomes, it is currently unclear whether these are the only cle genes with introns. as with the clel genes, other strong matches to the cle domains were identified in the p. glauca and p. abies genomes, but the sequences were generally near to the ends of scaffolds, so gene structure predictions could not be made. future builds of these draft genomes with additional sequence data will likely result in the identification of additional cle and clel genes and reveal potential orthologous genes that cannot currently be unambiguously identified.

as in arabidopsis, it appears that the clel gene family comprises fewer genes than the cle gene family. like most arabidopsis clel genes, all the predicted pinophyta clel genes contain introns . although alternative splicing of arabidopsis clel genes has been observed, these splice events do not affect the sequence of the active peptides encoded by these genes . unlike the known clel genes, it appears that at least some of the clel genes in the pinophyta are alternatively spliced to transcripts that encode proteins with different putative clel peptide active sequences from exons separated from each other by ~ <dig> kilobase pair . while alternative splicing events leading to slightly different isoforms of peptide ligands such as ghrelin
 <cit>  or systemin
 <cit>  have been reported, to our knowledge, this splicing of distinct, widely separated alternative exons is a unique phenomenon with regard to peptide ligands. this phenomenon in turn suggests the potential for novel mechanisms of the regulation of clel expression in the pinophyta that are not known to exist in other plant species. one such mechanism might be that the alternative clel transcripts are mutually exclusively produced in different tissue and/or cell types. another mechanism might be the dynamic alterations of the ratio of the alternative transcripts within a cell, tissue or organ to “fine tune” a physiological or developmental process. it is conceivable that both such mechanisms could be occurring simultaneously. regardless, these alternatively spliced clel forms suggest a previously unsuspected degree of dynamism in conifer signal transduction pathways.

despite the ancient date of divergence of angiosperms from gymnosperms, estimated at 270- <dig> million years ago
 <cit> , conifers and dicotyledonous angiosperms still share certain characteristics not shared between the more recently diverged dicotyledon and monocotyledon angiosperm lineages. a particularly salient characteristic is the shared capacity for secondary growth between conifers and dicotyledons, which is the basis for wood formation
 <cit> . monocot species lack this capacity and achieve thickening of the stem via other mechanisms
 <cit> . although significant inroads have been made in understanding the regulation of secondary growth at the molecular level in dicots , far less is understood about these processes in conifers. therefore, the discovery of genes encoding perfectly conserved cle41/44-tdif peptide orthologues in all the pinophyta species that are known to have cle genes is strongly suggestive of a conserved role between conifers and dicots for these peptides in the regulation of vascular cambium homeostasis. this hypothesis is all the more compelling considering that there is essentially no other sequence conservation between these arabidopsis and conifer gene sequences , suggesting very strong selective pressure for the conservation of the cle41/44-tdif peptide sequence among species with a vascular cambium. consistent with such a hypothesis, all the conifer cle41/44-tdif ests we identified in our est database meta-analysis were sourced from rna isolated from inner bark and/or phloem or root tissues . the bioinformatic meta-analysis was confirmed by our p. radiata qpcr results that showed phloem-specific expression in the stem, as well as expression in root . this expression pattern is also consistent with that of the presumed arabidopsis orthologues, cle <dig> and cle <dig> <cit> . therefore, it seems possible that the cle41/44-tdif genes in conifers are playing similar roles in the regulation of secondary growth to those in dicot species. this apparent conservation of a key component of the mechanism of vascular cambium homeostasis between dicot angiosperms and gymnosperms may be an indicator of the inherent capacity of these clades to make wood. indeed, the natural variation in lignin content, neutral monosaccharide content, microfibril angle and biomechanical properties in arabidopsis inflorescence stems showed correlations that were consistent with correlations in many of these traits in woody species
 <cit> . strikingly, the cle41/44-tdif peptide motif is only known to be conserved in only one monocot species, the date palm, phoenix dactylifera <cit> , which undergoes stem thickening, although via a different mechanism that is less well understood than that of woody plants.

it is well-established that cle41/44-tdif is an inhibitor of in vitro te differentiation
 <cit>  as well as xylem differentiation
 <cit> . therefore, the observation that the expression of the likely pine orthologues of the cle41/ <dig> genes are in fact apparently upregulated upon induction of pine te differentiation , seems initially counterintuitive. however, in arabidopsis plants the cle41/ <dig> genes are only expressed in differentiated phloem cells
 <cit> . thus, in the p. radiata te differentiation system
 <cit> , which presumably initially comprises dedifferentiated and/or undifferentiated cells, the expression of cle41/44-tdif would not be expected prior to initiation of differentiation . since it is now clear that differentiated phloem cells provide developmental cues to the vascular cambium in the form of cle41/44-tdif to suppress xylem differentiation
 <cit> , expression of cle41/44-tdif is thus a specific marker for phloem cells. therefore, the strong induction of the cle41/44-tdif orthologues cle209/ <dig> in the p. radiata te system  indicates that the te differentiation is accompanied by the differentiation and development of phloem or phloem-like cells and thus this in vitro system very closely parallels vascular development in planta. hirakawa et al.
 <cit>  demonstrated a role for cle41/44-tdif in stimulating the proliferation of procambial cells, the cell type in which the cle41/44-tdif receptor, pxy, is found
 <cit> . thus, only upon induction of differentiation of tracheary elements is the presence of the cle41/44-tdif peptide required, as some non-te cells must exist to provide signals to the cells that eventually differentiate into tes
 <cit>  and cle41/44-tdif is required to maintain this undifferentiated state. thus, the so-called tracheary element differentiation system may also be thought of as a phloem/procambium differentiation system as well.

cle gene overexpression and synthetic peptide application have been used extensively to characterise cle functions in planta. we wished to examine the effects of cle family members that have synergistic effects on vascular development in arabidopsis to determine if such relationships hold in conifers. we were unable to observe any effects on vascular development in freshly germinated p.radiata seedlings because, unlike arabidopsis, extended periods in liquid medium are not tolerated well by this species , leading to artefacts that obscured any effects on vascular development. however, we did find that both cle <dig> and cle41/44-tdif peptides inhibited root development when applied to pine seedlings with some solid support, to prevent the submergence of the seedlings. cle <dig>  a potent inhibitor of root elongation in both arabidopsis and rice
 <cit>  was more effective than cle41/44-tdif in this regard. interestingly, with application of both peptides, inhibition of root elongation appeared not to be as strong as cle <dig> alone, either at  <dig> or 100 μm, or cle <dig> alone at 100 μm , so there may be some synergistic interactions between these peptides in pine as well.

it was somewhat unexpected that cle <dig> peptide inhibited root development in pine at all, since experiments in arabidopsis have shown that has no effect on root elongation either when overexpressed
 <cit> , or when exogenously applied
 <cit> . however, kinoshita et al.
 <cit>  demonstrated that cle41/ <dig> had a mild inhibitory effect on root elongation in rice when applied to roots at a 1 μm concentration. presumably, this inhibition would have been greater at a 10 μm concentration , so it appears that this root response to exogenous cle41/ <dig> is shared between pine and rice. the basis for this shared response is not yet clear. cle41/ <dig> is not an endogenous peptide in rice as it is in conifers and dicots. despite the conservation of the cle41/ <dig> peptide in conifers, p. radiata is substantially evolutionarily diverged from a. thaliana. additionally, such experiments provide cle peptides at significantly higher concentrations than is found in vivo . this situation likely causes cle peptides to bind to receptors that they would not normally bind, resulting in neomorphic or antimorphic phenotypes
 <cit> . although it appears that cle41/44-tdif phloem-specific expression in arabidopsis is conserved
 <cit> , which implies a putative pxy receptor orthologue in pine, the ectopic responses of other receptors resulting from interaction with cle41/44-tdif may not be the same as arabidopsis in all cases.

CONCLUSIONS
the cle and clel peptide ligand families are well known to play many important roles in angiosperm plant growth and development. conifer and dicot angiosperm taxa share certain growth characteristics, most notably a vascular cambium, not shared by monocot angiosperms, yet they differ fundamentally in many other aspects of their growth and development. we show that cle and clel genes are found in the pinophyta with gene numbers and sequence diversity similar to angiosperms, yet their active peptide sequences are not perfectly conserved, with one exception, the conserved cle41/44-tdif peptide. our experiments involving this peptide and p. radiata orthologues of the genes encoding are suggestive that they play orthologous roles in vascular development among conifer and dicot species. conversely, we provide evidence that at least some clel genes appear to be regulated in completely different ways than their angiosperm counterparts, via splicing of alternative exons that encode different clel peptides. the substantial sequence differences between these alternate peptides suggest that they either bind different receptors, or if they interact with the same receptor, they do so with different affinities and/or binding sites. although alternative transcript splicing is a thoroughly studied phenomenon, to our knowledge, this is a completely novel means to regulate the expression of peptide signalling ligands. further comparative analysis of these signalling ligand gene families in conifers and dicot angiosperms will surely lead to deeper understanding of growth and developmental processes in both of these major phylogenetic clades and our ability to manipulate these processes for more sustainable wood and wood product production.
