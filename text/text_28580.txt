BACKGROUND
antimicrobial peptides have a critical role in the vertebrate innate immune defence against microbes. these peptides have potential as therapeutics and intelligent drug design relies on understanding how these molecules function. defensins are peptides, which are generally cationic, are produced as prepropeptides and can be divided into subclasses based on the distribution of the six canonical cysteines that are located in the mature peptide. there are only two subclasses shared between mouse and human, the α and β-defensins. these molecules both have six canonical cysteine residues but differ in the spacing of these residues and the intramolecular disulphide bridges formed  <cit> . the antimicrobial activity of both α and β-defensins in vivo is well established  <cit> . more recently β-defensins have been shown to act as a link between adaptive and innate immunity  <cit>  and play important roles in cancer progression  <cit> . this has stimulated great interest in the function and evolution of β-defensins in primate lineages  <cit> .

genes that are involved in host defence often display high rates of genomic divergence and evidence for adaptive evolution. as seems to be the case with other proteins involved in the immune response, such as mhc molecules, immunoglobulins and α-defensins, this selection may be a response to the rapid evolution of pathogens  <cit> . in agreement with this, the four well-studied human β-defensins vary in their expression patterns as well as their antimicrobial and antiviral activities  <cit> . we have previously investigated the  <dig> functional human genes at the major 8p22-p <dig> β-defensin locus and  <dig> genes at the orthologous mouse locus. in both mouse and human, β-defensin paralogues show little sequence similarity in the mature peptide region and this divergence appears to have been driven by positive selection following duplication  <cit> . these genes show an unusual pattern of evolution, with rapid divergence between second exon sequences that encode the mature peptides matched by relative stasis in the first exons that encode signal peptides  <cit> . however, these previous studies detected positive selection acting during the more distant evolutionary history of this locus to produce a diverse cluster of paralogous genes apparently established early in mammalian evolution  <cit> . the evidence for positive selection acting within primate lineages since this paralogous cluster was established has been more equivocal and fragmentary. it has been reported that both defb <dig>  <cit>  and defb <dig>   <cit>  have evolved neutrally in primate lineages with no evidence for positive selection. in contrast there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that the evolution of primate defb <dig>  genes has involved positive selection  <cit> . the selective forces operating on the other β-defensins at this locus in primate lineages have, until now, remained unknown.

many of the previous analyses of β-defensin genes depended upon statistical tests based on a traditional pairwise approach, calculating and comparing the rate of non-synonymous  and synonymous  substitution between two sequences averaged over all codons. however this approach is not appropriate for short sequences  since they do not provide sample sizes  that are large enough to give significant results. in addition, because such methods are based upon the dn/ds ratio across the whole length of the sequences under consideration, purifying selection at some sites could obscure the action of positive selection at other sites. a popular alternative strategy is to use likelihood ratio tests  that allow one to estimate the dn/ds ratio  at particular sites rather than averaging it over the whole molecule. this site-specific analysis has been successful at detecting positive selection in a variety of genes, particularly in gene families following expansion by duplication, and computer simulations have confirmed the power of the analysis  <cit> . however, suzuki and nei  <cit>  found that positively selected amino acid sites are more reliably inferred by parsimony-based methods than by likelihood-based methods, with the latter prone to producing false positives. recently a new sliding window approach based on maximum parsimony has been devised to conservatively predict the presence of selection from alignments, with special attention paid to reducing false positives  <cit> . also suzuki  <cit>  has developed software that can detect positively and negatively selected sites based upon maximum parsimony, bayesian or maximum likelihood methods. given the known shortcomings of the methods available it seems most prudent to restrict attention to sites that are inferred to be subject to selection by multiple methods  <cit> . we have used a combined strategy, complementing likelihood and parsimony-based approaches to give a comprehensive account of the selection acting at the main β-defensin locus in human, and the orthologous loci in a range of other primates and mouse. we provide statistically significant evidence for the action of both positive and negative selection in both rodent and primate lineages, and reveal the putatively functional sites within the peptide structures that have been subject to these forces at different times.

RESULTS
a neighbor-joining  tree was constructed from the  <dig> aligned mouse and primate amino acid sequences using p-distance estimates . this tree and an alignment of nucleotide sequences derived from the protein alignment  were used in the analyses that follow. it should be noted that all  <dig> mouse genes analysed here are readily detectable on the orthologous rat chromosome  <dig> and that apparently mouse specific clades in figure  <dig> are therefore likely to be rodent specific. orthologs of the genes within all rodent specific clades in the tree  were not detectable in searches of the whole genome shotgun sequence data for the dog genome.  in contrast orthologs of all  <dig> primate genes were readily detectable in the dog genome sequence data , which supports the conclusion that the apparently rodent specific clades have indeed arisen more recently in the rodent lineage.

positive selection has acted in both primate and rodent lineages
significant evidence of selection was sought using three different programs: paml, adaptsite and swapsc. three pairs of paml site-specific likelihood models were compared that assume variable selective pressure  among sites: m <dig>  and m <dig> , m <dig>  and m <dig> , and m <dig>  and m <dig> . the m <dig> model  was a significantly better fit to the data than m <dig>  with the lrt statistic as follows: 2Δl =  <dig> =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  with  <dig> degrees of freedom . however subsequent bayesian analysis failed to identify any sites under positive selection with greater than 95% confidence. the lrt between m <dig> and m <dig> failed to show a significant difference in fit to the data. model m <dig> assumes a beta distribution for ω over  <dig> categories of sites. the beta distribution is limited to values between  <dig> and  <dig> providing the most flexible null hypothesis, and most stringent test, for testing positive selection. model m <dig> adds another site class to the m <dig> model, within which ω is estimated from the data. the m <dig> model suggested that a small proportion of sites were under strong positive selection , but again no specific sites were implicated as under positive selection in the subsequent bayesian analysis . an lrt showed that the m <dig> model allowing positive selection was a significantly better fit to the data than m7: 2Δl =  <dig> =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  with  <dig> degrees of freedom . in addition, m <dig> was the best fit to the data of all  <dig> site-specific models tested. these somewhat equivocal results are not unexpected for this data set. it is known that these lrts suffer from a lack of power to detect significant effects when divergence between sequences in the data set is low  <cit> . the levels of divergence between many of the primate sequences in this data set are often very low, and occasionally zero. nevertheless the lrts suggested that the best description of these data is a model incorporating many categories of variable ω including one showing positive selection. however, using this dataset, paml could not confidently  suggest the particular sites subject to positive selection. an earlier analysis of the  <dig> paralogous human β-defensins alone , and using the same lrts, demonstrated significant evidence for the operation of positive selection and  <dig> sites were nominated in more than one model  <cit> . the locations of these sites are shown in figure  <dig> 

to complement the analysis of semple et al.  <cit>  the same site-specific lrts were applied to an alignment of the mouse genes alone. in each case the models consistent with the presence of sites under positive selection were significantly better fits to the data than the paired null models. m <dig> was a better fit to the data than m <dig> with an lrt statistic 2Δl = 2) =  <dig>  and p <  <dig>  with  <dig> df. m <dig> was a better fit to the data than m1: 2Δl =  <dig> =  <dig>  and p <  <dig>  with  <dig> df. m <dig> was a better fit to the data than m7: 2Δl =  <dig> =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  with  <dig> df. again, m <dig> was the best fit to the data of all  <dig> site-specific models tested. in summary, these lrts indicated that ω varies significantly between sites among these mouse genes, and in every lrt the parameters estimated suggested a substantial proportion of sites are under positive selection. the parameters estimated were fairly consistent, with ω estimated to be between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and with this positive selection acting upon 34–50% of sites. seven particular sites were consistently implicated  as being under positive selection  with greater than 95% confidence.

the adaptsite analysis of these data was in general agreement with the lrt results described above: all three approaches  estimated a minority of sites  where dn > ds. however only the likelihood approach yielded statistically significant evidence for positively selected sites . this may be explicable by the greater sensitivity of the likelihood approach  <cit> . all three adaptsite approaches showed significant evidence for negative selection in a minority  of sites. the general picture that emerges from the adaptsite analysis suggests that positive selection has been more important than negative selection in mouse lineages and that the opposite is true of primate lineages.

the swapsc sliding window analysis of all mouse and primate data also broadly reflected the lrt results: the data set was estimated to contain sites subject to a wide range of ω values, including a small number under positive selection. specifically  <dig> % of the sites were estimated to be subject to positive selection and  <dig> % to negative selection. the branches identified as under positive and negative selection are indicated in figure  <dig> and reveal the dynamic evolutionary history of this locus. of the  <dig> primate genes examined, positive selection has played a role in the evolution of  <dig> and negative selection has acted upon all  <dig>  however the  <dig> genes at the orthologous rodent locus appear to have less turbulent histories, with  <dig> and  <dig> genes subject to positive and negative selection respectively. this leaves  <dig> mouse genes lacking significant evidence of either positive or negative selection. it is also notable that the majority  of mouse genes that have experienced detectable selection belong to apparently rodent specific clades in figure  <dig> .

selection in β-defensins varies spatially and temporally
the branches in the tree in figure  <dig> can be divided into three categories:  primate branches ;  rodent branches  but absent from the human and dog genomes);  more ancient branches . figure 2a provides an overview of the evolutionary dynamics within these three broad categories according to swapsc. it is clear that the selective episodes affecting primate genes have involved relatively low values of ω with many periods of negative selection while those affecting rodent genes have spanned a broader range of ω with few episodes of negative selection. more ancient branches seem to have involved the highest values of ω, which is consistent with the view that the early stages of duplication and diversification among mammalian β-defensin paralogs involved strong selection. the later stages of evolution within mammalian groups, and particularly primates, seem to have involved less innovation. figure 2b shows that the focus of most positive selection in rodent and ancient branches but also of negative selection in primate branches has been the first ~ <dig> bp of the alignment. these first  <dig> amino acids include the alpha helix and first beta strand of the mature defensin peptide  <cit> .

swapsc analysis suggests that in both primate and rodent lineages there have been episodes of selection in historically consecutive branches that have affected the same regions of these genes. for example in the primate lineage there was an episode of positive selection ~40– <dig> mya  which was followed by an episode of negative selection within the past ~ <dig>  million years , with both episodes affecting positions 109– <dig> in the alignment. similarly, a burst of positive selection during the evolution of the common ancestor of primate and rodent defb <dig>  was followed by negative selection at the same site  within the past  <dig>  my of primate evolution. primate evolution has also been marked by bouts of recurring negative selection at the same site, most clearly in the case of defb <dig>  here a site  within the alpha helix has been subject to negative selection on four occasions during the divergence of old world monkeys  from h. sapiens and p. troglodytes. this contrasts with the rodent lineage where only consecutive bursts of positive selection are seen to affect the same sites. within the rodent specific clade containing defb38/39/ <dig> two different sites are affected by positive selection, and each site has been targeted by selection at two points during their evolutionary past: positions 31– <dig> in the prepropeptide region at branches n and k; positions 109– <dig> in the second beta strand at branches l and m.

sites of ancient and relatively recent selection
swapsc found statistically significant support for positive and negative selection at many sites. figure  <dig> shows the raw data graphed for two of the branches  demonstrating significant evidence for positive selection . for each branch the ka and ks measured at successive  <dig> codon windows are shown. these graphs make clear that the sites of positive and negative selection identified as significant are likely to be a subset of those actually subject to these forces in reality. figure  <dig> is also typical of the results obtained for relatively recent and older branches  the recent branch shows the changes between the last common ancestor of c. aethiops  defb <dig> and p. anubis  defb <dig> and defb <dig> in c. aethiops. most regions of the molecule show little or no changes, as expected over ~ <dig>  my but two consecutive windows  demonstrate a significant excess of ka over ks. the older branch shows changes between the last common ancestor of all primate defb <dig> and mouse defb <dig> sequences and the ancestral primate defb <dig> sequence. this older branch concerns events ~40– <dig> mya and shows greater variation in ka and ks across the sequences, though only two regions show significant evidence for positive selection  and a further two for negative selection . there are many sites such as this where selection is detected similarly in all or most lineages, reflecting more ancient events in mammalian evolution. all except one of the conserved cysteine residues are implicated as being under negative selection in both primate and mouse lineages. similarly, a small region at the extreme n terminal of the mature peptides  was found to be under positive selection in primate and mouse lineages. however certain regions of these molecules have experienced positive and negative selection in different lineages. arguably it is these sites, where selection has at one time favoured a change but at another required stasis, that are likely to be most potent in altering the functions of these proteins. these sites mainly cluster at a central region of the mature peptides , although other sites, often those neighbouring cysteine residues , appear to have been subject to such opposing selection.

adaptsite  also nominated sites showing significant evidence of positive and negative selection and these can be compared with those nominated by swapsc and by paml run separately on mouse and primate datasets . however there are no sites in primates and only three in mouse  where all three programs show evidence for positive selection. this lack of agreement between all three programs is perhaps unsurprising considering the different restrictions of each analysis. swapsc can find lineage-specific events but relies on many simulated datasets to assess significance and lacks the single site resolution of the other two programs. paml was restricted here to examining selective episodes between paralogs and does not test for significant evidence of negative selection. adaptsite results are only reliable for alignments positions with more than  <dig> nucleotide differences  <cit> . in addition both adaptsite and paml do not consider gapped positions in the alignment, whereas swapsc will if the gap is absent from the lineage under examination. perhaps most importantly both the paml and adaptsite analyses discussed here examine site-specific events across the whole alignment under scrutiny, effectively averaging over lineages. figure  <dig> shows the level of agreement between any pair of programs and appears to indicate only modest agreement between them on the location of sites under positive selection. most of the positively selected primate sites  and mouse sites  implicated by paml are also supported by either swapsc or adaptsite. similarly most of the positively selected primate sites  and mouse sites  implicated by adaptsite are supported by at least one of the other programs. following the logic of podlaha and zhang  <cit>  such sites, supported by more than one independent analysis, are the most reliably inferred. however, this assertion assumes that the three methods used are similarly informative for the present dataset. significant heterogeneity between the results of the three methods might indicate they are not. a heterogeneity g-test  <cit>  was used to assess uniformity between the outcomes of the three tests  for positive selection. the numbers of sites predicted to be positively selected  were counted. it was necessary to consider all positively selected sites predicted for mouse and primate data together, and to collapse the first and final intervals to create intervals containing sufficient numbers of predicted sites . this calculation indicates that gh =  <dig>  with  <dig> degrees of freedom which is not significant. thus although the results of the three tests for positive selection used do not agree perfectly there is no significant heterogeneity between them.

structural implications of evolutionary history for β-defensin peptides
it has been shown that primate and murine β-defensins share striking similarity at the level of secondary and tertiary structure, in spite of very low levels of sequence similarity  <cit> . the most reliably inferred sites of selection in figure  <dig>  were mapped to the known structures of the human defb <dig> and the mouse defb <dig> mature peptides to examine differences in the distribution of these sites between primate and rodent lineages . as discussed above, there are more sites demonstrating positive selection in the murine defensins as compared to the primate defensins . however some clear similarities between the positions of positively selected sites are evident on the murine and primate structures . it seems that sites within the triple beta-strand so characteristic of these peptides are largely unaffected by positive selection. the few exceptional sites subject to positive selection found in the triple stranded β-sheets that form the structural core of the β-defensins, may represent alterations in the oligomerisation of β-defensins .

both primate and rodent lineages show a large number of sites subject to positive selection within the n-terminal portion of the mature peptide. two sites for both primate and murine, were located within a region which in defb <dig> and defb <dig> forms an alpha helix. since regions of proteins within membranes are often helical, with surfaces covered with hydrophobic resides, we speculate that the alpha helical section may be involved in anchoring the β-defensin to a bacterial cell wall. thus the sites within the alpha helix under positive selection may be significant in the specificity of β-defensins, either with respect to their antimicrobial or chemoattractant properties. the longest loop region of these peptides  also contains sites of positive selection. for the murine form this loop is almost exclusively subject to high selection, which suggests that this part of the structure has a key functional role in these small peptides. if, as shown for the β-defensin hnp <dig>  <cit>  the second beta-strand is involved in oligerimisation, many of these sites would all be left exposed after dimer formation, suggesting an rapidly diverging exposed 'skirt' around the peptide. this is confimed by the nmr data of schibli et al.  <cit>  whose structures of the human β-defensin defb <dig> suggest symmetrical dimer formation, through the beta strand  <dig> of the β-sheet.

some sites found to be subject to positive selection in rodents  are not represented in figure  <dig> as they are part of the n-terminal prepropeptide region that is removed to produce the mature peptide. this contrasts with studies of α-defensins which have found an absence of positively selected sites in the prepropeptide region  <cit> . in primate lineages sites within the prepropeptide region have undergone negative selection . these observations strongly imply that the prepropeptide region is more important to β-defensin function than has previously been appreciated.

discussion
the present data demonstrated evidence for positive and negative selection in different branches but at overlapping regions of the same molecules. it is clear that in such a case the use of site specific lrts  may have little power to detect the sites involved. a combined approach, using such lrts with an independent method  examining each branch individually has previously been employed in an analysis of α-defensins  <cit> . here we have extended this approach to examine ancient and more recent events in primate β-defensin evolution.

it is thought that positive selection may play a major role in the divergence of paralogues from one another following a duplication event  <cit> . in agreement with this many of the more ancient selective episodes detected here appear to date back to the birth of these genes by duplication at an ancestral mammalian locus. however it is striking that later episodes of positive selection often focus on sites overlapping those subject to the more ancient events, particularly in the rodent lineage. this suggests that many of the same sites that originally conferred specificity of function upon these peptides were altered to provide novel functions many millions of years later. although in the primate lineage it would appear that the original episodes of positive selection following duplication were usually followed by negative selection.

boniotto et al.  <cit>  found some evidence for positive selection in human defb <dig> during the divergence of primate species. they reported several residues of interest in the mature peptide where substitutions were observed in primate groups other than the great apes. these n-terminal residues are concerned with oligomerisation in the human peptide and they suggested that a particular form of oligomerisation might have evolved in apes and humans. we detected no significant positive selection in defb <dig> since the divergence of the same primate groups, although our analysis is conservative. however the only statistical evidence presented by boniotto et al.  <cit>  to support their hypothesis that defb <dig> is subject to positive selection was a z-test, which is not stringent enough for short sequences such as these.

a consequence of the more rigorous statistical analyses to which we subject the sequences described here is that we may miss real episodes of positive selection. antcheva et al.  <cit>  synthesised variant molecules based on their observation that defb <dig>  has been subject to positive selection during the divergence of various primate lineages. they synthesised the m. fascicularis defb <dig> orthologue  and a variant of the human peptide lacking asp, hbd2", which is characteristic only of the human/great ape peptides. hbd <dig> and mfabd <dig> showed a significant difference in specificity, the former being more active towards escherichia coli and the later towards staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans. asp in the human peptide appears to be important, as hbd <dig> was less structured and had a markedly lower antimicrobial activity but this site was not identified as being subject to positive selection here. a clear but unexpected result of the present analyses was that the preproregion has been subject to significant positive selection in rodents and negative selection in primates. this has not been observed previously. it is commonly assumed that the preproregion is cleaved as the mature peptide is secreted from the cell. we conclude that further investigations of cleavage and the functional consequences of sequence changes in this region are merited.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used a combination of maximum likelihood based tests and a maximum parsimony based sliding window approach to give the most statistically rigorous and detailed view of the selective history at the major primate β-defensin locus. these data shed light on the evolution of human innate immunity but also have practical applications in the design of novel antibiotics. sites within the active, mature peptides have been subject to repeated episodes of selection in different primate lineages, and by implication are important in functional diversity. additional sites within the prepropeptide region, which is cleaved before secretion, were also subject to selection suggesting a previously unappreciated functional significance of this region.
