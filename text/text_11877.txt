BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an adaptable and resilient gram-negative bacterium found ubiquitously in the environment  that is capable of infecting a wide range of organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrate eukaryotes, and plants  <cit> . in humans, it is responsible for causing keratitis, burn wound infections, and severe chronic respiratory infections in patients with underlying diseases such as cystic fibrosis  or bronchiectasis  <cit> . the ubiquitous nature of p. aeruginosa and range of diseases is likely due in part to high genome plasticity  <cit> .

bronchiectasis is a pulmonary disease characterized by dilated bronchi, airway inflammation, chronic sputum production, and long-term bacterial colonization resulting in frequent exacerbations of bacterial infections  <cit> . chronic p. aeruginosa infections in these patients are often associated with a worsening of symptoms, decreased pulmonary function, and increased frequency of exacerbations  <cit> . once established, these infections are difficult to treat with antibiotics. the chronic lung inflammation, airflow obstruction, and extensive tissue remodeling found in the lungs of bronchiectasis patients resemble those of patients with cf or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   <cit> . the adaptation of p. aeruginosa to the cf lung has been extensively studied during the past decade ; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the persistence of this bacterium in the lungs of patients with bronchiectasis.

a model describing the increased fitness in a chronic infection has been previously established  and this process can be enhanced by mutations to the various dna proofreading systems, result in an increased mutation rate. during chronic cf infections, p. aeruginosa “hypermutators” can be isolated from  <dig> to 54 % of the patients  <cit> . muts, a critical component of the mismatch repair system  <cit> , is commonly lost in hypermutator strains  <cit> , resulting in elevated mutation rates  <cit> . p. aeruginosa hypermutator strains isolated from chronically infected patients, including those with bronchiectasis  <cit> , are often more resistant to antibiotics, possess a mucoid phenotype, as well as loss of lipopolysaccharide  o-antigen and motility  <cit> .

in this work, we have determined the genome sequence and characterized numerous phenotypes of p. aeruginosa strain pahm <dig>  a hypermutator from a chronic bronchiectasis infection that has been the subject of previous research  <cit> . this strain has several unique dna islands and characteristics that may have facilitated the persistence of the microorganism in the lung. while this strain shares some traits with chronic cf isolates, it also differs from cf isolates in numerous ways, potentially highlighting differences between the cf lung and the bronchiectasis lung. by identifying key characteristics required for specific lung infections such as the expression of specific virulence factors, antigens or antibiotic resistance genes, it may be possible to identify drug targets specific to each type of infection. these findings have the potential to aid in the development of infection-specific treatments for p. aeruginosa.

RESULTS
virulence phenotypes of p. aeruginosa pahm <dig> differ from those of cf and laboratory isolates
p. aeruginosa pahm <dig> has been previously studied due to its constitutive trimethylation of ef-tu, which mimics platelet activating factor and binds to platelet activating factor receptor  <cit> . during these investigations, other interesting phenotypes of this strain, such as mucoidy and hypermutation, were observed when compared to chronic cf or laboratory isolates prompting an in depth characterization of the strain.

adhesion and invasion assays indicated that pahm <dig> and other bronchiectasis isolates differed from acute lung infection and chronic cf isolates. strains isolated from acute infections displayed a significantly higher adhesion  and invasion  capacity compared to strains isolated from patients with bronchiectasis  or cystic fibrosis . pahm <dig> adhesion and invasion capacity was low, likely due to its hyper-mucoid phenotype, but not significantly different from the other bronchiectasis isolates. interestingly, we observed that overall adhesion and invasion of these bronchiectasis isolates was significantly lower  than the isolates from cf infections, suggesting that adaptation of p. aeruginosa isolates to the lung of patients with bronchiectasis results in the selection of different phenotypes.fig.  <dig> 
in vitro models of infection. adhesion  and invasion  assays of individual clinical isolates from patients with acute pulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, or cf. type ii pneumocytes a <dig> cells monolayers were infected with  <dig> x <dig> cfu and the percentage of adhered and invaded cells was measured using a standard gentamycin exclusion assay. pahm <dig> is highlighted on the graphs in red. experiments were performed in triplicate. c. macrophage uptake  and killing  were performed using murine bone marrow macrophages extracted from balb/c mice and grown in presence of l-cells conditioned medium for 5 days. macrophages were infected with pao <dig>  pa <dig> or pahm <dig> at a moi 500: <dig>  experiments were performed in duplicate. d. in vitro infection of lettuce leaves. the midrib of romaine lettuce was infected with a bacterial suspension of 106 cfu of pao <dig>  pa <dig> or pahm <dig> and incubated at ambient temperature for 48 h. the diameter of the soft rot area at the site of inoculation was measured. experiments were performed in triplicate. for all experiments, data were analyzed using an unpaired two-tailed t-test and the software graphpad prism  <dig> 



the capacity of pahm <dig> to evade phagocytosis and to survive intracellularly in macrophages was also examined. naïve bone marrow-derived macrophages from balb/c mice were infected with  <dig>  x 108 cfu/well  of p. aeruginosa. intracellular bacteria were quantified after 15 min incubation to measure uptake, or a 90 min incubation to measure intracellular survival. no significant difference in macrophage uptake was observed between the different strains tested . after 90 min incubation, the number of live intracellular pao <dig> and pahm <dig> did not significantly change  compared to the number of intracellular bacteria after 15 min, whereas the number of live pa <dig> had tripled . intracellular pahm <dig> populations were maintained during the length of the experiments, indicating that pahm <dig> is resistant to murine macrophage killing in this experimental setting similar to pao <dig>  but in contrast to the pa <dig> population that increased during the course of the experiment .

lettuce leaves were infected with pao <dig> , pa <dig>  and pahm <dig>  to investigate the virulence of these p. aeruginosa strains in an environmental setting. in this model, pahm <dig> displayed a significantly decreased capacity of infection compared to pao <dig> and pa <dig> .

biofilm production is thought to be a hallmark of chronic colonization of the cf lung  <cit> , having been indirectly  <cit>  and directly  <cit>  observed in cf sputum and lungs. accordingly, the capacity of pahm <dig> to form biofilms in rich media , with and without supplementation with iron and/or glycerol, was determined and compared to pao <dig>  pao <dig> formed significantly more biofilm than pahm <dig> in lysogeny broth  , in the presence of glycerol  and iron  . it is important to note that while pahm <dig> exhibited slower growth than pao <dig> in lb with shaking at 37 °c , it has been reported that growth rate does not necessarily influence biofilm formation  <cit> . biofilm formation can be variable in individual cf isolates, even well studied strains like lesb <dig>  which has variously been reported as hyper-  <cit> , hypo-  <cit> , or an equivalent-  <cit>  producer of biofilms compared to pao <dig> fig.  <dig> biofilm formation in pahm <dig>  measurement of biofilm formation of pao <dig>  and pahm <dig>  grown for 24 h in rich media  either unsupplemented or with glycerol, iron, or iron and glycerol added. *, p <  <dig> . error bars represent the standard deviation of biological and technical replicates



p. aeruginosa secretes numerous enzymatic virulence factors, including proteases, elastase, and hemolysins. p. aeruginosa proteolysis is due to secretion of a type iv protease, elastase, and an alkaline protease. quantitative casein degradation assays indicated that pahm <dig> had significantly less general protease activity than pa <dig> and pao <dig> . the elastase lasb is involved in the disruption of tight junctions, and the cleavage of numerous proteins including surfactants, cytokines, chemokines, c <dig>  and immunoglobulin  <cit> . elastase activity, as measured by the degradation of elastin-congo red elastin, was significantly decreased in pahm <dig> compared to pa <dig> and significantly more than pao <dig> . while protease and elastase levels vary between pao <dig> and pa <dig>  pahm <dig> seems to have reduced overall protease levels while retaining elevated elastase activity compared to pao <dig>  this contrasts typical mucoid cf isolates that routinely lose elastase activity  in addition to having reduced levels of general protease activity  <cit> .fig.  <dig> protease and elastase assays. a pahm <dig>  pao <dig>  and pa <dig> were grown overnight in lb and filtered culture supernatants were added to an azocasein solution. after incubation, trichloroacetic acid was added to precipitate the remaining proteins and the od <dig> was measured. data presented are the od495/od <dig> of the overnight culture. b elastase assays were performed by adding the filtered culture supernatant to an elastin-congo red solution and measuring the od <dig> after 2 h. all assays were performed in triplicate, and the mean is plotted with error bars representing the standard deviation. based on tukey’s multiple comparison test: *, p =  <dig> ,**, p =  <dig> , ****, p = <  <dig> 



p. aeruginosa hemolysis is due to two hemolytic extracellular products: phospholipase c, a heat-labile hemolysin, and a rhamnolipid, a heat-stable hemolysin. assessment of the hemolytic capacity of pahm <dig> after growth for 24 h on blood-agar plates indicates the presence of β-hemolysis activity in pahm <dig>  <cit>  .

pahm <dig> phenotypes in common with cf isolates
despite these differences when compared to p. aeruginosa laboratory strains and previously reported for cf isolates, pahm <dig> and cf isolates have several phenotypes in common including mucoidy, hyper-mutation, loss of motility, and an extensive antibiotic resistance profile.

pahm <dig> colonies appeared to be mucoid under typical growth conditions, similar to chronic cf isolates. quantification of alginate indicates that pahm <dig> produces  <dig> times more alginate that pao <dig> in the tested conditions, with an average of  <dig>  μg / 109 cfu .

to characterize the hypermutator phenotype in pahm <dig>  the frequency of emergence of rifampicin-resistance was used to calculate the mutation rate . wild-type pao <dig> had a mutant frequency of  <dig>  x 10− <dig> and a mutation rate of  <dig>  x 10− <dig> mutations/cell/generation, while a Δmuts isogenic strain, paoms, showed a  <dig> -fold increase in mutation rate . the mutant frequency and mutation rate of pahm <dig> were equivalent to the pao <dig> Δmuts strain, and complementation of pahm <dig> with muts from pao <dig> reduced the mutant frequency and mutation rate by nearly  <dig> logs , leaving a residual 10-fold increase in mutation rate. this indicates that the muts mutation is the major cause of the hypermutation phenotype observed in pahm <dig>  similar to what is seen in cf isolates  <cit> .table  <dig>

it is possible that the remaining increase in mutation rate in the muts complemented strain was due mutations in mutl or muty. to test this hypothesis, plasmids encoding wild-type mutl and muty were used to measure the change in mutation frequency. in contrast to muts, complementation with wild-type mutl or muty had no effect on mutant frequency and mutation rate, suggesting a marginal impact, if any, of mutations to these genes in pahm <dig> 

the loss of both flagellar- and type iv pilus - mediated motility is often observed in chronic cf isolates  <cit> . a phenotypic switch to non-motility has also been noted in copd isolates  <cit> . compared to pao <dig> and pa <dig>  pahm <dig> was defective for flagellar motility on semisolid media  and twitching motility  . these results are similar to those seen in lesb <dig>  which has been reported to be defective in swimming and swarming motility  <cit> , while totally lacking twitching motility  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phenotypic analysis of pahm <dig>  visualization of swimming, swarming and twitching motility in media containing  <dig>  % agarose,  <dig>  % agar and  <dig>  % agar, respectively. motility was assessed after 48 h at 37 °c and experiments were performed in triplicate



patients with a chronic respiratory infection are subject to heavy antibiotic treatment. the survival of p. aeruginosa in the chronically infected lung is often associated with an increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. pahm <dig> is clinically resistant to penicillins  and aminoglycosides  . this strain also displays significantly higher levels of resistance to cephalosporins, including cefotaxime and monobactams, and fluoroquinolones, when compared to pao <dig>  however, pahm <dig> has increased susceptibility to carbapenems , polymyxins, macrolides and tetracycline compared to pao <dig> . intermediate resistance levels to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin in pahm <dig> are most likely associated with the prolonged use of these antibiotics for the treatment of this patient.table  <dig> mic values for common clinical antibiotics against pahm <dig> and pao1

penicillin, cephalosporin and monobactam resistance is most likely due to the activity of the inducible β-lactamase ampc encoded by ampc on the chromosome of p. aeruginosa. high resistance levels to these β-lactams are often associated in p. aeruginosa clinical isolates with mutations in the genes ampd and dacb, encoding ampd, a repressor of ampc expression, and the penicillin binding protein  <dig>  respectively. in other strains, mutations in ampd and dacb result in the derepression of ampc expression  <cit> . mutation of dacb additionally derepresses the expression of cred through the activation of the crebc two-component regulator, contributing further to β-lactams resistance  <cit> . to address these considerations, a series of reverse transcription-quantitative pcr  assays were performed to probe the nature of antibiotic resistance in pahm <dig>  our data indicate that ampc and cred basal expression in pahm <dig> are significantly higher than in pao <dig> , and that ampc expression in pahm <dig> is not inducible. these results indicate that the expression of ampc is fully derepressed, a phenomenon often observed in gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients undergoing therapy with third-generation cephalosporins, such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime  <cit> .table  <dig> rt-qpcr expression levels of antibiotic determinants

genome sequence determination of pahm4
given the interesting mix of phenotypes observed in pahm <dig>  the genome sequence was determined, allowing for the identification of the genetic basis for the observed phenotypes, as well as potentially identifying additional unique features of a non-cf p. aeruginosa lung isolate. sequence determination resulted in an apparent genome size of  <dig> ,186 bp encoding  <dig> putative orfs and  <dig> structural rnas. the genome sequence and protein sequences used for all downstream analyses are included as additional file 1: data file  <dig> and additional file 2: data file  <dig>  respectively. the pahm <dig> genome has a size, coding density, and % g + c similar to other p. aeruginosa strains . mlst analysis indicates that pahm <dig> belongs to p. aeruginosa mlst clone st- <dig>  <cit> , which is comprised of  <dig> strains included in the mlst database . ten of eleven strains of this mlst type were isolated from cf patients in france or australia, suggesting a propensity of this clonal lineage for developing chronic infections, while the other was a canine isolate.table  <dig> genomic characteristics of select p. aeruginosa strains

genome plasticity and a large accessory genome are keys for adaptation of p. aeruginosa to a wide range of environments  <cit> . circular genome comparisons generated with brig  <cit>  that show large scale differences between the p. aeruginosa genomes are included as additional file 3: data file  <dig>  using pao <dig> as the reference, and additional file 4: data file  <dig>  using a pahm <dig> pseudochromosome as the reference. to understand the extent of genome plasticity in pahm <dig>  and the potential role it played in adaptation to the bronchiectasis lung, panseq  <cit>  was used to compare the genome of pahm <dig> to the  <dig> reference strains listed in table  <dig> 

these comparisons revealed that pahm <dig> has at least  <dig> genome islands , ranging in size from  <dig> –  <dig>  bp, containing  <dig>  bp of dna not found in other analyzed p. aeruginosa strains. nineteen of these gis, totaling  <dig>  bp, had no significant blastn hits  in the non-redundant database as of 7/1/ <dig> 

pahm <dig> dna regions that were not present in other p. aeruginosa strains were analyzed with blastx to identify potential proteins. numerous regions of interest were identified, including prophage, a serotype o <dig> lps o-antigen locus, several type  <dig> secretion system  loci, putative virulence factors, metabolic genes, fimbriae and pili, and a putative steroid degradation cluster . this latter region consists of  <dig> orfs that have high dna and protein similarity to a steroid degradation gene cluster identified in pseudomonas resinovorans . as inhaled steroids have historically seen use as supportive treatment for bronchiectasis  <cit>  the presence of this cluster in pahm <dig> is intriguing as it suggests that this bacteria may be able to utilize steroids as an energy source, which might in turn negate the effectiveness of this treatment.

panseq also identified commonly occurring dna sequences from p. aeruginosa strains that were absent from the pahm <dig> genome. this analysis identified  <dig> segments of dna comprising  <dig>  bp that were present in all seven other analyzed strains and missing in pahm <dig> . the two largest clusters accounted for ~33 % of the total common dna absent from pahm <dig> . the first large deletion in the pahm <dig> genome spans pao <dig> orfs pa <dig> and pa <dig> and includes the lasir quorum sensing  system . the second large deletion includes pao <dig> orfs pa2128-pa <dig>  of these, pa2128-pa <dig> have previously been reported to be involved in biofilm formation  <cit>  and under the control of the transcriptional regulator rpon in a mucoid strain of p. aeruginosa  <cit> . these genes are also involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and their loss might be the result of the metabolic adaptation of pahm <dig> to chronic infection, as described below.

bacterial genomes often contain prophages or prophage-like elements which can differ between individual isolates of the same species and provide valuable information on bacterial evolution. prophages mediate horizontal transfer of genetic material through transduction and provide important biological properties to their hosts. large, apparently intact but not necessarily complete prophage sequences were identified using phast  <cit>  while prophagefinder  <cit>  was used to more aggressively analyze p. aeruginosa genomes for potential prophage content in the form of degraded phage genomes. similar to observations in other p. aeruginosa strains, pahm <dig> had several common prophage as well as a complement of unique sequences .

genome analysis identified several phenotypes common to pahm <dig> and cf isolates
above, we have shown that hyper-mutation of pahm <dig> is primarily the result of a deficiency in muts. sequence analysis of the muts locus in p. aeruginosa pahm <dig> revealed a  <dig>  bp orf which has 98 % identity to pao <dig> muts . compared to pao <dig>  muts from pahm <dig> has several snps and an 1184del <dig> mutation. alignment of the resulting pahm <dig> protein to the pao <dig> protein identifies two changes: s281g and Δt395_g <dig>  warren and colleagues identified a p. aeruginosa isolate from a chronic infection that also possessed the s281g mutation and additional isolates in which muts was truncated at residue  <dig>  <cit> . blastp analysis indicates that the specific three residue deletion in pahm <dig> is a unique occurrence among muts from p. aeruginosa strains and other members of the genus  <cit> .

as described above, pahm <dig> over-produces alginate. this phenotype is often associated with the establishment of chronic respiratory infections by p. aeruginosa. pahm <dig> muca contains a Δg <dig> mutation, causing a premature stop codon and resulting in a mutant allele commonly referred to as muca <dig>  <cit> . muca <dig> strains are constitutively mucoid, and this is the apparent cause of alginate overproduction by pahm <dig>  <cit> . in the lungs of patients with cf, 85 % of mucoid p. aeruginosa isolates have mutations in muca  <cit> , with muca <dig> being the most common allele  <cit> .

in addition to alginate, p. aeruginosa strains produce other exo-polysaccharides known as pel and psl  <cit> . pahm <dig> encodes an intact pel locus while the psl locus has an assembly gap within psll.

p. aeruginosa strains produce a variety of serotype-specific o-antigen side chains on lipopolysaccharide  . the o-antigen are used as the basis for a typing scheme based on antibody agglutination  <cit>  and each serotype has a corresponding genotype  <cit> . blast analysis of the pahm <dig> genome using the o-antigen locus sequences from raymond et al.  <cit>  identified a  <dig>  bp region in pahm <dig> with  <dig>  % identity to serotype o <dig> . the pahm <dig> locus possesses two 1-bp insertions compared to serotype o <dig>  the first disrupts orf <dig>  introducing several premature stop codons while the second is intergenic and does not appear to influence any genes . strains corresponding to several serotypes  have been sequenced, however no serotype o <dig> strain has had its genome sequence determined and published. chronic cf isolates are known to frequently lose the o-antigen from lps, which is proposed to aid in immune evasion . proq staining of lps preparations from pao <dig> and pahm <dig> revealed faint lps banding . it was anticipated that this might be the common antigen portion of lps, and a western blot using anti-common antigen mab demonstrated the presence of common antigen in pahm <dig> . as expected given the mutation in orf <dig>  western blotting of the lps preps using o <dig> antibodies did not indicate the presence of any o <dig> antigen .fig.  <dig> o-antigen biosynthetic locus and lps expression in pahm <dig>  a genetic comparison of lps o-antigen biosynthetic regions of serotype o <dig>  and pahm <dig> . gene names are as described by raymond et al.  <cit> . stars denote the location of insertions in pahm <dig> relative to the serotype o <dig> reference sequence. b proq emerald  <dig> lipopolysaccharide gel stain of pao <dig> and pahm <dig> lps preparations. c western blot of pao <dig> and pahm <dig> lps preparations, probed with anti-common antigen antibodies. d western blot of serotype o <dig> and pahm <dig> lps preparations, probed with anti-o <dig> antibodies



lipid a produced by pahm <dig> after growth at 37 °c in lb with 1 mm mgcl <dig> was purified for structural analysis by maldi-tof ms in the negative ion mode. results indicated that pahm <dig> displayed lipid a species characteristic of p. aeruginosa . the most abundant anion giving the base peak at m/z  <dig> corresponded to a singly deprotonated hexa-acylated lipid a . specifically, pamh <dig> synthesizes a hexa-acylated lipid a species containing hydroxylated fatty acids  attached acyl-oxo-acyl at the  <dig> and 2’ positions, as well as the retention of the 3oh-c <dig> fatty acid at the  <dig> position. the minor anion at m/z  <dig>  represents the loss of the  <dig> position 3oh c <dig> fatty acid from the m/z  <dig> peak  , whereas the m/z  <dig>  represents a structure that is only modified by a single hydroxyl group  . as compared to the structure of lipid a isolated from the laboratory adapted strains, pak and pao <dig>  the lipid a produced by pahm <dig> showed increased hydroxylation  and acylation. when compared to lipid a from a typical cf strain pahm <dig> has a different hydroxylation pattern and lacks the addition of aminoarabinose  <cit> . the increased susceptibility of pahm <dig> to polymyxins  may be explained by the loss of the specific o-antigen, as suggested by earlier salmonella studies  <cit>  or by the alterations to lipid a  <cit> .fig.  <dig> lipid a analysis of pahm <dig>  ms analysis  revealed major lipid a species present at m/z  <dig>  with minor species m/z  <dig>  and m/z  <dig> . other ions present represent monophosphoryl species , previously identified penta-acylated lipid a , as well as non-hydroxylated lipid a . ions m/z  <dig> and m/z  <dig> have not been previously identified



genetic basis for antibiotic resistance
as described earlier, pahm <dig> has resistance to many antibiotics, and trends in expression levels of resistance genes were similar to what is seen in chronic cf isolates. the genome sequence allows for identification of the basis for the observed resistances.

the high level of ampc and cred over-expression are consistent with pahm <dig> sequence data showing changes present in ampd  and dacb  compared to pao <dig>  previous work showed that inactivation of these genes leads to a complete derepression of ampc expression  <cit> . mexb has a Δc <dig> mutation, with the resulting frameshift causing a premature stop codon. these results are consistent with the meropenem hyper-susceptibility of this strain and, compared to pao <dig>  the relatively low increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations  for several of the β-lactams  despite the high level of ampc expression. altogether, low levels of mexb expression and the mutation observed in this gene, which are presumably responsible for a non-functional protein, might account for the lower mics of tetracycline and azithromycin of this strain. the sequences of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare were analyzed in order to determine the source of fluoroquinolone resistance. analysis identified a point mutation resulting in gyra having a d87y substitution that resides within the quinolone resistance determining region of the protein. this mutation, related to high levels of fluoroquinolone resistance, frequently occurs in cf isolates  <cit> . other point mutations were observed in genes encoding parc  and pare , the latter being often associated with the gyra d87y substitution in p. aeruginosa clinical isolates  <cit> , and possibly associated with the high quinolone resistance levels of the strain. the gyrb sequence in pahm <dig> is identical to the pao <dig> sequence. the selection of mutations in gyra, parc, and para, is likely the result of the use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the patient.

pahm <dig> has a deficiency for acyl homoserine lactone -based quorum sensing
qs in p. aeruginosa is a well characterized phenomenon  that controls the expression of approximately 10 % of the genes in p. aeruginosa and is known to control virulence factor expression in p. aeruginosa as well as other microbial pathogens . it has previously been reported that p. aeruginosa hypermutator strains frequently developed mutations in the lasir qs system  <cit> .

as described above, sequence analysis indicated that a large chromosomal deletion in pahm <dig> includes lasi and lasr. the rhlir system is present and the resulting proteins are 99 % and 100 % identical, respectively, to the homologs in pao <dig>  culture supernatants of late stationary phase pahm <dig> and pao <dig> samples were tested for the production of both p. aeruginosa autoinducers, c4-ahl  and 3-oxo-c12-ahl  using rhlr and lasr based quorum sensing-responsive reporters  <cit> . as expected, pao <dig> culture supernatants activated both reporters, indicating the production of c4-ahl and 3-oxo-c12-ahl . pahm <dig> supernatant did not activate either reporter , indicating an absence of both autoinducers; this was a surprising result given the intact state of the rhlir genes. the cf isolate lesb <dig> belongs to a lineage known for increased c4-ahl production leading to over-production of qs-linked virulence factors and hyper-virulence  <cit> . however, the contrasting observations in pahm <dig> are in line with findings from the longitudinal analysis of chronic cf isolates which indicated that typically p. aeruginosa strains would first lose las activity while eventually also losing rhl activity  <cit> . one mechanism for this is that the muca <dig> allele, which is also present in pahm <dig>  has been shown to be required for full expression of rhlir and lasir  <cit> . additionally, it is quite possible that the loss of detectable c4-ahl is influenced by base changes elsewhere on the chromosome.fig.  <dig> presence of ahls in pahm <dig> culture supernatant. measurement of the production of c4-acyl homoserine lactone and c12-acyl homoserine lactone using the pao <dig> rhl reporter pec <dig>  and las reporters pjn <dig> and psc <dig>  respectively in pao <dig>  and pahm <dig> 



pahm <dig> has an expanded arsenal of protein secretion apparatuses compared to other p. aeruginosa strains
bacterial secretion systems play a major role in the export of proteins involved in virulence, nutrient scavenging, and immune evasion. the genome of pahm <dig> was screened for the presence of p. aeruginosa secretion systems in order to understand the role of these systems in the adaptation of this strain to the chronic bronchiectasis lung.

pahm <dig> contains four major operons encoding two distinct type  <dig> secretion systems  that are present in the majority of p. aeruginosa strains. pahm <dig> also contains a putative operon encoding a 3rd t2ss . this gene cluster shows ~90 % identity to the recently characterized txc t2ss that had previously only been identified in the genome of p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  <cit> . intriguingly, the ncbi non-redundant database only contains several high quality matches to this sequence  with the closest match after pa <dig> belonging to the mosquito, culex pipiens quinquefasciatus  <cit> . this may be the result of an ancient horizontal gene transfer event between an endosymbiotic bacterium and the mosquito  <cit> .fig.  <dig> t2ss in pahm <dig> and pa <dig>  pahm <dig> and pa <dig> encode a novel t2ss cluster that appears to have inserted between a two- component response regulator  and a hypothetical protein . the gene pairing of pa <dig> and pa <dig> homologs is maintained in other p. aeruginosa strains and sequences homologous to this t2ss are only found in culex pipiens quinquefasciatus




another protein secretion mechanism important to p. aeruginosa virulence is the t6ss, which is a relatively recently described mechanism of protein export that is present in a wide array of gram-negative bacteria. the t6ss complex requires numerous proteins for assembly of the apparatus and effector export . like other p. aeruginosa strains, pahm <dig> encodes the canonical t6ss loci hcp <dig> secretion island- <dig> , hsi- <dig>  and hsi- <dig>  <cit> . in pahm <dig>  hsi- <dig>  hsi- <dig> and his- <dig> are encoded on three separate contigs with over 98 % dna identity to pa <dig> .table  <dig> t6ss present in pahm4



protein predictions indicate the presence of an additional t6ss system in pahm <dig> located in a region of dna not previously identified in p. aeruginosa strains that has homology to the p. putida genome. the majority of proteins in this cluster have homology to the type  <dig>  t6ss cluster from p. putida  <cit> . this cluster is evolutionarily related to hsi- <dig> from p. aeruginosa but has never been detected outside of p. putida  <cit> , suggesting that pahm <dig> obtained it in a horizontal gene transfer event. interestingly, this cluster contains several additional orfs not seen in p. putida, and the predicted proteins showed homology to pseudomonas extremaustralis, a species isolated from thawed ice in antarctica  <cit> , and numerous other marine bacterial species, indicating a potential reservoir for this t6ss system.

pahm <dig> encodes a robust assortment of homologs of hcp and vgrg, secreted factors and structural components of t6ss . pahm <dig> is missing several conserved p. aeruginosa hcp and vgrg genes, but encodes additional homologs not found in pao <dig> or pa <dig> .

pahm <dig> has a mix of novel and common cellular appendage alleles
p. aeruginosa cells are equipped with several appendages known to affect motility, biofilms, and adherence. given the various phenotypes identified in pahm <dig>  the genes encoding these systems were investigated.

type iv pili  are bacterial filaments typically composed of repeating monomers , which are known to have multiple functions in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including motility  <cit>  and biofilm formation  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa tfp have known roles in twitching motility  <cit> , biofilm formation  <cit> , disease pathogenesis  <cit> , and phage uptake  <cit> .

p. aeruginosa produces two types of tfp: type iva  and type ivb  . additionally, it has been shown that there are at least five distinct pilin alleles for tfpa pilin, identified by the genes inserted between trna-thr and pila  <cit> , known collectively as group i-v. pahm <dig>  like pao <dig>  <cit> , encodes the group ii tfpa allele which lacks accessory genes downstream of pila  <cit>  . group ii tfpa is the most common allele identified in non-cf clinical isolates while group i makes up the majority of cf isolates  <cit> . p. aeruginosa strains also produce numerous minor pilins, encoded in an island downstream of the tfpa cluster  <cit> . the minor pilins in pahm <dig>  encoded by fimu, and pilvwxe, are nearly 100 % identical to the pilins encoded by a diverse set of strains including pao <dig>  pa <dig>  c <dig>  and ngcm <dig> s <dig> .table  <dig> analysis of tfp clusters in pahm4

the pahm <dig> genome contains the prototypical tfpb cluster seen in pa <dig> that encodes a bundle-forming pilus  <cit> . when compared to pa <dig>  the coding sequence for this cluster was 99 % identical and all genes were intact. pahm <dig> also contains a second tfpb cluster associated with the papi- <dig> element found in a subset of p. aeruginosa strains, including pa <dig>  <cit> . pahm <dig> assembly <dig> contains a region with 98 % identity to a region spanning pill <dig> to pilm <dig> in pa <dig>  with all orfs intact. this tfpb pilus is known to be required for the transmission of papi- <dig>  <cit> , indicating that pahm <dig> may retain the ability to transmit its papi-1-like element.

in addition to tfp, another surface filament present on p. aeruginosa cells is the chaperone-usher-pathway  fimbriae. p. aeruginosa strains are known to encode multiple, conserved, cup systems  <cit> . pahm <dig> and pa <dig> are missing the cupa cluster and have distinct unique alleles for cupb and cupc . the cupa cluster is located within one of the large chromosomal deletions in pahm <dig>  while in pa <dig> the deletion is small and primarily consists of the cupa cluster . the papi-1-associated cupd is absent in pahm <dig> while cupe is conserved. cupa, cupb and cupc have been shown to be required for biofilm formation  <cit>  while cupe was shown to be required more specifically for the early phases of biofilm formation  <cit> . it is intriguing that pahm <dig> and pa <dig> introduce new alleles of cupb and cupc while every other analyzed p. aeruginosa strain had an identical or nearly identical set of alleles.table  <dig> cup cluster composition of p. aeruginosa strains

p. aeruginosa expresses a single polar flagellum which exhibits a conserved structure established for many gram-negative microorganisms. this flagellum is involved in motility and pathogenesis, promoting the attachment of the bacterium to the surface of epithelial cells. genetic analysis of pahm <dig> indicates that most flagellar biosynthesis genes in this bacterium are highly conserved compared to pao <dig> including the genes flgbcdefghijkl, fleqsr, fliefghijklmnopqr, flhb, flhafn, flia and motcd.

most p. aeruginosa isolates express one of two types of flagella  based on the deduced amino acid sequences of the major structural gene flic, encoding the flagellin filament  <cit> . p. aeruginosa flagella also have two potential types of glycosylation which occur in a strain-dependent fashion  <cit> . pao <dig>  lesb <dig>  c <dig> and pa <dig> all have type b flagellin and type b glycosylation alleles while the type a flagellin and type a glycosylation alleles present in pahm <dig> have also been described in strains pak, pa <dig>  ncgm <dig> s <dig>  <cit> , and are common in p. aeruginosa clinical isolates from patients with cf  <cit> .

characterization of secondary metabolite capacity in pahm4
putative secondary metabolite clusters were identified with antismash  <cit> . pahm <dig> was predicted to encode the clusters common to most p. aeruginosa strains. however, a pahm <dig> gene cluster that is predicted to produce 3-oxobutanal is shared with m <dig> and pa- <dig> but absent in other sequenced p. aeruginosa strains.

acquisition of iron and zinc in vivo contributes greatly to p. aeruginosa metabolism and is crucial for the pathogenesis of this bacterium  <cit> . p. aeruginosa strains produce two siderophores, pyochelin and pyoverdine , and pahm <dig> encodes gene clusters responsible for production of both compounds. the chromosomal region responsible for pyochelin has 98 % sequence identity to pao <dig>  <cit> . the pahm <dig> genome contains a type  <dig> pyoverdine cluster that is 99 % identical to the cluster identified in serotype o <dig> strain p. aeruginosa atcc o <dig>  <cit> . despite the presence of an intact gene cluster, pyoverdine assays indicated that pahm <dig> produces minimal pyoverdine . the gene encoding sigma factor for pyoverdine expression, pvds, has a nonsense mutation in pahm <dig> and is likely the reason for the lack of pyoverdine production. while pyoverdine has been shown to be necessary for acute infections  <cit> , gene expression data and sputum analysis from chronic cf infections have indicated that some strains lose the capacity to produce it  <cit> . assays for pyocyanin in overnight cultures of pahm <dig> indicated a loss of pyocyanin production compared to pao <dig> .

microarray analysis provides a global view of adaptation of pahm <dig> to chronic lung infection
given the wide array of phenotypic changes seen in pahm <dig>  we compared the transcriptome of this strain to pao <dig> when grown in standard laboratory conditions. a total of  <dig> genes were found to be significantly up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated in pahm <dig> compared to pao <dig>  with an overview of affected pathways in fig. 10a, a detailed list of gene expression changes in additional file 5: table s <dig>  and a heat map depicting the significantly regulated genes . recognizing that genomic differences between pahm <dig> and pao <dig> could confound our results, we assessed the coding sequence identity of all genes identified as highly differentially regulated between these strains. of the down-regulated genes detected from the array data,  <dig>  % were absent from the pahm <dig> genome while, as anticipated, 100 % of up-regulated genes were encoded by pahm <dig>  together, these results suggest that the genetic differences between pahm <dig> and pao <dig> had minimal impact on the array results.fig.  <dig> functional analysis of differential gene expression. a functional classification of the genes showing a differential expression in microarray analysis and based on pseudocap function class assignments  <cit> . the proportion of genes over-expressed in pahm <dig> compared to pao <dig> is indicated in green and the proportion of the genes down-regulated compared to pao <dig> appears in red. hypothetical, unclassified and unknown protein and non-coding rna sequences were excluded from the analysis. b adapted intermediary metabolism of pahm <dig> to the bronchiectasis lung. transcripts that were found to be significantly increased  or decreased  in pahm <dig> compared to pao <dig> are indicated in the pathway for central metabolism based on kegg pathways  <cit> .



strikingly, many of the down‐regulated genes in pahm <dig> are involved in virulence phenotypes, such as secreted factors, motility and attachment. this phenomenon is often observed in strains isolated from chronic lung infections in patients with cf  <cit> . with regards to pahm <dig>  down-regulation of virulence-related genes is likely either the result of negative selective pressure in the lung environment of patients with bronchiectasis and/or a consequence of the previously described gene loss in pahm <dig> 

in contrast, a significant number of the p. aeruginosa genes involved in metabolism  and transport  were up‐regulated in pahm <dig> compared to pao <dig>  possibly the result of selective pressure in the bronchiectasis lung.

the differences observed in the transcriptome of pahm <dig> and pao <dig> indicate that metabolism in this isolate is characterized by an increased turnover of amino acids . pahm <dig> had increased levels of transcripts encoding branched amino-acid transporters  and degradation enzymes  compared to pao <dig> 

transcript levels of the glycine betaine uptake system  and degradation pathway through the over expression of gbdr, responsible for controlling the expression of gbcab, dgcab, and soxabdg  <cit>  were increased in pahm <dig> compared to pao <dig>  genes responsible for lipoprotein uptake  and degradation  are also increased, along with pyruvate biosynthesis from serine and degradation of glycine and lactate. these data suggest that the metabolism of pahm <dig> is adapted to preferentially use amino-acids and lipids, abundantly found in the lung secretions of patients with chronic lung infections  <cit> , as sources of carbon, nitrogen and energy.

transcriptome data indicate that the iron acquisition genes pa <dig>  pa <dig>  lipa, liph, and pa <dig>  and zinc acquisition genes np <dig> and znubc  <cit>  are up-regulated in pahm <dig> compared to pao <dig>  previous studies examining gene expression from p. aeruginosa clinical isolates in sputum compared to lab growth medium indicate that while pa <dig> and pa <dig> tended to be up-regulated, lipa, liph and pa <dig> were down-regulated  <cit> . the three zinc acquisition genes up-regulated in the current study were also up-regulated in cf sputum compared to lb in the study by bielecki et al. .

metabolic adaptation of pahm <dig> to the lung of a chronically infected bronchiectasis patient appears to differ from what has been observed in previously characterized cf isolates, which have been shown to have an increased arginine catabolism, up-regulation of branched amino-acids synthesis, unchanged levels of transcripts of enzymes involved in central metabolism and up-regulation of transcripts of enzymes involved in the tca cycle  <cit> . these adaptations were not observed in pahm <dig> 

defects in twitching and swarming motility described above may be a result of down-regulation of the rhamnolipid biosynthetic machinery  , presumably due to a result of the loss of qs in this strain. transcriptome analysis also indicated a decrease in expression of other motility-related genes in pahm <dig> compared to pao <dig> including chemotaxis , tfpa pilin , tfpb pilin, and flagellar biosynthesis machinery . rhamnolipid assays demonstrated a lack of rhamnolipid production by pahm <dig> . similar results have been reported in hypermutator cf isolates  <cit> .

metabolic modeling connects transcriptome analysis, genome sequence, and observed phenotypes
to understand the specific metabolic adaptations in the context of global metabolic function in pahm <dig>  transcriptome data was contextualized using a previously published genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of p. aeruginosa, imo <dig>  <cit> . accounting for the inter-dependent, metabolic functions of  <dig> genes, this computational model can predict metabolic phenotypes relevant to chronic infection of the lung during steady state growth using flux balance analysis. flux balance analysis  is used to predict the ability to grow by calculating the flux that is possible through an objective reaction  in a given environmental condition. this analytical method can also be used to predict the capacity for production of an array of virulence factors, connecting substrates to all intermediate pathways necessary for synthesis of the factors.

computational predictions are improved with the integration of high-throughput profiling data such as gene expression into the model which captures the collection of genes that are active in a given condition  <cit> . subsets of the differentially expressed genes identified in the transcriptome analysis were used to develop genome-scale metabolic models of pao <dig> and pahm <dig> using imo <dig>  a total of  <dig> genes down-regulated in pahm <dig> and  <dig> genes down-regulated in pao <dig>  as identified by the rankprod differential expression analysis, were accounted for in imo <dig>  the models were constrained using gimme, with an expression value cutoff to separate likely active and inactive genes. these analyses identified  <dig> likely inactive genes to incorporate into the conditional metabolic state of pahm <dig> and  <dig> likely inactive genes to incorporate into the pao <dig> metabolic state.

after applying these metabolic states to imo <dig> and performing fba, several of the genes implemented as inactive in one or both models appeared necessary for growth. for example, though glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  is significantly down-regulated in pahm <dig> as indicated in fig. 10b, inactivating this enzyme prevented in silico growth in rich media conditions. this prediction of the apparent essentiality of pa <dig> suggests that while glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is expressed at low levels it is sufficient to enable growth and/or pahm <dig> is expressing an alternate gene that enables glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. a search for potential alternate genes identified a probable glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  that shows a small increase in expression in pahm <dig> compared to pao <dig>  additionally, erythrose 4-phosphate dehydrogenase  is highly up-regulated in pahm <dig> and may also be capable of low levels of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, as has been shown for the e. coli homolog  <cit> . including the catalytic activity of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the model restored in silico growth, demonstrating the potential ability of these two genes to compensate for the function of down-regulated pa <dig> in pahm <dig>  overall, the inactive genes that we reverted to active status in the metabolic states were few  and some are likely artifacts of the conversion from relatively high and low gene expression values to binary on-off states. additionally, imo <dig> is a large, well curated model, but it contains network gaps and incomplete implementation of the relationships between genes, proteins, and reactions that reflect the still-evolving genome annotation and understanding of p. aeruginosa metabolism for both strains studied here.

using expression data to constrain imo <dig> into modpahm <dig> and modpao <dig> growing in rich media in silico enables the comparison of the conditional metabolic states of these strains. essentiality of the active genes in each state was analyzed by preventing the function of the remaining genes one at a time and optimizing for growth. failure to achieve biomass flux indicated that the deleted gene was essential to the model’s growth in that state. this analysis showed that an almost identical set of genes was essential to in silico growth of modpao <dig> and modpahm <dig> on rich media . as the number of genes classified as essential is nearly identical between strains, it confirms that important central metabolic functions are enabled in both strains though their levels of activity may not be comparable, as is suggested by the gapa example discussed above. p. aeruginosa can utilize a wide variety of carbon sources; growth can be achieved through many different catabolic pathways in rich media despite an array of inactive genes. however, functional metabolic changes induced by the gene expression integration are apparent in more peripheral pathways related to virulence factor production and amino acid utilization.

the models enable the comparison of the maximum theoretical production capacity of an array of virulence factors of pahm <dig> and pao <dig>  for each virulence factor capacity prediction, the objective function was changed to a reaction enabling the maximal production of the virulence factor of interest  <cit> . fig. 11a shows that modpahm <dig> has notably higher production capacity for the polysaccharide alginate and phenazine pyocyanin than modpao <dig>  while our previously described assays demonstrated a comparative lack of pyocyanin production in pahm <dig>  false positives for this trait were previously observed with an earlier version of the model and are hypothesized to be the result of regulatory changes within the bacterium that the model does not account for  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression-constrained metabolic modeling. a in silico model predictions of the potential capacity of pao <dig> and pahm <dig> to produce various virulence factors of interest when grown in rich medium. capacity units correlate to the maximum flux through an objective reaction representing the production of each factor normalized by the max uptake flux through the limited carbon uptake reactions for the optimization. b in silico estimation of biomass yield during growth in minimal media conditions supplemented with a single carbon source . presented values are flux through the optimized biomass function normalized by flux through the single carbon source uptake reaction



contrastingly, modpao <dig> has higher production capacity for qs molecules. lps o-antigen production capacities remain similar for each strain, though further investigation of o-antigen genes as explained in a previous section suggests that a frame shift mutation is preventing o-antigen synthesis in pahm <dig> 

the models were then used to predict the utilization of carbon sources commonly present in the lung, such as amino acids. the in silico media was altered to only provide the models with a single carbon source in addition to the standard required salts and ions. fig. 11b shows the difference in biomass yield on the carbon sources surveyed. it is important to note that the apparent inability of pao <dig> to grow on certain substrates reflects our model implementation of down-regulated  genes from in vitro expression data as in silico inactivated genes, and pao <dig> could catabolize many of the substrates given time to adapt its conditional expression profile in appropriate media. the integration of pahm <dig> expression data shows that pahm <dig> is currently better adapted to growth in the lung environment on a systemic level; modpahm <dig> has a clear advantage over modpao <dig> in its ability to catabolize amino acids as energy sources, particularly in the utilization of branched-chain amino acids. modpahm <dig> also shows higher capacity for phenylalanine degradation, and the utilization of l-lactate, both identified as important carbon sources in a study of cystic fibrosis lung sputum  <cit> .

thus, the expression-integrated comparative modeling predicts that pahm <dig> has adapted to its available nutritional resources in the lung environment in addition to altering its virulence factor production profile. the model not only reflects the predisposition of pahm <dig> towards amino acid catabolism, it evaluates all other pathways necessary for growth on amino acids and confirms on a genomic scale the heightened capacity for growth using these substrates. additionally, the model quantifies the high capacity of pahm <dig> for alginate and pyocyanin production while other virulence factor production capacities are lowered, expanding on a more functional level the insights provided by the transcriptome analysis and indicating important phenotypic changes relevant to virulence.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have presented the analysis of the phenotypic characteristics, genome, transcriptome, and metabolic model of a p. aeruginosa non-cf bronchiectasis isolate, showing that p. aeruginosa undergoes a similar process of adaptation in the lung of these patients compared to the lung of cf patients. however, we also identified a collection of genetic and phenotypic traits particular to this strain suggesting niche-specific differences and selection that occur in bronchiectasis. this distinction was typified by the in vitro infection phenotypes which differed from wound and burn isolates  as well as from acute and chronic cf isolates.

the results obtained in this study have advanced our understanding of p. aeruginosa virulence in the context of chronic bronchiectasis infections. however as pahm <dig> is currently the only sequenced p. aeruginosa isolate from chronic bronchiectasis, evaluation of additional isolates would be useful for determining if the characteristics observed in pahm <dig> are common to bronchiectasis isolates or strain specific. this additional characterization in turn will be vital to study the epidemiology and control of chronic infections in patients with bronchiectasis, and provide valuable insights for the identification of prospective therapeutic targets and intervention strategies.
