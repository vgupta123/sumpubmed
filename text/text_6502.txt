BACKGROUND
uncoupling protein  <dig>  is a mitochondrial protein carrier which, until recently, was thought to be found only in endothermic placental  mammals  <cit> . in eutherians, ucp <dig> is the only gene known to be exclusively expressed in brown adipose tissue , accounting for up to 5% of the total mitochondrial protein in bat  <cit> ; ucp <dig>  provides eutherians, particularly small mammals, hibernators and newborns, with a unique mechanism of non-shivering thermogenesis   <cit> . ucp1-dependent nst is probably a feature of most eutherian mammals, as it has been found recently in the rock elephant shrew, a member of the afrotherian mammalian lineage which separated early during the evolution of the eutherians  <cit> . nst is produced by increasing the proton conductance in the inner membrane of brown adipocyte mitochondria. this increased proton conductance uncouples mitochondrial respiration from atp synthesis and thereby dissipates the proton motive force as heat  <cit> . it is the high oxidative capacity of mitochondria in bat and the cellular composition of bat that allows heat dissipation rates at a power of  <dig> –  <dig> w/kg  <cit> . it is these properties of bat, their mitochondria, and the uncoupling activity of ucp <dig> which provide eutherians with nst.

ucp <dig> is a member of the ucp gene family of mitochondrial transport proteins, which contains two closely related paralogs, ucp <dig> and ucp <dig>  although ucp2/ <dig> have been intensively investigated, the molecule that these proteins transport and their overall function remain unclear  <cit> . it is clear that ucp <dig> in fish and mammals are orthologs, forming a monophyletic clade, and that the tissue specificity of ucp <dig> differs between fish, where it is expressed in liver, kidneys and brain, and mammals, where it is expressed exclusively in adipose tissue  <cit> . although the function of ucp <dig> in fish is uncertain, it has been shown that ucp1-like uncoupling activity in fish liver mitochondria is mediated by fatty acids and that it is inhibited by purine nucleotides, analogous to its mediation in eutherians  <cit> . interestingly, while ucp <dig> expression is increased in response to cold in eutherians, it is down regulated in the liver of fish in response to cold  <cit> .

in this study we investigate how the evolution of ucp <dig> may have been influenced by the acquisition of bat-limited expression and the novel role of nst in eutherians. previous work has demonstrated an elevated rate of evolution, i.e. substitution rate, on the ucp <dig> eutherian lineage  <cit> . yet, what remains uncertain is the mode of evolution which acted upon this lineage. identification of lineage-specific directional selection would indeed be suggestive of the acquisition of a new function by ucp <dig>  in contrast, the lack of support for lineage-specific directional selection would not rule out this possibility, but may be more suggestive of eutherian and non-eutherian ucp <dig> functional similarities and thus an evolution of nst through neutral processes. we implement a series of phylogenetic models by maximum likelihood to estimate selection pressures at non-synonymous or replacement sites and at synonymous sites  <cit> . contrasting the rate of evolution at these two sites  provides a means of evaluating the selection pressures which have acted on the protein during the evolution of ucp <dig>  our goal is to determine the mode of selection occurring on the eutherian lineage, where novel biochemical function may have evolved in the course of ucp <dig> becoming a protein obligated to bat-limited expression and nst.

RESULTS
available ucp <dig>  ucp <dig>  and ucp <dig> sequences were retrieved from  <dig> species ranging from teleost fishes to mammals . nucleotide and protein distance nj trees, the species tree and a maximum likelihood  tree were generated for the ucp <dig> locus. no one tree was significantly better than any other as indicated by the rell method  <cit>  and s-h test  <cit> . to evaluate the robustness of the results we chose to run all analyses with both the species tree  and the ml tree. as the results were largely concordant between trees and codon substitution models , the results using the species tree and the f3x <dig> codon substitution model are presented in the main text, unless specified otherwise. all analyses for the ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> loci used the species tree. furthermore, all analyses critical for our conclusions were repeated using the alignments from a second alignment software package, namely t-coffee. again, this was performed to insure the robustness of our results, as different methods may produce different alignments that then influence the outcome of all subsequent analyses. all results were highly congurent between the two alignment methods; we therefore present parameter estimations derived from alignments using muscle, and present only those derived from t-coffee which would lead to different conclusions.

the objective here is to determine the mode of selection that has acted on the ucp <dig> coding sequence in eutherians, where it is certain that ucp <dig> is involved in the dissipation of heat essential for non-shivering thermogenesis. we tested for directional selection on the eutherian branch , and for divergent selection pressure between the eutherian ucp <dig> clade and its paralogs ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> . this was done by comparing the ω value among lineages and among sites across the ucp <dig> phylogeny, in order to determine the mode of selection and the magnitude of change in selective constraint  acting across the ucp <dig> protein as well as within particular functional domains of ucp <dig> 

branch and site ω rate variation
the one-ratio model , which constrains ω to be equal across all lineages of the phylogeny, was used to evaluate the global ω value across the ucp <dig> phylogeny. the ucp <dig> species phylogeny  was used in this analysis. global ω was estimated to be  <dig> , indicative of strong purifying selection. omega estimates for ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> phylogenies, also using species trees appropriate for the ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> data, were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. allowing ω to vary among branches across the ucp <dig> phylogeny  results in a significantly improved fit to the data , 2Δℓ =  <dig>  p <  <dig> , df = 44). thus, there is lineage-specific heterogeneity in ω across the ucp <dig> phylogeny.

along with lineage heterogeneity, variation in ω across sites can also occur. theoretically, different protein domains with different functions may experience different selection pressures, which can be tested by fitting the data to a model comprising different site classes. the m <dig> model partitions the sites among three site categories, based on a discrete distribution. each site category has an estimated proportion  and their ω values  are estimated from the data. this model results in a significantly better fit to the data than the null m <dig> model . this observation is also true for the ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> loci . the ω estimates vary among sites for each gene; however, in general the fraction of sites with low ω estimates, indicative of strong selective constraints, is reduced for ucp <dig> relative to ucp <dig> and ucp <dig>  only 46% of ucp <dig> sites are under strong purifying selection , compared to 60–61% for ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> . this is consistent with the previous observation that the m <dig> ω estimate is higher for ucp <dig>  than for ucp <dig>  or ucp <dig> .

p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> are the estimated proportion of sites, and ω <dig>  ω <dig>  and ω <dig> are the estimated ω values, for site class  <dig> , site class  <dig> , and site class  <dig> , respectively.

relaxed constraint on the eutherian lineage
to determine if the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage  has evolved at a different rate, as compared to the rest of the phylogeny, a two ratio model  was implemented. in this model there are two branch categories, and thus two independent estimates of ω: category  <dig>  for the background branches, i.e. all lineages in the phylogeny excluding the eutherian lineage; and category  <dig> for the foreground branch, i.e. the eutherian lineage. in this model the estimated ω <dig> is  <dig>  for the eutherian branch, and  <dig>  for the background branches. a lr test indicates that the m <dig> model provides a significantly better fit to the data that the m <dig> model . thus, there is a significantly higher ω value for ucp <dig> on the eutherian lineage relative to the rest of the phylogeny. however, this estimate is not indicative of positive selection, it is rather indicative of relaxed constraint. by contrast, the ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> ω estimates for the eutherian lineage do not differ from the rest of the phylogeny, as the lr tests do no indicate a better fit for the m <dig> model over the m <dig> model for these two genes . this contrast between the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage, vs. the eutherian ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> lineages, is further illustrated by the contrast in branch lengths  in the ucp phylogeny .

in principle, the increased ω estimate on the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage could be the result of either an increase in dn or a decrease in ds. to determine the best explanation for this observation we compared the observed dn and ds values for the eutherian lineage to the distribution of these estimates across the ucp <dig> phylogeny, given the estimates from the m <dig> model. the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage ds is  <dig> , which falls in the 70th percentile of ds values for all lineages in the phylogeny, whereas dn for the eutherian lineage is  <dig> , which is the largest dn value in the ucp <dig> phylogeny. hence, it is dn, rather than ds, that appears responsible for the increased ω estimate on the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage, again indicative of relaxed constraint.

branch-sites model
branch models have little power to detect directional selection which has acted on just a few codon sites across a lineage, as any signature of selection would be lost in the abundance of negative selection acting across the remaining codons. for this reason, a branch-sites method has been developed that allows variation in ω across individual codons on a specific lineage  <cit> . this model  designates two categories of branches, again foreground and background, where positive selection is modeled only on the foreground branch. further, the model includes four site categories for both foreground and background . class  <dig> sites are sites under purifying selection, where ω <dig> is estimated to be between  <dig> and  <dig>  class  <dig> sites are neutral sites, where ω <dig> is set to  <dig>  site classes 2a and 2b are sites which are modeled to be under purifying selection  or neutral evolution , respectively, on the background branches. on the foreground branch, these sites are under positive selection, where ω <dig> is allowed to be greater than  <dig>  we have implemented the ma  model, designating the eutherian branch of the ucp <dig> phylogeny  as the foreground branch. the results of this analysis are robust across the different codon substitution models and trees. as done for all analyses, the ma model was tested with both the species tree and the ml tree in combination with the f3x <dig>  f <dig> and fmutsel models of codon substitution. the ma model  did not provide a significantly better fit than the null model, where the null model is neutrality , in any of the analyses . thus, these analyses do not provide any evidence for directional selection on the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage.

because it is theoretically possible for novel functions or functional divergence to evolve without positive selection  <cit> , it may remain informative to functionally investigate the sites identified in these analyses. each of the branch-sites models do identify a few robust sites which have greater than a 95% posterior probability of being correctly assigned to site class  <dig>  i.e. those which may have experienced selection, where ω is greater than one , by the bayes empirical bayes  method  <cit> ; these sites are: 13m, 19s, 26l, 73k, 121l, 150i, 167t, 221v, 256m. it must be emphasized that this analysis is only considered to be informative when the null model of neutrality is rejected and a model of selection provides a better fit to the data. thus, there is no support for these sites to have been the subject of selection; yet these sites could prove to be informative for future studies on ucp <dig> function.

reduction of ucp <dig> evolution in eutherians
to further investigate the possibility of selection we tested for a relative reduction in dn across the eutherian ucp <dig> phylogeny. following the acquisition of a new function by a protein via positive selection at replacement sites, it is predicted that protein evolution should slow down and be dominated by purifying selection  <cit> . to determine if there was a reduction in the rate of non-synonymous substitutions across the ucp <dig> phylogeny, after the demonstrated relative increase of dn on the eutherian lineage, we used the ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> phylogenies as comparative loci. in the branch  and branch-sites  analysis neither ucp <dig> nor ucp <dig> exhibit evidence for either directional selection or relaxed constraints on the eutherian branch. the evolutionary history of ucp <dig> is unique in this respect. thus we assumed that the estimated evolutionary constraints across the eutherian phylogenies of the ucp <dig> paralogs are a good proxy for what may be expected across the ucp <dig> phylogeny. estimated dn values, from the m <dig> analysis, for all congruent branches on the ucp <dig>  ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> phylogenies were used to perform a one-sided paired wilcoxon test. if the eutherian branch had experienced selection at replacement sites we would predict that dn across eutherians in the ucp <dig> phylogeny should, at the very least, not be greater than that observed in its paralogs. contrary to this prediction we find that the rate of substitution at replacement sites remains greater  than that observed across the ucp <dig>  and ucp <dig>  phylogenies. we also found that the rate of replacement substitutions across the ucp <dig> phylogeny is greater than that estimated in the ucp <dig> phylogeny . therefore, congruent lineages across ucp phylogenies do differ from each other in the rate of dn, yet the ucp <dig> phylogeny has the largest dn rate. there is thus no evidence that ucp <dig> evolution has slowed in eutherians, relative to ucp <dig> or ucp <dig>  as may be expected following a selective event for novel function. thus these observations refute a conclusion of directional selection and support a model of relaxed constraint on the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage.

selection for ucp <dig> on the therian lineage
recently, it was discovered that a single marsupial species, the fat-tailed dunnart , also contains bat which is recruited in response to cold acclimatization, and that ucp <dig> expression increases two-fold under cold conditions  <cit> . furthermore, the metabolic rate of this species increased in response to norepinephrine treatment  <cit> , consistent with regulation by ucp <dig>  we therefore tested the therian branch  for branch-site directional selection on ucp <dig>  we found robust support across all analyses  for selection acting on a few sites on the therian lineage. in these analyses, 90% of the sites on the therian branch are under strong purifying selection with a ω of  <dig> ,  <dig> % of sites are neutrally evolving, and  <dig> % of sites have an estimated ω of  <dig> . two sites, 79p and 178t, were identified with >75% probability by the beb method of having been the target of directional selection. while it currently remains unknown if ucp <dig> in the fat-tailed dunnart truly has a thermogenic function, these two identified sites may prove informative in further studies of ucp <dig> function.

functional divergence of ucp1
directional selection is not a necessary requirement for functional divergence to occur in the evolution of gene families, as a new function for a gene can arise through neutral processes via genetic co-option  <cit> . to address this possibility of divergent evolution of ucp <dig> and its paralogs via neutral processes, we used the mc model  <cit> , which allows for divergent selection pressures at one site class between different clades of a phylogeny or between paralogs. a prediction of this model is that one gene, in a gene family, can experience reduced functional constraint, via genetic redundancy, allowing the accumulation of mutations that will alter protein function, particularly at a time when the environment changes. first, the m <dig> model was used to obtain the global constrained estimate of ω of  <dig>  for the entire ucp phylogeny . we then ran the m <dig> branch model using each ucp eutherian lineage as the foreground branch. the ω estimate for the ucp <dig> eutherian branch was  <dig> , and was a significantly better fit to the data than the m <dig> model , as was found previously when only the ucp <dig> phylogeny was analyzed . for the ucp <dig> locus, the ω estimate for the eutherian lineage was  <dig> , which is significantly smaller than the global ω estimate . the ω estimate for the ucp <dig> eutherian lineage was  <dig> , which is not significantly different from the global ω estimate . thus, ucp <dig>  exhibits a significantly higher ω value on the eutherian lineage in the context of the entire ucp phylogeny, consistent with our previous observations and relaxed functional constraint.

we then fit our data to the mc model with five different clades, a-e, set as the foreground branches . the mc model  has five parameters  estimated. there are three site classes; site class  <dig> are defined sites of purifying selection where ω <dig> is estimated to be between  <dig> and  <dig> , site class  <dig> are neutral sites with ω <dig> set equal to  <dig> , and site class  <dig> is the divergent site class where there is an independent estimate of ω for the background  and foreground  branches . the lr test for each of these analyses is the comparison of the mc model to the m1a sites model, in which there are two site classes across the entire ucp phylogeny . the m1a model estimates that 90% of the sites are under strong purifying selection with a ω estimate of  <dig> . each mc analysis provided a significantly better fit to the data than the m1a model . the parameter estimates  are very similar across analyses, suggesting that the model is indeed robust to altering foreground and background branches. to summarize, overall about 60% of the sites in the ucp phylogeny are under strong purifying selection, about 1% of the sites are evolving neutrally, and about 39% of the sites are under divergent selection pressures between ucp <dig> and its paralogs. the results for clades b, c, and d  suggest that there has been more purifying selection across the ucp <dig> phylogeny than that of the ucp <dig> 

p <dig> is the estimated proportion of sites in site class  <dig> , ω <dig> is the estimated ω value for site class 0; p <dig> is the estimated proportion of sites in site class  <dig> , background ω  is the estimated ω value for divergent sites on the background branches; foreground ω  is the estimated ω value for divergent sites on the foreground branches; 2Δℓ is the lr test statistic for comparing the mc and m1a models; p is the p-value of the lr test.

the model with the highest log likelihood is with the eutherian ucp <dig> clade  set as the foreground branch. similar results are obtained when the entire ucp <dig> clade  is set as the foreground branch. however, the log likelihood is lower and the ω <dig> estimate for the foreground divergent class is larger when only considering the eutherian ucp <dig> clade . the ω <dig> observed  for the entire ucp <dig> clade  may largely reflect the divergent selection pressures in the eutherian clade , with the marsupial and fish lineages reducing the ω <dig> estimate for the foreground branch in the entire ucp <dig> phylogeny . furthermore, it is the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage itself that is driving the functional divergence of the eutherian ucp <dig> clade. repeating the mc model but setting the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage   as the foreground branch, an ω of  <dig>  is estimated for divergent sites, while background lineages have an ω of  <dig> , where p <dig> =  <dig>  ). in conclusion, these analyses indicate that the ucp <dig> phylogeny exhibits large divergent selection pressures, which may principally involve the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage, consistent with the possible acquisition of the new function of ucp <dig> through neutrally evolving, relaxed constraints.

the beb method is implemented in each analysis to determine the probability  <cit>  of each site belonging to site class  <dig> , site class  <dig> , or site class  <dig> . site classifications are consistent across each analysis. figure  <dig> is a plot of site class probability, i.e. the probability of each codon belonging to one of the three site categories, namely purifying, neutral or divergent. approximately 40% of all sites are under divergent selection pressure, with nonsynonymous substitutions accumulating at a rate ~ <dig> × greater in the ucp <dig> eutherian clade  relative to its paralogs, as compared to synonymous substitutions. sites categorizations are nearly identical when the mc model is run with either the eutherian ucp <dig> clade or the eutherian ucp <dig> lineage set as the foreground branch . it is only the ω estimations that are largely different for the divergent class between the two analyses . in contrast to the eutherian clade analysis, the eutherian lineage analysis has a nonsynonymous substitution rate that is ~5× greater than that of all other lineages in the entire phylogeny. divergent sites are found across the entire protein and in all functional domains, assigned by their topology to regions located in the intermembrane, transmembrane, and matrix space. notably, the protein regions exposed to the intermembrane space are significantly over-represented with divergent sites . this result suggests that functional constraints are more relaxed for the regions of the protein exposed to the intermembrane space in eutherians. this may have enabled the recruitment of novel interactions with proteins which potentially regulate the activity of ucp <dig> 

positive selection following duplication
in addition to any selection on ucp <dig> for nst in eutherians, there may have been positive selection on other sites in any of the ucp loci following the gene duplications that created them. we therefore used the ucp phylogeny  and the branch-sites model  to test lineages a , b , c , and d  for positive selection acting on only a few sites. again, lr tests were used to compare the ma model to the ma <dig> model, in which the ω estimate for site class  <dig> is set to  <dig>  to assess if the ma model with positive selection is significantly better than the ma <dig> model of neutrality. no robust statistical evidence for selection was discovered for any basal ucp lineage. statistical evidence for selection was identified for ucp <dig> , ucp2/ <dig>  and ucp <dig>  when the analysis was carried out using the muscle alignment , but these results were not supported by the t-coffee alignments, and hence any conclusions about positive selection on any of the ucp loci following gene duplication depend on the alignment.

p <dig> and p <dig> are the estimated proportion of sites, and ω <dig> and ω <dig> are the estimated ω values for site class  <dig>  and site class  <dig> , respectively; selected sites are those with a large posterior probability of belonging to the selected site category.

codon usage bias
a recently developed codon substitution model, fmutsel, explicitly models mutational biases and selection at silent codon sites  <cit> . this model was compared to the null model, fmutsel <dig>  which only models mutational biases, and does not include the additional codon fitness parameter in fmutsel which models selection on silent sites. the lrt between these two models has  <dig> degrees of freedom, resulting from the parameter rich fmutsel model . it has been suggested that codon usage bias could have a drastic effect on estimation of dn and ds  <cit> . the species tree for each ucp locus was used in these analyses, not the full ucp phylogeny found in figure  <dig>  we find that each of the ucp loci has statistically significant evidence for selection at silent sites . this result is not surprising, as about 90% of  <dig>  genes tested reject the null model, indicating that selection on silent sites is a common phenomenon across the mammalian genome  <cit> . thus, codon usage bias is widespread and silent sites are not neutrally evolving. this conclusion, however, does not discredit the use of ω  as a means of identifying sites of selection. selection on the protein alters the rate of evolution at replacement sites, and it is this rate of change before and after selection that is contrasted. thus, it does not matter if the rate of substitution at silent sites is driven by mutation or selection  <cit> .

fmutselℓ is the log likelihood of the fmutsel substitution model; fmutsel0ℓ is the log likelihood of the fmutsel <dig> substitution model; 2Δℓ is the lr test statistic for comparing these two models; p is the p-value of the lr test; ω is the estimated ω value for the designated gene phylogeny using the global m <dig> model; p+ is the proportion of advantageous mutations that could occur across the gene; s+ is the selection coefficient for advantageous mutations; s- is the selection coefficient for disadvantageous mutations.

interestingly, even though the fmutsel model was a much better fit to the data than the null model for all three loci, the statistical significance of the difference between the models for the ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> loci are orders of magnitude larger than for the ucp <dig> locus . this may suggest that selection on silent sites has been reduced across the ucp <dig> phylogeny. the proportion of advantageous mutations  estimated in the ucp phylogenies is about  <dig>  –  <dig> , similar to the average estimate of  <dig>  across  <dig>  genes  <cit> . in contrast, the estimated average selection coefficient for advantageous  and disadvantageous  mutations  for each of these ucp loci are greater than three times the average selection coefficient for other genes  <cit> . thus, mutations at silent sites in these three loci would seem to be either highly preferential or highly deleterious, as compared to the genome average.

discussion
it has long been thought that ucp <dig> had evolved in eutherian mammals in conjunction with the evolution of brown adipose tissue. recent discoveries of ucp <dig> orthologs in fish and non-eutherian mammals have now discredited this idea  <cit> , as fish and most non-eutherian mammals do not contain brown adipose tissue where ucp <dig> plays a major role in thermogenesis. furthermore, the recent discovery of ucp <dig> localized in adipose tissue in a marsupial species, where it is also regulated in response to cold acclimatization  <cit>  has forced a reevaluation of the evolution of non-shivering thermogenesis. in particular, when did the biochemical properties of ucp <dig> which confer the capability of thermogenesis evolve?

in this study we have used codon substitution models implemented through a maximum likelihood framework to estimate the rate of evolution at silent and replacement sites in ucp <dig> and its paralogs, ucp <dig> and ucp <dig>  different models were used to investigate variation in the rate of evolution between lineages of a phylogeny, between clades of a phylogeny, and to estimate ω for specific lineages and sites across phylogenies. our objective was to determine the mode of evolution on the ucp <dig> eutherian lineage, to illuminate possible evolutionary consequences of novel functions necessary for nst. we observed a significant, five-fold increase in the rate of ucp <dig> evolution on the eutherian lineage, but found no strong statistical evidence for directional selection. yet, it should be noted that the power of these analyses are dependent on the magnitude of the selection pressure and the proportion of sites affected  <cit> . these models do have underlying assumptions, namely no variation in branch and site ω values. as we have demonstrated, variation among branch and sites is observed in the ucp <dig> phylogeny. while large deviations from these assumptions will affect the power of the analysis, the ma model does seem to be robust to moderate deviation in these assumptions  <cit> . as such, relaxed functional constraint is most consistent with the molecular evolutionary analyses of the ucp data. further, our observation of strong purifying selection being the primary mode of evolution throughout the ucp phylogeny is consistent with the findings of a recent study published while this paper was under review  <cit> .

our conclusion is in contrast to a previous study which implemented a heuristic branch model and concluded that the ucp <dig> eutherian lineage had experienced positive selection on replacement sites  <cit> . that study estimated  <dig>  nonsynonymous and  <dig>  synonymous substitutions on the eutherian branch using a least-squares approach, whereas we estimate  <dig>  nonsynonymous and  <dig>  synonymous substitutions respectively. we repeated the analyses in  <cit> , using their methodology, and obtained essentially the same results they did . to determine why these two methods are giving drastically different results, we simulated the evolutionary history of ucp <dig> using the branch-lengths given by the m <dig> global model, the global ω estimate of  <dig> , and the evolver program in the paml 4a package . we then estimated ω for the eutherian lineage using both the heuristic method  <cit>  and the ml  model used in this study. the resulting ω estimate for the ml model was  <dig> , virtually identical to the value used in the simulations, while the ω estimate for the heuristic approach was  <dig> . we repeated the simulation, setting ω =  <dig>  for the eutherian lineage and ω =  <dig>  for all other lineages, which mirrors the observed data. the resulting ω estimate for the eutherian lineage was  <dig>  based on the ml model and  <dig>  based on the heuristic approach. in each simulation the heuristic approach greatly under-estimated the number of synonymous substitutions. we conclude that the contradiction between our results and the previous study  <cit>  results from the poor performance of the heuristic least-squares method on trees and lineages with long branch lengths. it appears that least-squares method drastically underestimate the number of synonymous substitutions  <cit> .

an alternative to relaxed functional constraint as an explanation for the increased rate of evolution on the ucp <dig> eutherian lineage would be a decrease in the effective population size  of the ancestor of all eutherian mammals. however, a change in ne along the eutherian lineage would affect all loci in the genome. as such the ucp <dig> paralogs, ucp <dig> and ucp <dig>  should also reflect any possible changes in ne. yet these ucp <dig> paralogs do not exhibit a rate increase, so a decrease in ne can be excluded. therefore it remains that the best explanation for the increase in ucp <dig> evolution along the eutherian lineage is relaxation of functional constraints, possibly allowing functional divergence through neutral processes.

assuming that ucp <dig> did indeed experience relaxation of functional constraints on the eutherian lineage, what may have caused this? there are several possible explanations, which are not mutually exclusive. first, it has been documented that the physiological relevance of thermogenic function varies across eutherians, with nst being most efficient in small mammals and hibernators, particularly those which inhabit environments with long cold seasons  <cit> . if the ancestor of all eutherians was a large species where nst was not important, or a species which inhabited a moderate environment, functional constraints on ucp <dig> could have been relaxed. the ancestor of all extant eutherians lived ~150– <dig> mya, during the late jurassic and early cretaceous  <cit> . in general mammals of this period are thought to have been small in size  <cit>  and this era was also generally warmer than today  <cit> . thus it is possible that constraints on ucp <dig> were reduced at some time point prior to the eutherian radiation, some  <dig> mya. second, it could be that some function of ucp <dig> in eutherians was taken over by ucp1's paralogs, which would also reduce the level of constraint. it is certain that ucp <dig> in eutherians must have had a role in some other tissue prior to becoming an obligate bat protein. genes expressed in many tissues tend to be more constrained than those expressed in one or a few tissues  <cit> . thus, the release of ucp <dig> from its role in other tissues would allow ucp <dig> to evolve tissue specificity to bat, decrease the selective constraint on ucp <dig>  and allow for genetic co-option . for example, as shown in table  <dig>  the ω estimate  assigned to site class  <dig>  suggests that there has been more selective constraint on ucp <dig>  which is expressed in many tissues, than on ucp <dig>  which is expressed in just a few tissues  <cit> . the function of ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> are currently uncertain; determining their function would certainly aid in understanding ucp <dig> evolution.

in the process of genetic co-option or functional gene divergence it is not necessary for directional selection to act on protein evolution in order for divergent/novel functions to evolve. constraint on a protein can be relaxed when a paralog is available to fulfill the function of that protein. as such, evolution can then act to use existing gene functions for a new purpose. the prediction of heterogeneity in selection pressures between gene paralogs exemplifies the divergent selection pressures that allow the evolution of divergent functions. we examined the potential of genetic co-option, i.e. functional divergence of ucp <dig>  through the implementation of the mc clade model  <cit> . we found that about 40% of the sites were under divergent selection pressures, with the ucp <dig> clade experiencing a greater number of substitutions at replacement sites relative to silent sites . moreover, intermembrane sites are over-represented in the divergent site category, which may suggest that intermembrane interactions have diverged in eutherian ucp <dig>  regardless, it is apparent that there has been tissue-specific functional divergence of ucp <dig> in bat.

cold-induced ucp <dig> expression was recently detected in adipose tissue of the interscapular region of the australian fat-tailed dunnart , a dasyurid marsupial species  <cit> . further, the adipose tissue in which it was found was described as being an archetypal brown adipose tissue. as such, these findings challenge the view of nst as an exclusive property of eutherians. however, this finding is unique to this particular marsupial, as cold-induced ucp <dig> expression was not found in the dasyurid marsupial antechius flavipes  or the south american didelphid marsupial monodelphis domestica . furthermore, there is currently no evidence for a thermogenic role of ucp <dig> in the fat-tailed dunnart. its regulation and expression is suggestive of a thermogenic role, yet no evidence of non-shivering thermogenesis or "adaptive-nst", i.e. an adaptive organismal response to the cold, has been demonstrated. as such, if nst is determined to be present in the fat-tailed dunnart, it would most likely be a case of parallel evolution or multiple lineage loss of nst, as deduced from phylogenetic inference and given that these findings are restricted to a single non-eutherian species.

nevertheless, since ucp <dig> in the fat-tailed dunnart does show a response to cold and norepinephrine  <cit>  similar to that found in eutherians, it may be that any truly novel function of ucp <dig> started evolving in the therian  lineage. we therefore tested for selection on ucp <dig> on this lineage and found strong evidence for positive selection, and we identified two sites  which may be responsible for any novel ucp <dig> function. these two sites should be the target of further functional investigations. moreover, it is not clear if ucp <dig> in marsupials is truly functionally identical to ucp <dig> in eutherians; more studies are needed to clarify this issue.

CONCLUSIONS
in agreement with previous studies, we find evidence for acceleration in the evolution of ucp <dig> on the eutherian lineage. however, in contrast to previous studies, our analyses indicate that relaxed constraints on ucp <dig>  rather than directional selection, seem to be responsible. we suggest that this relaxation of constraints on ucp <dig> may have allowed the acquisition or enhancement of the  novel role of ucp <dig> in nst in eutherians, as supported by the divergent selection pressures identified in the ucp phylogeny. currently, the most likely hypothesis for the origin of nst hinges upon the evolution of bat with high mitochondrial oxidative capacities. for this requirement to be meet evolution needs a tissue with many mitochondria which in turn have a high expression level of ucp <dig> and complexes i-iv of the electron transport chain. this combination can then induce a high mitochondrial oxidative capacity which will lead to heat production . as such, we hypothesize that ucp <dig> in eutherians and non-eutherians share similar or identical biochemical properties. to test this hypothesis the biochemical properties of ucp <dig> in non-eutherians need to be elucidated.
