BACKGROUND
mps comprise up to 30% of genes in fully sequenced genomes and have critical roles in a variety of biological processes including signal transduction, substrate transport, and energy production  <cit> . however, functional and structural studies of mps are far behind that of soluble proteins. one of the major bottlenecks in the study of mps is the difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of homogeneous protein. for instance, it is typically not easy to purify mps in preparative scale, due to their low abundance in natural sources. overexpression of recombinant mps in living cells is often unsuccessful due to the inhibitory effect of high mp concentration on host cell physiology  <cit> .

recently, cell-free protein synthesis systems have emerged as a promising tool for mp production  <cit> . in addition to decoupling protein production from the toxic or inhibitory effects on host cell physiology, cell-free systems offer a unique advantage in that protein synthesis can be easily modified by addition of accessory elements, such as detergents and lipids. the addition of detergents and lipids to cell-free systems allows the synthesis of mp/detergent and mp/lipid complexes, respectively, and successful synthesis of functional mps in this fashion have been reported recently  <cit> . for example, klammt et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that a g protein-coupled receptor, etb, can be synthesized in a soluble form using an escherichia coli-based cell-free system supplemented with brij <dig>  and that the synthesized proteins have ligand binding activity. the ligand binding activity of a human olfactory receptor, hor17- <dig>  synthesized using a wheat cell-free system in the presence of fc <dig>  has been also reported  <cit> . kalmbach et al.  <cit>  reported that e. coli cell-free synthesized bacteriorhodopsin in the presence of liposomes was active in black lipid membrane mediated photocurrent measurements. goren and fox  <cit>  showed reconstitution of the functional stearoyl co-a desaturase complex, which consists of three proteins, cytochrome b <dig>  cytochrome b <dig> reductase, and human stearoyl-coa desaturase  <dig>  synthesized by wheat cell-free system in the presence of asolectin liposomes. however, the general versatility of this method is unclear as the above examples focus on specific mps.

in a previous study, we reported functional synthesis of a phosphate trranslocator in a wheat cell-free synthesis system supplemented with liposomes and formation of lipid/mp complexes  <cit> . the mechanism for production of functional protein in this method is not clear, but association of synthesized mp with liposomes may be an important step. to better understand this, we tested the timing of liposome addition to the cell-free mp synthesis reaction. we also investigated whether other mps synthesized by the method also associates with liposomes. moreover, we tried to purify the synthesized mp as a lipid/mp complex by dgu.

RESULTS
timing of liposome-supplementation to wheat cell-free translation system for synthesis of functional mps
previously, we reported synthesis and liposome association of functional mps using a wheat cell-free system supplemented with liposomes  <cit> . to verify that co-translational association of mp with liposomes is critical for functional synthesis, we tested the synthesis of an arabidopsis thaliana phosphate translocator, atppt <dig>  in the presence of, absence of, and after post-translational addition of liposomes. these synthesized proteins were reconstituted into liposomes by freeze-thaw and sonication methods after mixing with substrate-preloaded liposomes and phosphate-incorporation activity was measured. similar to a previous report  <cit> , atppt <dig> synthesized in the absence of liposomes had only 4% of the activity of atppt <dig> synthesized in the presence of liposomes . atppt <dig> synthesized in the absence of liposomes was mixed post-translationally with liposomes and yielded 6% the activity of atppt <dig> synthesized in the presence of liposomes. the association of synthesized atppt <dig> with liposomes, either co- or post-translationally, was measured after sucrose dgu and showed no significant differences . these results indicate that formation of lipid/atppt <dig> complex during the synthesis reaction is an important step for synthesizing functional atppt <dig>  supplementation of liposomes into the cell-free system would prevent aggregation and precipitation of atppt <dig> proteins during synthesis reaction. so, the constitution of atppt1/lipid complexes might be effective for formation of functional state mps in the following freeze-thaw and sonication steps. for preparing mps in functional state by cell-free system, preventing aggregation and precipitation of mps during synthesis reaction by supplementation of lipids and/or detergents would be a critical point.

cell-free synthesis of mps in the presence of liposomes
using a wheat cell-free system in the presence of liposomes, a plant mp, atppt <dig>  was synthesized as a lipid/mp complex . as mps account for more than 50% of all human drug targets  <cit> , we wanted to understand if the atppt <dig> membrane association described above was applicable to mammalian mps. in general, mps are classified by the number of tmds and to start we tested five human mps ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> tmd . the selected mammalian mps were synthesized in the wheat cell-free system in the presence of asolectin liposomes and their liposome association rates were measured after sucrose dgu. in this experiment, mrna was prepared from fragments made by split-primer pcr  <cit> . by using a pcr-based fragment as a template for in vitro transcription, time consuming steps, such as cloning of a target gene and construction of an expression vector were eliminated. although the yield of template is low, this step allows for screening large numbers of proteins. as shown in figure  <dig>  every protein in the test set was associated with liposomes. after sucrose dgu, 14c-labeled proteins were predominantly detected in bands six to eight , which corresponded with the observed liposome bands  <cit> . for each fraction, the radioactivity was measured and the relative amount of radioactivity for each fraction is depicted in figure 2b. the extent of association for these proteins ranged from  <dig> to 73%, when three fractions, numbers six to eight, were treated as liposome fractions. the observed mp association is similar to that seen atppt <dig> . also there were no significant differences in the extent of association between the five mps having two to  <dig> tmds. these results suggest that association of synthesized mps with liposomes during wheat cell-free synthesis is as likely to occur in other mps as was observed for atppt <dig> 

next we further analyzed membrane association using a larger set of proteins, which consisted of  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse mps. while a majority of the test proteins were chosen at random, we ensured that there were multiple representatives of each tested mp family to examine synthesis yield and extent of liposome association within a family. as shown in figure 3a, the  <dig> mps tested showed better synthesis efficiency than gfp . the mean value of yield for the set of mps was  <dig>  μg/ <dig> μl reaction. all tested proteins belonging to kcnj, p2rx, gabr and sc5a families were well synthesized in the wheat cell-free system, whereas production of cacng family proteins was very low . the remaining proteins, belonging to endr, p2ry, slc6a and slc22a families had both poorly and well synthesized proteins. .

the extent of association of all  <dig> proteins tested, containing between one and  <dig> tmds, were from  <dig> to 73% and the mean value was 59% . the amount of proteins associated with liposomes was calculated from the yield and extent of association for each protein . the mean value of the association yield was  <dig>  μg/ <dig> μl reaction. when analyzing association by the number of tmds, the lowest extent of association was 43% for  <dig> tmd , whereas the mean value of association for proteins having more than  <dig> tmds was approximately 60% . these results indicate that efficiency of association of proteins having only 1tmd might be lower than that of proteins having more than 2tmd.

in this experiment, we found that a variety of mps make complexes with lipids during wheat cell-free synthesis in the presence of liposomes. it is not yet clear whether these mps are integrated into liposomes or attached to surface of liposomes with their hydrophobic regions. for replying to this question, further experiments for evaluating function and/or structure of each synthesized mp are needed. however, as association of mps with liposomes prevents aggregation and precipitation of synthesized mps during synthesis reaction, formation of lipid/mp complex would be an important step for preparing mps.

katzen et al.  <cit>  recently reported that insertion of emre into a discoidal membrane scaffold in correctly folded state during cell-free synthesis by analysis of binding activity of its substrate, tetraphenylphosphonium. moritani et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that connexin- <dig> synthesized by an e. coli cell-free system, pure system containing minimum protein synthesis factors  <cit> , in the presence of liposomes is directly integrated with a uniform orientation into liposome membrane. the connexin- <dig> synthesized into liposomes was shown to deliver a hydrophilic and bioactive oligo-peptide to cells through gap junctions  <cit> . they speculate that liposomes may have chaperone-like function because their system consists of only protein synthesis factors and liposomes  <cit> . although it is still not clear any kinds of mps can receive such a chaperone-like effect from liposomes, the addition of artificial membranes to cell-free reactions appears to be effective in synthesizing membrane-stabilized mps.

partial purification of synthesized mps by density-gradient ultracentrifugation
in this study, we demonstrated that a variety of mammalian mps are efficiently associated with liposomes during wheat cell-free synthesis supplemented with liposomes. next, we tried to partially purify the synthesized lipid/mp complexes from the endogenous wheat germ proteins. for this experiment we used p2rx <dig> as a model protein, because both the yield  and extent of association  are very close to the mean value for both of these parameters in the full mammalian mp dataset above .

a gfp-p2rx <dig> fusion protein was synthesized using the wheat cell-free system supplemented with liposomes and the resultant lipid/mp complexes were subjected to accudenz dgu. accudenz is a non-toxic medium used for fractionation of proteins, organelles, and cells  <cit> . the wheat cell-free synthesis reaction was brought to 40% accudenz by addition of an 80% accudenz solution, placed at the bottom of an ultra-centrifugation tube, and overlaid with 35% accudenz solution, 30% accudenz solution and dgu solution. it is expected that after accudenz dgu, liposomes float to the top of the centrifuge tube owing to their low density  <cit> . as shown in figure 4a, the fluorescence from gfp-p2rx <dig> fusion proteins was observed at the top of the gradient after accudenz dgu, while the majority of the fluorescence from a soluble gfp control remained at the bottom. after fractionation, the fluorescence of each fraction was measured with a spectrofluorometer . high fluorescence intensity at the top fraction, associated with floated liposomes, was detected in gfp-p2rx <dig> sample synthesized by liposome supplemented wheat cell-free synthesis . in the other samples, gfp synthesized with or without liposomes and gfp-p2rx <dig> synthesized without liposomes, fluorescence was mainly detected in the lower fractions . the extent of association of gfp-p2rx <dig> in this experiment  was similar to the association of p2rx <dig> calculated by sucrose dgu . although we also tested association of p2rx2-gfp with liposomes with same procedure, there were no significant differences in association rate .

although fluorescence was seen at the top of the gradient in the soluble gfp control after accudenz dgu by using a transilluminator  with a filter for removing blue light , the fluorescence in the top fraction was not detected with a spectrofluorometer using a condition for detection of fluorescence from gfp  . these results indicate that the fluorescence in the top fraction is not attributed to gfp but probably to the liposomes. in comparison to sucrose dgu, accudenz dgu makes lipid/mp complex recovery easier due to the fact that liposomes float in accudenz as opposed to sinking as in sucrose. additionally, accudenz is a preferred dgu solution because it is non-toxic.

the gfp-fusion p2rx <dig> is an ideal construct to determine the optimal conditions for accudenz dgu as the liposome-associated protein can be readily monitored by fluorescence. we tested several centrifugation times for accudenz dgu. as shown in figure 4c, the fluorescence in the top fraction gradually increased in proportion centrifugation time. one-h centrifugation appears to be sufficient for lipid/mp complex floatation. the results from accudenz dgu of two additional mps, gfp-p2rx <dig> and gfp-slc6a <dig>  also showed that the floatation rates of lipid/mp complex plateaus at a one-h centrifugation .

as shown in figure 4b, gfp and gfp-p2rx <dig> could be clearly separated by dgu. the result suggests that lipid/mp complexes can be separated from endogenous proteins derived from the wheat germ extract by accudenz dgu. nomura et al. also reported that cytochrome b <dig> synthesized by the wheat cell-free system in the presence of liposomes was easily purified by simplified discontinuous dgu  <cit> . in addition, goren and fox showed that a mp, hscd <dig>  synthesized by the wheat cell-free system supplemented with liposomes could be separated from endogenous wheat germ proteins by accudenz dgu  <cit> . we next tried to purify p2rx <dig>  without a gfp fusion, by this method. after synthesis supplemented with liposomes, lipid/mp complexes were concentrated by centrifugation and applied to accudenz dgu. after ultracentrifugation, the top fraction was recovered and applied to sds-page. as shown in figure 4e, p2rx <dig> was detected as a major band by cbb-staining after sds-page. this result indicates that lipid/mp complexes synthesized by our wheat cell-free system supplemented with liposomes can be partially purified by accudenz dgu. to test whether proteins purified by this method are functional, we tested the activity of atppt <dig> partially purified as lipid/mp complexes. we detected transport activity of atppt <dig> purified with accudenz dgu . in addition to functional analysis, this partially purified protein could be used for structural analysis. however, some contaminating proteins from wheat germ extracts do float with the lipid/mp complexes. goren and fox  <cit>  reported that, along with other unclassified contaminants, hsp <dig>  elongation factor  <dig> α and  <dig>  kda heat shock protein were seen in wheat cell-free synthesized and floated lipid/mp complexes. for functional and structural analysis, further purification steps would be required including affinity-tag purification and gel-filtration.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a production method for lipid/mp complexes using a wheat germ cell-free system supplemented with liposomes. using this method, a variety of mammalian mps were efficiently associated with liposomes co-translationally. the resultant lipid/mp complexes are easily separated from other proteins in wheat germ extract by dgu. this synthesis method is useful in the preparation of mp for structural and functional analysis.
