BACKGROUND
fusarium verticillioides , which is present in most maize fields, can be an asymptomatic endophyte or the causal agent of seedling, stalk, ear, and kernel diseases  <cit> . the pathogen produces fumonisins, a group of structurally related polyketide mycotoxins, during colonization of maize kernels. ingestion of fumonisin b <dig> , the most predominant fumonisin analog, can result in leukoencephalomalacia in horses and pulmonary edema in swine. the mycotoxin also has been implicated in human diseases, including cancer and birth defects  <cit> . guidelines for maximum fumonisin levels in human food and animal feeds have been established worldwide  <cit> . furthermore, economic losses associated with fumonisin contamination in maize exports by the three major maize-exporting nations  were estimated at $ <dig> million annually  <cit>  with the us losses alone at nearly $ <dig> million annually  <cit> .

recent publications describe the complexity of genes that influence regulation of fumonisin biosynthesis. pathway-specific activator fum <dig> , which controls transcription of the cluster of fum genes  <cit> , was shown to increase when f. verticillioides was treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor chostatin a  <cit> . these results support evidence that histone modification plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of fumonisin production  <cit> . there are several intriguing reports indicating that environmental conditions  also affect the transcription of fum genes and fb <dig> production. expression of the nitrogen utilization gene area  was found to be responsible for repression of fb <dig> production by ammonium  <cit> . under repression conditions, area is hypothesized to bind to gata sequences in the promoters of the fum genes. generally, acidic conditions favor fb <dig> production  <cit> . experimental evidence indicates that pacc , which has homology to the alkaline-activator gene pacc in a. nidulans  <cit> , inhibits fb <dig> production and fum <dig>  transcription at ph  <dig>  <cit> . finally, carbon source and availability, especially amylopectin, greatly affect fb <dig> biosynthesis  <cit> . studies on carbon utilization have led to the identification of two genes, hxk <dig>  and fst <dig> . hxk <dig>  a putative hexose kinase was shown to be required for fructose metabolism  <cit> . strains without a functional hxk <dig> also produced less fb <dig> and were less virulent on maize kernel than the wild type . the function of fst <dig> is the focus of the current study.

fst <dig> was identified through a comparative analysis of genes expressed in colonized maize germ and endosperm tissues  <cit> . of  <dig> putative sugar transporter genes represented on a microarray, fst <dig> was one of six genes identified as highly expressed during fungal growth in endosperm tissue compared to germ tissue  <cit> . expression of fst <dig> was also reduced in a f. verticillioides strain with a disrupted zfr <dig> gene, a putative zn2cys <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . fst <dig> encodes a 574-amino-acid protein with  <dig> putative transmembrane domains. heterologous expression of fst <dig> in yeast system failed to show hexose transporter activity  <cit> . disruption of fst <dig> in f. verticillioides resulted in reduced virulence and fb <dig> production  <cit> . the reduced virulence phenotype in inoculated kernels was manifested as slower growth and rot symptoms when compared to the wt  <cit> . when inoculated onto autoclaved kernels or synthetic media, mutant growth was the same as wt  <cit> . in contrast, the mutant failed to produce fb <dig> on either living or dead kernels.

in the current study, we describe three new phenotypes attributed to a non-functional fst <dig>  furthermore, we describe the effects of fst <dig> on whole genome expression by comparing the transcriptomes of the wt and ∆fst <dig> strains of f. verticillioides grown on autoclaved maize kernels. the results support our hypothesis that fst <dig> has a regulatory function that globally impacts gene expression.

RESULTS
macroconidia production and sensitivity to h2o2
wild type f. verticillioides produces primarily microconidia and very few macroconidia. when grown on carnation leaf agar  medium, higher numbers of macroconidia are produced on the leaves. we found that strain ∆fst <dig> produced only 10% as many macroconidia as the wt . in the complemented strain fst1-comp, macroconidia production approached wt levels . there were no measurable differences between ∆fst <dig> and wt in the production or morphology of microconidia, conidiophores, or microconidal chains.table  <dig>

to determine if the reduced growth phenotype of ∆fst <dig> mutants grown on living kernels was associated with increased sensitivity to reactive oxygen species, we evaluated growth of ∆fst <dig> mutants on agar plates amended with hydrogen peroxide. Δfst <dig> was found to be more sensitive than wt, and the differences were most pronounced at 15% h2o <dig>  . the zone of the inhibition for strain Δfst <dig> was  <dig>  and  <dig>  times larger than that of the wt and strain fst1-comp, respectively.figure  <dig> resistance to hydrogen peroxide assay. conidia of wild type, ∆fst <dig>  and fst1-comp were suspended into molten pda medium. after 24 hours, 15% hydrogen peroxide solution was added to a well cut into each culture. photograph was taken after two days of incubation. each plate is labeled with the mean area of inhibition  for three replicates. the standard errors were  <dig>  cm <dig> or less.



analysis of transcriptome
rna isolated from four biological replicates of Δfst <dig> and wt were sequenced, which resulted in a total of over  <dig> million reads . approximately  <dig> million  of the total reads uniquely mapped to the reference genome of f. verticillioides. results from the mapping indicated that of the  <dig>  annotated genes of f. verticillioides,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were expressed  in Δfst <dig> and wt, respectively. to identify differentially expressed genes, a pairwise t-test was made between the expression data of wt and strain Δfst <dig>  the expression of  <dig>  genes was found to be significantly different  with an absolute fold difference greater than two. of these,  <dig>   genes were up-regulated in Δfst <dig> and  <dig>   genes were down-regulated. also, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> genes that were uniquely expressed in wt and Δfst <dig>  respectively. expression of four putative tubulin and three putative elongation factor genes was similar in both strains and not statistically different , indicating that the mutation in strain Δfst <dig> did not impact expression of these house-keeping genes. the differentially expressed genes were functionally categorized based on gene ontology  annotation and placed into one of  <dig> groups . two-thirds of the genes were classified as encoding hypothetical proteins.table  <dig>

bexpression was measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . rna from biological replicate samples of wt or Δfst <dig> was pooled for cdna synthesis, and three technical replicates were analyzed for each gene. expression of tub <dig>  was used to normalize data. for each gene, values represent fold differences in Δfst <dig> with wt expression set at a value of  <dig>  expression of each gene was calculated as 2ΔΔct. range of expression is in parentheses equals  <dig> ΔΔct-s,  <dig> ΔΔct+s, where s equals the standard deviation of the 2ΔΔct value.



hydrophobin genes
eight hydrophobin genes have been identified in f. verticillioides, hyd1- <dig>  <cit> . hydrophobins are a group of small, cysteine-rich proteins expressed in filamentous fungi, which form a hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface on the surface of hyphae and conidia. rnaseq analysis revealed significant differences in the expression of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig>  with a  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold reduction and 54-fold increase, respectively, in strain Δfst <dig> . the differences in expression of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> were verified by qpcr . the expression of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyg <dig> was not significantly different. to test for defects in hydrophobicity, droplets of water or a detergent solution were placed on fungal mycelium of wt, Δfst <dig>  and the complemented strain fst1-comp. for all three strains, droplets of water maintained a spherical shape for more than 30 min. droplets of detergent solution on the wt and strain fst1-comp also remained intact . however, on strain Δfst <dig>  the droplet spread out over the surface of the mycelium, indicating a defect in hydrophobicity.table  <dig>

transcription factors
ma et al.  <cit>  predicted  <dig> putative transcription factor  genes in f. verticillioides and wiemann et al.  <cit>  predicted  <dig>  of these predicted tf, our analysis identified  <dig> differentially expressed . transcription factors in fungi have been classified into  <dig> families  <cit> , and we found that  <dig> of the differentially expressed tf genes were in  <dig> of the  <dig> families. most  of the tfs were c2h <dig> zinc finger  and zn2cys <dig> . fum <dig> is classified in the zn2cys <dig> family and its expression in Δfst <dig> was  <dig> -fold less compared to that of the wt . however, its p-value  was just outside the threshold we selected for statistical testing.

transporters
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes and  <dig> genes in the uniquely expressed category were classified as transporters . we separated the  <dig> differentially expressed transporter genes into seven categories: abc transporter, amino acid related transporter, ammonium related transporter, mineral/ion related transporter, major facilitator superfamily, sugar transporter, and uncategorized . in the categories for sugar and ammonium-related transporters, considerably more genes were up-regulated in strain Δfst <dig>  in contrast, most of the differentially expressed genes in the abc and mineral/ion transporter categories were down-regulated. expression of one putative inositol transporter  was decreased by 19-fold in strain Δfst <dig> compared to wt, which was verified by qpcr analysis  .table  <dig>

oxidases
a total of  <dig> of the differentially expressed genes were categorized with putative oxidase functions . compared to the wt, two-thirds of these genes exhibited reduced expression in strain Δfst <dig> and the other third were expressed at higher levels. additionally, the expression of  <dig> oxidase genes was only measured in the wt and seven only in Δfst <dig>  a word-search of the f. verticillioides genome database identified  <dig> putative peroxidase and seven catalase genes, and ten of these genes were differentially expressed. the peroxidase genes  were all down-regulated as much as 100-fold in strain Δfst <dig> compared to wt. four catalase genes  also were down-regulated in Δfst <dig>  expression of the putative catalases cat <dig>  and cat <dig>  was up-regulated 4-fold and 2-fold, respectively, in strain Δfst <dig>  we used qpcr analysis to measure the expression of peroxidases and catalases in both autoclaved kernels and infected living kernels. in autoclaved kernels, expression of three peroxidase genes  and three catalase genes  were found to be similar to expression indicated by the rnaseq results . qpcr analysis of the inoculated living kernels indicated similar effects on expression of the peroxidases and catalases .

secretome
the fungal secretome database  lists  <dig> genes in f. verticillioides that encode putative secreted proteins, and a comparison with the updated reference genome at the broad institute matched  <dig> of these genes. our rnaseq analysis indicated that  <dig> and  <dig> of the genes were expressed  in Δfst <dig> and wt, respectively, and significant differences were found in the expression of  <dig> genes. of these,  <dig>  genes were up-regulated in strain Δfst <dig> and  <dig>  genes were down-regulated. in addition, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> genes that were uniquely expressed in wt and Δfst <dig>  respectively. a previous study indicated that fst <dig> is preferentially expressed in endosperm tissue relative to expression in germ  <cit> ; therefore, we examined genes that encode secreted enzymes for starch and cell wall degradation, many that were previously described by ravalason et al.  <cit> . thirty-four differentially expressed genes were separated into five enzyme groups: cellulose-degrading, xylan-degrading, pectin-degrading, xylan/pectin-degrading and starch-degrading enzymes . all groups contained genes that were affected  by the mutation in strain Δfst <dig>  two genes with putative functions in starch degradation were expressed at reduced levels in strain Δfst <dig>  we measured the expression of one of these, agd <dig>  by qpcr and verified its reduction .table  <dig>

discussion
previous studies indicated that deletion of fst <dig> in f. verticillioides results in reduced fumonisin production and virulence  <cit> . here we have linked the mutation to increased sensitivity to h2o <dig>  reduced macroconidia production and reduced hydrophobicity. considering these diverse phenotypes, the goal of this research was to characterize the effects of fst <dig> on genome-wide expression during colonization of maize kernels. autoclaved kernels were chosen to eliminate the effects associated with reduced biomass and fungal development caused by the slower growth of the fst <dig> mutant when inoculated to living kernels. even without a living host environment, significant changes in transcription were found in the mutant, many of which may contribute to the observed phenotypes.

for our comparison of the transcriptomes of wt and Δfst <dig>  we relied on the f. verticillioides reference genome at the broad institute. recent updates in the annotation of the genome created changes in gene reference numbers and gene identifications. two changes were important to our study. first, the fum <dig> gene  was separated into two genes: fveg_ <dig> and  <dig>  in the original annotations, fum <dig> contained a 2532-bp open reading frame encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein described as the aminotransferase responsible for the condensation of alanine to the polyketide backbone of b-series fumonisins  <cit> . the disruption of fum <dig> in f. verticillioides, which blocks fumonisin production and mycotoxin production, was recovered in the mutant by complementation with the wt fum <dig> gene  <cit> . in the latest annotation of the genome, the sequence encoding the first  <dig> amino acids of fveg_ <dig> plus  <dig> additional amino acids was designated as fveg_ <dig>  and the sequence encoding the last  <dig> amino acids of fveg_ <dig>  which contains aminotransferase domain, was designated as fveg_ <dig>  regardless of this particular annotation error, expression of fum <dig> is significantly reduced in strain Δfst <dig> along with most of the other fum genes, confirming the role of fst <dig> in fumonisin production.

the second peculiar annotation change in the reference genome was that for fst <dig> . originally listed as a “hypothetical protein”, with similarity to hexose transporters, the gene is now listed as a “myo-inositol transporter”. inositol is a polyol that functions as an essential constituent of cell membranes as derivatives of phosphatidylinositol and as important cell signaling molecules of inositol phosphates  <cit> . two myo-inositol transporter genes have been described in s. cerevisiae by complementation of a strain defective in myo-inositol uptake  <cit> . a blast analysis of the f. verticillioides genome with the yeast itr1p sequence identified eight genes with high sequence similarity . the sequence of fst <dig> was not identified by the search. among the eight identified genes, expression was significantly down-regulated in Δfst <dig> for fveg_ <dig>   and fveg_ <dig> , while the expression of fveg_ <dig> was significantly up-regulated . we measured the expression of itr <dig> by qpcr and verified that its expression was significantly reduced . in light of these observations, the assignment of the functional role of myo-inositol transporter to fst <dig> is premature.

kim and woloshuk  <cit>  described the phenotype of Δfst <dig> as having slower growth and symptom development, and thus reduced virulence, compared to wt on wound-inoculated maize kernels. this growth inhibition was not observed on autoclaved kernels  <cit> . we hypothesized that the reduced virulence of Δfst <dig> resulted from an increased sensitivity to the effects of reactive oxygen species , which includes h2o <dig> produced by the living kernel  <cit> . the greater inhibition of the growth of strain Δfst <dig> by h2o <dig> compared to the wt and fst1-comp strains supports this hypothesis.

during pathogenesis, f. verticillioides could encounter ros produced in maize kernels through several independent pathways. kim and woloshuk  <cit>  inoculated the crown of maize kernels at the r <dig>  stage of development, a period when the endosperm tissue is undergoing program cell death   <cit> . ros molecules, including h2o <dig>  are produced during pcd in plants  <cit>  and likely during endosperm development  <cit> . ros production is also a characterized response of plants to pathogen invasion and plays a major role in host defense  <cit> . most pathogens respond to ros by the production of peroxidases and catalases  <cit> . our rnaseq analysis of f. verticillioides grown on autoclaved kernels identified several putative catalases and peroxidases whose expression was changed in Δfst <dig> mutants. four putative peroxidase genes were down-regulated in Δfst <dig>  as were four of the six putative catalases. we also found that these oxidases were similarly affected in living kernels infected with the f. verticillioides strains.

to gain greater insight into a possible function of the catalases and how they may affect virulence, we examined their function in other plant pathogens. catalases have been separated by phylogenetic analysis into four clades: peroxisomal, cytoplasmic, spore-specific, and secreted  <cit> . we found sequence similarity in the five differentially expressed catalases from our study when compared to the catalases assigned to the four clades in giles  <cit> . fveg_ <dig> was most similar to xp <dig> in neurospora crassa and fg <dig> in gibberella zeae, both of which belong to the peroxisomal catalase . fveg_ <dig> was similar to fg <dig> in g. zeae, which belongs to the cytoplasmic catalase . fveg_ <dig> was similar to aak <dig> in n. crassa and fg <dig> in g. zeae, which belong to the spore-specific catalase . sequence analysis of the n-termini of the five predicted catalase proteins indicated that none are secreted.

as mentioned, catalases also have an important role in fungal development, including conidiogenesis. the sequences of the five differentially expressed, putative catalases in f. verticillioides are highly similar to catb in magnaporthe grisea, cata and catb in a. nidulans, cat <dig> and cat <dig> in n. crassa, and catb in blumeria graminis. in m. grisea, catb is up regulated during infection of rice  <cit> . a strain disrupted in catb was reduced in virulence with increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and was severely affected in conidia production. in addition, cata mutants in a. nidulans exhibited reduction in conidiation and increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . the vast majority of conidial produced by f. verticillioides are microconidia. although the number of macroconidia produced by the wt used in our study comprised only about 7% of the total conidia population, the reduction of macroconidia was consistently observed in strain Δfst <dig>  from our study, it is not possible to determine if the altered expression of the five catalases in strain Δfst <dig> is responsible for the reduced production of macroconidia.

aside from the role of catalases in conidial development, transcription factors are known to impact conidiation in fungi, and the expression of several putative tf genes were down-regulated in strain Δfst <dig>  these genes include fveg_ <dig> similar to ren <dig> of fusarium oxysporum, fveg_ <dig> and fveg_ <dig> similar to brla and abaa of a. nidulans, respectively, fveg_ <dig> similar to fl  in n. crassa, and fveg_ <dig> similar to fgsg_ <dig> in f. graminearum. mutants of ren <dig> and abaa fail to produce normal conidia because of developmental malfunctions associated with phialides, the conidiogenous cells  <cit> . mutants of brla fail to produce conidiophores  <cit>  and fl mutants fail to produce conidia in chains  <cit> . furthermore, expression of the conidiation-specific gene con- <dig> is not induced in fl mutants of n. crassa. in strain Δfst <dig>  a gene  with high sequence identity to con- <dig> was down-regulated 14-fold compared to the wt. in f. graminearum, son et al.  <cit>  reported that deletion of fgsg_ <dig> results in a reduction in conidia production but no effect on virulence. we measured the expression of fl-like gene  by qpcr . the expression was  <dig> -fold of wt, which is near the  <dig> -fold reduction obtained from the rnaseq analysis. these results indicate that reduced expression of one or more of these tfs may impact production of macroconidia but not microconidia.

hydrophobins are another family of proteins that are associated with conidiogenesis as well as aerial hypha formation and have been shown to be involved in virulence  <cit> . hydrophobins are separated into two classes based on spacing of cysteine residues and physical characteristics. class i hydrophobins are highly insoluble proteins that form rodlets, and class ii are more soluble and do not form rodlets. fuchs et al.  <cit>  predicted that hydrophobin genes in f. verticillioides encode three class i proteins  and two class ii proteins . examination of the protein sequences derived from hyd <dig>  and hyd <dig>  suggests they are class ii and class i hydrophobins, respectively. we could not discern the class of hyd <dig>  based on sequence alignments. mutants of f. verticillioides with deletions of hyd <dig> or hyd <dig> are not defective in radial growth, conidial numbers, or corn seedling infection. however, these mutants fail to form microconidial chains  <cit> . expression of these two genes was unaffected in Δfst <dig> and the strain produced normal microconidial chains. we observed the spreading of droplets of detergent solution placed on the surface of strain Δfst <dig>  suggesting a deficiency in the more soluble class ii hydrophobins  <cit> . the down-regulated expression of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> in strain Δfst <dig> is likely associated with this phenotype.

previous studies have shown that fumonisin production and fst <dig> expression are higher in the endosperm than in germ tissues  <cit> . these observations suggest that components within the endosperm provide an environment conducive for the pathogen. strain Δfst <dig> grows as well as the wt on autoclaved maize, implying that it produces the secreted enzymes needed to breakdown macromolecules in the kernel and transporters to move nutrients into growing hyphae. however, our transcriptome results indicate that the mutation in fst <dig> greatly impacts the expression of several genes that encode secreted enzymes. we found that the expression of genes encoding enzymes that degrade complex carbohydrate polymers, which make up host cell walls, was altered in strain Δfst <dig>  but not uniformly. the lack of a growth phenotype in the mutant when grown on autoclaved maize and culture media may reflect functional redundancy in these large gene families  <cit> . for example, the expression of the alpha-amylase gene fveg_ <dig>  <cit>  was not affected in strain Δfst <dig>  expression of this gene would likely mask the potential effects caused by the down regulation of the two starch degradation genes .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we described three new phenotypes associated with a mutation in fst <dig> that may contribute to the reduced virulence phenotype, namely the increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, reduction of macroconidia production, and changes in mycelial hydrophobicity associated with Δfst <dig> mutants. we propose that reduced resistance to h2o <dig> in Δfst <dig> may impede the strain’s ability to respond to ros encountered during pathogenesis. our analysis of the transcriptomes of wt and Δfst <dig> indicated that the mutation of fst <dig> affects the expression of 17% of the genes in f. verticillioides. among the genes affected were many that impact mycotoxin biosynthesis, virulence, resistance to h2o <dig>  and conidiogenesis. our study supports the hypothesis that fst <dig> has a role other than sugar transport. other researchers have described putative sugar transporters that appear to have broader functions. mutants of rco- <dig> in n. crassa displayed altered responses to increasing glucose concentrations in culture media  <cit> . the authors suggested that rco- <dig> functions as a sugar sensor and a regulator of conidia production. in magnaporthe oryzae, mutations affecting most <dig> result in reduced conidiation and production of the secondary metabolite melanin  <cit> . the authors were not able to complement the defects by expression of other sugar transporter genes. further studies are needed to determine how these genes  regulate the function of multiple cell processes.
