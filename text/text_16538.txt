BACKGROUND
glycosphingolipids  represent a large family of glycoconjugates, which are found abundantly on cellular membranes. gsl are classified into different series defined by their respective core structures. in vertebrates, the main gsl series are called ganglio-, lacto-, globo-, isoglobo-, and muco-series  <cit> . the functional significance of gsl is diverse since these glycoconjugates have been implicated in processes such as cell adhesion, cell migration, regulation of signaling proteins and binding of pathogens and toxins  <cit> . the repertoire of gsl expressed by an organism is subject to changes according to cell type and developmental stage. consequently, several stem cell and differentiation markers of early embryonic development, such as the stage-specific embryonic antigens ssea- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  represent carbohydrate epitopes carried by gsl  <cit> .

the diversity of gsl is shaped by the action of multiple glycosyltransferase enzymes localized in the golgi apparatus. the inactivation of key glycosyltransferase genes allows investigation of the functional specificity of individual gsl structures or of a whole gsl series. the β <dig>  n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-v  enzyme initiates the formation of the lactoseries gsl by transferring glcnac in a β <dig> -linkage to lactosylceramide. this transfer event leads to the synthesis of the lc <dig> structure   <cit> . the b3gnt <dig> gene is expressed during mouse development and then again later mainly in the spleen and placenta in adult mice. additionally b3gnt <dig> transcripts are found in the adult mouse brain where b3gnt <dig> expression is limited to cerebellar purkinje cells  <cit> .

the b3gnt <dig> enzyme has been shown to be key in the expression of sulfoglucuronylglycolipids  in the developing nervous system  <cit> . sggl are expressed in a regulated manner during embryonic brain development and again postnatally  <cit> . for example, sggl carry the hnk- <dig> epitope, which has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity  <cit> . in addition, the developmentally regulated expression of sggl coincides with certain cell migration and differentiation phases  <cit> .

the b3gnt <dig> enzyme also initiates the formation of the ssea- <dig> epitope, which is identical to the lewis x antigen. ssea- <dig> corresponds to the trisaccharide galβ <dig> glcnac which is first found on 8-cell stage embryos and in mouse embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . the ssea- <dig> epitope, which is mainly found on lactoseries derived gsl, is believed to participate in the regulation of cell adhesion during embryogenesis, cell differentiation, and development of the neuronal system  <cit> . in order to study the developmental and physiological processes mediated by lactoseries derived gsl, we have inactivated the b3gnt <dig> gene in mice by homologous recombination in es cells. this mouse model suggests an essential contribution of the lactoseries derived gsl series in the very early stages of mouse development.

RESULTS
to address the functional role of the b3gnt <dig> gene in mouse development and physiology, we inactivated this gene by homologous recombination in mouse es cells. the b3gnt <dig> targeting vector  was electroporated into r <dig> and tc <dig> es cells. after selection with g <dig> and screening of  <dig> cell clones, we identified four es cell clones bearing the homologous recombined allele. the homologous recombination at the b3gnt <dig> locus was confirmed using both pcr and genomic southern blot analysis. the genomic southern probe distinguished between the wildtype and the null allele by producing diagnostic ecori fragments of  <dig> kbp and  <dig>  kbp, respectively . the absence of chromosomal aberrations was verified by karyotyping the four homologously recombined es cells .

the inactivation of the b3gnt <dig> gene was confirmed by measuring the level of n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity in targeted es cells. the enzymatic activity towards the artificial acceptor galp-nitrophenol and towards lactosylceramide was assayed in wildtype and in b3gnt5-targeted es cells. the transfer of glcnac to galp-nitrophenol was reduced in r <dig> and in tc <dig> b3gnt5-targeted es cells, but did not reached 50% of the activity measured in wildtype cells . when using lactosylceramide, the physiological acceptor of the b3gnt <dig> enzyme, the n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity detected in the targeted es cells was indeed reduced to 50% of the normal levels this demonstrating the loss of a functional b3gnt <dig> allele.

the four es cell clones bearing the b3gnt5-null allele were injected into c57bl/ <dig> blastocysts to produce chimeric offspring. two male chimeric founders were obtained from the blastocysts microinjected with the two r <dig> es cell clones, whereas the microinjection of tc <dig> es cells did not yield any viable offspring. the chimeric males were mated with wildtype c57bl/ <dig> females and the f <dig> progeny screened with pcr for germ line transmission of the disrupted allele. both chimeric males transmitted the null allele to their progeny. offspring positive for the disrupted gene were backcrossed onto the c57bl/ <dig> background for five generations. all the heterozygous offspring obtained from the chimeric males were grossly normal. both male and females carriers of the null allele were obtained. heterozygote mice were then bred to produce homozygous-null offspring. after crossing  <dig> independent heterozygote breeding pairs, no homozygous-null offspring were detected . the ratio of wildtype to heterozygous-null mice was 34% to 66%, thus corresponding to a mendelian allele distribution assuming a complete lethality of homozygous-null offspring. since the expression of the b3gnt <dig> gene was shown to be elevated in embryos by mid-gestation  <cit> , we genotyped  <dig> embryos isolated at e <dig> to assess whether homozygous-null embryos could be detected. the size and morphology of the embryos isolated at that stage were normal  and the genotypic analysis demonstrated that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of embryos were wildtype and heterozygous-null, respectively . notably, no sites of resorption were observed in the uteri examined at mid-gestation. to identify whether the lack of embryonic development in b3gnt5-null mice was related to an implantation defect, we setup time-matings of heterozygous-null mice and examined the genotype of resulting embryos at the blastocyst stage. again, no homozygous-null embryos were detected , thereby indicating that the b3gnt <dig> gene is required for blastocyst development.

since no homozygous-null embryos could be recovered, we analyzed the expression pattern of b3gnt <dig> in pre-implantation embryos to confirm that the gene was indeed expressed during early embryogenesis. in situ hybridization showed the presence of the b3gnt <dig> transcript already at the 2-cell stage. the expression was uniform in all embryonic stages up to the morula stage. in blastocysts, b3gnt <dig> expression was confined to the inner cell mass, as no signal was observed in trophoblast cells . the expression of the b3gnt <dig> gene throughout early embryogenesis was compatible with the finding of a pre-implantation lethality in b3gnt5-null mice.

the inner cell mass of blastocysts is the source of es cells used for gene targeting. accordingly, we examined the level of b3gnt <dig> gene expression in the r <dig> and tc <dig> es cells by quantitative pcr. the b3gnt <dig> mrna levels were identical in the two cell lines and comparable to the expression of the housekeeping polr2a polymerase gene . because the b3gnt <dig> enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the lactoseries derived gsl, we also analyzed gsl profiles quantitatively in wildtype and in b3gnt5-targeted r <dig> and tc <dig> es cells. gsl were isolated from es cells by organic solvent extraction and digested by ceramide glycanase to release the carbohydrate moiety. the resulting oligosaccharides were labeled with 2-aminobenzamide at their reducing end and separated by hplc  <cit> . the comparison between wildtype and b3gnt5-targeted es cells showed decreased amounts of several gsl structures . the lactoseries gsl lc <dig>  the product of the b3gnt <dig> enzyme, was not detected in es cells. however, its elongation products, the lactoseries derived lc <dig> and lc <dig> were identified and found to be present at lower levels in b3gnt5-targeted es cells. the decreased amounts of gsl found in b3gnt5-targeted es cells were not limited to lacto-series gsl, since the gangliosides gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gd <dig> and the globosides gb <dig>  gb <dig> were also reduced. the identity of the oligosaccharide structures detected by hplc was confirmed by mass-spectrometry. the oligosaccharide sequences were further examined by fragmentation analysis . this analysis of gsl profiles on es cells demonstrated the contribution of the b3gnt <dig> enzyme to the formation of lactoseries derived gsl.

discussion
by disrupting the b3gnt <dig> gene, we aimed to improve current appreciation of the functions of lactoseries derived gsl in vivo. our study suggests an essential role of this gsl series in pre-implantation embryonic development by showing that b3gnt5-null blastocysts could not be retrieved from heterozygous matings. the expression of the b3gnt <dig> gene from the two-cell stage up to the blastocyst stage would suggest a role for lactoseries derived gsl in cell-cell adhesion, possibly contributing to embryo compaction and implantation. similarly, the ssea- <dig> antigen has been shown to mediate the tight adhesion of blastomeres, since the addition of multivalent ssea- <dig> structures promotes embryo decompaction  <cit> . the formation of the ssea- <dig> antigen requires the action of the α <dig>  fucosyltransferase fut <dig>  <cit> . the disruption of the fut <dig> gene in mice abolished the formation of the ssea- <dig> antigen in pre-implantation embryos, but this loss did not affect the compaction and implantation processes  <cit> . this finding showed that the fucose residue is critical for marking the antigen but that fucose is dispensable for the potential adhesion properties of the lactoseries derived structure.

the early lethality observed in the b3gnt <dig> gene disruption model contrasts with the phenotype described for mice lacking the ceramide glucosyltransferase ugcg gene, which initiates gsl biosynthesis . ugcg homozygous-null embryos have been reported to die between embryonic days e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> . since ugcg activity is required for the formation of lactoseries derived gsl, the reverse order would be expected for the onset of lethality in the ugcg and b3gnt <dig> gene disruptions. a similar paradoxical situation was observed in the globoside gsl pathway when comparing the phenotypes resulting from the disruptions of the α <dig>  galactosyltransferase gb3-synthase  <cit>  and β <dig>  n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase gb4-synthase  <cit>  genes. mice lacking the gb3-synthase gene developed normally and did not show any physiological abnormality  <cit> . by contrast, the disruption of the gb4-synthase gene arrested development at the blastocyst stage and prevented the implantation of mouse embryos  <cit> . this apparent discrepancy may have different causes. it is possible that the loss of ugcg activity is compensated for by other glycosyltransferase activities expressed during pre-implantation stages. however, no glycosyltransferase has been described with such activity yet and no proteins similar to the ugcg enzyme could be retrieved from the mouse genome so far. alternatively, it is possible that the expression of the ugcg gene in unfertilized oocytes  <cit>  yields enough of the ugcg enzyme to sustain the formation of glc-cer until gastrulation.

the enzymatic characterization of the b3gnt <dig> protein has shown a significant n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity towards the monosaccharide gal  <cit> . therefore it is conceivable that b3gnt <dig> may act on gal-termini found on n- or o-linked glycans. however, it is likely that pre-implantation lethality is in fact mediated by a defect of gsl biosynthesis, since defects in n- or o-linked glycan elongations lead to post-implantation lethal phenotypes at the earliest  <cit> . indeed, the inactivation of the b3gnt <dig> gene, a paralog of b3gnt <dig> that mediates the formation of poly-n-acetyllactosamine chains on glycoproteins, does not impair embryonic development  <cit> .

even if the pre-implantation lethality observed in the b3gnt5-null embryos is caused by a defect of gsl biosynthesis, the question remains whether the loss of b3gnt <dig> solely affects the lactoseries derived gsl pathway. our analysis of gsl profiles in es cells bearing a b3gnt5-null allele showed decreased levels of additional gsl structures, such as the gangliosides gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gd <dig> and the globosides gb <dig>  gb <dig> . earlier work has documented the physical interaction of glycosyltransferases involved in gsl biosynthesis  <cit> , suggesting that the loss of a single enzyme might destabilize the localization and thereby the activity of other enzymes.

CONCLUSIONS
the disruption of the b3gnt <dig> gene leads to the earliest lethality reported for a golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, thereby underlining the essential role of lactoseries derived gsl and possibly of protein-bound β3glcnac-linked glycans in pre-implantation embryogenesis. because of this early lethality, the role of these glycoconjugates in subsequent developmental pathways could not be determined in the present model. the expression pattern of the b3gnt <dig> gene at gastrulation and at later stages would support the involvement of b3gnt <dig> products in processes such as neurogenesis and brain development. the production of a conditional b3gnt <dig> gene targeting model will certainly bring new insights on the role of lactoseries derived gsl in organ development and functions.
