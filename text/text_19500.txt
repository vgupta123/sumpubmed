BACKGROUND
acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is an acidophilic, chemolithoautotrophic bacterium that derives energy from the oxidation of ferrous iron, elemental sulfur and reduced sulfur compounds  <cit> . this bacterium has been successfully used in bioleaching to recover metals from low-grade sulfide ores. during the bioleaching process, a. ferrooxidans is subjected to extreme growth conditions, such as temperature increase, ph fluctuations, nutrient starvation, and the presence of heavy metals  <cit> , all of which can affect the efficiency of metal recovery.

temperature change is one of the most common environmental stresses that can influence essential bacterial processes such as energy transduction and growth. all organisms tend to respond to environmental stresses with a rapid transient increase in heat shock protein  synthesis. hsps act either as molecular chaperones, mediating the correct folding and assembly of proteins, or as proteases, irreversibly degrading unfolded proteins  <cit> . the hsps are usually classified according to their molecular weights, and the small hsps  include the categories hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> 

the shsps are characterized by a molecular mass of between  <dig> and  <dig> kda and the presence of  <dig> to  <dig> residues that constitute the α-crystallin domain, which is flanked by c- and n-terminals that present lower similarity. the n-terminus is critical to α-hsp activity in vivo, playing a role in α-hsp oligomerization and substrate binding  <cit> . the α-crystallin domain is known to possess a molecular chaperone role  <cit> , and the c-terminal extension maintains α-hsp solubility, stability, and chaperone activity  <cit> .

the shsps have been extensively studied due to their importance in protecting cellular proteins and maintaining cellular viability under intensive stress conditions, which is particularly important for extremophile microorganisms. interestingly, most extremophiles posses one or two shsps, and species harboring at least  <dig> shsp genes are mostly from the archea domain. however, three shsp genes have been identified in the genome of a. ferrooxidans atcc  <dig>  <cit> .

xiao et al.  <cit>  showed that there could be significant differences in the expression levels of a. ferrooxidans atcc  <dig> shsp genes in response to heat shock. these findings suggest that a. ferrooxidans shsp genes may be controlled by different regulatory mechanisms, which could be related to specialized functions of the genes. in this study, the expression levels of three shsp genes  were investigated in the a. ferrooxidans lr strain subjected to heat shock. phylogenetic analysis and comparative molecular modeling were used to provide new insights concerning the structure and function of the shsps from a. ferrooxidans.

methods
bacterial strain and growth conditions
the brazilian strain a. ferrooxidans lr  <cit>  was grown at 30°c and  <dig> rpm in modified t&k liquid medium  <cit>  containing  <dig>  g/l k2hpo <dig> h2o,  <dig>  g/l mgso <dig> h2o,  <dig>  g/l 2so <dig>  and  <dig>  g/l feso <dig> h2o. the ph was adjusted to  <dig>  with sulfuric acid. for the heat shock experiments, a. ferrooxidans lr cells were grown in t&k liquid medium until 50% oxidation of fe2+ was reached. the cells were then collected, inoculated into  <dig> ml of t&k liquid medium, and incubated at 40°c and  <dig> rpm for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes.

rna isolation
the total rna was isolated from three independent a. ferrooxidans cultures, according to the procedure described by paulino et al.  <cit> . the cells were suspended in a solution containing  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm licl, and  <dig> mm tris-hcl, at ph  <dig> . the rna fraction was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol  containing 10%  sds, precipitated at -20°c with 2%  potassium acetate at ph  <dig>  and 100%  ethanol, and resuspended in depc-treated water. the rna was treated with dnase  for  <dig> h at 37°c, and stored at -70°c.

quantitative real-time pcr 
the relative expressions of afe_ <dig>  afe_ <dig>  and afe_ <dig> were determined by qrt-pcr  <cit> . the cdnas were synthesized with the thermoscript rt-pcr system kit . the alas gene was used as the endogenous control  <cit> . the primers used in the experiments were designed with the primer <dig> program http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/, employing the entire coding region of the selected genes from the a. ferrooxidans atcc  <dig> genome . the specificity of the primers was confirmed by pcr using genomic dna from a. ferrooxidans lr.

the qrt-pcr experiments were performed in triplicate using a  <dig> real time pcr system , and threshold cycle  numbers were determined using real time system rq study software v.  <dig> . <dig> . the qrt-pcr reactions were performed in triplicate using platinum sybr green qpcr supermix-udg . after thermal cycling, a dissociation  curve analysis was performed to ensure the specificity of the amplifications and the absence of primer-dimer and unspecific amplifications. the relative gene expression was calculated according to the comparative critical threshold method  described by livak and schmittgen  <cit> . the statistical significance of the qrt-pcr data was determined using the student's t-test .

bioinformatics analysis
the a. ferrooxidans atcc  <dig> genome  was used to search for genes encoding shsps. clustal w was employed to align the shsp sequences from a. ferrooxidans with sequences found in other bacteria. the alignment was edited with the genedoc program  <cit> .

prediction of the transcription start site was performed with bprom software . a widely accepted theoretical informational approach was adopted to identify potential σ <dig> sites  <cit> . since the σ <dig> binding site comprises two conserved blocks , separated by a gap of variable length, two positional weight matrices  were generated, each one based on complementary information from the - <dig> and - <dig> binding sites. the frequency matrix was based on a set of eighteen v. cholerae σ <dig> promoters  <cit> , including the extended σ <dig> promoter, with  <dig> positions in the - <dig> element and  <dig> positions in the - <dig> element, separated by a spacer of variable length. using the pwms as a scoring function, putative - <dig> and - <dig> regions of σ <dig> were searched on  <dig> bases upstream from the atg start codon of the a. ferrooxidans shsp genes. each site was scored for its degree of matching to the σ <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> pwms.

phylogenetic analysis
a search was performed against all complete bacterial genomes , using ncbi's microbial genome blast tool http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi?organism=microb and the protein sequences from afe_ <dig>  afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> as queries. the  <dig> best hits for each a. ferrooxidans shsp were selected to build an alignment using mafft v <dig> b http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/software/. the alignment containing  <dig> aligned residues was used to produce a maximum likelihood  tree using phyml  <dig>  software http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/. the pam matrix procedure  <cit>  was used to calculate genetic distances, and statistical support for the nodes employed alrt statistics  <cit> .

molecular modeling
psi-blast search against the protein data bank  using the three a. ferrooxidans shsps  resulted only in templates with low sequence identity . however, fold assignment searches using the pgenthreader algorithm implemented in the psipred server  <cit>  returned two structures that had significant scores, both of which displayed well-conserved α-crystallin domains. the crystal structures of hsp <dig>  from wheat   <cit>  and hsp <dig>  from methanococcus jannaschii  were used as three-dimensional templates for molecular modeling of the α-crystallin domain. the n-terminal region was modeled using only the whsp <dig>  structure as template. template and target sequences were aligned using the mgenthreader server  <cit> , and were carefully examined to confirm the alignment accuracy. comparative protein modeling by satisfaction of spatial restraints was carried out using the program modeller 9v <dig>  <cit> . fifty models were built for each shsp from a. ferrooxidans, and all models were evaluated with the dope potential. models of each protein with the lower global score were selected for explicit solvent molecular dynamics  simulation, using gromacs  <cit>  to check for stability and consistency. the overall and local quality of the final model was assessed by verify3d  <cit> , prosa  <cit>  and vadar  <cit> . three-dimensional structures were displayed, analyzed, and compared using the programs coot  <cit>  and pymol  <cit> .

RESULTS
the shsps from a. ferrooxidans
search of the a. ferrooxidans atcc  <dig> genome  revealed the presence of three shsp genes  belonging to the hsp <dig> family. according to han and co-workers  <cit> , about 71% of the microbial organisms with completed annotated genomes possess one or two shsp genes, and 10% of the archaea species have more than three shsp-related genes. notably, the genome of bradyrhizobium japonicum  possesses  <dig> shsp-related genes  <cit> .

laksanalamai and robb  <cit>  showed that the degree of identity of the shsps from several extremophiles possessing only one shsp was 75%, while the identity of shsps from the same organism ranged from  <dig> to 50%. the low sequence identity for the a. ferrooxidans shsps  is therefore intriguing.

afe_ <dig>  afe_ <dig>  and afe_ <dig> are not organized in an operon in the a. ferrooxidans genome. indeed, most of the known shsp genes are not arranged in operons  <cit> , with some exceptions such as the escherichia coli ibpab operon, which contains two shsp genes   <cit> , and bradyrhizobium japonicum, which has shsp genes found as independent units and others grouped in the same operon  <cit> .

shsp genes expression in a. ferrooxidans lr cells subjected to heat shock
qrt-pcr was used to determine the transcript levels of the afe_ <dig>  afe_ <dig>  and afe_ <dig> genes in a. ferrooxidans lr cells grown at 30°c  or subjected to a 40°c heat shock for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes . the qrt-pcr results indicate that after  <dig> minutes all three shsp genes were significantly up-regulated , although the expression level of afe_ <dig> was considerably lower than the expression levels of afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig>  the expression level for afe_ <dig> was 20-fold higher than that observed for afe_ <dig>  and  <dig> -fold higher than the expression level of afe_ <dig>  xiao et al.  <cit>  observed a similar pattern of expression for the afe_ <dig> gene. our results for afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> were dissimilar to those obtained by xiao et al.  <cit> . however, this comparison may not be reliable due to differences in the a. ferrooxidans strains as well as the heat shock experiments used in the two studies.

the observed differences in the expressions of the three a. ferrooxidans shsp genes suggest possible regulatory differences. in many bacteria, the σ <dig> factor regulates the expression of the shsp-encoding genes in a temperature-dependent manner  <cit> . under stress conditions, the transcription of heat shock genes is induced following a rapid and transient increase of this factor  <cit> . a bioinformatics analysis was therefore performed in the deduced - <dig> and - <dig> regions of the three shsp genes. the results indicated that the three genes had possible σ32-dependent promoters . in the work undertaken by xiao et al.  <cit> , σ32-dependent promoters were only found for the afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> genes. however, the disparities between the two studies can be explained by the different in silico strategies chosen.

in a. ferrooxidans, the - <dig> motif at the σ <dig> binding site appears to be more conserved than the - <dig> motif. the same occurs for the v. cholerae and the e. coli σ <dig> consensus sequences  <cit> . in spite of the different expression levels observed for the a. ferrooxidans shsp genes, the bioinformatics analyses did not reveal any other type of regulation mechanism . however, within the σ32-regulated genes, alternative mechanisms of regulation are possible. münchbach and co-workers  <cit>  used subtractive two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify a set of  <dig> shsps in b. japonicum subjected to a temperature shift from 28°c to 43°c. these authors observed that the amounts of the shsps were quite dissimilar, suggesting the existence of a diverse regulatory repertoire.

phylogenetic analysis and comparative sequence analysis
the ml analysis suggested that the three shsps from a. ferrooxidans are not recent paralogs . this finding is in accordance with the low sequence similarity between the shsps from a. ferrooxidans . the sequence divergence among the a. ferrooxidans shsps is likely to be the consequence of horizontal transfer of one or even two genes; however, the possibility of divergent evolution  <cit>  caused by different selective pressures cannot be fully discarded. to gain more insight into the origins of the a. ferrooxidans shsps, the cg content of each gene was compared with the average cg content of a. ferrooxidans coding-genes . the cg contents of afe_ <dig>  and afe_ <dig>  were statistically different from the average a. ferrooxidans cg content , while for afe_ <dig>  there was no significant difference . these findings suggest that afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> could be inherited horizontally by a. ferrooxidans. interestingly, the closely related species a. caldus from the same genus has only one shsp gene, which is the possible ortholog of a. ferrooxidans afe_ <dig>  considering the hypothesis of horizontal transfer origins of afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig>  it is likely that a. caldus has lost the ortholog of afe_ <dig>  and maintained the ortholog of afe_ <dig>  in this scenario, the lateral transference that originated afe_ <dig> occurred prior to the divergence between these two species.

the n-terminal region showed no significant sequence similarity to other shsps with well-defined chaperone activity , but secondary structure prediction tools indicated that all of the sequences analyzed had the propensity to form the α-helical structures that are considered key elements for substrate binding and stabilization of the oligomeric structure. furthermore, the n-terminal region alone was capable of interacting with denatured proteins  <cit> , and its truncation reduces the chaperone activity of shsps  <cit> . these findings emphasize that this region contains the substrate binding site, and is therefore important for the chaperone activity.

structural modeling of the shsps from a. ferrooxidans
in silico three-dimensional models of the proteins encoded by afe_ <dig>  afe_ <dig>  and afe_ <dig> displayed excellent global and local stereochemical properties, with a z-score  of around - <dig>  and all residues lying within the allowed regions of the ramachandran plot. a good z-score means that it is within the range of scores typically found for native proteins of similar size. rmsd analysis of the template crystal structures and the developed models resulted in values below  <dig>  Å for the main-chain backbone of the α-crystallin domain, suggesting that the models were suitable for structural and comparative analyses.

the α-crystallin domains of the proteins encoded by afe_ <dig>  afe_ <dig>  and afe_ <dig> share similar structural features with other shsps from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. this domain  shows a β-sandwich fold composed of seven β-strands in two sheets . the n-terminal region , encompassing two helical segments, was only observed in the structure of whsp <dig>  from wheat  <cit> . in the whsp <dig>  structure, the n-terminal helices participate in the stabilization of the oligomeric structure, establishing interactions with the adjacent α-crystallin domain  <cit> . the c-terminal extension  displays a random coil conformation and has a critical role in the formation of the oligomeric state. however, different to the proteins encoded by afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig>  the afe_ <dig> protein has a rare shortened c-terminus, which may prevent the formation of a stable oligomer and could be involved in the modulation of the protein chaperone activity. canonically, the long loop, which is responsible for dimerization, is fully conserved, and the identification of functional regions by surface-mapping of phylogenetic information, using the consurf web server  <cit> , indicates that all residues considered essential for dimerization are fully conserved in the three shsps from a. ferrooxidans.

in order to gain insights into the oligomeric state of the proteins encoded by afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig>  which possess the extended c-terminus, analysis was performed of the structural determinants required for assembling into either a dodecameric double disk  or a spherical shell composed of  <dig> monomers . in both the whsp <dig>  and the mjhsp <dig>  structures, the intermolecular interactions made by the c-terminal extension are virtually identical, despite the fact that the c-terminus of whsp <dig>  requires two different orientations to form the oligomer. this ability of the c-terminus to adopt two conformations resides in the amino acid segment between the strands β  <dig> and β  <dig>  which permits a hinge movement. analysis of the c-terminus contacts in the mjhsp <dig>  structure showed that the segment between the strands β  <dig> and β  <dig> adopts a conformation stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the oεglu <dig> and nεgln <dig> atoms, and the carbonyl oxygen of the glu <dig> and nζlys <dig> atoms. surprisingly, these contacts are not found in the whsp <dig>  structure, due to the presence of a second pro residue at position  <dig> that enables the segment to fold into a stable motif, generating a 6-residue segment  with high flexibility, which allows the hinge movement. in both afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> protein sequences, this segment does not contain a proline residue at the same relative position, and the residues populating this segment have all the requirements to form a stable motif in the same way as the mjhsp <dig>  structure. thus, based on our structural findings, we suggest that both afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> proteins behave like the prokaryotic shsp from m. jannaschii, adopting a 24-molecule hollow spherical shell. however, additional experimental data obtained using techniques that can provide insights into hydrodynamic behavior, such as dynamic light scattering, ultra-centrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography and small angle x-ray scattering, are required to confirm our in silico predictions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have demonstrated that the expression level of the a. ferrooxidans afe_ <dig> gene is considerable higher than that of the afe_ <dig> gene, and that the three shsp genes harbor possible σ32-dependent promoters. the three shsps from a. ferrooxidans are not recent paralogs, while the genes afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> can be inherited horizontally by a. ferrooxidans. this suggests that the shsps encoded by afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> are more likely to act as molecular chaperones in the a. ferrooxidans heat shock response. these findings were corroborated by molecular modeling showing that both afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> proteins behave like the prokaryotic shsp from m. jannaschii, a well characterized shsp with chaperone activity.
