BACKGROUND
all aerobic bacteria produce toxic oxygen derivatives as by-products of their metabolism. therefore, they have evolved complex defence and repair mechanisms to protect themselves from the damaging effects of emerging reactive oxygen species   <cit> . these mechanisms allow bacteria to cope with oxidative stress and the imbalance between ros-generating and ros-defence processes  <cit> . a direct detoxification of ros is catalysed by such enzymes as superoxide dismutases , catalases and peroxidases  <cit> . surprisingly, strictly anaerobic bacteria express comparable detoxifying systems, such as the sod, but little is known about their role and the possibility of ros protection in these organisms  <cit> .

as a cofactor of several enzymes and regulatory proteins, iron is an essential element for living organisms. iron is mainly present in two forms, either as soluble ferrous iron fe or as insoluble ferric iron fe. in oxic environments, only fe is energetically stable  <cit> , while in anoxic habitats, reduction to fe occurs chemically by organic compounds, such as sulphides  <cit> . bacteria possess numerous highly efficient iron acquisition systems to scavenge iron from the environment under iron-restricted conditions, such as the synthesis and secretion of high affinity extracellular ferric chelators called siderophores  <cit> . however, siderophores can have physiological roles aside from those involved in iron acquisition; one such example is siderophores acting as protectors against oxidative stress  <cit> . although iron is essential for bacteria, iron potentiates oxygen toxicity by the production of hydroxyl radicals via the fenton reaction. fenton-like reactions are not restricted to iron as the reactive metal component. other metals, such as copper, which is required for many cellular enzymes, such as cytochrome oxidase or sod  <cit> , also catalyse the generation of reactive hydroxyl radicals that cause cellular damage  <cit> . on the other hand, iron is required for some enzymes involved in ros detoxification  or in sensing oxidative stress . thus, iron limitation interferes with the oxidative stress response. iron limitation in photosynthetic organisms, such as anabaena sp. strain pcc  <dig>  synechocystis sp. strain pcc  <dig> or r. sphaeroides, resulted in a 2- to 10-fold increase in ros levels compared with those found in cells grown with appropriate iron supplementation  <cit> . however, when non-photosynthetic escherichia coli or bacillus subtilis cells were iron starved, they did not exhibit a significant increase in the ros levels  <cit> . therefore, latifi et al. proposed in  <dig> that oxidative damage induced by iron starvation could be a characteristic of photosynthetic organisms. however, life in the presence of oxygen requires a strict regulation of iron metabolism in all organisms.

the oxidative stress response in e. coli mainly relies on the genes of the oxyr and soxrs regulons  <cit> . a salmonella oxyr deletion mutant was discovered to be hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide   <cit> . furthermore, the oxyr protein positively regulates the expression of the ferric uptake regulator fur gene in response to h2o2  <cit> . in e. coli and in many other bacteria, the fur protein is the main regulator of iron-dependent gene expression . this pattern of gene expression constitutes a regulatory link between oxidative stress responses and iron homeostasis. due to increased fur levels during h2o <dig> stress, fe binding and iron storage is induced, leading to reduced free iron levels, which in turn help bacteria to cope with oxidative stress  <cit> .

experimental data and bioinformatic analyses suggest that in α-proteobacteria, iron regulation mainly occurs via regulators other than fur  <cit> , and nothing is known regarding the regulatory link between iron metabolism and defence against oxidative stress. r. sphaeroides is a facultative photosynthetic bacterium, which performs aerobic respiration in the presence of oxygen. in anoxic conditions in the light, anoxygenic photosynthesis generates atp, while in the dark and in the presence of an electron acceptor, such as dimethyl sulphoxide , anaerobic respiration can be performed. an earlier transcriptome study revealed that many of the genes involved in iron metabolism are induced in response to h2o <dig>  demonstrating a strong correlation between oxidative stress responses and iron metabolism in this bacterium  <cit> . several of these regulated genes are controlled by the intensively studied oxyr regulator  <cit> . transcriptome studies also identified genes affected by iron limitation in r. sphaeroides and revealed that the fur-related proteins fur/mur and irr have no major function in activating gene expression in response to iron limitation  <cit> . the goal of this study is to discriminate between direct effects of iron limitation on gene expression and indirect effects, which are caused by the oxidative stress that occurs due to iron depletion  <cit> . towards this end, the effects of iron limitation on global gene expression in anoxic conditions and oxic conditions were compared. although there was a strong correlation between the two data sets, a number of genes exclusively responded to iron-limiting conditions in the presence of oxygen, while others responded only under anoxic conditions. furthermore, we provide evidence for an important role of oxyr in iron-dependent activation of genes under oxic growth conditions.

RESULTS
a subset of genes responds to iron limitation independently of oxygen availability
only few global gene expression studies of iron limitation performed in oxic conditions simultaneously examined gene expression under iron-limiting, anoxic conditions . in order to discriminate the effects on gene expression that are a direct consequence of iron limitation from those caused by increased ros levels due to iron limitation  <cit> , we analysed r. sphaeroides transcriptomes in both oxic  and anoxic conditions . to generate iron limitation, cultures were grown without external iron in the presence of the iron chelator  <dig> ′-dipyridyl . the high metabolic versatility of r. sphaeroides allows such comparative studies, as it is capable to grow by both aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration .

total rna from three independent control cultures  and three independent iron-limiting cultures was isolated, pooled and used for rnaseq analysis. we normalised the data using reademption  <cit>  with default parameters using segemehl version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  for the read alignment . further differential gene expression analysis was performed with deseq  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  only considering genes that show in at least one of the conditions a rpkm  <cit>  value of ≥  <dig> . relative changes in rna levels from iron-depleted cells compared with control cells were calculated and considered to be regulated in case of a log <dig> fold change of >  <dig> or < - <dig> . since only one sequencing run was performed, statistical evaluation of this dataset was limited. we therefore validated our results by microarray analyses. for this approach the rna of three independent experiments of control and iron-limiting cultures was pooled and hybridised to one array. transcriptome profiles were analysed on two arrays including six biological replicates and confirmed the changes observed by rnaseq, for most genes . however, for most genes, fold changes as determined by rnaseq were distinctly higher than those determined by microarray analysis due to the lower sensitivity of the latter method. for several strongly regulated genes, a quantification of transcript levels was performed by real-time rt-pcr and confirmed the higher fold changes determined by rnaseq . therefore, we mainly referred to the rnaseq data for our comparative analysis.table  <dig>

figure  <dig> displays the comparison of log <dig> ratios between the iron-depleted and control cultures under oxic and anoxic conditions from the rnaseq datasets for all of the  <dig> protein-coding genes that show in at least one of the conditions a rpkm  <cit>  value of > = <dig> . we considered those genes showing a fold change in response to iron regulation of log2 <  <dig> and > - <dig> as not being regulated by iron. these  <dig> non-iron-regulated genes are represented by the grey spots in the middle square of figure 1a. we considered the  <dig> genes showing expression changes of log2 <  <dig> or > - <dig> as being regulated by iron. of these  <dig> iron-regulated genes,  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> were repressed and  <dig> were induced, showed similar responses to iron limitation independent of oxygen availability . these genes are represented by green spots . the oxygen-independent iron-regulated genes have diverse functions: most of the genes encode hypothetical proteins, transcriptional regulators or abc transporters; several genes function in motility and chemotaxis, encode ribosomal proteins or components of dehydrogenases. six of these genes are predicted to have functions related to iron metabolism: bfr encodes a bacterioferritin; rsp_ <dig> and rsp_ <dig> encode tonb-dependent iron siderophore receptors; and rsp_ <dig>  rsp_ <dig> and rsp_ <dig> encode the abc fe siderophore transporter. this expression pattern indicates that these genes directly respond to iron limitation and not to a change in ros levels. in previous studies, we showed that only  <dig> of these  <dig> genes responded to 1o <dig> stress conditions, whereas  <dig> of the genes responded to h2o <dig> stress conditions  <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> of the genes were expressed in an irr-dependent manner, while  <dig> of the genes showed an opposite expression pattern in a strain lacking the fur ortholog fur/mur   <cit> 
. thus, the previously studied iron regulators of alpha-proteobacteria fur/mur and irr have no major involvement in the ros-independent regulation of iron-responsive genes. the regulators involved in this “core iron response” still await identification.figure  <dig>

genes with oxygen-dependent responses to iron limitation show different distinct expression patterns
for the majority of the  <dig> iron-regulated protein-coding genes , the response to iron was dependent on oxygen availability. because these genes showed distinct expression patterns, we assigned them to different clusters for further analysis and discussion. figure 1b depicts these different clusters of genes, omitting all genes that are not regulated by iron or that show an oxygen-independent response to iron limitation .

one hundred eighty-four genes with a stronger down-regulation in response to iron limitation in oxic conditions than in anoxic conditions are grouped in cluster i . most of these genes have a function in chemotaxis and motility . it was shown previously that these genes are also down-regulated in response to oxidative stress in r. sphaeroides  <cit> , indicating that these genes are likely repressed by ros in particular. an effect of iron on the expression of motility genes was also observed in helicobacter pylori  <cit> , vibrio cholerae  <cit>  and pseudomonas fluorescens  <cit> . cluster i includes also most genes for the synthesis of pigment-binding proteins . several genes of the nuo operon encoding subunits of the nadh dehydrogenase complex are also part of cluster i. this enzymatic complex comprises iron sulphur clusters. repression under oxic conditions when the amount of iron cofactor is limited therefore reduces the production of these proteins and may also reduce the production of further ros. under anoxic conditions, the expression of nuo genes is very low, and no additional repression by iron limitation is necessary. the rnaseq data for these experiments are publicly available through the ncbi’s geo database .

cluster ii  consists of  <dig> genes that show an expression change in response to iron limitation of log2 < - <dig> in oxic conditions and log2 >  <dig> in anoxic conditions. most of these genes function in the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll , the synthesis of heme and bacteriochlorophyll precursors , or the synthesis of carotenoids . because bacteriochlorophyll synthesis and energy conversion in the reaction centre require iron  <cit> , a repression of genes that function in photosynthesis in response to iron limitation is meaningful. however, the exclusive repression under oxic conditions indicates that the repression is a response to the elevated ros levels that occur due to iron limitation. this result is in agreement with the repressing effect of oxidative stress and photooxidative stress on these genes  <cit> .

cluster iii includes  <dig> genes  that exhibit stronger upregulation in response to iron limitation in oxic conditions than in anoxic conditions. many genes with predicted functions in ferric iron uptake and storage are among this cluster, including exbbd and tonb, rsp_1438- <dig> encoding a ferrichrome transporter, bfd encoding a bacterioferritin, irpa encoding an iron-regulated protein, genes encoding fe3+-siderophore transporters and hemp encoding an iron uptake protein. an induction of genes for ferric iron uptake and transport under iron-limitation conditions helps to counteract the iron limitation. under anoxic conditions, iron is mostly present as ferrous iron, and a strong upregulation of these genes would not be appropriate.

cluster iv comprises  <dig> genes  that are exclusively or much more strongly upregulated in anoxic iron-limiting conditions. among these genes, we found the ferrous transport system feoab, several genes involved in cysteine and sulphur metabolism, including rsp_1944- <dig>  and cysk, cysaptw, and metniq  and genes with other functions, such as rsp_ <dig> encoding a flavoprotein, rsp_2890- <dig> encoding a copper transport protein and cuer, a regulator of rsp_2890- <dig>  <cit> . an upregulation of the ferrous transport system feoab and other metal transport systems would help to counteract iron limitation under anoxic conditions.

cluster v includes  <dig> genes  with an exclusive or much stronger repression in response to iron limitation under anoxic conditions compared with oxic conditions, and these genes have very diverse functions. two of the genes, groes and groel, have a role in the heat shock response,  <dig> of the genes encode ribosomal proteins,  <dig> of the genes encode transporters and  <dig> of the genes encode putative transcriptional regulators. in addition, genes for hydrogenase production and regulation  fall into this cluster. the iron-containing hydrogenases might be non-essential, and their down-regulation upon iron limitation would therefore free up trace amounts of iron for more crucial proteins. genes for hydrogenase production and regulation are only weakly expressed in oxic conditions, and no further repression under iron-limitation conditions is required .

remarkably,  <dig> genes  grouped in cluster vi showed opposite responses to iron limitation in the presence or in the absence of oxygen. under iron depletion, most genes of the isc-suf operon for iron-sulphur cluster assembly were induced in an oxic environment but repressed under anoxic conditions. an increase of the suf machinery to enable iron-sulphur cluster assembly under low iron concentrations is understandable. the demand for repair of damaged iron-sulphur clusters is higher under oxic conditions, as elevated ros levels destabilise fe-s clusters. hence, it is not surprising that these genes were also upregulated in the presence of h2o <dig> stress  <cit> . in anoxic conditions, fe-s clusters remain stable; consequently, the isc-suf operon is repressed. however, several metal transporters, such as moda and modd for molybdate transport or rsp_2890- <dig> for copper transport, are exclusively induced in anoxic conditions, while genes coding for sulphate/thiosulphate transporters  or methionine uptake transporters  are more strongly induced compared with oxic conditions. we presume that in iron-limiting anoxic conditions, a change in the demand for cofactors takes place and iron is partly replaced by other metals.

role of the oxyr protein in the response of r. sphaeroidesto iron limitation in oxic and anoxic conditions
a response of many iron homeostasis genes, including sufbcd, bfd-bfr or exbbd-tonb, to h2o <dig> exposure in r. sphaeroides was previously observed, and an influence of the oxyr protein was revealed for most of these genes  <cit> . to elucidate the role of oxyr in iron-starved cells, we compared log <dig> ratios in response to iron limitation using real-time rt-pcr for the wild type strain and a strain lacking oxyr  due to a chromosomal deletion  <cit> . we selected those genes that showed a strong regulation in the rnaseq or microarray analyses . genes from all six clusters were selected to test for a potential cluster specificity of oxyr.

the stronger induction in response to iron starvation in oxic conditions of cluster iii genes, namely exbbd, tonb, bfd, irpa, afua, hemp and rsp_ <dig> , revealed by rnaseq analysis was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr . however, the induction in oxic conditions was significantly reduced in the oxyr deletion strain, while the oxyr deletion had no significant effect under anoxic conditions. a similar expression pattern was observed for cluster vi genes, represented by genes of the isc-suf operon, the sitabcd operon  and znuc  . induction of these genes in response to iron limitation under oxic conditions was significantly dependent on oxyr.

oxyr-dependent upregulation of cluster iii and cluster vi genes may prevent a stronger oxidative stress; e.g., by removing free iron , removing oxygen  or upregulating the oxidative stress response . our data provide the first clue regarding a regulatory link between iron metabolism and oxidative stress defence in an alpha-proteobacterium: oxyr, which is activated by oxidative stress and consequently affects the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response, also activates genes important for iron metabolism in oxic conditions with iron limitation.

the fact that most cluster iii genes showed some activation under oxic iron-limiting conditions in the oxyr mutant implies that factors other than oxyr are responsible for maximal induction. these factors may also trigger the observed activation of cluster iii genes under anoxic conditions, which was independent of oxyr.

while all of the tested genes for ferric iron transporter systems  were regulated in an oxyr-dependent manner, the ferrous transport system feoab and other cluster iv genes were not influenced by oxyr . the same result holds true for the remaining clusters i, ii and v. the only exception was the groel operon ; however, the cluster v expression pattern was not confirmed by real-time rt-pcr analysis.

the possibility that the expression discrepancies in the background of ∆oxyr between oxic and anoxic conditions were dmso dependent can be excluded. we compared transcript level of wild type and ∆oxyr cultures grown in oxic conditions in presence or absence of dmso. no significant changes could be observed due to dmso addition  .

in a previous study, we reported that a consensus sequence for the dna binding site of oxyr does not exist in rhodobacter  <cit> . only the pattern tn11a, defining the minimum binding site for lysr-type regulators, was present in the majority of oxyr binding regions. in an effort to obtain more detailed information about the promoter specificity of the genes in the six clusters, we used the meme program  to identify conserved, overrepresented dna motifs in the upstream promoter region of the selected genes  <cit> . as the search did not reveal clear dna motifs for an individual cluster, we assume that several transcription factors are responsible for the differential expression or that the consensus for the binding sequence is very weak, as in the case of oxyr.

iron starvation impairs growth of strain  <dig> .1oxyrin oxic, but not in anoxic, conditions
based on the findings that many genes with a role in iron homeostasis were expressed in an oxyr-dependent manner only in oxic conditions, we assumed that iron deprivation along with oxic conditions would lead to impaired growth of an oxyr deletion strain. a growth defect under iron limitation was previously observed for a pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig> strain, which lacks oxyr  <cit> . we therefore monitored the growth of the oxyr deletion strain  <dig> .1oxyr under normal growth conditions and under iron starvation in oxic or anoxic conditions and compared it with that of the parental wild type strain. during the exponential phase in oxic conditions, the wild type and oxyr deletion mutant showed similar doubling times, regardless of iron availability . in the presence of iron, both strains reached a comparable end-od . however, under iron limitation in oxic conditions, the mutant showed a significantly lower end-od , indicating an important role of oxyr under these conditions.table  <dig>

doubling times were calculated for exponentially grown r. sphaeroides cultures in the presence and absence  of iron in oxic or anoxic conditions. doubling times are presented in hours  and represent the mean of at least three independent growth experiments.
growth curves and ros level measurements. characterisation of wild type r. sphaeroides  and the  <dig> .1∆oxyr mutant  was performed in oxic conditions in the presence  or absence  of iron. the optical density at 660 nm  was determined over time, and growth is indicated as continuous line. the intracellular levels of ros  are presented in arbitrary units. both data sets represent the mean of at least three independent experiments, and the error bars indicate the standard deviation.



because some proteins involved in the oxidative stress response require iron, iron limitation also interferes with the oxidative stress defence. we therefore monitored ros levels at different growth stages by fluorescence measurements taken after adding 10 mm  <dig> -dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate  to the cultures. the presence of such ros as h2o <dig> or hydroxyl radicals leads to elevated levels of relative dcfh-da fluorescence . as a positive control, the wild type was stressed with the superoxide-generating paraquat for 3 hours at a final concentration of 250 μm, resulting in a 3-fold increase in ros levels compared with the non-stressed control cultures. as previously described, exposure to oxygen and to iron starvation caused a strongly increased ros accumulation in the wild type cells   <cit> . the transcriptional regulator oxyr is a known key regulator of the response to hydrogen peroxide and induces the expression of antioxidant activities  <cit> . in the presence of iron, ros levels in the oxyr deletion strain were only slightly elevated compared to those in the wild type strain at late growth stage. under iron limitation, a clear increase in ros levels in the oxyr deletion strain was observed at all tested growth stages.figure  <dig>

mutant. cultures were grown under normal iron  and iron-limiting  conditions in oxic and anoxic  environments. ros generated by the cells were analysed after reaction with 10 mm  <dig> -dcfh-da. cells incubated with 250 μm paraquat  served as a positive control. the autofluorescence of cells without dye was subtracted from the measured values. the fluorescence intensity was normalised to the optical densities of the samples. the resulting values are presented in arbitrary units. the data represent the mean of three independent experiments, and the error bars indicate the standard deviation.



our data suggest that the elevated ros levels under iron limitation in oxic conditions  increased the level of oxidised oxyr and consequently led to the activation of oxyr-dependent genes. the increased kate level under oxic iron limiting conditions  is in agreement with this assumption. kate activation under oxidative stress strictly depends on oxyr.

furthermore, a strain lacking the oxyr gene showed significantly reduced doubling times and a lower end-od than the parental strain in anoxic conditions irrespective of iron availability . this result is in agreement with our transcript level analysis, where oxyr has nearly no notable influence on the anoxic response to iron limitation . the possibility that the growth phenotypes were due to toxicity of the alternative electron acceptor  can be excluded, as cultures grown in oxic conditions with dmso did not exhibit impaired growth . up to now, we cannot ascribe a role to oxyr in an anoxic environment. nevertheless, our observations indicate an important role for oxyr, even in the absence of molecular oxygen or ros.

CONCLUSIONS
iron limitation increases ros levels in r. sphaeroides . to discriminate the effects on gene expression that are a direct consequence of iron limitation from the effects caused by the increased ros levels under iron limitation, we compared gene expression under iron limiting conditions in the presence and absence of oxygen in r. sphaeroides. of all the genes responding to iron limitation, almost one third showed the same response in the presence and absence of oxygen, implying that these genes exhibited an iron-specific response. apparently, a link between iron availability and oxidative stress exists only for a subset of iron-dependently regulated genes.

the other two thirds of the iron-regulated genes showed diverse expression patterns that were influenced by oxygen availability, and the known regulator oxyr was identified as an important factor for induction of many genes involved in iron metabolism under oxic conditions. for those genes, elevated ros levels were the trigger of the response rather than iron limitation itself. the oxyr regulator provides a link between the responses to oxidative stress and iron. in the future, additional regulators that are responsible for oxyr-independent activation in oxic conditions, activation in anoxic conditions and repression in response to iron limitation will need to be identified.
