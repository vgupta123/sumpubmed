BACKGROUND
the direct and indirect influences of human activities has caused drastic changes in the genetic composition of many wild populations. decline and fragmentation of formerly continuous populations into isolated local populations raise several genetic concerns, such as the loss of genetic variation and its associated effects on local effective population sizes . increase of inbreeding in small populations can ultimately lead to lower evolutionary potential and elevated extinction risk  <cit> . small population size may also increase the risk of hybridization when the probability of finding a mate of the same species is limited  <cit> . populations of highly mobile species are expected to be less prone to negative genetic effects because individuals can disperse and exchange genes across large geographic areas. wolves are known for their great adaptability  <cit>  and high dispersal capability . consequently, gene flow and genetic similarity between adjacent wolf populations could be expected, and large neighbouring populations may provide a buffer against loss of variation in smaller populations  <cit> .

the grey wolf  is one of the most controversial animals, and has been an object of intense eradication campaigns throughout western europe  <cit>  and north america  <cit>  since the 18th century. by the end of the 19th century, most of the western european wolf populations were extirpated  <cit> , or at least driven into isolated and fragmented habitat patches  <cit> . also in eastern europe, rather extensive predator removal programmes were implemented from the 1800s onwards with a negative impact on the wolf population  <cit> . after wwii, alterations in forestry practices have also had large effects on wolf population sizes via their impact on the abundance of the most important prey species of wolves, moose  <cit> . genetic studies reveal recent fragmentation in the eastern european wolf population resulting in relatively small  effective population sizes  <cit> , significant genetic differentiation and low migration rates between regions  <cit> . the historical effects of fragmentation on reductions in population size and loss of genetic variation is currently unknown.

it has been estimated that in finland alone,  <dig>  <dig> wolves were killed during the last ~150 years . before the active persecution started around the 1850s, the wolf was distributed throughout the whole finland. due to intense hunting wolves quickly disappeared from the western and central parts of the country  <cit> . located on the fringe of a large russian wolf population , the finnish population did not presumably disappear altogether, but experienced several consecutive bottlenecks. for example, in the 1920s and 1970s, the wolf population consisted of a few individuals  <cit> . it has been suggested that the whole population was extirpated in the 1920s because of a distemper epidemic  <cit> . in  <dig>  the wolf became protected in finland outside the northern reindeer management area. until the 1990s, the population size was mostly regulated by the amount of incoming immigration from the source population in north-western russia  <cit> . however, when wolves started to regularly reproduce in finland after the middle 1990s, the finnish population became somewhat genetically differentiated from the russian one  <cit> , and the finnish population numbers did not any more reflect the abundance variation of the russian population  <cit> .

the use of museum collections in population genetics studies may provide a valuable historical perspective for the conservation and management of present-day populations. specimens in museum collections often provide information on genetic diversity prior to population declines in response to anthropogenic effects  <cit> , and therefore provide a baseline against which to evaluate the current genetic status of the species. historical samples have been successfully used in many genetic studies since the early 1990s , commonly investigating the genetic consequences of different anthropogenic factors, such as overexploitation  <cit> , habitat fragmentation  <cit>  or even direct persecution  <cit>  on the genetic diversity and structure of populations.

in the present study, we used dna extracted from wolf samples obtained from zoological museums to examine historical patterns of genetic variability and structure in the finnish wolf population, which experienced a dramatic population decline over a ~150 year period. we were further interested to see the possible stabilizing effect of gene flow from the neighbouring, large eastern population, i.e. could gene flow from russian population have been large enough to prevent negative consequences  associated with population decline.

RESULTS
dna extraction and amplification
a total of  <dig> samples  were extracted and  <dig>  were successfully amplified with mitochondrial primers and  <dig>  with at least  <dig> of  <dig> microsatellite loci. amplification success varied between the temporal groups and sample types . in agreement with previous studies, the success rate was higher for mtdna than for microsatellites, bone samples amplified on average better than the pelt samples  <cit> , and tissue samples from dental cavities were a very good source of usable dna  <cit> .

we did not observe a significant correlation between the microsatellite amplicon length  and error rates . on the other hand, amplification success was greatly reduced on loci with long allele sizes . microchecker  <cit>  analysis did not suggest any scoring errors due to stuttering or large allelic drop outs in any of the temporal groups. null alleles were possibly present in locus cph <dig> in the population sampled in 1980– <dig> with  <dig> observed homozygotes compared to expected  <dig> . because null alleles at this locus were not detected in the other temporal groups, the locus was included in further analyses.

ten samples were discarded from the data set prior to genetic analyses. of these ten, eight were discarded due to close relatedness  indicated by their genotypes. two samples had identical genotypes and collection information, and one of them was discarded. additionally, one mitochondrial sequence was not included in further analysis due to a repeatedly amplified double peak in two nucleotide positions, possibly due to post-mortem c → t deamination  <cit> . in the first temporal group   <dig> mtdna sequences and  <dig> microsatellite genotypes were analysed, in the second   <dig> of both types, in the third   <dig> and  <dig>  and in the fourth   <dig> and  <dig> 

mitochondrial sequence analyses
mtdna variation and genetic differentiation between temporal groups
a total of  <dig> nucleotide positions were found to be polymorphic within the amplified 431 bp long mtdna sequences yielding eight distinct haplotypes . the three most common haplotypes  in historical wolves were the ones present also in the current wolf population  <cit> . these haplotypes were present in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> historical wolves . the remaining five haplotypes were rare and found only in one  or two  samples.

mitochondrial diversity measured as number of haplotypes and number of polymorphic sites was highest  at the beginning of the sampling period  despite smaller sample sizes. other haplotype diversity estimates followed the same pattern and were clearly or slightly higher in samples collected before  <dig> . genetic differentiation based on haplotype frequencies  was large  and highly significant  between the first  and all other temporal groups , but not in other pairwise comparisons. three main haplotypes  were found in all except the small second group , in which four individuals carried the haplotype ow <dig> and other two had unique haplotypes . the large difference between the first and other groups was mostly due to the shift between the two dominating haplotypes; in the first group  <dig> of the  <dig> individuals  had the ow <dig> haplotype and only one ow <dig> , whereas among wolves collected after  <dig> abundances were reversed. in 1960– <dig> ten individuals of  <dig>  had haplotype ow <dig> and  <dig>  ow <dig>  and in 1980– <dig> the proportions  were 4/ <dig>  and 21/ <dig> .

mtdna population bottleneck tests
neutrality tests suggested significant demographic changes in the wolf population at the end of the historical sampling period . the two neutrality tests were significant in temporal groups collected in 1960– <dig> , whereas for the group collected in 1980– <dig>  fu’s test value fs was significant , but tajima’s d showed a decreasing trend .

european-wide mtdna phylogeny
the overall dataset including our  <dig> historical samples consisted of  <dig> sequences with the mtdna sequence length of 287 bp. in total,  <dig> different haplotypes among european wolves were detected .

two historical wolf haplotypes that are also found in the contemporary finnish population  were merged into a single one when sequences were truncated. the remaining seven historical haplotypes comprised one that was unique and six haplotypes that have previously been reported from other parts of europe. interestingly, the still-existing finnish wolf haplotypes  have mainly been found in nearby countries , whereas those historical haplotypes that have vanished from the modern finnish population, seem to have a much wider geographical distribution .

microsatellite analyses
hw-equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium between loci
the oldest  and the latest  temporal groups deviated significantly from hw-equilibrium with several loci showing heterozygosity deficiency , whereas the historical temporal groups 1920– <dig>  1960– <dig>  and the modern reference sample  were in hw-equilibrium. none of the  <dig> loci showed a constant pattern of deviation . significant linkage disequilibrium  between loci was detected in  <dig> of the  <dig> pairwise comparisons in samples collected prior to  <dig>  2/ <dig> in 1920– <dig>  2/ <dig> in 1960– <dig>  3/ <dig> in 1980– <dig> and 1/ <dig> in 1995– <dig> 

amount of genetic variation and inbreeding coefficient
we found no significant differences in the amount of expected or observed heterozygosity among the temporal groups, and there was no evidence of inbreeding . allelic richness estimates were also rather similar throughout the study period, whereas private allelic richness was clearly higher in samples collected prior to  <dig> . when we compared diversity indices  of samples collected before and after  <dig> using the randomization test, no notable differences between the groups were found except for a slightly higher  allelic richness in the older group .

ghost alleles
one hundred and seven alleles were found among all samples with the  <dig> microsatellite loci used . twenty-one alleles  present in historical wolves were not found from much larger modern reference sample , whereas only four  alleles were unique to the present wolf population. of these  <dig> historical alleles, nine  were only found from samples prior to  <dig>  and four  from samples collected in 1960– <dig> . because the sampling of present-day wolf population is rather comprehensive , it is legitimate to presume, that these alleles have vanished from the modern finnish wolf population, and represent true ‘ghost alleles’ and that suggest a more diverse historical population. besides high occurrence of alleles unique to museum samples, we detected large frequency shifts in many alleles  indicating genetic drift.

genetic differentiation
the genetic composition of the finnish wolf population clearly changed over time. genetic differentiation between the temporal groups was small or moderate , but statistically significant in all cases. the pairwise genetic distances  between the temporal groups were significantly correlated with the elapsed time . relationship between the genetic and temporal distances was linear suggesting that the change in the population gene pool can be described as a gradual change. according to amova, ~ <dig> % of the total genetic variation was detected among the temporal groups and ~ <dig> % within the groups .

the two-dimensional fca-plot of the distribution of genetic variation between wolves  also suggested a gradual change in the population. largest distance was seen between the oldest  and modern-day wolves . observed means and variances of distribution patterns differed significantly between the temporal groups along both fca-axes indicating that historical wolves were genetically different compared to present-day wolves. much higher standard deviations of the fca-scores among the oldest compared to present-day samples showed that the distribution of genetic variation has been much wider historically. statistical tests for the distribution patterns are given in additional file 6: text s <dig> 

the assignment analysis showed varying degree of genetic similarity among the museum groups . all individuals were assigned with the highest probability to their own temporal group. interestingly, the probabilities of sample assignments to other than their own temporal group varied greatly. especially, the proportion of assignments into the first temporal group  was low  among the individuals of the subsequent groups indicating relatively large genetic changes between the first and following time periods. the wolves in the other temporal groups had also rather small mean probabilities  to belong to the second temporal group suggesting rather unique composition of this group. on the other hand, mean assignment probability of wolves in the second temporal group to the latter groups were quite high suggesting that in the subsequent periods there were still substantial amount of genetic variation which was present in the second temporal group. samples collected after  <dig> showed much more admixture and the mean assignment probabilities of the wolves to other than their own or first temporal group were  <dig> – <dig> .

genetic differentiation between the current karelian wolf population  and the oldest temporal group of the finnish wolves  was significant, but smaller  than any of the estimates between the oldest and other temporal finnish groups . this suggests that historical genetic variation might be better preserved in the neighbouring large russian population. however, the inspection of the distribution of variation  revealed a very similar pattern to that seen among the finnish wolves . there was very little overlap between these two groups and the current karelian distribution is more compact than the scores of the historical finnish wolf population.

hidden population structure
structure analysis revealed hidden spatial and temporal population structure within the historical finnish wolf population. according to the ad hoc quantity ∆k  <cit> , the most likely number of clusters was three .  <dig> % of the individuals were inferred to these clusters with an assignment level of at least  <dig> , and for over a half of samples , the level was over  <dig>  . the contribution of the three inferred clusters to the genetic composition in different temporal groups was highly concordant between different runs , and indicated change in genetic structure over time. especially the first group  showed a very distinct composition compared to later time periods: half of the samples  belonged to a cluster with very little admixture with the other two clusters , and only two wolves were inferred to this group afterwards . interestingly, all of these wolves were sampled from northern finland . additionally, wolves belonging to another genetic subgroup  were common in samples from  <dig> onwards and most common among the modern-day reference samples , but were almost absent in the first temporal group.

demographic changes
bottleneck tests based on the heterozygosity excess method did not indicate severe preceding bottlenecks in any of the temporal groups or in the modern-day reference sample. l-shaped allelic frequency distribution typical to non-bottlenecked populations  was observed and one-tailed wilcoxon tests for the heterozygosity excess gave a p value of >  <dig>  in all except the second temporal group , which was too small for reliable testing . even though alleles frequency distribution was l-shaped in all groups, the proportion of rare alleles  was lower in the first two temporal groups  than in following samples , and as a consequence, the distribution more shallow.

m-ratio tests revealed high average m-ratios across the temporal groups . comparison of observed ratios against simulated mutation-drift equilibrium expectations showed, however, that unless the proportion of non-single-step mutations is high  and/or the effective size of the population large , the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck in the first temporal sample was supported. under the evolutionary scenarios investigated, bottlenecks for other temporal groups are supported only if the mutation model follows a strict step-wise mutation model  or the proportion of larger than single-step mutations is at most ~10%.

effective population size
both ne estimates with single-sample methods for the wolves prior to  <dig> were very small: ld-ne =  <dig>   and  <dig>   with onesamp method. onesamp approach provided consistently lower ne estimates compared to the method based on linkage disequilibrium for other temporal groups as well . confidence limits of the two estimates were not overlapping for samples in 1960– <dig>  and for the present-day reference population  suggesting a significant difference between them.

temporal estimates from the historical data  suggested a ne ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  . incorporation of modern wolf samples after the population recovery in  <dig> extended our sampling interval with additional five generations, but did not significantly change the magnitude of the estimates of any of the used methods. although there was an over 2-fold difference between the smallest and largest estimate of ne on the museum sampling interval, confidence intervals were rather wide and overlapping, and estimates hence not significantly different.

discussion
genetic analyses of dna extracted from museum specimens allowed us to directly assess the patterns of genetic variation and structure in the historical finnish wolf population. demographic changes due to recent anthropogenic perturbations of wild population are often so large, that the use of present-day data solely to reconstruct the population history could be misleading  <cit> . considering the hunting statistics as a proxy for wolf abundance, the largest reduction appears to have occurred prior the 20th century . although we lack a sufficient sampling of this time period, we were able to detect intriguing changes in the genetic composition of the finnish wolf population during the last ~150 years.

loss of genetic diversity is assumed in conjunction with strong population size decline if gene flow is insufficient to prevent local genetic drift  <cit> . our results confirmed gradual genetic change  and accompanying increase in genetic differentiation  within the finnish wolf population over time. the most drastic genetic changes were the disappearance of alleles  and haplotypes . almost 20% of microsatellite alleles present in the historical finnish wolf population have not been found in a comprehensive analyses of the modern population , and only three  mitochondrial haplotype lineages  <cit>  out of eight found in this study have remained .

compared to the eastern european wolf populations, which were probably less affected during the historical wolf persecution than the western populations , the number of mitochondrial haplotypes was of the same order or even higher in our oldest temporal group: in the finnish wolf samples collected prior to  <dig>   <dig> haplotypes were found among  <dig> samples , whereas sastre et al.  <cit>  discovered  <dig> haplotypes among  <dig> individuals in the european part of russia and randi et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> haplotypes among  <dig> individuals in the bulgarian population. in total,  <dig> haplotypes were detected among the present-day european mtdna wolf sequences together with the historical haplotypes from this study . one of the historical finnish haplotypes was unique, which suggest that some variation might be lost even on a larger geographic scale. moreover, haplotypes lost from the modern finnish wolf population but still found elsewhere in europe, show much wider geographic distribution than the extant haplotypes. this observation is consistent with the substantial decline in and large-scale fragmentation of the european wolf population.

examination of the distribution pattern of historical microsatellite variation also revealed significantly larger genetic variation among the oldest wolf samples  and a gradual temporal shift in the finnish wolf gene pool . in the fca-plot only a few wolves in the oldest group  were within the range of the modern wolf population . similar pattern of distribution was observed between the modern-day karelian wolves and the oldest historical wolves  indicating that some of the past variation has likely been lost in the neighbouring areas as well. the assignment analysis  showed a very small probability of admixture  of the oldest finnish temporal sample with subsequent groups referring also to notable changes in the population gene pool. population bottleneck tests suggested early ne decline  and also for historical wolves collected after  <dig> . even though it is likely that the finnish wolf population underwent heavy local population declines in the 1920s and 1970s  <cit> , our results indicate that the largest genetic changes are probably of older origin, and connected to the assumed abrupt population decline in the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries .

early genetic change was further supported by clustering analysis: three genetic clusters  among historical finnish wolves were found, of which one was almost exclusive to oldest samples, and all of the individuals assigned to this cluster were from northern finland . interestingly, in a similar historical case study from neighbouring scandinavian wolf population  <cit> , genetic differentiation between the northern and southern wolves was also reported. though we cannot be certain that the historical wolves typical to scandinavia were similar to the finnish ones, it is possible that some historical variation typical to northern fennoscandia has been lost. northern finland and scandinavia are traditional semidomestic reindeer management areas, where tolerance of wolves is low  <cit> . the efficient removal of wolves from these areas not only decreases the possibility of migration towards scandinavia today  <cit> , but might have caused the detected loss of genetic variation during historical times.

unlike in flagstad et al.  <cit>  – in which a ~30% decrease in heterozygosity besides a 40% reduction of allelic diversity was reported due to population decline – the amount of genetic diversity measured by means of heterozygosity did not significantly change in the finnish wolf population during the study period . however, heterozygosity is relatively insensitive to the effects of short bottlenecks, and even in the most extreme case, when only a single breeding pair would survive, 75% of the genetic heterozygosity remains in the next generation  <cit> . moreover, population growth after the bottleneck and especially gene flow to post-bottlenecked population from another population can effectively counteract the  loss of heterozygosity  <cit> . for example, nyström et al.  <cit>  showed that as a result of a severe demographic bottleneck in the early 20th century, the scandinavian arctic fox population lost about 25% of its microsatellite alleles and four of seven mtdna haplotypes, whereas the level of heterozygosity did not significantly change most probably due to gene flow from russia. immigration from russia may also have been sufficient to prevent the loss of heterozygosity and local extinction, but not to completely restrain the loss of alleles and haplotypes in the finnish wolf population. it is also possible that heterozygosity indeed decreased in the finnish wolf population during the largest demographic bottleneck in the late 19th and early 20th century , but because of the very limited amount of samples of that period, we are unable to confirm this hypothesis.

current genetic methods detecting bottlenecks from single population samples are all based on detecting deviations from expectations under mutation-drift equilibrium, and contrast two different diversity indices, of which one is more affected by genetic drift than another  <cit> . regardless of the fact that the proportion of rare alleles was ~15–45% lower in samples collected before  <dig> than in later samples, the heterozygosity method failed to indicate bottlenecks in the historical finnish wolf population . in cases with severe, long-lasting bottlenecks together with preceding large population size – which is the likely scenario for the finnish wolves  – genetic bottlenecks are more likely to be correctly detected with the m-ratio test  <cit> . the observed m-ratios were high in all temporal groups  and well above the often used critical value of  <dig>  typical to putatively stable wild populations  <cit> . simulated mutation-drift expectation values for the first temporal sample  were much higher than this critical value in equilibrium under the most realistic evolutionary scenarios  supporting a preceding bottleneck. it is possible that the typical m-ratios in some wild populations are clearly higher , which highlights the importance of estimating m-ratio values over a varying range of parameter values when the mutation model and ne are not known in detail  <cit> .

mitochondrial sequences have only ¼ of the ne compared to autosomal markers and lack recombination. thus they are more prone to genetic drift. contrary to microsatellites showing a likely bottleneck in the earliest temporal period, changes in mitochondrial diversity were more gradual, and a significant signal of demographic change was detected only in temporal groups collected at or after the 1960′s . in conclusion – a genetic bottleneck was likely in the oldest samples based on microsatellite markers, and the population gained a new equilibrium state in later generations. on the other hand, neutrality tests with mtdna suggested continued genetic drift and loss of genetic variation more recently .

our linkage disequilibrium based ne estimates were always larger than those given by the onesamp approach . ld-ne results are likely to more correct, because former studies  <cit>  have shown that varying sample size may lead to biased onesamp estimates, and the number of wolves in our temporal groups was quite limited. the ld-based method has also its limitations. if the linkage disequilibrium between loci is a result of something else than preceding small effective size – including substructure and overlapping generations – ld-based methods may also give biased ne estimates  <cit> . because our temporal samples were collected over an extended period, there were evidently individuals from several wolf generations in each group, but the bias is likely rather similar in different temporal groups. point estimates of ne in the first temporal group  might also have been downward biased because there were two distinctive genetic clusters with very little admixture among samples collected prior to  <dig> .

some assumptions of ne estimation with temporal methods were likely to be violated, and thus those estimates could also be somewhat biased. especially violating the assumptions of no immigration and non-overlapping generations could have biased our results. with overlapping generations temporal methods tend to give a large overestimate  of ne e.g. for large mammals, which have low fecundity and a type i survivorship curve  <cit> . on the other hand, this bias is likely to be greatly alleviated with the long time frame  of the temporal groups  <cit> . the bias caused by immigration, on the other hand, is likely to be large and its effect depends on the allele frequencies in the source population: if immigrants are from genetically similar source population , ne is biased high when immigration reduce the drift signal  <cit> . in that case, depending of the rate of immigration, estimate tends to reflect more the ne of the whole metapopulation and not solely the local ne  <cit> .

our different estimates of the ne in the finnish wolf population during the last ~150 years suggested a historical effective size ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  . with typical ne /nc –ratios of ~ <dig> – <dig>  for wolves  <cit>  this would suggest a mean census population size of at least ~300– <dig> wolves. therefore it is clear, that immigration from the russian population has had an explicit effect on  the finnish wolf population during historical times. on the other hand, a previous study by aspi et al.  <cit>  suggested an even larger ancient effective size of about  <dig> wolves, which started to decline exponentially in the late 19th or early 20th century . the limited amount of samples from this time period in our study  are likely to restrict the power of our analyses, as we may detect only a fraction of the oldest historical genetic signals. compared to our effective population size estimates from the contemporary finnish wolf population  <cit> , however, mean historical effective size of 86– <dig> is relatively high. in general the corresponding estimates from modern population are 50-85% lower  and in concordance with the assumption of very recent genetic isolation from the russian karelian population  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the finnish wolf population has been demographically dependent on the neighbouring russian wolf population for a long time. active persecution of wolves in finland lasted for over 150 years and wolves were, and still are, actively hunted in the nearby areas in russia. long-term anthropogenic pressure has been shown to be able to restrain gene flow between population and cause population fragmentation even in highly mobile species like wolves  <cit> . thus an assumption of genetic homogeneity and constant positive influx from larger source population may not hold, and especially so, if the source population itself is under continuous hunting pressure.

this study provided a long-term historical perspective of the finnish wolf population genetics. connectivity with the much larger russian population was shown to have retained a high amount of nuclear genetic diversity in the small finnish population, and no significant decrease in heterozygosity was detected. however, the majority of historical mitochondrial haplotypes and a high number of autosomal alleles appear to have been lost and a specific northern wolf type has likely disappeared from the present-day gene pool. moreover, effects of genetic drift causing changes in allele frequencies over time was evident, and point estimates of the effective population size in general is rather small and supporting population fragmentation  <cit> . the largest genetic differences were observed between the oldest  and subsequent temporal groups suggesting that the majority of the detected genetic changes were accompanied with the strong population decline at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. the heavy decline was also seen with microsatellite markers as lower than expected m-ratio for samples collected prior  <dig>  without corresponding historical sampling from russia, we are unable to confirm if similar demographic and genetic changes have occurred in the source areas as well. however, because the present-day karelian population also differed notably from the historical finnish samples, it is likely that the detected changes apply to a somewhat larger geographic region.

the present-day finnish wolf population recovered via natural immigration from russia after  <dig> and the population grew rapidly until  <dig>  but then the population quickly declined  <cit> . according to the latest  census estimates by the finnish game and fisheries research institute, there are now only ~140– <dig> wolves in finland and the species is listed as endangered. after the population crash, inbreeding in the population has increased significantly  <cit>  and gene flow between russian karelian and finnish populations seems to be low at present  <cit> . in order to maintain a genetically healthy and viable wolf population in the long-term, it is clear that the population should be larger and/or better connected to the russian population. the historical finnish wolf population was likely much larger, genetically more diverse and more uniform with the russian population than the population today . thus, the ultimate management goal should be to restore this connection. this can probably only be achieved with substantial reduction of the anthropogenic pressure towards wolves still prevailing on both sides of the border.
