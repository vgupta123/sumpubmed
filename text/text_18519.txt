BACKGROUND
social insects constitute complex societies with caste differentiation, and in some cases, they form huge colonies with vast numbers of individuals. the elaborate integration of insect societies has intrigued researchers for many years  <cit> . termites , which flourish in abundance and diversity in tropical and temperate zones and constitute one of the major groups of social insects, also form complex societies that include various castes  <cit> . the majority of social-insect research has focused primarily on hymenopterans . because the social mode and regulatory mechanisms of termites are different from those of hymenopterans in many respects  <cit> , termites can provide an essential source of information for understanding the general and common features of sociality  <cit> .

the morphologies of termite soldiers are highly specialized  <cit>  and their differentiation is regulated through mutual interactions with other nest mates  <cit> . soldiers are typical examples of the combination of exaggerated morphology  <cit>  and polyphenism  <cit> . the regulatory mechanisms of polyphenism have been studied in various aspects and such studies have spurred the development of a new research field that spans the boundary between ecology and developmental biology  <cit> . recently, the molecular biological approach for the study of social insects such as the ant  <cit> , honey bee  <cit>  and termite  <cit> , has become common. little is known, however, about the developmental basis of morphological modifications among polyphenic castes. utilization of the molecular developmental approach with termites, whose caste development involves large morphological modification, has its own advantages and peculiarities  <cit> .

the mode of postembryonic development and caste differentiation varies among termite lineages  <cit> . in the damp-wood termite hodotermopsis sjostedti, the pseudergate  has the potential to develop into one of several castes  <cit>  . although a genetic factor is known to influence caste determination in the termite species reticulitermes speratus  <cit> , in termites in general it is recognized that environmental factors during larval or pseudergate periods determine the developmental fate of particular castes  <cit> .

gene expression is believed to be altered before the molt in particular castes, in preparation for specific morphologies. juvenile hormone  has been considered to physiologically control caste differentiation  <cit> . in many termite species, application of jh  results in differentiation into the soldier form. and thus, the application of jh  is a useful mechanism by which to investigate caste differentiation  <cit> .

among termite lineages, a variety of soldier morphologies are known, which can be classified into several types. these types include the biting soldier, reaping soldier, snapping soldier, or nasute soldier  <cit> . the focal species in the present study, h. sjostedti, has a typical biting soldier morphology which is considered to be the most basic and primitive type among termites. during soldier differentiation, allometric growth of the whole head and mandibles has been observed  <cit> . before the molt, a specific morphogenesis causes complex folds to be formed in the epidermal tissues inside the mandibles; this enables rapid expansion of the mandibles at the time of molt into presoldiers  <cit> . in a previous study, we screened the genes expressed in mandibles during soldier differentiation using the fluorescent differential display method  <cit> . hsjcib, a homolog of the ciboulot  gene in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster, is one of the identified genes thought to be involved in morphogenesis. the cib gene encodes an actin-binding protein and is categorized as a multimeric β-thymosin  <cit> . it is known to be required for the central nervous modification during metamorphosis by genetic and developmental study  <cit>  and to regulate actin polymerization by in vitro study  <cit> . in h. sjostedti, hsjcib in mandibles was the most abundantly expressed at the stage of  <dig> days after jha application, which is when specific epidermal morphogenesis occurs.

multimeric β-thymosins, including cib, have homology with monomeric vertebrate thymosin-β. multimeric β-thymosin includes two-five wh <dig> domains , while thymosin-β includes only one wh <dig> domain  <cit> . although their homology is relatively high, the functions of multimeric β-thymosins and those of thymosin-β are quite different. multimeric β-thymosins are thought to promote actin polymerization, whereas thymosin-β is believed to sequester actin monomers and inhibit their polymerization. hertzog et al.  <cit>  discussed this distinction, and concluded that the amino acid residues at the n terminus of the wh <dig> domain are responsible for the different molecular functions. when the amino acid residues at the structurally important site in thymosin-β were replaced with those of cib, the molecular function was changed from sequestering to assembly-promoting  <cit> . hertzog et al.  <cit>  also proposed a model to predict wh <dig> domain function in many proteins by checking the amino acid residues at the structurally important site. the possible mechanisms by which structural differences translate to functional differences have been discussed previously by several authors  <cit> .

caste differentiation and polyphenism are often regulated through jh signaling, although the mechanisms that link jh signaling and morphological modification remain largely unknown. characterization of the molecules involved in these mechanisms will contribute to the understanding of the regulation of polyphenism. in the present study, we focused on hsjcib, whose partial sequence was previously identified  <cit>  as a gene responsible for morphogenesis during soldier differentiation in response to jh . we cloned the full-length cdna of hsjcib and found multiple isoforms that may serve two different molecular functions. here, we reveal the expression dynamics of hsjcib using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  and in situ hybridization and discuss the possible functional differences among isoforms.

RESULTS
the full-length cdna sequence and the number of wh <dig> domains
on the basis of the partial sequence of hsjcib previously identified by fluorescent differential display  <cit> , we amplified both ends of the cdna using the rapid amplification of cdna ends  method and sequenced the full-length cdnas of hsjcib . the predicted amino acid sequence of the longest hsjcib isoform was compared to other organisms with known sequences possessing wh <dig> domains and found that hsjcib contained five wh <dig> domains . the numbers of wh <dig> domains in known genes vary among organisms: drosophila cib, 3; caenorhabditis tetrathymosin, 4; the sea slug hermissenda csp24/ <dig>  4/5; and a sea squirt ciona multimeric β-thymosin,  <dig>  <cit> . the number of wh <dig> domains in insects varies from three to five, the evolutionary origins and history of duplication/deletion being unclear . the functional significance of the number of wh <dig> domains is still open to debate  <cit> .

the structure of isoforms
five hsjcib isoforms were identified from cdna cloning and sequencing. four isoforms were truncated compared to the largest isoform . of the five isoforms, three had the same length: one 1245-bp isoform, three 1131-bp isoforms, and one 1017-bp isoform . exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> each had a length of  <dig> bp, which corresponded to  <dig> amino acid residues and was the same length as a wh <dig> domain. on the basis of the results of southern hybridization, we considered the identified isoforms to be splice variants from a single gene . the skipping of exons during splicing predicted isoforms with five, four or three wh <dig> domains. the editing sites of the exons were located in the middle of the wh <dig> domains, forming a complete wh <dig> domain when two incomplete portions of wh <dig> domains were spliced together. by northern hybridization, the splice variants were observed to be poorly separated and a broad band was detected . although another band was observed at around  <dig>  kb, we could not conclude whether the band represented an uncloned large isoform, a paralog, or dna carry-over. the approximate arrangement of exons was estimated using the pcr fragments from the genomic dna . the borders between exons and introns were determined by sequencing both ends of the pcr fragments.

western blot analysis
because the expression of mrna does not provide strict evidence of actual protein expression, protein expression was confirmed by western blot analysis . the results were consistent with the expectations for the three isoform sizes from cdna cloning. however, the molecular weights estimated from relative mobility to markers  were larger than those estimated from the predicted amino acid sequences . we considered two possibilities for the inconsistency between the electrophoretic mobility and predicted molecular weights. one possibility was that posttranslational modifications caused the difference in mobility. the homolog in hermissenda, csp <dig>  is known to be phosphorylated  <cit> , and several possible phosphorylation sites were found in the putative amino acid sequences of hsjcib . no possible n-glycosylation site  was found in the amino acid sequences .

although unlikely considering the size relationships, another possibility was that the three isoform sizes did not correspond to the three sizes of bands on the western blot. in that case, the 32-kda band corresponded to an uncloned isoform and perhaps to the  <dig> -kb band observed in northern hybridization. in this possibility, the smallest isoform  derived by cdna cloning should have been scarcely expressed. however, cdna of isoform  <dig> was frequently obtained during the cloning process. because the isoform sequences resembled each other, it was unlikely that cross-reactivity of the antibody to the different isoforms was very different.

in situ hybridization
because immunohistochemistry did not produce a distinct signal , we investigated hsjcib expression in the mandibular tissue by in situ hybridization using  <dig> bases of the rna fragment transcribed as a probe in vitro . on cross sections of developing mandibles, we identified the hsjcib signal in epidermal tissue . although hsjcib was originally observed in the screening for mandibular expression, the expression was also observed in many tissues, as shown in the next section and in fig.  <dig> 

functional differences among hsjcib isoforms
hsjcib isoforms  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> resembled the "sequestering form," since the functionally important residues in the n-terminal side wh <dig> domain  <cit>  were hydrophilic k  and q  . hsjcib isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> resembled the "assembly-promoting form" because the functional residues were a  and t  , which were somewhat hydrophobic . these resemblances were not perfect, and we could not assert their precise functions. the features of the functionally important sites were different among hsjcib isoforms, meaning that their properties should have differed from each other. in the sections below, for simplicity, isoforms  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> will be referred to as "sequestering types," and isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> will be designated "assembly-promoting types." this naming convention should aid in understanding the complicated expression analyses.

quantification of expressions by qpcr
to confirm the gene expression pattern, we performed qpcr for "head" tissues and "thorax + abdomen" tissues over the time course  and for several tissues at the  <dig> d  stage . to detect the isoform joining of exons, we initially tried to identify every isoform separately by making primers on the editing points between exons and introns . this procedure, however, failed to discriminate each isoform separately in the preliminary experiments. consequently, we discontinued quantifying all the isoforms separately, and instead designed primers to quantify exons  <dig> and  <dig> separately. exon  <dig> was contained in all the isoforms, and its expression amounts were equal to those of all hsjcib isoforms . exon  <dig> was contained in isoforms  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  since the existence of exon  <dig> makes a sequestering isoform, its expression amount apparently represents the amount of sequestering isoforms. with this experiment, note that castes  were not necessarily in a same intermolt stage, but use of pooled samples could average their expression levels.

quantification of exon  <dig> in termite heads demonstrated that the expression level gradually increased during soldier differentiation; the highest expression was observed at the  <dig> d stage, just prior to the molt to presoldier . the expression level was subsequently reduced in the presoldier, but was again increased in the soldier. exon  <dig> expression was also increased in the sm stage , although the level was lower than that observed at  <dig> d. a comparison indicated that the days to molt were approximately the same between the sm and  <dig> d stages  <cit> . expression level was not high before the imaginal molt.

exon  <dig> expression levels can be correlated to allometrical changes associated with prospective growth  <cit> . it is notable that expression level of exon  <dig> was highest in the head at  <dig> d when morphogenesis was taking place. thorax + abdomen exon 1-expression was generally lower than that of the head, although at  <dig> d and in the sm stage it was higher than expected. during soldier differentiation, expression of exon  <dig> was much higher in the head samples compared to thorax + abdomen. expression levels were similar in both tissues while in stationary molt . the expression of exon  <dig> was much less than that of exon  <dig> during soldier differentiation, which meant that hsjcib isoforms without exon  <dig>  were primarily expressed.

future wing tissue rapidly grows inside the wing bud in the late nymph stage   <cit> , but considering the active morphogenesis taking place, expression levels of exon  <dig> was not observed to be high. in ln, exon expression was not very different, which meant that hsjcib isoforms with exon  <dig>  were mainly expressed.

quantification in various tissues at  <dig> d revealed hsjcib expression in every tissue that was examined . the exon transcript amounts indicated that the proportions of assembly-promoting type splice variant  and sequestering type splice variant  were different among tissues. the largest proportion of assembly-promoting type splice variant was observed in the brain. this corresponded well to drosophila, in which cib is required in the brain during metamorphosis and for which only the assembly-promoting type is known. in hodotermopsis, the behavioral pattern is greatly altered during soldier differentiation, where hsjcib is possibly involved in neuronal modification with axon growth. in mandible and head epidermis, the proportions of sequestering type variants were higher. isoforms with prospective functions were expressed differentially among tissues, suggesting that hsjcib regulates cellular morphogenesis in diverse ways among various tissues.

discussion
this study demonstrates that the expression profiles of hsjcib, acts as a downstream gene in a regulatory pathway which correlates with tissue morphogenesis occurring in termite soldier differentiation. the genes underlying caste differentiation of social insects have been extensively studied, but the present study is the first report on the detailed expression properties of a possible effector gene for caste-specific morphogenesis.

putative function in soldier differentiation
previously, we demonstrated the expression of hsjcib in mandibles during soldier development was approximately 20-fold higher than that in an intermolt  stage  <cit> . recent experiments show an almost ubiquitous expression of the gene throughout the body. hsjcib expression levels in the thorax + abdomen during stationary molt was unexpectedly equivalent to that in soldier differentiation. although it is not a specific gene to soldier differentiation, hsjcib is required for every molt.

conspicuous morphogenesis in the epidermis and fat bodies before the presoldier molt of hodotermopsis correlates closely to elevated hsjcib expression in the head as well as the thorax + abdomen at the  <dig> d stage  <cit> . in drosophila, cib is involved in neuronal modification during metamorphosis  <cit> . during developmental modification in the brain of hodotermopsis, neuronal changes required for soldier behavior occur  <cit> , implicating high hsjcib expression levels in the axonal growth, retraction or synaptic development during this stage.

soldier differentiation is a peculiar developmental pathway which was acquired only once in the ancestral lineage of termites  <cit> . the present study showed that hsjcib has ubiquitous expression, but when considering its responsiveness to jha treatment and linkage to presoldier-dependent morphogenesis, the jh-dependent elevation of cib expression seems to have evolved in the lineage from an ancestral termite to hodotermopsis. this supports the idea that a preexisting gene recruited for exploitation in soldier differentiation acquired a new regulatory mechanism and novel way of morphogenesis.

relationship between functions and sequence difference among isoforms
the expression level of the assembly-promoting type exon tended to be higher than the sequestering type. these proportional differences imply the control mechanism of these two types. further molecular functional analysis of hsjcib would require protein purification or recombinant protein synthesis as well as subsequent in vitro analysis with actin molecules.

rna interference  is also a way to test the function of hsjcib. however, in our preliminary rnai experiment did not provide clear results of phenotypic impacts .

the role of hsjcib among cytoskeleton-regulating molecules
actin is one of the fundamental cytoskeletal components; its assembly and disassembly are the most important processes of morphogenesis at the cellular level  <cit> . this mechanism was thought to be regulated by various actin-binding proteins  <cit> . in the present study, we analyzed one gene, hsjcib, as a downstream gene in caste differentiation in the termite. multiple actin-binding proteins have been shown to regulate cellular morphogenesis in animals  <cit> . in the termite, other proteins, such as profilin, adf/cofilin and cap  <cit>  in addition to hsjcib could be cooperatively involved in cellular morphogenesis.

morphogenetic regulation during soldier differentiation
cytoskeletal regulators are influenced at multiple levels by various molecules. in our previous work, regulatory molecules such as g-protein-related factor rhogef and splicing factor u2af were revealed to be upregulated in developing mandibles during soldier differentiation  <cit> . considering that soldier differentiation in the termite is triggered by a high jh titer, these genes would be regulated downstream of the jh-signaling cascade. the intrinsic jh titer and histological aspects of hormone-producing glands have been studied extensively in the focal species  <cit> . because the expression of hsjcib was already altered at  <dig> h after jha application, it is conceivable that the expression was directly controlled by jh or through a small number of regulatory factors. further analysis will shed light on the mutual relationships among these factors and the overall picture of soldier differentiation regulation.

in the black marching termite hospitalitermes, which is phylogenetically distant from hodotermopsis, soldier mandibles do not develop; instead, a horn-like structure called a "nasus" is formed during soldier differentiation  <cit> . folding structures of the epidermis and their subsequent unfolding and growth after the molt into presoldier are common mechanisms in biting soldiers  and nasute soldiers   <cit> , suggesting that functions of various genes  would be conserved. extensive search with expressed sequence tag  analysis, which has already been performed in reticulitermes  <cit> , will help to obtain a more comprehensive picture of this unique morphogenesis.

there is limited knowledge regarding the regulatory mechanism of the exaggerated morphology and phenotypic plasticity of insects  <cit> . the generalized question would be if there is a common molecular bases among independent lineages of species with exaggerated morphologies. the regulatory mechanism for phenotype and their connection to the subsequent processes of morphogenesis are important for understanding phenotypic evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study documents the characteristics of the termite homolog of an actin-binding protein gene, hsjcib, which is one of the downstream genes for soldier differentiation. hsjcib includes up to five wh <dig> actin-binding domains, and functional differences in actin polymerization among isoforms were predicted on the basis of their similarity to homologous genes of other organisms. during caste differentiation, multiple isoforms were expressed with different quantitative ratios in various tissues. we propose the high probability that the functions of these isoforms during soldier differentiation involve cephalic morphogenesis and neural rearrangement, enabling soldier-specific exaggerated morphology and defensive behavior.
