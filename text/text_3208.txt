BACKGROUND
salmonella outbreaks are a major health challenge and medical problem around the world. of the ~ <dig>  strains, salmonella enterica and enteridis cause 75% of total disease incidence  <cit> . disease occurrence has resulted in economic burdens of $ <dig>  to $ <dig>  billion due to healthcare costs and productivity loss  <cit> . emergence of drug resistant salmonella strains is a strong rationale for the development of easily implemented dietary strategies to reduce susceptibility to infection  <cit> . evidence suggests that presence of some indigestible saccharides and polyphenols in the diet can affect survival and maintenance of gut microflora as well as help prevention of colonization by enteric pathogens  <cit> . for example, non-digestible carbohydrates can be fermented by native gut lactobacillus spp. which results in the production of organic acids, such as bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxides. these byproducts are associated with reduced growth of salmonella <cit> . therefore, dietary supplementation represents a novel approach to aid in the induction of protective responses against enteric infections.

little is known regarding the potential impact of whole foods on the colonization of salmonella in the small intestine because traditional biomedical research methods focus on the effect of single nutrients or isolated dietary small molecules  <cit> . rice is an important staple food worldwide and the bran portion is typically removed, making rice bran widely available for human and animal consumption. rice bran contains prebiotic components  <cit> , and is a rich source of bioactive polyphenols, fatty acids and peptides  <cit> . dietary rice bran intake has been shown to increase the fecal iga and native gut lactobacillus spp. in mice  <cit> . also, rice bran has been found to control gastrointestinal cancers, hyperlipidemia and diabetes in rats  <cit>  as well as hypercholesterolemia in humans  <cit> .

the primary goal of this study was to examine the effect of dietary rice bran intake on susceptibility of mice to oral challenge with salmonella. the salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain 14028s was chosen for these studies because it is a translational model of non-lethal, infection in female 129 s6/svevtac mice  <cit> . the protective effect of rice bran against salmonella infection in mice was measured by decreased fecal shedding following oral challenge. these novel findings of rice bran bioactivity have practical implications for developing accessible, affordable and effective dietary public health intervention strategies to reduce salmonella infections worldwide.

RESULTS
effect of dietary rice bran intake on salmonella fecal shedding
daily dietary rice bran supplementation was examined in a mouse model of salmonella infection. control and rice bran diets were fed to mice for one week prior to oral challenge with s. typhimurium and during infection. mice consuming the rice bran diet showed a time dependent decrease in the fecal shedding of salmonella as compared to control diet animals . more specifically, animals fed the 10% rice bran diet exhibited decreased salmonella fecal shedding by a log <dig> value of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in comparison to animals fed the control diet on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post infection, respectively . animals fed the 20% rice bran diet showed a reduction in salmonella fecal shedding by a log <dig> value of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in comparison to the animals fed the control diet on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. no significant difference was observed in salmonella fecal shedding between the  <dig> and 20% rice bran diet groups. these data demonstrate that pre-feeding dietary rice bran for one week reduced the susceptibility of mice to oral infection with the salmonella pathogen as measured by fecal shedding.

effect of dietary rice bran on serum cytokines
previous research demonstrated that in response to primary salmonella infection, the host immune system releases massive amounts of the cytokines such as tnf-α, ifn-γ and il- <dig> locally and systemically  <cit> . the local inflammatory response has been shown to shift the microbiota composition allowing salmonella the opportunity to efficiently colonize in the gut  <cit> . therefore, due to the fact that rice bran mediated a decrease in fecal shedding, we next measured the cytokine level in the serum of mice consuming either the  <dig> or 20% rice bran diets . mice fed the 10% rice bran diet for 7 days had decreased serum levels of tnf-α, ifn-γ, and il- <dig> by  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  pg/ml respectively in comparison to animals on the control diet . additionally, mice fed the 20% rice bran diet showed decreased levels of serum ifn-γ in comparison to control animals . these data suggests that rice bran induced suppression of systemic cytokine production may play a role in reducing the colonization of salmonella.

effect of dietary rice bran on fecal lactobacillus spp
members of the genus lactobacillus are potent commensal bacteria with potential for eradication of salmonella infection  <cit> . uninfected mice on the  <dig> and 20% rice bran diets had a  <dig> and 167-fold higher  numbers of fecal lactobacilli, respectively, compared to mice on the control diet . following infection, the levels of fecal lactobacilli remained higher  in the mice consuming the rice bran diets than in the control diet fed mice . these data suggest that rice bran induced changes in gut microbiota may be in part responsible for reduced fecal shedding of salmonella.

rice bran extract inhibited salmonella entry and replication in vitro
the ability of salmonella to invade intestinal epithelial cells is an important step involved in the establishment of infection  <cit> . the ability of rice bran components to interfere with salmonella entry was tested in the mouse small intestinal epithelial  cell model. concentrations of rice bran extract  that did not affect msie cell viability were used  in these studies . rbe  reduced the entry of salmonella into msie cells by 27% compared to controls  . the rbe in cell culture media did not kill salmonella directly and therefore did not confound the results of reduced pathogen entry .

we next assessed the ability of rbe to inhibit the intracellular replication of salmonella in msie cells . after infection and incubation, extracellular bacteria were removed by washing and antibiotic treatment, and kept for  <dig> h with rbe. the  <dig> mg/ml dose of rbe reduced intracellular salmonella replication by 30%  in comparison to control. no direct effect of rbe on salmonella extracellular growth and replication was detected . these results suggest that the rice bran extract contains bioactive compounds that block salmonella entry into msie cells as well as inhibit intracellular salmonella replication in in vitro model.

we next assessed the ability of rbe to inhibit the intracellular replication of salmonella in msie cells . after infection and incubation, extracellular bacteria were removed by washing and antibiotic treatment, and kept for 24 h with rbe. the 2 mg/ml dose of rbe reduced intracellular salmonella replication by 30%  in comparison to control. no direct effect of rbe on salmonella extracellular growth and replication was detected . these results suggest that the rice bran extract contains bioactive compounds that block salmonella entry into msie cells as well as inhibit intracellular salmonella replication in in vitro model.

rice bran diet components and weight of animals
dietary rice bran intake did not significantly change the body weight of animals in the experimental and control groups throughout the various studies . the total lipid content of the neptune rice variety is  <dig> %; therefore we adjusted the amount of corn oil in the diets to equalize the total fat content in the control, 10% and 20% rice bran diets . also, various dietary components may act as substrates for the gut microflora, and for that reason the total amounts of starch and cellulose were adjusted to balance the macronutrient content across groups.

discussion
in this study, we examined the ability of dietary rice bran to protect mice against an oral challenge with salmonella. decreased salmonella fecal shedding is a reliable marker for reduced susceptibility to infection  <cit>  and was used herein to determine whether dietary rice bran supplementation reduced susceptibility to salmonella infection. fecal shedding of salmonella from orally challenged mice fed  <dig> and 20% rice bran diets was significantly reduced as compared to control diet . consistent with previous research, the highest number of fecal salmonella in the control diet fed mice was observed on day  <dig>  followed by a reduction in salmonella numbers on days 8– <dig>   <cit> . salmonella fecal shedding in rice bran fed mice was consistently lower than control diet fed mice until day 9-post infection.

we chose this mouse model of salmonella infection over other models because the 129 s6/svevtac mice do not die from disseminated salmonella infection due to presence of both functional copies of the nramp <dig> gene whereas other strains would die within 7–14 days of inoculation  <cit> . although our data suggested that rice bran supplementation decreased salmonella invasion in the ileum, peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph node of the rice bran fed mice, these values were not significant . thus, the rice bran diet reduced salmonella fecal shedding may be a result of the induction of increased colonization resistance in the intestinal lumen as opposed to the increased horizontal transfer of salmonella into the tissues  <cit> .

gut inflammation resulting from salmonella presence favors the colonization and growth of the salmonella because of changes in gut ecology and environment  <cit> . local inflammation in the intestine occurs in conjunction with a massive systemic release of tnf-α, ifn-γ and il- <dig>  <cit> . the rice bran fed mice showed a significant reduction in serum inflammatory cytokines associated with salmonella infection, namely tnf-α, ifn-γ and il- <dig> . the presence of salmonella antigens in the lumen is in part responsible for inducing the inflammatory cytokines in control diet fed animals. therefore, a reduced salmonella antigen load in the lumen of rice bran fed mice may have diminished this inflammatory response. determining the mucosal immune cells involved in the development of local and systemic inflammation by salmonella in these mice will be important for understanding the mechanisms by which rice bran modulates the inflammatory response.

given that salmonella induces changes in the gut microbiome  <cit> , we next explored differences in the gut microbial communities between control and rice bran fed mice as a plausible mechanism for the reduced colonization of salmonella . our exploratory data showed increased firmicutes in rice bran diet fed animals as compared to control animals before infection . the phylum firmicutes contains the genus lactobacillus and rice bran fed animals demonstrated a ~ <dig> fold increase in fecal lactobacillus spp. content as compared to control before infection . probiotic lactobacillus spp. protect against salmonella infection through production of lactic acid that modulates bacterial virulence gene expression and can help maintain tight junctions of mucosal epithelial cells  <cit> . changes in the gut microbiota by dietary rice bran warrant a separate study to explore this novel mechanism for prevention and reduced susceptibility to salmonella infection.

rice bran is a collection of numerous bioactive components  <cit>  that may exhibit multiple mechanisms of action for protection against enteric pathogens. methanol extracts contain bioactive polyphenols and fatty acids from rice bran  <cit> , and were used for the treatment of msie cells in vitro. rbe reduced the cellular entry of salmonella by 27% in comparison to control . in addition to reduced salmonella entry, rbe also decreased intracellular salmonella replication by 30% . these in vitro findings merit further investigation of the rice bran effects on the epithelium in vivo. rice bran phytochemicals may inhibit pathogen entry and intracellular replication of salmonella either by modulating the epithelial cytoskeleton, blocking receptors, altering the cellular microenvironment, and/or by influencing virulence gene expression  <cit> . additional mechanisms may include increased production of bile and gastric acids and increased intestinal motility by dietary rice bran. future studies are warranted to elucidate these mechanisms and to determine the specific combinations of bioactive rice bran components responsible for protection against infection . our findings provide a rationale for biomedical scientists to work closely with rice crop scientists for advancing our understanding of rice bran-microbe interactions. these findings set the stage for additional work with the rice industry, public health and veterinary nutritionists to determine whether the dietary supplementation of rice bran offers greater mucosal protection against enteric infections in people and animals.

CONCLUSIONS
our study has indicated a potential use for dietary rice bran to mitigate salmonella infection. increasing consumption of rice bran represents a promising and novel means for reducing susceptibility to enteric infection with salmonella, potentially through the modulation of native gut lactobacillus spp. further investigation in animal models and human clinical studies will be necessary to elucidate mechanisms of action and physiological importance of dietary rice bran supplementation against enteric infections.
