BACKGROUND
bacterial artificial chromosomes  are ideally suited for the stable maintenance of large dna sequences derived from viral genomes  <cit> . a considerable number of bac systems have been established for large dna viruses; in particular many different herpesvirus genomes have been cloned into bacs . the first bac systems using rna virus cdnas were described for coronaviruses  <cit>  and recently the first bac containing a full-length cdna for a negative-stranded rna virus was described  <cit> . similarly, cdnas corresponding to the full-length genomes of members of the flaviviridae family  have been inserted into bacs.

bacs containing full-length cdnas of pestiviruses , including bovine viral diarrhea virus  and classical swine fever virus  have recently been established  <cit> . infectious pestiviruses can be rescued using rna transcripts derived from these bacs. the pestiviruses have single stranded positive sense rna genomes, about  <dig>  kb in length, which includes a single long open reading frame, encoding a large polyprotein, flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions  that are critical for autonomous replication of the genome  <cit> . the polyprotein is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into four structural proteins  and eight non-structural proteins . the availability of genetically defined and stable pestivirus bacs facilitates the functional study of viral proteins or rna structures and also the development of new marker vaccine candidates. several csfv vaccines with marker properties based on chimeric pestiviruses have been developed over the years  <cit> . in particular, chimeric pestiviruses with substitution of the entire e <dig> protein have been described  <cit>  but also mutants with more subtle modifications, such as the modification of the important tav-epitope  <cit>  within the csfv-e <dig> protein  <cit>  are promising marker vaccine candidates.

manipulation of bacs using traditional cloning procedures can be difficult  and thus a range of methodologies that apply bacterial genetics, including homologous recombination  within the e. coli host, have been developed . the use of homologous recombination allows site-directed mutagenesis of bacs  <cit>  and, by employing a counter-selection scheme, specific modifications can be obtained without leaving residual “foreign” sequences  <cit> . the main advantage of this method is that there are no target limitations  and no need for suitable restriction sites. the integration of the modified sequence is performed in vivo  thereby potentially being more accurate than in vitro approaches like pcr-based methods. although in vitro cloning approaches based on the use of high-fidelity polymerases for pcr amplification have significantly improved in recent years, the use of in vivo approaches should allow a more accurate method of mutagenesis due to the use of the cells own high-fidelity replication system which includes proof reading. whereas bac recombination has been commonly used for modifying dna viruses, there are only very few reports about the use of this technology for rna viruses  <cit> .

here, a generally applicable strategy for the manipulation and rescue of chimeric pestiviruses from bacs is described as a model, and the flexibility of this approach is demonstrated by generating different modifications in the viral cdna of the new csfv-bac, pbelor <dig>  derived from the modified live vaccine strain “c-strain riems”. the targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis described here includes the substitution of the  <dig> amino acid  linear tav-epitope  present in the e <dig> protein with the corresponding region  of a heterologous pestivirus  and also the replacement of the entire csfv e <dig> protein coding region with the whole e <dig> coding region from the same bdv, to generate marked vaccine viruses that can be discriminated using specific anti-e <dig> monoclonal antibodies. the genetic stabilities of both the bac constructs  and the rescued viruses have also been assessed.

methods
cells and viruses
porcine kidney  and sheep fetal thymoid  cells were grown at 37°c  co2) in dulbecco’s minimal essential medium  supplemented with 5%  pestivirus-free fetal calf serum. virus from a bait containing the modified live vaccine csfv “c-strain riems”  was propagated once in pk <dig> cells and termed vriemser. rna obtained from bdv strain “gifhorn”  <cit>  was used for amplification of the gifhorn e2-coding sequence.

oligonucleotide primers used are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

bac constructs
the bac construct, pbelor <dig>  was constructed using the long rt-pcr method as previously described  <cit>  using rna derived from the “c-strain riems”. briefly, full-length viral cdnas flanked by noti sites were amplified by long rt-pcr using primers 5′cstrain_t7_not <dig>  and 3′csfv_not <dig> . the product  was digested with noti and inserted into similarly digested pbelobac <dig> . all bacs were modified and maintained in e. coli dh10b cells  grown at 37°c in lb medium containing chloramphenicol . the electroporation of bacteria was performed in  <dig>  cm cuvettes using  <dig> pulse at 1800 v, 25 μf and  <dig> Ω in a gene pulser xcell . bacs to be used as templates for long pcr or for screening by restriction enzyme digestion were purified from 4 ml overnight cultures of e. coli dh10b using the zr bac dna miniprep kit . bacs required for direct genome sequencing were purified from 500 ml cultures using the large-construct kit .

modification of the csfv cdna by red/et recombination
modifications to the full-length csfv cdna were accomplished in e. coli dh10b  using the counter selection bac modification kit .

the red/et recombination involved three steps . step i) the temperature-sensitive predet expression plasmid  was introduced into electroporation-competent e.coli dh10b cells containing the parental bac . the predet expresses the phage lambda proteins redα, redβ and redγ, under control of the arabinose-inducible pbad promoter, allowing homologous recombination to occur. immediately after electroporation, pre-warmed lb medium without antibiotics  was added to the cells which were then incubated at 30°c for 1 hour, prior to spreading onto agar plates containing cam  and tetracycline   and then incubated at 30°c overnight to maintain the predet. the presence of the predet plasmid  was verified by visual inspection of bac-dna preparations from the camr/tetr colonies using agarose gel electrophoresis. step ii) counter-selection marker cassettes with an extra noti site for screening purposes  were amplified by pcr using primers with  <dig> nt or  <dig> nt extensions that were homologous to the target site in the bac using the rpsl-neo plasmid  as template and the phusion hot start ii hf dna polymerase  with cycling conditions as follows: 98°c for 30s, followed by 35 cycles of 98°c for 10s, 60°c for 20s, 72°c for 60s, and 1 cycle at 72°c for 4 min. the pcr products  were isolated on 1%  tbe agarose gels and purified using a genejet gel extraction kit . samples , from an e. coli culture containing predet and the parental bac grown overnight at 30°c in lb media , were used to inoculate  <dig>  ml of fresh lb media with the same antibiotics to obtain exponentially growing bacteria at 30°c. red/et recombination proteins were induced by adding 50 μl of 10%  l-arabinose . the pcr product  containing the rpsl-neo cassette was introduced into these bacteria using electroporation . following electroporation, the cells were grown at 37°c for 70 min  and then selected on plates containing cam , tet  and kanamycin  overnight at 30°c to maintain the predet. note, the rpsl cassette confers streptomycin sensitivity  onto the resistant dh10b strain and the neo confers kanamycin resistance . the correct phenotype  of the resulting colonies was confirmed by streaking the colonies onto plates containing cam , tet  and kan  and grown at 30°c. importantly, for the third step, the replacement of the rpsl-neo cassette , the selected colonies were also streaked onto plates containing cam  plus strep  and shown to be streps indicating incorporation of a functional rpsl gene. the structures of the intermediate bacs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing around the inserts. step iii) the replacement of the rpsl-neo selection cassettes from the intermediate constructs using linear dna fragments was achieved through counter-selection and red/et recombination. again, the homologous sequences at the ends of the dna fragment were used for red/et mediated recombination events to replace the rpsl-neo cassette with the sequence of interest. counter-selection against the rpsl-neo cassette  was employed using media containing cam  and strep  to isolate the required derivatives .

initially, the intermediate construct, pbelor26_e2rpslneo , was generated using red/et recombination by insertion of the rpsl-neo cassette with an extra noti site for screening purposes which was amplified using primers criems-tavfor and criems-tavrev  in place of the tavspttlr coding sequence . secondly, the rpsl-neo cassette in this intermediate construct was then replaced using counter-selection red/et recombination using a single-stranded oligonucleotide, riems_tav_gifhorn  with the same homology arms as used for the rpsl-neo cassette, to introduce the coding sequence for the bdv “gifhorn” epitope sequence . the resulting construct was named pbelor26_tav . the initial intermediate construct  was then used to produce the pbelor26_e2gif construct . for this, the e <dig> coding sequence was amplified from cdna prepared from bdv “gifhorn” rna using two different primer pairs, one set with  <dig> nt homology arms  and another with  <dig> nt homologous sequences .

for generation of bacs with substitution of the entire e <dig> coding sequences, pcr products consisting of the sequence of interest flanked with homology arms identical to the target area were generated by pcr . for making constructs with substitution of shorter sequences , the recombination was achieved using synthetic single stranded oligonucleotides rather than pcr products. pre-heating of single stranded oligonucleotides at 95°c for 2 min followed by snap-freezing, prior to electroporation, empirically showed the best results. in each case, the dna molecules were introduced into e. coli containing the bac derivatives including the rpsl-neo cassettes together with the predet plasmid by electroporation as described above. the structures of the modified bacs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and subsequent full-genome sequencing .

rescue of viruses and virus growth curves
bac dna  was linearized with noti or 1 μl bac dna was used as template for long pcr amplification using primers 5′c-strain_t7_not <dig> and 3′csfv . linearized bacs or pcr products were purified with the genejet pcr purification kit  and transcribed in vitro using a megascript t <dig> kit . viruses were rescued from rna transcripts  by electroporation of porcine  or ovine  cells essentially as described previously  <cit> . cells were analysed using immunofluorescence microscopy  for the expression of ns <dig> and e <dig> proteins using specific monoclonal antibodies , these were anti-ns <dig> , anti-csfv e <dig>  and anti-bdv e <dig>   together with alexa  <dig> conjugated goat anti-mouse igg antibody . the nuclei of cells were visualized using dapi  and images were recorded using a bx <dig> fluorescence microscope . for peroxidase staining, cells were fixed and stained for the presence of pestivirus antigens using biotinylated pig anti-csfv/bvdv polyclonal igg followed by avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase  as previously described  <cit> . the same staining procedure was also performed using the anti-e <dig> mabs. samples containing virus-positive cells were passaged onto new cells. virus growth curves were generated as previously described  <cit> . briefly, pk <dig> or sft-r cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  pfu/cell and grown for three days. at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 72 hours post infection  or at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 72 hours post infection , cell samples were harvested for virus titration. cell samples containing virus from each time point were assayed on pk <dig> or sft-r cells by limiting dilutions and grown for three days to determine the virus titre .

genome sequencing
bac dnas , purified using the large-construct kit , or pcr products  amplified from viral cdna or from bacs using the long pcr method  were consensus sequenced using a  <dig> flx  or an ion pgm . both newbler  and the bwa.bwasw alignment algorithm  <cit>  were used for mapping the reads to the expected sequence. a combination of samtools  <cit>  and lofreq snv-caller  <cit>  was used for downstream single nucleotide variant  analysis. finally, clone consensus sequences were aligned using mafft in the geneious software platform .

RESULTS
generation of a bac containing full-length cdna corresponding to the modified live vaccine “c-strain riems”
bacs containing the full-length cdna corresponding to the parental vriemser  were constructed according to the method described previously for the “paderborn” strain of csfv  <cit> . bacs containing the complete csfv cdnas were identified by restriction digest analysis and following linearization by noti, rna transcripts were produced and electroporated into pk <dig> cells. this screening resulted in the identification of a bac containing a cdna insert of  <dig> nt, pbelor <dig> , which yielded infectious virus, termed vr <dig>  that could be propagated in sft-r cells  and in pk <dig> cells . the rescued vr <dig> displayed higher growth rate at the early stage  compared to the parental vaccine virus, but after 48 hours similar virus titres were obtained . full-genome sequencing of the cloned bac template, pbelor <dig>  revealed a number of differences throughout the genome when compared to the full-length consensus sequence of the cdna used for the cloning procedure . these differences are non-representative variants within the cdna. overall, the bac sequence differed from the cdna sequence in  <dig> positions,  <dig> of these lead to predicted amino acid substitutions within the polyprotein; one in each of npro, erns, e <dig>  e <dig> and ns <dig> and four amino acid substitutions in ns5b . when compared to the published reference sequence , the pbelor <dig> bac sequence differed at an additional  <dig> positions,  <dig> of these lead to a predicted amino acid substitution and there was one large insertion  in the hypervariable region of the 3′-utr .

*nt position  <dig> in vr26/p- <dig> is reverted from a to g as in the parental cdna.

homologous recombination to obtain csfv e <dig> chimeric constructs
to determine the utility of the targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis system for pestiviruses, two different modifications of the e <dig> protein coding sequence within pbelor <dig> were generated using the red/et recombination methodology. initially, the sequence encoding the linear tav-epitope  within the csfv-e <dig> was substituted with the sequence encoding the corresponding region  from the bdv strain “gifhorn” as described in the materials and methods section. more than 90% of the colonies obtained using this procedure contained the required bac structure as determined by noti digestions. the complete genome sequences of the csfv cdna within two selected bacs, designated pbelor26_tav have been verified . in addition, the complete coding sequence  for the csfv-e <dig> protein was substituted by the corresponding sequence from bdv “gifhorn”. again more than 90% of the colonies obtained contained the required bac and the same proportion of correctly recombined bacs was obtained using either  <dig> nt or  <dig> nt homology arms. the chimeric bac was designated, pbelor26_e2gif and the complete virus genome sequence  was verified .

rescue of modified virus from recombined bacs
after electroporation with rna transcripts derived from either pbelor26_tav or pbelor26_e2gif a large number of csfv ns3-positive cells could be observed  and chimeric virus stocks, termed vr26_tav and vr26_e2gif, were generated after further passages in cells. cells infected with these viruses and with the parental vr <dig> and vgifhorn strains were all stained with mabs directed against the ns <dig> protein . however, in contrast to the parental vr <dig> virus, the chimeric viruses rescued from the recombined bacs were not recognized by anti-e <dig> mabs specific for the csfv-e <dig> proteins  and thus, consistent with their structure, displayed the same antibody reaction pattern as vgifhorn. two different anti-csfv e <dig> mabs, wh <dig> and wh <dig>  were used for the staining and the latter has been shown previously to target the tav-epitope  <cit> . as anticipated, cells infected with either the vgifhorn or with the chimeric vr26_e2gif could be shown to express the “gifhorn” e <dig> protein using staining with an anti-bdv mab . the presence of the bdv epitope ttvststla in vr26_tav was insufficient to permit efficient recognition by this anti-bdv mab, although a weak signal was observed in some cells.

genetic stability of the bacs in the bacterial host
the bac constructs pbelor <dig> and pbelor26_e2gif were analysed for the genetic stability of the cdna to determine the suitability of the bac vector for maintaining full-length pestivirus cdnas. e. coli dh10b cells containing the bacs were passaged  <dig> times, by overnight growth, and the complete viral cdnas within the bacs were sequenced after the 1st and the 15th passage. no mutations were observed within the  <dig> nt virus cdna sequences after this extensive propagation of the bacs in the bacterial host, indicating a highly stable system for the maintenance of complete pestivirus cdna sequences.

genetic stability of viruses rescued from the bacs
the viruses, vr <dig> and vr26_e2gif, rescued from their respective bac constructs, were also tested for their genetic stability within mammalian cells. linearized bac dna was transcribed in vitro and the rna was electroporated into pk <dig> cells. three days after electroporation the cells were stained with the anti-ns <dig> antibody to detect the presence of replicating virus. samples containing virus positive cells were passaged onto new cells, this process was repeated for  <dig> separate passages . the virus titre  was determined for each passage. passage of the rescued vr26_e2gif chimeric virus in pk <dig> cells resulted in rapidly decreasing virus titres and was discontinued after the 2nd passage . instead, further passage of this chimeric virus was performed in ovine sft-r cells  and resulted in much higher titers of the chimeric virus. virus titers reached more than  <dig> tcid50/ml after the 1st passage and remained stable for  <dig> passages . the rescued vr <dig> was also efficiently propagated on the sft-r cells but maintained a slightly lower titer than the vr26_e2gif chimeric virus . to check that the viruses retained their antibody reaction properties  after these passages, cells were infected with viruses from the 12th sft-r cell culture passage  and stained with a polyclonal anti-pestivirus serum and with specific mabs directed against the csfv-e <dig> and bdv-e <dig> proteins . cells infected with either the vr26/p- <dig> or the chimeric vr26_e2gif/p- <dig> were each detected by the polyclonal anti-pestivirus serum as expected. the anti-csfv-e <dig> mab specifically detected cells infected with vr26/p- <dig> but not cells infected by the chimeric virus containing the bdv-e <dig> protein . in contrast, the anti-bdv-e <dig> mab specifically detected infection by the vr26_e2gif/p- <dig> and did not recognize cells infected with vr26/p- <dig>  each result is in accord with the structure of the viruses.

the 4th passage of vr <dig>  displayed a slower growth rate than the virus obtained after  <dig> passages . it also had a reduced growth rate compared to both the vr26_e2gif/p- <dig> and vr26_e2gif/p- <dig>  the full-length sequence of pbelor <dig> had revealed ten non-silent mutations compared to the reference sequence  for this virus . any of these mutations could be responsible for the impaired growth acting alone or in concert. for further investigation of this issue, full length cdnas prepared from vr26/p- <dig>  vr26/p- <dig>  vr26_e2gif/p- <dig> and vr26_e2gif/p- <dig> were deep-sequenced using both the  <dig> flx and ion pgm platforms for comparison and to determine the quasispecies distribution . sequencing data from both platforms revealed that both the vr26/p- <dig> and vr26_e2gif/p- <dig> were close to 100% changed at nt position a10665g compared to the bac clones . this adaptation is a reversion back to the consensus cdna sequence of the parental vaccine virus, vriemser . additionally, vr26/p- <dig> and vr26_e2gif/p- <dig> already showed evidence for this reversion being present within the population. for vr26/p- <dig>  the level of reversion was 57%, while for vr26_e2gif/p- <dig> the extent of change was 73% .

discussion
in this study, we have established the first bac containing the full-length cdna of a csfv vaccine strain. the bac differed from the parental cdna sequence in  <dig> positions leading to  <dig> aa substitutions . the method that has been used for the generation of pbelor <dig> is based on full genome amplification of cdna followed by direct cloning to obtain the bacs  <cit> . this approach results in cdna clones that reflect the quasispecies composition of the parental viral rna and thus it is not guaranteed to obtain cdna clones corresponding to the consensus sequence of the cdna used. however, it is possible to correct the mutations using the bac recombination approach if a consensus clone is needed. to demonstrate the utility of the red/et mediated recombination method we have generated a series of modified bacs derived from this csfv full-length cdna. these include bacs with substitution of the linear tav-epitope present in the e <dig> protein and also bacs with substitution of the complete e <dig> protein with heterologous pestivirus sequences. we have also used the same approach for a range of different targeted modifications within csfv bacs including specific deletions and substitutions in the 5′utr of csfv  <cit>  and for insertions of heterologous reporter sequences into csfv replicons  <cit> . using red/et recombination-mediated mutagenesis for the targeted design, the work can be expedited and focused, in principal, on any sequence within the viral genome and is not dependent on the use of internal restriction sites. the results demonstrate that red/et recombination-mediated mutagenesis of pestivirus bac cdnas provides a useful tool for advancing the construction of modified pestiviruses.

cells infected with the parental vr <dig> virus were recognized by the two anti-e <dig> mabs  specific for the csfv-e <dig> proteins, in contrast cells infected with the modified viruses vr26_tav and vr26_e2gif, rescued from the recombined bacs, were not detected by these mabs. furthermore, as expected, cells infected with the vr26_e2gif were recognized by the anti-bdv mab  whereas no staining was observed with this antibody in vr <dig> infected cells or in cells with vr26_tav. the mab wh <dig> recognizes the csfv tav-epitope  <cit>  and the difference in  <dig> aa between the tav-epitope and the corresponding sequence from bdv strain “gifhorn” is enough to completely abolish the recognition by this mab. the lack of staining of vr26_tav infected cells by the wh <dig> indicated that the tav-sequence is also important for the epitope recognized by this mab. thus, the chimeric pestiviruses, vr26_tav and vr26_e2gif, containing heterologous e <dig> sequences can be readily discriminated from the vr <dig> using specific anti-e <dig> monoclonal antibodies. these new chimeric pestiviruses represents c-strain based marked vaccine candidates with the characteristics desired for safe and efficacious diva vaccines against csfv. indeed, vr26_e2gif vaccinated pigs could be efficiently discriminated from c-strain vaccinated pigs and from csfv infected pigs using csfv-e <dig> specific antibody elisas .

genetic stability in the bacterial host
nucleotide sequence data for the pbelor <dig> showed a number of changes from the published reference sequence for “c-strain riems”. some of these differences are present in the cdna derived from the vaccine stock at a detectable level whereas others may represent low-level variants within the cdna or errors introduced by the rt-pcr amplification. full-length sequencing revealed that no changes occurred in the cdna during extensive propagation in e. coli dh10b of the pbelor <dig> and the e2-chimeric derivative, pbelor26_e2gif, indicating a very high stability of these bac-cloned csfv cdnas. this is essential if this system is to be useful for cloning and sequence manipulation, and contrasts with stability problems encountered with conventional plasmids containing full-length pestivirus cdnas  <cit> . the stability of these bacs is consistent with previous reports on the stability of bacs containing other viruses of the family flaviviridae in e. coli <cit> .

genetic stability of rescued viruses
extensive passaging of the rescued vr <dig> and the chimeric virus derivative, vr26_e2gif, resulted in a change at nucleotide position a10665g  within the ns5b coding region. the same reversion to the consensus sequence for the “c-strain riems” virus was observed in two independent virus populations, derived from independent bacs, and indicates that this substitution is important for efficient growth of the “c-strain riems” virus in sft-r cells. in contrast, all other nucleotide positions remained unchanged during the extensive virus propagation including the heterologous e <dig> sequences . the glycine  residue at position  <dig> in the polyprotein is highly conserved amongst csfv strains; indeed, alignment of csfv sequences retrieved from genbank did not reveal any variation at that position . whether this mutation was derived from the cloning procedure or reflects a low-level variant present in the parental vaccine stock is unclear.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study shows that targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis of bacs containing full-length csfv cdna facilitate manipulation and rescue of chimeric pestiviruses. the system shows high genetic stability of the bac constructs  and the chimeric viruses rescued from the bacs can be efficiently and stably propagated in sft-r cells and this represents a suitable system for the production of virus stocks for future marked vaccine experiments. the strategies employed in this study have applicability not only for csfv  but should be adaptable to the study of other rna viruses.
