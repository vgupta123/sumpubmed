BACKGROUND
developing neurons extend long neurites to create a complex network. key structures in the elongation of neurites are a highly motile growth cone and a stable neurite shaft, the latter generated by the suppression of protrusive activity. neurite elongation and branching are governed by coordinated rearrangements of the cytoskeletal dynamics of actin and microtubules  <cit> . the actin cytoskeleton provides protrusive and contractile forces and microtubules form a polarized network allowing organelle and protein movement throughout the cell. neurite protrusion requires a protrusive force to push the plasma membrane forward, as well as an addition of membrane materials. this includes microtubule fragmentation and local accumulation of f-actin for the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia and subsequent neurite branching, also called sprouting  <cit> . in addition, protein glycosylation has been proposed to play a crucial role in the regulation of neurite elongation and branching  <cit> : proteins that have been shown to regulate neurite outgrowth are regulated by n-linked oligosaccharides in folding and activity  <cit> . many proteins involved in the coordination between microtubules and actin have been identified  <cit> . among these, calpain, which is localized along the neurite shaft, prevents branching through the proteolysis of cortactin  <cit> . cortactin, in turn, is an actin-binding protein that activates the actin-related protein 2/actin-related protein  <dig> complex  to initiate filopodia formation. this signaling pathway is extensively studied and apparently not only involved in neurite extension  <cit> . the stabilisation or destabilisation of the cytoskeleton by intracellular signaling cascades is, in turn, controlled by extracellular cues. among others, phospholipids such as lysophosphatidic acid  and sphingosin-1-phosphate  mediate cell motility, growth, proliferation and survival  <cit> . modulation of phospholipid signaling occurs by members of the lipid phosphatase/phosphotransferase family   <cit> . one lpt subgroup consists of the vertebrate-specific plasticity-related genes   <cit> . one of the five known prgs is prg <dig> , an integral membrane protein with six predicted transmembrane helices linked by intra- and extracellular loops  <cit> . previous analyses showed that prg <dig> mrna is expressed as early as embryonic day  <dig> in cerebral cortex and hippocampus formation  <cit> , suggesting a role in neuronal differentiation. cortical prg <dig> showed a gradient of expression with a higher level of expression in the dorsal cortex in comparison to the lateral cortex  <cit> . the mrna level decreased to basal expression in adulthood  <cit> . functional tests of prg <dig> suggested a role during neurite outgrowth: prg <dig> overexpression induced the formation of actin-rich, dynamic filopodia in several cell lines such as n1e- <dig>  hela, and cos- <dig> cells  <cit> . interestingly, this induction was not mediated by cdc <dig> or rif, a rho-family gtpase, and was independent of the arp2/ <dig> complex  <cit> . the neurite outgrowth was also not directly linked to phosphatase activity against any of the well-characterized lpt substrates, because no enzymatic activity for prg <dig> was shown  <cit> . this study was designed to transfer findings on prg <dig> actions to a neuronal, physiologically relevant developmental context and clarify the functional importance of endogenous prg <dig>  our results indicate that i) prg <dig> in immature neurons is located in all neurite shafts, where it determines neurite protrusions; ii) prg <dig> expression in more mature neurons is predominantly axonal; iii) prg <dig> expression patterns are not influenced by and do not influence synaptic currents; and iv) glycosylation of prg <dig> is a prerequisite for membrane insertion.

antibody generation and purification
two polyclonal rabbit antibodies recognizing different sequences of prg <dig> protein were generated. one was targeted to a sequence on the first extracellular loop  and the other to a sequence on the intracellularly located c-terminus . the sequences used to generate both antibodies were identical between rat and mouse prg <dig> and are highlighted in blue in figure 1a. the peptides  for generating anti-prg <dig>  <dig> and  <dig> were synthesized by biogenes . the n-terminal cysteine residue was included for conjugation of the peptide to a carrier protein. immunization and antibody production were performed by biogenes. the antibodies were subsequently affinity-purified against the corresponding peptide with hitrap nhs-activated hp columns  according to the manual. the antibody was dialyzed against pbs and stored at −20°c. the specificity of the antibodies was tested by immunoblot analysis. here the antibody was preincubated with the corresponding peptide or bsa for control, for  <dig> hours at room temperature  before adding the antibody to the membrane.

cell line transfection
hek <dig> cells  were routinely maintained at 37°c with 5% co <dig> in dmem  supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin . hek <dig> cells were plated in 6- or 12-well plates with a density of  <dig>  cells/cm <dig> and transfected the next day with calcium phosphate precipitation:  <dig> μg dna,  <dig>  μl sterile water,  <dig>  μl calcium chloride and  <dig>  μl  <dig> × hepes-buffered saline were mixed and either the whole amount added to one well for the 6-well plates or divided into two wells for the 12-well plates. one day after transfection the cells were used for further analyses.

primary mouse hippocampal neuron, astrocyte and microglial cultures
hippocampal neurons were isolated from c57bl/ <dig> mouse embryos at embryonic day  <dig>  hippocampi from several embryos were collected and washed twice in ice-cold hbss . the tissue was incubated in  <dig> ml hbss and  <dig> μl trypsin  for  <dig> minutes at 37°c, resuspended in plating medium   <dig> % glucose,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin). after dissociation, the neurons were plated in plating medium onto poly-l-lysine  coated cover slips into 12-well plates or dishes with a cell density of  <dig>  –  <dig>  cells/cm <dig> or for a low-densitiy cell culture  <dig>  –  <dig>  cells/cm <dig>  three hours after plating, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline  and incubated in neurobasal a medium  supplemented with 2% b <dig> ,  <dig>  mm glutamine,  <dig> u/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  for electrophysiological experiments neurons were plated with a density of  <dig>  cells/cm <dig> and cultured in the absence of antibiotics. to block synaptic activity the medium was supplemented with  <dig> μm cnqx to block ampa/kainate receptors,  <dig> μm dapv to block nmda receptors, and  <dig> μm gabazine to block gabaa receptors. medium was changed every second day. the treatment started from div  <dig> and lasted until div  <dig> 

astrocytes and microglia were prepared as previously described  <cit> . briefly, mouse cortex  was isolated and carefully homogenized. digestion was performed by  <dig> minutes trypsin incubation. dissociated glial cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes and incubated at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  after two days the medium was refreshed and the cells were incubated until most of the microglial cells had detached from the astrocytes. the cells were shaken for two hours at 37°c and the remaining free-floating microglia were removed.

preparation of total protein lysates and recombinant proteins
hek <dig> cells were washed with ice-cold pbs, lysed in a detergent-containing lysis buffer  containing protease inhibitors , and sonicated  <dig> ×  <dig> seconds. subsequently, the lysates were centrifuged for  <dig> minutes at  <dig>  × g and 4°c.

mouse primary cells or organs were lysed in non-detergent-containing lysis buffer  with protease inhibitors. after sonication, the lysates from primary cells or organs were incubated on ice for  <dig> minutes and centrifuged for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> × g and 4°c. protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by a bca protein assay kit . to obtain recombinant protein, prg1-egfp, prg2-egfp, prg3-egfp and prg5-egfp were purified from transfected hek- <dig> cells using the μmacs epitope tagged protein isolation kit , as recommended by the manufacturer.

immunoblotting
protein extracts from cells or tissues were subjected to 12% sds-page under reducing conditions and then blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane  by semi-dry protein transfer. blots were blocked for  <dig> hour at rt in 10% non-fat dry milk diluted in pbs and then incubated overnight at 4°c with a 1: <dig> dilution of anti-prg <dig>  <dig> or  <dig>  1: <dig> dilution of anti-flag , 1: <dig> dilution of anti-gfp , 1: <dig> dilution of anti-β-actin , 1: <dig> dilution of anti-gfap  or 1: <dig> dilution of anti-tuj <dig> . after three washes in  <dig> × pbs, the membranes were incubated with a 1: <dig> dilution of an anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody  for  <dig> hours at rt. for detection of iba <dig> the membrane was incubated with a 1: <dig> dilution of anti-iba <dig>  in 5% non-fat dry milk, for  <dig> hour at rt. after three washes in pbs the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody 1: <dig> diluted in  <dig> × pbs containing 5% non-fat dry milk for  <dig> minutes at rt. immunoreactive bands were detected using ecl western blotting detection reagents .the intensity of the western blots bands was measured by using the metamorph software, version  <dig> r <dig>  the gray intensity of the control band was set to 100%. all other bands were calculated to the control. beta-actin was used for normalization.

deglycosylation of prg3
for detection of potential n-glycosylation, mouse brain or hek <dig> total protein lysates were treated with peptide-n-glycosidase f  as recommended by the manufacturer. controls of mouse brain or hek <dig> protein lysates were treated using the same process but without pngase f.

point mutation of prg3
point mutation of the as  <dig> of prg <dig> from asparagine to glutamine within the expression plasmid p3×flag-cmv <dig> -rprg <dig> was performed with the quikchange ii site-directed mutagenesis kit  using the following primers: for 5´-ctgaca gtgtgccagccacaatataccagtacagactgc-3´ and rev 5´-gcagtctgtactggtatattgtggctgg cacactgtcag-3´  as recommended by the manufacturer.

electrophysiology
hippocampal neurons were transfected at  <dig> or  <dig> days in vitro  using effectene  according to the manufacturer’s specifications. one to three days post transfection neurons were placed in a bathing solution consisting of :  <dig> nacl,  <dig> kcl,  <dig> cacl <dig>   <dig> mgcl <dig>   <dig> hepes,  <dig> glucose; ph adjusted to  <dig>  with naoh. an inverted microscope  equipped with phase contrast, a 25× objective and a  <dig> w mercury lamp was used to visualize neurons. pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution comprising  <dig> k-gluconate,  <dig> kcl,  <dig> na-phosphocreatine,  <dig> mgcl <dig>   <dig> cacl <dig>   <dig> egta,  <dig> hepes,  <dig> mg2+ atp and  <dig>  gtp ; ph set to  <dig>  with koh. intracellular solution was stored on ice. miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents  were recorded at a holding potential of − <dig> mv and in a bath solution containing  <dig>  μm ttx  and  <dig> μm bicuculline . experiments were performed at rt  with an epc- <dig> patch clamp amplifier  controlled by pulse  software. all recordings were filtered with a  <dig>  khz bessel-filter and sampled with a minimum frequency of  <dig>  khz. analysis of intrinsic neuronal properties was performed using pulsefit  and origin  <dig> . mepscs were analyzed with winedr and winwcp . the automatic detection parameters were set to a threshold of  <dig> pa and a dead time of  <dig> ms. although the threshold was about two times the noise level, false–positive events were detected and detection failures occurred, therefore a visual identification of events was performed. the amplitude of mepscs was calculated from the averaged baseline before the event to the  <dig> point averaged peak of the event. data were compiled and presented using origin. statistical analysis was performed in origin and statview . anova was used for multiple comparisons, student’s t-test for two normal distributed data sets and mann–whitney u test for two non-normal distributed data sets. significance level was set to p <  <dig>  . data from individual experiments are presented as box plots with boxes showing the 25th and 75th percentile, as well as the maximum and minimum. a line crossing the box and individual data points indicates the mean.

immunostaining of cultured cell lines and primary neurons
primary hippocampal mouse neurons and transfected neurons at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> div or transfected hek <dig> cells were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde with 15% sucrose in pbs for  <dig> minutes at rt and washed three times with pbs. permeabilization was performed by adding  <dig> % triton x- <dig>   <dig> % sodium citrate in pbs for  <dig> minutes at 4°c. after washing the cells three times they were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum  for  <dig> hour at rt. cells were then incubated with primary antibody in 10% fcs in pbs overnight at rt in the following dilutions: 1: <dig> anti-prg <dig>  <dig>  1: <dig> anti-tau <dig> , 1: <dig> anti-β-actin, 1: <dig> anti-α-tubulin, 1: <dig> anti-map <dig>  anti-tuj <dig> or 1: <dig> anti-flag , 1: <dig> anti-gfp and anti-na+/k+-atpase . after three washes with pbs, alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies , diluted 1: <dig> in pbs containing 10% fcs, were added for  <dig> minutes at rt. finally, cells were washed three times and mounted with immu-mount . confocal images were acquired with an upright laser microscope . background correction and adjustment of brightness and contrast were performed using leica confocal software. for co-localization studies z-stacks of both fluophore were sequentially acquired and average projected.

for immunofluorescence quantification the cellsens dimensiondesktop version  <dig> . <dig> xv  <dig>   software from olympus was used. the green fluorescence  intensity was measured in a region of interest  as a maximum pixel fluorescence intensity drawn over three distinct map <dig> positive or tau <dig> positive areas for the prg <dig> abundance on tau <dig> and map <dig> positive structures. all measurements were performed using three different immunostainings. data analysis was performed using graphprism  <dig>  from n =  <dig> rois for map <dig> and n =  <dig> rois for tau <dig> positive structures. data are reported as mean +/− sem.

the red fluorescence  intensity was measured in a region of interest as a mean pixel fluorescence intensity drawn over five distinct areas, to quantify the knock-down  efficiency in tuj <dig> positive neurons. all measurements were performed using three different immunostainings. data analysis was performed using graphprism  <dig>  from n =  <dig> for prg <dig> shrna and n =  <dig> for control shrna transfected neurons. data are reported as mean +/− sem.

rna extraction and cdna synthesis
organs were harvested from c57bl/ <dig> mice and homogenized in trizol  reagent. primary neurons, microglial cells, or astrocytes were scraped in pbs, centrifuged for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> rpm and 4°c. cell pellets were dissolved in trizol reagent. total rna was extracted using trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the concentration and purity of the isolated total rna were determined by spectrophotometric analysis . cdna was synthesized with  <dig> μg of total rna using the high-capacity cdna archive kit  according to the manufacturer's protocol. as a control, reaction was performed without multiscribe reverse transcriptase. cdna was diluted 1: <dig> with rnase, dnase-free water and stored at −20°c. the quality of the amplified cdna  was controlled by β-actin pcr. identity and purity of primary cells was shown by quantitative real-time pcr with the neuron-specific class iii β-tubulin  as a marker for neurons, the glial fibrillary acidic protein  as a marker for astrocytes and the ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule  <dig>  as a marker for microglial cells  <cit> .

quantitative real-time pcr
reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  was performed with the following gene expression assays: prg <dig> , iba <dig> , gfap , tuj <dig> , gapdh  and β-actin  . for hprt, separate primer and probe were used . the pcr was run on the abi prism™  <dig> sequence detection system  and the data obtained were processed by abi prism software. standard curves were produced with serial dilutions of cdna from p <dig> mouse cortex with amplification efficiency between  <dig> and 100%. data were normalized to two different house-keeping genes , which produced similar results. each result is the average of three separate experiments and error bars represent sd.

morphological analysis
primary neurons were transfected after  <dig> day in vitro  with the shprg <dig> construct, the shprg <dig> construct together with a prg <dig> rescue mutant, or control shrna targeting firefly luciferase using effectene and analysed at div  <dig>  for the morphological analysis fluorescence images were acquired with an olympus bx <dig> microscope equipped with metamorph software . confocal images of primary neurons were acquired with an upright laser microscope  equipped with a 63× objective  using the  <dig> nm line of an argon-ion laser. background correction and adjustment of brightness and contrast were performed using leica confocal software . the length of the longest neurite was measured in metamorph. for subsequent analyses the numbers of branching points were determined by counting the number of neurites according to their respective order . a neurite was classified as a “branch” when it was longer than  <dig> μm. the number of protrusions between  <dig> and  <dig> μm and between 5– <dig> μm were quantified as separate subgroups. for both groups protrusion length was measured from the tip to the intersection with the protrusion shaft. the mean total process length per neuron was evaluated by quantifying the length of all processes . for averaging the protrusion length per neuron the major neurite was omitted. all measurements were performed using three to four different transfection preparations by investigators blind to the experimental conditions. data analysis was performed using graphprism  <dig>  data are reported as mean +/− sem, which are also presented as error bars in the figures. significance was assessed using the two-tailed student's t-test for unpaired data at the given significance level  where: **  <dig>  < p <  <dig> ; *  <dig>  < p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
prg <dig> requires n-glycosylation for insertion in the cell membrane and influencing of filopodia development
in order to identify the prerequisites for prg <dig> activity, e.g. intracellular as opposed to plasma-membrane binding, we raised two polyclonal antibodies against prg <dig>  one was targeted at an extracellular loop  and the other at the intracellular c-terminus  . both new antibodies were shown to be sensitive as they detected the prg <dig> protein i.) when endogenously present in mouse brain protein lysates, and ii.) when fused to gfp  and overexpressed in hek <dig> cells . specifically, western blot analysis showed one double band at 37– <dig> kda in native brain lysates and another double band at 61– <dig> kda in prg3-overexpressing hek <dig> cells . the bands match the in silico predicted molecular weight of  <dig> kda for prg <dig> and  <dig> kda for the gfp-tagged prg <dig> . both antibodies are specific, as prg <dig> was undetectable after pre-incubation of the antibodies with their corresponding peptides . further, we detected no cross-reaction to other prg family members with both antibodies .

the existence of double bands in the immunoblots points to a putative glycosylation of the prg <dig> protein. indeed, hydrolyzation of n-linked glycan chains from mouse brain glycoprotein lysates with peptide-n-glycosidase f   <cit>  resulted in a single band with lower molecular weight  in the immunoblot using anti-prg <dig>  <dig> . furthermore, we identified a putative consensus n-glycosylation site at aa  <dig> within the second extracellular loop via in silico analysis of rat and mouse prg <dig> . glycosylation is a posttranslational modification that plays a crucial role in the sorting and targeting of numerous proteins to their respective cell compartments  <cit> . we therefore hypothezised that altered prg <dig> glycosylation could strongly influence its subcellular localization. to abolish n-glycosylation we point-mutated prg <dig>  by substituting asparagine for glutamine  <cit> . this n163q mutation in its native, non-deglycosylated form showed only the lower molecular weight band of the endogenous protein together with a second band on the molecular weight of the deglycosylated form compared to wild-type 3xflag-prg <dig> . with pngase f treatment the n163q mutant showed a single band at approximately  <dig> kda.

next, we tested whether the n-glycosylation of prg <dig> influences plasma membrane targeting by transfecting wild-type 3xflag-prg <dig> and 3xflag-prg <dig> n163q into hek <dig> cells. overexpression of 3xflag-prg <dig> induceed an increase in filopodia formation in comparison to control-transfected cells , whereas the 3xflag-prg <dig> n163q mutant showed no alteration in the morphology compared to controls . additional evidence for membrane localization was obtained by staining with the surface marker na+/k+-atpase  <cit> . mutated prg <dig> failed to localize into the plasma membrane, in contrast to wild-type prg <dig> that showed co-localization with the plasma membrane marker .

taken together, both endogenous prg <dig> and 3xflag-prg <dig> fusion proteins were glycosylated by n-glycosylation, which is required for the plasma membrane targeting of prg <dig>  prg <dig> overexpression induces filopodia formations. however, the lack of prg <dig> in the plasma membrane did not alter the cell morphology.

prg <dig> is mainly expressed in the brain and is developmentally regulated
as the formation of processes is a prerequisite for the development of most tissues, we comparatively analyzed mouse prg <dig> mrna expression in different organs at p <dig> by quantitative rt-pcr . this revealed the highest levels of prg <dig> expression in brain and at least ten times lower levels in kidney, liver and testis. additionally, lung tissue showed only a very weak signal that was just above the detection level. no prg <dig> mrna expression was detectable in thymus and spleen . interestingly, western blot analysis only showed prg <dig> protein expression in brain protein lysates . there was no signal for any of the mouse tissues even after prolonged chemiluminescence exposure. the anti-prg <dig>  <dig> antibody yielded the same result .

given that prg <dig> mrna has been shown to be developmentally regulated in the hippocampal region  <cit> , we evaluated the abundance of prg <dig> mrna and protein expression during development in this area. between e <dig> and p <dig> we detected prg <dig> mrna at high levels in hippocampal tissue . prg <dig> mrna expression then decreased more than 10-fold between p <dig> and p <dig> . this expression pattern was reflected on the protein level: the level of prg <dig> protein expression was high between e <dig> and p <dig>  peaked between p <dig> and p <dig> and rapidly decreased until adulthood . these data suggest that the prg <dig> protein is exclusively expressed in brain tissue and that prg <dig> might contribute to hippocampus development.

prg <dig> is prominently expressed in neurons
to further specify the cellular abundance of prg <dig> we used qrt-pcr to analyze its expression in primary cultured neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells. primary cultured hippocampal neurons showed the highest levels of prg <dig> mrna, whereas the signal was over ten times weaker in astrocytes and microglial cells . in western blot analysis prg <dig> expression was clearly detectable in primary neurons, whereas we found no prg <dig> signal in cultured astrocytes and microglia . the purity of primary cells was tested by immunoblotting with anti-tuj <dig>  anti-gfap and anti-iba <dig> . however, this neuron-specific expression pattern of prg <dig> had no influence on intrinsic and general biophysical neuronal properties. we determined this by establishing different prg <dig> levels in neurons via overexpression of prg <dig> or shrna-induced reduction of native prg <dig> and compared the functional properties to the corresponding controls. to determine the prg <dig> shrna efficiency we analysed western blots after overexpression of prg <dig> together with the shrna in hek <dig> cells. as specificity control of the prg <dig> shrna we generated a prg <dig> shrna-resistant construct, which was not effected by the prg <dig> shrna . furthermore, to demonstrate the neuronal specificity of the prg <dig> shrna we analysed and quantified the endogenous prg <dig> level in primary neurons after transfection of the shrna by immuncytochemistry . the endogenous prg <dig> level, detected by antibody staining, was reduced to less than 50% after transfection with the prg <dig> shrna. in both approaches we detected a clear reduction of prg <dig> protein.

the neurons responded consistently to a family of hyper- and depolarizing currents . in particular, suprathreshold currents evoked repetitive action potentials in all neurons. subthreshold current injections were used to determine additional parameters of intrinsic neuronal excitability such as input resistance and resting membrane potential. irrespective of the cellular amount of prg <dig> these parameters appeared similar. moreover, the whole cell capacity, an approximated measurement of the cell surface, did not differ between the experimental groups . hence, prg <dig> is predominantly expressed in primary cultured hippocampal neurons, but does not profoundly interfere with the basal intrinsic functional properties of these neurons.

subcellular distribution of endogenous prg <dig> in primary hippocampal neurons changes during development
motivated by the prominent neuronal expression of endogenous prg <dig> and its role in filopodia formation, we investigated the subcellular distribution of prg <dig> in primary neurons at different developmental stages. after  <dig> day in culture, hippocampal neurons exhibited several undifferentiated, α-tubulin-containing processes of similar length . during this initial phase of neuronal development, prg <dig> appeared as a dotted, clear, strong signal in the plasma membrane and as weaker intracellular signal . beta-actin was strongly localized in growth cones and lamellipodia. interestingly, prg <dig> was expressed all over the plasma membrane except in the growth cones and lamellipodia, where ß-actin was located . the distribution of prg <dig> was uniform in more mature polarized neurons . here, the microtubule cytoskeleton turns into parallel oriented bundles to form a nascent neurite shaft  tipped by an actin-rich growth cone . prg <dig> was expressed in the plasma membrane along the neurite shafts, whereas β-actin-rich areas of the growth cone lacked prg <dig> expression . at this developmental stage, the neurons had established a single axon and several dendrites. prg <dig> was present in the neurite shafts of axons, as shown by co-localization with tau <dig>  an axonal marker protein,  as well as in dendrites, as shown by co-localization with map <dig>  a dendritic marker protein .

however, in neurons at div  <dig>  when an extensive network of synaptic connections is established, prg <dig> was predominantly expressed in axons  as shown by co-localization with tau <dig>  in contrast, neurites that were positive for map <dig>  showed hardly any prg <dig> expression at this time point. to measure the abundance of prg <dig> in axons and dendrites, the fluorescence intensity of prg <dig> on tau <dig> or map <dig> positive structures were analyzed. the prg <dig> expression on map <dig> positive structures is only half the amount as on tau <dig> positive structures . in summary, prg <dig> was present in all neurites after the beginning of axogenesis at div  <dig>  but shifted towards predominant axonal expression by div  <dig> 

prg <dig> knock-down in young primary hippocampal neurons decreases the number of neurites
because filopodia formation is a crucial step in neurite outgrowth, prg <dig> might influence cell morphology. to investigate the effect of endogenous prg <dig>  primary neurons were transfected with prg <dig> shrna and morphologically analyzed. we neither observed a difference in the number of branching points  nor in the length of the longest neurite . however, shrna-induced knock-down of prg <dig> expression decreased the number of neurites with a length between  <dig> and  <dig> μm , whereas neurites with a length between 5– <dig> μm were not changed in number. additionally, the average neurite length per neuron showed no alteration between prg <dig> knock-down and control . to confirm that the observed neuronal phenotype was a specific result of the prg <dig> shrna expression, the prg <dig> shrna knock-down neurons were co-transfected with an shrna-insensitive prg <dig> construct. the numbers of neurites with a length of 2– <dig> μm in neurons co-expressing prg <dig> shrna and shrna-resistant prg <dig> was not different from that in those expressing control shrna. thus, overexpression of shrna-resistant prg <dig> in prg <dig> knock-down neurons completely rescued the reduction of neurites with a length of 2-5μm .

we also performed opposite analyses by overexpressing prg <dig> in young  primary neurons. here, we demonstrated an increase in the number of neurites with a length between 2– <dig> μm, but no change in number of neurites with the length of 5– <dig> μm . however, the average neurite length per neuron was not affected by prg <dig> overexpression . this set of data suggests that prg <dig> is involved in the induction of protrusions at the neurite shaft.

prg <dig> distribution is not influenced by and does not affect synaptic currents in cultured hippocampal neurons
the prg <dig> shift occurred in time and space in parallel to the beginning synaptogenesis of hippocampal neurons in culture  <cit> . we thus hypothesized first that the dendritic attenuation of prg <dig> might ease stabilize synapse formation or second that developing synaptic inputs contribute to the prg <dig> shift. an overexpression system was particularly suitable for investigating the first hypothesis because differences in expression levels between axon and dendritic structures seen in endogenous prg <dig> protein distribution  were not detectable . we selected div <dig> as time point of transfection, because the prg <dig> shift reached a steady state and synaptogenesis was still on a low level before the steep increase from div  <dig> on  <cit> . at div  <dig> we somatically recorded miniature excitatory synaptic currents  of prg3-overexpressing neurons  and respective controls. the mepscs were pharmacologically and electrically isolated. this was achieved in the presence of  <dig>  μm tetrodotoxin,  <dig> μm bicuculline and a holding potential of − <dig> mv . in the case a dendritic persistence of prg <dig> interfered with proper synapse formation, we expected differences in incoming signals. however, neither the frequency nor the mean amplitude of the mepscs was affected by elevated levels of prg <dig> distributed throughout the cell when compared to neurons with native prg <dig> expression .

to investigate the second part of the hypothesis that synaptic inputs might have affected the prg <dig> dendrite-axonal shift, we blocked all inputs to the postsynaptic dendrites by supplementing the media with  <dig> μm cnqx to block ampa/kainate receptors,  <dig> μm dapv to block nmda receptors, and  <dig> μm gabazine to block gabaa receptors. such treatment from div  <dig> to div  <dig> did not lead to any change in the prg <dig> dendrite-axonal shift . we observed a gradual localization shift of prg <dig> from dendrites to axons over several days . both observations led us to conclude that the prg <dig> shift is not functionally linked to the simultaneously occurring synaptic events.

discussion
we present novel findings regarding the role of prg <dig> during neuronal development. firstly, we provide evidence that posttranslational modification of prg <dig> is essential for plasma membrane targeting and that neurite outgrowth is affected by mislocated prg <dig>  secondly, we demonstrate dominant prg <dig> mrna and protein expression and localization in primary neurons that was dynamically regulated during development. thirdly, functional analysis has revealed that prg <dig> is involved in the induction of protrusions at the neurite shaft.

posttranslational modification of prg3
prg <dig> appeared as a glycoprotein after transfection in hek <dig> cells and endogenously in mouse brain lysates. prg <dig> is n-glycosylated, as predicted by in silico analysis and previously reported by others  <cit> . the n-glycosylation sequence in the second extracellular loop of prg <dig> has also been identified in other lpt family members as a consensus glycosylation sequence  <cit> . in addition, our results show that n-glycosylation of prg <dig> is essential for plasma membrane localization and that the latter is required for an increase of filopodia formation. however, prg <dig> is also localized at intracellular membrane structures  <cit> , seemingly independently of n-glycosylation.

endogenous prg <dig> expression during development
previous studies have shown the distribution of prg <dig> transcripts in rat and mouse brains  <cit> . furthermore, semiquantitative northern blot analysis revealed highest mrna expression in brain and lower levels in liver, kidney and testis  <cit> . these data are in line with our results, which showed approximately 10-fold higher mrna expression levels in brain compared to liver, kidney and testis. on the protein level, prg <dig> only appeared in brain samples. therefore, we conclude that the expression level in kidney, liver and testis is below the detection level of our newly generated antibodies. in contrast, an antibody directed against a sequence located on the c-terminus of prg <dig> just before the sequence used for generating anti-prg <dig>  <dig> in this study, revealed a strong prg <dig> expression signal in kidney, lung, and spleen, whereas a weaker signal appeared in brain and heart tissue and hardly any signal was observed in liver  <cit> . however, similar to the antibodies generated by us, the latter antibody also detected prg <dig> overexpression and endogenous prg <dig> expression as a double band around the predicted molecular mass  <cit> . as we could not detect any mrna expression in spleen tissue, the differences between these antibodies in detecting prg <dig> protein expression levels cannot simply be explained by distinctions in the respective detection sensitivities of the antibodies. further investigations are required to clarify this discrepancy.

functional role of prg3
prg <dig> expression is dynamically regulated after birth. we show that prg <dig> mrna levels and prg <dig> protein levels decreased around ten-fold between p <dig> and p <dig>  in contrast to the early embryonic expression of prg <dig>  prg <dig>  another member of the lpp-super family, is first detectable at e <dig> and shows a strong upregulation after birth in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex  <cit> . this temporal expression pattern during brain development suggests either different or complementary functional roles of both proteins. our data rather point to the first option. prg <dig> function has been suggested as an important player in the control of hippocampal excitability  <cit>  and it promotes outgrowth capability during regenerative sprouting  <cit> . however, prg <dig> is expressed along all neurites in young cultured hippocampal neurons, with higher expression in the neurite shafts than in ß-actin-positive growth cones. both a highly dynamic growth cone and a stable neurite shaft are required for neurite extensions. the neurite shaft is generated during the consolidation process, which results from the collapse of the proximal part of the growth cone and the suppression of protrusive activity along the neurite  <cit> . in addition to the localization of prg <dig>  our molecular data  lead us to propose that prg <dig> has a function in the control of neurite shaft protrusion. neurite consolidation requires constant active repression of protrusive activity  <cit> . we demonstrate that knock-down of prg <dig> reduces the capacity of young hippocampal neurons to initiate protrusions. this, together with results of previous studies showing that prg <dig> overexpression in different cells induces filopodia formation  <cit> , suggests that prg <dig> plays a role in the regulation of neurite shaft consolidation and could therefore control filopodia formation. thus, prg <dig> could act as a mediator for extracellular cues, which influence the initiation of neurites at the neurite shaft  <cit> , therewith controlling active neurite consolidation.

interestingly, prg <dig>  another member of the prg family, induces cdc42-independent filopodia formation  <cit> . whether both of these proteins act together in the process of neurite outgrowth will be clarified in the future.

in the more mature developmental stage of primary neurons, endogenous prg <dig> expression switches to a mainly axon-specific expression pattern. generally, neurites acquire either axonal or dendritic identity during development. in this process, some growth-promoting molecules like par <dig>  par <dig> and phospho-gsk-3β, which had initially been expressed in all neurites, are restricted solely to one neurite, which subsequently becomes the axon  <cit> . both the establishment and maintenance of neuronal polarity involve coordinated and widespread regulation of the cytoskeleton and membrane-trafficking machinery  <cit> . whether prg <dig> plays a role in this context remains to be examined in further studies.

furthermore, overexpression or knock-down of prg <dig> in juvenile primary hippocampal neurons induced no changes in membrane resistance or potential. this suggests that prg <dig> expression and localization do not interfere with basic intrinsic neuronal properties and functions at this time point. although their temporal and spatial similarity is striking, there appeared to be no functional coupling between dendrite-axonal shift of prg <dig> and synaptic function. our present approach targeted the capacity of neurons with pre-existing synapses to regulate the amount of new synapses or its function by dendritic prg <dig> levels. at the time chosen, continuous synaptogenesis occurs with approximately  <dig> synapse per hour  <cit>  with rather an upward trend  <cit> . however, the ability of synapses to form  seems independent of prg <dig>  because spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials were detected in cultured hippocampal neurons already at div  <dig>  <cit> , a time point when dendrites are still packed with prg <dig> 

the lack of an influence on synaptic function in juvenile hippocampal neurons distinguishes prg <dig> from its family member prg <dig>  which has been shown to influence mepsc frequencies in the ca <dig> of juvenile mice  <cit> . interestingly, prg <dig> has also been shown to be located mainly in dendrites under non-pathological conditions. however, prg <dig> protein expression was specifically upregulated in regrowing axons in the denervated outer molecular layer following lesion of the entorhinal cortex. there it attenuates phospholipid-induced axon collapse in neurons and facilitates outgrowth in the deafferented zone  <cit> . it remains to be elucidated whether prg <dig> also plays a role in neuronal regeneration processes.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, prg <dig> is highly expressed and regulated during brain development. it exhibits a mainly neuron-specific expression pattern. prg <dig> is strongly expressed in the neurite shaft in young primary neurons. the knock-down of prg <dig> reduces the capacity of young hippocampal neurons to initiate protrusions along the neurite shaft. therefore, prg <dig> could play a role in the regulation of active neurite consolidation. in more mature neurons, prg <dig> expression is predominantly localized in the axon, and changes in prg <dig> expression distribution do not affect currents.
