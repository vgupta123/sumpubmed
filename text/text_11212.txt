BACKGROUND
gene expression profiling using microarrays has rapidly become an analytical tool of choice for translational research laboratories. genome-wide or more dedicated microarrays are generally used as a fishing expedition to identify candidate genes or pathways that can be used either for their prognostic performance and/or for their therapeutic potential in many diseases. the technique relies on the relative quantification of mrna expression in cells or tissues. circulating blood cells can be used as an alternative to tissue biopsies when these are not available. this alternative nevertheless assumes that a systemic biosignature of the pathological state exists and can be assessed through gene expression profiling of blood cells. consistently, while biosignatures of blood cells were originally reported to be a useful prognostic tool for acute myeloid leukemia  <cit> , several studies later showed that these biosignatures can also aid in the development of biomarkers of several diseases affecting vital organs such as the brain  <cit>  and the coronary arteries  <cit> . both peripheral blood mononuclear cells  <cit>  and whole blood cells  <cit>  have been used in such profiling experiments. one has nonetheless to keep in mind that the method of rna collection, either from blood cells using the paxgene™ technology for instance  <cit> , or from buffy coats  <cit> , is a critical variable when designing research protocols using microarray studies  <cit> . the paxgene™ system is attractive because it stabilizes rna immediately after collection without the need of rapidly isolating the leukocyte compartment. this is particularly relevant when designing clinical protocols in which patients are included any time of the day . in addition, this system requires only a very limited volume of blood. however, the reliability of this system to consistently detect all gene transcripts may be questioned  <cit> .

in addition to the type of blood collection, every steps of the microarray technique can influence the quality of the results. when minute starting amounts of rna are available, additional steps of amplification have to be performed  <cit> . this scenario is frequent when using the paxgene™ system since rna is extracted from only  <dig>  ml of blood. such rna is generally processed through a multiple steps procedure to generate amplified amino allyl rna  coupled with fluorescent dyes. first, rna is reverse transcribed, then amplified with incorporation of amino allyl utp  to serve as an arm to facilitate dye binding, and finally coupled with fluorescent dyes before hybridization onto microarrays. this fastidious protocol introduces supplementary bias in the microarray technique, sometimes leading to false positive discovery and erroneous results  <cit> . some alternatives have been developed, such as the universal linkage system technology  or the ovation® technology . optimization of the amplification procedure has been tackled by previous investigators, such as waddell et al. who reported two different methods for amplification of bacterial rna to be assessed in microarray experiments  <cit> . a popular approach to balance the problem of false discovery is to validate microarray data using an independent technique, such as northern blot hybridization, rnase protection assay or real-time quantitative pcr , the latter being the more widely used  <cit> . most commonly performed on cdna obtained from reverse transcription  of total rna, qpcr may also be performed on aa-arna leftover from microarray experiments . this is particularly valuable when limited amount of rna is available for validation - in case of research protocols using the paxgene™ system for instance. however, care should be taken when designing such validation experiments. here, we report our experience with microarray validation by qpcr on aa-arna and we present an optimized protocol that improves the reliability of this validation.

RESULTS
an alternative to total rna to perform microarrays validation by qpcr
we took profit of an ongoing protocol of our lab which aimed at identifying new prognostic biomarkers of renal graft rejection. hypothesizing that inflammation in the organ donnor conditions the success of transplantation  <cit> , we analyzed the transcriptome of whole blood cells of brain-dead organ donors by microarrays. the hypothesis beyond this protocol was that graft rejection by the receiver may be predicted by the transcriptomic analysis of blood cells from the donor. total rna of whole blood cells collected in paxgene™ tubes from  <dig> brain-dead organ donors was extracted. since a limited volume of blood  was withdrawn in these tubes, only a low amount of rna could be extracted. after taking out  <dig> μg of total rna for microarrays, only  <dig> donors had enough remaining total rna to perform validation experiments by qpcr. in an attempt to find an alternative material than total rna to perform validation experiments, we tested whether qpcr could be performed on aa-arna leftover from microarray experiments.

amplification and amino allyl labeling of rna inhibits qpcr
to compare the effectiveness of qpcr from total rna and aa-arna, we used samples from the  <dig> donors for which we had both aa-arna and remaining total rna.  <dig> μg rna and  <dig> ng aa-arna were reverse transcribed and resulting cdnas were diluted 10-fold before amplification by qpcr using primers specific for the actb gene. the rationale for using different amounts of rna and aa-arna is that aa-arna is generated from only mrna  primer being used during first strand dna synthesis in the amplification protocol) whereas rna includes all rna species. the choice of  <dig> μg rna and  <dig> ng aa-arna, as already used by others  <cit> , was performed to represent the low proportion of mrna in total rna. we found that actb expression, as determined by cq values, was lower when using aa-arna compared to rna . as a reminder, expression levels are inversely correlated to cq value, which corresponds to the cycle of the qpcr for which a sufficient number of amplicons have accumulated to allow for a reliable quantification. compiled from the  <dig> patients, cq was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for rna and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for aa-arna. this difference was highly significant . as shown in figure 1b, there was a strong linear correlation between the cq values obtained from rna and aa-arna for each patient . these results attest that amplification and amino allyl labeling decrease the yield of qpcr without affecting its fidelity, most probably due to steric inderance engendered by incorporation of amino allyl arms. therefore, the use of aa-arna to validate microarray results by qpcr is an attractive opportunity that requires optimization.

amplification and amino allyl labeling decrease qpcr sensitivity and efficiency
following experiments were performed with a universal reference rna - the same as used for microarrays - because of its high quality and availability. this rna is a commercially available mix of total rna from  <dig> human cell lines. we first aimed to reproduce the inhibition of qpcr on aa-arna reported in figure  <dig> with other genes than actb. universal reference rna was either amplified using t <dig> polymerase and coupled with amino allyl arms to generate aa-arna, or kept under its primary form . both rna and aa-arna were reverse transcribed with superscript ii. resulting cdnas were diluted 10-fold and subjected to qpcr using primer pairs specific for  <dig> genes selected among our "genes of interest": vascular endothelial growth factor b , matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> , transferrin receptor , hepcidin antimicrobial peptide , and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . for instance, the rational for choosing vegfb, a member of the family of angiogenic factors, came from the concept that angiogenesis plays a role in renal graft rejection  <cit> . figure 2a displays vegfb amplification chart for the two types of rna. while this chart attested for the reliability of the amplification, we observed that cq values increased from  <dig>  for rna to  <dig>  for aa-arna . similar results were obtained with the other genes . compiled from the  <dig> genes, cq values were in average  <dig> cycles higher for aa-arna compared with rna . interestingly, mmp <dig>  which was readily detected when rna was used as input , could not be detected with aa-arna . then the two types of cdnas were serially diluted before amplification by qpcr to evaluate qpcr efficiency. analysis of vegfb qpcr revealed that qpcr efficiency decreased from  <dig> % for rna to  <dig> % for aa-arna . correlation coefficients of standard curves were typically >  <dig> . these data show that amplification by t <dig> polymerase and incorporation of amino allyl arms inhibit both pcr sensitivity and efficiency. this inhibition may prevent the accurate quantification of low-abundant genes such as mmp <dig> 

qpcr was performed on universal reference rna and aa-arna using primer pairs specific for the indicated genes. nd: not detectable. * p =  <dig>  vs rna .

optimized protocol for reverse transcription 
in an attempt to circumvent the loss of sensitivity of qpcr performed with aa-arna, we modified the rt protocol . we introduced a denaturation step  followed by a rapid cool-down on ice and a 2-min incubation at 25°c to improve random hexamers annealing. after addition of reverse transcriptase, a transcription initiation step of  <dig> min at 25°c was performed to improve rt. this step is especially important when the rt is primed by random primers. upon rt completion  and enzyme denaturation , samples were treated with rnase h for  <dig> min at 37°c to digest remaining rna.

protocol optimization improves rt yield
to test rt protocol optimization, we used the universal reference rna either under its native form  or after amplification and amino allyl incorporation . these  <dig> rnas were reverse transcribed either with the original rt protocol, the optimized rt protocol without rnase h treatment, or the optimized rt protocol with rnase h treatment. this dichotomy allowed us to evaluate the effect of rnase h per se. qpcr was performed on resulting cdnas using primer pairs recognizing the  <dig> genes vegfb, mmp <dig>  tfrc, hamp and gapdh. when rna was used as starting material, the optimized rt protocol decreased the mean cq value for the  <dig> genes by  <dig>  cycle  and rnase h treatment did not induce a further decrease of cq value . with aa-arna, the decrease of cq value induced by rt protocol optimization was stronger:  <dig>  cycles were gained . again, rnase h treatment did not further decrease cq values . interestingly, whereas mmp <dig> was below the detection threshold of qpcr assay with aa-arna and the original rt protocol , protocol optimization was able to make it detectable . the same experiment was repeated using rna extracted from blood cells of one brain-dead organ donor and gave similar results: rt protocol modifications induced a gain of  <dig> cycle and  <dig>  cycles when rna and aa-arna were used as inputs, respectively . these results show that optimization of the rt protocol improves the quantity of cdna available for qpcr when working either with rna or aa-arna, with a stronger effect with aa-arna.

rnase treatment improves qpcr efficiency
we next investigated whether the optimized protocol and rnaseh treatment alter rt efficiency and linearity. it was indeed reported that rnase h may allow for amplifying certain genes which may not be accessible to pcr  <cit> . for this purpose, different quantities of aa-arna  were reverse transcribed using either the original or the optimized rt protocol, with or without rnase h treatment. resulting cdnas were diluted 10-fold and subjected to qpcr to determine the efficiency  and the linearity  of the qpcr. figure 5a displays the results of the qpcr for vegfb and figure 5b illustrates e and r <dig> values obtained for the  <dig> genes tested with the different experimental protocols. intersection of dotted lines in graphs of figure 5b indicates the optimal values for e  and r <dig> . a gathering of genes near this optimum reveals an improvement of qpcr parameters. table  <dig> gathers e and r <dig> values for the  <dig> genes, together with statistical analyses. as shown in figure  <dig>  addition of rnase h to the original protocol improved qpcr efficiency for the  <dig> genes tested. when e values from the  <dig> genes were averaged, a significant improvement of e following rnase h treatment was found: from - <dig>  ±  <dig>  to - <dig>  ±  <dig>   when using cdna generated by the original protocol, and from - <dig>  ±  <dig>  to - <dig>  ±  <dig>   when using cdna generated by the optimized rt protocol . e was not significantly improved by the optimized protocol if rnase h treatment was not performed . overall, rt protocol optimization  improved qpcr efficiency from - <dig>  ±  <dig>  to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  . linearity of the qpcr was not statistically significantly affected by the optimized protocol or rnase h . however, protocol optimization and rnase h treatment clearly improved r <dig> for selected genes such as vegfb and hamp .

this table gathers the results obtained from experiments shown in figure  <dig> and shows statistical analyses. p values were determined using one-way repeated measures anova and paired t-test. na: not applicable.

these data show that rnase h treatment improves qpcr efficiency. this result is consistent with previous data  <cit> . considering that rnase h degrades rna paired to cdna after rt, improvement of qpcr parameters by rnase h suggests that rna/cdna duplexes may have prime amplification by taq polymerase, inducing the synthesis of other pcr products than those targeted by the specific qpcr primers. however, the observation that rnase h does not modify cq values  is consistent with a minor effect of rna/cdna duplexes on qpcr outcome. also, fusion curves obtained for each qpcr consistently showed a single peak, attesting for the specificity of the amplification . together with the previous observation that rt protocol optimization improved rt yield and qpcr sensitivity, these results demonstrate that our optimized rt protocol with rnase h treatment provides an optimal cdna from aa-arna to be used in qpcr experiments.

importance of the distance from 3' end in the design of qpcr primers
random hexamers used in traditional rt protocol bind anywhere in the rna, allowing rt of all rna independently of their size. in contrast, the rt of the amplification procedure that generates a aa-arna for microarrays is performed with t <dig> oligo primers that anneal only to the poly tails of mrna. this is an important limitation of this protocol since only mrna below a certain length  may be correctly reverse transcribed, and therefore detectable by qpcr. to address this issue, we designed  <dig> pairs of primers located at different distances from the 3' end of the hif1a gene . these primer pairs had similar ratings as determined by the beacon software used for their design, ruling out the possibility that the differences observed could originate from the primers themselves. hif1a was chosen for these experiments for the length of its coding sequence and the possibility to design 5' pairs of primers evenly distributed on this sequence. cdnas generated from  <dig> μg rna and  <dig> ng aa-arna from universal reference were diluted 10-fold and subjected to qpcr using hif1a primers. as expected, a similar cq value was obtained with the  <dig> pairs of primers when using rna for qpcr, attesting that primer position does not affect cq values when rt is performed with random hexamers . in contrast, moving away primers from the 3' end highly increased cq values when using cdna generated from aa-arna . these results highlight the importance of designing primer pairs close to the 3' end of the gene when working with aa-arna. we suggest designing qpcr primers closer than  <dig> bp away from the 3' end of the target gene when performing qpcr from aa-arna.

primers were designed with the beacon designer software. all pcr products were sequenced to confirm specificity.

validation of microarray results by qpcr using aa-arna
as stated before, the ultimate goal of performing qpcr on aa-arna is to validate microarray results. we therefore tested whether the implementations described in this paper improved this validation. for this purpose, we used aa-arna obtained from blood cells of the same  <dig> brain-dead organ donors described earlier. on one hand, these  <dig> aa-arna were analyzed by genome-wide microarrays. among the  <dig>  genes represented on the microarrays,  <dig> genes were selected based on their significant association with renal graft rejection : the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α , the accessory protein ly <dig>  the neutrophil elastase elane, the adhesion molecule annexin a <dig> , and the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> . expression levels obtained by microarrays were calculated as the log ratio sample vs universal reference rna. on the other hand, expression levels of these genes were assessed by qpcr starting with the same  <dig> aa-arna that were used for microarrays.  <dig> ng of each aa-arna was reverse transcribed either with the original rt protocol or with the optimized rt protocol. the resulting two types of cdna were subjected to qpcr using primers specific for actb, gapdh, ly <dig>  elane, anxa <dig>  stat <dig> and tnf-α. two pairs of primers were used for tnf-α, the first one  located  <dig> bp away from the 3' end of the tnf-α gene and the second one  located  <dig> bp away from the 3' end . figure  <dig> depicts cq values obtained by qpcr: for all genes, cq values were lower when using aa-arna reverse transcribed with the optimized rt protocol compared with the original rt protocol. however, this effect failed to reach statistical significance for ly <dig>  on average, a gain of  <dig>  cycles was afforded by rt optimization . this gain appeared to be independent of the primers position on the gene since some primers are located close to the 3'end  and others are located more distantly . however, the primer position was important in the case of tnf-α since the use of primers distant from the 3' end  prevented the detection of tnf-α in cdna generated with the original rt protocol whereas primers located closely to the 3' end  allowed for tnf-α detection . this result illustrate that designing qpcr primers close to the 3' end is critical for specific target genes. in our search to identify new prognostic markers of graft rejection, the possibility to validate microarray data for tnf-α was important since tnf-α is a main pro-inflammatory cytokine and inflammation influences graft rejection  <cit> . additionally, quantification of low-abundant genes is critical for biomarker studies since biomarkers are often low-abundant proteins encoded by weakly expressed mrnas  <cit> . gapdh was introduced in these analyses to avoid a possible inhibitory effect due to the location of actb primers  and was chosen for normalization in subsequent experiments.

we next determined whether the optimized rt protocol affected the correlation between microarray results and qpcr data. for this purpose, expression levels obtained by qpcr were normalized to gapdh and plotted against expression values obtained by microarrays . linear regression was applied and correlation coefficients r <dig> and p values as determined by the pearson product moment correlation are gathered in table  <dig>  rt protocol optimization did not alter the level of correlation between microarrays and qpcr . correlation coefficients were typically above 68% and flanked with p values below  <dig> , attesting for a significant correlation between microarrays and qpcr data . the strongest correlation was observed for elane  but this was due to one outlier. interestingly, the observation that both qpcr and microarrays reported a high level of elane expression for this outlier argues for the effectiveness of qpcr to validate microarray data. this expression was also particularly elevated when qpcr was performed from un-amplified and un-labelled rna . with respect to tnf-α, we failed to correlate qpcr data with microarrays, even with the optimized rt protocol and qpcr primers chosen close to the 3' end of the gene . this cannot be explained by a low level of expression of tnf-α since cq values obtained by qpcr with tnf-α- <dig> primers were around  <dig> cycles . two transcripts can be generated from the tnf-α gene, a large transcript with  <dig> exons and a smaller transcript having only  <dig> exons. one could have explained the absence of correlation between qpcr data and microarrays if the qpcr primers would have detected a different transcript than the oligonucleotide probe of the microarray. however, both tnf-α- <dig> and tnf-α- <dig> primers, as well as the microarray probe, recognize the large transcript. this result illustrates the difficulty to validate microarrays data by qpcr encountered for some genes, which may consequently be considered as false positives. of note, tnf-α expression values obtained by microarrays did not correlate with qpcr performed on un-amplified and un-labelled rna . overall, the correlation between microarrays and qpcr on aa-arna obtained in our study is comparable to the correlations obtained with rna . therefore, qpcr data obtained from aa-arna are consistent with microarrays and our optimized rt protocol did not affect this correlation.

this table gathers correlation coefficients  and p values estimated by pearson product moment correlation from experiments shown in figure  <dig>  see legend to this figure for details. na: not applicable.

CONCLUSIONS
we have implemented an optimized protocol for the validation of microarrays data by qpcr. this protocol allows using aa-arna leftover from microarray experiments when limited amount of rna is available. it can aid in the quantification of low-abundant genes and provides a significant level of correlation between microarrays and qpcr. in addition, this protocol provides high-quality material that can be used to validate expression of relevant genes that may be highlighted by other approaches than microarrays. such approaches, some of them being increasingly used in the field of biomarker or therapeutic targets discovery, include bioinformatic analysis of functional networks or signaling pathways  <cit> .
