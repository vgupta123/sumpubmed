BACKGROUND
methyl chloride  exists in the atmosphere in large quantities   <cit>  due to its release from specific plants  <cit> , fungi  <cit> , and the burning of biomass  <cit> . methyl bromide  was previously used as a soil fumigant, but its use is presently prohibited because it strongly depletes stratospheric ozone  <cit> . ch3br   <cit>  is also known to originate from oceanic sources  <cit> , terrestrial plants  <cit> , and the burning of biomass  <cit> . thus, ch3cl and ch3br are the primary carriers of natural chloride and bromide to the stratosphere, where they catalyze ozone destruction. compared with ch3cl and ch3br, which have long half-lives in the atmosphere of  <dig>  and  <dig>  years, respectively  <cit> , methyl iodide  has a much shorter half-life of 7- <dig> days  <cit> . however, methylene iodide  has recently been found to affect the formation of marine aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei  <cit> , and iodine oxide  causes ozone loss in the marine boundary layer  <cit> . ch3i , which is the most abundant biogenic methyl halide formed by the ocean  <cit> , is expected to have the same effects as ch2i <dig> and is likely to be a carrier of iodide from the ocean to land. although methyl halides  are simple halogenated compounds that are mainly released from oceanic and terrestrial spheres as well as from anthropogenic sources, specific information about the origins, quantities generated, chemical and biosynthetic mechanisms, and physiological functions of methyl halides remains to be insufficient.

wuosmaa and hager  <cit>  have reported that a chloride methyltransferase  from the marine red alga endocladia muricata can transfer a methyl group from s-adenosyl-l-methionine  to a halide ion as follows:

  

this enzyme has also been found in a variety of organisms including higher plants  <cit> , macro/micro algae  <cit> , and soil bacteria  <cit> . in the same manner, s-adenosylmethionine: halide/thiol methyltransferase  catalyzes the formation of methanethiol  and methyl thiocyanate  in the presence of the bisulfide ion  or thiocyanate ion  as follows  <cit> :

  

  

ch3cl emissions have been reported from specific tropical plants, including certain types of fern, members of the family dipterocarpaceae  <cit>  and salt marsh plants  <cit> . on the other hand, ch3i emissions have been reported from marine algae, such as e. muricata, papenfusiella kuromo, and sargassum horneri   <cit> , pavlova sp.   <cit> , and various soil microorganisms  <cit> . therefore, it can be speculated that different types of hmt/htmt may be present in these organisms.

hmt and htmt genes have been cloned from several higher plants including batis maritima   <cit> , brassica oleracea   <cit> , and arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> . their functions in these plants have been speculated to include salt-tolerance via the emission of methyl halides  <cit> , and detoxification of sulfur compounds produced from the degradation of glucosinolates  <cit> , although their precise roles in vivo remain unclear due to the lack of information available regarding these enzymes.

in this study, the extractable hmt/htmt activity was measured in several agricultural plants as well as coastal trees and grasses. high hmt/mtmt activity was found in specific plants including raphanus sativus , o. sativa , t. aestivum , and cyathea lepifera . moreover, the gene encoding htmt was isolated from r. sativus and expressed in escherichia coli. this paper reports the emission profiles of methyl halides from some plants and the characterization of the enzymatic properties of recombinant r. sativus htmt .

RESULTS
distribution of hmt/htmt activity in higher plants
to examine the distribution of hmt/htmt activity in higher plants, hmt activity in crude extracts from  <dig> higher plants were assayed using the iodide ions . iodide is the most readily methylated ion among hmt/htmt substrates. as shown in table  <dig>  the hmt activity was evaluated in several major agricultural plants, including t. aestivum , o. sativa , zea mays , and saccharum sp.  from the poaceae family, r. sativus and brassica napus l.  from the brassicaceae family, and basella alba 'rubra'  from the basellaceae family. trace activities of less than  <dig> u  were observed in a few coastal plants including arundo donax l. , artemisia fukudo, and suaeda maritima . saini et al.  <cit>  reported in their survey of methyl halides in higher plants that b. napus and r. sativus  have high in vivo hmt activity, b. rubra has medium activity, and z. mays has low activity. the data obtained in the present study were similar to those reported by saini et al., except that in the present study, glaux maritima showed no methyl halide emissions. the present report is the first description of hmt activity in t. aestivum l. , which is a major crop species belonging to the poaceae family. hmt/htmt activity was observed in most members of the poaceae and brassicaceae families but only in a few species outside of these families. in addition, it was found that the ch3cl-producing fern cyathea lepifera  <cit>  possessed hmt activity.

agricultural plants including o. sativa l. , z. mays l. , t. aestivum  thell , b. napus l. , and r. sativus l.  were cultured hydroponically from seeds. in the case of saccharum sp., cut stems were cultured in soil. other plants examined in the survey of hmt/htmt activity were collected from the himi seaside botanical garden  or supplied by local farmers. hmt/htmt activity was assayed with the crude extracts prepared from each plant tissue. no activity was observed in the following plants : agricultural plants: allium sativum l. , allium tuberosum, arctium lappa , calysctegia soldanella, corchorus olitorius, cucumis sativus , daucus carota , dioscorea opposita , elatostema umbellatum var. majus, glycine max l. merr, impomea batatas , zingiber officinale , lactuca sativa, solanum tuberosum , seaside plants: ascostichum aureum l., bruguiera gymnorrhiza l. savigny, chrysanthemum crassum, chrysanthemum pacificum nakai, chrysanthemum shiogiku, glaux maritima var. obtusifolis fern., kandelia candel l. druce, rhizophora stylosa griffith, rubus trifidus thunb, triglochin maritimum, vitex rotundifolia linn. fil., xylocarpus granatum  koenig.

leaves of young r. sativus seedlings  exhibited the highest htmt activity  among the plants tested. the enzymatic properties of the htmt enzyme in r. sativus have not yet been investigated; therefore, r. sativus leaves were used for further enzymatic experiments. the htmt activity of r. sativus was primarily localized in the leaves, with activity in the stem and young roots much weaker, and no activity detected in the mature r. sativus root. in contrast, a similar level of htmt activity was detected in b. campestris l.  roots compared with leaves. attieh et al.  <cit>  have reported that stronger thiol methyltransferase activity was observed in leaves than stems and roots in young seedlings and much weaker activity was found in mature plants in cabbage . on the other hand, athol <dig> of a. thaliana, which is a homologous gene of botmt <dig> in b. oleracea, is ubiquitously expressed during growth and athol <dig> is highly expressed in roots of mature plants  <cit> . these findings suggest that r. sativus has a unique activity profile of htmt compared with other brassicaceae plants.

emission profiles and rates of ch3i from t. aestivum, o. sativa and r. sativus
the emission profiles of ch3i from three plant species were measured . these plants were cultured hydroponically to avoid the effect of soil microorganisms. no ch3i emissions were detected in the absence of i-; however, the emission levels rose in response to increasing concentrations of iodide ions ranging from  <dig> mm to  <dig> mm. this indicates that free i- in water are crucial for the formation of ch3i, and that ch3i emission is affected by iodide concentration. in vivo production of ch3i was observed from t. aestivum, o. sativa and r. sativus when i- were supplied and the formation of ch3sh and dimethyl sulfide  was always detected in gc-ms analyses  in the absence of halide ions. this data concurs with the previous reports by fall et al.  <cit>  and kanda et al.  <cit>  of the emission of sulfur-containing gases including dms from maize, wheat, and rice.

the worldwide areas of rice and wheat cultivation are approximately 140- <dig> ×  <dig> and 210- <dig> ×  <dig> ha, respectively. it is therefore important to evaluate the level of emissions of volatile compounds, such as methyl halides, from these plants and to clarify the mechanism of synthesis of these compounds. the emission rates of ch3i from these plants in the presence of  <dig> mm iodide were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  μg/g fresh leaf per day , and correlated with the observed hmt/htmt activities . the results of this study confirm that methyl halide emissions from rice and wheat plants are dependent on hmt/htmt activity. the slight differences between the emission rates of t. aestivum, o. sativa, and r. sativus and their hmt/htmt activities are probably due to the specific properties of the hmt/htmt in these plants, especially their km values towards i-. saini et al.  <cit>  have reported that ch3i emission from leaf disks of b. oleracea was  <dig>  μg/g fresh leaf per day in the presence of  <dig> mm iodide. this value is comparable with that obtained for r. sativus in this study, although the experimental conditions between the studies differed.

in vivo emission of ch3cl or ch3br from r. sativus was observed when plants were supplemented with cl- or br-, and ch3cl or ch3br was detected in the in vitro reactions using the crude enzyme preparation . however, no emissions of ch3cl or ch3br from t. aestivum and o. sativa were observed in vivo or in vitro due to the low levels of hmt activity in these plants. muramatsu and yoshida  <cit>  first confirmed the emission of ch3i from rice paddies, and redeker et al.  <cit>  also detected emissions of methyl halides, mainly ch3i, from the same ecosystem involving soil, soil microorganisms, and rice plants. more recently, redeker et al.  <cit>  analyzed the methyl halide emissions from rice plants in more detail. a hydroponic system was adopted in the present study so that emissions reflected those of the tested plants alone, and were not affected by the presence of soil microorganisms. the results of the present study, together with the report of an hmt homologue in rice  <cit> , indicate that rice plants produce ch3i through an hmt/htmt reaction, and soil microorganisms mainly play a role in liberating i- from the soil, where it is present as iodate . the mean concentration of iodide in field soil ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> mg/kg in dry soil, and around  <dig> mg/kg dry soil in paddy soil  <cit> . this difference is explained by an increase in the reductive conditions of the paddy when flooded. stable forms of iodate  adsorbed onto the soil matrix may be reduced by microorganisms in flooded paddies to give soluble i-, which could then be taken up through roots and used as an hmt/htmt substrate to form ch3i.

partial purification and anion-specificity of htmt from r. sativus
b. oleracea possesses several isoforms of thiol methyltransferases, which are able to catalyse the sam-dependent methylation of iodide  <cit> . therefore, the existence of htmt isoforms in r. sativus was examined using partial enzyme purification by chromatography. as shown in figure  <dig>  one major bell-shaped htmt activity peak was observed on the chromatogram, and most of the activity in the crude extract was recovered in this peak. this result indicates that the sprouting leaves of r. sativus produce one major htmt isoform. using the crude enzyme preparation of htmt, the substrate specificity towards anions was measured, and compared with that of b. oleracea. as shown in table  <dig>  the enzyme from r. sativus exhibited the highest activity towards - and i-, whereas the activities toward br- and cl- were much lower. the substrate spectrum of htmt was consistent with the in vivo emission rates of methyl halides.

attieh et al.  <cit>  reported that htmt from b. oleracea, which belongs to the same family as r. sativus , is able to methylate i- as well as 2s  and -. because 2s and nash  react chemically with sam to produce small amounts of ch3sh and/or dms, the enzymatic formation of these products was analyzed carefully. it was confirmed that the htmts of r. sativus and b. oleracea possessed sulfide methylating activity towards nash. however, this activity was weak towards 2s . this discrepancy between the present and previous data  <cit>  could be due to differences in the experimental conditions. 2s is not a good substrate to measure the formation of ch3sh by htmts. in order to measure ch3scn or ch3cn production by htmt with kscn or kcn as substrates, the reaction mixture was measured directly by gc-14a gas chromatography because most of the ch3scn or ch3cn was dissolved in water and did not transfer into the gaseous phase. it was found that most of the ch3scn produced by the htmt reaction in r. sativus was converted to ch3sh by an unknown chemical reaction catalyzed by a protein . in addition, it was confirmed that r. sativus exhibited methionine γ-lyase activity that produces ch3sh from methionine. these results indicate that ch3sh is possibly produced through several pathways in r. sativus. however, dms production could not be detected with the htmt reaction from sh- and sam. rhew et al.  <cit>  have reported that the emission of methyl halides by a. thaliana is inhibited by the addition of -. the authors speculated that methyl halide emissions were competitively inhibited by - because this ion is the preferred substrate for htmt in a. thaliana.

cloning and sequence analysis of an htmt coding gene from r. sativus
to investigate the properties of htmt in r. sativus, a full length htmt-encoding gene  was isolated. degenerate pcr was performed to isolate a partial sequence of rshtmt using total rna prepared from sprouting leaves of r. sativus as a template. the pcr product gave a single fragment of  <dig> bp in size. the fragment was cloned into a pta <dig> vector and the nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined. the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence indicated high similarity to hmt/htmt genes of higher plants. in order to isolate the full length rshtmt sequence, 3'/5'-race was performed using several primers designed with reference to this nucleotide sequence, and a single open reading frame  that encoded a htmt was detected in the analyzed nucleotide sequence. the full length nucleotide sequences of the cdna and genomic dna containing rshtmt were obtained by pcr amplification using specific primers.

a comparison of the cdna and genomic sequences revealed that the rshtmt orf contains  <dig> introns. rshtmt encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acid residues, and the deduced amino acid sequence showed a significant similarity to those of higher plant hmts/htmts, which belong to family  <dig> of the methyltransferase superfamily, including b. oleracea botmt <dig> , a. thaliana athol <dig> , b. maritima bmmct , and z. mays sam-dependent methyltransferase  family. the prototypical sam-mt fold is constructed of seven β strands  and six α helices   <cit> , although the β <dig> strand of rshtmt is replaced by an α helix. such structural differences might contribute to the substrate specificity of rshtmt.

enzymatic properties of recombinant rshtmt
to obtain recombinant rshtmt, rshtmt was introduced into e. coli bl <dig>  using the expression vector pet-21b. the recombinant rshtmt was expressed as a histidine- tagged soluble protein in e. coli cells and purified by ni-sepharose resin column chromatography. the purified rshtmt appeared homogenous, as judged by sds-page, and its molecular mass was estimated to be  <dig> kda . this value is close to the molecular mass of  <dig>  kda predicted from the amino acid sequence of rshtmt including the his-tag. the purified protein was characterized and its substrate specificity was determined. the km values of recombinant rshtmt for cl-, br-, i-, -, - and sam were  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm, and  <dig>  mm, respectively, as shown in table  <dig>  the enzyme showed no activity towards cn-. saini et al.  <cit>  reported km values for cl-, br-, i-, -, and sam of b. oleracea thiol methyltransferase of  <dig> mm,  <dig> mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm, and  <dig>  mm, respectively. the values obtained for rshtmt were therefore similar to b. oleracea thiol methyltransferase in terms of methyl acceptor preference: high specificity for i-, -, and -, and low specificity for cl- and br-. purified rshtmt showed a high specificity for -, although much lower activity was found when a crude extract was used to assay the enzyme activity . this discrepancy could be due to the existence of other proteins in the crude extract; however, the precise reason remains unclear. it is known that many enzymes are inhibited in the presence of high concentration of anions, such as bisulfide, thiocyanide, and halide ions  <cit> . attieh et al.  <cit>  reported that the expression pattern of thiol methyltransferases of b. oleracea corresponds to the concentration of glucosinolate. this suggests that rshtmt in r. sativus may be involved in the detoxification of sulfur compounds produced by the degradation of glucosinolates to release them as volatile compounds. the volatile sulfur compounds, including ch3sh and ch3scn and methyl halides, are believed to act as insecticidal or anti-pathogenic agents. therefore, it is speculated that rshtmt in r. sativus plays a role in controlling the levels of anions that can inhibit metabolic enzymes in the leaves and also to protect them from damage caused by insects or pathogens.

kinetic parameters for sam were measured at a constant iodide concentration . parameters for each of the methyl acceptors were measured at constant sam concentration .

CONCLUSIONS
it was found that there is high hmt/htmt activity in the sprouting leaves of r. sativus , t. aestivum , and o. sativa . hmt/htmt activity was responsible for in vivo ch3i emissions from these agricultural plants. the rshtmt gene was cloned successfully and expressed in e. coli cells. the activity data from purified rshtmt suggest that rshtmt may participate in sulfur metabolism in sprouting leaves of r. sativus. the hmt/htmt reaction was found to be involved in the emission of methyl halides or volatile sulfur compounds from higher plants and is key to our understanding of the biogenesis of these compounds in nature.
