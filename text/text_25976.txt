BACKGROUND
the chiroptera is the second largest order of mammals with over  <dig> species  <cit> . it consists of two suborders and five superfamilies  <cit> . although early development has been described for many bat species  <cit> , post-implantation staging systems have been described for only five species from three superfamilies   <cit> . however, an important superfamily of bats, the rhinolophoidea, in the suborder yinpterochiroptera, has not been studied. bats in this superfamily are characterised by the complex structure of their nose-leaves which are associated with echolocation  <cit> . in this paper, we applied the staging system developed by cretekos et al  <cit>  to three bat species, m. schreibersii fuliginosus, h. armiger and h pratti, which belong to the superfamilies vespertilionoidea and rhinolophoidea respectively  <cit> , to investigate whether there are any species specific differences in embryonic development.

m. schreibersii fuliginosus, schreibers's long-fingered bat, is widespread from the temperate zone to the tropics in the old world  <cit> . in the north temperate zone , copulation and fertilization occur in autumn, and implantation and embryonic development are delayed for the duration of hibernation  <cit> . normal embryonic development proceeds after arousal from hibernation in spring and parturition occurs in summer  <cit> .

h. armiger, the great leaf-nosed bat, is widely distributed in subtropical and tropical zones of asia  <cit> . at lower latitudes, this species hibernates from december to february  <cit>  and embryonic development is delayed  <cit> .

h. pratti, pratt's leaf-nosed bat, has been found in a few asian countries and is distributed across the same latitudes as h. armiger  <cit> . although this species was described in  <dig>  <cit> , it has been the subject of few studies and none on reproduction or development.

here we compare morphological changes during embryonic and fetal development for the three bat species, describing the differentiation and development of the face and limbs, and comparing them with information already available for five other bat species. by adding the two hipposiderid species studied in this paper, representatives of another superfamily have been considered .

RESULTS
specimen summary
female m. schreibersii fuliginosus, h. armiger and h. pratti possess bicornuate uteri and are monotocous. h. armiger were in torpor on  <dig> feb  <dig> and  <dig> march  <dig>  on other capture dates, the three species of bats had already aroused. we obtained embryos from  <dig> m. schreibersii fuliginosus in nine stages of development ,  <dig> h. armiger in  <dig> stages  and  <dig> h. pratti in nine stages  and three neonates of m. schreibersii fuliginosus. because they were resected for mrna extraction, the limbs of a few specimens are missing  and some limb information is lacking. table  <dig> shows the capture dates of the female bats and the date on which each stage was dissected for each species. all the prenatal stages in this study occurred between april and june. in all gravid m. schreibersii fuliginosus examined, a fetus was present in the right horn of uterus, whereas in all gravid h. armiger and h. pratti it was in the left horn of uterus. the crown rump length  and uterus diameter  progressively increased during embryonic development .

discussion
for the three species in this study, late embryonic stages and fetal stages were obtained mainly from april to june . embryonic stages of h. armiger captured on  <dig> feb  <dig> and  <dig> march  <dig> were more advanced than those captured on  <dig> april  <dig>   <dig> april  <dig> and  <dig> may  <dig>  that is, nearly all the embryos from the bats captured during torpor  developed faster than those captured after arousal. we captured dozens of h. armiger from the same cave and maintained them for another study. when kept cool during january and february, they became torpid even if food was provided. this suggests that these bats hibernated as did populations of the same species at lower latitudes   <cit> . although accelerated development could be the result of individual variation in the population, it is most likely due to the fact that the bats captured on  <dig> feb  <dig> and  <dig> march  <dig> were artificially aroused from hibernation, kept in an elevated ambient temperature and supplied with food. similar phenomena also occurred in other bat species, including m. schreibersii fuliginosus  <cit> .

as a whole, the organogenetic sequence of bat embryos is uniform and the embryos appear homoplastic before stage  <dig> when the nose-leaf begins to form in some species. there are many common features at the same stage for all the bat species studied, summarized in table  <dig>  the column "common features" contains the key features that can be used to identify the different stages of bat development. when these common features occur, the corresponding stage starts or is in progress. for example, neural tube and somite formation represent the beginning of stage  <dig>  it is difficult to find common features for all eight bat species at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  because some studies did not identify stages strictly according to the staging system developed by cretekos et al  <cit>  and some features occurred earlier or later in c. perspicillata than in other species. in some instances, for example stage  <dig>  the common features are listed as lens vesicles and auditory hillocks. although these terms were not present in the descriptions of all the bat species considered, we listed them for most species in which these features are described.

however, there are also many specific features for each species. besides the crl, ud and somite count, the most profound developmental differences are expected to be in craniofacial development, which is more complex in species possessed of nose-leaves . the earliest differences are evident early in embryonic stage  <dig> when nasal pits are identified. in h. armiger and h. pratti these appear as round depressions, whereas in c. perspicillata they are relatively small and in other species are long grooves. more evident differences of the face start from stage  <dig> when the nose-leaf primordia are formed in h. armiger, h. pratti and c. perspicillata. although h. armiger and h. pratti are phylogenetically close, their nose-leaves develop distinct morphologies. there are four main differences of nose-leaves between these two species. first of all, h. armiger develops four folds on each side of the cheek, whereas h. pratti develops two. secondly, h. pratti develops an evident fold under each eye, whereas h. armiger does not. thirdly, the transverse bilobed shield between the eyes is much larger in h. pratti than in h. armiger. finally, the part of the main fold above nostrils is bigger in h. armiger than in h. pratti. in contrast, m. schreibersii fuliginosus and m. natalensis are also phylogenetically close and their embryonic development and adult morphology are similar.

the eyelids of all eight bat species close before stage  <dig>  but two of them  reopen at embryonic stage  <dig> and the others never open during prenatal development. the uropatagium does not enclose the whole tail in m. rufus and r. amplexicaudatus, but does so in other species. many other differences occur mainly in the timing of organogenesis. for example, the foot plate formed one stage later in h. pratti than in other species. the uropatagium encloses the whole tail later in m. schreibersii fuliginosus, m. natalensis and p. abramus than in c. perspicillata because of the longer tails in the former three species.

CONCLUSIONS
morphological differentiation of bat species is completed prenatally and occurs mainly after embryonic stage  <dig> when a muzzle consisting of the nares, nose-leaves , upper jaw and the lower jaw is formed. our study provides three new bat species for interspecific comparison of post-implantation embryonic development within the order chiroptera and detailed data on the development of nose-leaves for bats in the superfamily rhinolophoidea.
