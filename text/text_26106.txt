BACKGROUND
transposons are naturally occurring mobile genetic elements and have been used as tools to experimentally modify the genomes of a wide range of model organisms. used extensively in insects and plants for decades, recent advances in transposon-based technologies have expanded their use to vertebrate systems. dna-based 'cut-and-paste' transposon systems have been adapted to provide efficient transgenesis tools that can stably integrate an exogenous cargo into the genome without incorporation of plasmid vector sequences. sleeping beauty , a member of the tc1/mariner family of transposable elements, was molecularly reconstructed from an ancient inactive element found in salmonoid fishes  <cit> . sb has been used extensively in the mouse for cancer gene discovery  <cit> , in xenopus for transgenesis  <cit> , and zebrafish for gene and enhancer trap screens  <cit> . the piggybac transposon system from the cabbage looper moth  <cit>  has been shown to efficiently insert into vertebrate  <cit>  and invertebrate genomes  <cit> . most recently, piggybac was used to non-virally integrate key developmental genes to reprogram induced pluripotent stem  cell lines  <cit> .

isolated from the teleost medaka  as the first functional vertebrate autonomous transposase  <cit> , tol <dig> is a member of the hat family  of transposable elements. genetic manipulation of the tol <dig> system has produced a non-autonomous element suitable for transgenesis applications. the non-autonomous tol <dig> element requires active tol <dig> transposase to be supplied in trans for integration of cargo dna flanked by the tol <dig> transposon terminal end repeats into the genome  <cit> . tol <dig> acts as a 'cut-and-paste' transposase integrating its transposable element randomly throughout the genome and creates a characteristic eight  base pair target site duplication  of host genomic dna flanking the integration site. tol <dig> has been successfully used for integration of exogenous dna into zebrafish for transgenesis  <cit>  and enhancer and gene trap strategies  <cit> . previously, we demonstrated that tol <dig> effectively integrates a gfp reporter construct driven by the ubiquitous ef-1α promoter  into the amphibian model organism xenopus tropicalis  <cit> . the tol <dig> transposable element is stable in the xenopus tropicalis genome and is transmitted to progeny at expected mendelian ratios following the f <dig> generation.

once integrated into the genome, tol <dig> non-autonomous transposons can act as substrates for remobilization only in the presence of active tol <dig> transposase  <cit> . methods to re-express the tol <dig> transposase in vertebrates include injection of the tol <dig> transposase mrna directly into one-cell embryos carrying a tol <dig> transposon and by the development of tol <dig> transposase-expressing transgenic lines that can be outcrossed with tol <dig> transposon substrate lines. the transposase injection-based method is time-consuming due to the injection of the transposase mrna directly into individual embryos whereas the breeding-based double-transgenic strategy is potentially more efficient for large-scale remobilization screens. in the zebrafish, resident tol <dig> transposons can be remobilized to novel loci in the presence of the tol <dig> transposase  <cit> . both injection and in vivo expression of the tol <dig> transposase in tol <dig> transposon-haboring animals resulted in novel re-integration events throughout the zebrafish genome  <cit> . remobilized tol <dig> transposons in the zebrafish can result in novel tissue-restricted gfp expression profiles that can be used for the study of organogenesis  <cit> . a recent report from the largaespada laboratory also demonstrates that tol <dig> transposons can be remobilized in the germline of mice  <cit> .

to determine whether re-expression of the tol <dig> transposase can remobilize a transposon present in the xenopus tropicalis genome, we injected tol <dig> transposase mrna into one-cell embryos harvested from transgenic frogs heterozygous for a single tol <dig> transposon and analyzed the developing tadpoles for remobilization. we identified at least one novel integration site in each embryo injected with the tol <dig> transposase mrna. this confirmed that tol <dig> transposons resident in the frog genome are effective substrates for remobilization strategies. to test whether these remobilization events can be transmitted to progeny, we raised tol <dig> transposase injected tadpoles to adulthood and outcrossed the 'remobilized frogs' to wild type animals. progeny from one animal, 12m2♀ <dig>  exhibited a gfp expression pattern not seen in the tol <dig> 12m <dig> transposon line used for injection. analysis of progeny from 12m2♀ <dig> showed germ-line transmission of four novel integration events and that these four integration sites can be independently segregated by outcross. several of these novel integration sites are located within genes suggesting that tol <dig> can potentially target genes for insertional mutagenesis strategies. in addition, we show that the parental tol <dig> integration site is frequently maintained in remobilized progeny suggesting that tol <dig>  like other hat family members  <cit> , catalyzes transposition during cell division. overall, our study provides the first evidence that tol <dig> can remobilize its cognate transposon to novel loci in the genome of xenopus tropicalis and thus provides a powerful genetic tool to manipulate the frog genome for gene and enhancer trapping and insertional mutagenesis.

RESULTS
integration of tol2xig transposons at discrete loci result in different gfp expression patterns
we previously reported the efficient integration and germline transmission of a tol <dig> gfp reporter transposon construct into the genome of the frog xenopus tropicalis  <cit> . in our previous studies, we showed that tol <dig> transposons are stable in the genome and are transmitted at mendelian ratios following the f <dig> generation. preliminary analysis of line 12m had indicated that this founder contained independently-segregating tol2xig transposon alleles  <cit> . sequential outcross of the 12m line resulted in segregation of these alleles to reveal four distinct gfp expression patterns corresponding to four unique integration events in the 12m founder .

injection-mediated tol <dig> transposon remobilization in xenopus tropicalis
to test the ability of a resident tol <dig> transposon to be remobilized in vivo, we performed a pilot injection-based screen using f <dig> progeny derived from two founder lines, 10m and 12m  <cit> . to simplify the subsequent analysis, the f <dig> transgenic parents used for this experiment each harboured a single transposon integration event. xenopus tropicalis embryos at the one-cell stage were injected with  <dig> pg of in vitro transcribed tol <dig> transposase mrna and genomic dna was harvested from individual tadpoles at stage  <dig> . epts lm-pcr was performed to identify the genomic sequence flanking the 5' end of the tol <dig> transposon arm. the results of somatic remobilization of the tol <dig> transposon in two different founder lines, 10m and 12m <dig>  are shown in figure 1b. eighteen individual stage  <dig> tadpoles were analyzed by epts lm-pcr  <cit>  and 100%  of the embryos had at least one new integration site and several tadpoles had multiple, novel integration events. for example, in embryo 10m- <dig>  four integration sites were identified that were different from the parental scaffold  <dig> integration site and each new integration had a unique  <dig> base pair  target site duplication . in addition, re-integration of the tol <dig> transposon was observed in individual embryos on the same scaffold as the parental integration event. genomic dna prepared from embryos 10m- <dig> and 12m- <dig> harboured remobilization events of the tol <dig> transposon on the same scaffold as the parental locus ; and the 12m f <dig> female frog  used in this experiment harbours an integration on scaffold  <dig> ). this indicates that tol <dig>  like other dna 'cut-and-paste' transposases, can catalyze remobilization events that re-integrate near the site of excision, a phenomenon referred to as 'local hopping'. the scaffold identity, revealed by blastn search of the flanking sequence with the xenopus tropicalis genome assembly v <dig> , was "mapped" to the chromosomal assignment by comparing the scaffold number with the list of scaffolds mapped to unique linkage groups on the xenopus tropicalis genetic map . we have adopted the modified xenopus tropicalis chromosome nomenclature described by khokha and colleagues  <cit> . this analysis indicated that, in addition to 'local hopping', re-integration events had occurred throughout the genome. thus, we can conclude that expression of the tol <dig> transposase by microinjection can remobilize a resident tol <dig> transposon in an established founder line. furthermore, we were able to remobilize the tol <dig> transposon substrate in embryos harvested from either male or female heterozygous tol2xig transgenic parents.

analysis of transposase injected tadpoles for germline transmission of remobilized tol <dig> transposons
in a pilot injection-based remobilization experiment we used an f <dig> female, 12m <dig>  that inherited the hbr integration site alone, confirmed by multiple outcrosses, genomic pcr, southern blot and gfp visualization . injected embryos from female 12m <dig> were divided into two pools, one group was harvested for somatic remobilization studies  and the remaining pool was allowed to develop to adult stage. the adult 'remobilized' 12m <dig> f <dig> frogs were outcrossed to wild type animals to determine whether the remobilized transposons are passed through the germline.

seven gfp-positive f <dig> 'remobilized' adults were successfully out-crossed to wild type frogs to test for germline transmission of remobilized tol <dig> transposons . due to the mosaic nature of transgenic founder  animals derived from the co-injection of transposon plasmid substrate and synthetic tol <dig> mrna, we anticipated that remobilization by injecting tol2xig transgenic embryos with tol <dig> transposase mrna would result in mosaic animals. this is due to the ability of tol <dig> to catalyze remobilization events in discrete blastomeres during the early stages of development, and thus the resulting animal, and its germline, is likely to be mosaic for the parental and novel tol2xig transposon integration events. to examine this, we analyzed tissues from an adult remobilized animal  that had died following outcross. integration site analysis was performed on genomic dna prepared from multiple tissues to verify the mosaic nature of the injection-mediated remobilization products. novel re-integration events were identified in discrete somatic tissues of this animal. epts lm-pcr confirmed at least two remobilization events in genomic dna isolated from the right lung . interestingly, the integration site into scaffold  <dig> is on chromosome 5/lg  <dig>  the same chromosome as the hbr parental integration site. analysis of progeny obtained from animal 12m2♀ <dig> show no germline remobilization . likewise, integration site analysis of genomic dna harvested from the left and right ovaries indicated no evidence for remobilization in the germline . this result confirms remobilization of the resident transposon in somatic tissues, consistent with our earlier studies , but that remobilization events occurred in a blastomere leading to formation of the right lung and not in the germline.

* four novel remobilization events have been identified in progeny from 12m2♀ <dig> .

characterization of f <dig> progeny from remobilized founder 12m2♀5
visual examination of all offspring derived from the outcross of the 'remobilized' 12m <dig> adults showed that most of the progeny have the same expression pattern of gfp as the hbr founder  of the progeny from the initial outcross of 12m2♀ <dig> had gfp expression visible in the kidneys  compared to gfp positive siblings without expression in the kidney . approximately 49%  of the 12m2♀ <dig> outcross was gfp-positive but lacked reporter expression in the kidney. gfp expression in the kidney was not observed in other lines derived from founder 12m . outcross of the 'donor' female 12m <dig> with a wild type xenopus tropicalis male produced embryos containing only the hbr locus with no gfp expression within the kidney . the visual examination was confirmed by pcr and southern analyses and showed that the 12m <dig> frog contained only the hbr allele. we therefore concluded that the 'kidney-positive' population represented progeny containing a novel remobilization event.

additional outcross of xenopus tropicalis 12m2♀ <dig> produced tadpoles with different gfp expression levels . southern blot analysis  was performed on genomic dna prepared from individual tadpoles and indicated the presence of novel bands due to remobilization events. we identified numerous embryos with gfp-positive southern blot banding patterns that were different from the parental hbr locus . epts lm-pcr  was performed on individual embryos exhibiting unique southern blot profiles. pcr amplification of sequences flanking the tol2xig transposon in the tadpoles harbouring novel insertion sites confirmed that remobilization had occurred . the epts lm-pcr products were cloned and sequence analysis revealed novel integration sites that differ from the parental hbr allele . genomic pcr using primers designed to the corresponding scaffold sequence outside the cloned epts lm-pcr product confirmed the integration site and was further verified by pcr cloning the transposon-genomic flanking sequence on the other side of the tol2xig transgene. we have identified four independently-segregating remobilization events from 12m2♀ <dig> and named them jovan heat , centaure , brut , and follique . examples of the gfp expression pattern for each of these new integration sites in developing tadpoles is depicted in figure 3b.

integration site analysis determined that embryos that have high-levels of gfp in the pronephric kidney contained a transposon that had integrated into the genomic locus of a putative gene encoding a novel heat motif-containing protein . the heat motif forms repetitive helical structures common to huntington protein, elongation factor  <dig>  pp2a  and tor   <cit> , so we have named this tol <dig> remobilization event jovan heat . the integration site is  <dig> base pairs downstream of exon  <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of exon  <dig> of this predicted thirteen exon gene. the joh integration event occurred in the 3'-end of a predicted heat motif-containing protein, however, in situ hybridization  <cit>  with antisense rna probes for this gene did not exhibit robust expression in the developing kidney . the nearest flanking gene downstream of the joh integration site is hnf1β, a gene that is highly expressed in the developing xenopus kidney  and is a likely candidate for the gene driving the gfp expression pattern observed in joh. this data indicates that the gene closest to the transposon integration site may not be responsible for the observed gfp expression pattern as the minimal ef-1α promoter in the tol2xig transposon may be influenced by regulatory elements of more distal flanking genes.

the second remobilization event, follique , occurred in scaffold 98: <dig>  approximately  <dig> kb away from the parental hbr locus and represents a 'local hopping' event. here, tol <dig> has integrated immediately adjacent to the first exon ) of the predicted xenopus tropicalis methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase  1-like  gene. the mthfd1l enzyme is important in folate metabolism and is required for purine synthesis during embryogenesis and rapid cell growth  <cit> . polymorphisms of mthfd1l in humans are associated with disease susceptibility and embryonic abnormalities including neural tube defects  <cit> . the proximity of the tol <dig> integration site to the transcription start site of this mrna suggests that this integration may be mutagenic; a hypothesis that will be tested in the future by incross of heterozygous animals bearing single tol2xig fol alleles.

the centaure  allele results from a tol <dig> remobilization into scaffold 15: <dig> within a  <dig> kb intron of the predicted centaurin-γ- <dig> gene locus that encodes a large multi-domain arfgap membrane protein that contains ankyrin repeats and a pleckstrin homology domain  <cit> .

epts lm-pcr clones of the brut  allele contain repetitive sequences that align with repeat elements in scaffold  <dig>  here, the tol2xig re-integration site is within the genomic locus of a predicted gene encoding a member of the trci  family of transposases  <cit> . analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicates that most of the putative xttrci protein shares a high degree of homology to trcs in zebrafish, sea urchin, drosophila, mosquito, hydra and fluke, and is completely conserved in the transposase domains.

to determine whether excision of the tol2xig transposon from the parental locus resulted in a footprint, that is, the modification of the endogenous locus, we performed genomic pcr of the endogenous locus with primers that flank the hbr integration site on scaffold  <dig>  the sequence of the pcr products from multiple tadpoles was identical to the wild type locus indicating that the excision reaction resulted in the precise removal of the tol <dig> transposon with no apparent modification of the locus . we also examined genomic dna samples from the somatic remobilization experiments and were unable to detect modifications caused by excision of the tol <dig> element .

to determine the percentage of the progeny from 12m2♀ <dig> that inherit either the parental  allele or the four novel remobilized alleles  we sorted embryos into gfp-positive and gfp-negative populations and then randomly selected  <dig> gfp-positive tadpoles for analysis. each tadpole was photographed and genomic dna was prepared for molecular analyses. the genotype of each animal was determined by southern blot and verified using genomic pcr. the data from this random sampling is shown in table  <dig>  approximately 78%  of the gfp-positive population from outcross of 12m2♀ <dig> harbour the parental hbr allele alone. the remaining 22%  contained combinations of individual integration events  or combination of two, or more, integrations . in this randomly selected sample of  <dig> embryos we failed to identify tadpoles containing only the fol integration site, however, this individual allele was found in other outcrosses of 12m2♀ <dig> . this data suggests that 22% of gfp-positive embryos from 12m2♀ <dig> contain at least one novel remobilization event.

* embryos containing the fol integration site in isolation were observed in additional outcrosses.

maintenance of the joh integration site in the genome of f <dig> xenopus tropicalis embryos
embryos from the outcross of 12m2♀ <dig> were sorted based on their gfp expression pattern and tadpoles with the kidney pattern were raised to adults for subsequent outcross . to assess whether the new remobilization events are stable in the genome and that, in the absence of tol <dig> transposase activity, the novel integration events are inherited at the expected mendelian frequencies, progeny from the outcross of two individual f <dig> males derived from 12m2♀ <dig>  were scored for gfp expression patterns and genomic dna samples prepared from the f <dig> tadpoles were analyzed by pcr and southern blotting. these analyses indicated that the remobilized alleles are inherited at the expected mendelian frequencies and were stable in the genome .

discussion
tol <dig> transposons can be remobilized in xenopus tropicalis
our previous studies demonstrated that tol <dig> is an efficient system for generating transgenic xenopus tropicalis  <cit> . here, we show that tol <dig> transposons stably integrated into the frog genome are efficient substrates for remobilization following re-expression of the tol <dig> transposase enzyme. analysis of genomic dna harvested from transgenic embryos injected at the one-cell stage with tol <dig> transposase mrna revealed that remobilization was very efficient. one hundred percent of injected transgenic animals showed novel re-integration events and we demonstrate that remobilization can be achieved in the progeny of transgenic male or female founders. analysis of organs from an adult 'remobilized' frog indicated that the animals produced by the transposase mrna injection technique are highly mosaic. the mosaic nature of the remobilization events is likely due to the stochastic activity of the tol <dig> enzyme in the rapidly dividing xenopus embryo. messenger rna encoding the transposase is injected at the one-cell stage and it is likely to take some time to accumulate sufficient tol <dig> protein to catalyze the remobilization events. during this time, early cleavage stages may have occurred resulting in random remobilization events in different blastomeres of the developing embryo. the mosaic nature of the somatic remobilization events is reflected by the mosaic germline transmission of the re-integrated transposons. we demonstrated that the remobilized transposons can be passed through the germline of the injected transgenic frog and that these remobilized transposons are stable in the genome in the subsequent generations. the transmission of transposons through the germline of remobilized frogs frequently resulted in non-mendelian inheritance of the gfp transgene in the resulting progeny . outcross of remobilized f <dig> animals was predicted to have resulted in the expected mendelian segregation of the dominant gfp allele, that is 50% gfp-positive and 50% gfp-negative. several of the outcrosses yielded transmission frequencies that were not significantly different from the expected rate of gfp-positive progeny . genomic pcr analysis and southern blot analysis indicated that only the parental  allele is present in the progeny of these animals indicating that remobilization has not occurred . in other outcrosses the observed rate of transmission of the reporter to the progeny was significantly different from the expected rate . the variation in the expected rate of transgenesis may be due to the mosaic nature of the remobilization reaction following injection of the tol <dig> transposase mrna at the one-cell stage. for example, if the transposition reaction results in excision, but not re-integration, of the parental transposon in discrete blastomeres that will give rise to the germline, then a transmission rate lower than 50% may be anticipated. for example, progeny from founder line 12m2♀ <dig> are  <dig> % positive for gfp, suggesting a loss of gfp by excision but not reinsertion of the tol <dig> transposon. it is also possible that remobilization has occurred in the germline of 12m2♀ <dig> line but the novel insertion event has disrupted a genomic locus causing a loss of gfp positive embryos. subsequent pcr and southern blot analysis for the 12m2♀ <dig> line, however, has failed to detect any evidence for transposon re-integration in this line . finally, a third class of outcross embryos was identified from the 'remobilized' 12m <dig> adults. frogs 12m2♀ <dig>  12m2♂ <dig> and 12m2♂ <dig> each produced gfp-positive tadpoles at a rate significantly higher than that expected for the outcross of a dominant heterozygous allele. detailed analysis of the progeny from 12m2♀ <dig> demonstrated that multiple remobilization events had occurred in the germline of this frog and were passed on to the offspring. to date, we have been unable to identify novel integration sites by pcr strategies and southern blot analysis in the progeny from founder lines 12m2♂ <dig> and 12m2♂ <dig> , even though population numbers suggest tol <dig> remobilization is occurring in these lines.

the germline of remobilized f <dig> frog 12m2♀ <dig> was highly mosaic and contained four novel integration events in addition to the parental  transposon. approximately 22% of the gfp-positive progeny from this animal contained novel remobilization events. this indicates that the germline of this frog is mosaic for the transposon insertions, and as discussed above, likely resulted from random remobilization events occurring during early cleavage stages in the development of the 12m2♀ <dig> tadpole.

the different inheritance frequencies of the remobilized alleles suggest that the remobilization events occurred at different times during the development of the transposase-injected embryo 12m2♀ <dig>  it is likely that the joh re-integration event occurred first as this is the remobilized allele most commonly seen in the outcross population. the cen allele is the next most commonly found allele and thus likely occurred after the joh remobilization event. the fol allele is commonly found with the cen allele indicating that the fol remobilization event most likely occurred in a blastomere derived from a prior cen remobilization event. as the bru allele is only seen either alone or with the parental hbr allele, this suggests that this remobilization event occurred in a blastomere that was not targeted by the other remobilization events . this data clearly demonstrates that tol <dig> transposons integrated into the xenopus tropicalis genome are effective substrates for remobilization and the re-integration events are passed through the germline. expression of the tol <dig> transposase in early developing embryos results in random remobilization events and the germline of the resulting adult is mosaic for the parental and remobilized transposon transgenes.

the most striking feature of the progeny that resulted from this outcross was the presence of multiple alleles of the tol2xig transposon in the same tadpole. the f <dig> frog that this line was derived from, 12m <dig>  contained a single tol <dig> transposon integration event, hbr . how does a transposase that uses a simple 'cut-and-paste' transposition mechanism result in an increase in the number of transposon alleles in individual progeny? as with the mosaic nature of the remobilized frogs, the answer likely lies in the rapid development of the early xenopus embryo and the propensity of hat elements to mobilize during cell division  <cit> . the xenopus embryo divides rapidly and synchronously for the first twelve cell cycles that are simple s  and m  phases with no g  phases. if tol <dig> catalyzes remobilization of the resident tol2xig transposon in a blastomere after dna synthesis but prior to mitosis, then, following random segregation of the sister chromatids, the resulting blastomere may inherit both the parental allele and the remobilized allele . subsequent rounds of cell division and tol <dig> enzymatic activity may further increase the complexity of the transposon content of an individual blastomere. if this blastomere gives rise to a germ cell, then the resulting gametes produced by this cell could contain multiple copies of the transposon transgene .

potential uses for tol <dig> remobilization strategies in the frog
transposons offer efficient mechanisms for generating transgenic xenopus. the established strategy for generating novel transgenic lines using transposon systems involves injected embryos at the one-cell stage with a cocktail containing a plasmid harbouring a transposon substrate and synthetic mrna encoding the corresponding transposase enzyme. micro-injection of plasmid dna is toxic to the developing embryo and thus limits the amount of substrate that can be provided for the transposition reaction. remobilization of transposons already integrated in the genome thus offers an attractive alternative to the co-injection approach. as illustrated in the examples shown here, the tol2xig transposon can act as an enhancer trap and remobilization of the transposon to novel loci can result in unique gfp expression profiles. another potential benefit of the remobilization strategy is to take advantage of the 'local hopping' phenomenon to generate mutations in genes near the primary integration site. dna 'cut-and-paste' transposons preferentially re-integrate at loci near the initial integration site. for example, remobilization of sleeping beauty transposons in the germline of mice results in approximately 50-80% of the re-integration events occurring within  <dig> cm either side of the primary integration site  <cit> . the 'local hopping' phenomenon has also been observed with tol <dig> in several vertebrate species. in this study, we show several examples of re-integration of the tol2xig transposon to the same sequence scaffold as the initial transposition event in xenopus tropicalis. 'local hopping' of remobilized tol <dig> transposons in the zebrafish germline has recently been reported by both the kawakami and korzh laboratories  <cit> . in mice, remobilization of resident tol <dig> transposons in the germline frequently results in re-integration near the donor site  <cit> .

small-scale micro-injection based enhancer trap screens will be performed in the frog where novel patterns are scored in the progeny of remobilized animals and the flanking sequences are cloned to reveal the nearby genes. the soul patch  transgenic line will be ideal for remobilization studies, as excision of the transposon from this locus and re-integration at a novel site will likely change the unique gfp expression pattern observed in this line . the rate-limiting step in this approach is the micro-injection technique, and future efforts will be directed at the generation of transgenic frogs that express the tol <dig> transposase in the xenopus germline. the enzyme-expressing frogs can then be crossed with substrate transposon-harbouring frogs to generate double transgenic animals that have inherited both the enzyme and the substrate for remobilization. outcross of these double transgenic frogs will result in progeny with novel expression patterns and remove the necessity for the micro-injection step. this double-transgenic  remobilization approach has been used with success in both zebrafish and mice  <cit> . the advantage of pursuing this strategy in xenopus tropicalis is the remarkable fecundity of this species, clutch sizes routinely surpass  <dig>  embryos, and the longevity of the frogs, adult animals may live for twenty years or more in captivity. combined with the exquisite embryological advantages of the xenopus system, transposon-mediated gene and enhancer trap screening in the frog will provide an excellent combination of modern molecular genetics in a highly tractable developmental system.

CONCLUSIONS
tol <dig> transposons stably integrated into the xenopus tropicalis genome are substrates for remobilization
transposon transgenesis techniques offer several advantages over other techniques for manipulating the frog genome. the 'cut-and-paste' mechanism of transposase enzymes such as tol <dig> results in no plasmid vector sequences being integrated along with the transgene. the integrated transposons are also efficient substrates for excision and re-integration at novel sites. this has at least two important implications. first, as described above, the integrated transposon can be remobilized to perform gene and enhancer trap screens. second, if integration of the transposon into a locus results in a mutant phenotype, the transposon can be remobilized from that site in order to rescue the phenotype and establish a direct link between the integration event and the mutation. in this manuscript, we demonstrate that tol <dig> transposons integrated in the frog genome are effective substrates for remobilization.

remobilized tol <dig> transposons are transmitted through the germline
micro-injection of mrna encoding the tol <dig> transposase into one-cell tol <dig> transgenic embryos results in the mosaic remobilization of the transposon from the parental locus. this is likely due to random remobilization in discrete blastomeres during early embryonic development. in order for these remobilization events to be passed through the germline, the enzymatic activity must occur in blastomeres fated to contribute to the germ cells. we demonstrated that remobilized transposons are indeed transmitted through the germline of remobilized tol <dig> transgenic frogs that had been injected at the one-cell stage with tol <dig> mrna. the presence of multiple tol <dig> transposons in individual progeny from a 'remobilized' frog, that was derived from a founder with a single integration event, indicates that the remobilization events have occurred in the developing blastomeres after s phase but prior to mitosis. the remobilization events are stable in the genome and can be segregated by serial outcross of the remobilized transgenic parent. the demonstration of efficient remobilization of tol <dig> transposons in the xenopus tropicalis genome is an important step in the development of transposon-based gene and enhancer trap screens in this tractable developmental model organism.
