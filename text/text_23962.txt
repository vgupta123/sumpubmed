BACKGROUND
biological systems comprise complex sets of biophysical, biochemical and cellular processes occurring at multiple temporal and spatial scales. the strong coupling of those scales, as well as the circular nature of causality in these systems  <cit> , calls for the forging of new methods to explain emerging processes, notably by combining experimental data acquired at those different scales.

the immunological response appears like a promising test case in this respect because of its inherent complexity, and its large experimentalist community providing an ever-increasing level of experimental evidences, driving the modeling process.

continuous models have been widely used to study immunological phenomena by simulating how average densities or concentrations of immune system agents  are changing over time and by identifying critical parameters that regulate the immune response. although useful in simulating average responses of the immune system, it is difficult for continuous models to access the behavior of individual agents, in response to variations in parameters such as the duration of t cell and antigen-presenting cells  interaction  <cit> , t cell cycling time  <cit>  or intercellular interactions  <cit> , that influence t cell responses.

individual-based models are capable of coupling cell behaviors  with spatial concerns  and of yielding information on emerging population dynamics. for example, models have been developed to investigate the motility of t cells and cellular contact between t cells and apcs  <cit> , t cell strategy to search for antigens  <cit>  or lymph node output efficiency  <cit> . one important advantage of individual-based modeling approaches is that it allows incorporating quantitative characterization of the processes at the single-cell level. however, most of existing models neglect the intracellular mechanisms of cell decisions, hence limiting their explanatory power.

baldazzi et al.  <cit>  developed a hybrid model depicting lymphocyte recruitment and trafficking inside the lymph node, by coupling a stochastic agent-based description of cell interactions with a molecular diffusion described by partial differential equations . nevertheless, this model does not incorporate intercellular mechanisms controlling cells behavior but rather allows cells to sense and behave according to the concentration of specific chemokines in the surroundings. another hybrid model was proposed by santoni et al.  <cit>  for describing t cell differentiation in the ige-mediated hypersensitive reaction. at the intracellular level, this model comprises a genetic regulatory network  for translating local cytokine signals  into explicit differentiation phenotype  through the activation of the represented genes . at the cellular scale, the intracellular regulatory network is individually embedded in each cd4+ t cell using an agent-based model. the simulation result was able to reproduce cell population dynamics during a type i hypersensitivity reaction  <cit> , however it could not generate realistic gene/protein expression profiles out of the intracellular network  <cit> .

in the last decade, different models and tools  have been developed in an attempt to integrate processes across multiple scales and data from different resources  in order to explain immune responses. to further our understanding of the cd8+ t cell immune response, we have been modeling the cd8+ t cells behavior. we aimed at uncovering potential mechanisms and the impact of parameters that may help to explain some experimental observations, such as the responses of cd8+ t cells to different activation conditions. since cell behavior, intracellular signaling and extracellular environment are inter-connected dynamical processes, an integration of these dynamics into a single platform requires multiscale modeling. importantly, this type of models should produce quantitative simulation results that can recapitulate as well as explain a biological phenomenon at multiple scale levels  <cit> .

in the present work, we aim at modeling how, in response to acute influenza virus infection, antigen-specific naïve cd8+ t cells become activated in the secondary lymphoid organs, rapidly proliferate and differentiate into effector lymphocytes that mediate viral clearance  <cit> . cd8+ t cells express t cell receptor  molecules on their surface that can recognize peptides derived from antigenic proteins bound to the products of the major histocompatibility complex  on apcs . when encountering cognate antigen-bearing apcs, cd8+ t cells reduce their rate of motility and eventually form prolonged contacts with apcs  <cit> , which are accompanied by the engagement of the tcr by peptide-mhc complexes. tcr engagement induces the synthesis of interleukin- <dig> , which plays crucial roles in the growth and differentiation of cd8+ t cells  <cit> . upon activation through signals delivered by the tcr and costimulatory molecules, t cells upregulate il- <dig> receptor chains , i.e. il-2-rα , il-2rβ  and il-2rγ , and become highly sensitive to il- <dig>  <cit> . secreted il- <dig> binds il-2r  to deliver a key signal for cd8+ t cell activation  <cit> . in the presence of strong antigenic stimulation, cd8+ t cells are able to produce sufficient il- <dig> for activation and proliferation  <cit> .

in a different context, it has been shown that the proliferation of cd8+ t cells with a weak tcr stimulus requires il- <dig> supplement, and t cell sensitivity to il- <dig> strongly affects the extent of proliferation  <cit> . it is unknown how il- <dig> sensitivity regulates cd8+ t cells behavior in the lymph node environment, where activated cd8+ t cells are influenced by the extra-cellular signals  as well as by interactions with apcs  and other cell types, justifying the use of multiscale models for exploring these processes.

finally, it has been observed that cd8+ t cells detach from apcs and undergo rapid proliferation after successful activation in vivo  <cit> . some studies have demonstrated that the t cell-apc contact duration affects the quality and magnitude of an immune response  <cit>  and memory t cell development  <cit> . several studies have identified factors that influence t cell-apc contact duration including the maturation state of apcs  <cit> , chemokines  <cit>  and adhesion molecules   <cit> . clearly, cd8+ t cell activation correlates with t cell-apc contact duration. however, it is still not clear how il- <dig> influences t cell-apc contact duration.

we previously proposed a multiscale model  <cit>  that qualitatively reproduces early cd8+ t cell immune responses in murine lymph nodes. at the intracellular level, the model comprises a set of ordinary differential equations  describing the dynamics of a molecular regulatory network driving cd8+ t cell activation and differentiation. the intracellular processes are embedded in single cd8+ t cells and determine the cell phenotype through the dynamical functioning of the molecular regulatory network. at the cellular level, cd8+ t cells are described within a cellular potts model  <cit> . cells sense signals via surface receptor-ligand binding, involving either a direct cell-cell contact or diffusive molecules that are secreted by neighboring cells. here, we use this model to address “how and how much molecular inputs and the microenvironment can affect the behavior at the population level.”  <cit> .

we first calibrate the model parameters based on in vivo data. by mimicking acute infections, our model simulations quantitatively reproduce the cd8+ t cell population dynamics in murine lymph nodes as well as the dynamics of some key intracellular signals associated with cd8+ t cell activation and differentiation. in addition, using the same parameter values, our model proves to be able to reproduce another experimental situation for which it had not been designed: cd8+ t cell responses to weak antigenic stimulations with different concentrations of il- <dig> supplement. the multiscale nature of the model allows to understand how different cellular responses might emerge from subtly different intracellular profiles, by linking the observation of transient short-term molecular events to long-term cell population dynamics. finally, we show that cd8+ t cells-apc productive contact duration  is influenced by a balance between exogenous il- <dig> availability and cd8+ t cell intrinsic il- <dig> sensitivity, highlighting experimentally testable model-based predictions.

RESULTS
reproducing early cd8+ t cell immune response in murine lymph nodes
in order to refine the parameter values of our model, previously obtained in  <cit> , we assessed its ability to reproduce two types of data generated at two different scales within 72–120 h post infection  time frame:molecular data available through the immgen database  and

cellular data consisting in the count of f <dig> transgenic cells in the lymph nodes of mice infected with influenza virus .

regarding the molecular behavior of our model, we observed that the average concentrations of il- <dig> and il-2r in the simulated cell population increase sharply in few hours post-infection . around 78 h pi, a high level of il-2•il-2r  appears in the simulations, which drives some pre-activated cd8+ t cells into the activation state . following the emergence of pre-activated cells in the simulations, t-bet expression increases and peaks around 88 h pi at the population level . with expansion of effector cells in the simulated populations, an increase in cellular contacts  elevates the frequency of fas-fasl engagement which leads to an upregulation of fas* , and the consequent cleavage/activation of caspases .

regarding the cellular behavior of our model, the simulated cd8+ t cell population dynamics exhibits a pattern similar to the in vivo data , where cell proliferation starts at about 90 h pi, and then displays an exponential growth. due to asymmetric partition of t-bet between daughter cells, effector phenotypes appear soon after the first t cell division . around 96 h pi, effector cd8+ t cells dominate the population in the simulations . cell death appears sporadically following the emergence of effector cells and becomes frequent at later simulation points .

overall, our model succeeds in reproducing the expected dynamics of cd8+ t cells in murine lymph nodes, at both the molecular and cellular scales. importantly, it explains the cellular phenomena by generating in silico kinetics of the molecular species that match the in vivo data . in addition, the model also makes some predictions such as the evolution of the proportion of the different cell types in a draining lymph node  or the evolution of the cleaved form of caspase , as a function of time.

parameter sensitivity  analyses indicate a robust performance of this model in reproducing the in vivo responses of cd8+ t cells to influenza virus infections. for example, small deviations of the t-bet or caspase threshold values  do not significantly impair the simulation results . on the opposite, the il-2•il-2r threshold has a strong influence on the size of the total cell population and on the intracellular molecular dynamics  , indicating that the sensitivity of cd8+ t cells to il- <dig> is an important factor regulating their responses.

exogenous il- <dig> concentration and endogenous il- <dig> sensitivity modulate the response of cd8+ t cells to weak tcr stimulation
the above simulation results illustrate 1) that with proper parameterization, our model is able to simulate the early phases of cd8+ t cell immune responses to strong antigens; 2) how the activation of naïve cd8+ t cells is induced by autocrine il- <dig> production that results from strong tcr engagement; and 3) the process of effector cells development. we then wondered to which extent this model could reproduce other immunological conditions, for which it was not pre-parameterized. we decided to assess our model’s ability to reproduce part of the data reported by cho et al.  <cit> , which showed that with weak tcr signals induced by soluble cd <dig> monoclonal antibodies , il- <dig> synthesis by cd8+ t cells is deficient and the presence of exogenous il- <dig> is necessary for their activation and proliferation. in addition, the reactivity of cd8+ t cells to il- <dig> has a good correlation with their cd <dig> expression, i.e., in vitro proliferative responses to il- <dig> were stronger for cd5hi cells than cd5lo cells  <cit> . to further understand these phenomena at different scales as well as to test if our molecular network could mimic the in vitro il-2-dependent proliferation of cd8+ t cells, we performed a set of in silico experiments  based on the wet-lab experiments implemented in  <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic diagram of in silico experiments designed to test with our model cd8+ t cells productive responses to a weak tcr stimulation plus il- <dig> supplement implemented in  <cit> 



to simulate the response of cd8+ t cells to exogenous il- <dig> under the antigen-free condition, we removed apcs from the computational domain and supplied naïve cells with il- <dig> . unsurprisingly, at the population level neither cell activation nor proliferation is observed with or without il- <dig> supplement , which is in good agreement with the in vitro data  <cit> . at the intracellular level, no change in molecular expression is observed in the antigen-free simulations , which explains the absence of cellular response.fig.  <dig> cd8+ t cell dynamics in various antigenic stimulation environments in silico. a only the control population  and the population submitted to a weak antigenic stimulation together with additional il- <dig> supplement are able to proliferate . b cd8+ t cell dynamics in a weak antigenic condition with graded doses of il- <dig> supplement  . c il-2•il-2r expression  and d the activated cells fold-increases  under the conditions of weak antigenic stimulation with or without 10 ng/ml il-2



to test the response of cd8+ t cells to a weak tcr stimulation, instead of providing the simulated cells with soluble cd <dig> mab as described in  <cit> , we loaded the apcs in our model with weak antigens aiming to mimic the low tcr signal strength . to this end, we simulated transient cellular contacts between naïve cd8+ t cells and weak-antigen-loaded apcs  based on the finding that stable t cell-apc interactions are antigen dependent  <cit> . this situation mimics in vivo homeostatic proliferation. we observe that with weak antigenic stimulation, proliferation of the cd8+ t cells is negligible in the absence of external il- <dig> supplement . likewise, no cell proliferation is observed in the simulations supplemented with less than  <dig>  ng/ml il- <dig> . this is in agreement with observations that proliferative responses of naïve cd8+ t cells in the context of weak tcr ligation depend on il- <dig>  both in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo. up to that stage, our model is then able to reproduce non-straightforward in vitro biological observations for which it had not been parameterized.

by contrast, a relative stronger proliferative response occurs when supplying the simulation domain with 3 ng/ml il- <dig> or higher , as highlighted in vitro by cho et al.  <cit> . by comparing the intracellular dynamics of cd8+ t cells stimulated by weak antigens with and without il- <dig> supplement , a transient high level of il-2•il-2r complex arising from il- <dig> addition is captured at early simulation time points . in fact, this transient peak of il-2•il-2r is sufficient to drive some naïve cd8+ t cells into the activation state  and then leads to a subsequent activation and proliferation of cd8+ t cells, observable several hours later. given the fast decay rate of il- <dig> in vivo , successful activation with weak tcr stimulation requires that naïve cd8+ t cells encounter apcs at early time points so that they can up-regulate il-2r before the il- <dig> concentration in the surrounding environment becomes insufficient. hence, our modeling approach highlights molecular mechanisms explaining why exogenous il- <dig> is the key for the proliferative responses of cd8+ t cells to a low tcr signal induced by weak antigens in vivo. it thereby explains the in vitro cd8+ t cell proliferation induced by a weak tcr stimulation with il- <dig> supplement, thus reproducing and explaining biological observations it had not been designed to describe.

naïve cd8+ t cells display different il- <dig> sensitivities in vitro; this is correlated with cd <dig> expression: cd5hi cd8+ t cells are highly sensitive to il- <dig> compared to cd5lo cd8+ t cells  <cit> . to further examine the role of il- <dig> signaling in controlling cd8+ t cells response to weak antigens, we modeled the responses of cd5lo cells and cd5hi cells by setting the required threshold for il-2•il-2r-induced cell activation at different levels  for cd5lo cells and low il-2•il-2r-threshold  for cd5hi cells) . simulation results show that cells with a low il-2•il-2r-threshold give rise to larger populations than cells with a high il-2•il-2r-threshold . qualitatively, these simulation results are in excellent agreement with in vitro simulated homeostatic proliferations shown in  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> sensitivity of cd8+ t cells to il- <dig> correlates with the strength of proliferation response in the context of weak tcr stimulation. a simulation results: proliferative responses of il-2•il-2r-threshold-low and -high cd8+ t cells to graded doses of il- <dig> supplement  with a weak antigenic stimulation  or in antigen-free conditions  . total cd8+ t cell counts are measured at 120 h pi. b in vitro results : in vitro proliferation of b <dig> naïve cd5lo and cd5hi cd8+ t cells to a low concentration of soluble cd <dig> mab  with or without graded concentrations of il- <dig> supplement 



even though cd <dig> levels of cd8+ t cells have been shown to be correlated with their responsiveness to il- <dig> stimulations in weak antigenic contexts , our simulation results additionally suggest that the proliferative response of cd8+ t cells to low-level tcr signals is regulated by a fine tuning of their dynamical response to il- <dig> and the il- <dig> concentration in the extracellular environment. from the single cell level, our simulations indicate a balance between the il-2•il-2r threshold level and the il-2•il-2r formation efficiency determining the activation of individual cd8+ t cells, which is further detailed in the following section. in conclusion, our model proved to be able to reproduce cd8+ t cell responses to multiple activation conditions  and to make experimentally testable predictions .

exogenous il- <dig> concentration and endogenous il- <dig> sensitivity tune the productive contact duration of cd8+t cell-apc
next we measured the impact of different il-2•il-2r threshold levels on the productive t cells-apc contact duration in response to a strong antigenic stimulation. we simulated the responses of il-2•il-2r-threshold-high and il-2•il-2r-threshold-low cd8+ t cells to strong antigens, and measured their productive contact duration with apcs . simulations show that il-2•il-2r-threshold-low cells have significantly reduced tcr-apc engagement duration  than il-2•il-2r-threshold-high cells  . this result suggests that il- <dig> sensitivity of individual naïve cd8+ t cells may influence their requirement for a prolonged contact with apcs in vivo. accordingly, our model predicts that cd5hi cd8+ t cells may have shorter productive contact time with apcs comparing to their cd5lo counterparts in vivo.fig.  <dig> the productive cd8+ t cell-apc contact time varies with a the il-2•il-2r threshold level of individual t cells  and b the exogenous il- <dig> concentration 



in addition to the il- <dig> sensitivity, the il-2•il-2r formation rate also affects the productive contact duration of cd8+ t cell-apc, which partially depends on the amount of il- <dig> in the extracellular environment during tcr engagement. indeed, we observed that a high concentration of exogenous il- <dig>  induced fast formation of il-2•il-2r in cd8+ t cells, which consequently shortened the productive contact time of t cell-apc . hence, the concentration of exogenous il- <dig> could affect cd8+ t cell activation by decreasing the t cell-apc contact time necessary for productive activation. this result is in accordance with a study by filby et al.  <cit>  showing that fyn−/− cd8+ t cells producing il- <dig> more efficiently require a shorter tcr engagement duration. thus this experimental evidence supports our prediction that t cells require shorter contacts with apcs if they can access abundant il- <dig> by autocrine production or from the neighboring il- <dig> producing cells .

taken together, the productive contact time of t cell-apc is thus influenced by both the intrinsic il- <dig> sensitivity of individual cd8+ t cells and the il- <dig> level in the extracellular environment, a prediction that could be tested experimentally, at least partially, by modifying the available il- <dig> quantities in the extracellular environment at different times during the early events of the response and measuring the subsequent expansion of the population. in addition, our model indicates that cd5hi cells require shorter contact times with apcs to become activated, which could help them entering a proliferative state faster than their cd5lo counterparts.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we used a multiscale model of cd8+ t cell dynamics, based on explicit descriptions of cellular dynamics with a cellular potts model and with cellular decision-making at the single cell level controlled by a molecular regulatory network. the main objective was to address the following questions: how does il- <dig> supplement combined with a weak antigenic stimulation induce a visible response? how does heterogeneity within the naïve cd8+ t-cell pool  may explain variations in the t cell responses? answers to those questions are not straightforward due to the dynamical, multiscale nature of the cd8+ t cell behavior. we showed that, by coupling the different relevant scales, our modeling approach shed new light on those questions.

after parameter calibration based on in vivo data, this model was capable of recapitulating the population and intracellular molecular dynamics of cd8+ t cells in murine lymph nodes following an influenza virus infection in a strong antigenic-stimulation context. overall, the simulation results are in good agreement with in vivo experimental data at multiple scales, and showed a robust performance in reproducing the response of cd8+ t cells to strong antigenic stimulations.

in order to assess the robustness of the model , we decided to assess its ability to simulate other physiological conditions for which it had not been parameterized for, e.g. in vivo homeostatic proliferation, as modeled in vitro by cho et al.  <cit> . we thus studied the responses of cd8+ t cells to il- <dig> supplement in an antigen-free condition or under a weak antigenic stimulation . no immune response was observed in an antigen-free condition with or without il- <dig> addition. with a weak tcr signal provided by contacting with weak-antigen-loaded apcs, addition of large concentrations of exogenous il- <dig> was required for cd8+ t cells to overcome the activation threshold. compared to cd8+ t cells stimulated with a weak tcr stimulation alone, exogenous il- <dig> led to a transient high level of il-2•il-2r complex at early time points  which was identified as a key force driving some naïve cd8+ t cells into the activated state . a simple examination of the cellular  or molecular  levels separately would not have yielded such kind of insight as the multiscale integration permitted. it is indeed practically difficult to predict, without a multiscale model, how a seemingly tenuous difference ) can translate into a none-or-all type of response at the cellular level.

furthermore, by manipulating the il-2•il-2r threshold level of single cd8+ t cells and implementing cd5hi and cd5lo-like cd8+ t cells, the model allowed a reproduction of responses involving high affinity  cells, for which it had been developed, and low affinity  cells, for which it had not been designed. this stressed the model robustness to high affinity and low affinity clones. second, our simulations of the proliferative responses of cd5hi and cd5lo cd8+ t cells to a weak antigenic stimulation in the presence of different concentrations of il- <dig> supplement is in good accordance with in vitro experimental data  <cit> . this result suggests that the difference between cd5hi and cd5lo cells is partially determined by their endogenous sensitivity to il- <dig> 

it has been shown that stop signals transmitted by antigen-bearing apcs towards t cells are crucial for t cell activation, since such signals enhance long-lived interactions between t cells and apcs  <cit> . however, this hypothesis has been challenged by naïve t cells becoming activated via brief interactions  with antigen-bearing dendritic cells when placed in a collagen matrix  <cit> . in our study, a reduced productive contact time of t cell-apc was observed when lowering the il-2•il-2r threshold for activation, suggesting that the sensitivity of cd8+ t cells to il- <dig> might affect their tcr engagement requirements. some studies demonstrate that the history of t cell-apc interactions experienced by individual t cells may contribute to the heterogeneity of t cell responses  <cit> . other studies suggest the sensitivity of individual t cells to the activation signals may predetermine the phenotypes of cd8+ t cells  <cit> . taken together, these results indicate that heterogeneity within the naïve cd8+ t-cell pool  may partially explain variations in the t cell responses to antigens, including t cell-apc contact duration, fate decisions and phenotype development.

although we tried to incorporate as much relevant biological information as we thought was strictly necessary for reproducing the data we had, there is nevertheless ample room for improving our model. for example, comparing to morphology of dendritic cells in vivo , the surface area of our 2d simulated apcs is small, which limits their contact frequency with t cells. this limitation is in part the reason that upper range of our simulation population size is below the observed data .

the use of 2d model instead of a 3d model can also be seen as a limitation. the computational cost of a 3d multiscale model is higher than the one of a 2d model, and mainly justifies our choice to use a 2d model . nevertheless, the result on the predicted productive contact duration between t cells and apcs in our model does not a priori depend on a 2d or a 3d model, since it mainly relies on the intracellular dynamics and the intracellular molecular model is deterministic in our current model.

in addition, a refined molecular network incorporating the eomesodermin  transcription factor could allow the generation of memory cells, based on some studies showing that eomes upregulation together with t-bet downregulation induces the formation of memory t cells  <cit> . extracellular regulating actors, like cd4+ t cells that can, among other things, contribute to il- <dig> secretion  <cit> , and environmental variables like inflammation or aging could be considered, leading to refinements of the model. one of the main limitations here would be the lack of in vivo lymph node dynamical data that would be critically needed for proper parameterization and validation of the added model elements. for example, a time-dependent characterization in the evolution of the different cellular subpopulations would permit to assess the validity of our predictions . furthermore, it would be highly valuable to obtain single-cell values of mrna expressions for the molecular actors of our network, and their time-dependent evolution during the response. the recent advent of single-cell transcriptomics  could be helpful in that respect.

in conclusion, our multiscale model study indicates that the cd8+ t cell differentiation process is an acquired property resulting from dynamical interactions between the intracellular molecular network and environmental factors. therefore, it is an ideal platform for integrating data obtained at different scales and studying how their coupling explains cellular behaviors of t cells.
