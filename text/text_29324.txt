BACKGROUND
various factors, such as heat, electricity, uv-light, and chemicals, can cause burns. although most burns are not fatal, over  <dig>  deaths occur globally each year as a direct result of burns, with 90% of burn deaths occurring in developing countries  <cit> . healing of burns is a complex process and very few effective treatments exist to facilitate the burn recovery process. antibiotics are often used to prevent or treat infections and skin or synthetic grafts are used to facilitate the healing process in cases of third-degree burns  <cit> .

fibroblast growth factors  comprise a large family genes involved in growth and differentiation. they are found in both invertebrates and vertebrates  <cit> . fgfs have been demonstrated to play essential functions in development, metabolism, and repair of various tissues and organs. human fgfs contain  <dig> family members. human fgf- <dig> is one of the most studied and characterized members of the superfamily. fgf- <dig> has various biological functions and has been associated with various stages of morphogenesis, tissue repair, angiogenesis and wound healing  <cit> .

fgf- <dig> is present in various tissues, especially within the extracellular matrix, however, isolating and purifying this protein is a complicated and tedious process. recombinant dna technology has enabled fgf- <dig> to be produced in e.coli <cit> , yeast  <cit> , mammalian cells  <cit>  and plants  <cit>  for potential medical applications. most studies designed to evaluate its effect on wound healing and tissue regeneration have administered recombinant fgf- <dig> directly to animal  <cit>  or human wound sites  <cit> . like other fgfs, however, fgf- <dig> has low stability and is very sensitive to degradation by proteases  <cit> . unfortunately, recombinant fgf- <dig> exhibits a very short half-life in vivo which limits its medical application.

salvia miltiorrhiza, also known as danshen, native to china and japan, is a traditional chinese medicinal  herb. the extract of its root has been widely used clinically to treat and prevent diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, cancer, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, etc.  <cit> . leaf extract of s. miltiorrhiza also contains considerable amounts of pharmacological compounds even it is discarded as waste during root harvest. more than seventy compounds from s. miltiorrhiza have been investigated. three major bioactive compounds, tanshinone-i, tanshinone-iia, and cryptotanshinone have been extensively studied and reported to have a variety pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory  <cit> , antioxidant  <cit> , antitumor  <cit>  and anti-platelet aggregation  <cit> . tcm compendiums indicate that s. miltiorrhiza reduces blood stasis by promoting blood circulation and repairing damaged tissues. the use of s. miltiorrhiza to treat coronary heart disease and hypertension, as well as for stroke patients, is in clinical phase iv trials . however, like many tcm herbs, the precise mechanism underlying the biological activity of s. miltiorrhiza still remains to be completely elucidated.

in the present study, fgf- <dig> was constitutively expressed in the medicinal plant, s. miltiorrhiza. presence and levels of fgf- <dig> were analyzed by elisa and western blot. aqueous extracts of transgenic s. miltiorrhiza were applied directly to fertilized chicken egg embryo chorioallantoic membranes  and to second degree burn wounds on sprague dawley  rats. results indicated that the transgenic plants exhibited a both the biological function of fgf- <dig> and the medicinal properties of s. miltiorrhiza. data indicated that the extract obtained from the transgenic plants could promote cell proliferation, speed up the growth of new blood vessels and significantly accelerate the burn wound healing process compared to the use of either fgf- <dig> or s. miltiorrhiza alone. the use of the transgenic plant extract also avoids the complicated process of fgf- <dig> extraction and purification.

RESULTS
gene cloning and plant transformation
human fgf- <dig> was cloned into the expression vector, pbi <dig>  with a kozak consensus sequence inserted before the start codon and a barley alpha amylase signal sequence at the 5′ end, driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35s  promoter  for strong constitutive expression. at least  <dig> independent putative transgenic events were obtained. all putative transformants were analyzed by pcr amplification using p <dig> and p <dig> primers. results indicated that fifty-six of the putative transformants had the predicted  <dig>  kb band.

elisa and western blot analysis
the level of rfgf- <dig> produced in the confirmed transgenic lines was determined by elisa. results revealed that the yield of rfgf- <dig> in lines t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> were <dig>   <dig> and 272 ng/g fresh leaf weight, respectively, as calculated by comparison with a standard curve constructed using commercial fgf- <dig> .

recombinant human acidic fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  protein expression in transgenic lines t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> was determined by the western blot analysis . a positive response using fgf- <dig> monoclonal antibody demonstrated that transgenic lines  had a 16 kda band corresponding in size to standard fgf- <dig>  no band was observed in protein samples extracted from wt plants. the results of the western blot also indicated that t <dig> had a higher level of expression than t <dig>  it corresponded with the results obtained in the elisa assay. since t <dig> had the highest level of rfgf- <dig>  it was examined further. transgene copy number in line t <dig> was determined by southern blot analyses . results indicated that there was a single t-dna copy integrated in line t <dig> 

proliferative effects of transgenic s. miltiorrhiza  on cell proliferation in vitro
after 72 h of culture, mtt assay revealed that wild-type s. miltiorrhiza, standard fgf- <dig>  and t-sm significantly promoted balb/c 3 t <dig> cell proliferation compared to the saline control . the viability of the cells decreased when the cells were treated with diluted concentrations of samples. after the second  dilution, wt showed had no effect on cellular viability. after the third  dilution, the absorbance of t-sm  was still significantly higher than that of s-fgf . the results indicated that treatment with t-sm greatly increased the cell proliferation compared with that of the other groups. the estimated effective dose  stimulating 50% of the maximal cell number response was determined from mtt proliferation curves. the dilution fold of ed <dig> for s-fgf and t-sm were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the converted enzyme activity of t-sm  was approximately  <dig> -fold greater than that of the standard fgf- <dig>  .
s. miltiorrhiza


effective dose  <dig>  is determined by mtt assay curve using balb/c 3 t <dig> cells. the dilution fold is used to determine that compounds are active at that concentration to proliferate 50% of the cell growth. the enzymatic activity of recombinant fgf- <dig> from transgenic s. miltiorrhiza  is determined in terms of au/ml in relation to a standard human acid fgf- <dig>  with a known activity . the specific enzymatic activity units of fgf in t-sm was calculated as 48 au/ml , with a conversion of  × 48 =  <dig>  ×  <dig> u/mg.

t-sm stimulates angiogenesis in vivo
the cam assay is widely used to study angiogenesis in vivo. our study demonstrated that treatment with extracts from wt, s-fgf and t-sm all stimulated angiogenesis . at day  <dig>  a very few large vessels with only few branching were observed with in the samples treated with just saline. in comparison to the saline treatment, a greater number of large vessels and branches were formed in the wt treatment. t-sm treatment induced a significantly greater number of large vessels and branches compared to all of the other treatments. even though the concentration of t-sm rfgf- <dig> used in the cam assay was 1/ <dig>  of the s-fgf treatment , it stimulated more vessels. the greatest amount of branch formation was also observed with t-sm-induced angiogenesis in the cam assay.

t-sm accelerates wound healing process
images of burn wounds treated with saline, wt, s-fgf , and t-sm  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> d after administering the burn treatment are shown in figure  <dig>  on day  <dig>  shrinkage of the wounds was observed in all groups. wt and saline groups had begun to form dark granulation tissue. in contrast, t-fgf- <dig> treated wounds appeared smooth and whitish. fgf- <dig> treated wounds were also smooth but exhibited some granulation tissue. on day  <dig>  wounds in all groups continued to shrink and develop thick granulation tissue. on day  <dig>  while considerable contraction of wounds was observed in all treatments, t-sm treated wounds began rebuilding healthy granulation tissue. on day  <dig>  the s-fgf and t-sm treated wounds were almost healed, while wt and saline treated wounds were still very visible and whitish in appearance. wound surface area tracing measurements  did not identify significant difference among the four treatments on day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and also revealed that the healing process appeared normal. on day  <dig>  however, both t-sm and s-fgf treated wounds were significantly reduced  in wound surface area  compared to the saline  and wt  treated wounds. s-fgf and t-sm treated wounds were almost completely healed. no difference in wound surface area was observed between saline and wt treated burns. importantly, while the concentration of fgf- <dig> in the s-fgf treatment was 1000 ng fgf-1/wound, it was only ≈  <dig>  ng rfgf- <dig> in the t-sm treatment. however, they exhibited a similar ability to accelerate the wound healing process.

histopathological assessments of burn wound healing process
histopathological analysis of normal tissues and the burn wound healing process was conducted by sectioning of tissues and staining with hematoxylin and eosin staining . a standard second degree burn wound was established . normal skin had an intact cuticle, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, collagen and a prickle cell layer . epidermal necrolysis was observed 24 h after burn treatment . in the dermis, dead cells disintegrated and collagen fibers became disorganized. hair follicles were also damaged and vasodilation and congestion of the blood vessels were evident.on day  <dig>  the saline treated burn wounds exhibited inflammatory cells in epidermal necrolysis tissue. an inflammatory response in the wound area was not obvious . in other treatments, homogeneous necrosis was evident in the epidermal exudate of burn wounds but with less inflammatory cells. the inflammatory response in the wound area was obvious with an increased number of inflammatory cells . on day  <dig>  in contrast to saline treated wounds, the burn wounds in all other treatments exhibited rapidly growing granulation tissue, including fibroblasts, capillaries, and inflammatory cells. in s-fgf and t-sm treated burn wounds, a greater amount of newly formed epidermis began to migrate into the wound area . on day  <dig>  saline treated burn wounds still exhibited a thick surface layer of dead cells. a large number of inflammatory cells were also observed with some bleeding near the epidermis. an incomplete monolayer of epidermal cells was also observed. burn wounds in all the other treatments exhibited good re-epithelialization. a thicker prickle cell layer was observed in s-fgf treated wounds than in t-sm treated wounds. tissue directly in the wound area began to form hair follicles and other skin appendages. t-sm treated wounds exhibited less necrotic tissue compared to all the other treatments.

discussion
our studies demonstrated that the medicinal plant, s. miltiorrhiza, can be used to produce functional human fgf- <dig>  in addition to acquiring the therapeutic function of fgf- <dig>  the transgenic plants also contained natural, endogeneous, medicinal compounds, such as tanshinone-i, tanshinone-iia and cryptotanshinone. the therapeutic effect of the transgenic plants was significant and greater than using either fgf- <dig> or the medicinal plant alone. western blot  assays indicated that fgf- <dig> was expressed in the transgenic s. miltiorrhiza.

the highest accumulation of recombinant fgf- <dig> level in transgenic s. miltiorrhiza was 272 ng/g fresh leave weight in line t <dig>  we found that topical application of crude extracts from transgenic s. miltiorrhiza could enhance angiogenesis and accelerate the burn wound healing process.

the drawback in using plants to produce recombinant proteins is that plant cells often recognize the proteins as foreign and target them for degradation. since only the expected single band was observed in the western blot assay, this indicated that the rfgf- <dig> in s. miltiorrhiza had not been subjected to proteolysis. reports have suggested that foreign gene expression, and protein yield in transgenic plants could increase after producing several generations  of plants from self-pollinated primary  transgenic lines  <cit> . we selected the line t <dig>  which has a single transgene integration event as determined by southern blot , to produce subsequent generations in order to determine if the yield of rfg- <dig> in transgenic s. miltiorrhiza can be increased.

extracts of non-transgenic s. miltiorrhiza can inhibit the stickiness of blood platelets and decrease fibrin  <cit> . the extract from this plant is widely used in traditional chinese medicine to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases  <cit> . one of its compounds, salvianolic acid, was reported to enhance in vitro angiogenesis in rat endothelial cells through the up-regulation of vegf and vegf receptors genes that promote cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . in the cam assays, we also observed that the s. miltiorrhiza treatment produced more blood vessels . these results indicate that s. miltiorrhiza may facilitate angiogenesis. very few studies have reported that s. miltiorrhiza has an effect on the burn wound healing process. one study indicated that injection of s. miltiorrhiza and ligustrazine can effectively reduce myocardial damage in patients with severe burns  <cit> . animal studies also indicate that s. miltiorrhiza enhances the wound healing process  <cit> . randomized clinical trial of s. miltiorrhiza suggested that it is effective in reducing skin flap ischaemia necrosis after mastectomy  <cit> . s. miltiorrhiza can stimulate the cell proliferation and it has the potential to be used for wounding healing or cosmetic treatment  <cit> . in this study, the s. miltiorrhiza treatment stimulated fibroblast cell proliferation . the burn wound healing process is complex. we did not observe that s. miltiorrhiza treatment of burn wounds reduced burn wound area compared to the saline treatment . h&e staining, however, indicated that s. miltiorrhiza treatment can promote the formation of new cells and tissues to accelerate wound re-epithelialization. s. miltiorrhiza can promote the circulation system in wounded tissue . it may improve the burn wound healing process by removing necrotic cells, attenuating the inflammatory response and apoptosis  <cit> , reducing oxidative stress  <cit> , and possibly facilitate the repair of tubular epithelia structures  <cit> .

the function of fgfs in tissue repair, angiogenesis and wound healing is well documented  <cit> . fgf- <dig> and fgf- <dig> promote cell proliferation and migration, as well as induce the physical organization of endothelia cells into blood vessel structures  <cit> . these properties can facilitate the burn wound healing process. the mtt, cam assays, and burn wound healing test used in the present study also demonstrated that the application of fgf- <dig> enhanced cell proliferation and induced a greater number of new blood vessels and reduced the burn wound surface area more than treatments in which fgf- <dig> was absent . these results were further supported by the histological analysis. the healing rate in the s-fgf treated wounds was more rapid compared to either the saline or wt treated wounds. the healing rate in s-fgf and t-sm treated burn wounds was similar. h&e staining revealed less necrosis in t-sm treated wounds than in s-fgf treated wounds. approximately  <dig>  ng of the rfgf- <dig> was used in the t-sm treatment while 1000 ng fgf- <dig> was used in the s-fgf treatment. this indicates that the t-sm treatment was significantly more efficient in its effect on angiogenesis and the burn wound healing process. the fgf- <dig> used in the s-fgf treatment was produced in e.coli. common microbial hosts such as e. coli can produce high yields of recombinant protein but lack the requisite machinery for post-translational modification required for protein stability and bioactivity  <cit> . in contrast, the protein synthesis process in plants is very similar to animal cells. the structure and function of rfgf- <dig> derived from transgenic s. miltiorrhiza may be more similar to native, human fgf- <dig> and thus have higher activity than fgf- <dig> obtained from e.coli. s. miltiorrhiza exhibits anti-inflammatory  <cit> , antioxidant  <cit>  and anti-bacterial activity  <cit> . the medicinal properties of s. miltiorrhiza combined with fgf- <dig> functions appears to accelerate burn wound healing by improving blood circulation and providing more nutrients and oxygen to the wound area.

fgfs are readily degradable in vivo, which results in a loss of biological activity and function  <cit> . fgf- <dig> biological activity was maintained in the extracts obtained from transgenic s. miltiorrhiza and applied topically to burn wounds. s. miltiorrhiza is a medicinal plant and contains natural compounds that also have various pharmaceutical functions. overexpression of fgf- <dig> in s. miltiorrhiza provides the benefits of both fgf- <dig> and the medicinal properties of the plant, which may enhance its therapeutic effects. plant specific glycans can harm humans and injection of recombinant plant therapeutic proteins may result in an immunogenic response in humans  <cit> . topical application of transgenic s. miltiorrhiza extracts avoids plant-specific glycosylated immunogenic concerns and reduces the complex and costly purification and recovery process associated with the production of therapeutic compounds in microorganisms.

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully overexpressed fgf- <dig> in transgenic s. miltiorrhiza. supernatant from homogenated transgenic s. miltiorrhiza plants promoted angiogenesis and accelerated the burn wound healing process. the product system combines the therapeutic functions of fgf- <dig> and the medicinal plant, s. miltiorrhiza. topical application of the product can reduce the costs associated with extraction, purification, and recovery. the yield of rfgf- <dig> could be further increased by optimizing the gene codon, targeting the protein to the specific subcellular compartments, or selfing of high-expressing lines to obtain homozygous plants. the mechanism associated with the enhanced biological activity of s. miltiorrhiza and fgf- <dig> combined in the same extract will require further study.
