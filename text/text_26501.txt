BACKGROUND
obesity is a global health problem strongly associated with decreased life expectancy due to high risk for cardiovascular diseases, various types of cancer, type- <dig> diabetes mellitus, and depression  <cit> . obesity has a strong heritable component that could explain as much as 40-70% of non-syndromic cases  <cit> . although genome-wide association studies  have identified more than  <dig> genetic variants associated with obesity and fat distribution  <cit> , the individual contribution of these genes is small and thus cannot fully explain the heritability of obesity. this suggests that there may be other contributing factors, including epigenetic effects  <cit> .

the coronin family encodes for actin-binding proteins that are divided into two evolutionarily conserved tryptophan-aspartic acid dipeptide - <dig> repeat containing groups, short and long, based on their domain composition and structure  <cit> . this family has seven vertebrate classes where the human members are coronin 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b,  <dig> and  <dig>  distinct from other family members, coronin  <dig>  including its homologues in c. elegans and d. melanogaster, has two duplicate wd domains in tandem repeats  <cit> . furthermore, unlike other coronin proteins, mammalian coronin  <dig> may not be an actin-binding protein but instead locates to the golgi complex and is thought to be involved in golgi complex maintenance and morphology, as well as in regulating protein trafficking in an anterograde direction  <cit> . yet, similar to other coronin-like proteins the drosophila coro <dig> homologue pod <dig> localizes to the tips of growing axons, where it crosslinks to both actin and microtubules. overexpression of pod <dig> greatly remodels the cytoskeleton to promote dynamic neurite-like actin-dependent projections  <cit> .

currently, only one study has investigated coro <dig> distribution in the mouse brain, where it was shown to be expressed in the hippocampus and cortex throughout development, however, no other brain areas were investigated in this study  <cit> . moreover, a preliminary expression profile of coronin  <dig>  obtained using western blot analysis of embryonic murine tissues, suggested it was ubiquitously expressed in peripheral organs. nevertheless, even after these studies it is still unclear which cell type express coro <dig> in vivo. in this study, we performed genome wide methylation analysis demonstrating that coro <dig> is differentially methylated in obese compared to normal-weight children. furthermore, we observed that the number of coro <dig> expressing neurons within the locus coeruleus increases after ethanol injection, a treatment known to potentiate appetite in rodents  <cit> . expressional changes of coro <dig> under different dietary compositions were analyzed to explore any possible functional importance. we provide a detailed characterization of mouse coro <dig> distribution, as well as detailed expression in the mouse brain. interestingly, knocking down the drosophila coro <dig> homologue pod <dig> in the adult nervous system induced a starvation-resistance phenotype. finally, we demonstrate that, similar to murine coro <dig>  drosophila pod <dig> expression is regulated by dietary macronutrient content.

methods
epigenetics
children’s cohort
data on  <dig> to 13 year old children were derived from the healthy growth study. more details on this study are provided elsewhere  <cit> .

for the purpose of the current analysis, a subsample of  <dig> obese and  <dig> normal-weight preadolescent girls as well as  <dig> obese and  <dig> normal-weight preadolescent boys  was selected. this subsample was initially used to investigate the effect of polymorphism in the fto gene on genome-wide dna methylation patterns  <cit> .

genomic dna was isolated from peripheral blood using qiagen maxiprep kit   <cit> .

ethics
all participants and their guardians gave informed written consent and the study was approved by the greek ministry of national education  and the ethical committee of harokopio university .

dna methylation profiling
the genome-wide illumina infinium humanmethylation <dig> bead-chip array  which allows interrogation of  <dig> cpg dinucleotides covering  <dig> genes was applied to determine the methylation profile of genomic dna isolated and purified from the peripheral whole blood. this chip gives a reliable and reproducible estimation of the methylation profile on a genomic scale  <cit> . first, bisulfite conversion of genomic dna was performed using the ez dna methylation-gold™ kit  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. briefly, 500 ng of dna was sodium bisulfite-treated, denatured at 98°c for 10 min, and bisulfite converted at 64°c for  <dig>  h. after conversion, samples were desulphonated and purified using column preparation. approximately 200 ng of bisulfate-converted dna was processed according to the illumina infinium methylation assay protocol. this assay is based on the conversion of unmethylated cytosine  nucleotides into uracil/thymine  nucleotides by the bisulfite treatment. the dna was whole-genome amplified, enzymatically fragmented, precipitated, resuspended, and hybridized overnight at 48°c to locus-specific oligonucleotide primers on the beadarray. after hybridization, the c or t nucleotides were detected by single-base primer extension. the fluorescence signals corresponding to the c or t nucleotides were measured from the beadarrays using the illumina iscan scanner. phenotypes, raw data and background-corrected normalized dna methylation data are available through the geo database  with accession numbers gse <dig> for the girls and gse <dig> for the boys.

data processing and statistical analysis
all downstream data processing and statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software r  together with the lumi  <cit> , limma  <cit>  and ima  <cit>  packages of the bioconductor project.

data preprocessing
the fluorescence data were preprocessed using the genomestudio  <dig>   software. there are two methods which have been proposed to measure the methylation level. the first one is called β-value, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  which has been widely used to measure the percentage of methylation. this is the method currently recommended by illumina, but β-values can show severe heteroscedasticity for highly methylated or unmethylated cpgs  <cit> . the second way to measure the methylation level is called m-value, which is the log <dig> ratio of the intensities of methylated probe versus unmethylated probe. even though the β-value has a more intuitive biological interpretation, the m-value is more statistically valid for the differential analysis of methylation levels. therefore, the m-value method was used for conducting differential methylation analysis.

quality control
the data were imported and submitted to quality control using a modified version of the ima.methy450pp function of the ima package. the following cpg sites and samples were removed: the sites with missing β-values, the sites with detection p-value >  <dig> , the sites having less than 75% of samples with detection p-value < 10− <dig>  the probes containing a snp, the non-specific probes , the samples with missing β-values, the samples with detection p-value > 10− <dig> and the samples having less than 75% of sites with detection p-value < 10− <dig>  a total of  <dig> probes were included in the analysis, after discarding  <dig> probes that did not reach the quality control together with  <dig> probes from the sex chromosomes.

normalization
quantile normalization was performed on the m-values of all the  <dig> cpg sites using the lumimethyn function of the lumi package.

annotation
for better interpretation of the genome-wide methylation patterns, we chose to use the expanded annotation table for the illumina infinium humanmethylation <dig> bead-chip array generated by price et al.  <cit> . there are a total of  <dig> loci for 27 k array, and  <dig> of them are not mapped to 450 k array. for those unmapped loci, we keep their original annotation from the 27 k array. the expanded annotation file was used to determine:the average methylation value of cpg sites belonging to the same island or island shores . we obtained the average methylation value of  <dig> islands/island shores, which reduced the number of interrogated locations to  <dig> sites/islands.

which gene each interrogated cpg site/island may be associated with .

the distance of each interrogated cpg site/island to the closest tss  .

the cpg density surrounding each interrogated cpg site/island . each site can either be located in a high-density cpg island , an intermediate-density cpg island , a region of intermediate-density cpg island that borders hcs , or a non-island. indeed, the local cpg density has been shown to influence the role of methylated cytosines, with methylation having more transcriptional effect in high-density cpg island and less at non-islands  <cit> .



the illumina-provided mapinfo genomestudio column was used to determine the genomic location of each interrogated cpg site. for cpg islands, the name of the island was used to determine its genomic location .

data processing
linear model
we developed the following linear model for each cpg site k, using limma’s robust regression method, with a maximum number of iteration equal to 10000: mk=ak+bkgg+bktt+bkww+bkbb+εk where mk is the m-value of cpg site k, g is the dichotomized gender , t is the tanner stage, b is the white blood cell count, w is the dichotomized weight category .

we also used the same linear model, but we added the stk <dig> rs <dig> polymorphism as an additional variable, with a higher score for a higher number of risk alelles .

the coefficients bkx summarize the correlation between the methylation level and the variables of interest. moderated t-statistics for each contrast and cpg site were created using an empirical bayes model as implemented in limma , in order to rank genes in order of evidence for differential methylation  <cit> . to control the proportion of false positives, p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons as proposed by benjamini and hochberg . an adjusted p-value >  <dig>  was considered non-significant.

rna isolation and cdna synthesis
mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the brain and external organs were removed and dissected within 10 minutes. after dissection the tissue was immersed into rnalater solution  and kept at room temperature for 1 hour. individual tissue samples were homogenized using a bullet blender  in rna-later solution. mrna was extracted from tissues using an absolutely rna miniprep kit  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. rna concentration was determined using a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . cdna was synthesized using a first strand cdna synthesis kit  with random hexamers as primers according to manufacturer’s instructions.

quantitative real-time pcr
cdna was analyzed with quantitative real-time pcr  on myiq . all primers were designed with beacon designer v <dig>  . gapdh and β-actin were used as housekeeping genes. each real-time pcr reaction with a total volume of 20 μl contained cdna synthesized from 25 ng of total rna;  <dig>  μmol/l of each primer, 20 μmol/l tris/hcl , 50 μmol/l kcl, 4 μmol/l mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μmol/l dntp, sybr green . real-time pcr was performed with  <dig>  u/μl taq dna polymerase . 30 seconds at 95°c, followed by 50 cycles of 10 seconds at 95°c, 30 seconds at 59-61°c and 30 seconds at 72°c. lastly, 5 minutes at 72°c and 10 seconds at 55°c. all rt-pcr plates had negative controls included for each primer pair, and triplicates for each sample were used. the rt-pcr experiments were performed twice to confirm the results. for normalization all tissue cdna were also run with six different primers for mouse housekeeping genes . a combined normalization factor for all the housekeeping primers was calculated for each tissue using the genorm program.

in situ hybridization
design and synthesis of rna probes
antisense probes were generated from commercial mouse cdna clones . the clones were sequenced  and verified to be correct. plasmids were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes and the probes were synthesized using 1 μg vector as template with t <dig>  sp <dig> or t <dig> rna polymerase in the presence of digoxigenin -labeled 11-utp . probes were controlled and quantified using the nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer .

in situ hybridization on free floating sections
free floating sections were washed in pbt followed by 6% hydrogen peroxide treatment at room temperature. after successive washing in pbt the sections were treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase k . the sections were post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde before pre-incubation in the hybridization buffer , and 50 μg/ml heparin  in pbt). hybridization of sections in presence of 100 ng probe/ml was performed overnight at 58°c. to remove the unbound probe the sections were washed with buffer  <dig>  followed by buffer  <dig> . the sections were incubated in the blocking solution  followed by overnight incubation combined with 1: <dig> diluted anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphates conjugated antibody . unbound antibodies were washed away with sequential washes with  <dig> % tween- <dig> tris-buffered saline . the sections were then developed using fast red . sections were photographed using a zeiss lsm  <dig> meta confocal microscope and analyzed with axiovision rel.  <dig>  software .

immunofluorescence
c57/bl <dig> adult male mice  were housed in a controlled environment  with ad libitum access to standard chow and water. mice were deeply anesthetized by introperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital and perfused through the left heart ventricle with phosphate buffered saline  and 4% formaldehyde. brains were postfixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde at 4°c followed by embedding in 4% agarose gel and sectioned using a vibratome  at 50 μm. sections were washed in pbs and  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  followed by incubation in 1x blocking reagent  and 5% normal donkey serum  at room temperature for 1 hour. primary antibodies: rabbit anti-coronin  <dig> , mouse anti-pag  were added onto slides and incubated at 4°c for 72 hours. the sections were then washed with pbt and incubated in the secondary antibodies: alexa fluor  <dig> donkey anti rabbit , alexa fluor  <dig> donkey anti-mouse  combined with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole   for nuclear staining; for 4 hours. sections were mounted using mowiol 4– <dig> . sections were photographed using a zeiss lsm  <dig> meta confocal microscope and analyzed with axiovision rel.  <dig>  software .

ethical statement
all animal procedures were approved by the local ethical committee in uppsala and follows international guidelines.

phylogenetic analyses
all known amino acid sequences of coronin gene families present in vertebrate genomes were identified and retrieved from the ensembl database, release  <dig>  coronin sequences were retrieved from the following species: homo sapiens, mus musculus, gallus gallus, anolis carolinensis, xenopus tropicalis and takifugu rubripes. in cases where several transcripts were present in the database the longest transcript was used for further analysis. to ensure whether additional sequences are present in these genomes as well as to mine coronin gene families in insects and nematodes, we built a hidden markov model  profile using the sequences obtained from the ensembl database. the hmm profile was then used as a query to identify all coronin like sequences in the genomes of drosophila melanogaster, drosophila pseudoobscura, anopheles gambiae, caenorhabditis elegans. also, using the same hmm profile, we performed a secondary search in the vertebrate genomes to ensure a final list of coronin sequences. the final list contained  <dig> coronin sequences from  <dig> organisms and was used for further phylogenetic analysis.

multiple sequence alignment of the coronin sequences were created using the mafft program , with blosum <dig> as the scoring matrix and using option e-ins-i  <cit> . the final sequence alignment was used to construct phylogenetic trees employing maximum likelihood  method and bayesian phylogenetic inference. maximum likelihood  phylogenetic trees were estimated by mega  <dig>   <cit>  statistical support for the branches was estimated by performing 500-bootstrap replicates with jones-taylor-thornton  as amino acid model. gamma distribution with invariant sites  was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites and the number of discrete gamma categories was set to  <dig>  bayesian inference trees were estimated with mrbayes version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . posterior probability of the trees was estimated using markov chain monte carlo  analysis with two parallel runs for  <dig>  generations and sampling every hundredth tree. runs were stopped when the average standard deviation of split frequencies of the two parallel runs was < <dig> . a consensus tree was built from the 75% of the sampled trees after first 25% burnin samples were discarded.

drosophila melanogaster
fly husbandry
flies were maintained at 25°c with 50% relative humidity in a 12:12 h light:dark cycle. drosophila stocks and crosses were reared on standard drosophila medium of sugar-cornmeal-yeast-agar. the following strains were used: w <dig>  uas-pod1rnai attp2) and elav-gal4;tubgal80ts }g <dig> p{tubp-gal80}ll2), were obtained from bloomington drosophila stock center .

genetic crosses
virgin females from elav-gal4;tubgal80ts were collected and crossed with male uas-pod1rnai. two different controls were crossed: virgin females from w <dig> with male uas−pod1rnai, and virgin females from elav-gal4;tubgal80ts with male w <dig>  to avoid rnai-inhibition of pod <dig> during development, the gal4/uas/gal <dig> conditional system was used. the rnai block of pod <dig> was activated after eclosion by incubating adult flies for 4 days at 29°c.

macronutrient diets
all diets consisted of varing concentrations  of sucrose  or yeast extract  in 1% agarose. newly eclosed adult males were maintained on these diets for 5 days at 25°c, 60% humidity on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle.

rna extraction
rna was extracted by homogenizing  <dig> fly heads in pbs. an equal volume of phenol: choloroform: isoamyl alcohol solution  was added to the homogenized flies and mixed.

the solution was centrifuged for 5 minutes at  <dig>  g at room temperature. the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and an equal volume of chloroform was added followed b centrifugation at previously mentioned speed and time.

ethanol and silica suspension  was added to the aqueous phase and incubated for 1 min before an additional centrifugation. the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and let dry. to remove any dna the sample was treated with dnase for 30 minutes at 37°c and subsequently at 65°c for 15 minutes.

the pellet was resolved in  <dig> ul depc-h2o and incubated for 5 minutes. to remove the silica suspension the sample was centrifuged and the rna solution was transferred to new tube. a spectrophotometer  was used to measure total rna concentration.

cdna synthesis
high capacity rna to cdna kit was used for cdna synthesis  and performed accordingly to manufactures instructions.

starvation assay
starvation resistance was measured by placing  <dig> male flies, which were  <dig> to 7 days old, in a vial containing 5 ml of 1% agarose, which provides water and humidity but no food source. the vials were kept at 25°c in a incubator, on a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. the numbers of dead flies was counted every 12 hours. this allowed for the calculation of the median time of death and survival rate. at least  <dig> replicates for each genotype were conducted.

RESULTS
dna methylation profiling and analysis of genetic association to obesity
to establish if there is a correlation between weight category and methylation levels of cpg sites/islands we investigated the genome-wide methylation profile using whole blood obtained from obese and normal-weight participants. from the first linear model, which was adjusted for age, sex, tanner stage and white blood cell count, we selected the top  <dig> sites/islands whose methylation levels correlated with a particular weight category . next, a second linear model was used, adjusted for the same confounders and weight category, where we selected the top  <dig> sites/islands whose methylation levels correlated with the obesity-linked gene stk <dig> rs <dig> polymorphism , which we previously demonstrated is associated with obesity in two independent children cohorts  <cit> . this snp data was consequently used to stratify the methylation data in order to determine if there was a common gene designated by both linear models. interestingly, only one cpg site in the top  <dig> for weight category  and another that correlated with the stk <dig> rs <dig> polymorphism , corresponded to the same gene, coro <dig> . even though these sites were distinct they displayed a consistent pattern. the site found for weight category was less methylated in obese children, and the site found for rs <dig> was less methylated in children with a higher number of obesity risk alleles. given that coro <dig> was the only gene retrieved by both linear models and from a functional perspective it was not as well characterized as the other significant genes, we decided to perform further functional tests to clarify a potential role for coro <dig> in metabolic regulation. furthermore, such a study would be proof of concept if such a genome wide methylation measurement approach could be useful in identifying novel mechanisms regulating body weight.

high mrna expression of coro <dig> in the central nervous system
the expression pattern of coro <dig> mrna was investigated in a wide range of mouse tissues using quantitative real-time pcr , in total  <dig> different tissues were examined, including  <dig> brain slices representing the entire brain. the value of the tissue with the highest expression, the thymus, was set to  <dig> and relative expression values were displayed as changes in relation to this tissue. as mentioned, the highest expression was found in the thymus, this was followed by expression levels in the striatum, hypothalamus and thalamus . moderate mrna levels were found in the entire brain and the intestine, while blood cells had the lowest level of coro <dig> expression . as a comparison, microarray expression data for the drosophila melanogaster coro <dig> homologue pod <dig> was downloaded from flyatlas  <cit> . similar to mouse coro <dig>  pod <dig> expression was ubiquitous, but had higher expression levels in the brain .figure  <dig>

a detailed characterization of the coro <dig> expression pattern in adult mouse brain was accomplished using in situ hybridization on a large number of coronal sections. the widespread coro <dig> mrna distribution observed in the cns correlated well with results obtained from the qpcr expression profile, coro <dig> was highly expressed throughout the cns. intriguingly, coro <dig> expression was found in food intake and energy homeostasis regulation areas, such as the arcuate nucleus, the anterior hypothalamic area, posterior part and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus . the caudate putamen also showed strong expression . furthermore, high expression levels were observed in all cortical layers except  <dig>  as well as in the piriform cortex . furthermore, the subthalamic nucleus and hippocampus had widespread expression levels with strong intensity .

the effect of food restriction on cns coro <dig> expression
next, using qpcr, the expression level of coro <dig> mrna was investigated in mice maintained under different dietary regimes. depriving adult male mice of food for 24-hours resulted in a statistically significant decrease in coro <dig> hypothalamic expression . although, diet-induced obese mice had a 29% increase of coro <dig> expression in the hypothalamus it was not statistically significant  . other areas investigated included the pituitary gland, brain stem and cerebellum, where no significant change in either food-deprived or diet-induced obese mice was observed.figure  <dig>

expression levels in mice under different nutritional states. the levels of coro <dig> were analyzed in mice using three different dietary parameters: control, deprived and obese mice. expression levels were analyzed in  <dig> different brain structures and peripheral organs as well as seven brain sections encompassing the entire brain. the one with significant changes are shown. all data where normalized to the mean value of the control group and significance levels were obtained by one-way anova. error bars indicate sd. each group contained eight different male c57bl/ <dig> mice. significance levels are indicated: *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p < <dig> . each group contained eight male mice.



increase in the number of coro <dig> locus coeruleus neurons in ethanol-treated mice
the locus coeruleus is a noradrenergic site involved in the regulation of complex behavioral and physiological processes, including appetite, arousal and stress homeostasis  <cit> . neurons in the locus coeruleus are known to respond to the appetite suppressant ethanol  <cit>  . intriguingly, treating mice with ethanol resulted in an 84%  increase in the number of coro <dig> positive neurons within the locus coeruleus, compared to mice injected with saline .figure  <dig> 
expression of coro <dig> in locus coeruleus  in mouse treated with ethanol. mice were treated with saline or ethanol and cells expressing coro <dig> in the locus coeruleus was visualized using coro <dig> antibody.  brain was cut coronal and the locus coeruleus is shown as overview.  close up from saline treated and  ethanol-treated mice.  the number of positive cells were counted in lc and displayed as a column chart. error bars indicate sd. significance levels are indicated: *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p < <dig> . each group contained eight male mice. scale bar:  <dig>  mm.



immunohistochemical detection of coronin  <dig> in the mouse brain
double immunofluorescent stainings were used to identify which cell types express coro <dig> in the mouse brain . all regions investigated showed a wide distribution of coro <dig> positive neurons. in fact, 72% of all the cells in the cns were found to express coro <dig> . the regions with the highest distribution were the hippocampus and hypothalamus, where coronin  <dig> expression had a 97% overlap with the neuronal nuclei  antibody, followed by the cortex  and the amygdala  . furthermore, a subset of neurons was visualized using a marker for phosphoactivated glutaminase, an antibody which is commonly used as a marker for excitatory neurons. in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, 98% and 97% of the excitatory neurons expressed coro <dig>  respectively .figure  <dig> 
distribution of coro <dig> in different regions and cells in mouse brain. expression of coro <dig> protein using immunofluorescence with an anti-coronin  <dig> antibody was performed in order to investigate the distribution of coro <dig> in different cell types and brain regions in mouse brain. four different brain regions were investigated and the averaged percentages of different cell types positive for coronin  <dig> were calculated: a. cortex, b. hypothalamus, c. hippocampus and d. amygdala.  sections were co-stained with dapi  a nuclear marker, neun antibody  for neurons and the anti-coronin  <dig> antibody . f. sections were co-stained with dapi  a nuclear marker, anti-glutaminase antibody  for excitatory neurons and the anti-coronin  <dig> antibody . scale bar:  <dig>  mm. error bars indicate sd.



phylogenetic relationships of coro <dig> and other paralogous gene families
to gain insights into the phylogenetic relationships of the coronin  <dig> family with respect to other paralogous coronin families; we performed phylogenetic analysis using sequences obtained from selected vertebrates and insects, as well as a nematode genome . amino acid sequences of the coronin  <dig> family and other coronin families from vertebrate, insects and nematode genomes were identified  and a final list of  <dig> sequences was utilized to perform phylogenetic analysis. the resulting phylogenetic tree  showed well defined clusters in accordance with previously defined coronin gene families and classes  <cit> , with high confidence support . the coronin7-like pod <dig> found in d. melanogaster and d. pseudoobscura, as well as the coronin 7-like found in a. gambiae and c. elegans formed a monophyletic clade with the vertebrate coronin  <dig> gene family . this is in accordance with previous observations  <cit> , showing further evidence for that d. melanogaster pod <dig> is homologous to vertebrate coronin  <dig>  the coronin  <dig> gene family belongs to class  <dig> coronins, which seem to have diverged considerably from class i and class ii coronins . this is possibly because coronin  <dig> proteins are relatively longer than class i and class ii coronins, containing two wd-repeat domains . also, it is worth mentioning that a recent evolutionary mining of coronins showed that coronin  <dig> is the most widespread family among all coronins, suggesting a crucial role of coronin  <dig> in most eukaryotes.figure  <dig>

pod <dig> affects starvation survival rate in drosophila melanogaster
to better understand if coro <dig> could be involved in regulating metabolic homeostasis we also used the genetically-tractable drosophila system. before beginning any assays we clarified whether uas-pod1rnai  was functional. since pod <dig> was highly expressed in the drosophila central nervous system  <cit> , we crossed pod1rnai flies to the elav-gal <dig> driver, which expresses in all neurons and performed qpcr to measure pod <dig> transcript levels. compared to heterozygous controls, elav-gal4 > w <dig> and w1118 
> pod1rnai, pod <dig> knockdown flies had only 57%  of normal pod <dig> expression levels , confirming that the pod <dig> rnai construct is effective.figure  <dig>

we employed the starvation assay to begin to clarify a role for pod <dig> in drosophila metabolic regulation, as it is a simple way to determine if a gene has an influence on metabolism. any disruption if feeding behavior, lipogenesis, lipolysis or gluconeogenesis will be uncovered using this assay. to investigate whether pod <dig> influences starvation resistance we knocked it down in all adult neurons using rnai. uas-pod1rnai flies were crossed to the pan-neuronal gal <dig> driver elav-gal4;tubgal80ts  <cit> . since the allele of the gal <dig> inhibitor gal <dig> is temperature sensitive, with the non-permissive temperature being 29°c  <cit> , this allowed us to control when pod <dig> rnai was expressed. equally aged male flies that were kept on standard lab food were placed in a vial containing 1% agarose, ensuring access to water. the vials were maintained at either 24°c or 29°c and the number of dead flies was counted every 12 hours. flies deficient for pod <dig> displayed a resistance to starvation at 24°c compared to controls  . there was also a significant increase to resistance when the flies were maintained at 29°c during the starvation assay  .

finally, in order to ascertain if pod <dig> expression could be affected by macronutrient content, we maintained flies on different diets  for 5 days and then used qpcr to determine pod <dig> expression levels. subjecting adult male drosophila to a diet rich in both protein and sugar revealed a 44% increase in pod <dig> expression levels  compared to normal fed flies. other diets analyzed did not show any altered levels .

discussion
by comparing the top  <dig> methylation sites/islands associated with weight with the top  <dig> sites/islands associated with the obesity-related stk <dig> rs <dig> snp, we found two cpg sites located near the promoter of coro7: one cpg site displayed lower methylation levels in obese children and the other site displayed lower methylation levels in carriers of the rs <dig> risk allele. our data suggests that the epigenetic regulation of coro <dig> could be associated with body weight, with decreased promoter methylation in obese subjects, which commonly leads to higher gene expression  <cit> .

to investigate coronin  <dig> further, we performed a comprehensive characterization of coro <dig> expression throughout the mouse body and brain using qpcr and in situ hybridization. intriguingly, coro <dig> is expressed in important food-regulation areas within the brain such as the hypothalamus, ventral striatum and amygdala. these results are in good agreement with other studies, which demonstrated that coro <dig> is expressed in the hypothalamus of murine embryos  <cit> . furthermore, our immunohistochemical results demonstrated that coro <dig> is found in all major brain areas, including the hypothalamus and hippocampus that had coro <dig> expression in 97% of all neurons. the distribution of coro <dig> positive staining in all neurons within the cns was 77%. these data confirm a ubiquitous expression of coronin  <dig> and overlap with the qpcr and the in situ hybridization data. the hypothalamus is a major part of the energy homeostasis network  <cit> , considering that coro <dig> was presented as a gene that is associated with obesity, it is very interesting that we find coro <dig> positive neurons to such a high degree within the hypothalamus.

the immunohistochemical stainings also revealed coro <dig> to be highly expressed in the locus coeruleus. axons of neurons whose cell bodies are located within the locus coeruleus act on adrenergic receptors in a whole variety of brain regions including: the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, spinal cord, as well as the hypothalamus  <cit> . as the locus coeruleus is the major noradrenaline synthesizing site, and many of its noradrenergic neurons project to the hypothalamus  <cit> , the fact that coro <dig> is expressed therein suggests a link between coro <dig> and the noradrenergic regulation of the hypothalamus.

it is well known that locus coeruleus neurons respond to appetite changing treatments, including ethanol injections  <cit> . in our study, we noted a significant increase in the number of coro <dig> positive neurons within the locus coeruleus in ethanol-injected mice. depletion of coro <dig> in cell culture results in breakdown of the golgi apparatus, as well as an accumulation of arrested proteins  <cit> . this suggests that coro <dig> is involved in the later stages of cargo sorting and export of proteins from the golgi complex, where coro <dig> acts as a mediator of cargo vesicle formation and protein sorting  <cit> .

given that coro <dig> is expressed to such a high degree in the locus coeruleus, coro <dig> might be involved in the transport of noradrenaline in the brain and thus regulate central feeding circuits that receive noradrenergic input. interestingly, it was reported that depriving rats of food reduces the volume and number of neurons in the locus coeruleus  <cit> . studies have demonstrated that exogenous injection of noradrenaline can both suppress, as well as to induce feeding, acting via a1-and a2-adrenoceptors to modulate eating  <cit> . furthermore, changes in body weight affect gene expression in mice  <cit> . changes in energy needs of an organism, as well as body weight, affect gene expression. the fact that coro <dig> expression was significantly down-regulated in the hypothalamus of mice under food deprivation provides further support that this gene could have a regulatory role in the central feeding circuits.

the homologue to coro <dig> in d. melanogaster is called pod <dig>  in drosophila, pod <dig> is located at the tip of growing axons, where it is involved in the crosslinking of actin and microtubules  <cit> . the human coro <dig> shows a similar molecular architecture to its homologues in drosophila and c. elegans . more specifically it has 46% and 47% similarity and 30% and 29% identical to drosophila pod <dig> and c. elegans pod <dig>  respectively. using the gal4-uas system we reduced pod <dig> expression specifically in neurons and performed a starvation assay. we found pod <dig> mutant flies displayed significantly more resistance to starvation than control flies. the decrease in susceptibility to starvation could be due to change in feeding behavior, lipogenesis, lipolysis or gluconeogenesis in the fly making it able to survive starvation. flies being subjected to a diet rich in both protein and sugar had significantly increased levels of pod <dig> mrna expression, compared to normal fed flies; this links the role of the coro <dig> homolog with both energy-and macronutrient/reward-driven feeding. these data, combined with the human and mouse studies, suggest a conserved function involving coronin  <dig> to homeostatic control and regulation of energy and food intake. in mammals this could be, for example, due to an interplay between the hypothalamus, striatum and the locus coeruleus, with noradrenaline as the neurotransmitter. we find coro <dig> mrna in sites important for energy balance but also in regions involved in reward.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, several strengths and limitations apply to the findings of this study. we do not provide a full explanation on how coro <dig> might alter the metabolism in mice or how the coro <dig> dna methylation levels affect the obese/normal-weight individuals, we merely show an association. furthermore, in regards to the findings in this study it is evident that we need to expand the line of experiments in order to be able to provide a complete functional and molecular characterization of coronin  <dig> in terms of energy homeostasis. this will also further prove the importance of coronin  <dig> in respect to metabolism in both humans and mice, as well as in the fruit fly.
