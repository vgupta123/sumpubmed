BACKGROUND
taken together, musa species  comprise the fourth most important crop in developing countries  <cit> . the fruit is a staple food in sub-saharan africa, south and central america and much of asia, while the leaves are used for sheltering and wrapping food and the male bud can be eaten as a vegetable. musa is a member of the monocot order zingiberales, a commelinid lineage that diverged from the line leading to rice  in the mid-cretaceous period over  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . the musa species musa acuminata  and musa balbisiana , both with 2n =  <dig> chromosomes, represent the two main progenitors of cultivated banana varieties. table bananas are sterile, parthenocarpic and diploids aa or triploid with the aaa genome constitution, and represent only a fraction of world production, although they are an important cash crop. cooking bananas and plantain cultivars, mostly consumed in the countries of production, generally have an aab or abb genome constitutions  <cit> ; these are boiled, fried, dried, or sometimes ground into flour.

knowledge concerning the genetic diversity, the origin of cultivars  <cit>  and musa genome structure  <cit>  has greatly increased over the last few years. the haploid genome of musa species was estimated as varying between  <dig> to  <dig> mb in size  <cit> , just four times larger than that of the model plant arabidopsis   <cit>  and 30% larger than that of rice   <cit> . genetic maps have been developed  <cit>  and recently, bac resources were generated for both m. acuminata  <cit>  and m. balbisiana  <cit> . a cytogenetic map based on bac-fish is being anchored to genetic maps in order to better characterize structural variation among m. acuminata genomes  <cit> . these resources will pave the way for studies of musa genome structure and evolution through comparisons with other monocot and eudicot genomes.

the utility of genomic comparisons of monocot and eudicot plants  is growing with the availability of the complete genome sequences of rice  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and poplar  <cit> , and active genome sequencing projects for a growing number of other angiosperms  <cit> . most genome-scale comparative investigations within the monocots have focused on analyses of closely-related species of monocots belonging to the family of poaceae  <cit> . numerous papers have described extensive microsynteny between rice, barley, wheat, maize, sorghum and sugarcane  <cit> , although the degree of conservation varies between different chromosomal locations. fewer attempts have been made to investigate the synteny between distantly-related plants. in addition, whereas extensive genomic resources have been developed for rice and other cereal species in the grass family , there is relatively little data on gene content or genome structure for non-grass monocots . recently, the first two bac clones genomic sequences  <cit> , and a bac end sequencing study of the m. acuminata genome  <cit>  have been published. here we present data on the genomic structure and organization of  <dig>  mb of musa genomic nuclear dna , show for the first time the existence of microsynteny between musa, rice and arabidopsis, characterize the extent of microsynteny between the two musa species representing the progenitors of most cultivated genotypes, analyze monocot est sequences and discuss the evolutionary implication of these results. the bac clones sequenced in this study were identified by hybridization with gene sequences previously selected to correspond to one or a few loci in musa, rice and arabidopsis, thus possibly contain orthologous sequences with these distantly related plant species.

RESULTS
selection of musa bac clones using broad-spectrum sorghum cdna and musa rflp probes
as part of a program aiming at selecting conserved probes from monocotyledons and arabidopsis thaliana towards comparative genetic mapping studies, genomic and cdna probes from various species were tested by southern hybridization on dna of various monocotyledons including musa and rice. among the probes found conserved between rice, m. acuminata cv. madang, m. balbisiana cv. pisang klutuk wulung  and arabidopsis that revealed a single or low copy locus hybridization pattern, nine were selected. these nine probes that correspond to sorghum bicolor cdnas  were used to screen a m. acuminata cv. calcutta- <dig> bacterial artificial chromosome  library . of these nine sbrpg genes, four encoded nuclear genes targeted to the chloroplast and/or implicated in photosynthetic-related functions, supporting the notion that this class of genes is under strong pressure for functional conservation. all musa bacs identified were subjected to hindiii fingerprinting. this enabled us to separate the musa bacs into groups likely to be derived from different regions of the musa genome. overall, a good correlation was observed between the number of loci identified in rice, sorghum and musa by southern blot, bac fingerprint  and analysis of whole genome sequence  for these nine sbrpg genes , all of which were found to be in single or low-copy in both musa and rice.

one bac clone was selected for sequencing for probe sbrpg <dig>  for probes sbrpg <dig>  sbrpg <dig> and sbrpg <dig>  which were found to be present in one or two copies in rice, two musa bacs with distinct hindiii fingerprints that might be derived from homeologous regions were selected for sequencing with the aim of studying the evolution of lineage-specific duplications in both musa and rice . two bac clones from m. acuminata cv. calcutta- <dig>  and two bacs from m. balbisiana cv. pkw  isolated using the genetically-mapped rflp single-copy probes cir <dig> and cir <dig>  <cit>  were also fully sequenced with the objective of studying the extent of synteny between musa a and b species as well as against the rice genome. these rflp probes were selected because they corresponded to genomic clones encoding genes of known function, cir <dig> for a ga- <dig> oxidase and cir <dig> for a beta 1â€“ <dig> glucanase, previously shown to be associated to traits of agronomic importance in controlling plant height  <cit>  and stress response  <cit> , respectively.

analysis of  <dig>  mb of musa genomic sequences reveals particular features for the musa genes
musa genome statistics
a total of  <dig> bacs  were sequenced, generating over  <dig>  mb of unique musa sequence. in order to provide a uniform set, data four additional bac sequences  were included in our annotation pipeline. these analyses revealed  <dig> predicted genes , after elimination of all putative protein coding genes smaller than  <dig> amino acid residues. approximately half of the gene models had matches in genbank. their classification based on similarities to genes found in the public sequence databases is presented in additional file  <dig> and an annotation overview of the musa genes in additional file  <dig>  gene models were also compared against the musa est database donated to the global musa genomics consortium by syngenta and maintained at the mips , revealing that at least 10% of the predicted genes had a perfect match with est sequences, thus probably being expressed in musa tissues. analysis of gene size, exon-intron structure and base composition for these  <dig> predicted genes is summarized in table  <dig>  the annotation revealed that, with the exception of ma4_78i <dig>  the bacs analyzed were gene-rich . our annotation of muh <dig> revealed a total of  <dig> gene models for an average gene density of one gene per  <dig>  kb compared with one gene per  <dig>  kb based upon the earlier annotation  <cit> . in the case of mug <dig>  our pipeline predicted a total of  <dig> gene models in the first  <dig> kb of this bac followed by a region of ~ <dig> kb containing only transposons . thus the gene density in the non-transposon containing region is one gene per  <dig>  kb, very similar to muh <dig>  previous annotation of this bac  <cit>  predicted  <dig> genes in the same  <dig> kb region for a density of one gene per  <dig> kb, with the remainder being transposon-related. the difference between the two annotations is due mainly to the larger number of hypothetical genes identified by the tigr pipeline as well as some gene splits . like the last ~ <dig> kb of mug <dig>  bac ma4_78i <dig> found to be mainly composed of class ii transposable elements and also contains  <dig> interspersed predicted genes of which only the homolog of the sbrpg <dig> probe had a match in public databases. bac-fish experiments showed that bac ma4_78i <dig> hybridized to all m. acuminata chromosomes except their extremities . this pattern of hybridization is similar to what we observed by genomic in situ hybridization  using total genomic dna as a probe and suggested that the extremities of the chromosomes are poor in repeated sequences  <cit> . two gene-rich bacs  were also analyzed by bac-fish and each hybridized at the extremity of one chromosome .

base composition and gc distribution along the musa genes
the gc content of musa coding sequences was compared with those of other monocots  and dicots  using two data sets -unigene clusters and -singleton ests found in the tigr plant transcript assembly database  and the  <dig> annotated genes  from the  <dig> musa spp. sequenced bac clones . the gc distributions of tc/est  and cds regions of the musa bacs  were found to be asymmetrical and bimodal as compared to arabidopsis and onion which are clearly symmetrical and unimodal . the musa gc content distribution resembles that of rice and other poales with higher average gc content than eudicots  and a long tail towards high gc values. we next examined gc content along the direction of transcription from the atg start codon for each predicted musa cds using a sliding window of  <dig> bases . by manual inspection of the data, we were able to identify two categories of gc profiles from the musa cds: the first set shows a marked "rice-like" gradient of gc composition from 5' to 3' end and a higher gc content than arabidopsis all along the cds , and the second set is "arabidopsis-like" lacking a significant gc gradient from 5' to 3' .

analysis of musa repetitive elements
several approaches were used to characterize the genomic sequence with respect to repeats. database searches of the predicted genes against a non-redundant protein database  revealed a total of  <dig> transposable element -related sequences. excluding te-rich bac ma4_78i <dig>  there are on average ~ <dig>  retrotransposons  per  <dig> kb. only one te of class ii encoded protein was detected. bac sequences were also screened for previously characterized musa radka repeats  <cit> ; an average of  <dig>  radka-related repeats  per  <dig> kb were identified. in an attempt to identify as yet uncharacterized repeats, the bac sequences were also analyzed by repeatscout  <cit> . after removing repeats having similarity to arabidopsis or rice proteins, musa cds, radka sequences and transposable elements, six repeats with at least three copies were identified . five of these sequences have no significant hits to genes in genbank while the sixth matches genbank accession x <dig> with a strong similarity to a part of the musa ycf <dig> chloroplast gene. analysis of individual bacs with printrepeats  <cit>  shows that each bac contains only a small number of regions that are repeated within the bac, an observation that is supported by the relative ease with which the bac sequences could be closed and finished.

microsynteny analysis between musa and either rice or arabidopsis
the  <dig> musa predicted proteins were aligned against the rice and arabidopsis proteomes. the results showed that  <dig> and  <dig> musa proteins have hits with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> against the rice and arabidopsis proteomes, respectively. the relative positions of the homologous genes identified in the rice and arabidopsis genomes were compared to the order of the corresponding musa genes with i-adhore software  <cit> . using this stringent approach, we were able to identify nine musa bac sequences showing microsynteny among the  <dig> musa bacs analyzed: eight cases with rice and one case with arabidopsis .

the i-adhore analyses identified syntenic blocks of three to ten genes . we then refined the analyses by conducting reciprocal blastp searches between the genes in the orthologous regions. this analysis extended the number of genes included in these syntenic blocks. the most interesting cases of synteny conservation were found between bac mbp_91n <dig> and rice chromosome  <dig> , bac ma4_25j <dig> and rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> , bac ma4_8l <dig> and rice chromosome  <dig> , bac muh <dig> and rice chromosome  <dig> , and bac ma4_42m <dig> and rice chromosome  <dig> . between five and eleven genes were found in common between the syntenic musa and rice orthologous regions. in most cases the common genes were found in the same order and orientation in rice and musa. however, several additional genes were typically found between the shared orthologs. interestingly, the number of genes without orthologs within otherwise syntenic regions is much higher in rice as compared to musa. this could be explained by differences between the rice and musa lineages in the rate of translocation, duplication and gene death. note also that musa bac mbp_91n <dig> displays conservation of synteny with two very distant segments on rice chromosome  <dig> 

in the case of bac ma4_25j <dig>  two rice orthologous regions were found with i-adhore analyses and reciprocal blastp searches , revealing a duplication of this region in the rice genome. it is interesting to note that the two rice orthologous regions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have lost different sets of genes compared to musa, as has been observed previously in other duplicated regions in angiosperms  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses on the  <dig> musa genes from bac ma4_25j <dig> and co-orthologs  <cit>  found on rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> revealed that these regions were the product of the genome-wide duplication that has been hypothesized to have occurred early in the history of the poaceae  <cit> . duplicate maize, sugarcane, sorghum, wheat, and barley genes occur in two separate clades in trees for loci  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  indicating that the duplication occurred before the divergence of the major grain lineages including rice, maize and wheat.

the only significant case of microcolinearity found between musa and arabidopsis involved three consecutive genes . interestingly, this musa-arabidopsis syntenic block was not found to be conserved in rice.

syntenic relationships between two regions of m. acuminata and m. balbisiana
we also investigated conservation of synteny between two regions of the genomes of m. acuminata and m. balbisiana species. hybrids between these two species represent the majority of cultivated musa genotypes worldwide. to carry out this pilot study, we selected bacs from orthologous regions of two single-copy, genetically-mapped rflp probes  encoding genes of agronomic interest. in both cases a high level of sequence conservation was found  over the entire length of the sequenced regions in common between the two pairs of bacs analyzed . the overall levels of sequence identity in genic regions were similar between the two pairs of orthologous bacs:  <dig>  % for the ma4_82i11- mbp_81c <dig> pair and  <dig>  % for the ma4_54n7- mbp_91n <dig> pair . a high degree of synteny was found between the orthologous sequences in both gene content and gene orientation. however, we observed some incongruence between the gene predictions of the orthologous bacs whose protein products have no match in public databases . in contrast, the predicted structures of genes that are homologous to known sequences were largely congruent between the orthologous bacs. given the high levels of sequence conservation between the two musa species, such variation of gene structure and exon/intron boundaries is unlikely for most functional genes. hence, this analysis supports that further validation of gene models through additional est sequencing or targeted rt-pcr is required.

* alignments between the m. acuminata gene and the orthologous sequence on the m. balbisiana sequence were identified by blast

divergence between m. acuminata and m. balbisiana
in order to evaluate the degree of divergence between the two musa genomes, we obtained maximum likelihood estimates for ks values comparing pairs of orthologous genes identified in the m. acuminata and m. balbisiana bacs. we restricted our analysis to those genes  that were intact and matched known gene sequences. for example the gene model for the 14th locus in the m. acuminata genome  is similar to a pectinesterase related protein, but the gene model was excluded from the analysis because the predicted coding sequence contained several in-frame stop codons indicating that this sequence is a pseudogene. the estimated ks values ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , far below saturation levels , with an average of  <dig>  . applying an average synonymous substitution rate of  <dig>  per  <dig> years for nuclear genes in the zingiberales , this suggests that m. acuminata and m. balbisiana diverged approximately  <dig>  mya ago.

evidence for a large-scale duplication event in the musa ancestor
we also estimated the ks values between  <dig>  pairs of duplicated musa genes identified among  <dig>  est-derived unigenes found to be part of the paralog sets  <cit> . the distribution of ks values was estimated in order to assess spikes in the accumulation of duplicated genes  <cit> . if we assume that gene duplications and gene deletions are random and have relatively steady rates during the course of evolution, such a distribution is expected to show an l shape  <cit> . the distribution of ks values for duplicated musa genes exhibits a large peak centered around ks =  <dig>   indicating an increase in the number of gene duplications that occurred in the musa ancestor circa  <dig> mya . this ancient burst of duplications is likely the result of one or more large-scale duplication events. alternatively, the observed duplications could be associated with a burst of transposon activity as has been hypothesized for some duplicate gene pairs in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, analyses of ks plots for duplicated rice genes were unable to detect the  <dig> mya duplication event in the poacae that is evident in analyses of gene trees and duplicated blocks in the rice genome . this may be due in part to the slower substitution rate we estimate for the zingiberales relative to the poaceae .

we also analyzed the  <dig>  ginger  est-derived unigenes available on the tigr plant transcript assemblies web site  <cit>   and found no evidence of large-scale duplication in the ks distribution for paralogous pairs . moreover, the modal ks for reciprocal best matches between the musa and zingiber unigene sets is  <dig>  , larger than the mode for musa paralogous pairs. the age of the most recent common ancestor for the musacaceae and zingiberaceae is estimated at  <dig> mya  <cit> . this implies an average synonymous substitution rate of  <dig>  per  <dig> years ), intermediate between rates estimated for the poaceae  and palms in the order arecales  post-dates the divergence of lineages leading to zingiber and musa , but occurred well before the separation of musa a and musa b .

ks values were also computed on  <dig>  pairs of homologous genes identified between the musa ests and the rice genome sequences. as expected, the distribution of ks values between rice-musa homologs form a single peak centred around ks =  <dig>  . using this ks value to estimate the age of the poales-zingiberales split is less straightforward than described above for the musa-zingiber split, because synonymous substitution rates clearly vary between these commelinid monocot lineages.

bac fingerprint analyses revealed that whereas sbrpg <dig> hybridized to a single locus in the musa genome, sbrpg probes sbrpg <dig> hybridized to  <dig> regions, sbrpg <dig> hybridized to  <dig> loci, and two loci were identified for sbrpg <dig>  sbrpg <dig> and sbrpg <dig> . bacs representing both distinct loci hybridizing to probes sbrpg <dig>  sbrpg <dig> and sbrpg <dig> were sequenced with the aim of dating the time of duplication relative to the divergence of the musa and rice lineages. pair-wise estimations of ks, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, were  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   for musa homologs of the coding regions of sbrpg <dig> , sbrpg <dig>  and sbrpg <dig> , respectively. phylogenetic analyses suggested that the sbrpg <dig> musa homologs duplicated prior to the divergence of the poales and the zingiberales, , and the sbrpg <dig> and sbrpg <dig> musa homologs are sister to each other in the gene tree, suggesting the duplications arose after the divergence of the poales and the zingiberales .

we also analyzed the degree of conservation between genomic regions surrounding sbrpg <dig>  sbrpg <dig> and sbrpg <dig> duplicated genes in musa and rice and found no synteny in regions anchored by these homologs. this absence of synteny could be explained by duplication events and subsequent gene losses or by the translocation of the focal genes.

discussion
analysis of musa genes reveals some particular features
sequencing and annotation of ~ <dig>  mb of musa genomic sequence indicated that most of the bacs analyzed were gene rich with a low content of transposable element. our analyses of  <dig> musa genes predicted revealed that musa genes generally have a "rice-like" bimodal gc distribution with a very asymmetrical and long tail towards high gc content as in previous studies  <cit> . however, a second class of "arabidopsis-like" genes was found with an overall low gc content and no significant gradient along the coding sequence. in contrast to a previous comparison of grass and non-grass monocots  <cit> , our analyses suggest that zingeberales genes share some characteristics with the genomes of both eudicots and members of the poaceae. this result suggests that the musa genome is more similar to cereal genomes relative to onion, asparagus and the basal-most monocot lineage, acorus.

syntenic relationships between distantly-related monocots
whereas widespread conservation of synteny has been well established for members of the grass family , gene order has not been generally conserved between rice and arabidopsis  and m. balbisiana . our data revealed an extremely high level of colinearity between the two musa genomes in both regions. however several insertions and deletions occurred during the period of divergence  of the two musa species. the high level of microsynteny between the two genomes is likely to accelerate gene isolation in m. balbisiana once the construction of the whole genome physical map of m. acuminata has been completed by the global musa genomics consortium.

unveiling the paleopolyploid nature of musa species
there is accumulating data supporting that polyploidy is one of the most important evolutionary mechanisms influencing the structure and content of angiosperm genomes  <cit> . our work indicates ancient polyploidization in the lineage leading to musa approximately  <dig> mya. similar lineage-specific events were described in the poaceae  <cit> , brassicaceae  <cit> , populus  <cit> , solanaceae, leguminoceae  <cit> , papaveraceae, acorus, the magnoliids and the nymphaceae  <cit> . polyploidy has clearly been an important source of genetic variation across the angiosperms as retained duplicate genes typically show divergent patterns of gene expression  <cit> . in musa, as in other plant species, novel phenotypes can emerge from this genomic amalgam, including some with high visibility to natural selection, such as organ size and disease resistance.

of particular interest is the "composite" nature of the duplicated rice regions relative to the syntenic musa bac ma4_25j11; different sets of genes were lost in rice chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively as compared to musa. this type of evolution is likely to reflect a dynamic of duplication  <cit>  and independent evolution in both monocot lineages including recurrent cycles of genome duplication followed by diploidization. this phenomenon was also identified by  <cit>  in their analysis of differential gene loss following duplication events in rice and arabidopsis. furthermore, our phylogenetic analyses of gene sets including the genes on musa bac ma4_25j <dig>  rice orthologs and related genes found in the arabidopsis genome and tigr gene indices corroborate previous results suggesting that a genome-wide duplication in the common ancestor of all major cereal lineages is responsible for the large duplicated segments observed in the rice genome  <cit> . this finding illustrates how comparative analyses of distantly-related monocot species can complement studies on cereal genomes.

is rice a good model to study the structure and evolution of musa genomes?
the use of rice as a reference species to accelerate map-based cloning projects by extrapolating marker position data and increasing marker density in targeted regions has a proven efficiency among cereal crops , with a perceivable trend towards decreased efficiency when phylogenetic distance increases. our analyses of the amount of microsynteny between rice and musa suggest that there are cases in which predictions based upon microsynteny are useful but also this may not be general. in addition although our data showed that musa genome is more similar to grain genomes relative to onion, asparagus and the basal monocot, acorus, the differences observed confirmed that cereal genomes are not representative of all monocots  <cit> . this work also highlight that comparative analyses between distantly-related species such as rice and musa are very important to improve our understanding of monocot genomes and more generally of angiosperms genome evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study represents the first effort to investigate the existence and extent of microsynteny between rice and musa, two-distantly related monocot species. our analyses revealed a higher degree of synteny than has been reported for other comparisons between the rice and species outside of the grass family. in addition, we identified evidence for  an extensive microsynteny between the two musa species representing the progenitors of most cultivated genotypes. in addition, we identified evidences for an ancient genome-scale duplication event in the lineage leading to musa and highlighted the complexity of analyzing the structure and evolution of plant genomes following independent cycles of genome duplication and diploidization.
