BACKGROUND
rna recognition by proteins is based on a number of specialized amino acid modules that interact with the structure and/or the primary sequence of their rna targets. the double-stranded rna binding motif  is an example of such module. the dsrm is an evolutionary conserved  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids region that can adopt a typical α − β − β − β − α fold with the most conserved residues mainly located in its c-terminal part  <cit> . dsrms bind perfect or imperfect rna-rna duplexes  by contacting two ribose 2′-oh residues on each side of the sugar backbone  <cit> . consequently, dsrm-containing proteins bind rna based essentially on structural features and not on primary sequences although, in some cases, a specific primary sequence can influence binding by inducing a particular rna secondary structure  <cit> . dsrm are often found in multiple copies and/or associated with other functional domains such as ribonuclease iii, dead/deah box helicase, paz, serine/threonine kinase, phosphatase and adenosine deaminase . dsrm-containing proteins have been involved in a number of biological functions including cellular mrna transport and localization  <cit> , rna maturation  <cit> , mrna edition  <cit>  and degradation  <cit> , mrna translation  <cit>  and rna interference processes  <cit> .

in plants, dsrm-containing proteins have been essentially involved in the rna interference process. eighteen dsrm proteins are present in arabidopsis thaliana, including four dicer-like  and five double-stranded rna binding  proteins  <cit> . dcls are key enzymes involved in the biogenesis of the different classes of small interfering rnas and are composed of one or two dsrm associated with rnase iii, paz, duf <dig> and helicase domains. dcl <dig> is responsible for the production of  <dig> nucleotides micrornas from rna polymerase ii precursor transcripts  <cit>  as well as for the production of phased cis natural antisens sirnas, while dcl <dig> cleaves the primary convergent transcripts into  <dig> nucleotides duplex in this pathway  <cit> . dcl <dig> is also implicated in gene silencing induced by exogenous dsrnas, as is dcl <dig>  <cit> . dcl <dig> also generates phased trans-acting sirnas from dsrna provided by the action of a mirna loaded risc and rna-dependent rna polymerase  <dig>   <cit>  and is also responsible for the formation of some micrornas  <cit> . finally, dcl <dig> acts in the rna-dependent dna methylation  pathway on precursor molecules generated by rna polymerase iv and rna-dependent rna polymerase  <dig> , to produce essentially  <dig> nucleotides p4-sirnas that guide dna methylation, mostly to repeated sequences and transposable elements, thus participating in genome defense  <cit> . other major actors of the rddm pathway include argonaute  <dig>  and rna polymerase v, both involved in the recruitment of dna methylation enzymes  <cit> .

plant drbs are strictly composed of two dsrms with no other functional domain. arabidopsis possesses five known drb   <cit> , each containing two n-terminal dsrms. drb <dig> and drb <dig> have been well characterized and act as non-catalytic cofactors of dcls. drb <dig>  also known as hyl <dig>  is required for dcl1-mediated processing of mirna precursors  <cit> . drb <dig> acts as a dimer and interact with dcl <dig> via its second dsrm  <cit> , while the first dsrm binds mirna precursors as well as mature mirna duplexes  <cit> , assisting in the cleavage and in the mirna strand selection. dcl <dig> is assisted by drb <dig>  <cit>  and this protein is essential for dcl <dig> in vitro activity  <cit> . drb <dig> has also a role in resistance against pathogens, distinct from its action alongside dcl <dig>  <cit> . the role of the three other arabidopsis drbs is more elusive. drb <dig> seems to interact with dcl <dig>  impacting the methylation of a viral genome  <cit>  while drb <dig>  drb <dig> and drb <dig> have all been implicated in an atypical mirna biogenesis pathway  <cit> . in a previous work, we have shown that mutants deficient in drb <dig> accumulate higher amounts of p4-sirnas  <cit> , suggesting a role for this protein in the rddm pathway. in this work, we demonstrate that drb <dig> is part of a high molecular weight nuclear complex containing many co-repressors and chromatin regulatory factors, suggesting that changes in p4-sirna levels in drb <dig> mutant may be the consequence of uncontrolled transcription of rddm loci. we proposed that the binding of nascent transcripts by drb <dig> might facilitate the recruitment of repressing epigenetic factors that provide fine-tuning of transcription at targeted loci. loss of drb <dig> would mainly result in an increased production of transposable element transcripts that would be readily converted in p4-sirnas by the rddm machinery.

RESULTS
in vivo, drb <dig> exists as a nuclear high molecular weight complex
since the drb <dig> mutation leads to an increase in the abundance of p4-sirna of all sizes  and classes   <cit> , we set out to document the role of drb <dig> in the rddm pathway. as a first step, we generated transgenic plant lines in the drb2- <dig> background, expressing the complete drb <dig> genomic sequence, under the control of its own promoter, defined as the whole intergenic region  upstream of drb <dig>  fused in c-terminal to either two flag and two ha tags , or four cmyc tags . figure 1a shows that first generation transformed plants restore a wild-type like accumulation of p4-sirnas , in contrast to the symptomatic over accumulation phenotype of drb <dig> , while they do not affect the quantity of both tas <dig> and mir <dig> small rnas. homozygous descendants from these plants were considered as complemented lines and were used in the following studies. in order to document the subcellular localization of drb <dig>  the above-mentioned drb <dig> genomic construct was fused to the coding sequence of gfp  and bombarded into onion cells. in all observed cells, drb <dig> was found in the cytoplasm and in the nucleoplasm, while consistently excluded from the nucleolus . although a gfp signal of similar intensity is present in both cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, drb2-flagha appears to be mainly nuclear when cell fractionation is performed . whether a fixed quantity of protein or a fixed proportion of each extract is analysed, drb <dig> is found mainly in the total nuclear extract  as well as in the remaining insoluble nuclear pellet . the drb2-flagha signal observed in the cytoplasmic fraction is weak , but likely significant as drb <dig> can be immunoprecipitated from cytoplasmic extracts . altogether, these data show that drb <dig> is enriched in the nucleus, suggesting that its main function occurs in this compartment.figure  <dig> 
drb <dig> is found predominantly in the nucleus and forms a high molecular weight complex as well as a homo interaction.  level of small rna accumulation in wild-type , drb2- <dig> and two complementing lines. values are normalized to u <dig> rna and are expressed as a ratio relative to col- <dig>  for p4-sirnas, only the 24-nt species were used for normalization.  subcellular localization of drb2-gfp in a heterologous system. gfp signal is observed both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, but is absent from the nucleolus.  subcellular localization of drb2-flagha by cell fractionation and western blot. drb2-flagha appears to be mainly nuclear. extracts from each compartment were loaded in a sds-page either as a fixed protein quantity  or as 1/100th of the total extract . c stands for cytoplasm, n for nucleus and p for pellet. drb2-flagha is revealed with a commercial ha antibody , ugpase is used as the cytosol quality control and h <dig> as the nuclear quality control.  coimmunopurification of the drb2-cmyc protein from drb2-flagha bound flag magnetic beads. drb2-flagha is able to bind drb2-cmyc, while nerd-flagha is not. drb2-flagha and nerd-flagha are both revealed with a commercial ha antibody and the presence of drb2-cmyc in the drb2-flagha eluate is revealed with a cmyc commercial antibody.  gel filtration on a superose  <dig> column of drb2-flagha crude extracts. the elution profile of drb2-flagha shows that it is present in a high molecular weight complex of an approximate mass of  <dig> mda as well as in the intermediate forms of lower mass of this complex. fractions  were analysed by western blot, and drb2-flagha is revealed with ha antibody. fraction numbers, sizing standards and corresponding volumes are indicated.



knowing that hyl1/drb <dig> binds mirna/mirna* duplexes as a homodimer  <cit> , we tested if two drb <dig> molecules could interact in planta. we immunoprecipitated drb2-flagha using anti flag magnetic beads, which were then challenged with drb2-cmyc extracts. a specific signal is obtained for drb2-cmyc in the drb2-flagha ip, but not in the nerd-flagha negative control  <cit> , which is derived from the same plasmid . this suggests that drb <dig> can indeed make homo interactions in vivo. as four other drb proteins exist in arabidopsis, we also tested if drb <dig> is able to interact with other drbs, especially drb <dig>  as the drb <dig> mutation shows an opposite molecular phenotype to that of drb <dig>  <cit> . in cotransformed plants possessing both the drb2-flagha and the drb4-cmyc constructs, no cmyc signal is observed after a flag ip . similarly, no signal was observed after a flag ip for drb <dig> and drb <dig> using custom made antibodies .

to document the possible ability for drb <dig> to form further complexes, we performed size fractionation experiments. when eluted through a superose  <dig> column, which allows good separation of high molecular weight material, drb2-flagha is found in a peak near the  <dig> mda molecular marker  and throughout the following fractions down to fraction  <dig>  this result suggests drb <dig> is part of a high molecular weight complex with a maximal approximate size of  <dig> mda and that the signal observed in fractions  <dig> to  <dig> reflects intermediate forms of this complex down to the monomeric form. we were able to stabilize this high molecular weight complex by incubating for only five minutes with a crosslinking agent , although an important proportion of drb2-flagha still remains as a monomer  . lower molecular weight intermediate forms could also be observed by lowering the concentration of dsp . as the maximum elution size of drb2-flagha is close to that of the dextran and might be excluded from the column , we performed the size fractionation experiment again, and collected smaller fractions . this way, we were able to see that drb2-flagha is included in the resolving range of the column .

altogether, our data suggests that drb <dig> is present in a high molecular weight complex of approximately  <dig> mda that probably function in the nucleus, and that although drb <dig> is likely able to form a dimer, it does not interact with the other tested drbs.

the drb <dig> complex is devoid of the major components of the rddm pathway
since dcl <dig> and dcl <dig> respectively necessitate drb <dig> and drb <dig> to achieve proper small rna production  <cit> , we decided to test if drb <dig> is also a dcl cofactor. using the drb2-flagha complemented line and antibodies raised against dcl <dig>  dcl <dig> and dcl <dig>  we performed flag ips using an experimental set up very similar to the one we used previously to detect the drb4/dcl <dig> interaction in vivo  <cit> , but could not detect any interactions . the same approach was also used to test the interaction to other main components of rddm, namely polymerases iv and v, rdr <dig> and ago <dig>  additional file 2: figures s2b, s2c and s2d show that, as it is the case for dcls, no interaction could be seen between drb <dig> and rdr <dig>  ago <dig>  nrpd <dig> and nrpe <dig> . taken together, these results suggest that drb <dig> does not interact with any of these rddm components, and that the p4-sirna accumulation phenotype of the drb <dig> mutant  is likely not linked to a direct role for drb <dig> in this particular pathway.

we next tested the impact of the drb <dig> mutation on dna methylation. in accordance with the observed over accumulation of p4-sirna , one could expect hypermethylation of transposable elements  loci controlled by these p4-sirnas. dna methylation levels were assessed by bisulfite sequencing for non-autonomous short interspersed element  individual copies that have numerous p4-sirnas matching their genomic sequence. no significant variation is obtained for sb2- <dig>  sb3- <dig> and atsn <dig>  sine copies in the drb <dig> mutant , while the nrpe <dig> mutation, included here as a control, clearly affects chg and chh methylation as well as cg methylation to some extent.

we also investigated the possibility that the drb <dig> mutation results in changes in te rna levels. no reproducible change in rna accumulation was observed for a diverse set of tes in the drb <dig> background compared to the wild type situation . we also generated drb <dig> x ddm <dig> lines, taking advantage of the ddm <dig> background, known to accumulate several te transcripts  <cit> . we observed that despite the higher level of p4-sirnas linked to the drb <dig> mutation , changes in steady state levels of te rnas are weak and not always significant in the drb2/ddm <dig> double mutant compared to the single ddm <dig> mutant .

overall, these results suggest that drb <dig> does not play a major role in maintaining correct methylation pattern in rddm and that the drb <dig> mutation is not associated with significant modifications of steady-state levels of full length te rnas.

drb <dig> interacts with many proteins linked with chromatin regulatory functions
to further investigate the role of drb <dig>  we performed affinity purification from floral tissues of the drb2-cmyc line and mass spectrometry was used to reveal co-purifying proteins. ips from drb2-cmyc and col- <dig> were subjected to sds-page and specific bands appearing in the drb2-cmyc lane were cut and analysed separately. after removing contaminants found in the col- <dig> extract, drb <dig> was found to be the top scoring protein at its expected size, with a good coverage and empai . interestingly, many of the co-purifying proteins have previously been described as epigenetic regulators. prmt4b  is able to methylate numerous arginines from the h <dig> histone and has been implicated in the regulation of flowering time  <cit> . similarly, hda19/hd <dig>  acts directly on chromatin by removing acetyl groups from various h <dig> and h <dig> lysines and has been implicated in a wealth of biological processes  <cit> , notably apical embryonic fate  <cit>  and floral identity  <cit>  alongside tpl  which is also found in the ip. also found in the drb2-cmyc affinity purification are: nfa <dig>  a protein homologous to an animal histone chaperone, two chromatin remodelling factors, nuc <dig>  and swi3a   <cit> , mbd <dig> a protein involved in the recognition of methylated cytosines, and implicated in nucleolar dominance in the hybrid species a. suecica  <cit> . surprisingly, ago <dig> is found in two different bands although we have previously been unable to document an interaction with drb <dig> .table  <dig>

one of the top scoring proteins in our mass spectrometry analysis, msi <dig> , has also been implicated in the epigenetic regulation of flowering time and cold response  <cit>  as well as in the transcriptional control of tes  <cit> . msi <dig> also acts as a substrate adaptor in cul4-ddb <dig> ubiquitin e <dig> ligases via its wdxr motif, and it has been shown that the cul4-ddb1msi <dig> complex is present at flc chromatin and interacts with a component of the polycomb repressive complex  <dig>   <cit> , thus regulating flowering. intriguingly many other dcafs , which contain the wdxr motif inside a wd <dig> domain  <cit> , are also purified alongside drb <dig>  this is the case for msi <dig>  prl <dig> , at3g <dig> and at2g <dig>  while the ip contains other wd <dig> containing proteins not classified as dcafs . accordingly, the ip also contains akin <dig>  a snf1-related protein kinase, which is ubiquitylated by the cul4-ddb1prl <dig> complex to promote its degradation  <cit> , and cand <dig> , a protein acting as an inhibitor towards cul <dig>  <cit> .

in order to confirm the interaction between some of these proteins and drb <dig>  in planta co-immunoprecipitations were performed using the drb2-flagha line and epitope tagged versions of prmt4b, msi <dig>  hda <dig> and mbd <dig> . consistent with the ms analysis, we are able to observe co-ip of drb2-flagha with prmt4b-cmyc after a cmyc ip , with hda19-gfp after a gfp ip  in f <dig> plants possessing both epitope tagged proteins. similarly, a specific signal for drb2-flagha is obtained after a gfp ip with both msi4-egfp and egfp-msi <dig> proteins, while no signal is observed when only drb2-flagha is present in the crude extract . this interaction is also observed when both proteins are transiently expressed in nicotiana benthamiana . however, using a similar ip protocol on extracts from plants co-expressing drb2-flagha and mbd10-cmyc, we were not able to confirm in planta the drb2-mbd <dig> interaction suggested by the mass spectrometry data .figure  <dig>

with proteins involved in chromatin regulation.  co-immunoprecipitations confirming the interaction between drb <dig> and  prmt4b,  hda <dig>  and  msi <dig>  for each experiment, f <dig> plants resulting from the cross between the two lines and harbouring both transgenes were used, while either the parental line or a f <dig> plant segregating only one of the transgenes were used as negative controls. inputs and purified fractions were analysed by western blot. background bands are indicated by an asterisk .  gel filtration on a superose  <dig> column of drb2-flagha, prmt4b-cmyc, hda19-gfp and msi4-egfp crude extracts. fractions  were analysed by western blot and fraction numbers, sizing standards and corresponding volumes are indicated. in all cases, drb2-flagha is revealed with a ha antibody, prmt4b-cmyc with a cmyc antibody and hda19-gfp, msi4-egfp, egfp-msi <dig> are revealed using a gfp antibody.



to further characterize the complex formed by drb <dig> and its partners, we performed gel filtration on the same superose  <dig> column for all the epitope tagged interacting proteins. consistent with an interaction with drb <dig>  prmt4b-cmyc, hda19-gfp and msi4-egfp all elute in the same maximal fraction, around  <dig> mda, as it is the case for drb2-flagha, although their elution profiles are not strictly identical . prmt4b has the profile resembling the most that of drb <dig>  with enrichment infractions  <dig> to  <dig>  while hda19-gfp and msi4-gfp show a broad peak between fractions  <dig> and  <dig>  and fractions  <dig> to  <dig> respectively . nevertheless, our results support the notion that these proteins form a large multimeric complex, at a maximal size around  <dig> mda.

drb <dig> is able to bind transposable element transcripts in vivo
drb <dig> harbours two n-terminal dsrms whose presence is conserved in all a. thaliana’s drbs and allows drb1/hyl <dig> and drb <dig> to bind to double-stranded rna  <cit> . in vitro reconstituted drb <dig> is able to strongly bind to a perfect double-stranded rna substrate  <cit>  suggesting the existence of in vivo rna targets for this protein. we first assayed the binding of drb2-flagha to small rna duplexes by ip and subsequent labelling with pcp , which allows detection of any kind of rna with free 3′-oh moieties. no specific signal was obtained for abundant cellular rnas between 100-nt and 70-nt  and more importantly, no enrichment was observed for small rnas between 30-nt and 20-nt  suggesting that unlike drb1/hyl <dig>  drb <dig> is unable to bind small rna duplexes.

we next asked whether drb <dig> is able to bind transcripts arising from tes, which would be consistent with its presence in a chromatin regulatory complex. ips followed by rt-pcr were performed in the ddm <dig> mutant, allowing for easier detection of low abundance te transcripts. specific signal was obtained for the drb2-flagha x ddm <dig> ip for both sb2- <dig> and sb2- <dig> te transcripts . as sines tend to be inserted close to genes in euchromatic regions  <cit> , amplifications with primers around the sines were used to detect possible co-transcripts. although a low level of co-transcript was observed for sb2- <dig> in the input, no such transcripts were seen in the ip, suggesting that drb <dig> is able to bind efficiently highly structured sine transcripts  <cit>  originating from pol iii transcription . transcripts from a diverse set of tes were assayed in the same fashion and yielded similar results . evadé, a ltr retrotransposon from the copia family, prone to transcriptional reactivation in met <dig> and ddm <dig>  is also found in the ddm <dig> x drb2-flagha ip  but not in the col- <dig> ip . the detection of athila transcripts was achieved with primers matching numerous copies of this abundant gypsy class te, and specific signals were obtained with both the ltr and the internal sequence. transcripts from gp <dig>  another gypsy element presenting new genomic insertions in self-pollinated ddm <dig> plants  <cit>  were also found bound to drb2-flagha, as were cac1/2/ <dig>  and vandal  <dig>  transcripts, both dna transposons .figure  <dig> 
drb <dig> is able to bind te transcripts.  rna immunoprecipitation  from mixed floral tissues of sine transcripts in drb2-flagha x ddm <dig> plants and ddm <dig> plants included as a negative control. total rna is extracted following the ip, dnase treated and reverse transcribed. pcr amplification is performed with primers specific to one element, and a second set of primers specific to the putative co-transcript. each time, a control reaction is performed with water instead of matrix cdna , and each time, absence of contaminant genomic dna is assessed by performing the same amplification with the non-reverse transcribed material .  same rip experiment performed on a diverse set of tes, one copia, two gypsies and one cacta. primer sets used to amplify the athila family are designed on a consensus sequence and can therefore amplify numerous genomic copies, both in the ltr and in the internal sequence. evadé, gp <dig> are locus specific primers while cac1/2/ <dig> primers detect three different loci. the same control reactions are performed.



discussion
animal drbs have been involved in many different functions  <cit> , but surprisingly this is not the case for plant drbs that so far have been strictly associated with the biogenesis of small rnas in diverse rna interference processes  <cit> . arabidopsis thaliana drb <dig> mutants present a  <dig> to  <dig> fold increase in rddm associated p4-sirna  again suggesting that plant drb <dig> is involved in regulating small rna biogenesis and is therefore a regulator of rddm. however, we show in this work that drb <dig> influences p4-sirna accumulation in a process that likely works independently of the rddm pathway.

we first observed that drb <dig> is mainly a nuclear protein, that can possibly form a homodimer and can further associates to other proteins to form a high molecular weight complex in vivo . based on the molecular phenotype of drb <dig> plants , we initially developed a targeted approach to identify drb <dig> partners among rddm actors, starting with dcl <dig>  the enzyme involved in cutting p4-sirna precursors  <cit> . with an experimental set up very similar to the one we used to detect the drb4/dcl <dig> interaction in vivo  <cit> , we were unable to show that drb <dig> interact with dcl <dig>  or with any of the other dcls tested . this result suggests that, in contrast with drb <dig> and drb <dig>  drb <dig> likely isn’t a dcl cofactor. we also observed that drb <dig> does not interact with other major rddm actors . in addition, drb <dig> plants, despite presenting a high level of p4-sirnas, do not show significant variations in transposable element dna methylation levels . this result could be explained if in vivo sirna levels are not limiting so that an increase in sirnas has no clear impact in target methylation levels. alternatively, drb <dig> mutant may accumulate “cytoplasmic only” sirnas that would be non-functional in methylation. overall, these results suggest that the loss of drb <dig> does not influence the general output of the rddm pathway , at least in standard plant growth conditions, and that the increase in p4-sirna observed in drb <dig> plants is probably the result of a crosstalk with another yet to define pathway.

to learn more about this putative new pathway, we used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify drb <dig> co-purifying proteins. most of the significant co-purifying proteins turned out to be epigenetic regulators . three  drb <dig> interacting partners, suggested by mass spectrometry data , were confirmed in vivo using targeted immunoprecipitation experiments  and were found to co-migrate with drb <dig> in a  <dig> mda complex following gel filtration , suggesting that drb <dig> is part of a high molecular weight epigenetic complex. one member of this complex is hda <dig>  a major plant histone deacetylase involved in a wide variety of gene repressing functions  <cit> . tpl, a known transcriptional corepressor that interacts in vivo with hda <dig> to repress root identity genes in the apical part of the embryo  <cit>  and floral identity genes in association with apetala <dig>  <cit> , is also present in our data set. another confirmed member of the complex is prmt4b, one of the two plant homologues of the animal carm <dig> arginine methyltransferase, an enzyme that can mono and dimethylate arginine in position  <dig> and  <dig> of histone h <dig>  <cit> . prmt4b, in association with prmt4a, was shown to repress flc, but it is not clear at the moment if this repressive effect involves a change in arginine methylation level at this locus  <cit> . the last confirmed member is msi <dig>  a substrate receptor of the cul4-ddb <dig> e <dig> ligase that was shown to interact with histone deacetylase , with tek, a transposable element silencing protein, and with members of the polycomb repressive complex  <dig> to regulate gene expression  <cit> . the nature of these in vivo partners suggests that the main function of the drb2-associated complex is to epigenetically downregulate transcription at targeted loci by inducing a repressive chromatin state. it is intriguing to observe that, in addition to msi <dig>  three other substrate receptors of the cul4-ddb <dig> e <dig> ligase  one cul <dig> regulator  and one target of the cul4-ddb1prl <dig> e <dig> ligase complex  are present in our data set  <cit> . since cul4-ddb <dig> complexes have been shown to directly modify histones  <cit>  and to help in the recruitment of enzymes involved in chromatin remodelling or histone modifications  <cit> , it is tempting to propose a central role for these different substrate receptors of cul4-ddb <dig> e <dig> ligase in the organisation and function of the drb2-containing complex.

one hypothesis to explain the presence of an rna-binding protein as part of an epigenetic regulator complex is to propose that drb <dig> is able to bind structured nascent transcripts thus helping targeting the complex to corresponding transcription sites. using an rna immunoprecipitation method we were able to show that drb <dig> can indeed bind te transcripts  in vivo . this is possibly due to the fact that te transcripts are likely to contain double-stranded structures and that drb <dig> was shown in vitro to bind double-stranded rnas  <cit> . however, this result does not exclude that drb <dig> can bind other type of long structured transcripts in vivo. since one protein associated with drb <dig> in the complex is hda <dig>  the loss of drb <dig> could affect targeting of the complex and possibly result in an increase of acetylated histones in drb <dig> mutants. using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we were not able to observe a significant increase in h3k9-k <dig> acetylation levels in drb <dig> plants at the three sites tested . one possible explanation for this result is the possible functional redundancy between drb <dig>  drb <dig> and drb <dig>  out of the five known drbs, these three share high sequence identity, even outside the boundaries of their dsrms, and while all simple mutants for these proteins essentially appear wild type, the triple drb2/drb3/dr <dig> mutant is severely affected in its growth  <cit> . such a severe phenotype would be expected if these proteins all help target a large regulatory complex to chromatin. an alternative, non-exclusive, possibility is that complex recruitment is a multifactorial process, drb2-binding being only one of different targeting strategies.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our results, we propose that drb <dig> is involved in targeting a high molecular weight repressive epigenetic complex mainly to te transcription sites by binding structured nascent transcripts . this complex could operate independently of rddm in a negative feedback loop to fine-tune transcription, adjusting site by site the epigenetic state to the level of transcripts. according to this model, targeting defects induced in drb <dig> mutants would increase transcription at most te sites, but in the context of a fully functional rddm pathway, neosynthesized full length te rnas would not accumulate to high level but would be converted to sirnas. further validation of this model will require a better functional characterization of the drb2-associated epigenetic complex.figure  <dig> 
proposed model for the action of the drb <dig> containing complex, and the resulting situation in the
drb2
mutant.  in wild type plants, both the rddm and the drb <dig> containing complex act independently to negatively regulate te transcription. rddm uses sirna-mediated dna methylation to induce silencing while targeting of the drb <dig> complex to te nascent transcript would directly result in an increase in chromatin repressive marks at these loci.  in a drb <dig> plant, targeting efficiency of the complex to nascent transcripts decreases leading to and increase in te transcription. as no components of the rddm are impaired, these transcripts are routed to dcl3/rdr <dig> for p4-sirna biogenesis leading to the symptomatic over-accumulation of p4-sirnas observed in the drb <dig> mutant without changing the steady state level of te rnas.
