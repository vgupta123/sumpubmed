BACKGROUND
the cd <dig> molecule is a cell-surface glycoprotein receptor expressed by helper t cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells; and its structure consists of four immunoglobulin-like domains  as part of the extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail  <cit> . the extracellular domain binds to the monomorphic region of mhc class ii to increase the affinity of the t cell receptor to the antigen peptide-mhc class ii complex  <cit> . the cytoplasmic portion of cd4+ recruits tyrosine kinase, lck, and the kinase enhances signal transduction in t cell activation  <cit> .

microminipigs are extra-small and novel miniature pigs developed for biomedical research in japan  <cit> . recently, swine leukocyte antigen  haplotypes were assigned in a herd of microminipigs in order to further investigate their immunological characteristics  <cit>  during disease and infections. in the process of analyzing helper t cell function, we found that some pigs had cd4+ cells that could not be detected by flow cytometry while using three anti-pig cd <dig> monoclonal antibodies of the clones 74-12- <dig>  mil <dig>  and pt90a  <cit> . the pedigree analysis indicated that the cd4-undetectable trait might be recessive, suggesting gene variation  <cit> . failure of cd <dig> cells to react with an anti-pig cd <dig> antibody was reported previously in the nih miniature swine  <cit>  and the presence of partial nucleotide sequences and  <dig> amino-acid substitutions in exon  <dig> and  <dig> of two kinds of cd <dig> alleles  in these miniature swine might be the cause of helper t cells not reacting with the anti-pig cd <dig> antibody  <cit> . on the other hand, because microminipigs have no consanguinity with nih miniature swine, the cause for the failure of cd <dig> cells to react with the anti-pig cd <dig> antibody in microminipigs might be different from nih miniature swine. hence, we need to clarify the variations in the cd <dig> nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the positive and negative antibody phenotypes in microminipigs.

in this study, in order to clarify the reasons for the failure of the anti-pig cd <dig> antibodies to react with and detect peripheral cd4+ cells and to assess whether sequence variations within the cd <dig> molecules of microminipigs might cause immunological alterations, we 1) sequenced and analyzed the coding sequence  of cd <dig> using genomic dna and reverse transcribed -pcr products of cd <dig> mrna in microminipigs,, 2) developed a simple pcr-rflp method to identify the cd <dig> sequence variant and the positive and negative pbmcs reactivity to anti-pig cd <dig> monoclonal antibodies, and 3) examined the expression of the cd <dig> alleles transfected into hela cells.

methods
microminipigs
microminipigs were raised in a conventional environment at fuji micra inc.  or gifu university. this study was carried out along the gifu university laboratory animal guidelines.

flow cytometric analysis
flow cytometry was performed as previously  <cit> . briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells  of  <dig> microminpigs were isolated using lymphoprep , stained with a fitc-conjugated anti-pig cd4a antibody , and analyzed using facscalibur  to classify the pigs with and without cd <dig> affinity for the 74-12- <dig> antibody. the data was analyzed with flowjo version  <dig> . <dig> software . the antibody reactivity with the cd <dig> protein was measured as the mfi  of cd4+ cells in pbmcs.

direct sequencing of cd <dig> coding region
genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood, pieces of tail or ear tissues of  <dig> microminipigs  using a wizard genomic dna purification kit . cd <dig> gene-specific primer pairs for amplification and sequencing of the coding region  were designed as shown in table  <dig> based on a swine reference sequence . the pcr cycling parameters included an initial denaturation step of 4 min at 94 °c, 35 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 °c, 30 s at 60 °c, 30 s at 72 °c, and a final extension step of 7 min at 72 °c. sequencing was performed with abi prism  <dig>  using big dye terminator ver.  <dig>  . the nucleotide and deduced amino-acid sequence results were aligned using genetyx version  <dig>  with three swine cd <dig> sequences: .table  <dig> cd <dig> exonic primer sets for dna sequencing




cd <dig> genotyping by pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism  method
the pcr-rflp technique in association with the restriction enzyme bseri was used to identify and differentiate between the two cd <dig> alleles. pcr amplification was performed on genomic dna to amplify cd <dig> exon  <dig>  and the pcr products were digested with an enzyme, bseri . the allele-specific bands were analyzed by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis.

we determined the hereditary pattern of cd <dig> alleles of sibs from heterozygous parents by using the pcr-rflp method to genotype  <dig> piglets,  <dig> males and  <dig> females, born from  <dig> matings. in addition, cd <dig> genotypes and phenotypes were assigned in  <dig> microminipigs by the pcr-rflp methods and flow cytometry as described above. the percentage and mfi of cd4+ cells in pbmcs were also compared between the two cd <dig> genotypes.

detection of cd <dig> mrna by analyzing rt-pcr products
peripheral blood samples of microminipigs were collected into paxgene blood rna tubes . total rna was extracted using a paxgene blood rna kit . complementary dna  was synthesized from oligo dt primers using total rna and the reverse transcriptase kit, revertra ace .

to characterise the expressed cd <dig> mrna, rt-pcr amplification was performed between exon  <dig> and  <dig> or exon  <dig> and  <dig> by using two specific primer pairs  that were designed from the nucleotide sequence information of two cd <dig> alleles, cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b, obtained from microminpigs and the swine cd <dig> reference sequence . rt-pcr was performed using the same conditions as those used for sequencing amplification. the rt-pcr products were digested with bseri, and electrophoresed in 2 % agarose gel.table  <dig> primers for rt-pcr to detect the expression of cd <dig> mrna




transfection of two kinds of cd <dig> alleles into hela cells
we chose hela cells for the analysis of cd <dig> expression analysis in microminipigs because the same cells have been used for the analysis in human  <cit> . to verify the differences in the antibody reactivity of cd <dig> alleles, hela cells were transfected with the flag-tagged cd <dig> vectors  constructed by adding flag to c-terminus of the two different cd <dig> alleles. pbmcs were isolated from two pigs genotyped to two types of cd <dig> homozygotes using the lymphoprep kit  and their total rnas were extracted with isogen . cdna was synthesized by superscript iii first-strand synthesis system  using a sequence specific reverse primer . rt-pcr was performed with primestar max dna polymerase  and a cd <dig> specific primer pair containing xhoi and noti recognition sequences and flag sequences . the rt-pcr products of cd4-flag were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcaggs  <cit> , and the integrity of the constructed vectors were confirmed by dna sequencing using the following five primers; forward 1: 5′-gcagggacttcctttgtcccaaat-3′; forward 2: 5′- tatctcgagatggacccaggaacctctct-3′; forward 3: 5′-agtcaccctacagtgcaatggaaag-3′; reverse 1: 5′- tatgcggccgctcacttgtcatcgtccttgtaatcggtgagggaatagttcttcttctgttgc-3′; reverse 2: 5′-tgtccttccgagtgagagacacaa-3′. the constructed plasmids were transfected into hela cells using lipofectamine  <dig>  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. after culturing for 20 h, the transfected hela cells were stained with a rabbit anti-flag polyclonal antibody  followed by the alexa fluor  <dig> goat anti-rabbit igg antibody . the pe-conjugated mouse anti-pig cd4a monoclonal antibody  was used for the cd <dig> molecule detection. the cells were also stained with hoechst  <dig> . fluorescence imaging was conducted using scanning laser confocal microscope fv1000-d ix <dig> .

statistical analysis
in the hereditary analysis, the observed and theoretical values were assessed by the chi-squared test using excel  <dig>  with an add-in software statcel  <dig> . theoretical values were determined on the basis of the punnett square. a difference of p <  <dig>  was considered as significant.

RESULTS
pcr amplification of cd <dig> gene sequences between exons  <dig> and  <dig> was performed on  <dig> microminipigs, six pigs that were cd <dig> antibody reactive and five pigs that were cd <dig> antibody unreactive. dna sequencing and analysis of the  <dig> pcr products identified three homozygous and three heterozygous allelic sequences from the six cd <dig> antibody reactive samples, and five homozygous allelic sequences from the five cd <dig> antibody unreactive samples. we aligned the eight homozygous allelic sequences against the swine cd <dig> reference sequence  and identified two distinct allelic nucleotide sequences between exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the cd <dig> genes that we classified as alleles cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b . in comparison with the  sequence, the cd <dig> a  and cd <dig> b  alleles had  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotide substitutions between exon  <dig> and  <dig> regions, respectively . nucleotide sequences identical to cd <dig> a have not been found in genbank, and so far appear to be unique to the microminipigs. in contrast, the nucleotide sequences of cd <dig> b were identical to that of the partial cd <dig>  sequence that reported only exons  <dig> and  <dig> in the cd4-undetectable nih miniature swine   <cit> .table  <dig> the number of nucleotide substitutions in cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b cds compared to

three cd <dig> genotypes in microminipig herd were assigned as cd <dig> aa, ab, and bb by the pcr-rflp method using bseri . the restriction enzyme patterns of cd <dig> aa, ab and bb showed a single band , three bands , and two bands , respectively. the matings of  <dig> pairs of heterozygous parents revealed that the inheritance pattern of cd <dig> genotypes was autosomal . as shown with the flow cytometry results in table  <dig>  pbmcs with cd <dig> aa and ab reacted with the antibody clone 74-12- <dig>  in contrast, pbmcs with cd <dig> bb were unreactive with the antibody. the mfi of cd <dig> ab was approximately half the intensity of cd <dig> aa, even though the percentage of cd4+ cells in pbmcs were not different between the two cd <dig> alleles .fig.  <dig> electrophoretic pattern of pcr-rflp of genomic dna. the lanes are aa: cd <dig> aa; ab: cd <dig> ab; bb: cd <dig> bb; and the 100 bp ladder. the 366 bp-fragment was amplified from genomic dna using primer pair for exon  <dig> . the pcr product was digested with bseri. pcr fragments with genotype of cd <dig> aa, cd <dig> ab, and cd <dig> bb showed single fragment , three fragments , and two fragments , respectively

cd <dig> gene expression was analyzed by rflp using the rt-pcr sequence products that were amplified between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  or between exons  <dig> and  <dig> . rflp distinguished the genotypes cd <dig> aa, cd <dig> bb and cd <dig> ab in both cases. in fig. 4a, the rt-pcr products were detected as a single 400 bp-band by electrophoresis. after bseri digestion, the single band remained in cd4aa, whereas two digested bands of 303 bp and 97 bp were obtained in cd <dig> bb. combinatorial band patterns of cd <dig> aa and cd <dig> bb were observed in cd <dig> a/b. in fig. 4b, the undigested rt-pcr products were detected as a single 595 bp band. after the bseri digestion, the single 595 bp band remained in cd <dig> aa, whereas two digested bands of 300 bp and 295 bp were obtained in cd <dig> bb, and the combinatorial band patterns of cd <dig> aa and cd4bb were observed in cd <dig> a/b. consequently, these results suggested that pbmcs with heterozygous cd <dig> genotype coexpressed cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b alleles at the mrna level.fig.  <dig> electrophoretic pattern of rt-pcr products after enzyme digestion with bseri. the lanes are aa: cd <dig> aa; ab: cd <dig> ab; bb: cd <dig> bb; and the 100 bp ladder. the 400 bp  and 595 bp  of the cd <dig> sequence were amplified from cdna using primer sets shown in table  <dig> and the amplified products were digested with bseri. a after digestion with bseri, cd <dig> aa, cd <dig> ab, and cd <dig> bb showed a 400 bp-fragment , three fragments of  <dig>   <dig> and 97 bp, and two fragments of  <dig> and 97 bp, respectively. b after digestion with bseri, cd <dig> aa, cd <dig> ab, and cd <dig> bb showed a 595 bp-fragment, three fragments of  <dig>   <dig> and 295 bp, and two fragments of  <dig> and 295 bp, respectively




in validating the expression vector sequences, the insertion sequences of cd <dig> a-flag and cd <dig> b-flag were found to be identical to the genomic exon sequences described above  except for the added flag sequence. moreover, we also found a spliced form that lacked the cd <dig> exon  <dig> in both of the two cd <dig> alleles. these spliced forms with the exon  <dig> deficiency gave rise to a stop codon at the n-terminus of transmembrane domain as a result of a frameshift from the beginning of the exon  <dig> region, whereas amino-acid sequences of the external domains in the spliced forms were identical to those of the cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b derived from the nucleotide sequencing using genomic dna . therefore, we used the constructs with complete sequences of cd4-flag for expression in hela cells. these alternative spliced forms were submitted to ddbj  as cd <dig> a exon  <dig> deficiency  and cd <dig> b exon  <dig> deficiency .fig.  <dig> alignment of amino-acid sequences of cd <dig> a-flag and cd <dig> b-flag and their exon  <dig> deficiency forms.  indicates having identical sequence to cd <dig> a-flag. arrow indicates the putative boundary of each exon.  indicates the stop codon. the regions of two extracellular ig-like domains , joining region , transmembrane  domain, cytoplasmic domain and flag are also shown. exon  <dig> deficiency forms gave rise to a stop codon at the n-terminus of tm domain as a result of a frameshift from the beginning of the exon  <dig> region, even though amino-acid sequences of their external cd <dig> domains in the spliced forms were identical to those of cd <dig> a-flag and cd <dig> b-flag. thus, we used the constructs with complete sequences of cd <dig> a-flag and cd <dig> b-flag for the expression study in hela cells




figure  <dig> shows the transient expression of cd4-flag without the exon  <dig> deficiency in hela cells. the cd <dig> a and flag proteins in cd <dig> a-flag were detected with the anti-pig cd <dig> antibody and anti-flag antibody. in contrast, the cd <dig> b in cd <dig> b-flag was unreactive with the anti-pig cd <dig> antibody even though flag was detected with the anti-flag antibody. these results show that we expressed the cd <dig> b protein in hela cells, but that we could not detect it with the anti-cd <dig> antibody.fig.  <dig> expression of the cd4-flag vectors in hela cells. we expressed only the constructs cd4-flag with complete sequences in hela cells as described in fig.  <dig>  a cells stained with rabbit anti-flag antibody followed by alexa fluor  <dig> goat anti-rabbit igg antibody. b cells stained with pe conjugated mouse anti-pig cd <dig> antibody. c cells stained with the overlay of three fluorophore signals; anti-flag antibody, anti-pig cd <dig> antibody, and hoechst 33342




discussion
the cd <dig> exonic sequences of the microminipig cd <dig> gene were analyzed using the dna isolated from cd4+ cells that were cd4-reactive and non-reactive to the 74-12- <dig> antibody, and two corresponding alleles, cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b, respectively, were identified. although the cd <dig> gene is thought to be highly conserved, cd <dig> polymorphisms were reported previously in human, bovine, and ovine . also, two cd <dig> partial allelic sequences were reported in nih miniature swine   <cit> . the nucleotide sequences of exons  <dig> and  <dig> of cd <dig> b in microminipigs were identical to those of cd <dig>  in nih miniature swine. we could not conclude that cd <dig> b is identical to the complete cd <dig> gene sequence of nih miniature swine because only the nucleotides of exons  <dig> and  <dig> were sequenced for cd <dig> . however, the microminipig breed is the result of crosses with western breeds, but it has no consanguinity with the nih miniature swine  <cit> . although the cd <dig> b of microminipigs and cd <dig>  of nih miniature swine might have a co-ancestor, the origins of cd <dig> b and cd <dig>  remain uncertain.

in comparing the amino-acid sequence alignments of cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b with the swine cd <dig> amino-acid reference sequence , we identified one amino-acid substitution in domain  <dig> of the extracellular region of cd <dig> a that involve alterations in the charge of the amino-acid side chain, and consequently a structural change in this domain of cd <dig>  domains  <dig> and  <dig> of cd <dig> play an important role in interacting with the t cell receptor-cd <dig> complex to influence signal transduction in t cell activation and function  <cit> . therefore, the amino-acid substitution on domain  <dig> of cd <dig> a might affect signal transduction and t cell function during the interaction of cd <dig> with the t cell receptor-cd <dig> complex. the five amino-acid substitutions observed in domain  <dig> of cd <dig> b also alter the polarity or charge of amino-acid side chains and might elicit a structural alteration in this domain of the cd <dig>  the domain  <dig> of the cd <dig> combines with the monomorphic region of the mhc molecule in the presentation of antigenic determinants to activate selected lymphocytes  <cit> . moreover, the amino-acid substitutions in the region of domain  <dig> in cd <dig> b correspond to the cdr2-like region of cd <dig>  in nih miniature swine and the cdr2-like region of cd <dig> in humans that bind to mhc class ii molecules and the hiv envelope glycoprotein gp <dig>  <cit> . no clinical abnormalities have been observed as yet with the cd <dig> b genotype in microminipigs, although the affinity of cd <dig> b to mhc class ii might be different from that of cd <dig> a  <cit> . in this regard, the pcr-rflp technique using bseri has allowed us to identify the three cd <dig> genotypes cd <dig> aa, ab and bb that correlated with cd <dig> reactivity to anti-pig cd <dig> antibodies. this simple cd <dig> genotyping method might be useful for selectively breeding cd <dig> a or cd <dig> b homozygous pigs and for developing association studies of immunity to infections and immunologically-related diseases.

our pcr-rflp study has demonstrated that both cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b are co-expressed in pbmc of heterozygous pigs. moreover, the study on the expression of cd4-flag in hela cells confirmed that the amino-acid substitutions in cd <dig> b were associated with the loss of affinity to anti-cd <dig> antibody. on the other hand, the seven amino-acid substitutions observed within cd <dig> a reacted with the anti-cd <dig> antibody and one or other of them are likely to be linear or sequential epitopes recognized by the anti-cd <dig> antibody. therefore, one or more of the ten amino-acid substitutions in domain  <dig> and/or the one amino-acid substitution in joining region  <dig> of cd <dig> b, which are not found in cd <dig> a, may have replaced the antigenic determinant and caused the lose of affinity for the anti-pig cd <dig> antibodies.

the detection of reduced levels of mfi in cd <dig> cells with cd <dig> ab in the microminipigs appears to be due to the anti-cd <dig> antibody reacting with cd <dig> a, but not with the cd <dig> b molecules, if both types of cd <dig> proteins are coexpressed on the surface of helper t cells. moreover, in cd4-flag insertion sequencing, the cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b alleles also had exon  <dig> deficiency forms that lacked the subsequent of transmembrane domain in the deduced amino-acid sequences. thus, if the cd <dig> transcripts are without a transmembrane domain then the translated proteins might be secreted into the serum rather than be bound within the cellular membrane. the alternative spliced forms of cd <dig> cds in swine have not been reported previously even though there are such variants registered in genbank . however, the lack of cd <dig> transmembrane region was reported for a mutant mouse model that secreted soluble cd <dig> without expression of membrane-bound cd <dig>  <cit> . this mouse model was used to show that soluble cd <dig> impaired a delayed-type hypersensitivity response by inhibiting ifn-γ production, and prohibited over-activation of cd4+ t cells by competitive inhibition of the binding of cd <dig> on the t-cell surface to mhc class ii  <cit> . so, if the exon  <dig> deficiency forms are translated to the protein, the secreted cd <dig> might be also associated with prohibiting over-activation of cd4+ t cells in swine. thus, further studies are needed to elucidate the significance of the expression of cd <dig> exon  <dig> deletions.

in nih miniature swine, the functional differences of cd <dig> between cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  were investigated, but no differences were detected in antibody production against staphylococcal nuclease immunization and in the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction  <cit> . in this regard, additional studies will be needed in microminipigs to elucidate the functional significance or immunological importance of polymorphisms of the cd <dig> gene including the possible alternative spliced forms of the expressed gene. because the cd <dig> molecule interacts with the mhc class ii complex in antigen recognition  <cit>  the polymorphisms of both cd <dig> and mhc class ii will need to be considered in future studies. the microminipigs with defined sla haplotypes  <cit>  could be a useful animal model for further research on the interaction between cd <dig> allomorphs and mhc molecules in disease, infection and transplantation studies.

CONCLUSIONS
two cd <dig> alleles, named as cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b, were identified in microminipigs, and these two alleles were found to express an exon  <dig> deficiency, indicating the potential for alternative spliced forms. the loss of reactivity of antigenic epitopes to an anti-cd <dig> antibody probably resulted because of amino-acid substitutions in cd <dig> b. these cd <dig> polymorphisms could be genotyped and identified simply by the pcr-rflp technique using bseri in microminipigs.
