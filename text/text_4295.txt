BACKGROUND
invertebrate immune systems have been shown to include highly diversified recognition systems, complex regulatory processes, and specific effectors . however, the functioning and evolutionary history of immune-related genes remains unknown for most invertebrate species.

for example, the recent sequencing of the first aphid genome  provided new insights into insect immunity but also raised novel evolutionarily- and functionally-intriguing questions  <cit> . indeed, genes participating in the immune responses of other insects are missing in aphids, such as the microbial recognition genes pgrps  involved in the recognition of both gram-negative and -positive bacteria  <cit> . even more intriguing is the absence of most of the components of the immunodeficiency  signaling pathway, which is critical for fighting gram-negative bacteria, and the absence of most of the antimicrobial peptides conserved in other insects  <cit> . these results, further supported by expression studies  <cit> , showed that the aphid immune system greatly differs from that of other well studied insects and it was hypothesized that aphids compensate for a deficient immune system by symbiont-mediated host protection and an extraordinary reproduction rate  <cit> . aphids are plant sap-feeding insects associated with the obligatory nutrient-providing symbiont buchnera aphidicola
 <cit> . aphids also interact with several species of facultative bacterial endosymbionts  <cit>  that are found free in the hemolymph  <cit> . interestingly, secondary symbionts have been shown to influence important fitness-related traits such as body pigmentation  <cit> , offspring production  <cit>  and resistance to parasitoids  or pathogens  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that these intimate aphid-symbiont interactions may have led to the loss of specific antibacterial compounds or pathways to accommodate long-term host-symbiont coevolution and symbiont maintenance  <cit> .

an additional possibility to avoid elimination of mutualistic symbionts is a fine-tuning of the host immune response  <cit> . aphid immune system may be particularly well regulated to prevent or limit damage to their bacterial mutualists under pathogen infections. as a first approach to explore this hypothesis, we searched a. pisum genome for immune regulators, and we noticed the existence of five genes coding for macrophage migration inhibitory factors  within the a. pisum genome. in vertebrates, mifs are important pro-inflammatory cytokines acting on key cellular processes of the immune response such as cell proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . mifs were identified in a variety of species, including protozoan, nematode, mollusk and crustacean species . it was shown that a mollusk mif  not only presented the expected activities on cell proliferation and apoptosis but played a major role in the response against parasitic infection  <cit> . this study provided functional evidence of the conservation of major immune-related functions of mifs in an invertebrate and highlighted the importance of these immune regulators in invertebrate immunity  <cit> . interestingly, all species investigated so far presented one or two mif gene copies. the existence of additional mif copies in a. pisum therefore requires dedicated evolutionary and functional analyses to better understand the complex immune interactions of aphids with their symbionts and pathogens.

here we characterized a. pisum mif members and explored their existence and evolutionary history in various insect phyla. to gain insights into their functional role, we analyzed the expression of the several mif copies during aphid-symbiont-pathogen interactions.

RESULTS
acyrthosiphon pisummif family members
the search for predicted mif gene sequences in the annotated genome of acyrthosiphon pisum
 <cit>   revealed  <dig> mif members referred to as apmif <dig> to apmif <dig> . using blast searches  <cit> , we found one or several full-length ests for each apmif member supporting their existence, structural annotation and expression. complementary searches evidenced an additional hit, corresponding to a 6th mif gene that was actually annotated in a previous version of the genome assembly  . blast searches using the originally predicted apmif <dig> cdna sequence against the  <dig> redundant ests resulted in a partial and fragmented alignment with only  <dig> similar ests that did not support the existence of a full length transcript from a 6th mif gene. in order to further characterize apmif members, rt-pcr amplification of the complete coding sequences of the predicted apmif genes was performed from rna of two genetically different lineages of a. pisum . amplicons were obtained and resequenced for apmif <dig> to - <dig>  sequence results confirmed the expression of full length transcripts of apmif <dig> to apmif <dig>  amplification of a full length cdna from apmif <dig>  was however not obtained.table  <dig>

experimental validation  consisted in the amplification and resequencing of cdnas.



the five predicted apmif proteins showed highly significant hits with macrophage migration inhibitory factor domain  . interestingly, sequences of the  <dig> apmif predicted proteins differ considerably among each other  and present 33% to 55% similarity in their sequences. mif proteins from mammals and snails have been shown to catalyze the ketoenol isomerization of small aromatic substrates such as hydroxyphenylpyruvate and l-dopachrome methyl ester  <cit> . post-translational cleavage of the initiating methionine exposes an n-terminal catalytic proline  that is essential for mif tautomerase activity  <cit> . three of the five predicted apmif proteins present this proline <dig> residue as well as other conserved residues such as lys <dig>  ile <dig> and tyr <dig> and val <dig>  participating to mif active sites  <cit>  . another conserved feature of mif proteins is to be secreted via non-classical pathways, involving, for example an atp binding cassette transporter  <cit> . as expected, no signal peptides were detected in apmif sequences  but the secretomep server  <cit>  predicted apmif  <dig> and apmif  <dig> as secreted proteins .

mif family members in insects
in order to further characterize this multigenic family, we first searched for mif genes in sequenced insect genomes. intriguingly, with the exception of two mif genes in tribolium castaneum and in bombyx mori, no mif genes were identified from the other insect genomes available at the time of the study . we then performed an extensive search for mif transcripts from  <dig> hemipteran species  with available ests in public databases. interestingly, mif transcripts were detected, in particular, in phloem-sap feeding species belonging to the delphacidae, aphididae, pemphigidae, pseudococcidae and psyllidae families . mif genes were identified in all aphididae with available ests with up to  <dig> members. note that except for a. pisum the number of mif members is probably underestimated due to the absence of annotated genomic data and to the modest size of some of the transcriptomic databases. aphid genomic and transcriptomic data are currently growing rapidly and will allow a complete identification of aphid mif members in a close future.table  <dig>

phylogenic reconstruction of complete predicted mif sequences from hemipterans was performed using the crustacean daphnia pulex as an outgroup . with the exception of a. pisum apmif <dig>  all predicted mif proteins from delphacidae and aphididae clustered into five clades including one clade specific of delphacidae and  <dig> clades specific of aphididae . each apmif member clustered into one of the four clades, together with mif members from other aphid species , showing that several duplications occurred before the diversification of aphids but after the split of aphididae from the other hemipterans.figure  <dig>

further studies on apmif expression were carried out on the  <dig> apmifs. however, because expression levels of apmif <dig> and apmif <dig> remained at the limit of detection by real time quantitative rt-pcr in each experiment, they are not presented in the following result sections.

increased apmifexpression after immune challenges
to explore the expected involvement of apmif genes in aphid immune response, we examined their expression levels after immune challenges. we first used aphidius ervi, which is the main parasitoid of a. pisum in the field  <cit> . the two clones of a. pisum showed a significant increase in apmif <dig>  apmif <dig> and apmif <dig> transcript levels after exposure to female parasitoid . an increased apmif expression is also observed in aphids after injection with the gram-negative bacteria e. coli .figure  <dig>

decreased apmifexpression during interactions with mutualistic symbionts
we first compared the expression levels of apmif transcripts in the three lineages derived from yr <dig> and each harbouring a specific secondary symbiont . aphids carrying mutualistic symbionts showed lower expression levels of apmif <dig>  apmif <dig> and apmif <dig> . in order to further study changes in apmif expression in presence of secondary symbionts, we measured apmif expression levels in ll <dig> following the injection of each of the three secondary symbionts. since it was reported that injection of hemolymph from infected to uninfected a. pisum can establish a stable infection of secondary facultative symbionts  <cit> , each secondary symbiont was manually collected from yr <dig> lineages and injected into ll <dig> adults. apmif expression was measured  <dig> and 4 days after injection. apmif <dig>  apmif <dig> and apmif <dig> expression levels rapidly decreased after infection as compared to controls injected with schneider medium . to ascertain that experimental infections with the facultative symbionts were successful, individuals from the f <dig> progeny of injected adults were microscopically examined. presence of bacteria in the hemolymph confirmed the establishment of these vertically transmitted symbionts, and analyses of apmifs expression levels confirmed that their decreased expression persisted in the f <dig> progeny . altogether, these results showed that the establishment and the presence of the three major facultative symbionts of a. pisum correlate with a decreased expression of the three well-expressed apmif genes.figure  <dig>

apmifexpression during both agonistic and antagonistic interactions
because some secondary symbionts can impact important aphid fitness-related traits such as resistance to parasitoids  or pathogens  <cit> , it may be disadvantageous for aphids to mount a complete immune response in the presence of both these mutualists and a pathogen or parasitoid. similarly, if the negative regulation of aphid immune response results from a direct effect of mutualists on host immune system, one may expect that this regulation would be maintained after an immune challenge and would limit the increase in apmif expression. to test this hypothesis, apmif expression levels were analyzed after exposure to parasitoids in the yr <dig> lineages carrying each of the three facultative symbionts. no significant change in gene expression was observed for apmif <dig> . increased expressions were observed for apmif <dig> and apmif <dig> after exposure to the parasitoid a. ervi , the highest expression levels being observed in the yr2-ss lineage. however, all expression levels remained far below those of the yr <dig> lineage without mutualistic symbionts .figure  <dig>

discussion
widespread lineage-specific gene duplications have been observed in the a. pisum genome  <cit> . the number of duplications in this aphid appears greater than that of any other sequenced insect with over  <dig> gene families that have undergone gene duplication  <cit> . however, these duplications were not reported to particularly affect immune-related genes, and, on the contrary, important and conserved genes of the antibacterial pathways are missing from a. pisum genome  <cit> .

a specific search for mif genes in genomes from insects revealed that except for tribolium castaneum and bombyx mori, no other genome contained mif members. conversely, analysis of hemipteran transcriptomic databases provided evidence for the existence of a mif multigenic family in aphididae species as well as for the existence of at least  <dig> mif members in delphacidae species. phylogenic reconstruction of complete predicted mif sequences from hemipterans showed that sequences clustered into five clades including one clade specific of delphacidae and  <dig> clades specific of aphididae. each aphididae clade contained closely related mif members from several aphid species showing that duplications occurred before the diversification of aphids. altogether, these results showed that losses occurred in most insect phyla while both differential losses and duplications occurred within the hemiptera phylum. this differential loss versus duplication, together with the previously observed absence of important immune-related genes in a. pisum genome, raised the question of the functional significance of mif members in aphididae.

detection of the apmif transcripts in aphid whole bodies and hemocytes is consistent with the expected expression of these cytokines. mammalian mifs are expressed in various cell types, including all immune-relevant tissues  and macrophages  <cit> . in mammals, mif genes are constitutively expressed and the protein is stored in granules of immune-relevant cells and rapidly secreted in extracellular fluids upon challenge  <cit> . here we showed that apmif proteins are also detected in immune cell granules, suggesting that they are stored and secreted upon challenge. in addition to the expression localization, the significant increase in apmif expression after immune challenges support the role of these genes in promoting and regulating major early processes of the innate immune response  <cit> . mifs are pleiotropic proteins involved in numerous cellular processes and are key cytokines controlling the response to both parasitic and bacterial infections  <cit> . the over-expression of apmifs was observed in two distinct aphid clones and after exposure to both parasitoids and pathogenic bacteria, supporting a general involvement of apmifs in aphid’s immune response, regardless of the aphid genetic background or of the pathogen.

interestingly, a lower expression of apmif genes was observed either constitutively or after immune challenge in aphid lineages infected by one of the three tested secondary symbionts . a recent study showed that the number of a. pisum hemocytes is significantly smaller in yr <dig> lineages carrying these secondary symbionts as compared with the yr <dig> lineage without secondary symbionts  <cit> . the decreased expression levels of mif genes that we observed in these yr <dig> lineages may therefore result partly from their smaller hemocyte number and partly from a down regulation of expression.

these results are consistent with previous observations on the association between the weevil sitophilus and the sitophilus primary endosymbiont   <cit> . in contrast to aphids, weevil immune system presents several families of conserved antimicrobial peptides  <cit>  and it was shown that the antimicrobial peptide coleoptericin-a  inhibits bacterial cell division and is essential in the regulation of endosymbiont number and location  <cit> . in addition, although expression of antimicrobial peptides  was similar in symbiotic  and aposymbiotic larvae, a lower amp gene expression was observed after immune challenge with e. coli in symbiotic insects  <cit> . here, we observed a negative effect of symbionts on expression of another type of immune genes in aphids, further supporting the importance of immune gene expression in regulating both agonistic and antagonistic interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study shows that members of the macrophage migration inhibitory factor  present a complex evolutionary history characterized by differential losses and duplications across insect phyla.

the  <dig> mif members of a. pisum are functional, expressed in circulating immune cells and differently regulated during a pathogenic or mutualistic interaction.

this work provides evidence that while aphid’s antibacterial arsenal is reduced, immune regulators widely absent from insect genomes are present, diversified and differentially regulated during antagonistic or agonistic interactions. this supports the hypothesis of a fine-tuning of the immune response possibly accommodating both symbiont maintenance and response to aggressors.
