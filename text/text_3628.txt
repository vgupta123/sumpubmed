BACKGROUND
eosinophils have been proposed to play various roles in homeostasis, ranging from their involvement in tissue development to directing or facilitating innate and adaptive immune responses  <cit> . there is also a great body of evidence implicating eosinophils as central effector cells in parasitic and allergic disease. while there is sound evidence that demonstrates the contribution of eosinophils to host defence against parasitic infections  <cit> , controversy still remains regarding the functional role played by eosinophils in allergic diseases such as asthma  <cit> . this is largely based on inconsistencies between work in animal models and the human disease and the inability to effectively target eosinophils. for example, clinical resolution of human asthma could not be demonstrated by targeting eosinophils with anti-il- <dig> therapy  <cit> , despite the many studies in animal models that have shown the success of il- <dig> neutralization in blocking experimental asthma  <cit> . it has subsequently been shown that pathways independent of il- <dig> are relevant for eosinophil development or recruitment to sites of allergic inflammation  <cit> .

the study of eosinophils in parasitic and allergic diseases has relied largely on the use of cytochemical stains that react with distinctive basic cytoplasmic granules of the eosinophil. granule release or degranulation that commonly follows eosinophil recruitment into inflamed tissues, however, often limits use of cytochemical stains for the study of eosinophils.

in recent years, the use of monoclonal antibodies  has been applied to the study of eosinophils and their functional role both in vivo and ex vivo. eosinophils are known to express a range of membrane receptors enabling cell-cell communication, including receptors for adhesion molecules, immunoglobulins and soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines  <cit> . some mabs shown to be useful for identifying eosinophils, though not entirely specific for eosinophils, have included the il- <dig> receptor, chemokine receptor- <dig>  and the basic granule proteins, major basic protein  and eosinophil cationic protein   <cit> .

sheep are the natural host to a range of helminthic parasites and therefore represent a relevant model to study the role of eosinophils in parasite immunity  <cit> . sheep models of allergic inflammation have also been used for the study of eosinophils  <cit> . as in other species, ovine eosinophils have been shown to express a range of leukocyte surface markers including cd11a, cd11b, cd11c, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd62l  <cit> . however, none of these proteins are expressed exclusively by eosinophils and to date, there are no mabs that identify eosinophils in isolation in any species.

given the close lineage relationship of granulocytes it is not surprising that a number of mabs raised against cell surface components of eosinophils also show reactivity with other granulocytes. most recently, siglec- <dig> was reported to be the first identified eosinophil-exclusive surface receptor  <cit> , however, a subsequent report demonstrated expression on basophils and mast cells  <cit> . other examples include mabs directed against eosinophil mbp and ecp that are also reactive with other granulocyte populations  <cit> . a major impediment to the generation of eosinophil-exclusive mabs has been the inherent difficulty in gaining access to reasonable numbers of eosinophils of sufficient purity. the aim of this study was to use a sheep model of allergic inflammation to source large numbers of eosinophils and use these for the generation of mabs specific for ovine eosinophils.

RESULTS
preparation of purified eosinophils
eosinophils used for mab production and screening were sourced from sheep mammary glands that were primed and stimulated with haemonchus contortus l <dig> larvae. differential cell counts of cytospots showed that mammary lavage  cells consisted of mostly eosinophils , lymphocytes  and macrophages  . mal cells analysed by flow cytometry appeared as three distinct cell populations distinguished on the basis of their forward scatter  and side scatter  properties , enabling mabs to be screened for reactivity with the gated cell populations. the gated eosinophil population  was sorted using a flow cytometer and analysis of cytospins confirmed the high purity  of eosinophils .

selection of monoclonal antibodies reactive with ovine eosinophils
mabs reactive with sheep eosinophils were generated following mouse immunisations with preparations of eosinophil soluble lysate, granule extract, or whole live sorted cells.

two fusions were performed from mice immunised with the soluble lysate and resulting hybridoma cell supernatants screened against eosinophil and neutrophil soluble lysates by western blot. the mab  <dig>   was selected as it showed reactivity with eosinophils but not neutrophils.

following fusions of spleen cells from mice immunised with eosinophil granule extracts, hybridoma supernatants were screened against eosinophil and neutrophil granule extracts by western blot and eosinophil and neutrophil mal cytospots by immunocytohemistry. two clones reactive with eosinophils and neutrophils, designated mab  <dig>   and mab  <dig>  , were characterised as granulocyte-specific markers.

a total of three fusions were performed with mouse spleen cells following immunisation of mice with whole eosinophils. hybridoma supernatants were screened against mal cells by flow cytometry and mab  <dig>   was chosen for its reactivity with eosinophils.

surface and intracellular staining of leukocytes with monoclonal antibodies against ovine eosinophils
flow cytometry was used to assess whether the mabs generated were reactive with cell surface or intracellular molecules . furthermore, by gating on individual leukocyte populations within blood and mal, the specificity of the mabs was analysed. reactivity was measured by the percentage positive reactivity relative to that observed with an isotype-matched control mab, and the relative mean fluorescence intensity .

ยง western blot  analysis ; flow cytometry analysis for surface  and intracellular  reactivity; immunohistochemistry  performed on cytospots , and frozen  and paraffin-embedded  tissue sections fixed in 95% ethanol.

- no reactivity; + moderate reactivity; ++ strong reactivity

mab  <dig>  showed no surface staining of any of the gated cell populations in peripheral blood or mal including eosinophils  and neutrophils  when compared to an isotype matched control. however, following permeabilisation of cells to detect intracellular reactivity, mab  <dig>  showed clear positive intracellular staining of blood and mal eosinophils , but not neutrophils , lymphocytes, monocytes or macrophages from peripheral blood, lymph node, mal and bronchoalveolar lavage  samples .

in contrast, mab  <dig>  showed weak surface staining of mal eosinophils  and following permeabilisation greater than 98% of eosinophils showed intracellular staining . exclusive reactivity with eosinophils was confirmed by gating neutrophils , lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages from peripheral blood, lymph node, mal and bal samples which were unstained both on their surface and intracellularly .

expression of the antigen identified by the mabs  <dig>  and  <dig>  did not appear to be affected by eosinophil maturation and/or activation status as there was no change in staining intensity observed comparing eosinophils collected from bone marrow, peripheral blood and mal .

the reactivity of the granulocyte mabs  was examined on leukocytes in mal and peripheral blood by flow cytometry. the mab  <dig>  showed no surface staining of cells, however, there was positive intracellular staining seen with both eosinophils  and neutrophils , with stronger relative staining apparent in neutrophils. in contrast, mab  <dig>  did not appear to show any reactivity with leukocytes by flow cytometry.

immunocytochemical staining and tissue distribution of eosinophils reactive with monoclonal antibodies  <dig>  and  <dig> 
the tissue distribution of eosinophils reactive with the mabs  <dig>  and  <dig>  was assessed by immunocytochemistry on cytospin preparations and in tissues . cytospin preparations of peripheral blood and mal leukocytes confirmed the pattern of reactivity observed by flow cytometry . peripheral blood and mal eosinophils showed intense intracellular staining with the mabs  <dig>   and  <dig>   while all other leukocytes were unstained. in contrast, the granulocyte-specific mabs  <dig>  and  <dig>  showed intense staining of peripheral blood eosinophils and neutrophils in peripheral blood  and mal .

sheep tissues displaying high eosinophil levels due to parasite or allergic challenge  were sectioned and stained for reactivity with the mabs  <dig>  and  <dig> . lung tissue was collected following allergen challenge while abomasal  and associated lymph node tissues were obtained from a gastrointestinal parasite infected sheep. both mabs showed optimal staining when tissues were fixed in ethanol, compared with paraformaldehyde or formalin. mab  <dig>  stained eosinophils equally well on frozen and paraffin embedded tissues, while staining with mab  <dig>  was optimal on frozen sections. positive staining identified eosinophils in each of the tissues examined, with other leukocytes and tissue components unstained . however, staining with mab  <dig>  in many cases appeared more diffuse compared to reactivity seen with mab  <dig> . there did not appear to be any evidence of reactivity with tissue mast cells or basophils in normal or pathological tissues.

cross reactivity of mabs  <dig>  and  <dig>  with eosinophils from other species was assessed on cell and tissue preparations  by immunocytochemistry. both mabs showed cross-reactivity with goat peripheral blood eosinophils while the mab  <dig>  also recognised cow eosinophils. no reactivity was detected with either mab in cell and tissue samples sourced from murine  or human  subjects.

western blot analysis with eosinophil-specific monoclonal antibodies
the reactivity of the mabs as assessed by western blot analysis is summarised in table  <dig>  no reactivity of the mab  <dig>  was detected by western blot. in contrast, western blotting was used in the screening and selection of mab  <dig>  and could therefore be used to characterise the molecules recognised by mab  <dig>  in different sample preparations . whole cell extracts from relatively pure  preparations of eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages were analysed by western blot under reducing conditions. extracts were prepared from an equal number of cells and identical blots probed with either mab  <dig>  or a negative control mab. the eosinophil whole cell extract showed reactivity with a band of approximately  <dig> kda, while no reactivity was detected in neutrophil, lymphocyte or macrophage extracts . western blot analysis of the granulocyte-specific mabs  <dig>  and  <dig>  showed reactivity with multiple bands  in eosinophil soluble and granule lysate preparations .

discussion
in the present study, we employed a sheep model of inflammation to provide access to large numbers of relatively pure eosinophils  <cit> , required for mab production and characterisation. mice were immunised with either whole eosinophils, eosinophil soluble lysate or granule extract and the resulting mabs were selected on the basis of their reactivity with eosinophils. these studies produced a panel of mabs with reactivity for eosinophils alone  and both eosinophils and neutrophils .

the first eosinophil specific mab  <dig>  produced recognises eosinophils in bone marrow, peripheral blood and the inflamed mammary gland compartment, both by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. in fact, following their recruitment in response to allergic stimuli, all eosinophils  were stained by this mab. selection of mab  <dig>  was based on surface reactivity of mammary lavage  eosinophils, although the reactive protein was subsequently shown  to be present both on the cell surface and intracellularly. it is not uncommon for intracellular molecules to also be detected on the surface of cells, as has been shown to be the case with eosinophil derived neurotoxin , previously considered to be intracellular but recently identified at low levels on the surface of eosinophils  <cit> . the exclusive reactivity of mab  <dig>  at comparable levels on all eosinophils at different tissue sites suggests that this mab would be suitable as a diagnostic tool for the discrimination of eosinophils in sheep.

the second eosinophil-specific mab, mab  <dig> , proved useful for the discrimination of eosinophils by flow cytometry and immunocytochemical staining. there was little variation in the level of staining when comparing cells from bone marrow, blood and mal, although in contrast to mab  <dig> , not all eosinophils stained positive with the mab  <dig> . a consistent, albeit small , population of unstained cells was seen in all sites tested. further, the  <dig> kda protein identified in eosinophil lysates by mab  <dig>  could not be detected by western blot in mal fluid following eosinophil recruitment or in vitro in the culture supernatant of eosinophils stimulated to degranulate as measured by eosinophil peroxidase release , suggesting the protein is not being released by eosinophils. this is in contrast to galectin- <dig>  an exclusive product of eosinophils, which is released into the brochoalveolar  fluid after allergen challenge  <cit> .

the application of mab  <dig>  and mab  <dig>  for immunocytochemistry allowed eosinophils to be detected in various tissues. strong reactivity was detected in frozen tissue sections, while in fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, positive staining was detected after ethanol fixation but not with the use of formaldehyde-based fixatives. the widespread use of mabs to identify eosinophils has included antibodies reactive with the il- <dig> receptor, cc chemokine receptor- <dig>  and the granule proteins mbp and ecp  <cit> . however, none of these markers are expressed exclusively by eosinophils. with the mabs generated in the present study, and our earlier report describing a novel eosinophil-specific galectin  <cit> , sheep are to date the only species in which eosinophil exclusive mabs are available.

the identity of the antigens reactive with the eosinophil-specific mabs generated in the present study is yet to be determined. the major constituents of the secondary granules, generally low molecular weight proteins, are amongst the best-characterised intracellular proteins of the eosinophil. these include the cytotoxic cationic granule proteins, as well as an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and lipid mediators  <cit> . it was found that mab  <dig>  identified a protein band at  <dig> kda in eosinophil lysates, much greater than the molecular weight of known granule components. it seems that both mab  <dig>  and  <dig>  do not react with specific granules but as yet unidentified eosinophil constituents. the identification of these antigens, a current focus in our laboratory, will be required to characterise the role of these molecules in eosinophil-associated pathologies.

the mabs generated in the present studies will assist the study of ruminant eosinophils ex vivo and in vivo. with the use of appropriate models of parasite and allergic disease, these mabs may be shown to be effective for the inhibition of eosinophils or their effector functions, and contribute to our understanding of the role of eosinophils in protection against infection and disease pathology.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, two mabs that identify sheep eosinophil and neutrophil granules and two eosinophil exclusive mabs have been produced. the mabs  <dig>  and  <dig>  react with eosinophils but not lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils or macrophages. an eosinophil exclusive mab has great potential as a tool for eosinophil research as to date there are limited reagents available for identifying eosinophils. other mabs generated here were found to be reactive for both eosinophils and neutrophils . the study of immunological responses of sheep to parasite infections, where eosinophils are implicated, and in sheep models of allergic inflammation will now be greatly facilitated by the development of these eosinophil specific reagents.
