BACKGROUND
the first plant gene encoding a cellulose synthase catalytic subunit  was identified in  <dig> in cotton based on its sequence similarity to a bacterial cesa  <cit> . in  <dig>  richmond and somerville identified  <dig> cesa genes and  <dig> cellulose synthases-like  genes in arabidopsis, which were further classified into one cesa family and six csl families  based on phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . since then, the whole cesa and csl gene repertoire has been cataloged in fully sequenced plants, including rice  <cit> , poplar  <cit>  and the moss physcomitrella patens  <cit> . additional cesa and csl genes have also been found in diverse and not fully sequenced land plants such as maize  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and pine  <cit> ; cesas have been identified in streptophyte green algae such as mesotaenium caldariorum  <cit>  and in red alga porphyra yezoensis  <cit>  as well. two additional csl families  were found in these studies; together with the other six csl families and one cesa family, they comprise the cesa superfamily.

the cesa superfamily genes are among the most important players involved in the biosynthesis of plant cell walls, which are mainly composed of biopolymers such as celluloses, hemicelluloses, pectins and lignins. because the csl genes share sequence similarities with the cesa genes, they are hypothesized to be involved in the biosynthesis of the backbone of various polysaccharide polymers  <cit> , in particular hemicelluloses  <cit> . this so-called "csl hypothesis" has been supported by recent experimental studies, which suggest that the csla genes encode the mannan synthases  <cit> , the cslf and cslh genes encode the mixed linkage glucan synthases  <cit> , and the cslc genes are probably involved in the xyloglucan biosynthesis  <cit> . therefore the backbone synthases of all major hemicellulose classes except for xylans are known. however, the functional roles of the other csl families  remain unclear.

the phylogenetic classification and the function of the cesa superfamily were reviewed by lerouxel et al. in  <dig>  <cit> , and since then there have been a few updates in terms of the phylogenetic analyses of these important genes. fincher et al. have found a new csl family  in cereals  <cit> . roberts and bushoven have mined the p. pattens genomic and est data and found cesa, csla, cslc and csld genes in this lower plant  <cit> ; their phylogenetic analyses revealed that seven p. patens cesa genes form a monophyletic clade by themselves and there are no one-to-one orthologs in the moss corresponding to the arabidopsis cesa triplet subunits . furthermore, comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the plant cesa superfamily by including cesas from other organismal groups  indicated that plant csla and cslc genes have a different origin than the remaining plant genes  <cit> . evidences have been reported that these remaining genes of the cesa superfamily were anciently acquired from cyanobacteria  <cit> . it was proposed  <cit>  that the plant cslg genes evolved first, followed by the csle, cslb, cesa and csld/f genes. however, a more recent study could not find homologs of the cslg/e/b/h/f genes in p. patens  <cit> , suggesting that these csl families are narrowly distributed and unlikely to be the earliest evolved.

to date  <dig> plant and algal genomes have been fully or nearly fully sequenced, and their gene prediction and annotation are publicly available . the availability of these genomes and their annotated genes facilitates comparative genomic studies of plants, making it possible to address major plant biology questions in silico  <cit> . we have performed comparative analyses of the cesa superfamily genes in the  <dig> sequenced plant and algal genomes. our goals are to define cesa and csl gene homologs across these genomes and to investigate the evolution of different csl gene families. we have built a catalog of all the csl genes and classified them phylogenetically. the gene structure, the evolutionary rate, and the distribution of the csl families across different genomes are also studied. throughout this paper, we use csl genes to denote all cellulose synthases-like genes including cesas.

RESULTS
identification of csl proteins
we analyzed the csl genes in the  <dig> genomes based on blast  <cit>  and hmmer  <cit>  searches . we found that all predicted csl proteins contain either the pfam cellulose_synt domain  or the glycosyltransferase family  <dig>  domain  but not both. for example, all csla and cslc proteins in arabidopsis have the gt <dig> domain but not the cellulose_synt domain, while all other arabidopsis csl proteins contain only the cellulose_synt domain, which is consistent with a previous finding that csla and cslc have a different origin than the other csl families  <cit> . we then grouped all proteins with the gt <dig> domain into a set denoted as the gt <dig> dataset, and those with the cellulose_synt domain into the cellulose_synt dataset. these two datasets do not share any common proteins.

by querying the pfam cellulose_synt domain, we identified two cyanobacterial proteins from the fully sequenced bacterial genomes. these two proteins were originally identified by nobles et al. in  <dig>  <cit> , and here are used to root the eukaryotic cellulose_synt phylogeny.

phylogenetic classification of csl families
to characterize the identified csl genes from the  <dig> genomes, we built phylogenetic trees for each of the two aforementioned datasets, based on the multiple sequence alignments of both the full length proteins and the conserved pfam domains . figures 1a and 1b show the un-rooted maximum likelihood  trees for the cellulose_synt dataset and the gt <dig> dataset, respectively. the number and the species information of the genes included in the phylogeny are given in table  <dig>  neighbor joining  trees for the two datasets were also constructed and given in the additional file  <dig> .

a) see table  <dig> for species full names

b) genome size is measured as the number of protein coding genes in each genome.

c) atcsla <dig> was not identified in our hmmsearch , and thus the number of csl genes in arabidopsis is shown to be  <dig> instead of  <dig> 

the number of proteins in each csl family, calculated based on their groupings as shown in figure  <dig>  is given in table  <dig>  no csl genes were detected in the three stramenopile algae  and the red alga cyanidioschyzon merolae. only one single-copy gene, which is most closely related to csla/c, was identified in each of the six green algae. overall,  <dig> proteins from land plants have the gt <dig> pfam domain, which are assigned to either the csla or the cslc family . six additional proteins from green algae also have the gt <dig> pfam domain and are the most homologous to both the land plant csla and cslc genes. the cellulose_synt pfam domain is found in  <dig> proteins, which are assigned to the other csl families . based on their taxonomic distribution and the phylogenies shown in figure  <dig>  we have divided the  <dig> identified csl proteins into three categories. the first category consists of csla and cslc, the most conserved csl families in our analyses. these families are found in all seven land plants and all six green algae sampled in this study. the second category contains three phylogenetically related families, cesa, csld and cslf . among these families, cslf is specific to grasses while cesa and csld are present across all the sampled land plants, including the two lower plants . the last category includes the remaining csl families, which appear to be confined to the five sampled seed plants . such a restricted distribution suggests a likely late origin of these csl families and possible functional roles specific to seed plants.

cslj represents a new csl family that is found in both monocot and dicot plants
protein sequences of the cslj members  were queried to search against the ncbi est database. with e-value cutoff <= 1e- <dig>  est matches that are >98% identical to the query protein and are from the same species as the query were collected and listed in the second column. these ests matches were manually checked at the ncbi website to find unigene links  and tissue/organ expression information  if they have.

a green algae-specific family
six green algal csl genes  form a well-supported group distinct from the land plant csla and cslc genes . inasmuch this green algal csl group possibly represents the most homologous genes of the common ancestor of csla and cslc in all the land plants.

evolutionary rate of csl families
the ratio between ka and ks  has been widely used to measure the selection pressure on proteins  <cit> . generally, a lower selection pressure indicates a higher evolutionary rate. using ka, ks and the ka/ks ratio as proxies, people have found significant correlations between protein evolutionary rates and numerous features derivable from genome sequences, such as the number of protein-protein interaction partners, gene expression levels, the essentiality of a gene and the number of paralogs of a gene  <cit>  . in particular, genes that originated relatively recently through gene duplications or by other mechanisms usually evolve more rapidly than the more ancient genes  <cit> . in order to compare the relative evolutionary rates among the csl families that may have come into being through duplications  <cit> , we have calculated the ka/ks ratios  and conducted rigorous statistical analyses on the computational results.

the comparisons of the distribution of the ka/ks ratios across different csl families are shown in figure 2aâ€“d, from which it is clear that the narrowly distributed csl families  tend to have higher ka/ks ratios than those widely distributed csl families . this observation is statistically supported by pair-wise wilcoxon tests . interestingly, this observation remains to be true when we compared the genes of the csl families across different groupings of the plant genomes, namely across  all the seven land plants ,  the five seed plants ; figure 2b),  the three dicot plants ,  the two monocot plants , and  each of the seven plants . specifically, we found that the dicot-specific cslb and cslg families have evolved the most rapidly, followed by the monocot-specific cslh, and then by the seed plant-specific csle and cslj. in addition, the monocot-specific cslf has evolved significantly more rapidly than cslc and cesa, but not than csla and csld . overall, we found that the cslb/h/e/g/j families have evolved more rapidly than the other csl families, which lends further support for the hypothesis that these families might have diversified relatively recently to acquire new functions specific to the seed plants.

in a hypothesis testing, a p-value is usually calculated to indicate if the null hypothesis is statistically supported. in this case, genes of csl families in the column are tested against those in the row in terms of their ka/ks values. the null hypothesis is that the column is equal to the row, and the alternative hypothesis is that the column is larger than the row. if the p-value is less than  <dig> , the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is statistically significantly supported. this table shows that except for a very few cases , the columns are always significantly larger than the rows.

comparative study of individual csl families
we have compared the csl genes across different plant genomes by inspecting the phylogeny of each family and analyzing the gene structures. we present here a detailed comparative analysis of the less studied and narrowly distributed cslb/h/e/g/j families. the analyses of the other csl families are given in the additional file  <dig> .

a) csle family
the phylogeny and the gene structure of the csle family are shown in figure  <dig>  while there is only one csle gene in arabidopsis, nine copies of the gene are found in the recently sequenced grape genome . six of these grape genes form a monophyletic group, and are located on the chromosome in tandem within a ~ <dig> kb region, which apparently resulted from a tandem duplication event. all these grape genes have ka/ks ratios between  <dig> ~ <dig>   and have est data in genbank, suggesting that they are functionally active. the grass genes form a large group on the phylogeny, suggesting that csle diverged separately after the split of dicots and monocots.

b) cslg and cslj families
these two families are closely related to each other in the phylogeny shown in figure  <dig>  genes of the dicot-specific cslg family  <cit>  form mostly genome-specific monophyletic clusters , and have conserved gene structures. this suggests that the cslg family diversified separately in each dicot plant via intragenomic duplications. similar to csle, this family is also substantially expanded in the grape genome possibly as a result of tandem gene duplications . the  <dig> grape cslg genes have ka/ks ratios between  <dig> ~ <dig> ; nine of them have ests in genbank, and one has more than ten identical ests . the est data indicate that this gene is expressed mostly in grape leaves, although further experimental studies are clearly needed to determine if any of these duplicated genes is actually functional.cslj is possibly a new family according to recent studies  <cit>  and our current analyses. although cslj is closely related to cslg, these two families have very different gene structures . in addition, unlike other families, the cslj genes appear to be less conserved in their gene structures.

c) cslb and cslh families
these two families are phylogenetically related as shown in figure  <dig>  cslb is a dicot-specific family while cslh is monocot-specific  <cit> . we have observed that the paralogous genes of these two families tend to form clusters and have similar gene structures  , suggesting the possibility of independent genome-specific duplications followed by subsequent sequence divergence.

discussion
the cellulose synthase-like gene families are among the most important players involved in the formation of plant cell walls. some csl families have been found to be responsible for the synthesis of the backbone of hemicelluloses, while the others are yet to be functionally characterized  <cit> . this study focuses on the computational identification and classification of the csl families in fully or nearly fully sequenced plant and algal genomes. our phylogenetic analyses have led to the identification of the csl orthologs across these genomes and the generation of new insights about how they might have evolved in plants and algae.

limitation in identifying cesas forming linear terminal complexes 
our analyses did not detect any cesa and csl genes in the three stramenopile algal genomes nor in the red algal genome, but this does not necessarily mean that no stramenopiles or red algae contain these families. in fact, a cesa gene has been identified very recently in an yet sequenced red alga porphyra yezoensis  <cit> . actually, the cellulose synthases, which assemble into the so-called terminal complex , have been found across all classes of organisms. tcs can be morphologically classified into rosette tcs or linear tcs  <cit> , for each of which the component cesas have rather different domain structures  <cit> . while the rosette tcs have been extensively studied and found in all seed plants, the linear tcs may be the most ancient, given their wider distribution across bacteria, fungi, animals and many classes of algae including stramenopiles  <cit> .

since the focus of this study is on cesas that form rosette tcs, we have adopted a rather conservative filtration procedure , which may have excluded some gt <dig> proteins that are possibly forming linear tcs. for instance, one gt <dig> gene from p. patens and seven gt <dig> genes from s. moellendorfii were removed by our filtration procedure  but have been found to be similar to the cesa genes of cyanobacteria and the red alga porphyra yezoensis  <cit> .

the green algal csla/c-like genes and their possible functions
despite all the previous studies about the distribution of cesas, very little has been done to identify the other csl families across different organisms. so what is known about these families is fragmented at the best. for example, a sequence fragment from chlamydomonas was reported to have diverged early from the csla and cslc families  <cit> . in our study, we found that all the six sampled chlorophyte green algae have a single-copy gene that is the most homologous to the land plant csla and cslc families. our phylogenetic analysis indicates that the csla and the cslc families might have evolved via a gene duplication event that occurred uniquely in land plants after they split from green algae .

cslas and cslcs have been characterized to encode mannan synthases  <cit>  and xyloglucan synthases  <cit> , respectively. it is tempting to speculate that the mannan synthesis might represent the ancestral function for the single-copy csla/c-like genes in green algae, since mannan is present in both charophyte algae and chlorophyte algae while xyloglucan is absent from these green algae  <cit> .

the divergence order of csl families
recent studies have shown that the plant cesa genes and some other csl families are likely of cyanobacterial origin  <cit> , possibly as a result of intracellular gene transfer from plastids . in a csl gene phylogeny built by nobles and brown, cslg was suggested to be the first csl family evolved in plants, followed by csle, cslb, cesa and csld  <cit> . however, our search of fully sequenced plant and algal genomes has shown that cslg is among the most narrowly distributed csl families, and is absent from our sampled algae and lower plants . intuitively, such a distribution pattern suggests that cslg might not be the earliest plant csl family.

when constructing the phylogeny of csl families , we included two cyanobacterial cesa protein sequences  as the out-group of the plant cesa and csl genes. these sequences are the only two hits  in our hmmsearch with the pfam cellulose_synt domain against all fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes . these two cyanobacterial sequences are phylogenetically more closely related to the land plant rosette-tc-forming cesas than to the other bacterial linear-tc-forming cesas  <cit> , and thus have been proposed as the progenitor of all the rosette-tc-forming cesas and csl genes. the rooted csl phylogeny  suggests a major early split between cesa/csld/f and the other csl families . clearly neither cslg nor any of the other csl families could be considered as the earliest in plants, because the cyanobacterial cesas are not placed closer to any particular plant csl family than to the others. instead, the csl phylogeny suggests that, after the establishment of plastids  in the ancestral plant, the cyanobacterial derived cesa gene might have undergone several rounds of sequence and function divergence . the evolutionary relationship of cslb/h to the other families is less clear from our phylogeny since the grouping of cslb/h with csle/g/j has only a modest support .

the finding that cslb/h/e/g/j split earlier than csld/f  is surprising, because csld is found in lower plants  whereas cslb/h/e/g/j are not. one plausible explanation is that some ancestral genes of the cslb/h/e/g/j families might have been present in the most recent common ancestor of the land plants, but were lost in moss and spike moss later. to test this hypothesis, we performed a tfasty  <cit>  search of the csl proteins against the p. patens genomic sequences and the s. moellendorffii genomic sequences , respectively, after masking out all predicted genes. interestingly we found that some short sequence fragments are more similar to cslb/e/g than to the other csl families, suggesting the possibility that they are the remnants of cslb/h/e/g/j. for example, the p. patens scaffold_ <dig> region from position  <dig> to position  <dig>  is 28% identical  to the poplar cslb protein eugene <dig>  from position  <dig> to position  <dig> , whose cellulose_synt pfam domain is from position  <dig> to position 747; and the s. moellendorffii scaffold_ <dig> region from position  <dig> to position  <dig> is 27% identical  to the rice csle protein os09g <dig>  from position  <dig> to position  <dig>  whose cellulose_synt pfam domain is from position  <dig> to position  <dig>  similar searches against green algal genomic dnas also found some homologous regions to the land plant cslb/h/e/g/j genes.

the seed plant-specific cslb/h/e/g/j families
although the common ancestor of the cslb/h/e/g/j families may have split from the other csl families during the early evolution of plants, their diversification might have occurred recently. this is supported by the narrow distribution of cslb and cslg in dicots and cslh in monocots. additionally, we have shown that all these five families have evolved rapidly . paralogous genes of these families typically form a monophyletic group in our phylogenies and have highly similar gene structures . these findings suggest that recent intragenomic duplications have played a major role in the rapid sequence and functional diversification of these families  <cit> . a simple tblastn  <cit>  search of the csl proteins against the masked plant genomic dna sequences  found many homologous dna fragments, indicating that they are likely pseudogenic relics after gene or genome duplications. a detailed analysis of these dna fragments could possibly lead to a deeper understanding about the evolution of these csl families.

CONCLUSIONS
the cellulose synthase superfamily is identified and phylogenetically analyzed in fully sequenced plant and algal genomes. we conclude that 1) a cslj family is present in both monocot and dicot plants, confirming two previous reports that it is a new csl family, and that 2) a green algae-specific csl family is most homologous to both land plant csla and cslc families and it is speculated to be a mannan synthase, and that 3) cslg may not be the first evolved csl family and a new model is proposed in regard to the evolution order of different csl families.
