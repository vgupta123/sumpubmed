BACKGROUND
experimentally evolved lineages of bacteria have provided important data on mechanisms involved in short-term bacterial evolution and adaptation  <cit>  in simple controlled environments. however, experiments in controlled environments cannot represent all forces contributing to evolution in non-controlled settings and natural environments. important differences between experimental and natural bacterial populations include  population sizes that are much greater in experimental populations than in a natural population;  generation times that are probably much shorter in an experimental population than in a natural population; and  absence of donors of genetic materials, which allow for rapid diversification via horizontal gene transfer . in addition, while experimental populations experience selective pressures that are usually low in number but high in intensity, natural populations encounter many selective pressures imposed by physical , chemical , and biological  variables, which differ in intensity and vary over time. the strong selective pressure provided by controlled environments often results in parallel evolution of replicates under the same conditions  <cit> . for example,  <dig> escherichia coli populations that originated from the same parent strain all showed substitutions in the same candidate genes after they were cultured for  <dig>  generations under identical conditions  <cit> .

listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive, facultative intracellular foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis in humans and many mammalian and avian species  <cit> . human listeriosis is a rare but severe disease; an estimated  <dig>  human invasive listeriosis cases including  <dig> deaths occur annually in the united states  <cit> . the vast majority of human listeriosis cases are caused by foodborne transmission  <cit> . a common source of food contamination appears to be transmission of l. monocytogenes present in processing plant environments to food products after they have been heat processed  <cit> . l. monocytogenes is ubiquitously distributed in the environment. it can grow under a wide range of environmental conditions, including temperatures ranging from  <dig> °c to 45°c  <cit>  and ph ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>   <cit> . consequently, it is difficult to control l. monocytogenes in food processing environments. although food processing facilities and equipment are regularly cleaned and sanitized, persistence of specific l. monocytogenes subtypes, over time periods ranging from a few months to more than five years, has been documented for a number of food processing facilities  <cit> .

it is also common for several l. monocytogenes subtypes to co-exist in the same food processing facility  <cit> . while use of molecular subtyping methods, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , has been critical in listeriosis outbreak investigations and surveillance, interpretation of subtyping data sometimes remains a challenge as isolates may diversify rapidly  and as epidemiologically unrelated strains may share identical pfge patterns  <cit> . consequently, there is a need to better understand l. monocytogenes diversification in non-controlled environments and to develop improved subtyping approaches that can be used in follow-up studies to routine subtyping using pfge.

in  <dig>  a sporadic case of human listeriosis in oklahoma, usa was linked to the consumption of l. monocytogenes contaminated turkey franks produced in a food processing facility in texas, usa  <cit> . twelve years later, in  <dig>  a multi-state listeriosis outbreak, which caused illnesses in  <dig> persons in  <dig> us states , was linked to consumption of deli turkey meat produced in the same processing facility that was linked to the  <dig> listeriosis case  <cit> . phenotypic and genotypic typing showed that human and food isolates from both episodes belonged to the same serotype , were slow rhamnose fermenters , and were indistinguishable by ribotyping  and pfge  <cit> . the pfge type for these isolates  was only found once among a set of  <dig> l. monocytogenes isolates previously characterized by pfge  <cit> , indicating that this specific strain represents a combination of genetic and phenotypic characteristics that is rare. while re-introduction of this strain in the processing plant from the outside environment represents a possibility, the rarity of this strain and the fact that ready-to-eat food processing plants typically implement practices to prevent introduction of microbial organisms suggests that persistence of a single l. monocytogenes strain in this facility for at least  <dig> years  <cit>  is the most likely explanation for the observations detailed above. the genome sequence of a food isolate  from the  <dig> episode has previously been determined using automated sanger sequencing  <cit> . we sequenced the genome of the corresponding human isolate from the  <dig> episode as well as the genomes of a human and a food isolate from the  <dig> outbreak. sequence comparisons of these genomes enabled us to characterize l. monocytogenes evolution during short-term survival in a non-controlled non-host environment and to determine the value of full genome sequencing as a subtyping approach in follow-up studies to outbreak investigations.

RESULTS
genome sequencing of three l. monocytogenes isolates by  <dig> pyrosequencing
the human isolate from the  <dig> listeriosis case  and a human  and a food  isolate from the  <dig> multi-state listeriosis outbreak in the us  were sequenced using the  <dig> gs <dig> genome sequencer , which uses the "sequencing by synthesis" technology  <cit> . chromosomal sequences ranged from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>   <dig> mb, the sequencing depth ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> -fold. the sequenced genomes captured between  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the egd-e reference genome .

the f <dig> genome sequence represents one pseudomolecule in which gaps between the contigs were closed with random sequences using the fully sequenced genome of egd-e as a reference  <cit> .

in addition to the chromosomal sequences, a plasmid sequence was found in the  <dig> human isolate . this plasmid represented two non-overlapping contigs of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp. these two plasmid contigs showed a very high level of nucleotide identity  with plm <dig>  an approx.  <dig> kb plasmid previously reported in the serotype 4b  strain h <dig>  <cit> . the two plasmid contigs included all  <dig> orfs previously identified in plm <dig>  <cit> . genes found in the plasmid contigs included at least  <dig> genes annotated as transposon genes in plm <dig> and two genes associated with cadmium resistance. the observation that this plasmid was only sequenced in the  <dig> human isolate  suggests either a loss of the plasmid in the other isolates  or an acquisition of this plasmid in the  <dig> human isolate.

genome alignment and polymorphism analyses
to identify genomic differences between the human and food isolate from the  <dig> case as well as a food and human isolate from the  <dig> outbreak, we aligned the  <dig> genomes using tba   <cit>  and refined this alignment using muscle  <cit> . the refined alignment of the four genomes had a total length of  <dig> , <dig> bp  . the aligned sequences for each genome ranged from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> . as between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genome sequences for each isolate could not be included in the alignment, it is possible that the four isolates contain some differences in addition to those detailed below. regions not included in the alignment most likely represent regions not sequenced in one or more genomes, deletions/insertions, or genome fragments replaced by a non-homologous sequence . specifically, while the length of the comk prophage sequence ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bases in the four isolates , the comk prophage alignment  was only  <dig>  bp, indicating extensive diversification including presence of non-homologous prophage sequences in the different isolates . this difference represents 25% of the non-aligned sequences in the whole genome alignment, although this prophage represents less than 2% of the genome size.

the final alignment was divided in three distinct non-overlapping alignments representing  the comk prophage ,  the trna thr- <dig> prophage , and  the backbone sequence  representing the rest of the chromosomal sequence. identification of polymorphisms and recombination were carried out separately for each alignment. the comk prophage alignment had  <dig>  polymorphic sites that differentiated the two  <dig> isolates from the two  <dig> isolates; at all of these sites, the isolates from the same year were identical to each other. in contrast, the trna thr- <dig> prophage alignment had one confirmed polymorphic site, which differentiated the  <dig> isolates from the  <dig> isolates; this site represents a nonsynonymous transversion . surprisingly, besides the polymorphisms found in the comk prophage, the polymorphism in the trna thr- <dig> prophage represents the only snp that differentiates the  <dig> isolates from the  <dig> isolates.

arrows indicate direction of genes in the chromosome, e.g.  <dig> →  <dig> means that the polymorphism falls downstream to lmof6854_ <dig> and upstream to lmof6854_ <dig>  ↔ means that the polymorphism falls upstream to both genes .

snp # <dig> is not present in fsl r2- <dig>  the j <dig> subculture sent from cdc to the cornell food safety laboratory , and is also not present in nine other human isolates linked to the  <dig> listeriosis outbreak, which were also tested; this snp thus appears to have arisen during laboratory passage of the j <dig> clone sequenced at the broad institute.

this nonsynonymous change falls within the phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate binding domain 

these nonsynonymous changes fall into regions that have no specific predicted domains

among the  <dig> confirmed polymorphisms in the backbone sequence  of the j <dig> subculture sequenced at broad, eight were specific to j <dig> , one was specific to f <dig> , and one was specific to j <dig>  . in addition, one polymorphism  was present in the j <dig> subculture sequenced at broad, but was not found in the j <dig> subculture used for re-sequencing at cornell . among the eight polymorphisms specific to the  <dig> food isolate , three fall in intergenic regions and five fall in coding sequences, including one representing a synonymous change and four representing nonsynonymous changes . the  <dig> human and food isolates thus differ from each other in four nonsynonymous sites, including one substitution  in addb, which encodes a protein that is part of the enzyme addab  <cit> . addab is analogous to e. coli recbcd, which is responsible for processing double-stranded breaks in the chromosome  <cit> .

distribution of the human outbreak isolate specific snps and plasmid sequences among other outbreak associated human clinical isolates
as the  <dig> human and food isolates differed by  <dig> snps, we identified additional human isolates associated with the  <dig> outbreak to validate these snps; unfortunately no additional food isolates associated with this outbreak were available for snp validation. nine isolates with ribotype dup-1053a  obtained between august and november of  <dig> from human clinical cases in ohio, michigan and new york were found to be slow rhamnose-fermenters. these isolates were also found, by pfge using apai and asci for restriction of dna, to be indistinguishable from each other and from the  <dig> and  <dig> human and food isolates sequenced. as these results strongly suggested that these nine isolates were from humans that were infected as part of the  <dig> outbreak, we screened these isolates for the  <dig> confirmed polymorphisms identified among the genome sequences for the human and food isolates from the  <dig> case and the  <dig> outbreak as well as for the presence of two plasmid-specific sequences. all  <dig> isolates were positive by pcr for both plasmid sequences, indicating that the plasmid found in j <dig> is present in most other human isolates associated with this outbreak. none of these nine human isolates had any of the polymorphisms specific to f <dig>  or j <dig> .

furthermore, none of the nine isolates shared the one snp specific to the subculture of the  <dig> human isolate  that was sequenced at broad , but that was not found in the j <dig> subculture that was used for re-sequencing at cornell, supporting the hypothesis that this polymorphism arose during laboratory passage of the j <dig> subculture sequenced at broad. nevertheless, all nine human isolates showed  nt sequences identical to j <dig>  at the eight sites that carry unique snps in the  <dig> food isolate ,  the snp unique to the  <dig> human isolate j <dig>  as well as  the trna thr- <dig> prophage snp  that differentiates the  <dig> isolates from the  <dig> isolates. snp  <dig> thus does not represent a random mutation unique to the sequenced human isolate from the  <dig> outbreak , but was found in all human clinical isolates surveyed from this outbreak.

intracellular growth assays of the  <dig> human and food isolates
while it is unlikely that any of the few nonsynonymous substitutions observed would affect the fitness of l. monocytogenes strains tested here, we performed preliminary experiments to test whether the nonsynonymous sites differentiating the  <dig> human and food isolates  could alter the function of the enzyme addab  <cit> , which is analogous to e. coli recbcd  <cit> . as recbcd deficient e. coli mutants have been shown to be more susceptible to oxidative dna damage  <cit> ; we hypothesized that the  <dig> food and human isolates may differ in their ability to survive inside activated macrophages  where they may be exposed to oxidative stress. we used fsl r2- <dig>  and the  <dig> food isolate j <dig> for these experiments. as no apparent difference in intracellular growth of these two strains was observed when the strains were initially characterized in separate intracellular growth assays , we performed triplicate competition experiments by infecting j <dig> cells with both strains simultaneously; competition assays like this typically provide for more sensitive means to identify whether one strain has a competitive advantage over another strain in a given environment  <cit> . in the competitive intracellular growth assay the relative recovery of both isolates after  <dig> h of intracellular growth did not differ significantly ; overall,  <dig> and  <dig> colonies, respectively, with the j <dig> and the j <dig> addb allelic type were recovered . while these data suggest that the mutations that differentiate the two  <dig> isolates do not affect the intracellular growth capabilities, of these isolates, in activated j <dig> macrophage cells, future phenotypic and animal experiments would be needed to further test whether the  <dig> human and food isolate genotypes differ in their fitness. as no data on the effect of an l. monocytogenes addb null mutation are available, it is unclear which physiological functions may be affected by nonsynonymous mutations in this gene. future experiments thus should involve characterization of an addb null mutant before conducting additional phenotypic and animal experiments to determine the effect of the observed nonsynonymous mutation in addb and/or other nonsynonymous mutations differentiating the  <dig> human and food isolates.

estimation of congruence between observed low mutation rate and known mutation rates in bacterial populations
overall, we only found a single synonymous nucleotide difference  between the  <dig> food isolate  and the  <dig> isolates and no synonymous nucleotide difference between the  <dig> human isolate  and the  <dig> isolates. in order to determine whether this low number of synonymous changes is consistent with previously reported mutation rates for bacteria, we calculated the estimated number of generations between the  <dig> isolates and the  <dig> food isolates  using previously reported mutation rates  <cit> , including  <dig>  –  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per bp per generation for experimental myxococcus xanthus populations  <cit>  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per bp per generation for experimental e. coli populations  <cit> . ochman et al.  <cit>  estimated a mutation rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per bp per year  for natural populations of e. coli and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per bp per year  for natural populations of buchnera. the number of generations was calculated as the /. using the two extremes of the suggested mutation rates  we estimated that between  <dig>  and  <dig>  generations separated the  <dig> isolates from the  <dig> isolates. assuming a  <dig> year time span between the two sets of isolates, these mutation rates translate into  <dig> and  <dig>  generations per year , yielding a generation time ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  hours. the generation time estimate  based on the low mutation rate  proposed for natural populations of e. coli  <cit>  is only about 2-fold longer than the estimated generation time for l. monocytogenes in rich media broth at 30°c   <cit> .

other l. monocytogenes generation times reported were  <dig>  h  and  <dig>  h . we thus propose that a mutation rate closer to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  is more likely to represent the mutation rate for l. monocytogenes, as a generation time of approx  <dig> –  <dig> h seems plausible for l. monocytogenes in natural environments. under this mutation rate, generation time, and assuming a poisson distribution, the probability of observing zero or one synonymous substitution is roughly the same , which is consistent with the observation that the  <dig> food isolate  differed from the  <dig> isolates by one synonymous change, while the  <dig> human isolate  showed no synonymous changes as compared to the  <dig> isolates. in conclusion, the low rate of mutations observed for the isolates studied here is thus clearly within the range expected based on previously reported mutation rates for other bacteria.

comparative analyses of comk prophage sequences in the  <dig> and  <dig> isolates
as the comk prophage in the  <dig> isolates showed considerable divergence from the comk prophage in the  <dig> isolates , further analyses were performed on the comk prophage sequences. initial blast searches against  the f <dig> genome,  genome sequences deposited in genbank  <cit> , and  genome sequences in the l. monocytogenes database at the broad institute  <cit>  found that the following prophages showed the highest similarity to the  <dig> isolate prophage sequence:  the comk prophage sequence in l. monocytogenes fsl j1- <dig> ,  the comk prophage in f <dig> ,  the phage a <dig>  ,  the comk prophage in egd-e   <cit> , and  the phage a <dig>   <cit> . additionally, blast searches of the individual genes in the comk prophage against these same databases, showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in the  <dig> isolates showed the best match with genes in the fsl j1- <dig> prophage ;  <dig> and  <dig> genes in the  <dig> isolates showed the best match with genes from the phage a <dig> and the egd-e comk prophage, respectively. while these data suggest that diversification of the comk prophage in the  <dig> isolates does not represent a prophage replacement with a sequenced prophage, replacement could have occurred with a prophage not represented in the available nucleotide sequence databases.

to determine whether recombination events could have contributed to the diversification of the comk prophage, recombination analyses were performed on an alignment of the four comk prophage sequences for the  <dig> and the  <dig> isolates and the prophage most closely related to the comk prophage in the  <dig> isolates . sawyer's test provided evidence for recombination among the five prophage sequences in the alignment  as well as for recombination with sequences not included in this alignment . overall, five inner recombination events involving the comk prophage in the two  <dig> isolates and fsl j1- <dig> were initially identified. visual analysis of the prophage sequences suggests at least three independent recombination events in the two  <dig> isolates, relative to the two  <dig> isolates; for these three recombinant regions  the prophage sequences in two  <dig> isolates were more similar to fsl j1- <dig> than to the prophage sequences in the two  <dig> isolates . analyses of nt identities between the  <dig> and  <dig> isolates and fsl j1- <dig> for all individual orfs in the comk prophage , also supported that extensive recombination occurred in this prophage. while  <dig> genes showed 100% identity between the  <dig> and  <dig> prophage genomes ,  <dig> other genes showed identities < 95% between the  <dig> and  <dig> prophage genomes and 100% identity between the  <dig> isolates and fsl j1- <dig> , suggesting introduction of these genes into the ancestor of the  <dig> isolates from a phage or prophage sequence closely related to that found in fsl j1- <dig>  eleven prophage genes in the two  <dig> isolates showed < 98% identity to the corresponding prophage sequence in the  <dig> isolates and a best match with a sequence other than that of fsl j1- <dig> , suggesting introduction from a distinct phage or prophage genotype.

for  <dig> genes present in the comk prophage of the  <dig> isolates , no homologues were identified in the genomes of the  <dig> isolates;  <dig> of these genes appear to have been replaced in the  <dig> isolates by non-homologous genes . these deletions and replacements in the  <dig> isolates are likely consequences of recombination events that integrated or replaced large sequences, as supported by the observation that some observed gene deletions or replacements were located in large recombinant fragments identified by sawyer's test. for example, the eight adjacent genes lmof6854_ <dig>  to lmof6854_ <dig>  found in the  <dig> isolates appear to have been replaced by a block of seven genes in the  <dig> isolates . two of these eight genes present in the  <dig> isolates  show no homology to the genes present in the  <dig> prophage .

discussion
determination of genome sequences for three l. monocytogenes isolates obtained from foods and human listeriosis cases linked to a single food processing facility, in conjunction with a previously reported genome sequence for a food isolate linked to the same facility  <cit> , provided a unique resource to gain insight into the short-term evolution of l. monocytogenes in non-controlled environments. overall, our data indicate that short term evolution of l. monocytogenes in natural non-controlled environments involves limited diversification of the genomic backbone, but can involve considerable phage-mediated diversification as well as plasmid loss or gain. in addition, our genome sequencing data support that a human listeriosis outbreak that occurred in  <dig> in the us was caused by a l. monocytogenes strain that is likely to have persisted in a food processing plant over at least  <dig> years, supporting the utility of genome sequencing for high resolution follow-up studies in disease outbreak investigations.

short term evolution of l. monocytogenes in natural environments can involve considerable phage mediated diversification and loss or gain of plasmids
while a few singletons  were observed in the genome backbone of the two  <dig> and the two  <dig> isolates, the only polymorphisms that differentiate the  <dig> isolates from the  <dig> isolates fall within the two prophages inserted into comk and trna-thr- <dig>  while the trna-thr- <dig> prophage region showed only one snp that differentiated the  <dig> and  <dig> isolates, the comk prophage region differs considerably between the two  <dig> and the two  <dig> isolates. our data suggest that multiple recombination events lead to diversification of the comk prophage, although the occurrence of a single prophage replacement event cannot be excluded. recombination events seem to have replaced a number of phage genes  with allelic variants or non-homologous genes. for example the gene encoding the major capsid in the  <dig> isolates  was replaced with a non-homologous major capsid gene  in the  <dig> isolates. mechanistically, the observed recombination events in the comk prophage most likely occurred through infection with one or more phages in one or more cells of the  <dig> genotype, followed by subsequent recombination or phage replacement. in addition to diversification of the integrated prophage genomes observed here, it has been well documented that phages can be vectors for horizontal transfer of genes located in the genome backbone  <cit>  and that phages are capable of generalized transduction in l. monocytogenes  <cit> . while we did not find any evidence for horizontal gene transfer outside the prophage region in the isolates studied here, horizontal gene transfer in genes in the backbone genome has been well documented in l. monocytogenes  <cit> . while very little is known about the frequency of phage insertion and phage transduction in bacteria in natural environments, hodgson  <cit>  reported that rates of phage transduction of listeria under laboratory conditions ranged from about  <dig> to  <dig> transductants per  <dig> pfu. in conclusion, while short term evolution of l. monocytogenes in natural environments involves limited diversification of the genomic backbone, phage-mediated genetic changes appear to be major mechanisms for diversification and evolution of l. monocytogenes during short evolutionary time frames. this is particularly interesting as there is no evidence for phage-encoded virulence genes in listeria, unlike for a number of other pathogens where phage mediated transfer and diversification of virulence genes appear to represent an important mechanism for diversification.

our data are consistent with the overall idea that bacteriophages play multiple important roles in the evolution of bacterial populations in natural environments, including  providing selective pressure on bacterial populations  and  providing a mechanism for rapid horizontal exchange of genetic material . contributions of bacteriophages to genetic diversification also have been well characterized in different pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species. for example, the v. cholerae ctx genetic element represents the genome of a lysogenic bacteriophage, which carries the genes for cholera toxin  <cit> . this lysogenic phage can be induced in toxigenic strains and the resulting phage particle appears to be able to transduce non-toxigenic v. cholerae  <cit> . similarly, in different e. coli pathotypes, shiga-toxin genes as well as genes encoding other virulence factors are located on different prophages  <cit> . diversification of prophages integrated in the chromosome of bacteria also appears to occur rapidly and commonly and contributes to bacterial genome evolution. for example, in enterohemorrhagic e. coli considerable diversification of prophages carrying virulence determinants has been observed, likely indicating independent infections of host bacteria by different bacteriophages carrying these virulence determinants  <cit> . similarly, considerable diversity has been observed in the genome of the vibrio ctx prophage . the importance of bacteriophages and lysogenic prophages in the evolution of gram-positive pathogens has also been documented . for example, the rapid emergence of serotype m <dig> group a streptococcus  has been associated with the acquisition of a prophage that contained a unique combination of virulence genes, which was probably generated through several recombination events  <cit> . moreover, most of the genetic diversity among gas strains seems to be phage-related  <cit> . prophages and diversification of prophage-associated genes thus appears to play an important role in the evolution of various bacterial species.

in addition to the diversification in the comk prophage, we also found that the four isolates differed in their plasmid content; a plasmid sequence was only found in the  <dig> human isolate, as well as in nine additional human isolates linked to this outbreak. while our findings suggest that plasmid loss or acquisition events occurred, it can not be determined whether these changes occurred during l. monocytogenes survival in the processing plant, during passage of isolates, or during human infection. rapid diversification of l. monocytogenes due to plasmid loss or acquisition has previously been reported and isolates from the same outbreak have been shown to differ in their plasmid profiles  <cit> . however, it is important to note that the media commonly used to isolate l. monocytogenes  contain acriflavine, a plasmid curing agent  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the isolates for which no plasmid sequence was obtained lost this plasmid during isolation or during laboratory passage.

genome sequence data support that a human listeriosis outbreak in  <dig> was caused by a l. monocytogenes strain that persisted in a food processing plant
our data showed that the human and food isolates from a sporadic case in  <dig> and the human and food isolates from an outbreak in  <dig>  which were linked to the same food processing facility, had genome sequences that showed no major inversions, deletions and insertions, although minor changes like these cannot be ruled out since the genome sequences have not been fully finished and assembled. while the four isolates showed a total of  <dig> confirmed snps, all  <dig> snps that occurred in the genome backbone represented singletons, i.e., they were found in only one of the four isolates. the only mutations that differentiated the  <dig> isolates from the  <dig> isolates were  one single snp in the trna-thr-4-prophage and  a large number of snps and deletions in the comk prophage, which most likely represent multiple recombination events. this high level of overall genome conservation between the human and food isolates from the  <dig> listeriosis case and the  <dig> outbreak strongly supports that these two incidences were caused by the same l. monocytogenes strain, which is likely to have persisted over at least  <dig> years in the processing plant that produced the food linked to both the  <dig> case and the  <dig> outbreak. persistence is also supported by the observation that the pfge type represented by the persistent strain seems rare . re-introduction from the immediate environment surrounding the plant is a possible, but unlikely, alternative to persistence of the specific strain in the processing plant, particularly as ready-to-eat meat processing plants will have controls in place to minimize introduction of microorganisms. persistence in turkey flocks providing raw materials for this plant is even less likely as the heat treatment used for production of frankfurters and deli meats inactivates l. monocytogenes  <cit> . similarly, re-introduction through a persistently infected worker is highly unlikely as people rarely shed l. monocytogenes  <cit> . importantly, even in the unlikely scenario that the unique strain linked to listeriosis cases in  <dig> and  <dig> was reintroduced, rather than having persisted in the plant, the isolates characterized here would still represent a set of closely related isolates with a parent-descendant relationship, which have multiplied in a non-controlled environment over about  <dig> years. thus, the alternative scenarios outlined above do not affect the main conclusions of our study, including that phage mediated mechanisms are critical for short term diversification of l. monocytogenes.

overall, our data demonstrate the utility of using full genome sequencing for follow-up investigations to epidemiological and source tracking studies. in particular, full genome sequencing clearly allowed for differentiation of the l. monocytogenes isolates from the  <dig> case and the isolates associated with the  <dig> outbreak, even though these isolates were previously found to be identical by other subtyping methods, including pfge  <cit> . genome sequencing not only represents the most sensitive subtyping approach conceivable, but also provides for specific identification of differences between isolates, which can be used to assess whether differences between two isolates are likely to have occurred within a short time frame or not. this assessment is critical for source tracking as genomic diversification that can lead to different genomic restriction profiles can clearly occur over short time periods . rapid diversification in certain hot spots  represents a challenge as the current gold standard method for bacterial subtyping is a genomic restriction profiling approach , which means that closely related isolates may have different pfge types . importantly though, the standard restriction enzymes used for l. monocytogenes pfge analyses  only interrogate < <dig> nt for snps; based on the genome sequence for f <dig>  there are  <dig> restriction sites for apai, which recognizes a  <dig> bp motif , and  <dig> restriction sites for asci, which recognizes a  <dig> bp motif . thus, genetically distinct isolates may share the same pfge pattern. for example, nightingale et al.  <cit>  found that l. monocytogenes isolates with the same pfge pattern may differ by presence/absence of premature stop codons in a number of genes, including the virulence gene inlb. in contrast to pfge, our sequence analyses used > <dig>  mb of aligned sequences for subtype discrimination, thus providing for vastly improved detection of substitutions. while we cannot exclude that the isolates characterized show differences in their genomes in addition to those reported here , this approach clearly provides for a comprehensive sampling of the genomic diversity in the characterized isolates. future use of full genome sequencing for epidemiological investigations of bacterial infectious disease outbreaks thus seems feasible assuming anticipated continued decreases in the cost of dna sequencing  <cit>  and availability of computational tools that allow for rapid and reliable genome assembly and comparisons.

isolate specific snp patterns in the genomic backbone may occur during environmental growth, isolation or subculture
analysis of the single nucleotide polymorphism in the genome backbone of the isolates from both the  <dig> listeriosis case and the  <dig> listeriosis outbreak also provided us with the ability to probe the evolution of l. monocytogenes isolates during environmental persistence and during human infection. based on our data, we hypothesize that the ancestor of f <dig> and f <dig>  contaminated the plant in or before  <dig>  the single snp differentiating the  <dig> human isolate from the  <dig> food isolate is consistent with a very close ancestral relationship between these two isolates; the unique snp in the human isolate could have occurred in the ancestor of the human isolate  during multiplication in either the plant, the contaminated food, or the infected human or during isolation and propagation of the isolate. the ancestor of f <dig> remained in the plant and persisted until  <dig>  between  <dig> and  <dig>  the comk prophage of that strain was replaced  by the prophage found in the  <dig> isolates. moreover, one mutation that differentiates the  <dig> isolates from the  <dig> isolates occurred in the trna prophage . after the comk prophage replacement and the trna mutation, one mutation in j <dig>  and eight mutations in j <dig>  occurred and differentiated these two isolates from each other and from the  <dig> isolates. the substitution that is unique to the  <dig> human isolate must have occurred during growth prior to infection and isolation as it was found in the sequenced human isolate  as well as in an additional  <dig> human isolates . on the other hand, the substitutions in the  <dig> food isolate could have occurred during multiplication in the plant, the contaminated food, or during isolation and laboratory propagation. the observation that the  <dig> food isolate carries eight unique snps, which clearly separated this isolate from the other three isolates, while carrying a comk prophage region identical to the  <dig> human isolate, suggests that these mutations occurred after the two  <dig> isolates diverged from the  <dig> strain. the possibility that these snps arose during laboratory passages is supported by our observation that two subcultures of the  <dig> human isolates differed by one snp as well as observations that two subcultures of bacillus anthracis strain porton differed by a number of snps  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
analyses of full genome data of four l. monocytogenes isolates associated with a sporadic human listeriosis case  and a subsequent outbreak , both linked to the same food processing facility, not only demonstrated the utility of full genome sequencing for detailed follow-up studies that can provide an improved understanding of infectious disease transmission, but also represent one of the few datasets that provide insights at the full genome level into evolutionary patterns of bacteria in non-controlled environments. the limited number of mutations observed in the genome backbone are consistent with mutation rates in bacteria previously calculated using data from both experimental  and natural populations  <cit> . rather than single base-pair mutations or rearrangements in the genomic backbone, diversification in prophage sequences, and possibly plasmid loss and acquisition , seem to represent the major drivers of diversification in l. monocytogenes in non-controlled environments. interestingly, in l. monocytogenes, diversification by these mechanisms seems to not target virulence genes as neither plasmid nor phage-based l. monocytogenes virulence genes have been identified so far. the clearly observed pattern of considerable phage-mediated diversification in highly related l. monocytogenes isolates with nearly identical genome backbone sequences also demonstrates that the absence of any possibility for phage-mediated diversification during in vitro evolution studies of bacteria represents a major constraint associated with these studies. this report is one of the first studies on the short-term genome evolution of bacteria in a non-controlled environment, thus providing important information that may help in interpretation of data from laboratory evolution experiments. despite the fact that studies on naturally evolving populations in non-controlled environments will necessarily include a number of drawbacks , these studies are a critical complement to laboratory-based studies and are needed to improve our understanding of the evolution of bacteria in natural environments.
