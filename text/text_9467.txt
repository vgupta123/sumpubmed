BACKGROUND
agarwood is resinous heartwood derived from aquilaria and gyrinops trees. due to the high economic value of these trees and the extensive deforestation, agarwood producing tree species have become endangered. the use of agarwood is prevalent in many cultures for religious ceremonies, perfumes, and especially in chinese herbal medicine, where plant materials are commonly utilized  <cit> . agarwood is one of the most used plant materials in chinese medicine, second only to ginseng. the value of agarwood lies not only in its aromatic compounds  <cit> , but also in its non-volatile compounds, which potentially have beneficial properties with regards to human medicine  <cit> .

in our previous study, we presented a draft genome and a putative pathway for cucurbitacins e and i, compounds with known medicinal value, in aquilaria agallocha  <cit> , one of the largest producers of agarwood. briefly, gene expression changes for in vitro samples treated with methyl jasmonate  were shown to be consistent with known responses of a. agallocha to biotic stress and a set of homologous genes related to cucurbitacin biosynthesis in arabidopsis thaliana was identified. however, mj treatment is perhaps not the most efficient protocol. although there exists much research into chinese medicinal herbs and extraction of high value compounds, few have focused on increasing the quantity of target compounds through stimulation of its related pathways in this species.

in this study, we demonstrate that the quantity of cucurbitacins can be controlled by utilizing different types of light. red light  and far-red light  are components of the solar spectrum that strongly affect plant tissues. many studies have reported an interaction between plant defenses and r/fr responses  <cit> . under low r/fr conditions, there is a dramatic decrease not only in the number of root nodules but also in the expression of jasmonic acid  response genes. in a study on phytochrome b  mutants, ja-related gene expression levels have also been observed to be down-regulated  <cit>  and are known to participate in secondary metabolic pathways  <cit> .

in order to better understand the effect of light conditions on cucurbitacin secondary metabolic pathways in a. agallocha, we performed high-throughput sequencing experiments under two different light conditions: red light, a factor activating phyb, and far-red light, a factor inhibiting phyb  <cit> . three types of sequencing experiments were performed: rna sequencing  to study gene expression, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to study dna methylation, and small rna  sequencing to determine srnas that play a role in methylation. as epigenetic modifications may also play a role in the regulation of gene expression, studies on dna methylation are becoming increasing important.

to higher organisms, dna methylation plays an important and widespread role in epigenetic modification, mediated by dna methyltransferases . dna methylation in the genome is known to provide protection from transposons and/or rna viruses, where they play a role in regulating splicing. dna methylation is also associated with major developmental reprogramming  <cit> . small rnas are also an essential factor in plants where they play a role in regulating the activation of functional genes and transposons  <cit> .

the results of our analysis show that r/fr conditions have a large effect on gene expression levels in agarwood. rna-seq data revealed an array of gene clusters with distinctive expression patterns, where individual gene clusters responded primarily to red light or far-red light. differentially methylated regions  discovered from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data showed that there is also a large difference in methylation levels between r/fr conditions. we observed that srnas may potentially play a role in influencing the methylation levels of genes important to secondary metabolism and subsequently play a role in gene expression regulation.

these genome wide profiles provide insight into the regulatory interaction between red light and far-red light conditions in a. agallocha as well as identify compelling new candidates for secondary metabolic functional components. the data used in this study is freely available at our provided webserver  and at ncbi .

RESULTS
red light conditions increase cucurbitacin e and i content
in our previous study, we showed that agarwood contained high cucurbitacin content and that mj treatment increased content levels  <cit> . here, we instead used red light conditions to stimulate cucurbitacin biosynthesis . from lc-esi-ms quantification, it was seen that cucurbitacin content increased as red light exposure increased, up to 356 μg/g of cucurbitacin i at day  <dig>  cucurbitacin i content decreased as far-red light exposure increased, down to 96 μg/g at day  <dig>  similarly for cucurbitacin e, content levels increased up to 972 μg/g under red light conditions at day  <dig> and decreased down to 567 μg/g under far-red light conditions at day  <dig>  under red light conditions, at peak levels, cucurbitacin content was significantly increased compared to normal light conditions with p-values of  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> for cucurbitacin i and e respectively in a two-sample t-test. similarly for far-red light conditions, at the lowest levels, cucurbitacin content was significantly decreased compared to normal light conditions with p-values of  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> for cucurbitacin i and e respectively.fig.  <dig> endogenous cucurbitacin content of in vitro agarwood. content was measured after red and far-red light treatment over the course of 5 days. data is represented as mean ± standard deviation . at peak levels under red light conditions, cucurbitacin content was significantly increased compared to normal light conditions . at the lowest levels under far-red light conditions, cucurbitacin content was significantly decreased compared to normal light conditions 



different types of light affect various biological pathways in plants. there are five classes of phytochromes which typically absorb red light and far-red light  <cit> . previous studies on phya and phyb photosensory functions show that red light activated phyb interacts with transcription factors to induce a phytochrome-dependent signaling cascade  <cit>  and that vascular plant one-zinc-finger  transcription factors interact with phyb  <cit> . vozs are active transcription factors that promote sa and ja-mediated defense responses under biotic stress  <cit> . far-red light is known to inhibit phyb and plays an antagonistic role in most pathways  <cit> .

previous studies have demonstrated that target compounds can be increased through stimulating biosynthetic pathways  <cit>  and that light can be used as stimuli for increasing compound yield  <cit> . with the increasing commonality of plant factories, the use of light as stimuli instead of chemical treatment may be preferable due to a simpler protocol.

red light and far-red light gene expression patterns in agarwood
in order to study the effects of different light on gene expression in agarwood, we performed high-throughput rna sequencing under red light and far-red light conditions. the time-course rna-seq data  was obtained from samples under red light and far-red light conditions at  <dig>   <dig>  and 5 days, as well as normal conditions . two biological replicates were sequenced.table  <dig> rna-seq libraries under different light conditions



we utilized the rna-seq data and the previously constructed a. agallocha genome  <cit>  for gene expression quantification, resulting in an average correlation coefficient of  <dig>  for gene expression levels between biological replicates. genes were clustered into  <dig> clusters based on their expression patterns, requiring a two-fold change in expression and a p-value cut-off of  <dig>  for differential expression . in total,  <dig> genes were determined to be differentially expressed and clustered into distinct expression patterns . gene ontology  classification was performed to identify each cluster’s most significant biological process .fig.  <dig> cluster analysis of gene expression patterns in agarwood. sixteen clusters were identified by k-means clustering. the samples are represented on the x-axis, from left to right: fr day  <dig>  fr day  <dig>  fr day  <dig>  normal, r day  <dig>  r day  <dig>  r day  <dig>  the centered log <dig> fold-change is represented on the y-axis



clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were observed to exhibit a pattern of up-regulation under red light conditions and repression under far-red light conditions, consistent with the observed changes in cucurbitacin content levels. the go classifications show that  <dig> out of  <dig> genes, in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> combined, are classified as belonging to metabolic processes . furthermore, these clusters contain  <dig> genes classified as belonging to terpene biosynthesis, the main class of compounds related to the medicinal properties of agarwood . terpenoid content is induced under biotic stress as an immune response to resist various pathogens  <cit>  and its derivatives have been shown to exhibit anti-microorganism, anti-tumour, and other pharmacological effects that are beneficial towards human medicine  <cit> . in addition to terpene biosynthesis, clusters  <dig> and  <dig> contained  <dig> genes related to defense response. previous studies have shown that far-red light down-regulates the expression of defense response genes by reducing a plant’s sensitivity to jasmonate  in arabidopsis  <cit> . from the rna-seq data, it was seen that some defense response genes were up-regulated under red light conditions and down-regulated under far-red light conditions. these results are consistent with our expectations and suggest that controlled light conditions can be used in place of plant hormones to induce defense response genes in agarwood.

red light and far-red light dna methylation patterns in agarwood
in order to study the effect of different light on methylation patterns in agarwood, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing with two biological replicates for red light day  <dig>  far-red light day  <dig>  and normal samples . the methylation levels for each sample were used to discover differentially methylated regions  between different light conditions. a characterization of dmrs  shows that dmr proportions in transposons and intergenic regions were not significantly changed by r or fr conditions. in genic regions, it was seen that there was a slight increase  in dmr proportions at promoter regions under fr conditions. the number of dmrs for each light condition  indicates that there is a large change in methylation levels between red light and far-red light conditions.fig.  <dig> characterization of differentially methylated regions for light conditions red light, far-red light, and normal. a composition of dmrs in the a. agallocha genome. te represents transposable elements, ig represents intergenic regions, gene represents the gene body, and promoter represents gene promoter regions. b number of dmrs that are overlapping or unique to red light and far-red light conditions



we focused on hypo-dmrs under red light conditions, using the consensus hypo-dmrs between r/normal and r/fr data, resulting in  <dig> regions for analysis. the average methylation levels in red light hypo-dmrs  show that chh methylation  exhibit the most significant differences under red light conditions. this remains the trend for average weighted methylation levels  <cit>  in genic regions , where the most significant differences in methylation levels were observed in promoter regions for chh methylation. chg methylation levels were also observed to be affected by red light while cg methylation levels were relatively unchanged. these results suggest that red light may regulate gene expression in agarwood by changing chh and chg methylation, primarily in promoter regions.fig.  <dig> methylation levels for hypo-dmrs under red light conditions. a box plots displaying the distribution of average cg, chg, and chh methylation levels for hypo-dmrs under red light conditions. b average methylation levels in gene bodies and flanking 2 kb regions. each gene was aligned from start to end and divided into  <dig> equal bins. upstream and downstream flanking regions were also each divided into  <dig> equal bins. weighted methylation levels were calculated for each of the  <dig> bins across all corresponding regions



in higher plants, domains rearranged methylase  <dig>  catalyzes de novo dna methylation in all cytosine contexts including cg, chg, and chh  <cit> , via the rna-directed dna methylation pathway  . cytosine methylation and demethylation are both closely linked with gene regulation where high methylation patterns typically accompany low gene expression  <cit> . in rddm, argonaute  <dig>  has been recognized to interact with srnas and participate in dna methylation .

srnaome of red light and far-red light conditions in agarwood
in order to identify srnas that play a role in changes to methylation under different light conditions, we performed srna sequencing with two biological replicates for red light day  <dig>  far-red light day  <dig>  and normal samples . overall, approximately  <dig> million distinct srnas were able to be mapped perfectly and uniquely to the genome. a characterization of mapped srnas  revealed that the majority  of srnas were mapped to genic regions, within which, a large majority  were mapped to promoter regions. as well, we characterized the mapped srnas in terms of their length  and observed that  <dig>  % of the srnas were 24-nt long overall,  <dig>  % in promoter regions. these results support the idea that under different light conditions, srna may play a role in dna methylation via ago <dig> and the rddm pathway in agarwood.table  <dig> characterization of srnas by sequence length



small rnas are classified into two major categories: microrna  and short interfering rna   <cit> . small rnas, which are cut from double-stranded rna  by dicer-like enzymes, participate in gene silencing as mirna . the focus of this study, sirnas, are processed from the overlapping regions of natural sense-antisense transcript pairs or the near-perfect double-stranded rnas  synthesized by rna-dependent rna polymerases  . based on their origins, plant sirnas include four major classes: heterochromatic sirnas , trans-acting sirnas , natural antisense transcript-derived sirnas , and long sirnas   <cit> . sirnas bind to specific argonaute proteins to form a rna-induced silencing complex  guiding riscs to dna or rna targets based on sequence complementarity and trigger gene silencing transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally  <cit> . different agos have different preferences. ago <dig> has a strong bias towards 5’ terminal uridine, ago <dig> prefers 5’ terminal adenosine, and ago <dig> prefers 5’ terminal adenosine, guanine, or uridine  <cit> . different length small rnas play different roles and are cut by different dicer-like enzymes   <cit> . among them, the 24-nt long mirnas  and 24-nt sirnas are processed by dcl <dig>  <cit> . these 24-nt small rnas interact with ago <dig> and acts as a guide to catalyze dna methylation via rddm  <cit> .

regulation of secondary metabolic gene expression by rddm pathway
although dna methylation in promoter regions and intergenic transposable elements generally inhibit gene expression  <cit> , the role of dna methylation in a. agallocha is still unclear. to further our understanding of dna methylation in a. agallocha, we identified srnas that inhibit gene expression through the rddm pathway selected from the set of metabolic processes genes containing hypo-methylated regions .

as mentioned previously, different agos have different preferences. here, we focused on srna sequences that suited ago <dig> preferences and mapped to hypo-dmrs. we identified  <dig> genes in agarwood related to secondary metabolism that fit our criteria. three candidate genes were selected for further analysis , a sterol methytransferase , a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase , and a cytochrome p <dig> . the selected genes show that srnas were mapped to red light hypo-dmrs with a corresponding increase in mrna expression under red light conditions. the expression levels were also verified using qrt-pcr .fig.  <dig> light conditions regulate gene expression by the rddm pathway. the rna expression, dna methylation, and srna expression is shown for three candidate genes: g <dig> , g <dig> , and g <dig> . signals in red represent red light conditions while signals in blue represent far-red light conditions



in the three candidate genes, we detected three specific srnas that mapped perfectly to promoter regions under far-red light conditions. it was seen that these srnas had a positive relationship with dna methylation levels and a negative relationship with gene expression levels. in contrast, for both the srna sequencing and qrt-pcr validation, these srnas were not able to be detected under red light conditions. this suggests that the effects of red light and far-red light on secondary metabolism gene expression in agarwood are antagonistic to each other and that these srnas potentially play a role in gene expression regulation through the rddm pathway in cucurbitacin biosynthesis.

sterols  belong to steroids and are ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms, playing pivotal roles in membrane structure and as precursors of vitamins and steroid hormones  <cit> . sterol methyltransferases are known to catalyze a single methyl addition, an important step in phytosterol synthesis  <cit> , and important to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as cucurbitacin. hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases belong to alcohol oxidoreductases, which catalyzes the dehydrogenation of hydroxysteroid in steroidgenesis by cofactor nadp or nad and may affect the activity of compounds  <cit> . cytochrome p450s  are also ubiquitous in many organisms. in plants, one or more cyp450s participate in compound modification and affect compound activity in secondary metabolism  <cit> . as well, some cyp450s play an important role in steroidgenesis  <cit> .

although these three candidate genes belong to rather large gene families, the gene expression, srna, and methylation patterns under red light and far-red light conditions indicate that these genes are potentially important for cucurbitacin metabolism in agarwood.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we performed three types of sequencing experiments in order to study the effect of light conditions on cucurbitacin biosynthesis and secondary metabolism in agarwood. this resulted in a number of new insights regarding the global regulation of genes by red light and far-red light. from the rna sequencing results, gene expression patterns were clustered into distinct clusters, many of which can be characterized as responding primarily to light conditions. in particular, two gene expression clusters clearly exhibited gene expression patterns in response to red light and far-red light. significantly, the two clusters included genes related to terpene biosynthesis and defense response. in addition to gene expression, small rna and dna methylation were observed to be factors affected by different light conditions which in turn affect cucurbitacin metabolism in agarwood. we identified a set of small rna which potentially regulates gene expression through the rddm pathway.

the results from this study provide genome-wide profiles of rna expression, small rna, and dna methylation with regards to light conditions. these profiles provide insight into the effect of light on gene expression for cucurbitacin biosynthesis in agarwood as well as provide compelling new candidates for functional secondary metabolic components, highlighting new questions to be addressed in future studies.

we also demonstrate that light conditions can be used in lieu of methyl jasmonate treatment to stimulate pathways related to secondary metabolism, increasing the yield of cucurbitacins. this has important implications for the increasing use of plant factories for the synthesis of high value compounds.
