BACKGROUND
stk33/stk <dig> is a serine/threonine kinase discovered in the course of sequencing the human chromosome  <dig> region 11p <dig> and mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the stk <dig> gene in the mouse  is expressed differentially in a number of specific tissues and cells like testes, lung epithelia, alveolar macrophages, and horizontal cells in the retina. in mouse embryos stk <dig> expression is found in the developing heart, brain and spinal cord  <cit> . based on sequence comparison with other kinases the stk33/stk <dig> protein was classified as a member of the ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase family   <cit> .

the camk group is a family of multifunctional kinases: camk i, camk ii and camk iv. among the most well characterized camks is ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii. camk ii can phosphorylate a wide range of substrates and regulates numerous cellular functions including cell division, differentiation, cardiac contraction, and synaptic plasticity  <cit> . camk ii is abundantly expressed in the brain  <cit>  and a major effector for calcium-dependent signaling in neurons. the important neuronal function of camk ii α has been demonstrated by analysing mice with certain mutated forms of camk ii α  <cit> . in comparison with camk ii α little is known about the camk ii β subunit despite its prevailing appearance in the central nervous system. alternative splicing variants of camk ii β in brain with different kinase activity were identified  <cit> . in contrast to α and β isoforms predominantly expressed in neural tissues, the δ isoforms of camk ii prevail in the heart  <cit> . the camk ii γ isoform is mainly expressed in differentiated smooth muscle cells . a novel variant of the γ isoform, camk ii γ g- <dig>  can be found in several smooth muscles, in heart and brain, but not in skeletal muscle and liver  <cit> . in unstimulated dsmcs it colocalizes with vimentin. activation with a depolarizing stimulus leads to autophosphorylation of camk ii and phosphorylation of vimentin at camk ii specific sites. as a consequence camk ii bound to cytoskeletal vimentin is now translocated into the cytosol. this targeting is essential for signaling in differentiated smooth muscle cells because prevention of camk ii targeting by antisense knockdown of camk ii γ g- <dig> leads to inhibition of erk  activation as well as to inhibition of muscle contraction  <cit> . anchoring camk ii γ g- <dig> to vimentin in unstimulated cells is discussed as a prerequisite for optimal kinase activation or for spatial separation of the kinase and its substrate  <cit> .

serine  <dig> and serine  <dig> of vimentin are the major in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation sites by camk ii  <cit> . in cells infected with the cytoplasmatic dna virus asfv  viral dna replication resulted in activation of camk ii and phosphorylation of vimentin on serine  <dig> by camk ii. incubation of cells with an inhibitor of camk ii, kn <dig>  prevented phosphorylation of vimentin and blocked both viral dna replication and late gene expression. this underlines that camk activation is required for late asfv gene expression, but the precise role played by camk ii in asfv dna replication is still unknown. in virus infected cells vimentin phosphorylated on serine  <dig> disassembles into aggregates which are transported along microtubules and are reorganized into a cage like structure around virus assembly site. this vimentin cage has on the one hand a cytoprotective function by preventing the diffusion of viral components into cytoplasm and on the other hand it concentrates late structural proteins at site of virus assembly  <cit> .

the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state regulates the dynamic behaviour of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. the major vimentin phosphatase in vivo is type  <dig> protein phosphatase   <cit> . pp1c is in vivo associated with vimentin and dephosphorylates the camk ii-specific phosphorylation sites of vimentin ser <dig> and ser <dig>  phospho-ser <dig> of vimentin is dephosphorylated much slower than phospho-ser <dig> by pp1c  <cit> . this delayed ser <dig> dephosphorylation might influence the dynamics of vimentin filament assembly/disassembly. a requirement for cell division during mitosis is the reorganization of the intermediate filament system through phosphorylation of vimentin as demonstrated by site-specific mutation of vimentin  <cit> . in the case of polo-like kinase  <dig> , a kinase which also phosphorylates vimentin ser <dig>  <cit> , elevated ser <dig> phosphorylation by plk <dig> may play a role in efficient segregation of vimentin filaments during mitosis  <cit>  as phospho-ser <dig> on vimentin is hardly dephosphorylated by pp <dig> in mitosis. phospho-ser <dig> may act as a memory phosphorylation site  <cit> .

the different sites available for serine/threonine phosphorylation in vimentin are targeted by different kinases  <cit> . since we found the striking colocalization of vimentin and stk <dig> in various cell types and tissues , we were prompted to investigate whether stk <dig> might be another kinase to phosphorylate vimentin.

stk <dig> is a serine/threonine kinase of so far unknown function. in the present study we used bacterially expressed recombinant mouse stk <dig> with several artificial vimentin deletion mutant polypeptides also expressed as recombinant proteins in e. coli for in vitro phosphorylation assays. in addition we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with protein extracts obtained from the mouse sertoli cell culture serw <dig>  we know from previous studies  that stk <dig> and vimentin are coexpressed and colocalized in sertoli cells of mouse testes. so, sertoli cells should be an ideal resource for gaining native interacting stk <dig> and vimentin.

however, from our previous studies it is also clear, that stk <dig> is not always expressed in cells together with vimentin. we find stk <dig> in vimentin-negative cells, too.

the differential expression pattern of stk <dig> in mice and men resembles those of some members of the camk-group  <cit> . stk <dig> and camkii might have similar functions for example in the dynamic regulation of the intermediate filament system by phosphorylation in the course of the separation of daughter cells during mitosis. stk <dig> is expressed very specifically in some organs of the developing mouse embryo  <cit> . thus, stk <dig> could play also a role in organ development in addition to its function in phosphorylating vimentin. in this study, however we show that vimentin is a target for phosphorylation by stk <dig> in vitro and that stk <dig> and vimentin can be co-immunoprecipitated indicating a close interaction also in vivo.

RESULTS
kinase assay
the recombinant stk <dig> enzyme was expressed in e. coli and affinity purified  <cit> . it contains all canonical kinase subdomains and signatures  <cit>  and also the epitope for the anti-stk <dig> antibody used in this study, which is located n-terminal to the kinase domain . in addition to nearly full length enzyme, a naturally occurring splice variant of stk <dig>  stk33δ was also tested in the assay. this splice variant was cloned and expressed as described for recombinant nearly full length stk <dig>  <cit>  . in this splice variant, there are  <dig> base pairs within the kinase domain missing. parts of the missing amino acid sequence include the dfg-triplet  <cit>  . it is known, these amino acids are responsible for anchoring the phosphate donor atp  <cit> . so this splice variant should produce an inactive form of stk <dig> kinase. the recombinantly expressed stk33δ isoform was tested for both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of substrates such as vimentin wildtype and casein. as a positive control pka catalytic subunit was used because it readily phosphorylates casein. this pka catalytic subunit is not able to phosphorylate itself. recombinant vimentin wildtype protein and different deletion derivatives expressed in e. coli were used as major targets in the assay. one technical problem had to be circumvented: recombinant stk <dig> and wildtype vimentin have a very similar electrophoretic mobility, and as we could show stk <dig> is able to perform autophosphorylation. thus on normal page a discrimination between autophosphorylated stk <dig> and phosphorylated wildtype vimentin is hardly possible. therefore, the vimentin wildtype monomer was treated with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde  <cit>  to form crosslinked vimentin tetramers with an apparent molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda . this tetramer form of vimentin was included in the phosphorylation assay. furthermore a number of vimentin mutants with different molecular weights were used in the kinase assay . the deletion variants of human vimentin used are Δ <dig>  Δ  <dig>  Δ  <dig>  Δ  <dig> and Δ  <dig>  the numbers indicate how many amino acids were deleted from the amino-terminus . in addition, a mutant vimentin missing the entire non-α-helical amino-terminal domain  was employed.

recombinant mouse stk <dig> kinase was incubated with γ 32p atp with the various substrates under optimized conditions tested previously. the reaction products were separated by sds-page and detected by direct autoradiography. the results clearly demonstrate  that: i) stk <dig>  is able to perform autophosphorylation. the incubation of stk <dig> without any other substrate  leads to a strong radiolabeled band with an apparent molecular weight corresponding to the one of stk <dig> ; ii) the derivative of stk <dig>  stk33δ in which part of the kinase domain is deleted is not able to perform autophosphorylation . furthermore, stk33δ is not able to phosphorylate any of the tested substrates  in contrast to stk <dig> ; iii) stk <dig> clearly phosphorylates vimentin in vitro . by using the vimentin tetramer as substrate, differentiation between autophosphorylated stk <dig> and phosphorylated vimentin wildtype is clearly possible .

when stk <dig> is incubated together with wildtpye vimentin and the deletion variants Δ <dig> to Δ <dig>  a preferred phosphorylation of vimentin over stk <dig> is observed, however, there is always a basic autophosphorylation of stk <dig> recognizable . so far it is not clear, whether the autophosphorylation is a prerequisite for the kinasing activity of stk <dig> or whether also unphosphorylated stk <dig> is able to phosphorylate vimentin. the limited resolution of deletion variants Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> in the gel might be related to a different extent of phosphorylation in truncated vimentin Δ <dig> compared to Δ <dig> and therefore a changed electrophoretic mobility might be the consequence, but this is speculation.

notably, the truncation mutants Δ <dig>  Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> are phosphorylated to a higher extent than Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> . therefore we conclude that, since headless vimentin is not phosphorylated at all, only the head domain of vimentin is phosphorylated and furthermore that sites both on the first  <dig> amino acids and sites after amino acid  <dig> up to the end of the head domain are phosphorylated.

as seen in figure 2e, lane  <dig> it is difficult to visualize the only minute different position between autophosphorylated stk <dig> and vimentin on an autoradiograph as stk <dig> and vimentin have the same electrophoretic migration behaviour in a page. the samples on the gel of the autoradiography  <dig> d were electrophoretically resolved by a longer running time than  <dig> e to achieve a better separation. therefore, in lane  <dig>  figure 2e  the resolution is not good enough to resolve the two proteins of nearly identical molecular weight and electrophoretic mobility. vimentin phosporylated by stk <dig>  or by pka  appears to migrate slightly different. the extent of phosphorylation might be different inducing a phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift on gels.

immunoprecipitation
in order to prove that stk <dig> and vimentin are also in vivo associated proteins co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. as a positive control recombinant nearly full length stk <dig> protein was precipitated using protein a sepharose and anti-stk <dig> antibody  <cit> . for all co-immunoprecipitation experiments sertoli cell culture serw <dig> was used. all protein samples  were analyzed by sds-page after preheating in non-reducing laemmli buffer. therefore, the main portion of igg molecules is still present. the appearance of a band corresponding to the igg heavy chain is perhaps explainable because of heating during probe preparation.

cellular stk <dig> could be readily immunoprecipitated from protein extracts of cultured sertoli cells serw <dig> . the apparent molecular weight of the immunoprecipitated stk <dig> is obviously the same as the stk <dig> protein detected in unprecipitated serw <dig> total protein extracts . the additional bands  probably arise from the igg molecules not removed from the reactions mixtures .

to analyse whether vimentin was co-precipitated by the precipitation with anti-stk <dig>  a western blot analysis was carried out with the identical material as used for the western blot in figure 4b but for the detection an anti-vimentin antibody was used. recombinant human vimentin wildtype protein was included in the analysis as a positive control . co-immunoprecipitation from cellular extracts suggests that stk <dig> and vimentin could be associated in vivo . in addition to the detection of vimentin in the precipitate, there was some vimentin in the washing buffer of the first washing step . the following washing steps did not show any vimentin in the washing buffer , and hence it is highly improbable that insufficient washing of the precipitate is responsible for the vimentin content. the results indicate clearly, that stk <dig> and vimentin are in vivo associated proteins.

co-sedimentation assay
to test whether stk <dig> binds directly to vimentin, an in vitro co-sedimentation assay was performed. by analyzing the sedimented proteins via western blotting experiments we could show, that recombinant stk <dig> precipitated  and that vimentin is successfully co-sedimentated  using anti-stk <dig> for precipitation. this suggests that vimentin binds directly to stk <dig> and that none intermediate protein mediates the association.

testing enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated stk <dig> by a kinase assay
the incubation of radioactive γ 32p atp and recombinant vimentin protein with the co-immunocomplex obtained by co-precipitation of stk <dig> and vimentin shows that immunoprecipitated stk <dig> has kinase activity  and is able to phosphorylate recombinant vimentin . the enzymatic activity of the precipitated enzyme might be reduced by storing the immunocomplex at 4°c during time for western blotting experiments to check for successful co-immunoprecipitation which is a prerequirement for testing the enzymatic activity of stk <dig>  a third protein with an apparent molecular weight of about  <dig> kda seems to be also co-precipitated by anti-stk <dig> since a radioactively labelled additional band appears after autoradiography . as this additional band is not visible after anti-stk <dig> reaction it is probably not a splice variant of stk <dig> 

discussion
the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the novel serine/threonine kinase stk <dig> phosporylates the intermediate filament protein vimentin. the motivation to test this was a striking colocalization of vimentin and stk <dig> in various tissues and differentiated cells . the results of the in vitro kinase assays and of the co-immunoprecipitation studies are very clear:

stk <dig> is able to phosporylate vimentin in vitro and vimentin and stk <dig> form a complex in vivo which can be readily co-precipitated by the use of an anti-stk <dig> antibody. stk <dig> binds directly to vimentin as determined by the co-sedimentation assay. therefore, none intermediate protein mediates this association. we conclude that stk <dig> plays a specific role in the dynamic behaviour of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton by phosphorylation of vimentin. it is known that phylogenetically related genes often have similar functions. thus it is not too surprising that stk <dig> -a member of the family of ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases  <cit> - is able to phosphorylate vimentin. camkii among other kinases is one of the major kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin  <cit> . in that respect it is interesting that stk <dig> undergoes autophosphorylation. whether the autophosphorylation of stk <dig> is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation of vimentin is not known. however, it is known, that autophosphorylation is the key event in the phosphorylation process of other members of the camk group  <cit> .

intermediate filament proteins form the largest family of cytoskeletal proteins in mammalian cells. intermediate filament proteins can be classificated into six types based on their gene structure, sequence homology and immunological and/or assembly properties  <cit> . vimentin belongs to type iii of intermediate filament proteins which also comprises desmin, gfap and peripherin.

if proteins are composed of an amino-terminal head, a central rod and a carboxy-terminal tail  <cit> . the rod domain is subdivided into further segments by non-α-helical regions, called linker. the head domain is essential for if assembly and the tail for the control of lateral association. dimerization is mediated by the rod-domain.

most of the kinases phosphorylate sites on if proteins located in the amino-terminal non α-helical head domain   <cit> , protein kinase c  <cit> , camkii  <cit> , p21-activated kinase   <cit> ). stk <dig> shows similar head domain specificity: it phosphorylates different head domain deletion derivatives, but is not able to phosphorylate vimentin in which the head domain is deleted completely. vimentin with  <dig> amino acids missing from the animo-terminus is still phosphorylated by stk <dig> in contrast to vimentin missing  <dig> amino acids. therefore we conclude that stk <dig> phosphorylates one or more of the phosphorylation sites known from other kinases. the potential phosphorylation sites beyond the head domain   <cit>  and in the tail domain of vimentin  <cit>  are not phosphorylated by stk <dig>  we can therefore be rather confident that the phosphorylation sites for stk <dig> are located in the vimentin head-domain.

in spite of the differentiation- and tissue-specific expression patterns, the function of the intermediate filament proteins has long been considered to be just structural. by forming a continuous network stretched from the nuclear surface to the cell membrane and associated in tight interaction with the nuclear lamina and the nuclear cytoskeleton, it is assumed that intermediate filaments modulate and control signal transduction  <cit> . the dynamic behaviour of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton is under control of kinases and phosphatases leading to structural changes of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton like reorganization, solubilization or collapse. various types of serine/threonine protein kinases phosphorylate intermediate filament proteins in vitro leading to disassembly of the filament structure  <cit> . up to now we do not yet know whether phosphorylation of vimentin by stk <dig> causes disassembly albeit this is conceivable because high levels of vimentin phosphorylation often lead to structural alterations of the filament system.

the remodelling between polymerized intermediate filaments  and non-filamentous particles is regulated by kinases  <cit> . among the different structural filament forms the non-filamentous precursors  are the most interesting  <cit> . it has been reported that these particles can move long distances at high speed along microtubules with the help of molecular motors  <cit> . filament precursors are delivered to special regions within the cell, where an assembly to long intermediate filaments takes place. such flexibility enables cell movement and reorganization of the cytoplasm. interestingly, the bi-directional movement of vimentin intermediate filaments along microtubule enables a kinase signaling over long distances within a cell. this is of special interest in neurons, where signals generated in axonal or dendritic processes have to travel long distances to the cell body , especially to the nucleus, where the kinase can affect gene expression. the transport complex consisting of phosphorylated map kinase erk1/ <dig>  importin β and dynein requires vimentin particles for movement along microtubule fibres in injured neurons  <cit> . normally, adult neurons express only terminally differentiated neuronal intermediate filament proteins like neurofilament proteins, but translationally silenced vimentin mrna is activated and synthesized in lesioned nerves. as only soluble vimentin particles are capable of binding a kinase, de novo synthesized vimentin protein has to be disassembled into particles by phosphorylation or by modification through proteolysis  <cit> . de novo synthesized vimentin is therefore exposed to high calcium concentrations that prevent assembly of vimentin particles to filaments due to vimentin phosphorylation by camkii  <cit>  or due to calpain-mediated cleavage of vimentin  <cit> . the creation of the kinase/vimentin complex is only possible with a phosphorylated kinase and it is promoted at high ca2+concentrations . on the contrary, the complex dissociates near the cell body where the ca2+ concentrations are low  <cit> . during the retrograde transport dephosphorylation of perk is avoided as long as vimentin stays bound to the kinase. vimentin hides phosphorylated residues in the kinase and therefore confines the access of the phosphatase to these residues  <cit> . furthermore, other interacting partners are not capable of binding to the kinase, which in turn guarantees the specificity of the transmitted signal. interestingly, this kinase transport mechanism described for lesioned nerves is not possible in vimentin null mice  <cit> . besides several defects  vimentin-null mice show a defective wound repair  <cit> , which might be related to the deficit of vimentin-dependent signaling as described for lesioned nerves  <cit> .

the dynamic changes of the intermediate filament organization are particularly prominent during cell movement or mitosis and cell division. there is a constant state of flux between non-filamentous components, short filaments and long filaments. in some but not all cell types, vimentin filaments disassemble into aggregates and short filaments during metaphase  <cit> . the organizational changes observed during mitosis are accompanied by a significant increase in the phosphorylation state. site-specific mutation of vimentin and therefore changes in potential phosphorylation sites have been demonstrated to induce the formation of intermediate filament bridges between unseparated daughter cells  <cit> . to elucidate the precise molecular function of stk <dig> in vimentin phosphorylation, it is important to determine the specific phosphorylation sites on vimentin by stk <dig> which is planned for the future.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the serine/threonine kinase stk <dig> phosphorylates the intermediate filament protein vimentin in vitro specifically in the vimentin head domain. stk <dig> undergoes obligatory autophosphorylation, which might be a prerequisite for its kinasing activity. by co-immunoprecipitation we were able to co-isolate vimentin together with stk <dig> using a polyclonal anti-stk <dig> antibody. from this result we conclude that stk <dig> and vimentin are interacting protein partners also in vivo. this conclusion is strongly supported by the observation that stk <dig> and vimentin can be found together in many very specialized cells and tissues . we propose that stk <dig> is involved in the dynamics of intermediate filament assembly/disassembly through a specific and regulated phosphorylation of vimentin.
