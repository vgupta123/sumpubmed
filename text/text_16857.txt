BACKGROUND
mobile genetic elements , mostly represented in the eukaryota by transposable elements, are selfish dna integrated in the genomes. they can vary in length , sequence content, copy number  and biological properties from organism to organism . the whole collection of the mges hosted in a genome is the mobilome <cit> . the main relation between mges and the host genome is fundamentally parasitic: mges tend to replicate by exploiting the resources of the host  <cit> . by doing this they can destabilize the host organism, as the mutations induced by their jumps or replications can result in gene inactivation or modification. for instance, in the human genome, mges are estimated to be around 45% of the total size. hence, they are a great source of variability and possible diseases, hard to explain by standard inheritance  <cit> .

the interaction between mges and the host organisms is more complex and still debated in different aspects: apart from the usual parasitic relation, there are also other kinds of interactions, such as direct competition or, at the opposite, cooperation towards synergizing mges and their host . this scenario suggests to look at genomes, and in particular at eukariotic genomes, as evolving ecosystems. here the immotile genome  and the mges act like different species competing for the available biochemical resources  <cit> – <cit> .

while population genomists study the mobilome paying particular attention to the dynamics of the mges, evolutionary biologists attempt to define the contribution of the mobilome in the evolution of the host organisms. several studies in evolutively distant organisms suggest that the mobilome has a great impact on the fate of the host. some evidence supporting this conjecture has been found in all the living kingdom, from prokaryotes  <cit>  to higher eukaryotes  <cit> – <cit>  including human  <cit> . this supports a proposed evolutionary paradigm, where the mobilome drives the evolution of the host organism  <cit> .

the detection of mges is mainly based on consensus–like searches, thus scanning the investigated genome against the sequence of an already identified mge. the identification of new classes of mges is a multi–step process that includes chromosomic regions alignments and/or feature detection like testing for the presence of specific repeats and of specific promoters, which depend on the mges features in the given organism. we refer to  <cit>  for a recent review of the available tools. even though these procedures are good at reaching their goals ), the whole process can be considered still not efficient, as they cannot guarantee the identification of new classes of mges. experimental procedures can mark the location of mges in a genome, also by exploiting high–throughput techniques, but only on the bases of known transposable elements sequences which constitute the probes spotted on the micro–array  <cit> . we observe that the experimental mapping techniques suffer of the same limitations as the ones described for the other approaches: they need to know the sequence of any class of mges, and can give rise to false positive or false negative results on the basis of the similarity between the scanned sequence and the mge used as a probe.

the importance of having an exhaustive knowledge about the mobilome in an organism motivates the study of this paper. by analogy with other holistic approaches, it is called mobilomics and its main goals are:  providing approaches for a rapid and exhaustive identification of all the mobilome elements in an organism;  tracking their movements  during evolution;  developing dynamic models able to forecast the fate of the relations between the mobilome and the host genome.

the main contribution of our paper is addressing points –, whereas point  is to be considered a long–term goal. note that we already addressed point  in preliminary work  <cit> , proposing an approach aimed at globally identifying mges by an extensive and iterative use of comparative genomics. we expand the preliminary results of  <cit>  and fully discuss point  in this paper. as for point , our approach follows the rationale that chromosomal mutations induced by mges elements are more frequent with respect to those spanning over segments and uncorrelated with the mobilome  <cit> . consequently, we assume as working hypothesis that when we compare very close organisms , the observed chromosomal mutations involving sequences longer than a certain threshold are mainly due to mge events.

consider for example the situation in which a strain presents a duplication or a jump of an mgee into a new location. this will interleave the homology of that region with that of another strain where e was quiescent. under this situation, we perform an alignment of homologous chromosomes and mark the non–homologous “island” surrounded by homologous sequences as putative mge  to indicate the possibility of an occurrence of an mgee.

mobilomics comes into play by progressively extending the above alignment to other strains : the set of pmes becomes more and more populated by all the mges that effectively moved or replicated. clearly, this approach is prone to errors, since we may have both false positives and false negatives. on one hand, an mgee that did not move for that set of organisms, would not be marked this way. on the other hand, a chromosomal mutation uncorrelated with the mobilome could be marked as pme. nevertheless, our approach exhibits two major advantages with respect to the previous literature. first, it does not require any template sequence for the wanted mges. second, it can be applied also to low coverage genomes with unspecified bases, where traditional approaches are largely ineffective.

we illustrate our approach using a case study represented by a set of  <dig> strains of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the genome sequences recently released by  <cit> . they have a low coverage , and so they are unannotated and rich of unresolved regions . to have a referral point, we adopt the s288c strain, called refseq hereafter, as it is fully sequenced and annotated in the sgd database  <cit> , along with its mges.

different reasons led us to choose the yeast to perform this study. first, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only organism having so many different strains sequenced, thus allowing us to have a large dataset for our tests. second, the yeast is probably the most known organism from a molecular point of view. indeed, refseq is accurately annotated: mges in refseq are almost all ltr–retrotransposons, here called ty . as of today, five different families of ty are reported, appearing in several copies on the  <dig> chromosomes, the positions of which are annotated  <cit> . the ty dynamics is actually more involved: first tys are copied, then the original template is eventually deleted and the two events are almost simultaneous  <cit> . hence, the transposition event in the yeast is not properly a jump nor a movement but, for the sake of simplicity, we will adopt the latter terms in the rest of the paper, with the above proviso.

it is worth noting that caspi and pachter  <cit>  also present an approach based on comparative genomics. however, their ideas and implementation are completely different from ours. in their first phase, caspi and pachter cluster genomes into homology regions, building an homology map, and then align only homologous tracts. this homology map is based also on evolutionary considerations . this is completely missing in our approach when aligning chromosomes. in their second phase, caspi and pachter use a multi–alignment tool, while we always proceed via pair–alignment using our software tool regender. in their third phase, caspi and pachter interpret the data coming from the multi–alignment using a suitable evolutionary tree as input, onto which they map the results. even in this step, our methodology is completely different, as we try to infer evolutionary relationships as an outcome, and not to use evolutionary data coming from other sources as input data.

approach
the application of progressive comparative genomics to pmes inference represents an approach driven by data analysis, which has been developed in three main steps.


first step

we exploit the high similarity among the genomes of the considered yeast strains, to obtain a rapid and efficient masking of the conserved regions to highlight the non–conserved regions, where any mge that has actually moved is presumably located. this step led us to write and implement an algorithm, called regender, able to perform the extraction of conserved regions between very large sequences in a fast and efficient way. it is presented in the detail in section “methods” of this paper, and it is publicly available at  <cit> .


second step

we apply regender to a pairwise comparison of all the  <dig> chromosomes of refseq to their homologous ones in two selected strains, so as to analyze the detected non–conserved regions—how they can be classified and how they relate with mges.


third step

we perform a simultaneous masking of all the conserved regions in the  <dig> strains, and a marking of all the pmes. by focusing on the complete ty sequences annotated in refseq, we perform a validation of the marked sequences and their effective relation with the mobilome.

some preliminary results about our data analysis with the proposed algorithm  have been presented in a conference  <cit> . in this paper we extend these results and perform a deeper study of pairwise comparisons to show the complete and de novo results for the multiple strain comparison. to our surprise, clustering the binary vectors obtained by marking the presence/absence of candidate mges in each of the strains provides an interesting evolutionary relation among the strains: it is quite close to that inferred by classic phylogenetic methods based on snps analysis.

RESULTS
preliminary data analysis
following the usual notation of the genome browser at ucsc  <cit> , we name a chromosome pair , where 1 ≤ n ≤  <dig> is the chromosome number, a is refseq and b is either y55 or yps128 . we chose the latter two strains as testing samples because of their evolutionary distance and different degree of engineerization in labs . by defining an l–gram as a segment of l consecutive bases , we examined all the possible  l–grams of chrnb as candidates.

note that the l–grams thus examined are m - l +  <dig> in number, accounting for possible duplicates, where chrnb contains m bases. call valid the l–grams containing only resolved bases. the commonl–grams are the valid l–grams that occur exactly  both in chrna and chrnb.

when b is y <dig>  the values of m are in the range  <dig> 230… <dig>  <dig> 657; when b is yps <dig>  the values of m are in the range  <dig> 809… <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  in our experiments, l =  <dig> resulted to be a good choice . the following empirical facts were observed for chromosomes n =  <dig> ,…, <dig>  with chromosome n =  <dig> being an outlier .

 the validl–grams are numerous: they are between  <dig> % –  <dig> % in y <dig> and between  <dig> % –  <dig> % in yps128 .

 the commonl–grams are also numerous: they are between  <dig> % –  <dig> % in y55 and between  <dig> % –  <dig> % in yps <dig> .

 the common l–grams that occurs once are the vast majority: indeed, those occurring two or more times are very few, between  <dig> % –  <dig> % in y55 and  <dig> % –  <dig> % in yps <dig> 

a summary reporting the above percentages for the l–grams in the  <dig> chromosomes of y55 is shown in . an implication of observations –  is that we can localize the conserved regions using the common l–grams.

pairwise analysis and pmes inference
by using regender, we then executed the pairwise comparison on all the  <dig> chromosomes of the two selected sample strains against refseq. regender has proven to be very fast: for instance, it can process the longest pair of chromosomes  in only  <dig> seconds on a standard machine; the global experiment involving the three strains has required less than  <dig> minutes. compared with other existing similar tools, regender turns out to be, on average, from four to ten times faster. more details are provided in supplementary material .

a graphical representation of the output of regender is reported in figure  <dig>  where the top line always represents a region of a chromosome of refseq, while the bottom line represents the same region in either y55 or yps128; a vertical line is drawn when a common l–gram is found between the two chromosomes. mges annotated in refseq are represented by green rectangles placed just below the top line, while unresolved sequences are represented by black rectangles placed just above the bottom line. dealing with unresolved sequences represents the true challenge of working with the given dataset: in fact, unresolved sequences are too many to be ignored, and, moreover, they are often linked to mges, as it will appear in the following. the overall scenario emerging from regender is that most of the chromosomes are constituted by conserved regions: they are graphically covered by a uniform color zone given by the succession of parallel straight lines connecting identical l–grams. conserved regions are marked as cons on figure  <dig>  more than 95% in y <dig> and 93% in yps <dig> are conserved regions, and they can contain also mges: we found one truly conserved ty per strain and a few number of conserved solo–ltrs.

this uniform coverage can be interrupted when, for example, the screened strain has a long run of unresolved bases. these unresolved sequences are graphically marked by black rectangles. when the lines connecting their flanking regions are all parallel, it is likely that this fragment contains exactly the same sequence as refseq. in this case, we have an example of putative conservation, marked as pconsu, that graphically appears as shown in figure  <dig>  as detailed in the following, often pconsu regions occur where refseq shows annotations relative to mges and/or to chromosomic rearrangements hotspots.

cases in which there is a sequence on refseq that has no correspondent on the homologous region of the screened strain are putative deletions. deletions mainly involve the mobilome. they can occur when an mge is annotated in refseq, in which case they are marked as pdel–ty or pdel–ltr, if they occur for ty or solo–ltr, respectively. instead, they are marked as pdel when this putative deletion is not related to mges ,).

putative insertions are more difficult to categorize, as the screened strain where they take place are not annotated. if the sequence is resolved, we employ standard alignment tools to search it in refseq, trying to detect whether the fragment has actually been moved rather than deleted. on the other hand, when the sequence is unresolved, we can explore only two features. first, we check whether or not the length of the inserted sequence is compatible with either a transposon  or an solo–ltr . we found that from 40% to 50% of the cases, there is a putative mobilome–proximal insertion. second, we check whether these insertions take place in a region where an mge is annotated at a distance less than 200b in refseq. we have that the large majority of events are involved with the mobilome. for example, the event marked as “pinsu ty–c prox–mobil” in figure  <dig> accounts for an insertion in an unresolved sequence, within such a proximity  in yps128 strain with respect to refseq. since this insertion takes place less than 200b away from an solo–ltr annotated in refseq, we consider this event as “proximal” to an mge. this is relevant, since several observations in the literature suggest that tys prefer to migrate in zones where there are solo–ltrs  <cit> . finally, figure  <dig> shows an event of “pins ty–c” since the inserted sequence length is compatible with a transposon.

these cases cover the whole spectrum of the situations we have found in our screening. a complete representation of all the  <dig> chromosomes in both the strains used for this first screening is available at the link “plots” in  <cit> .

we now give a detailed discussion on conserved and non–conserved regions. recall that the latter ones are found as deletions and insertions. deletions occur when there is a sequence in refseq that has no correspondent on the homologous region of the other strain. insertions are almost point–wise and non–conserved regions in refseq to which longer non–conserved regions correspond in the homologous chromosome of the other strain. they are more difficult to categorize because only one strain  is annotated and there can be several unspecified bases inside them. typically 40–50% of the cases show that an insertion is proximal as well as comparable in length to mobilome.

table  <dig> shows the data collected for conserved regions. different ty classes are considered: ty <dig> and ty <dig> are the most represented in the ty panorama of refseq , while ty <dig>  ty <dig> and ty <dig> occur just  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> times, respectively. most of conserved regions are part of the resident genome, but not all of them. the fraction of conserved tys or solo–ltrs within conserved regions contains two possible elements:  the truly conserved tys  or solo–ltrs , which are exactly mapped from refseq into the other screened strain;  the putative conservations of annotated tys or solo–ltrs, which are mapped into unresolved sequences in the screened strain . the pconsu are always found in the telomeres because the presence of long repeats is a source of noise for the assembly phase. in all cases but one, telomeres do not involve sequences related with mges. concerning pconsu that are outside the telomeres, the number of unresolved sequences that are located in correspondence or in proximity of mges, is greater than 90% for y55 and around 70% for yps <dig>  this supports the hypothesis that unresolved regions are often located in correspondence of an mge annotated in refseq.

conserved regions  and putative conserved regions with unspecified bases  vs annotated ty and solo–ltr in refseq, when pairwise compared either to strain y <dig> or strain yps <dig> 

the pconsu regions are classified either as telomeric or non–telomeric. moreover, the non–telomeric regions which are conserved on refseq are divided in three classes, depending on their position w.r.t. annotated mge on refseq: pconsu which are labelled as “in–mobil” correspond to annotated mge on refseq; pconsu which are labelled as “prox–mobil” are out of annotated mge but within a distance of ±200b from annotated ty or solo–ltr; pconsu which are more distant are labelled as “out–mobil”.

tables  <dig> and  <dig> refers to non–conserved regions. deletions occur very often in correspondence to mobilome annotations and the different classes are deleted similarly in the two strains and uniformly with respect to their global distribution on the genome. concerning the putative deleted regions  in refseq that do not correspond to annotated tys nor to solo–ltrs, say in y55 strain : we found that the length of the two regions is compatible with that of a solo–ltr. inserted regions whose length is compatible with that of a ty are analogous between the two strains, while y55 strain shows fewer regions proximal to mobilome and more insertions of intermediate length, with respect to yps <dig> 

putative deleted regions  vs annotated ty and solo–ltr and non–annotated regions in refseq. labels “ty–c” and “ltr–c” refer to putative deleted regions whose lengths are compatible with ty or solo–ltr lengths. label “in–between” refers to region lengths which are intermediate between ty–c and solo–ltr–c.

putative inserted regions without  and with unresolved regions . label “prox–mobil” refers to regions in refseq where the insertion occurs within ±200b from ty or solo–ltr.

progressively extending pmes inference via comparative genomics
our results show that there is a strong relation between non–conserved sequences and mges, thus validating the working hypothesis at the basis of our paper. nevertheless, our approach can give rise to false positives and false negatives. false positives occur when a chromosomic mutation is erroneously marked as pme. false negatives take place when an mge falls in a conserved region of the compared genomes . to minimize the incidence of false positives, more hypotheses about the length of the chromosomic mutation and on its characteristic  have to be stated. to rule out possible false negatives, instead, one has to enlarge as much as possible the dataset for a simultaneous comparison of several genomes.

to illustrate this situation with a typical example, let us consider the region within chr. iv where two tys  are annotated in refseq. considering again the two strains y55 and yps <dig>  we have that the annotated ty <dig> is missing in both strains, while the annotated ty <dig> is conserved only in yps128 . if we considered only yps <dig>  the mobile nature of ty <dig> sequence would have not been noticed: only when considering the comparison to y <dig>  also ty <dig> is labeled pme.

our progressive addition of strains has populated the pmes set, and after the comparison of  <dig> genomes , more than 80% of the known ty in refseq have been marked as pmes, thus showing that the approach is very helpful to recognize mges.

moreover, when implementing pairwise comparisons as in figure  <dig>  an extracted non–conserved region could be marked as pme only by referring to its annotation in refseq. instead, when multiple comparison is performed, a pme can be inferred even if it is conserved in two or more strains: in order to be detected, it is sufficient to find a strain in which it is not conserved. the topology of the resulting multiple alignment, indeed, highlights mges independently of the availability of an annotation.

this approach allows us to make pmes inferences also on unannotated and low–coverage genomes, since the putative conservation or deletion may be inferred from the position and the length of the element, disregarding its sequence.

mobilomics on  <dig> strains
with these premises, we analyzed the whole dataset available for our comparison. we run regender simultaneously on the  <dig> available strains , deprived of the telomeric regions  because of their intrinsic instability. we marked a large set of pmes:  <dig> regions, which vary in their length. to collect information about their actual connection with mges we could only refer to refseq, the only annotated strain. we therefore mapped on refseq all the sequences that are recognized as pmes, and examined their possible annotations.

to discuss these aspects we focused on two kinds of pmes, based on their length: those compatible with solo–ltr elements  and those compatible with a complete ty element .


solo–ltr elements

the comparison of the pme–ltr candidates and the annotated solo–ltr led to an uncertain situation: only about 44% of the known solo–ltrs are actually marked as putative solo–ltrs. this might have two motivations. first, the large amount of undetected solo–ltrs derives from the low probability that a solo–ltr moves. indeed, since our approach can recognize only elements that are in non–conserved regions, it means that most of the solo–ltrs are conserved on all the  <dig> strains. this suggests that it is unlikely that a solo–ltr actually moves. second, it is not rare to have a chromosomal mutation that spans from 300b to 4000b on a dataset of  <dig> strains, and this populates the class of putative solo–ltrs not matching solo–ltr annotations .

concerning solo–ltr elements, our conclusion is that the comparative genomics approach is ineffective for discovering them, while repeats–finding based approaches perform better.


ty elements

the scenario for pme –ty candidates is, instead, completely different: regender marks  <dig> non–conserved regions not shorter than  <dig> b, that are present in refseq.

focusing on the performance of this kind of ty–prediction, based on sequence non–conservation, we may say that the test is highly predictive and efficient. the sensitivity sn=#truepositives#truepositives+#falsenegatives is 100%, due to the fact that there are no false negative results  and the specificity sp=#truenegatives#truenegatives+#falsepositives is also high .


genome rearrangement markers and pme –ty

we carefully inspected the available experimental annotations on pme –ty regions, paying a particular attention to those involved on genomic mutations or rearrangements, apart from the mge annotations already considered. in particular, we considered the following markers, which we indicate as grms : 

• autonomously replicating sequences  <cit>  : they represent the origins of replication in yeast genome.

• meiotic recombination hotspots  <cit>  : genomic regions where meiotic recombination double–strand dna breaks are extremely frequent. they have been associated with high–copy, short–motif microsatellites  <cit> , which play some role in mutation processes in yeast.

• evolutive and experimental breakpoints  <cit>  : evolutionary breakpoints data which are known between saccharomyces cerevisiae and the other yeast kluyveromyces waltii, and between s. cerevisiae and a hypothetical ancestor of both yeasts, as well as breakpoints reported in the experimental literature. the two categories are both shown to correlate to early firing origins of replication, contributing to genome rearrangement events.

• trna genes  <cit> : there is a close association between ty elements and trna genes .

• γ– h2a–rich loci  <cit> : high–resolution mapping of loci showing accumulation phosphorylation of histone h2ax, which is an early response to dna damage in eukaryotes and are candidate fragile loci.

• replication termination loci  <cit> :  <dig> chromosomal termination regions where replication forks stall and which express dna fragility during cell division. the existence of an evolutionary pressure against ter–containing pause sites on both strands is suggested, perhaps to avoid genome instability events.

the complete list of annotations of genomic features for each pme–ty marked region is reported in the . as a general result, we globally remark that only one region shorter than  <dig> kb contains a full–length ty association , while  <dig> regions are full–length–annotated out of  <dig> regions with length above  <dig> kb and under  <dig> kb. finally,  <dig> regions have annotated full–length, and  <dig> of them have pairs of inverted tys  out of  <dig> longer regions .

we found that  <dig> regions did not host any feature. out of the remaining  <dig> regions,  <dig> hosted at least one full–length ty annotation,  <dig> at least one solo–ltr annotation, and  <dig> host some of the above grms, different from ty and solo–ltr. many regions  do not involve active mges but correspond to loci prone to chromosomic recombination, rearrangement or fragility. we remark that all the known tys have been correctly marked as pmes: the only ty not recognized, is the unique copy of ty <dig> that appears in the telomere of chromosome iii, and that has been ruled out from this investigation because of its localization.

some comments on individual grms are in order. 

• we notice that  <dig> out of  <dig> ters associated with pme–tys  contain two divergent pol iii–dependent pause sites , one of which is proved to be totally or partially not conserved also in other yeast species  <cit> .

• there are  <dig> regions associated with evolutive breakpoints, which are relative to speciation events.

• out of  <dig> regions associated with trna genes, only one region does not correspond to annotated full–length tys nor solo–ltrs.

• ars–associated regions are likely to contain full–length tys .


similarity among pme –tys

to deeply screen the possible similarity among these  <dig> pme ty–candidates, we downloaded all these sequences from the sgd database. then we run clustalw to obtain an essay of their relative similarity. the obtained phylogram shown in figure  <dig>  clearly cluster the  <dig> input sequences into two main groups: one composed almost by ty–annotated sequences, while the other is composed almost all by non–ty sequences. it is very interesting to inspect the average distance among sub–groups in these two clusters: graphically it is represented by the length of the arcs. the cluster of ty–sequences shows an inner high relative similarity, since the arcs connecting the sub–groups are short. in the second cluster, instead, the arcs cover all the distance between the sequence and the root, thus showing an inconsistent similarity between the sequences. the only exception is represented by the sequences annotated as ty <dig>  which shows a slightly more robust relative similarity. this phylogram analysis suggests that non–ty sequences are really different from each other, and therefore they are unlikely to derive from the movements and/or duplication of a given transposable element.


statistics of pme –ty moves

we inspected the frequency of movements, by building a boolean matrix  on a length–basis: for each pme ty–candidate c and for each yeast strain s, we report  <dig> if c is present in s, and  <dig> otherwise.

summing the  <dig> values, we obtain a score between  <dig> and  <dig>  if we sort the pme–ty list accordingly to these values, we have a clear view on which non–conserved regions are still present in which strains. we can sharply divide the  <dig> pme–ty regions into two groups: those length–conserved in  <dig> strains  and those conserved in a lower number of strains .

we observe that  <dig> out of  <dig> sequences corresponding to annotated tys are fully non–conserved since they score less than  <dig> , while only  <dig> out of  <dig> of the non–ty  annotated pme–ty are fully non–conserved. in other words, while regender identified non–conserved regions w.r.t. sequence conservation, these regions have not necessarily moved in all the examined strains. there are only  <dig> ty–annotated pme sequences that appear to maintain their position, possibly with a change in their sequence, across the genomes, but the large disequilibrium between the frequencies of jumps allows us to say that false positive sequences tend to be resident. out of  <dig> regions associated with evolutive breakpoints ,  <dig> are length–conserved in all  <dig> strains, thus supporting the claim that length–conservation is not a primary  event in mobilomics.

to sum up, if we use the length–conservation to distinguish pme–tys among true annotated mges  and non–mges , we get a sensitivity sn =  <dig> % and a specificity sp =  <dig> %: this again is a good test to classify mobilomics events.


mobilome tree

the fact that different sequences marked as pme ty–candidates have a different degree of presence in the different strains suggested us to try to understand the dynamics of the marked movements. by using the boolean vectors described above we generated a tree, which we call mobilome tree, obtained by scoring the distance between every pair of strains by means of hamming distance and clustering by upgma. although the obtained mobilome tree is not a phylogenetic tree, it reveals the clusters among strains obtained by minimizing the movements of pmes. it is really interesting to compare such a non–standard tree with the phylogenetic tree obtained by standard phylogenetic approaches in  <cit>  that are based on snps comparison on a set of suitably identified genes. figure  <dig> shows this comparison: here the mobilome tree is shown on the bottom, and the phylogenetic tree is shown on the top. surprisingly, most of the clades determined by following the two independent methods coincide, and this probably represents a further support of the recently established paradigm that tys are able to drive the evolution of organisms, as reported in  <cit> . since a subset of  <dig> regions are enough to map evolutive clades, it appears that the movement of a single mge in the genome of a strain is enough to address the strain’s evolution. however, this very strong hypothesis needs further evidences to be evaluated. the most remarkable fact is that the information amount needed for our approach is really minimal, and almost all obtained a priori. an interesting side observation is that this picture does not change when annotating the presence/absence of solo–ltr elements as well . also in this case the large majority of clades are identical to the classic phylogenetic tree.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we proposed an original approach to extend the comparative genomics employed to discover mobile genetic elements. we released a software tool able to perform the required computations in an efficient and powerful way. we applied this approach to the recent available dataset of  <dig> genomes of the yeast, where we proved that the approach is able to correctly identify the already known ty elements, with no false negatives. about possible false positives, we showed that they are non–conserved regions very unlikely to move and, by extending the approach, probably they will be discriminated from true mges. we also showed that the pme presence/absence seems to parallel the evolutionary history of the yeast without relying on evolutionary data coming from other sources as input data. our case study shows that the method can be applied to infer mges also for large data sets of low–coverage genomes with unresolved bases, where traditional approaches are largely ineffective. a promising avenue is to dig into the data streams arising from ngs.

future work is to extend the proposed approach to inter–specific comparisons, where the underlying hypothesis that most of the longest chromosomal mutations are due to mges should be made weaker.
