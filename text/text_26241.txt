BACKGROUND
drought stress greatly affects productivity and growth of plants and plays a central role in their geographical range. water deprivation induces a set of physiological and biochemical responses in plants and is one of the most complex adverse conditions, since it depends not only on the severity and duration of the stress event, but also on the plant developmental stage and morphology  <cit> .

soon after the perception and recognition of external changes, different signaling pathways are activated in order to convert a physical stress into a biochemical response, each of them promoting the expression of a set of stress-responsive genes; the full activation of signal cascades induced by a given stress event promotes acclimation and leads to stress tolerance.

the main physiological drought stress responses include stomatal closure, repression of cell growth and photosynthesis, and activation of respiration. at the biochemical level, many plants accumulate osmoprotectants such as sugars , sugar alcohols , amino acids , and amines   <cit> . these metabolites also act as antioxidants or scavengers helping plants to avoid and/or tolerate stresses.

drought stress triggers the production of the phytohormone abscisic acid . several drought-inducible genes are induced by exogenous aba treatment, whereas others are not affected, indicating the presence of both aba-independent and aba-dependent regulatory systems  <cit> .

many drought-inducible genes with various functions, including a number of transcription factors that regulate stress-inducible gene expression, have been identified by molecular and genomic analyses. many families of plant transcription factors are involved in the stress-induced signaling cascade. among them: bzip proteins , myc, myc-like, bhlh and myb proteins  <cit> , wrky proteins  <cit> , cbf/dreb <dig>  and dreb <dig>  <cit> . recently, a number of stress-inducible genes have been identified using microarray analysis in different plant species, such as arabidopsis, rice, barley and grape  <cit> . furthermore the ectopic expression of several stress induced genes with a key role in the stress response pathways has resulted in improved plant stress tolerance  <cit> .

in wheat, by mean of special genetic stocks , several chromosomes or chromosome regions carrying major genes affecting environmental stress response were identified  <cit> . genes affecting flowering time and abiotic stress responses in wheat are particularly concentrated on chromosomes belonging to group  <dig>  especially on 5a  <cit> . using wheat deletion stocks genes affecting frost tolerance and vernalization requirement  <cit> , copper stress tolerance  <cit> , traits affecting osmoregulation  were physically mapped between deletion breakpoint  <dig>  and the telomeric end of chromosome 5a.

the productivity of wheat, one of the most important crops worldwide, is often limited by shortage of water necessary to maximize biomass and complete grain filling  <cit> . in the present study we performed a transcriptional profiling of three wheat genotypes with different genome organization, under medium and severe drought stress conditions at the grain filling stage. we compared the hexaploid bread wheat cultivar chinese spring  with a deletion line cs-5al- <dig> carrying a chromosome deletion at the breakpoint  <dig> , and with a tetraploid durum wheat  to find evidences of differential responses associated to different wheat genome regions.

RESULTS
physiological responses
to provide a global study of transcriptome changes in response to drought stress, a durum wheat  and two bread wheat  genotypes were subjected to two different levels of water stress at the grain filling stage in controlled conditions. although the three genotypes were grown and exposed to drought in presence of the same amount of available water in the soil , their leaf water potentials were different . the plants of the durum wheat cv. creso were characterized by a more negative leaf water potential in all treatments; furthermore, they reached these values of water potential earlier than the bread wheat cv. cs  suggesting that creso underwent a faster water loss than cs, probably due to a delay in the activation of the water stress responsive mechanisms.

soil water content and leaf water potential values corresponding to control , moderate  and severe stress  in each genotype.

microarray quality analysis
genechip® hybridization quality was verified using the standard affymetrix controls. all hybridizations showed the expected checkerboard pictures. the average background was  <dig> , well within the recommended levels. the percentage of "present" calls ranged between  <dig> % and  <dig> % among the  <dig> k probe sets present on the array. durum wheat samples showed percentage of "presents" constantly lower than bread wheat samples, in agreement with their genome sizes. pearson correlation coefficients computed on the rma expression values  for each set of biological triplicates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

four main sources of variation explaining  <dig> % of total variance were identified by principal component analysis . the two main components explain  <dig> % and  <dig> % of variance . data represented on a scatter plot with the first and second components on the x and y axis, respectively, showed that the replicates of each sample clustered together, as expected. the samples belonging to bread wheat and durum wheat were completely separated on the x axis indicating that the main source of variation was due to the genotype factor. the second source of variation, along the y axis, was due to the treatment factor. ctrl, ms and ss samples of cs were well separated from each other; whereas the ms and ss samples in cs_5al- <dig>  and the ctrl and ms samples in creso were poorly separated. this finding suggests that the extent of transcriptome remodeling in ms and ss conditions was different in the three genotypes. while in cs each level of drought was sufficient to induce a strong molecular response, in creso the ms condition was not sufficient to induce a sizable response and only a minimal variation was observed in cs_5al- <dig> between ss and ms conditions.

transcriptome changes
to identify subsets of genes differentially expressed in response to drought treatments or among genotypes, the array data were analyzed using a welch t-test with benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate correction for multiple tests  <cit> . fold-change was then employed as a surrogate measure of biological significance for gene selection  <cit> .

as shown in table  <dig>  nine comparisons were done to identify drought stress-regulated genes. according with the definition given in materials and methods,  <dig>  probe sets were found to be differentially expressed . three further comparisons were performed to identify genes differentially expressed among the considered genotypes and not involved in the drought response. the comparison among the ctrl samples of creso, cs and cs_5al- <dig> has identified  <dig>  non redundant probe sets with a significantly different expression level.

in the first column analysis comparisons are listed. number of differentially expressed probe sets under drought with a minimun 2-fold change is reported. the comparisons between not stressed samples of cs, cs-5al and creso are also shown. cs = chinese spring, cs-5al = chinese spring 5a deletion line, ctrl = control condition, ms = mild stress condition, ss = severe stress condition.

the comparison between ms and ctrl samples yielded  <dig> differentially expressed probe sets in cs and  <dig> in cs_5al- <dig>  whereas in creso no significant differences were found. an opposite trend was noticed when ss samples were compared with ms ones: few changes in gene expression were observed in bread wheat samples , whereas a set of  <dig> transcripts in ss creso were significantly different from ms . finally, the comparisons between ss and ctrl samples yielded many more differentially expressed genes in creso  than in cs  , a difference of more than six hundred probe sets.

although the leaf water potential in ms plants was more negative in the durum wheat creso than in the bread wheat cs , significant variations in mrna levels in response to ms were detected only in the hexaploid genotypes.

the comparisons between the two bread wheat ctrl and the durum wheat ctrl samples gave about  <dig> differentially expressed probe sets , a result that is largely dependent on the presence of the d genome in hexaploid wheat. the comparison between cs_5al- <dig> and cs showed  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts, probably due to the partial deletion of chromosome 5a.

fifteen probe sets, representing genes putatively involved in the drought stress responses, were subjected to real-time qrt-pcr analysis to validate the array data. the poliubiquitin gene corresponding to the probe set ta. <dig> .s1_at was selected based on its minimal coefficient of variation, and used as reference gene in qrt-pcr. although the magnitude of the transcript expression was, to some extent, different between array and qrt-pcr, all tested genes showed the same expression trend with the two methods. the pearson product-moment correlation coefficients between microarray and qrt-pcr data were  <dig> ***,  <dig> *** and  <dig> *** for creso, cs and cs-5al, respectively .

qt-clustering
as mentioned above,  <dig>  probe sets were differentially expressed as a consequence of drought stress in at least one comparison . qt-cluster analysis  <cit>  was performed and interpreted to identify groups of genes whose expression can be associated to the different genome structures. bioinformatic analysis  yielded  <dig> clusters  plus  <dig> unclassified probe sets.

ten clusters  grouped  <dig> probe sets responsive to drought to a similar extent in all three genotypes . these genes represent the stress response mechanisms common to bread and durum wheat. the analysis with the mips funcat tool  <cit>  of the probe sets in the up-regulated clusters identified five main over-represented categories , most of them related to water stress . among these categories, subcategories such as " <dig> . <dig>  metabolism of proline", " <dig> . <dig> osmotic and salt stress response", " <dig> . <dig>  osmosensing and response", " <dig> . <dig>  ethylene response", " <dig> . <dig>  abscisic acid response" were all over-represented. many well known components of the molecular response to drought belong to these clusters. for instance, the expression levels of four 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid-dioxygenase -related probe sets , the key enzyme of aba biosynthesis  <cit> , were strongly up-regulated by water stress to similar extent in all genotypes.

clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are also characterized by the presence of additional stress-related signaling components and transcription factors  as well as of probe sets related to osmolyte pathways . the probe set ta. <dig> .s1_x_at has high similarity to sorbitol dehydrogenase, the key enzyme in sorbitol accumulation  <cit> . aldehyde dehydrogenases  are involved in aldehyde detoxification and the induction of genes encoding adhs was often associated to drought stress  <cit> . moreover, a substrate-specific aldehyde dehydrogenase  is responsible of glycine betaine biosynthesis  <cit> . two adh-related probe sets  and a badh-related one  were found in cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  several probe sets involved in proline accumulation were also classified in these clusters .

overall, the up-regulated clusters illustrated in figure 2a contain most of the known drought-responsive genes whose induction is conserved among all three genotypes and co-regulated with nced expression, suggesting that a large proportion of these genes might be aba-dependent. notably, the lea genes, one of the most studied family of drought-responsive sequences  <cit> , were only marginally represented among the probe sets up-regulated in response to drought in wheat during grain filling. among the  <dig> probe sets corresponding to lea genes loaded on the wheat genome array, only  <dig> were up-regulated in the experiment here described. most of them  were unclassified after cluster analysis, indicating that their expression cannot be associated with the accumulation of the other well known drought-responsive genes above described.

besides the expected drought-related induction/repression, many clusters showed an expression profile strongly dependent on the genome organization of the three genotypes analyzed. seven clusters  were characterized by a higher expression level in the ctrl of creso compared with the corresponding sample of cs and cs_5al- <dig>  the functional classification of the  <dig> probe sets belonging to these seven clusters revealed five main categories over-represented: " <dig> metabolism", " <dig> energy", " <dig> cell rescue defense and virulence", " <dig> interaction with environment", " <dig> systemic interaction with environment". the  <dig> probe sets of cluster  <dig> showed a constitutively high expression and a minimal drought induction in creso, whereas their expression was proportional to the degree of stress in cs and cs_5al- <dig>  analysis for functional categories revealed that " <dig>  c-compound and carbohydrate metabolism", " <dig>  secondary metabolism", " <dig>  photosynthesis" and " <dig>  energy conversion and regeneration" were the subcategories over-represented. these results suggest that the probe sets belonging to cluster  <dig> are mainly involved in the adaptation of photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism to drought. in bread wheat the more severe the drought stress, the higher the expression level of these genes supporting their involvement in stress adaptation. this adaptation was not observed in creso, where these mrnas showed a constitutive high level of expression.

on the contrary, clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contain probe sets whose expression levels were lower in creso than in cs and cs_5al- <dig> . part of them were not expressed at all in creso; they can therefore be considered bread wheat-specific. whereas the probe sets of cluster  <dig> were up-regulated by drought stress, clusters  <dig> and  <dig> genes were down-regulated. cluster  <dig> contains many genes known to be involved in drought and osmotic stress response such as rab <dig> dehydrin, aldose reductase , ornithine cyclodeaminase . the probe set ta. <dig> .s1_at, encoding aldose reductase, was not expressed in creso , whereas its expression level was at least two times background in cs and cs_5al- <dig> ctrls, and raised to seven times background in cs under ss. this sequence, expressed and regulated only in t. aestivum, is a typical example of a gene likely located on the d genome or regulated by genomic elements of d genome .

clusters  <dig> and  <dig> represent probe sets down-regulated by ss more in creso than in cs . many probe sets from clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are related to genes encoding microtubules, cytoskeleton elements, cell wall biosynthetic enzymes and drought-responsive proteins. a common response to drought stress in plant is a block in cell growth to reduce transpiration leaf surface  <cit> . the repression of the genes involved in the synthesis of cytoskeleton and the production of enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis/degradation support the stress-dependent reduction in cell growth. the transcriptomic data suggest that creso requires a higher stress level compared to cs to activate this response.

a peculiar expression behavior was found in the  <dig> probe sets grouped in cluster  <dig> . their expression levels were significantly up-regulated in cs_5al- <dig> exposed to ms only.  <dig> probe sets of this cluster show similarity with transposon and retrotransposon sequences.

cluster  <dig> groups probe sets slightly up-regulated by drought stress in bread wheat samples only, although the expression level of these probe sets in ctrl conditions was higher in creso than in cs . two snf1-related protein kinases  are present in cluster  <dig>  the homologous arabidopsis gene, snf1-related protein kinase  <dig> , encodes an osmotic stress-activated protein kinase. insertional mutants exhibited drought hypersensitivity in roots and, conversely, transgenic plants over-expressing snrk <dig> displayed a higher drought tolerance associated with the up-regulation of many stress-responsive genes as rd29a, cor15a, and dreb1a/cbf <dig>  <cit> .

metabolic pathways activated under drought stress: conserved and divergent features
the affymetrix genechip® wheat genome array covers all the genes corresponding to the main biosynthetic pathways. in many cases, each enzyme is represented by more than one probe set, apparently due to the existence of different isozymes and alleles. we took advantage from this feature to investigate the regulation of the enzymes involved in two main drought-related pathways leading to the accumulation of aba and proline.

thirty-two probe sets related to ten enzymes of carotenoid-aba biosynthesis are present on the affymetrix wheat microarray. figure  <dig> illustrates a schematic representation of the biosynthetic pathway  <cit>  with indication of the probe sets corresponding to the enzymes modified during drought treatment. in the additional file  <dig>  all probe sets corresponding to aba biosynthetic enzymes are listed with their expression level. the transcripts encoding nced were the most significantly up-regulated in response to drought in all genotypes . in other species, a detailed study of nced expression during water stress has shown a tight correlation between mrna expression, protein level, and aba content in dehydrated leaves and roots, indicating a regulatory role of nced in aba biosynthesis  <cit> . furthermore, over-expression of nced in tomato plants results in the over-production of aba  <cit> . the microarray carries  <dig> nced-related probe sets : four were not expressed, four were expressed and not modulated during dehydration treatment, while four probe sets  were differentially expressed with a cluster 3-related expression profile . these data support the hypothesis that, like in other plants, wheat aba synthesis is regulated mainly through transcriptional induction of nced.

in plants, the β-xanthophylls violaxanthin and neoxanthin are biosynthetic precursors of aba  <cit> . in our experiment we have indeed found that several probe sets encoding enzymes involved in β-xanthophyll biosynthesis were up-regulated by drought to the same extent in all three genotypes . ta. <dig> .s1_at, homologous to phytoene synthase  <dig> , was induced during dehydration with a cluster  <dig> type expression profile, a behavior different from what observed in maize leaves, where psy <dig>  rather than psy <dig> is induced by water stress  <cit> . a probe set encoding lycopene β-cyclase , a probe set encoding β-carotene hydroxylase  and a probe set encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase  were all induced in response to drought suggesting a general up-regulation of the whole pathway. nevertheless, whereas the expression level of the two probe sets related to lyc-β and β-ohase in ctrl and drought samples were significantly different, the zep probe set failed the statistical test even if it was induced by drought stress. abscisic aldehyde oxidase  <dig>  catalyzes the final step in abscisic acid biosynthesis in arabidopsis  <cit> . one probe set with high sequence similarity with the aao gene is carried by the wheat microarray though its expression was not modified under the tested conditions. this might suggest that in wheat aao has a different regulation profile compared to arabidopsis where this transcript is usually induced in response to drought stress  <cit> .

in plants, proline can be synthesized starting from either glutamate or ornithine. ornithine is the preferential precursor under normal conditions  <cit> , whereas proline is made directly from glutamate under stress conditions  <cit> . the glutamate-dependent pathway begins with the conversion of glutamate to pyrroline-5-carboxylate catalysed by p5cs   <cit>  . subsequently, the pyrroline-5-carboxylate is turned into proline by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase . p5cs is represented by one probe set   and its expression level was induced along with the drought stress intensity in all genotypes. the expression level in creso was constantly higher than in cs and cs_5al- <dig> samples . p5cs is considered the main regulatory enzyme in proline synthesis  <cit>  and its up-regulation in stress conditions supports proline production also in wheat plants. three probe sets showed high sequence similarity with p5cr, though no one was differentially expressed.

the synthesis of proline via the ornithine-dependent pathway is regulated by ornithine-δ-aminotransferase . five oat-related probe sets were present on the microarray, and none of them was differentially expressed . alternatively, ornithine cyclodeaminase is able to convert ornithine into proline in a one step reaction  <cit> . the ornithine cyclodeaminase-related probe set  was induced by drought stress in cs and cs_5al- <dig> , while its expression level in creso was lower than background in ctrl and ms and minimally induced in ss. no other probe sets corresponding to enzymes of proline pathway or proline catabolism were modified in the drought treated samples.

transcriptional analysis of the genes involved in proline metabolism highlighted that all genotypes activate the transcription of p5cs, although its expression level was higher in creso than in bread wheat. on the contrary, ornithine cyclodeaminase was preferentially expressed and up-regulated by drought in bread wheat . the list of probe sets related to proline metabolism and the corresponding expression levels are summarized in the additional file 3: proline-related probe sets.

expression level-based gene mapping
a specific absence of gene expression observed in durum wheat  compared to bread wheat  could be due to the localization of the corresponding genes on d genome. similarly, a specific absence of gene expression in the cs_5al- <dig> deletion line, could be due to the localization of the corresponding genes in the deleted chromosomal region. the transcriptomic data allowed the identification of genes whose expression level is very low  in all creso or cs_5al- <dig> samples and high in all cs samples. using the very stringent parameters described in materials and methods with the expression level in the "present call" more than  <dig> times the background value,  <dig> genes putatively located on the d genome and  <dig> genes putatively located on the long arm of chromosome 5a were identified. using more relaxed criteria with a threshold of  <dig> time the background value and no filter on "present calls", the analysis yielded  <dig> genes putatively located on the d genome and  <dig> genes putatively located on the long arm of chromosome 5a.

to verify this mapping assignment, a collection of randomly selected probe sets corresponding to genes putatively localized on the d genome and all probe sets putatively localized on the 5al- <dig> deleted region, were mapped as described in materials and methods. briefly, oligonucleotides able to discriminate between haplotypes were designed  and used to amplify dna from the  <dig> genotypes . the obtained pcr bands were then re-sequenced in order to confirm their correspondence to the targeted haplotype.

seventy genes putatively mapping on the d genome were analyzed. of these,  <dig> gave a useful mapping result and for  <dig> genes, haplotype "a"  was found to map on genome d. similarly,  <dig> genes, putatively located on the cs_5al- <dig> deleted region, were analyzed.  <dig> gave a specific mapping result and for  <dig> of them, haplotype "a" was found to map on cs_5al- <dig>  according to expectations. only one exception was found , with haplotype "b" mapping on cs_5al- <dig>  and haplotype "a" on all genomes. the probability of these results occurring by chance is less than  <dig>  according to the χ <dig> test for both datasets, suggesting that the criteria used to predict the chromosome/genome location based on expression data were highly reliable. since the identification of the genes putatively mapped on d genome  was based on expression data, the sequences not confirmed by mapping experiment probably represent genes whose expression is controlled by factor carried on d genome . the failure of several gene localizations could also be explained considering that the wheat genome is far from being completely sequenced; consequently a non-specific primer design is likely to occur.

the detailed results for all probe sets tested are reported in the additional file 4: d genome expression based mapping and in the additional file 5: 5al- <dig> expression based mapping.

some of the genes defined as located on the d genome , were also up-regulated by drought stress in cs. among them there are four aquaporins, an aldose reductase, a bzip transcription factor and a dehydrin . although these genes might have an effect on drought tolerance, it is unlikely that they are responsible for inter-specific differences in drought tolerance between durum and bread wheat.

among the probe sets putatively localized on chromosome 5a  there are two well known stress-related genes: the dehydrin wcor <dig> and cbf <dig>  a member of the cbf cluster involved in cold-tolerance  <cit> . the cbf locus has been precisely mapped on long arm of the chromosome 5a and represents a marker for many loci controlling traits such as cold tolerance, and amino acid content in response to salt stress  <cit>  all absent in cs_5a- <dig>  three probe sets  putatively located on long arm of chromosome 5a were also up-regulated in drought stressed cs.

discussion
changes in mrna expression following abiotic stresses have been extensively analyzed in plant species using microarrays. different stress conditions, tissues and plant species, from arabidopsis to cereal crops  <cit> , have been investigated with microarray tools to find drought-regulated genes. roots and leaves from seedlings were analyzed in wheat, barley and rice to describe the variation in gene expression induced in response to a dehydration shock imposed for few hours  <cit> . a slow-drying treatment was applied to study the transcriptome changes in wheat leaves at booting stage  <cit> , or in developing kernels in maize and rice  <cit> . the comparative analysis of these data highlight that the conservation of the molecular response to dehydration across species and across experiments is generally low despite the presence of common regulatory mechanisms. for instance, the comparison between the genes found to be up- or down-regulated in arabidopsis in response to dehydration by matsui et al.  <cit>   with those found in the experiment here described highlighted only  <dig> and  <dig> common genes for cs and creso, respectively. when talamè et al.  <cit>  compared the expression changes in leaves of barley plants subjected to slow or rapid drying, only a small portion of differentially expressed transcripts  showed similar expression profile regardless of the dynamics of the water stress treatment. variations in the response to drought depending on stress dynamics and on the stage of development were also reported for specific stress-responsive genes in durum wheat by de leonardis et al.  <cit> . these results underline the importance of selecting stress conditions and tissues representing a physiological status that has a relevant role during field growth to identify pathways with a field relevant role in stress tolerance. in the present work, bread and durum wheat plants were subjected to a slow drought stress during grain filling, a critical stage for yield determination. the expression analysis was carried out on glumes, the last green and photosynthetically active tissues during grain filling. for these reasons our work, more than others, should give a close representation of a yield-relevant drought response.

the durum and the bread wheat genotypes considered in this work showed different reactions to the water stress treatment when grown in soils with the same amount of available water. cs and cs_5al- <dig> were characterized by less negative leaf water potential values and they took much longer than durum wheat to reach these values, suggesting that a moderate water stress can already induce in these genotypes a response leading to a lower water loss. differences in response to water stress between hexaploid and tetraploid genotypes were already described in previous reports. gavuzzi et al.  <cit>  compared  <dig> bread wheat,  <dig> durum wheat and  <dig> barley genotypes for physiological parameters following water stress, and found that bread wheat had the smallest water loss values. in a similar experiment, two hexaploid genotypes exhibited a higher level of proline with respect to two tetraploids in response to drought  <cit> . in our experiment, bread and durum wheat were characterized by a significantly different drought response.  <dig> probe sets were above the induction threshold when ms and ctrl samples were compared in cs. on the contrary, in creso no probe set was above the induction threshold in the same comparison and only in ss vs ms and ss vs ctrl comparisons was possible to identify significantly induced/repressed genes. for instance, a set of genes encoding microtubule subunits and cell wall degradation enzymes was found down-regulated in creso after the ss only . these transcriptional changes suggest a block in cell division and/or elongation supporting a smaller transpiring surface, a typical component of the plant drought response  <cit> . these observations indicate that the ability of cs to maintain a higher water potential during drought stress is associated to a more prompt molecular response, while creso needs a more severe drought stress to activate any transcriptional response.

although durum wheat and bread wheat are two distinct species with a different genome organization , their share the same a and b genomes. the similarity between bread and durum wheat for sequences carried on a and b genomes is very high. chantret et al.  <cit> , studying the hardeness locus  in the a and b genomes of durum and bread wheat, highlighted that the two species share 97% and 99% of nucleotide identity for a and b genome, respectively. furthermore, in a preliminary bioinformatic experiment,  <dig> randomly selected durum wheat ests  were blasted to find the corresponding bread wheat sequences. considering the blast best matches of all queries a mean identity of  <dig> %  and a mean coverage of  <dig> % were calculated, a results in agreement with the data of chantret et al. the high level of genome identity between bread and durum wheat sustains the use of the same microarray for comparison of the transcriptomes of the two species, although the estimated 2% of sequence polymorphisms might lead to a small over-estimation of the transcriptomic differences.

in well-irrigated conditions, the cs  and creso  transcriptomes were very different. about  <dig>  thousand genes were found to be differentially expressed between the two wheat species  on a total amount of approximately  <dig>  expressed genes detected in bread wheat. although about 80% of the genes expressed in absence of stress were common between creso and cs, the drought response in the two genotypes was significantly different.  <dig>  genes were above the threshold in the ss vs ctrl in creso, while only  <dig> were detected in the same comparison in cs  and among these genes only  <dig> were in common.

the analysis of the molecular response to drought revealed both common and genotype-specific features. a set of  <dig> genes were clustered in groups showing a very similar expression profile in creso and cs . notably, many genes involved in well known drought-responsive pathways  were commonly activated in all genotypes. the expression levels of the nced-related probe sets, the key enzyme of aba biosynthesis  <cit> , were strongly up-regulated by water stress in all genotypes suggesting that the drought treatment imposed during the experiment entailed the activation of the aba synthesis. in arabidopsis, the accumulation of aba in response to water deficit leads to the induction of the transcription factor at-hb <dig>  that, in turn, activates the expression of at-rd <dig>  <cit> . the probe sets coding for hb <dig> and rd <dig> wheat homologous sequences  were co-regulated with nced and grouped in cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, suggesting that this specific response is conserved in wheat.

other genes grouped in commonly up- or down-regulated clusters play a role in primary metabolism, energy regulation, cell rescue or interaction with environment.

on the contrary, evidences for drought-responsive features associated to the different genomic structure of creso, cs and cs_5a- <dig> were also present. some drought-related genes were expressed at lower level  in creso or in cs_5a- <dig> compared to cs , this finding can, to some extent, be associated to the absence of the d genome . consequently, these genes could be located on the d genome , as demonstrated for some of them by expression based mapping, or could be controlled by genetic factors located on the d genome . furthermore, several clusters were characterized by a higher expression level in creso or in cs_5a- <dig> than in cs , underlining that the different genome organization have a direct consequence on plant adaptation to stress. the 5al- <dig> deleted region carries the cbf cluster  <cit> . although originally described as cold-regulated, the cbf transcription factors are also induced during exposure to drought in wheat  <cit> . the absence of an important class of stress-related transcription factors can lead to modifications in the expression of many other genes located overall the genome. furthermore, the analysis of the genes involved in the proline biosynthetic pathway have suggested an up-regulation of the ornithine-dependent pathway in bread wheat , while the enhanced expression of a set of transposons and retrotransposons was detected in cs_5al- <dig> only. it is known that transposon and retrotransposon expression can be activated by biotic/abiotic stresses  <cit> , our data suggest that the combination of abiotic stress with a "genetic stress" due to chromosomal deletion represent a suitable condition for a general up-regulation of transposon and retrotransposon-related mrnas.

CONCLUSIONS
bread and durum wheat genotypes were characterized by different physiological reactions to the applied drought stress and by clearly different molecular responses. a moderate stress was sufficient to produce a significant change in expression level of hundreds of transcripts in cs and cs_5al- <dig>  while only a severe water stress could produce a similar molecular response in creso, suggesting that cs and cs_5al- <dig> activated protection mechanisms faster and more efficiently than creso. the genome organization accounted for differences in the expression level of hundreds of genes located on d genome or controlled by regulators located on the d genome. when a genomic stress  was combined with the low water availability, a molecular response based on the activation of transposons and retrotransposons was observed.
