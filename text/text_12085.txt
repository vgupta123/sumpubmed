BACKGROUND
candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans and colonizes as commensal up to  <dig> – 70% of healthy individuals  <cit> . however, patients with a compromised immune system are at high risk to acquire systemic infections by candida spp., which constitute the fourth highest cause for nosocomial bloodstream infections with a lethality rate of up to 40%  <cit> . one of the reasons for the success of c. albicans as a pathogen is its high adaptability to various environmental niches, which are characterized by the availability of nutrients and essential elements.

iron is essential for almost all organisms as it is a co-factor for a variety of proteins. it was shown that iron acquisition by pathogens is a limiting factor for fungal, bacterial and protozoan infections  <cit> . pretreatment with iron chelators protected endothelial and epithelial cells from c. albicans mediated injury, while loading cells with iron reversed this effect  <cit> . genes of iron acquisition proteins were upregulated during c. albicans liver tissue infection  <cit> . moreover, iron availability was linked to drug resistance as well as to morphology of this fungus  <cit> .

iron accessibility for pathogens is restricted in mammalian hosts by proteins which bind iron with high affinity, such as hemoglobin, transferrin and ferritin. pathogens have developed different strategies for iron acquisition to counteract this restricted iron environment inside the host.

three systems for iron uptake by c. albicans are known:  a heme uptake system allowing the utilization of iron bound to hemoglobin, including hemoglobin receptors, e.g. rbt5p  <cit> .  the receptor sit1p, which allows c. albicans to acquire iron from ferrichrome type siderophores  <cit> . considering the lack of genes required for siderophore biosynthesis in c. albicans, it is believed that this pathway allows the uptake of iron bound to siderophores produced by other pathogens or commensals  <cit> .  the reductive pathway, whereby ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron by membrane associated ferric reductases  <cit> , before it is reoxidized by members of the multicopper ferroxidase  family  <cit> . mcfos form together with the iron permease ftr1p a high affinity iron uptake  complex in the plasma membrane  <cit> . this pathway was shown to be responsible for iron uptake not only from iron salts but also from iron loaded host proteins such as transferrin and ferritin  <cit> . deletion of ftr <dig> rendered c. albicans completely avirulent in a mouse model and abolished the damage of oral epithelial cells  <cit> . reduction of ferric iron to ferrous iron by reductases increases the solubility and availability of iron. however, the function of mcfos leading to the reoxidation of fe2+ is not as well understood. complex formation with the permease and channeling of fe3+ could maintain the availability of iron and deliver iron in the oxidized and less reactive form to the cytosol.

due to the toxic potential of iron by generating reactive oxygen species   <cit> , cellular iron homeostasis is subjected to tight regulation. in c. albicans, the transcriptional regulators sfu1p, hap43p and sef1p are part of an iron responsive regulatory network  <cit> . sfu1p is a gata-type repressor, which is active under high iron conditions. it negatively regulates genes encoding for ferric reductases, mcfos, iron permeases, as well as hap43p, the regulatory element of the ccaat-binding complex   <cit> . hap43p is a transcription factor that is activated under low iron conditions and represses the expression of sfu1p and of iron utilization genes so that repression of genes involved in iron uptake is relieved and the limited amount of iron is efficiently used for vital proteins  <cit> . sef1p was identified as a transcriptional activator of iron uptake genes  <cit> . it is repressed by sfu1p, but activated under low iron conditions. it induces hap43p and iron uptake genes, such as fet <dig> , as well as a copper-transporting atpase encoding gene  required for mcfo activity  <cit> . additionally, other transcription factors, such as tup1p and rim101p, are involved in the regulation of iron uptake genes, but their roles are not as obvious. tup1p is a global repressor which may be recruited to iron responsive genes via interaction with sfu1p  <cit> , while regulation by rim101p is influenced by ph  <cit> .

this complex regulation of iron uptake probably helps c. albicans to successfully adapt to niches with different iron levels  <cit> . however, even though transcriptional regulators of the iron response network were identified, signaling pathways, which govern the activity of these regulators, are less well known.

four iron uptake genes, namely the ferric reductase fre <dig>  the hemoglobin receptor rbt <dig>  the high affinity iron permease ftr <dig> and the mcfo fet <dig>  were found to be de-repressed in cells lacking hog <dig> under sufficient iron conditions, which are usually repressive for these genes  <cit> . hog1p encodes the mitogen activated protein kinase  orthologous to human p <dig>  <cit>  and to stress – activated protein kinases  in other yeasts  <cit> . in response to several environmental stresses, hog1p becomes phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus  <cit> . hog <dig> null mutants were found to be hypersensitive to those stress conditions, which lead to hog1p activation, in particular to extracellular oxidizing agents  <cit> . at least the response to oxidative and osmotic stress depends on the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase pbs2p  <cit> . among the substrates of hog1p are transcription factors  <cit>  so that activation of hog1p also modulates gene expression profiles  <cit> .

as until now no further details are known on the regulatory role of hog1p in the response of c. albicans to iron availability, we investigated phenotypic and molecular responses of c. albicans to extracellular iron levels. we observed flocculation of wild type  cells with increasing iron concentrations. this phenotype was dependent on both protein synthesis and an intact hog pathway as it was abolished in the Δhog <dig> and the Δpbs <dig> mutants. moreover, deletion of hog <dig> led to the de-repression of mcfos as wells as to increased ferric reductase activity under sufficient iron conditions. however, cultivation of the Δhog <dig> mutant in restricted iron medium enhanced the expression even further. reactive oxygen species  were accumulated under excessive iron conditions in the wt as well as in the Δhog <dig> mutant thus indicating iron uptake by both strains. moreover, in the wt we observed transient phosphorylation of hog1p under high iron conditions.

RESULTS
iron induced c. albicans flocculation in a concentration dependent manner
during cultivation of c. albicans sc <dig> wild type  in rpmi containing different fecl <dig> concentrations  at 30°c, we observed flocculation of cells in an iron concentration dependent manner . flocs of cells could be seen at  <dig> μm and visibly increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> μm fe3+. flocculation was induced when  <dig> μm feso <dig> were used as sole iron source instead of fecl <dig>  however, flocculation in response to feso <dig> was less pronounced at that iron concentration compared to  <dig> μm fecl <dig> as quantified by measuring sedimentation rates  as previously described  <cit> .

flocculation was also induced in yeast nitrogen base  medium containing  <dig> μm fecl <dig> compared to  <dig>  μm basal fe3+ concentration , thus showing that the induction of flocculation was independent from the medium used .

cells may possess internal iron stores from pre-cultivation in an iron sufficient medium. thus, we investigated whether the iron content of the medium used during pre-cultivations influenced the dependence of the flocculent phenotype on the iron concentration in rpmi.

c. albicans was either pre-cultivated in a medium with sufficient iron, i.e. the rich yeast extract-peptone-dextrose  medium, or starved for iron by pre-cultivation in a medium with restricted iron availability . rim resulted from addition of the iron chelator bathophenanthroline disulfonate  to ypd medium. as shown in figure 1c, flocculation due to exposure to  <dig> μm fe3+ was independent on the pre-cultivation medium: wt cells starved for iron by pre-cultivation in rim flocculated upon exposure to  <dig> μm fe3+ with a similar sedimentation rate as cells pre-cultivated in ypd. during all later experiments, we pre-cultivated c. albicans in ypd and added  <dig> μm fecl <dig> as iron source to the respective medium of the working culture unless it is mentioned otherwise.

interactions between cells leading to flocculation occur via constituents of the cell wall, which favor physical  or specific biochemical interactions. the cell wall of c. albicans comprises proteins which are frequently mannosylated and attached to the backbone of the cell wall formed by glucans and chitin  <cit> . to obtain further information about the flocculent phenotype, protein biosynthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide   <dig> min prior to iron addition. a reduction in flocculation was observed after iron addition compared to an equally treated methanol control . thus, protein synthesis seemed to be required for induction of iron dependent flocculation.

high extracellular iron levels led to accumulation of intracellular ros
iron is a potent inducer of reactive oxygen species  under aerobic conditions. ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron by superoxide formed as byproduct of respiration. the resulting ferrous iron is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to the extremely reactive hydroxyl radical. thus, uptake of iron leads to the accumulation of toxic ros and, correspondingly, accumulation of ros can be used as indicator of iron uptake, if all other conditions are kept constant. ros levels were determined using  <dig> ′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate  which is a cell permeable, oxidant sensitive agent widely used for intracellular ros determination  <cit> . compared to a water control, exposure of cells to  <dig> μm  but not to  <dig> μm  iron led to an increase in ros generation by  <dig> - 40%. this effect could be reversed by the ros scavenger n-acetyl cysteine , when added to the cells together with iron .

flocculation is frequently induced in yeasts as a response to stress  <cit> . as we had observed that high iron levels  induced both flocculation as well as ros accumulation while  <dig> μm fe3+ did not, we investigated whether a relationship exists between the flocculation phenotype and iron induced oxidative stress. we determined the sedimentation rates of cells exposed to  <dig> μm iron and of cells exposed to the same iron concentration together with nac. however, nac did not prevent iron induced flocculation and the same sedimentation rates were obtained from both samples . thus, iron induced flocculation and ros accumulation were not related to each other.

mcfo expression was induced by low iron levels
the expression of genes involved in iron uptake is regulated by iron availability. haiu genes are induced under restricted iron conditions and repressed under high iron concentrations  <cit> . as mentioned above, members of the corresponding protein families are present in the plasma membrane of c. albicans. heating whole microbial cells resuspended in phosphate buffers to elevated temperatures was already described as a method for the extraction of proteins associated with the cell wall or with the plasma membrane of different microorganisms  <cit> . we applied a similar approach by briefly boiling c. albicans cells grown in ypd medium or rim. proteins involved in haiu were expected to be more abundant in cells cultivated in rim compared to ypd. extracted proteins were separated by sds page and visualized by coomassie staining. a protein band , which was significantly accumulated in rim , was analyzed by maldi-tof ms, ms/ms and n-terminal edman degradation for identification. n-terminal sequencing of the protein extracted from the respective gel band resulted in the identification of the amino acid sequence kthtxyyktgxvnan  which corresponds to the n-terminal sequence of the mcfo fet3p  after cleavage of a predicted  <dig> amino acid signal peptide . in the genome of c. albicans, five mcfo encoding genes are present. these are fet <dig> , fet <dig> , fet <dig> , fet <dig>  and fet <dig> . the k <dig> residue is unique for fet3p among c. albicans mcfos . additionally, a glutamic acid peak appeared at residue  <dig>  but was less intense than the lysine peak. this is indicative for the mcfos fet31p, fet34p and fet99p . maldi-tof ms-analysis led to the identification of three peptide peaks specific for fet34p and two peaks specific for fet3p in addition to one peak shared between fet34p and fet3p, another peak shared between fet3p, fet31p and one peak shared between fet3p, fet31p and fet99p . ms-ms analysis of the peak appearing at  <dig>  m/z unequivocally confirmed the presence of fet34p in the excised band. taken together, these data indicated the presence of at least fet3p and fet34p in the protein extract. however, presence of fet31p and fet99p is also possible and could neither be confirmed nor excluded. in general, all c. albicans mcfos apart from fet33p, are highly conserved among each other as fet31p, fet34p and fet99p have an amino acid sequence identity ranging between  <dig> – 83% compared to fet3p  <cit> .

previous gene expression experiments in c. albicans had reported that fet <dig> expression was regulated by iron availability, as expression of this gene was induced under restricted iron compared to sufficient iron conditions  <cit> . thus, we further investigated the dependence of mcfos expression on iron concentrations in the growth medium. according to information given by the supplier, rpmi medium does not contain iron salts and can be considered as medium with very low basal iron levels. thus, the concentrations of fecl <dig> added to this medium were taken as total fe3+ concentration. increasing ferric iron concentrations led to significant decreases of mcfos levels as determined by sds page and subsequent coomassie staining of proteins . when iron concentrations equaled or exceeded  <dig>  μm, hardly any protein band was visible. taken together, these results confirm that the expression levels of extracted mcfos were dependent on the iron ion concentration in the growth medium.

deletion of hog <dig> induced components of the haiu pathway independent of iron availability
previously, de-repression of genes involved in iron uptake  was reported in the Δhog <dig> mutant by whole genome gene expression profiling of cells grown under sufficient iron conditions  <cit> . as the expression of these genes is usually repressed by sufficient iron conditions and only induced by restricted iron conditions  <cit>  , we investigated the function of hog1p in the response of c. albicans to iron. we first confirmed elevated amounts of mcfo proteins in Δhog <dig> and Δpbs <dig> deletion mutants in comparison to the wild type  and the reference strain  which was best seen in cells grown in ypd overnight . the identity of the mcfo proteins was proven by ms/ms analysis of the peptide at  <dig>  m/z . increased amounts of mcfos were observed in two different, independently constructed Δhog <dig> and Δpbs <dig> mutants . as proteins, which are usually used as gel loading controls, are cytosolic proteins and not present in the cell wall, we had added bsa to the extracted proteins to demonstrate that all lanes were loaded with the same total amount of protein. fortunately, all bands in the gels showed an additional c. albicans protein band at molecular weights below  <dig> kda, which had the same intensity in all samples so that it could be used as indicator of the amount of extracted protein . in rpmi the intensity of this band usually was slightly lower than the intensity of the mcfo band . after a cultivation time of 5h in ypd the mcfo band had an intensity of approximately 50% of this control band .

as fre <dig>  the major ferric reductase of c. albicans <cit> , was also reported to be de-repressed in the Δhog <dig> mutant   <cit> , we determined cell surface ferric reductase activity of whole yeast cells using a previously published protocol  <cit> . as shown in figure 4b, ferric reductase activities increased when the wild type  and the reference strain  were cultivated in rim compared to ypd. this further highlights the induction of this class of proteins by low iron levels. moreover, cell surface ferric reductase activity was increased in Δhog <dig> mutants compared to both sc <dig> and day <dig> when cultivated in ypd , showing that de-repression of these enzymes in Δhog <dig> mutants led to higher enzyme activities. however, the response of haiu components to low iron concentrations was not completely eliminated in the Δhog <dig> mutants, as we still observed induction of mcfos expression  as well as increased ferric reductase activity when the Δhog <dig> mutant was cultivated in rim . thus deletion of hog <dig> led to both increased mcfos expression as well as increased cell surface reductase activity, and both were further increased by iron restriction.

c. albicans flocculation in response to high iron concentrations was dependent on both hog1p and pbs2p kinases
we had observed that high iron concentrations induced a flocculent phenotype in wt cells . thus, we investigated whether this phenotype was also dependent on the kinases hog1p and pbs2p. interestingly, microscopic analysis and cell sedimentation assays showed that flocculation was absent in both Δhog <dig> and Δpbs <dig> mutants after exposure to high fe3+, while still induced in the reference strain day <dig> . when hog <dig> was re-integrated as fusion protein with gfp , flocculation was restored after exposure to high iron concentrations as shown by measuring cell sedimentation rates . thus, the induction of flocculation was dependent on hog <dig> and pbs <dig>  moreover, we observed flocculation of Δhog <dig>  when 10% human plasma was added to the medium . thus, Δhog <dig> cells are generally still able to aggregate. both observations indicate that hog1p is specifically required for this iron-induced flocculent phenotype. the requirement of protein synthesis for flocculation was confirmed for the reference strain day <dig> .

to ensure that iron was taken up by Δhog <dig> and Δpbs <dig> cells, we determined fe3+ levels in culture supernatants of the reference strain day <dig> and the deletion mutants Δhog <dig> and Δpbs <dig> after an incubation time of  <dig> min. all three strains removed iron with the same efficiency from the growth medium . moreover, we observed increased intracellular ros generation in Δhog <dig> cells after incubation with  <dig> μm fecl <dig> , indicating intracellular activity of iron and thus iron uptake by those cells. in agreement with previous reports  <cit> , we observed higher basal ros production in Δhog <dig> cells compared to day <dig> cells.

starting fe3+ concentrations of  <dig> μm were set as 100%.

hog1p was activated by high iron concentrations
as loss of hog <dig> influenced the response of c. albicans to elevated iron concentrations we determined the phosphorylation  state of hog1p after exposure to high fe3+ concentrations. as shown in figure 6a, we observed significant hyper-phosphorylation of hog1p when the wild type strain sc <dig> was exposed to  <dig> μm fe3+. however, hog1p hyper-phosphorylation was only transient, as maximum phosphorylation was obtained only from  <dig>  -  <dig> min after exposure to high fe3+ . results were similar, when the reference strain day <dig> was used . hog1p phosphorylation was almost as strong after exposure to high fe3+ concentrations as after exposure to sorbitol  . but hog1p was dephosphorylated already  <dig> min after the exposure to iron .

hog1p was required for maintenance of c. albicans viability under high iron conditions
since hog1p appeared to be involved in the response of c. albicans to high iron concentrations, we investigated whether hog1p could have any protecting effect on c. albicans against deleterious effects of exposure to high iron levels. thus, we determined the viability of cells after exposure to  <dig> μm fe3+ using the alamarblue® assay, which is an indicator of the metabolic activity of cells  <cit> . this fluorescence assay has been widely used to determine viability of different yeasts including c. albicans <cit> . we observed that basal fluorescence signals were always higher for Δhog <dig> cells than for the reference strain day <dig> . this could be due to the intrinsically enhanced mitochondrial activity of hog <dig> deficient cells  <cit> .

cells were exposed to  <dig> μm fecl <dig> in rpmi and incubated at 30°c for  <dig> min. a decrease of the reduction rate of alamarblue®, i.e. of the viability, was observed for all tested strains. however, exposure to high iron levels led to a higher decrease of the signals obtained from the Δhog <dig> mutant  compared to the reference strain   and the wild type  . these data indicate that the Δhog <dig> mutant was less resistant to high iron levels than the wt cells. however, after  <dig> days no apparent growth defects were observed when the strains sc <dig> , day <dig> , Δhog <dig> and Δpbs <dig> were grown on rpmi agar supplemented with  <dig> μm fecl <dig> compared to cells grown on the same medium containing  <dig> or  <dig> μm fecl <dig>  respectively . this would indicate that the reduced metabolic activity of the Δhog <dig> mutant under high iron conditions did not affect growth of c. albicans on the long term.

the lower reduction rate of alamarblue® after exposure of Δhog <dig> to high fe3+ concentrations was probably not due to the more oxidized intracellular environment after exposure of Δhog <dig> cells to high iron concentrations, as Δhog <dig> cells had a higher basal ros level than wt cells, but the basal alamarblue® signals were also higher. thus, the intracellular oxidation state  did not directly correlate with alamarblue® signals.

discussion
previous studies on Δhog <dig> mutants from c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans showed that deletion of hog <dig> led to the de-repression of several genes known to be upregulated under restricted iron conditions  <cit> . in c. albicans, this group of genes included rbt <dig>  fre <dig>  ftr <dig>  fet <dig>  orf <dig> , pmh <dig>  ecm <dig>  cat <dig>  ddr <dig>  yor <dig> and hsp <dig> <cit> .

whether this phenotype was due to a direct involvement of hog1p in the regulation of the iron responsive network or due to indirect effects, such as perturbations of copper metabolism, which may have impaired the functionality of iron uptake proteins was not yet studied.

as expected, high levels of extracellular iron increased the formation of intracellular ros. thus, we used intracellular ros levels together with the removal of iron from growth medium as indicators of iron entry into the cells. we detected increased basal ros levels in the Δhog <dig> mutants, as previously reported  <cit> . these ros levels were further increased by exposure to  <dig> μm fe3+ confirming that iron was taken up by Δhog <dig> cells. moreover, iron ions were removed from the growth medium with the same efficiency by Δhog <dig> as by the reference  cells. thus, hog1p dependent phenotypes of the c. albicans response to iron were not due to iron uptake deficiencies, but could be rather due to the involvement of hog1p in the response to iron availability. this is supported by our data on the transient hyper-phosphorylation of hog1p during exposure of cells to high iron concentrations.

elevated iron concentrations induced a flocculent phenotype of c. albicans, which was dependent on the presence of both hog1p and pbs2p, as well as on protein synthesis. as high iron concentrations led to increased phosphorylation of hog1p, this could induce the synthesis of proteins of which some mediate cell aggregation. this iron triggered activation of hog1p is likely not related to oxidative stress, as the potent radical scavenger nac did not prevent the flocculent phenotype upon exposure to high iron concentrations, while it decreased intracellular ros levels. for the closely related yeast s. cerevisiae, a function of schog1p in cell aggregation was reported, in that hyperactive schog1p mutants resulted in increased flocculation  <cit> .

first hints on an involvement of hog1p in the response of c. albicans to iron came from the observation of the de-repression of several iron uptake genes in the Δhog <dig> mutant under otherwise repressive conditions  <cit> . in agreement with these gene expression data, we observed increased mcfos protein levels and ferric reductase activity in Δhog <dig> mutants. furthermore we found that mcfos were also de-repressed in Δpbs <dig> mutants, indicating that the hog <dig> mediated regulation of mcfos was dependent on pbs <dig>  remarkably, induction of these components in rim was not strictly dependent on hog1p, as this induction was also observed in the Δhog <dig> mutant. thus deletion of hog <dig> de-repressed components of the iron uptake system, and this elevated basal level was further enhanced when iron availability was limited.

hog1p was shown to be essential for c. albicans under oxidative stress conditions  <cit> . our data indicated that the absence of hog <dig> reduced the metabolic activity of the cells after exposure to high iron concentrations compared to wild type cells. taking in account that exposure of Δhog <dig> cells to high iron concentrations further increased the comparably high basal intracellular ros levels in the mutant, the decreased viability of the Δhog <dig> mutant under such conditions could be due to elevated oxidative stress. however, other mechanisms independent from hog1p were also described for the initiation of oxidative stress responses  <cit> . these mechanisms could allow also the mutant strains to adapt to the stress conditions so that the reduced viability was observed only as immediate response and did not lead to significant growth defects.

it has yet to be elucidated which elements downstream of hog1p provide the link between the hog pathway and factors which regulate reductive iron uptake. as many hog1p repressed genes, including those involved in iron uptake , were also found to be repressed by tup1p  <cit> , a role for this global co-repressor downstream of hog1p could be assumed. indeed, a role of tup1p in regulating iron uptake has been reported  <cit> . however, the details remain to be elucidated.

in this study, we used several single gene deletion mutants which were generated by different approaches  <cit> . all mutant strains were descendants of the strain cai- <dig>  <cit> , in which both copies of iro <dig> are deleted. additionally, all strains ectopically express ura <dig> 

iro <dig> is a gene that encodes a transcription factor with a potential role in iron utilization. expression of iro <dig> in a Δaft <dig> s. cerevisiae strain restored growth in iron depleted media. however, a role of iro <dig> in c. albicans iron metabolism is not confirmed  <cit> . on the other hand, ectopic expression of ura <dig> has been shown to affect several features of c. albicans, such as hyphal morphology, adhesion, virulence and cellular proteome in addition to ura3p activity  <cit> .

in all of our experiments, the day <dig> reference strain behaved similar to the wt sc <dig>  additionally, cnc <dig> and jmr <dig>  as well as brd <dig> and jjh <dig>  showed similar features. thus, no effects of the ectopic expression of ura <dig> or the absence of iro <dig> were observed.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here for the first time in fungi, that the conserved stress activated map kinase hog1p of c. albicans is involved in the response to changes in extracellular iron levels. previous studies had only shown that deletion of hog <dig> led to the de-repression of haiu components in this fungus under otherwise repressive conditions. we found that repression of haiu components of the reductive pathway by hog1p occurs independently of environmental iron availability. exposure of c. albicans to high iron concentrations renders hog1p hyper-phosphorylated. thus, our results suggest that hog1p has a dual role in c. albicans iron homeostasis. on the one hand basal hog1p activity permanently reduces expression of haiu components and on the other hand hyper-activity of hog1p leads to the activation of a specific response towards high iron concentrations.
