BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori may have infected humans since their origin and currently is believed to infect more than half the population in the world  <cit> . infection is usually acquired during childhood by intrafamilial transmission and in the majority of cases infection is lifelong unless eradication by antibiotic treatment is undertaken  <cit> . the prevalence of h. pylori infection ranges from 25% in developed countries to more than 80% in the developing regions  <cit> . h. pylori is commonly transmitted from mother to child  <cit> .

h. pylori is well known for being highly diverse and recombining frequently. dna sequence analysis of housekeeping and virulence associated genes all have illustrated the unusually high degree of genetic variability in this species  <cit> . comparison of isolates within a single host sampled over an average of  <dig>  years has revealed that an average of ~ <dig> dna imports occur between bacteria, corresponding to 3% of the genome or  <dig> kb  <cit>  and by extrapolation from these data, it was predicted that within  <dig> years half the genome would have been replaced by imports  <cit> . in comparison, 10– <dig> million years were needed to replace 60% of the e. coli genome  <cit> .

studies suggest that recombination is rare between isolates from different continents and as such h. pylori behaves like a genetic marker of human descent and reflects the human population in which the host spent his/her childhood  <cit> . multilocus sequence typing  of seven housekeeping genes from several hundred h. pylori strains isolated from different geographical, ethnic, and/or linguistic origins showed that h. pylori followed human migration out of africa and identified six h. pylori populations which are designated as hpafrica <dig>  hpafrica <dig>  hpneafrica, hpeurope, hpeastasia, and hpasia <dig>  <cit> . three of these populations are further divided into subpopulations: hpeastasia is divided into three subpopulations, hspeasia, hspamerind and hspmaori. the hspmaori subpopulation has been isolated exclusively from maoris and other polynesians and the hspamerind from inuits and amerinds in north and south america; hpafrica <dig> is divided into hspsafrica and hspwafrica; hpeurope is divided into ancestral european  <dig>  and ancestral european  <dig> .

countries with populations of multiple origins provide a good opportunity to further study the population structure of h. pylori. malaysia is composed of three major ethnic populations: malay , chinese  and indian  http://www.statistics.gov.my. the majority of malaysian chinese migrated from southern china, the malaysian indians from southern india and the malays are in general considered natives of malaysia  <cit> . the malaysian malay population is made up of a mixture of people extant in south east asia as early as  <dig> years ago  <cit> . however, in modern malaysia they are now referred to as the malays  <cit> . the aboriginal orang asli people in malaysia do not share the same origin as the malays  <cit> .

h. pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of developing peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer  <cit>  as well as an increased risk of developing primary non-hodgkin's lymphomas of the stomach   <cit> . previous studies have shown that the indian ethnic group has the highest rate of h. pylori infection , followed by the chinese  and the malay the lowest   <cit> . this difference of prevalence was also found in children  <cit> . interestingly the three populations have different rates of gastric cancer. while the malaysian chinese population has a high incidence the malaysian indian population has a low incidence  <cit> . the phenomenon of high prevalence of h. pylori but low incidence of gastric cancer has been dubbed the "indian enigma"  <cit> . a better understanding of the population structure of h. pylori in these ethnic populations is clearly needed to order to elucidate the differences in infection rates and disease severity. we used mlst to analyse h. pylori isolates obtained from the three ethnic groups in malaysia. we show the similarity between the malay and the indian h. pylori isolates and the diversity between the malaysian indian h. pylori population identified in this study and the indian ladakh h. pylori population identified by linz et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
nucleotide diversity of the housekeeping genes
fragments of seven housekeeping genes,atpa , efp , muty , ppa , trpc , urei , and yphc , with a total length of  <dig>  bp were sequenced from  <dig> malaysian h. pylori isolates, including  <dig> chinese,  <dig> malay and  <dig> indian isolates. mlst data of  <dig> isolates comprising of isolates from two studies by achtman's group  <cit>  available at the time of analysis were extracted from the h. pylori mlst database http://pubmlst.org/helicobacter/ and included in the analysis with data from this study. the level of nucleotide diversity between populations and between genes is shown in table  <dig>  the most diverse gene was trpc in all except the malaysian chinese population with the highest diversity at nearly  <dig> % while the least diverse gene was atpa at  <dig> %. the three ethnic populations showed different levels of diversity with the chinese population the lowest while the indian and malay populations were similar. all ethnic groups had lower level of variation than the global population as a whole.

structure analysis
to determine the relationship of the malaysian h. pylori isolates and the global isolates, we analysed our mlst data together with the global data using the bayesian statistics tool, structure  <cit> , which was previously used to divide global h. pylori isolates into six ancestral populations, designated as hpafrica <dig>  hpafrica <dig>  hpneafrica, hpeurope, hpeastasia and hpasia <dig>  <cit> . the malaysian h. pylori isolates were found to fall into four of the six known populations . twenty three indian and nine malay isolates were grouped with hpasia2;  <dig> chinese, four indian and two malay isolates grouped with hpeastasia; one chinese, eight indian and four malay isolates grouped with hpeurope; and one malay isolate grouped with hpafrica <dig> . phylogenetic analysis using the neighbour joining algorithm as shown in figure 1b divided the isolates into three clusters, consistent with the structure analysis.

since some populations can be further divided into subpopulations   <cit> , we used the same approach to further classify the malaysian isolates into subpopulations. for the malaysian isolates in the hpeastasia population, the majority  fell into hspeasia except for two isolates  falling into the hspmaori subpopulation. hpasia <dig> had previously no subpopulations. there were  <dig> isolates in hpasia <dig> including  <dig> isolates from this study and  <dig> ladakh isolates. our structure analysis divided these  <dig> isolates into two subpopulations . all  <dig> ladakh isolates were grouped as one subpopulation while the remaining  <dig> isolates including  <dig> malaysian indian and malay isolates from this study, one singapore isolate and three uk isolates  grouped together as another . therefore we named the two subpopulations as hspladakh and hspindia respectively. for the  <dig> malaysian isolates falling into hpeurope, three indian and three malay isolates belonged to ae <dig> while one chinese, five indian and one malay isolate belonged to ae <dig> 

identification of polymorphisms distinguishing the subpopulations
based on above structure analysis, we reasoned that there must be informative bases that support the division of the subpopulations. to identify these bases, we performed site-by-site pairwise comparisons between subpopulations using fisher's exact test at a significance level of  <dig>  with dunn-sidak correction for multiple site comparisons. we examined five subpopulations in four comparisons, hspladakh versus hspindia, hspeasia versus hspindia, hspeasia versus hspmaori, and hspeasia versus hspamerind subpopulations. out of the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> informative sites in the four pairwise comparisons,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sites respectively support the population divisions and we define these sites as population segregation sites  . the gene containing the most psss was trpc which was also the most variable gene while the gene carrying the fewest number of psss was ppa with zero or one site. the sites supporting one subpopulation division may not support another population division.

the patterns of the psss also provided further insight into recombination between populations. structure analysis showed that in all subpopulations there were isolates with genes from other populations but the analysis did not identify which gene contributes to the mosaic genetic background. as shown in figure  <dig> for hspindia and hspladakh comparison, the psss clearly showed the origin of some imported genes. some involved the whole gene while others only involved segments of a gene. many of these recombinational events must have occurred in the original population in india. the identification of the psss supports the results of structure analysis which showed  <dig>  to  <dig> % imports and for the first time allowed us to identify the ancient alleles or sites in the populations concerned. the total number of psss between populations also reflects the distance between them. the more distantly related populations carry more segregating sites.

isolates with identical alleles
h. pylori has been reported to be clonal only over a short period of time  <cit>  and thus identical alleles among isolates is expected to be rare when sampling a large population. interestingly, among the  <dig> malaysian isolates analysed,  <dig> isolates had one or more identical alleles to other isolates. two pairs of isolates, fd584i/fd589i, and fd419m/fd433m were identical in all seven genes; one pair of isolates, gc48i and fd566c, shared six identical genes; two pairs of isolates, fd539i and fd523i, and fd616i and fd540i share four identical genes; another two pairs of isolates, fd529c and fd519c, and fd556i and fd574i shared two identical genes and seven sets of isolates of 2– <dig> isolates shared one identical gene. most of the identical genes were shared among the same ethnic population. however, we did observe that some genes were shared by different ethnic populations, most of which share only one identical gene. an indian isolate  shared six identical genes with a chinese isolate  and another indian isolate  had an identical gene with three chinese isolates .

we extended our analysis to include the  <dig> global isolate data to screen for identical genes that were shared globally. fourteen pairs of isolates had all seven genes identical. there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> sets with at least two isolates in each set sharing exclusively  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> identical alleles respectively. in a small number of cases a single isolate shared a subset of alleles with isolates that had a higher number of identical alleles these isolates were excluded. isolates shared the most alleles in the efp gene and the least in urei and yphc.

discussion
population structure of h. pylori among malaysian populations
h. pylori has been shown to have migrated with its host out of africa  <cit>  and population differentiation is seen clearly in different regions of the world. however no studies have looked at recent h. pylori migration histories. malaysia has a history of human immigration divided into three major waves, the earliest human settlement by the orang asli people – the malay aborigines, the migration of current malays  <dig> years ago, and the mid-nineteenth century migration of chinese and indians. there is no data on h. pylori infection in the orang asli people, but good studies of the other three major ethnic populations are available  <cit> . the h. pylori infection rate and disease severity are different among the three ethnic populations. this population mixture in malaysia provided a good opportunity to determine the h. pylori population admixture and to enhance our understanding of differences in infection rate and disease severity. we have shown in this study that the isolates recovered from the malaysian h. pylori population belong to three of the known h. pylori ancestral populations, hpeastasia, hpasia <dig> and hpeurope. the h. pylori isolates from the chinese and indian individuals were divided along their ethnic origins. surprisingly the malay isolates did not have a separate origin which is discussed below. there were six indian isolates having chinese h. pylori ancestry but none the reverse.

the population divisions identified in the current study are supported by the distribution of the caga phosphorylation motif epiya  <cit>  and vaca alleles  <cit>  reported in these populations. the predominant epiya motif in the malaysian chinese population has been shown to be abd  while the predominant type in both the malaysian indian and the malay populations is abc with a frequency of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. for vaca, the predominant genotype has been reported to be s1a among the malaysian malay  and indian populations , and s1c among the malaysian chinese population   <cit> . data from these two genes confirm our observation that the malay h. pylori population is more similar to indian than to chinese population.

it has been suggested that the combined effect of high levels of recombination and diversity does not allow phylogenetic analysis of h. pylori isolates  <cit>  and also implies that one would not expect to find any identical alleles to be recovered from the population unless they are from related hosts. however for the first time, we uncovered isolates with identical alleles, ranging from one to seven alleles, within and between the three malaysian populations. the available patient medical information showed that these isolates were not from related hosts. we also found isolates with up to seven identical alleles present in the global mlst data, which was not described previously. the recovery of isolates with identical alleles indicates that the frequency of recombination may be lower and hence clones may be more stable than previously thought. we suggest that isolates with even one identical allele are likely to be related by decent rather than recent recombination involving that gene. thus it may be possible to determine relationships of isolates if more genes are sequenced.

the origin of malay h. pylori
the malay h. pylori population did not form a group of its own. the majority  belong to the same group as the indian isolates. clearly the malay isolates share the same origin as the indian isolates. this conclusion has a number of implications for the origin of the malay people and malay h. pylori. previous studies have shown that h. pylori follows the human route of migration and reflects human ancestry. however there is no evidence that ancestral malays migrated from india. currently there are two theories for the origins of malay  <cit> , one being of southeast asian origin, specifically sharing common ancestry with the thais, the laotians and the cambodians while the other of southern china origin through migration to taiwan, then outwards to the philippines, borneo, indonesia and malaysia. the latter theory is supported by language origins while the former is supported by genetic evidence  <cit> . neither supports malays sharing direct common ancestry with indians. therefore for the malay population, the ancestry of h. pylori does not reflect human ancestry as in other populations.

this raises the question as to what happened with the original malay h. pylori since the human population undoubtedly carried the bacterium before migrating out of africa. studies showed that the h. pylori infection rate in the malay population is much lower than that in the indian population  <cit> . it is therefore likely that the malay population was initially free of h. pylori and that the h. pylori in the current malay population has only recently been acquired from the malaysian indian community. it is possible that the malay population lost its original h. pylori  <cit> . however loss of h. pylori in modern populations is associated with improved living standards and this would be unlikely to be a plausible explanation for the initial loss of h. pylori in the malay population.

while the indian and chinese populations have a small percentage of isolates from populations other than their ancestral populations , the malay population has a much higher proportion of isolates  from populations other than hspindia . this adds support to the hypothesis that the malay population was initially free from h. pylori and that these isolates were directly imported from other populations recently. the higher proportion of malay isolates from the indian population than from the chinese population suggests that there has been greater direct interaction between the malay and indian populations than between the malay and chinese populations. reduced interaction between the malays and chinese may relate to factors such as incompatibility in food sources   <cit>  which may have partly constrained the transmission of h. pylori from the chinese to the malay population.

another potential source of h. pylori for non-aboriginal malays is the orang asli population, who originated from early human migration out of africa. the orang asli is likely to have taken the "southern route" into south east asia to reach malaysia by traveling along the indian ocean coast line 50– <dig>  years ago  <cit> . therefore the orang asli h. pylori, if it exists, may share common ancestry with the indian h. pylori, leading to the observed similarity of malay isolates to indian isolates. however given that other earlier h. pylori populations such as the maori and american indian populations can be readily identified  <cit> , one would expect that the orang asli h. pylori population would be unique and identifiable after such a long period of separation, arguing against acquisition from orang asli population and in favour of acquisition from the indian population.

flow of h. pylori genes/genotypes among the malaysian population and from other populations
apart from the malay population who appear to have gained the majority of its h. pylori isolates from the indian population as discussed above, there was also gene flow from other populations. in particular the indian and malay populations have higher levels of inflow of genes. thirteen of the  <dig>  malaysian indian/malay isolates were found grouped with the hpeurope population: six isolates grouped with ae <dig> and seven with ae <dig> . one malay isolate was found to be grouped with hpafrica <dig>  and one indian and one malay isolates grouped with hspmaori. the malaysian chinese population seems to have little inflow of genes from other populations with the exception of one chinese isolate which grouped with ae <dig>  the low frequency of chinese isolates with other population affinity indicates that this isolate was more likely to have been acquired by its current or most recent host directly from an ae <dig> h. pylori host.

in contrast, the indian/malay isolates with ancestral european history  are more likely to represent greater heterogeneity in the indian/malay h. pylori population and not direct transmission of isolates from the current european population or from early british or portuguese colonization as these strains have genes from the indian h. pylori gene pool. these isolates contain 8% to 40% hspindia genes based on structure analysis. by population segregation sites,  <dig> segments with at least two psss identical to the indian/malay population were identified . three isolates have one identical  allele . in contrast, the only chinese isolate  with a european ancestry showed almost no signal of indian or chinese ancestry. such a diversity of isolates in the malaysian population is interesting and warrants further studies.

$ denotes % genes allocated to the given population by structure analysis

there are two other possible sources of genetic heterogeneity in the indian h. pylori: century-old importation and earlier common ancestry. while the colonisation of india from as early as the fifteenth century by the portuguese and later by the british empire  <cit>  may have contributed directly to the indian h. pylori gene pool from the european population. this explanation does not reconcile well with the observation by wirth et al.  <cit>  that in the ladakh population genes of european ancestry were found despite the population being in a more pristine region. it has previously been suggested that ae <dig> originated in central asia because it shares phylogenetic signals with isolates from estonia, finland and ladakh  <cit> . since the ancestors of malaysian indians and the ladakhis resided in the same region and their h. pylori belong to hpasia <dig>  it seems likely that this biased share of the gene pool by the malaysian indian/malay isolates with the ae <dig> subpopulation is due to an earlier common ancestry. our findings are consistent with the studies of wirth et al.  <cit> , linz et al.  <cit>  and devi et al.  <cit>  that h. pylori in the indian population is more heterogeneous in origin, reflecting perhaps both earlier common ancestry and recent imports.

division of hpasia <dig> into subpopulations
the hpasia <dig> population was initially defined based on isolates from ladakh in northern india, which represents the west/middle asia population. since the malaysian indian population is known to have originated from india, the malaysian indian isolates were initially not expected to be distinguishable from the ladakh population. however, we have shown that the two populations can be divided within hpasia <dig> as subpopulations, hspladakh and hspindia . a total of  <dig>  segregating sites among the seven housekeeping genes were identified to separate the two subpopulations. there is however considerable gene flow between the two populations. identical alleles as defined by the psss can be treated as recombination that occurred in the more distant past. these alleles are present in three genes . further many segments with at least two identical psss are present in three other genes . note that ppa has no psss. these results suggest that there is considerable population admixture in the earlier history of the indian population. a recent study of the indian population sequenced  <dig> isolates by mlst but the sequences are shorter  <cit> . structure analysis of combined data from our malaysian indian isolates, ladakh isolates and these  <dig> indian isolates using k =  <dig> populations and found that the malaysian indian isolates grouped together with the indian isolates while the ladakh isolates were separate. however, when k =  <dig> populations were used, the two sets of indian isolates were separated . this suggests that the two indian populations overlap but are distinctive. the malaysian indian h. pylori population may have differentiated further from the indian h. pylori population from india, although it is also possible that the difference between the two h. pylori populations reflects regional differences in india as the malaysian indians mainly came from south india.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has shown that the malaysian h. pylori isolates can be differentiated into three populations using mlst, being hpeastasia, hpasia <dig> and hpeurope. interestingly the malay population was shown to carry h. pylori isolates of indian origin. the infection rate of h. pylori among the malay population is low in comparison to the malaysian indian population  <cit> . in western countries a low or reduced rate of h. pylori infection is attributed to high or improved hygiene standard  <cit> . however this factor does not account for differences between the malay and the other two populations  <cit> . therefore the malay population was likely to be initially h. pylori-free and has acquired h. pylori only recently from the indian population. thus the low h. pylori infection rate in the malay population may be due to low cross infection rate from another population.

the malaysian indian/malay isolates were found to differ from the ladakh isolates from india and in fact formed a new subpopulation, hspindia. clearly there are more subpopulations of h. pylori and populations can be divided at a finer scale when more isolates are used or more geographical regions are sampled. more extensive worldwide surveys will help us further understand the evolution and population structure of h. pylori, an organism that has impacted more than half of the world's population and continues to pose great risk to human health because of its association with gastric cancer and malt lymphoma. genetic heterogeneity of the bacterium within a host population as shown in this study should be taken into account when studying the epidemiology and pathogenesis of h. pylori since there is clearly variation in incidence and severity of the disease in different populations.
