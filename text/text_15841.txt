BACKGROUND
starch is the major storage carbohydrate in the seeds of cereal crops. starch comprises approximately 90% and 65–75% of the dry weight of rice and wheat, respectively  <cit> . starch consists of the glucose polymers amylose and amylopectin. amylose is a relatively linear molecule consisting of -linked units of d-glucopyranosyl, whereas amylopectin mainly consists of long chains of -linked d-glucopyranosyl units with occasional branching  linkages that yield tandem linked clusters   <cit> . in the current model of the multiple-cluster structure of amylopectin, a-chains are linked to other chains at their reducing ends, whereas b-chains carry  <dig> or more chains belonging to a cluster. b1-chains are present within single clusters, whereas b2- and b3-chains are long chains interconnecting many clusters. the only chain that contains a reducing terminal in an amylopectin molecule is called a c-chain  <cit> . amylopectins from different species exhibit different chain length distributions with periodic occurrence of varying degrees of polymerization . these chains are grouped into four fractions with dp in intervals 6– <dig> , 13– <dig> , 25– <dig> , and > <dig>   <cit> .

the endosperm of mature wheat  contains three types of starch granules: a, b, and c. a-granules, from  <dig> to 50 μm in diameter, constitute up to 70% of the volume and 10% of the total number of starch granules  <cit> . in contrast, b-granules, 5–9 μm in diameter, constitute approximately 30% of the volume and 90% of the total number of granules. recent evidence indicates the presence of c-granules with a diameter less than 5 μm; their small size makes them difficult to isolate and quantify, which commonly leads to them being classified with b-granules  <cit> . in wheat, b-granules negatively affect flour processing and bread quality  <cit> , but positively affect pasta production  <cit> . this is thought to be due, at least in part, to the swelling capacity of b-granules: they bind more water than a-granules do  <cit> . the a- and b-granules in the triticeae endosperm are separated in time and space. a-granules are formed approximately 4– <dig> days post-anthesis  when the endosperm is still actively dividing  <cit> . b-granules appear approximately 10– <dig> dpa, whereas the small c-granules first appear ~ <dig> dpa  <cit> . the genetic basis of the multimodal size distribution of starch in wheat and barley is of great interest because the physiochemical properties of each type of granule vary and contribute to the food and industrial end uses of triticeae starch .

amylose synthesis is controlled by granule-bound starch synthase   <cit> . amylopectins are synthesized by concerted reactions catalyzed by four enzyme classes: adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase , starch synthase , starch-branching enzyme , and starch-debranching enzyme . agpase catalyzes the first reaction in starch synthesis, producing the activated glucosyl donor adp-glucose. starch synthases catalyze transfer of glucose units from adp-glucose onto the non-reducing end of a glucan chain to synthesize water-insoluble glucan polymers  <cit> . in cereal species, starch synthases are subdivided into granule-bound starch synthase  and ss, responsible for amylopectin synthesis. gbss is the only ss found exclusively within the starch granule and responsible for amylose synthesis  <cit> . the ss group consists of four isoforms designated ss-i, ss-ii, ss-iii, and ss-iv, which are localized predominantly at the granule surface  <cit> . genetic analyses of arabidopsis and rice suggest ss-i is required for the elongation of short a-chains within amylopectin  <cit> . the function of ss-ii is the elongation amylopectin chains of dp 6– <dig> to produce intermediate-length chains of dp 12– <dig>  <cit> . analysis of ss-iii mutants suggests this enzyme class catalyzes the synthesis of long amylopectin chains, dp 25– <dig>  or greater . although little is known about the role of ss-iv in starch synthesis, recent research in arabidopsis showed that it may function to control granule number  <cit> . starch-branching enzyme isoforms sbei and sbeii generate α  linkages that form the branched structure of amylopectin. sbei plays an important but not exclusive role in the synthesis of b1-, b2-, and b3-chains. the sbeii-a and sbeii-b genes also perform a distinct function in the formation of a-chains . two groups of dbes exist in plants: isoamylase type and pullulanase type , which efficiently hydrolyze  α--linkages in amylopectin and pullulan , respectively, and belong to the α-amylase superfamily. one of the starch debranching enzymes, isoamylase , is an essential player in the formation of crystalline amylopectin  <cit> . pullulanase can supplement the function of isoamylase to some extent.

the genome sequence of brachypodium distachyon l. was completed in 2010; analysis suggests brachypodium is much more closely related to wheat and barley than to rice, sorghum, or maize  <cit> . in-depth studies of starch are necessary and significant because starch is a major storage carbohydrate in the seeds of cereal crops. until now, considerable research has focused on various characteristics of brachypodium, but the properties and development of starch granules remains poorly studied. we performed a comprehensive survey of the dynamic development of starch granules and regulation of starch synthesis in brachypodium through comparative analysis with triticum and aegilops. we also studied the phosphorylation status of gbssi, which controls amylase synthesis. our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of starch granule development and starch biosynthesis.

RESULTS
development of grains and starch granules in brachypodium
the morphological features and dynamic changes in developing grains during  <dig> stages after flowering in bd <dig>  chinese spring , and ae. peregrina are shown in additional file  <dig>  in all three genera, grain size and weight gradually increased from flowering to maturity, but some developmental differences were apparent. the grains were rapidly elongated from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa in bd <dig> and from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa in cs and ae. peregrina; at subsequent developmental stages, grain length increased slightly, while grain width and weight gradually increased until maturity . bd <dig> grain weight increased slightly throughout development, but increased rapidly from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa in cs and ae. peregrina. at  <dig> dpa, the grain weight reached the highest value .

the dynamic accumulation patterns of starch granules in the grain endosperm and pericarp during grain development were examined by light microcopy and sem. in this study, plenty of starch appeared in the pericarp at the beginning of the seed formation. as shown in additional file  <dig>  there was a thick pericarp layer with abundance of starch at  <dig> dpa that persisted through  <dig> dpa. colored starch grains were observed throughout the stages of grain development . in bd <dig>  the starch granules appeared ~ <dig> dpa; their diameter remained less than 10 μm throughout growth and were thus classified as b-granules . the starch granules in cs grew rapidly from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa but remained less than 10 μm in diameter; growth slowed from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa and yielded granules of diameter greater than 10 μm; these were classified as a-granules.figure  <dig>

the b-granule, whose diameter was less than 10 μm, appeared at  <dig> dpa. these  <dig> kinds of starch granules gradually increased during the subsequent period with the average diameter of a-granules stabilized at 20–30 μm and the diameter of b-granules at approximately 4–6 μm. the average granule diameter reached 10 μm by  <dig> or  <dig> dpa in ae. peregrina; these were classified as a-granules . sem of the variation in starch shape during grain development confirmed these results .figure  <dig>

in order to confirm that there are only a-granules in ae. peregrina and b-granules in bd <dig>  we purified all the granules from bd <dig> and ae. peregrina, and a-granules and b-granules from cs . statistical analysis showed that granule diameter in bd <dig> ranged from 4–6 μm, similar to the b-granules of cs , whereas the diameter of starch granules in ae. peregrina ranged from 20–30 μm, similar to the a-granules of cs .figure  <dig>

chromosomal localization, domain conservation, and phylogenetic analysis of starch synthesis-related genes in brachypodium
to identify the key genes regulating starch biosynthesis, the consensus amino acid sequences previously annotated in rice, wheat, and maize were used to perform a blast search against the whole brachypodium genome database . twenty-four nonredundant enzymes related to starch synthesis were identified. their distribution on the five brachypodium chromosomes and their domain structures are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the starch synthesis-related enzymes were distributed among five chromosomal regions, seven of which  were located on chromosome  <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  mb, four genes  on chromosome  <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  mb, six genes  on chromosome  <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  mb, three genes  on chromosome  <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  mb, and four genes  on chromosome  <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  mb .

as shown in additional file  <dig>  starch synthases including gbssi, gbssii, ssi, ssii-a, ssii-b, ssii-c, ssiii-a, ssiii-b, and ssiv-b, are mainly composed of two structural domains: the starch synthase catalytic domain and the glycosyl transferase domain. ssiii-a and ssiii-b have a redundant carbohydrate-binding domain at the n terminus. sbes and dbes  shared greater similarity, and all had the carbohydrate-binding module and an α-amylase catalytic domain, but the sbes contained one more α-amylase c-terminal all-β domain at the c terminus. pul is comprised of a carbohydrate-binding domain, α-amylase catalytic domain, and a domain with an unknown function. adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase small subunit  had only one nucleotidyl transferase domain, whereas the adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit  contained a ribosomal protein l <dig> n-terminal domain and a ribosomal protein l <dig> rna-binding domain .

in order to understand the relationships among the  <dig> genes associated with starch synthesis in brachypodium, rice, wheat, and maize, we constructed a phylogenetic tree . the genes were clearly separated into two groups: group i included sss and sbes, whereas group ii consisted of dbes and agpases. some key genes for starch synthesis were selected to construct different phylogenetic trees, including gbssi, ssi, sbei, sbeii-a, isai, pul, and agpl . although the genes related to starch synthesis from brachypodium, rice, wheat, and maize showed high similarity, most genes from brachypodium were closer to those of wheat than rice and maize.

dynamic expression profiles of starch synthesis-related genes during grain development
the dynamic expression profiles of  <dig> main starch synthesis-related genes during  <dig> grain developmental stages in brachypodium bd <dig> as well as common wheat  and ae. peregrina were analyzed by qrt-pcr  and melt curve analysis. although the genes showed some similarities, their expression patterns were distinct during grain development in each of the studied genera. we observed six expression patterns: type i , type ii , type iii , type iv , type v , and type vi  .figure  <dig>

starch is composed of glucose polymers amylose and amylopectin. gbssi, controlling amylose synthesis, displayed the down-up expression pattern  in bd <dig> and exhibited higher early expression  and weaker expression at later stages . in contrast, gbssi exhibited an up-down expression trend  and was mainly expressed at the intermediate stages of growth in wheat and ae. peregrina . amylopectin synthesis is mainly controlled by sss, sbes, and sdes. two expression patterns  were exhibited in bd21: the starch synthase  and starch branching enzyme  mainly exhibited a type iii expression pattern, whereas starch branching enzymes isai, isaii, isaiii, and pul displayed a type i expression pattern . for example, ssii-a and ssiii-a showed a down-up-down expression trend  in bd <dig>  and was strongly expressed at  <dig> dpa and 18– <dig> dpa, and then moderately expressed during grain filling , but minimally expressed at  <dig> dpa . isa i and pul exhibited a down-up pattern  in bd21: expression was very strong at  <dig> dpa, decreased rapidly at  <dig> dpa, stabilized at the later stages, and then increased at  <dig> dpa . however, type ii was the main expression pattern observed in wheat and in ae. peregrina. for instance, isa i and pul showed an up-down expression trend and were mainly expressed at the intermediate stages in wheat and at intermediate late stages in ae. peregrina . ss-i displayed a type i expression pattern in bd21: down-regulation from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa and up-regulation from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa. in contrast, it exhibited an up-down pattern from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa and was expressed at lower levels in wheat and ae. peregrina . ssii-b and ssii-c exhibited the type v expression trend  in all three genera .

western blot analysis and immunolocation of gbssi
gbssi is a key enzyme in amylase synthesis, and therefore it affects the physicochemical properties of flour and its end-products. starch granule-binding proteins were extracted and fractionated by sds-page and silver-stained . the isolated gbssi was confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  . the monoclonal antibodies against gbssi  demonstrated high specificity to gbssi . the results showed three kinds of gbssi in cs, corresponding to a, d, and b types  <cit>  . one and two protein bands were observed in ae. peregrina and bd <dig>  respectively.figure  <dig>

immunogold labeling was used to determine the subcellular localization and the amount of gbssi in bd <dig>  cs, and ae. peregrina. ultrathin sections of 12-day-old immature seeds were processed as described in methods. as shown in figure  <dig>  gbssi was detected mainly in the starch granules of immature seeds. the amount of gbssi in the b-granules of cs was greater than in bd <dig>  but the amount of gbssi was similar in the a-granules of cs and ae. peregrina.figure  <dig>

phosphorylation of gbssi in starch granules during grain development
in this study, we detected two phosphorylated peptides: one at threonine  <dig> and one at tyrosine  <dig> in gbssi of cs and ae. peregrina . the threonine and tyrosine residues were all located in the starch synthase catalytic domain . however, no phosphorylation at this position was observed in bd <dig>  as shown in figure 7a, the phosphorylated threonine in triticum and aegilops was replaced by valine in brachypodium; this substitution may be responsible for the absence of phosphorylation in bd <dig>  the ms spectrum of a relevant phosphopeptide  confirmed this result. the 3d structure of gbssi  was predicted using phyre <dig>  and revealed the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated sites of cs and bd <dig>  the figure shows that in the 3d model, structurally relevant amino acids forming the starch synthase catalytic domain are well conserved. there are  <dig> α-helices and  <dig> β-strands in the starch synthase catalytic domains of cs and bd <dig>  and the phosphorylated amino acid was always located between the third and fourth helix.figure  <dig>

discussion
brachypodium has only b-granules
in mature wheat , the endosperm contains three types of starch granules: a-granules 10–50 μm in diameter and b-granules  less than 10 μm in diameter  <cit> . previous studies confirmed that a-granules are formed at approximately 4– <dig> dpa and b-granules start to appear at approximately 10– <dig> dpa . in this study, the starch granules in bd <dig> appeared ~ <dig> dpa, and their diameters were remained 4–6 μm until maturity. thus, all starch granules in bd <dig> are b-granules. in contrast, guillon et al.  <cit>  showed that bd <dig> starch granules start to appear at ~ <dig> dpa. this is a bit longer than our observation, probably because of differences in growth conditions. b-granules in cs appeared at ~ <dig> dpa, and then, they grew slowly. their diameter was mostly in the range of 4–6 μm. a-granules in cs showed rapid growth at early stages and reached 10 μm at  <dig> dpa, and the diameter was mostly stable at 20–30 μm. starch granules in ae. peregrina appeared early and reached a diameter up to 10 μm at  <dig> dpa; all starch granules in ae. peregrina were a-granules, as reported previously  <cit> . thus, cs had both a- and b-granules whereas ae. peregrina and bd <dig> contained only a-granules or b-granules.

brachypodium, triticum, and aegilops are closely related, although the sizes of their starch granules differ. the varied composition of a- and b-granules as well as diverse a:b granule ratios in brachypodium, triticum, and aegilops suggest some genes specifically control the formation of a-granules and b-granules  <cit> . in wheat, a quantitative trait locus  associated with granule size was found on chromosome 4b  <cit> , and the qtls affecting the a:b ratio of granules are located on chromosome 4ds  <cit> . in barley, a qtl affecting the shape of b-granules was identified on chromosome 4h  <cit> . a recent study showed that a major qtl controlling the content of b-granules is located approximately 40 cm on the short arm of chromosome 4s of aegilops  <cit> . those authors speculate that it is the tetraploidization event that leads to inactivation of the b-granule loci  <cit> . however, b-granules exist in all the diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid lines of brachypodium; thus, the polyploidization event may not be responsible for the lack of a b-granule site in brachypodium. we speculate that the genes controlling a-granule loci may be silenced/deleted during evolution. a recent study showed that brachypodium has a highly conserved seed storage protein gli- <dig> as well as a glu- <dig> and a glu- <dig> locus just like in triticum and the related species, but almost no protein is detected because of abundant premature stop codons . moreover, previous analysis of hardness-like genes, the main determinants of the grain softness/hardness trait in wheat, showed that hardness-brachy genes in brachypodium could have been deleted independently during evolution  <cit> . we also theorize that the genes controlling a-granules may have been independently deleted/silenced when brachypodium and triticeae diverged nearly  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . finally, from the standpoint of morphology, because brachypodium cells are much smaller than those of other cereals, the larger a-granules are too hard to support. the major qtl controlling the content of a-and b-granules has not been identified, and further research to map and identify the gene responsible for a- or b-granule initiation remains to be done.

expression of starch synthesis-related genes and starch biosynthesis
the high expression level of starch synthesis-related genes at very early stages in brachypodium attracted our attention. other studies have shown that in the outer layers of cereal grains, starch accumulates transiently at the beginning of grain development, where it contributes to carbon storage during the earlier phases  <cit> . nakamura et al.  <cit>  reported that there is a thick pericarp layer with abundance of starch at  <dig> dpa, which persists until  <dig> dpa in wheat. the starch growth prevails in the early pericarp , then degenerates from  <dig> daf  <cit> . in our study, abundant starch appeared in the pericarp at the beginning of seed formation . as in barley, almost all genes showed low expression at  <dig> dpa in cs and ae. peregrina, even though there were four genes, including ssiii-a, sbei, sbeii-b, pul, whose expression was nearly undetectable  <cit> . on the other hand, all of the  <dig> genes displayed high expression in bd <dig> at  <dig> dpa . the high level of expression of genes during the early stages in bd <dig> may be responsible for the production and accumulation of starch in the pericarp.figure  <dig> 
synthesis of  amylose and  an amylopectin cluster in the endosperm. starch synthase i : catalyzes the synthesis of elongated amylopectin chains with the degree of polymerization  of approximately 6– <dig>  to form chains of dp 8– <dig>  ssii-a: catalyzes the synthesis of elongated amylopectin chains of dp 6– <dig> to dp 12– <dig>  ssiii catalyzes the synthesis of long amylopectin chains of dp 25– <dig> or greater. starch-branching enzyme i  plays an important but not exclusive role in the synthesis of b1-, b2-, and b <dig> chains. sbeii-b performs a distinct function in the formation of a-chains. debranching enzymes  remove unnecessary or erroneous branches.



nevertheless, these genes showed a relatively different expression pattern in the endosperm of these  <dig> genera. the amount of starch in the developing bd <dig> seeds increased steadily between  <dig> and  <dig> daf; in particular, the amount of starch showed an obvious increase at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. at the same time, most of the genes exhibited high expression at approximately 16– <dig> dpa . the expected expression of starch synthesis-related genes  also appeared at  <dig> to  <dig> dpa, and may be responsible for the synthesis of b-granules and increase of the endosperm. in this study, genes controlling synthesis of b-chains were expressed earlier than the genes related to a-chains. as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  ssii-a , ssiii-a  and sbei  were expressed earlier than ss-i and sbeiia and sbeiib . a-chains are linked to b-chains; therefore, b-chains should be synthesized early to provide support for a-chains. although in cs, strong expression mostly appeared ~ <dig> dpa, which was responsible for the synthesis of b-granules, it is unexpected that sbei was expressed later than sbeii-a and sbeii-b. the same phenomenon was also observed in ae. peregrina: sbei was expressed later than sbeii-a and sbeii-b were. since the sequence of sbes in brachypodium, wheat, rice and maize showed a high similarity and were classified into the same cluster, respectively . we can hypothesize that sbes in cs and ae. peregrina have the functions that are opposite to those in brachypodium, rice, and maize, which sbei produces longer b-chains, whereas sbeii generates shorter a-chains  <cit> . in cs and ae. peregrina, sbeii-a and sbeii-b may be responsible for the synthesis of longer b-chains, and sbei may perform an important function in the synthesis of shorter a-chains. this hypothesis is supported by previous research in barley: radchuk et al.  <cit>  showed that sbei expressed later than sbeiis, and regina et al.  <cit>  suggested the reduction of sbeiis led to a decrease of dp 10– <dig> chains in barley. thus, the function of sbes in wheat may be similar to that in barley, whereas the roles of sbes in brachypodium are the same as those in rice and maize. although the sequences of sbei and sbeiis are different, the domains and 3d structure were similar, so it is possible that sbes can have functions of mutual exchange in different species. dbes are mutually complementary in the hydrolysis  of α--linkages in amylopectin and pullulan during formation of new chains   <cit> . the details regarding the function of dbes are not known. in this study, isa i, isa ii, and pul displayed a down-up expression pattern in bd <dig>  which may be responsible for the hydrolysis of starch in the pericarp, whereas they showed an up-down pattern in cs and ae. peregrina. it is known that the starch content of the endosperm is less than 10% of the whole brachypodium grain, much less than that in wheat   <cit> . on the other hand, there were only b-granules in brachypodium, and the expression of starch synthesis-related genes was lower in the endosperm of brachypodium compared to wheat and ae. peregrina.

phosphorylation may play an important role in amylose synthesis
protein phosphorylation, as the most common posttranslational modification in vivo, regulates and controls biological processes such as transcription and translation, cellular and communication, proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . other studies proved that the enzymes  binding starch granules, such as ssi, ssii-a, sbei, sbeii-a, and sbeii-b, can be phosphorylated and can participate in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . grimaud et al.  <cit>  showed that gbssi can be stained with a phosphoprotein-specific dye in maize; however, phosphorylation sites in gbssi have not been identified. in this study, we identified two gbssi phosphorylation sites in cs and ae. peregrina, including threonine  <dig> and tyrosine  <dig>  and both of which are located within the starch synthase catalytic domain. although no phosphorylated peptides were found at these positions in bd <dig>  sequence alignment suggests the thr <dig> in cs and ae. peregrina is replaced by val in bd21; this substitution may be responsible for the lack of phosphorylation sites in bd <dig>  few studies have described how phosphorylation sites influence amylase activity. some have indicated that the starch synthase catalytic domain is responsible for glucan-substrate recognition and affinity; meanwhile, tetlow et al.  <cit>  showed that phosphorylation improves amylase activity and increases amylose synthesis; moreover, recent studies of the interaction of the farnesyl moiety with the hydrophobic patch on 14-3- <dig> showed that phosphorylation increases affinity between the interacting proteins  <cit> . finally, amylose content is lower in b-granules  than in a-granules   <cit> . thus, we hypothesize that the phosphorylation sites in the starch synthase catalytic domain may play an important role in recognizing and attracting glucan substrates. we also propose the exciting possibility that phosphorylation increases the activity of gbssi in a-granules and thereby improves amylose synthesis there. the influence of different phosphorylation sites for amylase activity requires further study.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated the presence of only b-granules in bd <dig>  and they appear at ~ <dig> dpa with a diameter of 4–6 μm. the expression of key genes in the studied genera is consistent with the dynamic development of starch granules. the expression of key genes in starch biosynthesis of bd <dig> mainly occurs at early and intermediate stages, for the synthesis of starch in the pericarp and for the increase of the number or size of starch granules, respectively. in contrast, the high expression of biosynthetic genes at intermediate stages in cs and ae. peregrina is mostly responsible for production of new b-granules and for the increase in the size of starch granules, respectively. the expression of the genes controlling synthesis of b1- or b2-chains occurs earlier compared to a-chains. gbssi exists in b-granules of cs, in greater amounts compared to bd <dig>  there are two phosphorylation sites  in triticum and aegilops, whereas thr <dig> was replaced by val in bd <dig>  phosphorylation of gbssi may play a central role in amylose synthesis.
