BACKGROUND
seed protection and dispersal are the main functions of the fruit. fruit initiation and development play a crucial role in plant adaptation, and successful fruiting strategies are important drivers of colonization of new niches. fruit and seed set are generally characterized by extensive cell division and coordinated development of maternal and filial tissues, while growth and maturation stages are characterized by cell expansion and accumulation of storage products, mainly proteins, starch and oils  <cit> . the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of genetic networks operating during specific processes of fruit and seed development have revealed the involvement of a wide range of molecular players including enzymes, regulatory proteins as well as hormonal signals. molecular studies of fruit development have been mostly conducted in fleshy fruits such as tomato , grape , blueberry  <cit> , sweet orange  <cit>  or melon  <cit> , due to their importance for human consumption. genes related to fruit ripening have been extensively studied in tomato, grape and sweet orange  <cit>  and genes specifically expressed in fruits have been identified in apple  <cit>  and date palm  <cit> . in addition, arabidopsis has proven very informative because its silique is a dehiscent fruit characteristic of the legumes and thus represents another exceptionally important fruit type in terms of human and animal food.

much less attention has been paid to other types of fruits that although not generally used for human consumption, have huge ecological importance. the fagaceae family comprises more than one thousand species half of which belong to the quercus genus, commonly known as oaks. the oaks produce an indehiscent fruit, usually termed acorn, and are characteristically adapted to extremely variable habitats being widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere in an almost continuous pattern.

cork oak , native to the western mediterranean and north africa regions  <cit>  characterized by hot and dry summers, has been considered a keystone forest tree species in the ecosystems where it grows  <cit> . the species is mostly recognized for producing cork, which is removed from adult trees at regular intervals of at least 9 years, sustaining highly profitable cork industries  <cit> . cork oak has an unusual fruiting strategy as it is the only known oak species with annual and biennial acorns on the same tree . other features such as bigger acorn size have been related to drought tolerance  and higher seed germination ability  and thus may strongly impact the capacity for species natural regeneration, the most common way of cork oak propagation  <cit> . seed development and germination are critical for the successful maintenance of the cork oak growing regions .

during development, the acorn undergoes many biochemical and physiological changes which likely confer the ability to survive the severe drought periods and high temperatures. the few studies that have been conducted in oak acorns have focused on morphological, physiological and phenological aspects  <cit>  and a few reports exist on aspects of the male and female flower development  and flower/fruit anatomy  <cit> . although some transcriptomic and genomic studies have also been published in oak species , it was only recently that the transcriptome of cork oak has started to be analysed in multiple tissues, developmental stages and physiological conditions  <cit> . in this context, and to gain knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cork oak acorn and to identify transcripts putatively related with adaptive traits, we have analysed the dynamics of the transcriptome of acorns along five stages of development, defined according to morphological characters, from early fruiting stages to fruit and seed maturation. our approach identified genes with potentially relevant roles during acorn development focusing specially on transcripts coding for putative transcription factors and transcription regulators or transcripts associated to water related processes including response, transport and deprivation.

RESULTS
categorization of cork oak acorns into different developmental stages
although the fruits are often defined as seed-bearing structures formed from a mature ovary, many structures that might be defined as fruit are in fact composed of different tissue types  <cit> . other definitions have been proposed, such as the one by van der pijl  <cit>  that considers the fruit as the dispersal unit. in this work we use the term acorn for simplicity, referring in fact to all the tissues enclosed by the pericarp, including the seed. it should be pointed out that at maturity most of the acorn mass consists of seed tissues, mainly cotyledons. cork oak acorns were collected from late june to november in order to cover all developmental stages, from early development to full maturation. a staging system was established based on several morphological aspects . since the dimensions of the acorns were variable in the same collection date among trees in different locations, additional features were used to establish developmental classes. these included the presence of a visible endosperm, multiple embryos or a dominant embryo within the developing seed, covering of the acorn by the cupule and colour of the pericarp . accordingly, eight stages of acorn development were established . in the first stage , fertilization of the ovules may have occurred already but in most cases the endosperm was not yet visible. in the s <dig> stage multiple fertilised ovules were visible, however only one continued to grow becoming dominant and causing abortion of the other ovules . during s <dig> and s <dig>  the embryo continues to develop and in the remaining stages  further enlargement of the cotyledons takes place, with full maturation being reached in s <dig> fig.  <dig> developmental stages established for the cork oak acorn. a cork oak fruits collected at different developmental stages . the scale bar corresponds to 1 mm in s <dig> to s <dig> and to 5 mm in s <dig> to s <dig>  b cork oak fruits at stages s3-s <dig> after removal of the cupule , or cupule and pericarp  exposing the seed, and acorn measurement parameters  used for acorn staging. d, maximum diameter of the acorn; pi, portion of the acorn outside the cupule; p, acorn portion covered by the cupule. the scale bar corresponds to 1 mm in s <dig> to s <dig> and to 5 mm in s7

sequencing and assembly of the cork oak acorn transcriptome
the sequencing of the five non-normalized libraries corresponding to samples from stages s <dig>  s <dig>  s3 + s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> aimed at gene expression analysis during acorn development. in addition, two normalized libraries prepared from rna of cork oak acorns or from isolated embryos were sequenced to favour the detection of rare transcripts and thereby facilitate the assembly. after pre-processing,  <dig> , <dig> high-quality sequences were retained and used in the assembly and mapping steps. the final average length of the reads was  <dig> and 400 bp for the normalized and non-normalized libraries, respectively .table  <dig> read statistics from libraries of cork oak acorn and embryos before and after pre-processing. embryo tissues isolated from acorns belonging to stages s3-s <dig> and s <dig> were termed em3-em <dig> and em <dig>  respectively



the seven libraries were assembled by mira and newbler . mira assembly contained  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>  % of which were longer than 500 bp. newbler assembly contained  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>  % of which were longer than 500 bp. the merging of the mira and the newbler assembly using cap <dig> resulted in  <dig>  contigs that were deposited in ena .  <dig>  % of these contigs were longer than 500 bp. the assembled transcripts were classified as complete, terminal, internal or novel by comparison with the complete plant proteins in uniprotkb database .  <dig>  contigs did not have any homologous sequence in the tested database . however, it was possible to predict a clear orf for  <dig>  of them, and they were classified as novel.table  <dig>

completeness of the q. suber transcriptome by comparison with other fagaceae
the proteins in the q. suber assembly were compared to the proteins from other four quercus spp., two castanea spp. and a fagus sp. for this purpose, we obtained the assembled transcriptomes from the fagaceae project  or ncbi . the transcripts in each transcriptome were classified as complete, terminal, internal or novel by comparison with the complete plant proteins in uniprotkb database, as we had previously done for q. suber . our q. suber assembly had the higher number of complete proteins  and the second higher number of total proteins .

on average,  <dig>  % of the proteins from any of the tested species could be found in our de novo assembled q. suber transcriptome when it was used as the target database . on the other hand, when the q. suber proteins were used as query, we found that between  <dig> and 80 % of the queries aligned to each of the other transcriptomes, and the higher ratios corresponded to the more complete castanea mollisina and castanea dentata transcriptomes. of all the queries, only contig <dig> was not found in any other transcriptome.

functional annotation of the q. suber transcriptome
all  <dig>  transcripts were compared with the ncbi non-redundant  protein database using blastx with an e-value of 1e- <dig>  which resulted in  <dig>   sequences with a significant alignment . from the total number of transcripts,  <dig>   transcripts had the best match to vitis vinifera sequences, followed by  <dig>  ;  <dig>   and  <dig>   transcripts that matched to ricinus communis, populus trichocarpa and glycine max sequences, respectively. similar results have been obtained in the transcriptome annotation for other plant species and linked to conserved biochemical, morphological and developmental characteristics  <cit> . the number of alignments obtained among the fagaceae family was very low:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences matched with sequences of castanea sativa, fagus sylvatica, quercus suber and castanea mollissima, respectively . this is mainly due to the limited amount of data available at the genbank database for non-sequenced species. most of the alignments showed a similitude between  <dig> and 90 % . only about  <dig>  % of the total number of transcripts present in q. suber transcriptome was found to be fruit or seed specific but, according to our analysis of the conserved motifs and structures in the sequences, the majority of these transcripts are unknown .

 <dig>   transcripts were annotated with at least one gene ontology  term . there was a direct relation between the sequence length and percentage of annotated sequences and over 75 % of the sequences longer than  <dig> kb could be annotated .

 <dig>   q. suber transcripts had a homologous in the a. thaliana genome . each transcript was annotated with the go terms of its arabidopsis homologous gene. additionally, each a. thaliana gene was annotated with its ncbi cogs, if any exists, and this annotation was also associated backwards to the original q. suber transcript . in order to compare our de novo transcriptome and identify cogs specific to q. suber, a similar approach was followed for q. petraea, q. robur and the cork oak ests database .  <dig>  ;  <dig>   and  <dig>   transcripts from q. petraea, q. robur and codb were homologous to genes from the a. thaliana genome, respectively. the distribution of protein clusters is summarized in a venn diagram .  <dig>   of a total of  <dig>  cogs were present in all the species and  <dig> cogs were specific to q. suber. of these  <dig> cogs,  <dig>  % were involved in replication, recombination and repair,  <dig>  % in rna processing and modification,  <dig>  % in translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis,  <dig>  % in cell cycle control, cell division and chromosome partition, 5 % in post-translational modifications, protein turnover and chaperones and 5 % in transcription. finally,  <dig>  % of the  <dig> cogs were unknown or poorly characterized .

pathway analysis during cork oak acorn development
 <dig>   sequences were annotated according to their homology with known enzymes that belonged to  <dig> pathways  and all  <dig> kegg groups of related pathways  . the carbohydrate metabolism was the group most represented, which also includes several of the more represented pathways, such as starch and sucrose, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar, pyruvate, and galactose metabolic pathways. the second most represented group was amino acid metabolism, which includes phenylalanine metabolism. when the number of different enzymes is considered, the more relevant pathways were glycine, serine and threonine; arginine and proline and cysteine and methionine pathways. the third most represented group was lipid metabolism followed by energy metabolism. among the most represented pathways were also purine and pyrimidine metabolism, methane metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis .

the reads from the five non-normalized libraries were mapped to the transcripts in the final assembly to quantify the expression in each stage. the number of mapped reads of the transcripts belonging to the same pathway was summed up to determine the expression of each pathway on time . the normalized expression values for the level  <dig> pathways were represented in a heatmap . while the immune system was the most up-regulated pathway in the first acorn developmental stage , followed by metabolism of other aminoacids and secondary metabolites, in middle stages of development  up-regulation of carbohydrate, nucleotide, glycan biosynthesis and energy metabolism was observed. signal transduction pathways were up-regulated only in s <dig>  while amino acid metabolism and translation were specifically up-regulated in s3s <dig>  s <dig> exhibited an expression profile markedly different from other developmental stages where lipid metabolism and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were specifically up-regulated.fig.  <dig> heatmap of the expression levels of the kegg level  <dig> pathways. the expression levels were normalized in z scores, with signals from red  to green 



differentially expressed genes  during cork oak acorn development
from the mapping of the reads of the five non-normalized libraries to the assembled transcriptome,  <dig>  genes were identified as expressed during any of the developmental stages,  <dig>  transcripts  were expressed in all the stages and  <dig>   were specific to one stage. the total number of transcripts present in each stage was  <dig>  ;  <dig>  ;  <dig>  ;  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively from s <dig> to s <dig> .

of the  <dig>  transcripts expressed during acorn development,  <dig>   were considered de . from those  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   transcripts were de between stages s <dig> and s <dig>  s3s <dig> and s <dig>  s <dig> and s3s <dig>  and s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively.  <dig> transcripts  were de in more than one stage transition . from the degs only  <dig>  were found as acorn specific, with  <dig> transcripts in stage s <dig>   <dig> in stage s3s <dig>   <dig> in stage s <dig> and  <dig> in the last stage of the acorn development . however, the majority of these transcripts are of unknown function .fig.  <dig> venn diagram illustrating the number of transcripts differentially expressed between two consecutive stages of development



an enrichment analysis by f-fisher test  comparing the set of  <dig>  degs versus the complete transcriptome evidenced  <dig> over-represented go terms . one third of the degs were involved in responses to abiotic stimulus, one fifth in carbohydrate catabolism, and other fifth in the catabolism and generation of energetic compounds. go terms related with transport process, such as water and auxin polar transport, or development and growth were also significantly represented .

degs were clustered in six groups according to their expression profile on time . since each cluster contains genes with a peak of expression in specific stage of development, an enrichment analysis  of the genes in each cluster versus the complete transcriptome evidenced the dominant processes in those stages . eight go terms were over-represented at s <dig>  including response to stimulus, response to osmotic and salt stress, and hexose transmembrane transport. forty-one go terms were over-represented at s <dig> , including response to stress, to water, to water deprivation, to osmotic and to salt stresses, as well as water transport, and transmembrane transport. at s3s <dig> stages   <dig> go terms were over-represented, including the previous terms related with response, and also regulation of meristem growth and of meristem development, among others. thirty-one go terms were over-represented at s <dig> , and  <dig> go terms at s <dig> and s <dig> , including glycogen synthesis and metabolism, carbohydrates  metabolism, as well as starch synthesis and xylem development. fifty go terms were over-expressed at s <dig> , including chitin binding and metabolism and aminoglycan, amino sugar, glucosamine and polysaccharide catabolism.fig.  <dig> clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes  according to their expression profiles



genes related to response to water, water deprivation or water transport
from the total deg,  <dig>  were related to water response, deprivation and transport, and distributed across all the developmental stages but over-represented in s <dig>  followed by the last developmental stage  . a shortlist of these transcripts is presented in table  <dig>  including those that have a known arabidopsis homolog, are specific of a single cluster and have a level of expression at a given stage higher than 85 % compared with its expression in all stages. fulfilling these criteria and mostly expressed in the first stage of acorn development  we found an homolog of the abc transporter family, multidrug resistance p-glycoproteins  as well as an homolog of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  <dig> . in cluster b, with a peak of expression in stage s <dig>  an homolog of the arabidopsis β-amylase  <dig>  was identified. in the subsequent stages of acorn development  we found a transcript with homology to the responsive to desiccation  <dig> . specific to cluster d we found homologs of the alpha-glucan phosphorylase  <dig> , early responsive to dehydration  <dig>  and the aba insensitive  <dig> . with an expression profile that fits in cluster e, was a member of the early responsive to dehydration, an homolog of the erd <dig>  transcripts putatively encoding for members of late embryogenesis abundant protein family, such as late embryogenesis abundant 4– <dig> , dehydrin xero  <dig>  and drought-induced  <dig> , for lipid transfer protein  <dig> , for uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase 74e <dig>  and for metallothionein  <dig>  were almost uniquely expressed in the last stage of the acorn development .table  <dig> shortlist of differentially expressed transcripts annotated as involved in response to water. transcripts with a known arabidopsis homolog were selected from a total of  <dig> degs in this category, based on their specificity to a single cluster and higher expression level in a given stage as determined by a stage expression factor  higher than  <dig> . to have transcripts specific of cluster d in the short list, the stage expression factor considered in this case was  <dig> . expression in each stage is represented as normalized counts

transcriptional regulators differentially expressed during acorn development
transcription factors have important roles in gene expression due to their ability to bind specific dna sequences and control transcription by acting as transcriptional activators or repressors. out of  <dig>  degs during acorn development a total of  <dig>  were annotated as tfs or transcriptional regulators . these transcripts were almost equally distributed among the different clusters, but slightly up-regulated in early development, representing approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the transcripts in clusters a and b, respectively, and less expressed in the late stages of acorn development representing  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total de tfs in clusters e and f, respectively.

a list of selected transcripts that have a known arabidopsis homolog and are annotated as transcription factors or transcriptional regulators is presented in table  <dig>  including those that are specific of a single cluster and are also stage-specific or belong to tf families with well characterized roles in plant development. we found homologs of myb domain protein  <dig>  and auxin response factor  <dig>  specifically expressed in stage s <dig>  and a member of the myb-related family, homolog of the peroxidase  <dig>  specifically present in stage s3s <dig> . also other transcripts were identified which expression was restricted to the late stages of development, such as a homolog of the far1-related sequence  <dig>  in stage s <dig> . interesting genes from well-known families of tfs or transcriptional regulators such as nac, bhlh, class ii knotted1-like homeobox and oleosin are also represented during the cork oak acorn development. up-regulation in the early stages of development  was observed for class ii knotted1-like homeobox genes. during the late stages of the acorn development transcripts putatively coding for oleosin  were up-regulated. transcripts coding for nac and bhlh transcription factor families were found de across all the studied developmental stages .table  <dig> shortlist of differentially expressed transcripts putatively coding for transcription factors and transcriptional regulators. transcripts with a known arabidopsis homolog were selected according the following criteria: transcript is either specific of a single cluster and is stage-specific or belongs to tf families with well characterized roles in plant development

validation of the differential expression profiles by rt-qpcr
several genes were selected to validate the data obtained by sequencing with  <dig> technology . twenty degs related to water responses, seven of which also annotated as tfs, were chosen for the validation of expression profiles by reverse transcription quantitative real-time pcr . two transcripts belong to cluster a, six to cluster b, three to c, four transcripts belong to d and five to f. correlation between the gene expression levels and the profiles obtained by  <dig> technology was demonstrated by pearson correlation  with most of the genes showing strong or moderately strong correlation  <cit> . in addition, these results also validate that the transcript assemblies are correct for the sequences tested and support the robustness of the transcriptome assembly performed in this work.table  <dig> primers used in rt-qpcr for validation of the expression profile obtained by  <dig> sequencing.

discussion
based on available genomic resources and ngs technologies we provide here the first overview of the dynamics of the transcriptome along different stages of the acorn development in a fagaceae species. the analysis of our data highlighted specific genes and processes relevant to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in cork oak acorn development, and it is expected that this knowledge can be transferable to other oak species of great ecological value. the studied stages of development were established according to morphological criteria and to previously described reports on cork oak reproductive features  <cit>  in order to cover the whole fruit and seed developmental process.

a set of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were identified with roles in a range of biological processes. we then focused our analysis on groups of transcripts with putative functions in transcriptional regulation and traits likely relevant to seed survival and dispersal, including mechanisms related to water response, water transport and water deprivation.

a de novo transcriptome of cork oak acorn
a de novo transcriptome assembly with the data here generated allowed us to identify the transcripts expressed during the acorn developmental process, some of which classified as novel. this de novo assembly facilitated the mapping of reads in unique positions since it was not necessary to allow mismatches between reads and reference. in fact, we discarded the marginal number of reads mapping in several positions. assemblers of  <dig> transcriptome data have been systematically compared using real and simulated datasets. in such reviews, newbler  <cit>  and mira  <cit>  outperformed other assemblers . newbler usually assembles longer contigs that often cover more than the 80 % of the reference sequences. mira joins reads in a more conservative way than newbler, which prevents chimeric contigs and generates bigger assemblies using more bases and containing higher number of contigs, but some of them are redundant. kumar et al.  <cit>  proposed an assembly strategy that was used for the de novo assembly of pyrosequencing data from chickpea  <cit> , by merging individual assemblies using a traditional overlap-layout-consensus assembler, such as cap <dig>  <cit> . merged datasets aligned better to reference datasets and were more consistent in the total span and number and size of contigs than individual assemblies. in our case, the number of complete contigs  was higher in the merged assembly than in the individual ones, while the percentage of c-terminal and n-terminal contigs was smaller in the merged assembly than in any of the original assemblies . this supports that several contigs from the same transcript were merged. when compared with other fagaceae transcriptomes , we report the highest number of complete proteins and different unique uniprot ids, which evidenced the advantages of this strategy.

pathway analysis revealed that carbohydrate metabolism was the group  most represented in the transcriptome of developing cork oak acorns, especially in the middle stages of development. the enrichment analysis performed in the different clusters evidenced also the timing when a specific metabolic process appears prevalent. using this approach, carbohydrates metabolism and starch synthesis, were found over-represented in the transcriptome of acorns at late stages of development, both s <dig> and s <dig>  however, specific processes like hexose transmembrane transport were found over-represented in early stages of acorn development, where actively dividing cells contribute to a rapid growth of the fruit. in general, hexoses favour cell division and expansion, whereas sucrose favours differentiation and maturation  <cit> . this is also supported by the analysis of degs. for instance during the middle stages of acorn development, several up-regulated degs homologous to sucrose synthases were identified which are putatively involved in the synthesis of udp-glucose and adp-glucose linked to cellulose and starch biosynthesis  <cit> . these include sucrose synthase  <dig> , and sucrose synthase  <dig> . this is consistent with an active synthesis of cellulose and starch during these developmental stages, possibly related to the mobilization of sucrose into pathways involved in structural and storage functions. one fifth of the identified degs are related to carbohydrate metabolism and some of these transcripts, involved in water response or transcriptional regulation, are discussed below.

response to water across acorn development
at complete maturity cork oak acorns contain a large and fleshy embryo with high water content. the natural shedding of cork oak acorns coincides with complete maturity and acorns left on the ground after shedding will either germinate or lose their viability as a result of desiccation  <cit> . increased tolerance to desiccation may thus represent an important factor in cork oak regeneration success and the identification of transcripts related to response to water, water deprivation or water transport may prove relevant for highlighting genes with adaptive roles. in agreement with previous reports in arabidopsis  <cit> , the degs annotated as being related to water responses during acorn development are not fruit specific. a high number of degs in this category were identified in the cluster of transcripts with a higher expression at the last stage of acorn development corresponding to maturity, probably reflecting some reduction in water content at this stage, but also during the early stages. the early stage of fruit and seed development is one of the most sensitive periods of the plant life cycle to abiotic stresses such as drought  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising that transcripts involved in response to water stress are up regulated at these stages as to ensure the protection of offspring against conditions of low water availability common during the summer.

among the transcripts strongly related to drought stress that were identified in early development are several homologs of the rd family, including rd <dig> and other members not listed in table  <dig> such as rd <dig>  rd <dig>  rd <dig> and rd29b. rd <dig> and rd <dig>  were previously described to respond to dehydration  and used as drought-induced marker genes in different plant species . rd <dig> is expressed in the early and middle stages of arabidopsis seed development  <cit>  and in our transcriptome analysis it is also highly expressed in the middle stages of the acorn development . during the early stage of the acorn development , a putative homolog of mdr <dig> annotated as being involved in response to water deprivation was also highly expressed. mdr <dig> belongs to the large family of the abc  transporter superfamily and has been mainly characterized for its role in the basipetal redirection of auxin from the root tip  <cit> . with the same expression profile  was a putative homolog of ubc <dig>  highly induced under drought stress  <cit> . recently, functional studies in tomato revealed that ubc <dig> is involved in the regulation of fruit ripening  <cit>  and, it is possible that it plays a similar function in cork oak acorn development. carbohydrate metabolism-related transcripts with homologies to β-amylase genes, which are described as contributing to osmoprotection during desiccation  <cit> , were also found differentially expressed during acorn development. while some of the amylase transcripts, e.g. homologous to the a. thaliana chloroplast β-amylases bam1/bamy <dig>  were up-regulated from the early to middle stages, other transcripts with homology to β-amylases bam <dig> or bam <dig> were up-regulated in later stages up to s <dig>  being almost absent in earlier stages. the significance of these divergent expression patterns is not currently clear. it is possible that different roles related for instance to hormone signalling and/or acquisition of desiccation tolerance involving the accumulation of soluble sugars through starch degradation  <cit>  are played by these enzymes during seed development.

specific to cluster d are two transcripts putatively related to abscisic acid  signalling/responses, homologs of phs <dig> and abi <dig>  phs <dig> is a negative regulator of aba signalling involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture  <cit> . its expression pattern under different stresses vary significantly among species but it has been associated to drought responses  <cit> . like in barley, we detected low expression of this transcript in early acorn development and its putative involvement in the regulation of starch synthesis during endosperm development  <cit>  may explain its up-regulation in later stages of seed development . with the same expression profile is a homolog of a well characterized gene related to acquisition of tolerance to seed desiccation, abi <dig>  putatively encoding a tf expressed in seeds that mediates aba responses. in arabidopsis, abi <dig> is required during seed maturation for the accumulation of seed storage proteins, dormancy onset and maintenance and for the acquisition of seed desiccation tolerance  <cit> . our results seem in agreement with a tight regulation of the mechanisms controlled by abi <dig> during cork oak seed development towards maturation, such as aba responsiveness and synthesis and accumulation of proline in order to increase stress tolerance in the embryo  <cit> . the expression profile of abi <dig> seems consistent with alterations in aba content as described for the recalcitrant seeds  of quercus robur  <cit>  and corresponding aba-induced processes along development. like phs <dig> and abi <dig>  an homolog of the early responsive to dehydration  <dig>  is up-regulated in stage s <dig> . erd genes are rapidly activated by dehydration and the encoded proteins constitute the first line of defense against drought stress  <cit> . in arabidopsis erd <dig> is a common regulator of the aba response and salicylic acid -dependent pathway  <cit>  encoding a protein with functions in stress responses, including drought  <cit> .

during the last stage of acorn development  several transcripts protrude from the list of degs annotated as related to water responses. a homolog of ltp <dig>  known in arabidopsis to be highly expressed in mature siliques and induced by drought  <cit> , was specific to the late stages of acorn development. the arabidopsis ltp <dig> positively regulates the plant response to drought stress through the transcriptional activation of the cuticular wax biosynthesis to avoid dehydration  <cit> . also well represented in cluster f are the late embryogenesis abundant , the protein family to which di <dig> belongs, as well as xero <dig> and lea4– <dig>  this protein family plays major roles in desiccation tolerance  <cit>  and is characteristically accumulated in the last stages of seed development  <cit>  as also observed in our data. the arabidopsis xero <dig> was only detected in seeds whereas di <dig> was detected ubiquitously  <cit> . lea4- <dig> highly accumulates during late arabidopsis embryogenesis and in dry seeds, and upon constitutive expression it confers tolerance to severe drought  <cit> . in oil palm lea <dig> is solely expressed in the mesocarp, and similarly to what we have obtained in the cork oak acorns, it is expressed in the late stages of fruit development, being probably involved in plant adaptation and stress  responsive pathway  <cit> . also di <dig> is known to be up-regulated under abiotic stresses and xero <dig> is thought to protect cellular components from dehydration stress  <cit> . accumulation of lea proteins during seed maturation and in response to altered water status was previously observed in oak species  <cit> . however, their effect in increasing drought tolerance in oaks is not as extensive as in non-recalcitrant seeds  <cit> . another worth mentioning transcript putatively related to desiccation tolerance and up-regulated in the last stage of the acorn development is a homolog of the ugt74e <dig>  encoding a hydrogen peroxide–responsive udp-glucosyltransferase. ectopic expression of ugt74e <dig> was associated to changes in plant architecture and to an increased tolerance to drought and salt stresses  <cit> . increased tolerance to abiotic stresses, such as drought, was also verified in transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the cotton type  <dig> metallothionein   <cit> , a homolog of which was also identified up-regulated in late acorn development. interestingly, many members of this group are associated with fruit ripening . like in the cork oak acorns, also in apple and kiwifruit mt <dig> was barely detected in young fruits but accumulated later with fruit development and fruit ripening  <cit>  suggesting a role in the ripening process, as well as in setting drought tolerance in this phase of development.

transcriptional regulators during acorn development
transcriptional regulators are crucial for plant developmental processes through their function in the regulation of gene expression, and fruit and seed development is no exception. in arabidopsis which, like cork oak, has dry fruits, it has been revealed that the core and extended genetic network controlling fruit development consists entirely of interactions among transcription factors  <cit> . in fact, we found a significant number of differentially expressed transcripts coding for putative transcription factors and other transcriptional regulators along the acorn developmental stages covered by our analysis. however, our results support a slightly more prominent role of these transcripts in early development  becoming less represented towards acorn maturity. in fact, it is during this stage that the transcription machinery seems more active as evidenced by the higher number of expressed transcripts.

genes of the auxin response factor family  are key regulators of auxin-modulated gene expression and can either activate or repress transcription of auxin-responsive genes  <cit> . a putative ortholog of arf <dig> was found specifically expressed in cluster a, suggesting an important role in the initial phase of the acorn development. in tomato, arf <dig> was described to repress the expression of auxin-responsive genes, playing a key role in the control of sugar metabolism during fruit development, through the regulation of photosynthetic activity as well as chlorophyll and starch accumulation  <cit> . moreover, it was found highly expressed in the pericarp tissues of immature fruit and then undergoing a marked decline at the onset of ripening associated with the increase in sugar content accumulation  <cit> . it is possible that the transcript identified in our data has similar functions in the cork oak acorn development. interestingly, arf <dig> is a putative target gene of ta-sirnas produced from cleavage of the ta-sirna locus  <dig>  directed by mir <dig> which was reported as differentially expressed in cork oak tissues  <cit> .

two putative class ii knotted1-like homeobox  genes were also up-regulated in the early stages of acorn development, one in s <dig>  and the other one in s <dig> . knat <dig> was previously reported to have a role in seed development, specifically in embryo sac development and during megagametogenesis  <cit> . more recently, knox <dig> tfs were shown to have a critical role in establishing an alternation of generations in land plants by preventing the haploid-specific body plan from developing in the diploid plant body  <cit> , which appears consistent with the up-regulated expression of cork oak putative knox <dig> genes in early acorn developmental stages.

one putative myb and one putative myb-related transcripts, homologs of the arabidopsis myb <dig> and prx <dig>  respectively, were specifically detected in the early and mid-stages of acorn development . myb transcription factors have diverse functions in plants including development, secondary metabolism, hormone signal transduction, disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . myb <dig> belongs to the r2r3-myb gene family  <cit> , which members have been described as the primary regulators of fruit flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> , among other functions  <cit> . within the major flavonoid compounds present in flowers and fruits, the proanthocyanidins are astringent compounds that can offer protection during the early stages of fruit development against herbivory and pathogen attack  <cit> . the specific presence of this transcript in the first stage of fruit development here analysed would be consistent with such a function in cork oak acorns, however, other roles should not be excluded. our study also showed that the cork oak putative homolog to atprx <dig> was expressed in a specific stage of acorn developmental, s3s <dig> . this may be related to the significant increase in the size of the acorn from this point onwards, and therefore increased cell wall expansion processes, but it can be also due to an increase in hardiness of the fruit, suggesting that this gene may function in the lignification process in cork oak acorn, consistent with previously described roles .

transcripts identified as specifically expressed in the last stages of development, included a putative transcription factor gene of the far <dig> family, similar to the frs <dig>  which is a homolog of fhy <dig>  several studies report that fhy <dig> and far <dig> are required for regulating various aspects of plant processes, such as far-red-mediated seedling de-etiolation, the circadian clock, chloroplast division, and chlorophyll biosynthesis . tang et al.  <cit>  have recently reported that knock-out mutants of fhy <dig> and/or far <dig> have reduced sensitivity to aba-mediated inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth, lose water faster, and are less tolerant to drought stress than are wild type plants. given the significance of drought tolerance traits for the successful cork oak natural regeneration process, it is tempting to consider that the putative homolog of frs <dig> in the cork oak mature acorn may be involved in conferring tolerance to water stress conditions. however, other roles are also possible  <cit> .

another family of proteins described as transcriptional regulators , the oleosins  were also found specifically up-regulated in the last stages of the acorn development . this is in accordance with the reported function of these plant specific genes in the control of oil body structure and accumulation of seed reserves, affecting seed germination and embryo phenotypes  <cit> . recent work in different species showed an increase in their accumulation during seed development .

several members of two major families of tfs were present in all stages of the acorn development, bhlh and nac. as an example of a putative bhlh tf gene, a homolog of the arabidopsis bhlh glabra <dig> , was up-regulated during the late stages of the acorn development  when the acorn pericarp starts to become visible out of the cupule and turning brown. if the function of this transcript is conserved, then it is tempting to speculate that its up-regulation during late acorn development is related to the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit>  that occurs during this phase, and that it may play an important function in seed dispersal by attracting herbivores. putative nac family members were also found along different stages of the acorn development. this family of tfs plays important roles in responses to plant biotic and abiotic stress  <cit>  but also in developmental processes such as seed and embryo development  <cit> . our data revealed three different up-regulated transcripts coding for the nac protein family at the s <dig> developmental stage, two at s <dig> and s <dig> and one in both s <dig> and s <dig>  one of these transcripts up-regulated in s <dig>  rd <dig>  has been mentioned above in relation to response to water  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our analysis allowed to cluster transcripts differentially expressed along acorn development in different profiles showing up-regulation in specific stages of development. while the de transcripts putatively coding for transcriptional regulators associated to several biological processes were found up-regulated in given developmental stages throughout the whole acorn developmental process, other transcripts involved in specific processes such as response to water or carbohydrate metabolism were over-represented in particular stages. future functional analysis of genes of interest identified in this work will be important to devise successful strategies for regeneration and breeding of this important species. this is especially important when considering the climate changes predicted for the mediterranean region in the near future  <cit>  and the fact that drought is the main selection agent in mediterranean ecosystems  <cit> . additionally, this dataset significantly contributes to increase the still scarce information on cork oak genomics providing tools for further molecular dissection of cork oak biology.
