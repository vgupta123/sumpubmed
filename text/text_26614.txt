BACKGROUND
the silkworm  has been domesticated for more than  <dig> years because of the industrial importance of sericulture. besides being used for silk production, the silkworm is also an effective host for the production of recombinant proteins and biomaterials  <cit> . it is also an important model organism of the lepidoptera, the insect order that includes the majority of serious agricultural pests. therefore, the accumulation of silkworm genome resources will be helpful for both the control of agricultural pests and the development of the silkworm as an industrial-scale resource of biomaterials or bioreactors.

in silkworm, two individual whole-genome shotgun  projects have been carried out, and draft genomic sequences with 3× or  <dig> × coverage have been generated  <cit> . databases of expressed sequence tags  and a single nucleotide polymorphism linkage map have also been released  <cit> . bacterial artificial chromosomes   <cit> , as well as fosmids  <cit> , also constitute important genomic resources. the main advantage of bacs, compared with yeast artificial chromosomes  <cit>  or cosmids  <cit>  is their higher stability, simplicity of construction and screening, low frequency of chimeric clones, and ease of dna isolation. therefore, bacs are one of the main tools used for high-throughput genomic studies, including for sequence-tagged connector  strategies, bac-based physical maps, and dna fingerprinting, in various species  <cit> .

bac end sequences , single-pass sequence reads from each end of a bac clone, are a powerful tool that enhances the value of bacs as a genomic resource  <cit> . we conducted large-scale bac end-sequencing of two silkworm bac libraries, the rpci- <dig> bombyx mori silkworm p <dig> bac library  <cit>  and the texas a&m bac library  <cit> , and characterized  <dig> bess.

RESULTS
sequence coverage
two groups of bess were obtained, one from the ecori-digested bac library  and the other from the bamhi-digested bac library  . the total length of the two bes groups was approximately  <dig> mbp . given that the genome size of the silkworm is approximately  <dig> mbp  <cit> , the estimated sequence coverage of the ecori bess and bamhi bess was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. thus, by simple summation, the total sequence coverage was  <dig> %.

to calculate the percentage of the silkworm genome covered by the clones  in the ecori- and bamhi-digested libraries, we assumed that the silkworm genome size was  <dig> mb  <cit> . detailed information on the ecori-digested library, such as the size distribution of bac inserts, is available in the paper cited  <cit>  and at the rpci- <dig> bac library website  <cit> . detailed information on the bamhi-digested library can be obtained from the website of texas a&m bac libraries  <cit> .

a paired-end clone is a clone that contains both end sequences. the percentage of paired-end clones is the ratio of the number of paired-end clones to the total number of clones.

repeat analysis of bess
we estimated the transposable element  content of the two sets of bess. first, to construct a custom silkworm repeat database for use as a custom library file of the repeatmasker program  <cit> , we extracted silkworm repeat-related sequences enrolled in ncbi-genbank   <cit>  with a custom perl script. all completely redundant sequences in the library except for a single representative sequence were then removed. the number of tes in this library was  <dig>  to mask repetitive sequences from each bes, we used repeatmasker  with default settings. detailed information on the masked bases is provided in table  <dig>  the percentage of masked bases in the bamhi bes group  was higher than that in the ecori bes group . long interspersed nuclear elements  predominantly accounted for this difference. to explain this difference between the two bes groups, we examined the bias of the two restriction enzymes. the average interval of recognition sites of ecori and bamhi was  <dig>  and  <dig>  kbp, respectively, suggesting that in the silkworm genome ecori restriction sites were more abundant than bamhi restriction sites. in addition, we estimated the gc% of the silkworm protein coding region to be  <dig> %, based on silkworm protein coding sequences collected from genbank, whereas the reported overall gc content of the silkworm genome is  <dig> %  <cit> . therefore, the gc% of bamhi recognition sites  is closer to that of the protein coding regions than to that of the genome as a whole. conversely, the gc% of ecori recognition sites  is closer to that of the genome as a whole. these results suggest the gc bias between the two restriction enzymes may explain the difference in the abundance of tes between the two bes groups.

"elements" denotes the number of repeat elements detected. "percentage" denotes the ratio of length occupied by interspersed repeats to total length. gc content of unmasked region of ecori and bamhi bess were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. overall gc content of ecori and bamhi bess were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

to find novel repeat sequences in the bess, we analyzed the repeat-masked bess with recon   <cit> , which automatically identifies de novo repeats. only detected repeat families with  <dig> or more members were retained for further analysis. as a result,  <dig> and  <dig> repeat families with  <dig> or more members were detected in the ecori and bamhi bess, respectively. we then used blastx  <cit>  to compare each repeat sequence against the nr  database, and found that  <dig> % of the sequences had similarity to te-related proteins. we used representative sequences of the repeat families for a blast search of silkworm whole-genome shotgun  data  <cit>  to confirm whether they were really dispersed throughout the genome. the estimated copy number ranged from  <dig> to 2431; therefore, a large proportion of the detected sequences could be regarded as repetitive. however, a few sequences showed a much lower copy number than that estimated by recon. it was recently reported that the great majority of silkworm transposon insertions are 5' -truncated, so most of the detected repeat sequences may be ''transposon fossils'' with no activity  <cit> . further analysis of the detected sequences might reveal novel transposons in silkworm.

blast search against whole-genome shotgun data
all bess were used as queries in a blast similarity search of the two available sets of wgs data: the wgs data set deposited by the silkworm genomic research program  <cit>   and the data set deposited by the beijing genomics institute  <cit>  . in this search, the expectation value  was set to 1e- <dig> and the -b option  was set to  <dig> 

the percent identity distributions of blast hits  between the bess and the wgs data sets are summarized in fig.  <dig>  although, the percent identity of the blast hits ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  the majority of blast hits  showed ≥ 99% identity. moreover, the blast hits of ecori bess tended to have higher percent identity values than those of bamhi bess. this detected difference may reflect the higher abundance of repetitive sequences, which cause misassembly, in bamhi bess. the percent identity of blast hits against the sgp data also tended to be slightly higher than that against the bgi data. one possible cause of this difference may be strain divergence, because the bgi data were derived from an inbred domesticated silkworm variety, p <dig> , whereas the sgp data were from strain p50t , which diverged from p <dig> about  <dig> years ago and has been maintained at the university of tokyo. to estimate the sequence divergence between the two data sets, the common and unique sequences were extracted from the two repeat-masked wgs data sets by blast-searching between them . blast hits containing bases within  <dig> bp of either end of wgs contigs were removed because the quality of sequences near the end of contigs can be relatively low. the percent sequence divergence calculated was too low to determine whether it was polymorphism-derived, considering that the estimated sequence error of the sgp and bgi wgs contigs is  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively  <cit> . therefore, other factors such as sequencing errors in the wgs data sets might account for the difference in percent identity values between the two data sets.

we defined a match as a blast hit of ≥ 99% identity and ≥  <dig>  alignment coverage, which we defined as the ratio of alignment length to the bes length. the proportion of bess with at least one match  was greater with the bgi data than the sgp data. conversely, bess without matches  were more abundant with the sgp data. the number of bes-- sequences common to both wgs data sets in the ecori and bamhi bess was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. a blast search of bes-- sequences against ecoli.nt and vector databases revealed that  <dig> ecori and  <dig> bamhi bes-- sequences were contaminated sequences, probably as a result of incomplete automated sequence trimming. the majority of the remaining bes-- sequences  had no significant homology  in the nr or gss  databases, indicating that they might be gap region sequences or sequences extraordinarily amplified during polymerase chain reaction  process.

the majority of bess with a match were bes+, having only one match in each wgs data set. in addition, the percentage of ''multi-match'' ecori bess  was lower than that of multi-match bamhi bess. we inferred each bes+ to be a unique region-derived sequence, and bes++ to be likely derived from repetitive sequences. we defined ''unique paired-end clones'' as paired-end clones showing a single match at each bes. a blast search of sgp data using the bess as queries identified  <dig> unique paired-end clones in the ecori library and  <dig> among the bamhi bess. similarly, a blast search of the bgi data yielded  <dig> paired-end clones in the ecori bac library and  <dig> in the bamhi bac library. a total of  <dig> unique paired-end clones among the ecori bess, and  <dig> among the bamhi bess, were common to both wgs data sets.

bes clustering and coding region composition
we performed bes clustering, using "combined blast and phredphrap"  as described in methods, to examine bes composition in detail. sequence clustering of each group of bess was performed separately, using sequences of ≥  <dig> bp. the percentage of singletons among the ecori bess was higher than that among bamhi bess .

each representative sequence was then searched against the genbank nr database  to investigate the percentage of bess containing protein-coding regions. as a result,  <dig> clusters  of ecori bess had similarity to proteins in the database, compared with  <dig> clusters  of bamhi bess. for ecori bess, most of the hit proteins were from bombyx mori , anopheles gambiae , apis mellifera , drosophila melanogaster , or bos taurus , whereas in the case of bamhi bess, most of the hit proteins were from bombyx mori , anopheles gambiae , apis mellifera , drosophila melanogaster , or bos taurus . the majority of large clusters showed similarity to te-related proteins.

discussion
bamhi bess contained more repetitive sequences than ecori bess. in particular, the two groups of bess contrasted with regard to the abundance of lines. the gc bias of bamhi may be main factor accounting for this difference because the gc% of bamhi recognition sites was relatively close to the estimated gc% of protein coding dna of the silkworm genome. this inference is further supported by the fact that the lines in the repeat sequences library had bamhi recognition sites at average intervals of  <dig>  kbp, whereas the average interval between ecori recognition sites was  <dig>  kbp. these results indicate that the use of multiple bac libraries constructed with different restriction enzymes can increase the genome representation  <cit> .

the gc content of the masked region, especially the lines-derived region, was much higher than that of the unmasked region . conversely, the gc% of the dna transposons-derived region was similar to that of the coding region. to confirm the gc-richness of silkworm lines, we calculated the gc content of each type of transposable element in the repeat sequences library and found that the median gc content of dna-type elements , long terminal repeat  elements , lines , and short interspersed elements   was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. thus, the gc% of silkworm lines was rather higher than the estimated gc% of coding dna of 43%. these results suggest that the gc richness of transposable elements, especially that of lines, primarily accounted for the greater abundance of tes in the bamhi bess.

moreover, the gc richness of silkworm lines is notable because previous papers have reported that the at-rich region of the mammalian genome contains an increased density of line insertions and mammalian lines have a relatively low gc content  <cit> . in general, lines of insects, especially silkworm, have a much higher gc content than those of mammals . the gc richness of lines in silkworm might contribute toward the formation of specific genomic structures such as heterochromatin. a silkworm has a female heterogametic sex chromosome system , as do most species of lepidoptera. moreover, the structural features of lepidopteran sex chromosomes have recently been described; that is, the w chromosome possesses a block of heterochromatin, which may comprise a small or a large segment of the chromosome or even the entire w chromosome  <cit> . the presence of many repetitive dna elements in the w chromosome, especially non-ltr retrotransposons, has been reported  <cit> . these facts may suggest that silkworm lines are associated with the formation of heterochromatin. to further elucidate this possibility, analysis of more reliable genomic resources and cytogenetic methods is necessary.

the construction of a complete physical map is a vital task of genome sequencing projects. bess are useful for identifying minimally overlapping clones that extend in each direction from finished clones. unique paired-end clones are particularly useful for validating, ordering, and joining contigs. therefore, bacs and their end sequences can be effectively used for integration of linkage and physical maps  <cit> . however, the possibility of mismapping, mainly due to sequence contamination must be considered. a bac-based physical map can suffer from chimeric clones, genome assembly errors, and repetitive elements in the genome  <cit> . to reduce the incidence of incorrect mapping, tools such as repeat-masked bess and blast searching with stringent criteria are necessary. in addition, dna markers are helpful to detect incorrectly mapped clones. contigs with two markers from different linkage groups should be tested for clone contamination  <cit> . incorrect mapping can also be detectable as an inconsistency in the physical map when a deep coverage bac library is used. this blast-based analysis revealed that the majority of bess had blast hits with ≥ 99% identity against two available wgs data sets. moreover, the percent identity of blast hits against bgi data tended to be slightly lower than that against sgp data, although the main cause of this tendency could not be determined by our analysis. the estimated sequence divergence between the p50t and p <dig> strains was too low to determine whether the divergence was polymorphism-derived. therefore, merging of the two wgs data sets is reasonable and will contribute to the construction of a more useful genomic resource in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
characterization of bess from two bac libraries confirmed that bac libraries by nature tend to have certain biases. therefore, bess from multiple complementary bac libraries constructed with different restriction enzymes are a more useful genomic resource. the bess produced by this research constitute a valuable resource for genomic research in bombyx mori, for example, as a base for construction of a bac-based physical map and for exploration of dna makers. the genbank accession numbers of the obtained end sequences are de283657–de <dig>
