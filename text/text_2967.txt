BACKGROUND
plants have evolved complex strategies to adapt to their changing environments. light is among the most important environmental factors because it serves as the primary source of energy for photosynthesis. light is also a signaling cue that controls many aspects of plant growth and development, including seed germination, seedling de-etiolation, phototropism, shade avoidance, anthocyanin production and the induction of flowering  <cit> . several classes of photoreceptors evolved that constantly monitor light conditions and allow plants to rapidly respond to changing light conditions. these photoreceptors include the red- /far-red-  perceiving phytochromes, blue light -sensing cryptochromes, phototropins and the zeitlupe family and the uv-b receptor uvr <dig> .

arabidopsis seedlings grown in the dark display elongated hypocotyls, closed cotyledons and an apical hook. these etiolation phenotypes require the constitutively photomorphogenic1/suppressor of phya- <dig>  complex. hence, dark-grown cop <dig> mutants and spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> quadruple mutants exhibit constitutive de-etiolation, showing the phenotype of light-grown seedlings in darkness . the cop1/spa complex acts as a repressor of photomorphogenesis in the dark, while its repressor function is inhibited by light through multiple mechanisms. b-activated cryptochrome  <dig>  interacts with members of the spa family to disrupt the interaction between cop <dig> and spa proteins, leading to reduced cop1/spa function and de-etiolation of the plant  <cit> . similarly, phytochromes interrupt the cop1/spa interaction in red light  <cit> . for cry <dig>  cop1/spa function is reduced by the enhancement of the cry2-cop <dig> interaction due to cry2-spa interaction  <cit> . another mechanism that inactivates cop1/spa is based on the light-induced translocation of cop <dig> from the nucleus to the cytosol  <cit> . a third mechanism involves the light-induced degradation of spa <dig> and spa <dig>  <cit> .

the cop1/spa complex is part of the cullin <dig> -based multi-subunit e <dig> ubiquitin ligase cul4-ddb1cop1/spa  <cit> . the substrates of this e <dig> ligase include several transcription factors such as elongated hypocotyl  <dig> , long hypocotyl in fr  <dig>  and production of anthocyanin pigment  proteins which are responsible for light-induced photomorphogenesis . in the dark, these transcription factors are ubiquitinated by the cop1/spa-based e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, leading to their degradation in the 26s proteasome. when the cop1/spa complex is inhibited by photoreceptors in the light, these transcription factors are stabilized to facilitate their functions in activating the light responses.

cop <dig> contains an n-terminal ring-finger domain, a coiled-coil domain and c-terminal wd-repeats. the four spa proteins  are structurally related to cop <dig> in that they contain a coiled-coil domain and wd-repeats. however, the n-termini of cop <dig> and spas are distinct, with cop <dig> having a ring-finger domain and spas harboring a kinase-like domain  <cit> . cop <dig> and spas can form homo- and heterodimers via their respective coiled-coil domains and the cop1/spa complex forms a tetramer of two cop <dig> and two spa proteins. both cop <dig> and spa proteins can interact with most substrates and with ddb <dig> through their c-terminal wd-repeat domains . the function of the spa kinase-like domain, in contrast, is not well understood. it displays weak sequence similarity to ser/thr protein kinases, though many normally invariant amino acids are not conserved in the kinase-like domain of spa proteins, suggesting that spa proteins are pseudokinases  <cit> . deletion of the large n-terminus of spa <dig> including the kinase-like domain retained spa <dig> activity in light-grown transgenic spa <dig> mutant seedlings, suggesting that the n-terminus of spa <dig> is dispensable for spa <dig> function  <cit> . however, functional redundancy with spa <dig>  spa <dig> and spa <dig> might mask a need for the n-terminal domain. indeed, the n-terminus of spa <dig> was necessary for full spa <dig> activity in flowering time regulation  <cit> . the n-terminal domain of spa <dig> also de-stabilizes spa <dig> in light-grown seedlings  <cit> . protein-protein interaction studies have demonstrated that the n-terminal domain of spa <dig> is essential for binding cry <dig> in blue light and for binding phytochromes in red light  <cit> , though other domains of spa <dig> might also be involved in binding phytochromes  <cit> .

analysis of spa single, double and triple mutants showed that the four spa genes have overlapping but also distinct functions in plant development. in particular, spa <dig> and spa <dig> act redundantly to repress photomorphogenesis in seedlings in the dark, whereas in the light, only spa <dig> serves as a repressor to prevent overstimulation by light. spa <dig>  in contrast, is extremely effectively inactivated by light of even very low fluence rates. as a consequence, spa <dig> has little activity in light-grown plants when compared to spa <dig>  spa <dig> and spa <dig> . the molecular basis of the difference between spa <dig> and spa <dig> activity in light-grown seedlings was studied previously. chimeric spa1/spa <dig> promoter/cdna swap experiments have shown that the distinct functions of spa <dig> and spa <dig> genes in light-grown plants are due to differences in the respective protein sequences and independent of the spa promoter sequences. moreover, we found that the spa <dig> protein is more strongly degraded in the light than spa <dig> which correlates with the much stronger light-induced repression of spa <dig> activity when compared to the activity of spa <dig>  <cit> . here, we aimed to define the domain in the spa proteins which are responsible for the distinct activities and stabilities of spa <dig> and spa <dig> in light-grown seedlings. to this end, we expressed chimeric spa proteins containing domain swaps of spa <dig> and spa <dig> in transgenic spa mutant plants.

RESULTS
sequence divergence between the n-terminal domains of spa <dig> and spa <dig> is responsible and sufficient for the functional divergence between spa <dig> and spa <dig> in the light
we previously found that the diverged function of spa <dig> and spa <dig> genes in the light depends on differences in their protein-coding sequences  <cit> . in order to identify the domain responsible for the spa1- and spa2-specific activities of these spa proteins, we designed three domain swap constructs that encode chimeric spa proteins with an n-terminal domain, a coiled-coil domain or a wd-repeat domain from spa <dig> fused to the remaining domains of spa <dig>  the chimeric proteins thus contain one domain from spa <dig> and two domains from spa <dig> . they were expressed under the control of the spa <dig> promoter which is constitutively expressed and thus eliminates any transcriptional effects of light on protein function  <cit> . the chimeric constructs were transformed into the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant which exhibits constitutive photomorphogenesis in darkness.fig.  <dig> the n-terminal domain is involved in the functional divergence between spa <dig> and spa <dig>  a schematic representation of the chimeric spa1/spa <dig> domain-swap proteins ds_122-ha, ds_212-ha and ds_221-ha. “cc” represents the coiled-coil domain. all chimeric proteins were expressed in a spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant under the control of the spa <dig> promoter and fused with a c-terminal ha tag. numbers above the domains indicate the percent identical amino acids between spa <dig> and spa <dig>  nls indicates the site of a predicted nuclear localization sequence. b phenotype of 4-day-old spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant seedlings carrying the indicated domain-swap constructs. representative t <dig> seedlings are shown. seedlings expressing spa1-ha or spa2-ha served as controls. all proteins were expressed under the control of the spa <dig> promoter. seedlings were grown in darkness,  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> frc ,  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> rc  or  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> bc  for 4 days. numbers indicate independent transgenic lines. c quantification of hypocotyl length of 4-day-old ds_122-ha expressing spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> t <dig> homozygous seedlings grown under various fluence rates of frc, rc or bc. error bars represent the sem of at least  <dig> seedlings



dark-grown seedlings expressing any of the three chimeric spa1/spa <dig> proteins fully etiolated and thus exhibited full complementation of the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant phenotype . this was expected because spa <dig> and spa <dig> do not differ in their functions in darkness  <cit> . moreover, this shows that all three chimeric proteins are fully functional and thus not impaired by the domain swap. by contrast, transgenic light-grown seedlings revealed striking differences in phenotype. expression of the ds_122-ha chimeric protein harboring the n-terminal domain from spa <dig> complemented the phenotype of the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant to a similar extent as lines expressing spa1-ha under low fluence rate of frc, rc and bc . hence, swapping the n-terminal domain was sufficient to confer spa1-like activity to the spa <dig> protein. transgenic seedlings expressing ds_212-ha or ds_221-ha strongly deetiolated under weak frc, rc and bc and thus behaved similarly as the spa2-ha protein . these results indicate that the coiled-coil domain and the wd-repeat domain of spa <dig> are not sufficient to confer a spa1-like activity to an otherwise spa <dig> protein. in summary, the distinct functions of spa <dig> and spa <dig> in light-grown seedlings can be mapped to the respective n-terminal domain, while the coiled-coil domains and the wd-repeat domains are functionally similar and interchangeable between spa <dig> and spa <dig> 

based on these findings, we generated homozygous transgenic lines expressing the chimeric ds_122-ha protein and further characterized their responses to rc, frc and bc of different fluence rates. with increasing fluence rate of frc, rc and bc, seedlings of ds_122-ha-expressing spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> lines exhibited only a moderate reduction in hypocotyls length and thus behaved similarly to spa1-ha-expressing seedlings . in contrast, seedlings expressing spa2-ha responded to light with an extreme shortening of their hypocotyls. these transgenic seedlings deetiolated to a similar extent as the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> progenitor, indicating that there was no residual spa <dig> activity present in the light, as was reported previously  <cit> . these results confirm that the spa <dig> n-terminal domain is sufficient to maintain repressor activity in an otherwise spa <dig> protein in light-grown seedlings.

the divergent region of the n-terminal domain is responsible and sufficient for the functional divergence between spa <dig> and spa <dig> in the light
we subsequently aimed to narrow down the region in the n-terminal domain of spa <dig> and spa <dig> that is responsible for the divergence of spa <dig> and spa <dig> function in the light. based on sequence similarity, the n-termini of spa <dig> and spa <dig> were divided into two parts and swapped within the spa <dig> protein . the n-terminal part is very divergent between spa <dig> and spa <dig>  whereas the sequence of the c-terminal part is quite conserved among all four spa proteins from arabidopsis and also with spas from other species including physcomitrella. the latter also shows moderate sequence similarity with ser/thr protein kinases  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the diverged part of the n-terminal domain of spa contributes to the divergence of spa1/spa <dig> function in the light. a the top row shows a schematic representation of amino acid identity between spa <dig> and spa <dig> domains. below indicates the chimeric spa1/spa <dig> domain swap proteins ds_nt12-ha and ds_nt21-ha carrying swaps in the n-terminal domains of spa1/spa <dig>  all chimeric constructs were expressed in a spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant background under the control of the spa <dig> promoter and fused with a c-terminal ha tag. nls indicates the site of a predicted nuclear localization sequence. b, c phenotype of 4-day-old spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant seedlings expressing ds_nt12-ha or ds_nt21-ha swap constructs. representative t <dig> seedlings are shown. seedlings were grown in darkness or in  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> frc  and in  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> rc or  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> bc  for 4 days. numbers indicate independent transgenic lines



dark-grown spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant seedlings expressing chimeric ds_nt <dig> or ds_nt <dig> proteins displayed a fully etiolated phenotypes, indicating that the chimeric proteins complemented the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant phenotype and thus were fully functional similar to the non-chimeric spa <dig> and spa <dig> proteins . in frc, the transgenic seedlings displayed distinct phenotypes: the hypocotyl lengths of the ds_nt12-ha lines were similar to those of spa1-ha expressing lines, while the hypocotyl lengths of ds_nt21-ha lines were similar to those of spa2-ha expressing lines . similar results were obtained in rc and bc . these findings indicate that swapping the more diverged part of the n-terminal domain was sufficient to confer a spa1-like activity to the spa <dig> protein.

the wd-repeat domain can also contribute to the functional divergence between spa <dig> and spa <dig> in the light
after examining the domain swaps containing one domain from spa <dig> and two domains from spa <dig>  we conducted the reverse experiment by introducing one domain from spa <dig> into an otherwise spa <dig> protein . these chimeric proteins were also expressed under the control of the spa <dig> promoter in a spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant. all three constructs - ds_112-ha, ds_121-ha and ds_211-ha - complemented the seedling phenotype of the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant in the dark, again indicating that the domains from spa <dig> and spa <dig> are compatible with each other and that the chimeric proteins are fully functional in darkness . in the light, the phenotypes of the transgenic seedlings differed. frc-grown seedlings expressing ds_112-ha or ds_211-ha exhibited short hypocotyls and open cotyledons similar to the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> progenitor and spa2-ha-expressing spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> seedlings, indicating that these chimeric proteins, like spa <dig>  retain barely any activity in the light. similar results were obtained in rc and - to a lesser extent, in bc . in contrast, seedlings expressing ds_121-ha showed strong etiolation and behaved similar to the spa1-ha protein . hence, swapping the coiled-coil domain from spa <dig> into the spa <dig> protein did not alter spa <dig> activity. a similar observation was made previously when introducing the coiled-coil domain from spa <dig> into spa <dig>  <cit> . hence, the coiled-coil domains from spa <dig> and spa <dig> appear equivalent.fig.  <dig> wd-repeat domain is involved in the functional divergence of spa <dig> and spa <dig>  a schematic representation of chimeric spa1/spa <dig> domain swap ds_112-ha, ds_121-ha and ds_211-ha constructs. all chimeric constructs were expressed in a spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant background under the control of the spa <dig> promoter and fused with a c-terminal ha tag. nls indicates the location of a predicted nuclear localization sequence. b phenotype of 4-day-old spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> seedlings expressing ds_112-ha, ds_121-ha and ds_211-ha domain swap constructs. representative t <dig> seedlings are shown. seedlings were grown in darkness or in  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> frc,  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> rc or  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> bc for 4 days. numbers indicate independent transgenic lines



taken together, these results indicate that both the n-terminal domain and the wd-repeat domain of spa <dig> can confer spa2-like function to an otherwise spa <dig> protein. hence, both the n-terminal domain and the wd-repeat domain, but not the coiled-coil domain, can play a role in the distinct functions of spa <dig> and spa <dig> 

the n-terminal domains of spa <dig> and spa <dig> differentially regulate spa protein stability
our previous studies showed that the spa <dig> protein is more rapidly degraded in the light when compared to the spa <dig> protein  <cit> . we therefore used domain swap lines to test which domains contribute to the differential protein stability of spa <dig> and spa <dig>  ds_122-ha protein levels changed only moderately upon irradiation of dark-grown seedlings with frc, rc or bc . similarly, the spa1-ha protein was relatively stable after this short exposure to light, while the spa2-ha protein was fully degraded upon light exposure, as reported previously  <cit> . hence, the ds_122-ha protein behaved similarly to the spa <dig> protein, indicating that the n-terminal domain of spa <dig> stabilizes the chimeric ds_122-ha protein in the light.fig.  <dig> the spa <dig> n-terminal domain provides the higher stability to the chimeric ds_122-ha protein in the light. a-c spa-ha protein levels in 4-day-old t <dig> homozygous transgenic spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant seedlings grown in darkness  and subsequently transferred to  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> fr ,  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> r  or  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> b  for 30 min. spa-ha was detected using an α–ha antibody. hsc <dig> levels served as a loading control. numbers indicate independent transgenic lines



levels of the ds_212-ha protein harboring the coiled-coil domain of spa <dig> in a spa <dig> background strongly decreased in response to light . this demonstrates that the coiled-coil domains of spa <dig> and spa <dig> are functionally equivalent with respect to protein stability. the levels of ds_221-ha harboring the wd-repeat domain of spa <dig> in a spa <dig> background strongly decreased in response to light, suggesting that the wd-repeats of spa <dig> and spa <dig> also do not severely differ in their effects on protein stability in this configuration . in summary, only a swap-in of the spa <dig> n-terminal domain can confer higher stability to a spa <dig> protein in the light.

when conducting the reverse experiment, i.e. swapping a spa <dig> domain into a spa <dig> protein, the n-terminal domain of spa <dig> de-stabilized the spa <dig> protein in light-grown ds_211-ha lines when compared to spa1-ha lines . swapping the coiled-coil domain did not dramatically alter protein stability in two out of three lines , while swapping the wd-repeat domain tended to destabilize the protein . hence, in an otherwise spa <dig> protein, introducing the n-terminal or the wd-repeat domain of spa <dig> strongly or moderately destabilized the chimeric protein, respectively.

spa <dig> and spa <dig> have similar affinities for cry <dig> in blue light
since spa <dig> is much more strongly inactivated by blue light than spa <dig>  <cit>  we tested whether spa <dig> might interact with cry <dig> more strongly than spa <dig>  figure 5a shows that spa <dig> and spa <dig> have similar affinities for cry <dig> in vivo. this suggest that the higher responsiveness of spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutants to blue light when compared to spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutants  <cit>  is not due to a differential cry <dig> binding strength. this finding is consistent with our previous observation that inactivation of spa <dig> is primarily mediated by phya  <cit> .fig.  <dig> ds_122-ha associates with cry <dig> and cry <dig> in blue light. a, b co-immunoprecipitation of cry <dig>  and cry <dig>  by ds_122-ha. 4-day-old dark-grown seedlings  were transferred to 50 μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> b for 1 h . ds-122-ha was expressed in spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> and under the control of the spa <dig> promoter. col- <dig>  spa2::spa1-ha and spa1::spa2-ha lines were used as controls. spa-ha proteins were immunoprecipitated using α-ha beads. α-ha antibody was used to detect spa-ha proteins. α-cry <dig> and α-cry <dig> antibodies were used to detect cry <dig> and cry <dig>  respectively. asterisks likely indicate phosphorylated cry <dig> and cry <dig>  to obtain similar spa-ha protein levels from different transgenic lines in b, all seedlings were treated with proteasome inhibitor to reduce protein degradation in b. also, spa2-ha was expressed under the control of the stronger spa <dig> promoter to counteract the strong b-induced degradation of spa <dig>  five times more protein extract was used for the spa1::spa2-ha  <dig> and ds_122-ha  <dig> co-immunoprecipitations than for the spa2::spa1-ha  <dig> and ds_122-ha  <dig> co-immunoprecipitations



the n-termini of spa <dig> and spa <dig> differentially interact with cry2
we previously showed that spa <dig> does not bind cry <dig> in vivo, while spa <dig> does interact with cry <dig> in vivo, as was shown previously  <cit> . we therefore asked whether swapping of the spa <dig> n-terminal domain into spa <dig> blocked the interaction between the chimeric spa protein and cry <dig>  figure 5b shows that the ds_122-ha chimeric protein was able to associate with cry <dig> in b, while spa2-ha was not. hence, the differential affinity of spa <dig> and spa <dig> for cry <dig> is due to the distinct sequences in their n-terminal domains.

spa <dig> and spa <dig> similarly interact with cop <dig> in light-grown seedlings
we subsequently asked whether light is more effective in disrupting a cop1/spa <dig> complex when compared to a cop1/spa <dig> complex. spa <dig> and spa <dig> co-immunoprecipitated the same amount of cop <dig> in dark- and light-grown seedlings . hence, no differential effect of light on cop1/spa <dig> and cop1/spa <dig> complex abundance was observed.fig.  <dig> spa <dig> and spa <dig> similarly interact with cop <dig> in dark-grown vs. light-grown seedlings. co-immunoprecipitation of cop <dig> by spa1-ha and spa2-ha in the 4-day-old spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> seedlings expressing spa1-ha and spa2-ha proteins under the control of the native spa <dig> promoter. seedlings were grown in darkness and were subsequently transferred to  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> fr or r for 2 h or 50 μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> b for 1 h. proteasome inhibitor was added to prevent degradation of spa proteins in blue light. spa1-ha and spa2-ha proteins were immunoprecipitated using α-ha beads. col- <dig> was used as a negative control. α-ha antibody was used to detect spa-ha proteins. α-cop <dig> antibody was used to detected cop <dig>  equal amount of total protein was used as inputs



discussion
the cop1/spa protein complex is an important negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in dark-grown arabidopsis plants. our previous analysis of spa genes revealed that the four spas have at least partially distinct functions during plant growth and development. in particular, spa <dig> and spa <dig> proteins strongly differ in their responsiveness to light, while they have indistinguishable activities in darkness. in light-grown seedlings, spa <dig> retains considerable repressor activity to prevent overstimulation by light, while spa <dig> is almost fully inactivated by even very low fluences of light  <cit> . here, we have shown that the stronger light-responsiveness of spa <dig> when compared to spa <dig> maps primarily to the n-terminal domain which includes the kinase-like domain. this conclusion is based on our finding that swapping the n-terminal domain of spa <dig> into a spa <dig> protein confers spa1-like responsiveness to r, fr and b in the chimeric protein. the same result was found when conducting the reverse experiment, i.e. when introducing the n-terminus of spa <dig> into an otherwise spa <dig> protein. this finding is consistent with the observation that sequence divergence between spa <dig> and spa <dig> is highest in the n-terminal domain  when compared to the wd-repeat domain  and the coiled-coil domain . when we further divided the n-terminal domain into a smaller, highly conserved part and a larger, not conserved part, we found that the non-conserved part of spa <dig> and spa <dig> conferred the spa1- or spa2-specific light-responsiveness, respectively. hence, these specific spa activities that map to the n-terminal domain evolved through major sequence alterations and not through smaller sequence changes in a highly conserved domain. it remains to be established which of the two spa genes, spa <dig> or spa <dig>  evolved a new activity since the duplication event leading to spa <dig> and spa <dig>  <cit> . since spa <dig> and spa <dig> respond to light similarly to spa <dig>  it is likely that the extreme light-induced inhibition of spa <dig> is the recent evolutionary innovation.

though the n-terminal domain is the primary domain responsible for the distinct activities of spa <dig> and spa <dig> in light-grown seedlings, the wd-repeat domain can also contribute at least to some extent to the functional divergence between spa <dig> and spa <dig>  we found that swapping the wd-repeat domain from spa <dig> into a spa <dig> protein also strongly enhanced light-responsiveness of the chimeric protein. however, the reverse experiment, i.e. introducing the wd-repeat from spa <dig> into a spa <dig> protein did not reduce light-responsiveness. hence, the spa-specific effect of the wd-repeat might be context-dependent. however, it is also possible that the enhanced light-induced inactivation of this chimeric ds_ <dig> protein is due to a partial loss-of-function caused by the domain swap per se. this partial loss-of function might only be detectable in light-grown seedlings, while the activity of the chimeric protein might be sufficient for full suppression of photomorphogenesis in darkness. indeed, such a phenotype was observed in the non-constitutively photomorphogenic cop1eid <dig> mutant  <cit> . moreover, it is known that spa activities are more limiting in light-grown seedlings than in dark-grown seedlings since spa single mutants exhibit a mutant phenotype only in the light  <cit> . in total, we therefore conclude that the functional divergence between spa <dig> and spa <dig> primarily maps to the divergent part of the n-terminal domain.

we considered at least two, not mutually exclusive mechanisms that might contribute to the distinct light-responsiveness of spa <dig> and spa <dig> proteins. first, the n-termini of spa <dig> and spa <dig> might have distinct affinities for photoreceptors. there is no evidence that differences in the interactions with cryptochromes might be causal for the higher light-responsiveness of spa <dig>  our results show that spa <dig> and spa <dig> interacted similarly with cry <dig> in b. with respect to cry <dig>  spa <dig> has a severely reduced - rather than increased - affinity for cry <dig> when compared to spa <dig>  <cit> . similarly, we have shown here that the n-terminal domain swap protein ds_ <dig> conferring a lower responsiveness to light exhibits a restored interaction with cry <dig> when compared to spa <dig>  the relative in vivo affinities of spa <dig> and spa <dig> for phytochromes are thus far unknown. it is known, however, that the n-terminal domain of spa <dig> which is responsible for the distinct functions of spa <dig> and spa <dig> interacts with phya in the yeast-two hybrid system  <cit> . also, phytochromes are the primary photoreceptors inactivating spa <dig> in r, fr as well as b  <cit> . on the other hand, spa <dig> interacted less with phya in r-treated yeast cells when compared with spa <dig>  <cit> . hence, further experiments are necessary to resolve whether differential interactions of spa <dig> and spa <dig> with phytochromes contribute to the distinct light-responsiveness of spa <dig> and spa <dig> 

even if affinities for the photoreceptors themselves do not account for the functional divergence of spa <dig> and spa <dig>  downstream effects in repressing cop1/spa <dig> and cop1/spa <dig> function by photoreceptors may differ and be causative for the distinct light-responsiveness of spa <dig> and spa <dig>  one mechanism by which light inactivates cop1/spa <dig> and cop1/spa <dig> function is the phytochrome-induced degradation of spa <dig> and spa <dig>  indeed, spa <dig> is much more effectively degraded in the light than spa <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the degree of photomorphogenesis in transgenic lines expressing chimeric spa1/spa <dig> proteins was negatively correlated with the stability of the chimeric proteins in the light, i.e. highly responsive lines expressed a chimeric protein that is unstable in the light, and vice versa. this correlation supports the notion that light-induced spa protein degradation is intrinsically related to the light-induced inhibition of cop1/spa activity. our finding that a swap of the spa1/spa <dig> n-terminal domains strongly alters the stability of the chimeric spa proteins also agrees with previous observations showing that the n-terminal domain of spa <dig> de-stabilizes the spa <dig> protein  <cit> . light inactivates cop1/spa function also by dissociation of the cop1/spa interaction and by nuclear exclusion of cop <dig>  <cit> . hence, one can hypothesize that the light-induced dissociation of a cop1/spa <dig> complex might be more sensitive to light than the dissociation of a cop1/spa <dig> complex, and this difference might depend on the n-terminal sequence in spa. our results do not provide evidence for this idea because both spa <dig> and spa <dig> were in a complex with cop <dig> also in light-treated seedlings. however, since the light-induced disruption of the cop1/spa complex is much less detectable in co-immunoprecipitation assays than in yeast three-hybrid or fret-flim studies , other assays may be necessary to compare the light-induced rearranging in the respective cop1/spa complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results have defined the n-terminal domains of spa <dig> and spa <dig> as a "light-sensitivity" domain that confers the distinct light-responsiveness to the respective spa protein regarding light-induced photomorphogenesis and light-induced spa degradation. the exact mechanism in which the n-terminal domain is involved and which role photoreceptors play remain to be resolved.
