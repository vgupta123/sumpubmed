BACKGROUND
coat colours in mammals depend on skin and hair pigment synthesis. melanocytes manufacture two types of melanin: the black/brown photo-protective eumelanin pigment, and the red-yellow cytotoxic phaeomelanin pigment. several paracrine factors secreted primarily by surrounding keratinocytes are involved in the melanogenic pathway by stimulating the switch between phaeomelanin and eumelanin  <cit> . in this pathway, microphthalmia transcription factor  plays a central role by regulating the expression of the tyr , trp- <dig>  and dct  genes that encode enzymes involved in pigment manufacture  <cit> .

coat colour is highly polymorphic in dogs. in  <dig>  little described, after observing the possible phenotypes, more than  <dig> loci affecting coat colours  <cit> . until recently, only a few genes were recognised as involved in pigmentation. however, more and more genes, alleles and new interactions are being discovered: variants of melanocortine  <dig> receptor gene ,   <cit> , variants of agouti, the antagonist ligand of mc1r  <cit> , variants of tyrosinase-related protein  <dig>   <cit>  and variants of melanophillin  <cit> . three mutations responsible for the brown coat colour versus black coat colour were described in tyrp <dig> in several dog breeds including the australian shepherd dog  <cit> . genomic tools are now fully available in canine genetics: dense radiation hybrid maps with  <dig> polymorphic microsatellite markers and anchored bac markers  <cit> , a radiation hybrid map comprising  <dig>  canine gene-based markers  <cit> , and a whole sequence assembly of the canine genome, build  <dig>   <cit> . altogether, the dog appears to be a good model for understanding better the genetics of pigmentation in mammals and for isolating new genes, new variants and interactions between alleles of different loci.

we are interested in the merle phenotype because of its involvement in coat colour and developmental impairments. the merle phenotype is a dominant trait, with heterozygous dogs presenting a coat colour in which eumelanic regions are incompletely and irregularly diluted, leaving intensely pigmented patches. merle is found throughout the body except on the pheomelanic regions of the black and tan coat colour . these dogs often have heterochromia iridis or blue eyes and often have a lack of retinal pigment visible on the fundus. homozygous merle dogs display a more severe phenotype. the dogs are usually very pale, sometimes completely white and present developmental defects with an incomplete penetrance, microphthalmia and hearing loss . in merle european lineages, microphthalmia and/or hearing loss are not frequently observed as breeders avoid mating merle dogs to avoid these developmental defects. however, several veterinary studies on the "merle syndrome", reported retinal defects  <cit> , microphthalmia and coloboma  <cit> . the non-survival or degeneration of melanocytes in the cochlea have been suggested to explain hearing loss  <cit> .

when analysing the genetic basis of the merle phenotype, little suggested that a unique locus  was responsible for the merle phenotype in different breeds  <cit> . it was proposed that the merle coat colour may be due to a transposable element, after the observation of two germinal reversions out of  <dig> merle offspring of a homozygous merle female  <cit> . recently, the kit ligand, kitlg, was excluded as a candidate gene for the merle phenotype in dogs  <cit>  and the candidate gene approach has not yet give any conclusive results.

we searched for candidate genes for the merle phenotype in dogs by considering well-described pigment disorders in mice. mutations in the gene of the mitf pathway cause specific coat colour phenotypes, some of which are similar to the merle phenotype in dogs. these include dilution of the coat colour in patches and complete or mild microphthalmia . also, the complete abolition of functional mitf results in loss of the melanocyte lineage, causing a white coat colour due to a lack of pigment cell manufacturer, and additional eye  and inner ear disorders. heteroallelic combinations of mitf variants produce animals with normal sized dark eyes and yellowish-brown to grey spotted checker board-like coat colours  <cit> . mitf is also involved in human waardenburg syndromes, including pigment cell migration disorders  <cit>  and developmental defects such as deafness. pax <dig>  and sox <dig> , which regulates mitf gene expression, are also associated with this syndrome  <cit> . this genetic evidence suggest that mitf, pax <dig> and sox <dig> genes may be candidate genes for the merle phenotype.

we collected a pedigree of australian shepherd dogs and used a genetic linkage approach with microsatellite markers flanking the mitf, pax <dig> and sox <dig> candidate genes to search for the genetic bases of the merle coat colour in canines. although these three genes were excluded for the merle phenotype in dogs, we successfully identified the merle locus on canine chromosome  <dig>  close to the centromere,  <dig> mb away from sox <dig>  this locus was restricted to a  <dig>  mb interval and was further confirmed by analysing families of other breeds segregating the merle phenotype.

RESULTS
pedigrees
a pedigree comprising  <dig> australian shepherd dogs  was collected. this pedigree, called the "complete pedigree", included  <dig> merle dogs. a sub-pedigree of  <dig> dogs, including  <dig> merle dogs, derived from the complete pedigree was used for genotyping . isolated families from different breeds segregating the merle coat colour were also collected, including three dachshund families ; a beauce shepherd family  and a border collie family .

genetic linkage analysis of the brown coat colour in the pedigrees
we evaluated the linkage power of the pedigrees by investigating the genetic linkage between the brown phenotype and the tyrp <dig> gene in the complete pedigree. as the tyrp <dig> gene was previously associated with the brown coat colour in dogs  <cit> , we genotyped markers linked to tyrp <dig>  these markers, fh <dig> and ren105i <dig>  are  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb from tyrp <dig>  respectively . the lod scores between the brown phenotype and fh <dig> and ren105i <dig> markers obtained by a two-point analysis on the complete pedigree, were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, with a recombination fraction of θ =  <dig>  for the sub-pedigree, the lod scores were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively at θ =  <dig>  the number of informative meiosis for the brown phenotype was  <dig> in the complete pedigree and  <dig> in the sub-pedigree. as the number of informative meiosis for the merle phenotype significantly increased to  <dig> and  <dig> in the complete pedigree and sub-pedigree, respectively, we expected these present pedigrees to be valuable for linkage analysis of the merle phenotype.

genetic linkage analysis of the merle trait
as expected, the transmission mode in the collected pedigrees was consistent with an autosomal dominant segregation of the merle phenotype.

using the sub-pedigree, we carried out genetic linkage analysis on polymorphic markers either flanking or within the intronic part of tyrp <dig> gene and the candidate genes mitf, pax <dig>  and sox  <dig>  two-point analysis showed no significant linkage between the merle phenotype and markers flanking the mitf and pax <dig> genes . therefore, we could exclude mitf and pax <dig> being involved in this phenotype. however, we found significant linkages  with markers flanking sox <dig>  with recombination fractions, θ, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . this suggested that the merle locus was about  <dig> cm from sox <dig>  as part of a "chromosome walking strategy", we selected  <dig> new polymorphic markers spanning a  <dig> mb region from the sox <dig> region to the centromeric tip of cfa <dig>  as the c <dig>  marker telomeric to sox <dig> had a decreasing lod score .

linkage analysis allowed us to identify seven markers close to the centromere, cfa <dig>  to cfa <dig> , which cosegregate with the merle phenotype with significant lod scores  .

we extended the genetic linkage by analysing the nine most centromeric markers in the "complete pedigree" and in three nuclear families of dachshund, beauce shepherd and border collie segregating the merle phenotype. we obtained increased lod scores for markers cfa <dig>  to cfa <dig> , with maximum lod scores for cfa <dig>  and cfa <dig>  . the cfa <dig>  marker  is unlinked to the phenotype . haplotype analyses of this region allowed us to detect a recombination event between the merle phenotype and the cfa <dig>  microsatellite, thus limiting further the merle locus . these data, as well as the previous results for sox <dig> flanking markers , allowed us to exclude the sox <dig> gene as being involved in the merle phenotype. our results show that the merle locus is located in a  <dig>  mb region between the end of the centromere, arbitrarily located at  <dig> mb,  and the cfa <dig>  marker  defining the telomeric limit of the critical interval .

discussion
in the present study, we used a genetic linkage approach on a pedigree of australian shepherd dogs segregating the merle phenotype. we identified with high statistical support a  <dig>  mb locus at the centromeric tip of cfa <dig> in which the gene responsible for this phenotype should be found. dog samples were collected from breeders. as phenotyping was easily and immediately detectable after birth by breeders themselves and then officially declared to the breed club, we have been able to obtain an informative family with as many as five generations of australian shepherd dogs. moreover, parentage testing ensured good reliability of the pedigrees. such collected pedigrees from existing families means that housing of dogs is not required, limiting housing costs and ethical issues.

we focused on three candidate genes belonging to the coat colour pathway: mitf, pax <dig> and sox  <dig>  the merle phenotype shares similarities with mitf mouse mutants in coat colour and ocular and hearing defects, and also with human waardenburg patients. however, our genetic linkage study ruled out these three genes as being involved in the merle phenotype. genetic analysis of the sox <dig> region in the sub-pedigree, using a "chromosome walking" strategy on cfa <dig>  allowed us to identify the merle locus. it spans a  <dig>  mb region  <dig> mb away from sox <dig>  genetic linkage analyses on the complete pedigree and on small families from other breeds confirmed that the merle locus was located between the cfa <dig> centromere  and the cfa <dig>  marker , with the highest lod score of  <dig> .

the corresponding orthologous human region is hsa12q13-q <dig>  and mouse region is mmu10d <dig> . these orthologous dog, human and mouse regions correspond to a unique conserved ordered segment, which has the same orientation in dogs and humans but is inverted between dogs and mice. in the dog region,  <dig> genes are predicted and  <dig> are known , in the human region,  <dig> genes are predicted and  <dig> are known , and in the mouse region,  <dig> genes are predicted and  <dig> are known   <cit> . these gene numbers may vary due to slight changes in the annotated genes as the versions are updated. in humans, mice and dogs, the conserved segments are totally ordered, making annotation of the dog segment easy, thus helping determination of candidate merle genes. this locus has many candidate genes, with at least a dozen being potential metabolic candidates as they, or their paralogs, belong to the pigmentation pathway. these include proteins involved in neural crest development , melanosome motility and transfer to surrounding keratinocytes .

although the mitf gene itself has been excluded, the merle mutation should affect a gene interacting directly with the mitf gene in the pigmentation pathway. alternatively, a more complex mechanism could explain the incomplete penetrance of eye defects observed in homozygous merle dogs. although hearing loss may be due to an extreme white phenotype, including the absence of melanocytes in the cochlea, as in other white canine breeds  <cit> , less is known about the origins of microphthalmia and other ocular defects. these may be due to another mutation in the same locus.

the merle phenotype occurs in several breeds and is commonly encountered in mongrel dogs. breeds segregating merle are from the collie lineage : shetland sheepdog, border collie, collie, australian shepherd dog, etc., and from other unrelated breeds belonging to different fci groups and different clusters, as defined by parker et al.  <cit> , such as dachshund :, beauce shepherd , great dane , welsh corgi cardigan and pyrenean shepherd. the merle phenotype is most probably very old, with the merle coat colour being reported in old books  <cit> , from which drawings of merle dogs have been selected and reproduced  <cit> .

it is not yet known whether the genetic cause of the merle phenotype is the same in all breeds and mongrels segregating this phenotype. a unique locus has been suggested as responsible for the merle coat colour  <cit> . in the present study, the increased lod scores observed for genotyped markers from the merle locus in dachshund, beauce shepherd and border collie families is consistent, at least in these breeds, with there being a unique locus for the merle coat colour. if all merle dogs share a common ancestor chromosome, all breeds segregating merle could be used to refine the locus. the sharing of the merle locus by several breeds and also by mongrels may be due either to a common ancestor chromosome region being transmitted throughout canine evolution and/or to backcrosses that introduced a merle haplotype in several breeds at different times.

CONCLUSIONS
using genetic linkage analysis, we excluded the involvement of the mitf, pax <dig> and sox  <dig> candidates genes in the merle phenotype. however, we identified the merle locus at the centromeric end of cfa <dig> in pedigrees of australian shepherd dogs, dachshund, beauce shepherd dogs and border collies segregating the merle phenotype. this locus spans  <dig>  mb and is linked to the merle coat colour with a maximum lod score of  <dig>  and a recombination fraction of  <dig>  we are currently analysing this locus in several breeds segregating merle, with a high density of single nucleotide polymorphic markers . this should help in identifying the merle gene. as well as benefiting breeding practices and canine veterinary medicine, identifying the merle gene will also help in understanding the genetic bases of mammalian pigmentation and developmental pathways.
