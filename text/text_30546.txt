BACKGROUND
programmed cell death is a gene-guided process for the elimination of unnecessary or harmful cells in which the cysteine proteases caspases are core elements  <cit> . to date,  <dig> members of this family have been identified in the human genome  <cit> , caspase- <dig> to caspase- <dig>  and caspase- <dig>  they can be divided, with respect to function, into two major groups. the first, including the initiator caspases  and the effector caspases , lead directly to apoptosis  <cit> , while the others, including caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  are involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . caspase- <dig> is mainly expressed in the epidermis and takes part in epidermal barrier formation  <cit> .

in vertebrate cells, the apoptotic response is mediated through either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. the intrinsic pathway is triggered by death stimuli generated within the cell, such as dna damage, leading to the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which associates with caspase- <dig> and apoptotic protease activating factor  <dig>  to form an apoptosome  <cit> . the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by the binding of extracellular death ligands to death receptors , such as fasl binding to fas. as members of the tnf receptor  superfamily, the drs further recruit the cytosolic adaptor fas-associated death domain , which interacts with procaspase- <dig> through death effector domains  to form an oligomeric death-inducing signaling complex  <cit> . the activated caspase- <dig> released subsequently cleaves the effector caspase- <dig>  which finally executes apoptosis  <cit> . in addition to apoptosis, caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> are also involved in non-apoptotic functions. in the development of the yolk sac vasculature during mouse embryogenesis, caspase- <dig> restricts the rip3-dependent pathway rather than apoptosis  <cit> , and caspase- <dig> is required for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> .

another major cellular program mediated by caspases is cytokine processing  <cit> . in mammals, these caspases are distinctive due to having a caspase recruitment domain  at the n-terminal. caspase- <dig> is the most documented of these. caspase- <dig> activity is regulated by the nucleotide olimerization domain-like receptor  family members through inflammasome formation. these multiprotein complex formations usually require the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein , which contains an n-terminal pyrin domain  interacting with that of the nlr along with a c-terminal card with caspase- <dig>  the activated caspase- <dig> controls maturation of interleukins such as il-1Î² and il- <dig>  which direct a wide variety of effects related to innate immunity and host responses  <cit> .

homologs of the three proteins, ced- <dig>  ced- <dig>  and ced- <dig> , which were first identified as being involved in apoptosis in nematodes, are found in the genomes of all animals and associated with apoptosis signaling  <cit> . it is logical to expect that an apoptotic regulatory network composed of bcl- <dig>  apaf- <dig> and caspase had already been established in protostomes and was conserved to evolve into the intrinsic pathway in deuterostomes. however, cytochrome c binding has not been recognized for ced- <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans, and drosophila apaf- <dig> homolog, dark still remains controversial  <cit> . moreover, although a dfadd and a tnfr have been described, such ancient tnfr lacks the death domain  and does not recruit the dfadd  <cit> , suggesting that the functional extrinsic apoptotic pathway does not exist in drosophila. in addition, the inflammasome related caspases have been reported only in vertebrates. however, with the annotation of amphioxus immune related genes, an expanded caspase family has been identified in which many genes related to the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, and some novel genes related to inflammation, were identified. thus, further functional analysis of the amphioxus caspase family will help to clarify whether the caspase-mediated extrinsic apoptosis and the caspase-dependent innate immune complex were completely formed, and what their unique features are, at the basal chordate stage.

RESULTS
analysis of three caspase genes with death-fold domains in amphioxus
our previous annotation reported that, due to the domain recombination and shuffling at the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates, the amphioxus genome contains at least  <dig> caspase genes  <cit> , including  <dig> genes related to both caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>   <dig> to caspase-8/ <dig>  five to caspase-3/6/ <dig>  and seven to unknown caspase genes. based on genomic analysis, from each of the known branches above we chose one caspase with a conserved domain and two with novel domain architecture for further analysis. these were bbtcaspase- <dig>  which is the ortholog of caspase- <dig> with conserved protein architecture, bbtcaspase-1/ <dig>  which shares the greatest similarity with caspase- <dig>  but its prodomain contains a ded and a dd instead of a card in mammalian caspase- <dig>  and finally bbtcaspase3-like, which is 33% homologous to the human caspase-3/ <dig> caspase domain .

to obtain clues to the functions of distinct caspases, we performed quantitative real-time pcr to detect their tissue distribution  and responses to infection. the transcripts of all characterized caspases, especially bbtcaspase-1/ <dig>  were abundant in the hepatic cecum, gill and gut. since the hepatic cecum and gut are considered as the first line of the amphioxus immune defense system, we proposed that the caspase family should play important roles in amphioxus immunity. in response to staphylococcus aureus and vibrio vulnificus challenges, the transcripts of bbtcaspase- <dig>  but not of bbtcaspase3-like or bbtcaspase-1/ <dig>  were upregulated dramatically . the distinct expression patterns of caspases may suggest their diverse functions in amphioxus immunity or other roles.

structure and function conservation of bbtcaspase- <dig> in apoptosis
bbtcaspase- <dig> exhibits similar protein structure to its vertebrate counterparts, including a pair of deds in the prodomain and a c-terminal caspase domain . to compare its function to that of human caspase, full-length and several truncated versions of bbtcaspase- <dig> were fused with gfp for cell localization analyses. when expressed in hela cells, bbtcaspase-8-gfp protein was localized unevenly in the cytoplasm. the truncated mutant containing only the prodomain  was shown to have death effector filamentous structures   <cit>  around the nucleus to promote cell death . the prodomain  of bbtcaspase- <dig> co-localizes with bbtfadd <dig>  but not with bbtfadd <dig> . these results were in agreement with our previous report that, in hela cells, bbtfadd <dig> is expressed in the cytoplasm, while bbtfadd <dig> is restricted to the nucleus  <cit> . to determine if bbtcaspase- <dig> can induce apoptosis when overexpressed, we investigated the binding activity of bbtcaspase- <dig> transfected hela cells with annexin v, which is an early hallmark of apoptosis  <cit> . we found that full-length bbtcaspase- <dig> and two truncated mutants can induce apparent apoptosis, and that the apoptosis induced by full-length bbtcaspase- <dig> can be inhibited by the caspase- <dig> inhibitor z-ietd-fmk . in addition, the caspase- <dig> activity in the transfected hela cell is  <dig>  to 2-fold that of the negative control . the sequence comparison of catalytic domain between bbtcaspase- <dig> and human caspase- <dig> indicated that these two amino acid sequences share more than 50% similarities . these results suggest that bbtcaspase- <dig> has substrate specificity similar to human caspase- <dig>  thus, we propose that bbtcaspase- <dig> can induce apoptosis through a direct ded-mediated interaction with bbtfadd <dig>  <cit>  resulting in the cleavage of bbtcaspase- <dig> via the conservative catalytic site sequence qacqg.

a ded-containing nuclear caspase can induce mammalian cell apoptosis
compared to the initiator caspases and interleukin-converting enzyme  -like caspases, the bbtcaspase3-like caspase domain is more similar to the effector caspases, caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  in spite of its ded-containing prodomain that is not linked to the reported effector caspases . unlike mammalian caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  which are mainly present in cytoplasm  <cit> , the fusion protein bbtcaspase3-like-gfp is expressed only in the nucleus of hela cells, and this localization is not required for the prodomain ded . with a conserved active site, cys <dig>  within the catalytic motif qscrg  <cit> , the full length bbtcaspase3-like and the truncated mutant c3- <dig> lacking the prodomain were shown to promote cell death in transfected hela cells, in which increased caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> activities were also detected . the apoptosis processes were further confirmed by visually observable apoptotic morphology and annexin v binding assays . however, apoptosis was not completely inhibited by the caspase- <dig> inhibitor z-devd-fmk. thus, compared to mammalian caspase- <dig> and - <dig>  bbtcaspase3-like is a novel caspase with similar apoptotic activity but different protein architecture and cell localization.

bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> interacts with bbtfadd <dig> and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm depending on bbtascs
although phylogenetic analysis clearly showed the evolutionary relationship between bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> and vertebrate caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  the domain architecture of bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> is novel. the n-terminal card of caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> in both invertebrates and vertebrates was replaced with a ded and dd in bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> . thus, to compare its function in amphioxus to that in vertebrates, subcellular localization analysis was conducted. results showed the fusion protein bbtcaspase-1/2-gfp and the truncated mutants containing the dd  located in the nucleus as dot-like or filamentous structures , suggesting that the dd is essential for nuclear localization, as is the card in human caspase- <dig>  <cit> . in spite of the co-localization of bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> and amphioxus casp <dig> and rip <dig> domain containing adaptor with dd  , caspase- <dig> activity and apoptosis were not observed in bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> transfected hela cells  <cit> . however the co-expression of bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> and bbtfadd <dig> leads to dd-dependent co-localization of the two proteins as dot-like subcellular structures in the nucleus . sequence comparison showed a close identity between the dds of bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> and bbtfadd <dig> , indicating that these molecules may be involved in the same signaling pathway. further co-immunoprecipitation tests confirmed their interaction, dependent on dds .

although il- <dig> proteins and ice-like caspases are absent in the amphioxus genome  <cit> , we found two homologs of mammalian asc. both short bbtasc  and long bbtasc  contain an n-terminal ded that is a substitute for a pyd in human asc   <cit> . when bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> was co-transfected in hela cells with bbtascs, the bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> translocated from nucleus to cytoplasm and co-localized with bbtascs   <cit> . the results of co-immunoprecipitation suggested that bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> interacted with bbtascs through the ded . thus, we not only showed the novel domain architecture of bbtcaspase-1/ <dig>  but also demonstrated that it may be involved in apoptosis through bbtfadd <dig>  whose apoptosis function has been characterized previously  <cit> . in addition, we reported the formation of an inflammasome-like complex through the interaction of bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> and bbtasc for the first time in this basal chordate.

the inhibitors of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway-related caspases block amphioxus embryogenesis in early stages
apoptosis is an essential event for development and normal metamorphosis in the metazoan  <cit> . however, most caspases display low levels in the embryo and little is known of their function in embryogenesis  <cit> . immediately following fertilization, we divided embryos into groups treated with four specific caspase inhibitors in dimethyl sulfoxide  and a group treated with dmso alone as a control. the embryos exposed to either dmso or caspase- <dig> inhibitor z-yvad-fmk developed normally. at  <dig> h, the embryos treated with the caspase- <dig> inhibitor z-vdvad-fmk were shorter compared to controls, and showed delayed mouth opening. the other two inhibitors were associated with blocked development at early stages. the effector caspase inhibitor z-devd-fmk stopped embryo development at the blastula and the caspase- <dig> inhibitor z-ietd-fmk blocked embryonic development at the morula .

discussion
the novel domain architecture of the expanded caspase family may have led to the emergence of new apoptotic pathways in amphioxus
genomic annotations of several lower metazoans have revealed an expansion of the caspase family, including  <dig> homologous genes in hydra  <cit> ,  <dig> in the sea urchin  <cit>  and  <dig> in amphioxus  <cit> , compared to only four in the nematode, eight in the fly and twelve in the human. moreover, compared to those in vertebrates, the death-fold domain  -containing caspases in amphioxus are expanded by seven- to ten-fold, and include many with novel domain architectures. for example, the single card in mammalian caspase- <dig> is replaced by a tandem ded and dd in bbtcaspase-1/ <dig>  although the bbtcaspase3-like caspase domain is similar to human caspase-3/ <dig>  it unexpectedly contains an n-terminal ded. since all dfds function as protein-protein interaction facilitators  <cit> , the domain duplication and shuffling by recombination are probably the main force behind increased or diversified protein functions  <cit> . thus, the combining and reshuffling of this domain type in the caspase family provide indications of a greater diversified apoptotic network in amphioxus. this is reflected by the fact that, unlike the reported apoptosis associated with bfcasp-3/ <dig>  which has similar domain architecture to human caspase-3/ <dig>  <cit> , the apoptosis mediated by bbtcaspase3-like is not completely inhibited by the inhibitor z-devd-fmk. in addition, bbtcaspase3-like localized in the nucleus independent of its ded, indicating that a previously unreported nuclear cell death pathway may exist in amphioxus, which is distinct from the known caspase-dependent apoptosis.

the conservation of function of bbtcaspase- <dig> in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
although organisms may have evolved distinct apoptosis networks, some core aspects always remained. the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway is well known, and was thought to be unique to vertebrates before the publication of sea urchin and amphioxus genomes. recently, based on ests and the whole genome assembly of the ancient metazoan phylum cnidaria, a ded-containing caspase, a ded-containing fadd-like adaptor protein and a potential death receptor were identified in hydra  <cit> . in drosophila a death adapter, dfadd, which is homologous to the mammalian fadd, was found to bind death-related ced-3-like protein  through the death inducing domain , a novel dfd involved in caspase adapter interactions and promoting cell death activity  <cit> . our study identified an ortholog of mammalian caspase- <dig> in chinese amphioxus, bbtcaspase- <dig>  this gene contains two tandem deds, as does its mammalian counterpart, and also interacts with bbtfadd <dig> through the deds to induce mammalian cell death. these results suggest that the core molecules participating in the extrinsic pathway arose early, before the vertebrate, and were conserved in eumetazoa. in hela cells, bbtfadd <dig> overexpression alone was not found to induce apoptosis  <cit> , and co-localized with the prodomain of bbtcaspase- <dig> only, indicating that fadd and the initiator caspase evolved dependently. the fadd proteins are likely specific to cognate initiator caspases, but the proteolytic cascade processes of caspases are generally conserved among species.

the association of bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> with bbtascs sets up the foundation for vertebrate pro-inflammatory caspases in regulating inflammation
in vertebrates, nlrs usually recruit the adaptor asc via pyd-pyd interaction. subsequently, the n-terminal card within asc recruits caspase- <dig> to form a complex known as an inflammasome  <cit> . although five ice-like genes have been found in the sea urchin genome, none are linked to the card prodomain, as is the case in vertebrates, and pro-inflammatory functions of caspases have not been identified in sea urchins. here, bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> with the highest similarity to mammalian caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> and two asc molecules with novel domain architectures were identified in amphioxus. in addition, we demonstrated that bbtascs interacted with bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> and led bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. however, no effects on the maturation of il-1Î² and il- <dig> were observed in different mammalian cells transfected with both bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> and bbtascs by elisa testing. one of the possibilities is that the functions of bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> and bbtascs could not be represented in mammalian cell lines, since the pyd in mammalian asc was replaced with a ded both in bbtasc-l and bbtasc-s and a ded and dd tandem prodomain architecture in bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> exists only in amphioxus. to date, there are no homologs of human il- <dig> and il- <dig>  which are important products of mammal inflammasomes, found in the amphioxus genome. moreover, from the analysis of the amphioxus genome, the pyds of amphioxus nlrs were also replaced by deds. thus, although the interacting basic for the inflammasome-like complex has been established, the mechanism and the effectors in amphioxus should be completely different from those in mammals given their different structures. here, we also found that bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> co-localizes with bbtfadd <dig> in the nucleus through the dd, but not with bbtcradd  <cit> . in addition, we previously identified that translocation of bbtfadd <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm induces apoptosis in hela cells  <cit> . although the underlying mechanism of bbtfadd <dig> and bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> in amphioxus apoptosis needs to be tested in future successful cultured amphioxus cells, our results still implied that bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> may be involved in an unidentified apoptotic pathway in the nucleus. thus, bbtcaspase-1/ <dig>  which arose from domain recombination, may have emerged as a molecular switch in controlling the balance between caspase-dependent innate immune response and apoptosis in the basal chordate.

effect of caspase related proteins on amphioxus early embryogenesis
the cell death pathways were originally found in the study of c. elegans and drosophila development and are essential for normal development of body plan and organ structures. some knockout gene mouse studies have been conducted in which caspase- <dig> deficient mice showed no apparent gross abnormalities  <cit> ; caspase- <dig> deficient mice were devoid of severe phenotypic abnormalities, with caspase- <dig> having an impact on neuron apoptosis  <cit> ; caspase- <dig> and - <dig> deficient mice died immediately after birth  <cit> ; and caspase- <dig> deficient mouse fetuses did not survive past mid-gestation  <cit> . as for amphioxus, apoptosis has been examined during amphioxus development and one related protein, bfcasp-3/ <dig> has been proved to be a substrate of caspase inhibitor z-devd-fmk in vitro  <cit> . apart from the bfcasp-3/ <dig> and the three caspase genes we have identified here, there are at least  <dig> other caspase related genes. how such expanded caspase related proteins, including the proteins with caspase-like proteolytic activity, like metacaspases  <cit> , are involved in amphioxus development is not known. to address this question, we used several specific caspase inhibitors to treat amphioxus embryos. the embryos treated with caspase- <dig> inhibitor developed normally. it is possible that no homolog of mammalian caspase- <dig> exists in the amphioxus genome, so its inhibitor has no target in amphioxus. alternatively, this protein may have its expression and function in the adult phase, associated with the immune system, because caspase- <dig> is well-known as an inflammatory caspase in vertebrates. in the sea urchin, ice-like caspase expression has not been detected in either embryo or larva  <cit> , and our rt-pcr results indicate that the expression of bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> is much higher than the other two analyzed in adult tissues. thus, although bbtcaspase-1/ <dig> may interact with bbtfadd <dig>  this potential apoptotic pathway most likely participates in the development of gut openings  and body growth in larvae, but does not influence early embryogenesis, as was seen in the group treated with the caspase- <dig> inhibitor. caspase has been reported to show earliest expression in the mesoderm of the gastrula  <cit> , and bfcasp-3/ <dig> is expressed from gastrula to larva  <cit> . overexpression of bfcasp-3/ <dig> induced mammalian cell apoptosis and the inhibitor z-devd-fmk blocked its activity  <cit> . all of these evidences suggested that bfcasp-3/ <dig> is likely to be one of the effector caspase related proteins inhibited by z-devd-fmk in embryogenesis. moreover, bbtcaspase- <dig> induced hela cell apoptosis and such activity can be inhibited by z-ietd-fmk, indicating that z-ietd-fmk may inhibit the activities of caspase- <dig> related proteins during embryogenesis. in addition, we found that initiator caspases-related proteins may function before effector caspases. thus, these caspases mediate extrinsic apoptosis, which is indispensable in early embryogenesis, probably by inducing cell differentiation and embryonic layer formation.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies not only indicated that the function of dr-mediated extrinsic apoptosis is conserved and completely formed in amphioxus, but also provided the first evidence of the interacting foundation for the inflammasome-like complex in a non-vertebrate. an interesting point is that many amphioxus caspase genes possess novel domain architectures, which provides important insights into understanding how new signaling pathways emerged along with domain recombination and shuffling, especially at the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates.
