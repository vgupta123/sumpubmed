BACKGROUND
pyridine and its derivatives are mainly produced on an industrial scale from coal tar. these compounds are major industrial raw materials and intermediates used for organic solvents and the production of agrichemicals, medicines, and active surfactants  <cit> . pyridines are soluble in polar and nonpolar solvents, and most are toxic  <cit> .

pyridine and its derivatives are also environmental pollutants, and their biodegradation has been studied in detail  <cit> . the biodegradability of pyridine derivatives follows the order pyridinecarboxylic acids > pyridine = monohydroxypyridines > methylpyridines > aminopyridines = chloropyridines  <cit> . generally, pyridines are degraded via pyridine-ring reduction and fission steps  <cit>  or via pyridine-ring hydroxylation and fission steps  <cit> . nocardia sp. strain z <dig> directly cleaves the pyridine ring between n and position c- <dig> and further metabolizes the product via glutaric dialdehyde, and bacillus sp. strain  <dig> cleaves the ring between positions c- <dig> and c- <dig> and the product it further via succinate semialdehyde  <cit> . gordonia nitida strain le <dig> metabolizes 3-methyl- or 3-ethyl-pyridine without a hydroxylation step  <cit> . rhodococcus opacus  and arthrobacter crystallopoietes  hydroxylate the pyridine ring  <cit> . in agrobacterium sp. strain ncib  <dig>  4-hydroxypyridine is metabolized by a hydroxylase and an n-heterocyclic ring-cleavage dioxygenase  <cit> . thus, the biodegradation of pyridines by single bacterial species has been studied, but little is known about the biodegradation of pyridines by microbial communities  <cit> , which could include unculturable bacteria.

aminopyridines are persistent chemical  <cit>  and are a class of potentially genotoxic impurities in pharmaceutical products  <cit> . 4-aminopyridine  has been marketed for agricultural use as avitrol and used for repelling and killing bird pests  <cit> . the compound is a potassium-channel blocker  <cit>  and has epileptogenic action in a variety of animals, including man and mouse  <cit> . however, the metabolic fate of 4-aminopyridine in an ecosystem  <cit>  and its biodegradation by an isolated a bacterium or bacterial community has not been studied in detail. it is broken down slowly by soil microorganisms in  <dig> months  <cit> . here we report the enrichment and adaptation of a 4-aminopyridine-degrading enrichment culture and the characterization of the bacterial populations under different culture conditions.

methods
organisms and growth conditions
enrichments of 4-aminopyridine-degrading bacteria were set up with  <dig>  g normal farm soils such as rice field soil and corn field soils from the hyogo prefecture, japan in  <dig> ml basal medium containing  <dig>  mm  4-aminopyridine as described previously  <cit> . briefly, solutions a , b , and c  were prepared separately. the soil extract used in solution b was prepared by adding  <dig> g of a normal rice field soil to  <dig> ml of deionized water and mixing for  <dig> min, followed by filtration through whatman no.  <dig> filter paper  and autoclaving.

ten 4-aminopyridine-degrading enrichment cultures, km20-14a to km20-14j, were incubated at 30°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm. every  <dig> days,  <dig> μl of the enrichment culture was used to inoculate  <dig> ml fresh medium, to maintain 4-aminopyridine degradation ability. we selected one enrichment culture derived from a normal rice field soil, no. km 20-14e for further study and examined its utilization of the identified metabolites  by the enrichment culture  was examined. the tested substrate was added to the basal medium instead of 4-aminopyridine.

isolation and identification of culturable and unculturable strains from the 4-aminopyridine-degrading enrichment culture
samples taken from the 4-aminopyridine-degrading enrichment culture were serially diluted 106- to 108-fold with  <dig> %  nacl solution and spread onto nutrient agar plates ,  <dig> %  4-aminopyridine agar plates, and  <dig> %   <dig> -dihydroxypyridine agar plates. the plates were incubated at 30°c for  <dig> to  <dig> days, and colonies were picked up for 16s rrna gene analysis. we designated seven dominant bacterial strains isolated from the nutrient agar plate as dominant bacterial strains 4ap-a to 4ap-g. the 16s rrna gene v <dig> regions derived from these strains were used as a pcr-dgge analysis makers as described below.

the isolates were characterized by physiological and biochemical parameters, such as gram reaction, flagella type, catalase activity, oxidase activity, of test, fluorescent pigment production, and hydrolysis of gelatin, starch, and urea, following classical methods and by 16s rrna gene analysis  <cit>  . minor or unculturable strains were classified only by 16s rrna gene analysis. 16s rrna genes were amplified using the universal primers pa and ph’  <cit>  , and their nucleotide sequences  were determined and compared to sequences in the ddbj/embl/genbank database.

isolation, and identification of metabolites from 4-aminopyridine
the enrichment culture was cultivated in basal medium containing  <dig>  mm 4-aminopyridine at 30°c with shaking, and the culture was diluted  <dig> to 108-fold with  <dig> %  nacl solution. the diluted culture  was used to inoculate fresh basal medium containing 4-aminopyridine, and the subculture was incubated at 30°c. the culture was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min, and the supernatant was dried using a rotary evaporator. the dried residues were dissolved in n-butanol and then dried again. the accumulated products in the dried residue were incubated with n,o-bistrifluoroacetamide at 100°c for  <dig>  h. the trimethylsilylated products were analyzed by gc-ms as described below.

measurement and identification of 4-aminopyridine and its metabolites
concentrations of pyridines, including 4-aminopyridine and 4-amino-3-hydroxypyridine , were measured using a hitachi l- <dig> hplc system  equipped with a cosmosil 5c <dig> paq column . the eluent was  <dig> mm potassium phosphate buffer  containing  <dig> mm pentanesulfonate; the flow rate was  <dig>  ml/min. 4-aminopyridine and 4-amino-3-hydroxypyridine were detected at  <dig> nm and had retention times of  <dig>  and  <dig>  min, respectively. the metabolites from 4-aminopyridine  were identified and quantified using a gcms-qp <dig> ultra . a fused silica capillary column  was used. helium gas was the carrier at a linear velocity of  <dig> cm/s. the column temperature was programed from 50°c  to 280°c at a rate of 5°c/min and then held at 280°c for  <dig> min. the peaks derived from the trimethylsilylated derivatives of 4-aminopyridine, 4-amino-3-hydroxypyridine, and  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine appeared at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  min, respectively. the organic acids in the culture supernatant were derivatized by pentafluorobenzyl bromide according to a previously reported method  <cit>  and analyzed by gc-ms as described above. the peaks derived from the pentafluorobenzyl formate appeared at  <dig>  min.

pcr-dgge analysis

 cloning of pcr product and sequencing

prominent dna bands from the dgge gels were extracted and used as pcr templates with the forward primer prba338f without a gc clamp and the reverse primer prun518r. the nucleotide sequences obtained were compared with those of the 16s rrna genes of the strains isolated. to analyze the full-length 16s rrna gene sequences, specific primers were designed based on the partial sequences of the isolate that became more dominant in the culture during continuous growth in basal medium containing 4-aminopyridine .

RESULTS
degradation of 4-aminopyridine by the enrichment culture
we selected one 4-aminopyridine-degrading enrichment culture from the ten enrichment cultures of soil samples incubated continuously with subculturing for  <dig> months. the enrichment culture grew well and could be maintained on basal medium containing 4-aminopyridine in the presence of soil extract. the culture degraded 4-aminopyridine and used it as a carbon and nitrogen source .

identification and degradation of metabolites from 4-aminopyridine
two metabolites in the enrichment culture in medium containing 4-aminopyridine were detected using gc and gc-ms. the trimethylsilylated metabolites, compounds i and ii, had gc retention times of  <dig>  and  <dig>  min, respectively. compound i was detected in the culture on the first day and accumulated during the cultivation. compound ii accumulated temporarily and was gradually degraded during cultivation. the mass spectrum of trimethylsilylated compound i showed a molecular ion at m/z  <dig> . major fragment ions appeared at m/z  <dig>  and  <dig> 3]+, 100%). the mass spectrum of trimethylsilylated compound ii showed a molecular ion at m/z  <dig> . major fragment ions appeared at m/z  <dig> ,  <dig>  <dig>   <dig> %),  <dig> 2si = o–si3]+,  <dig> %), and  <dig> 3]+, 100%). the gc retention times and ms spectra of trimethylsilylated compounds i and ii agreed with those of trimethylsilylated authentic 4-amino-3-hydroxypyridine and  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine, respectively.

pyridines are metabolized into an organic acid, such as acetate, formate, or dicarboxylic acids  <cit> . the culture supernatant of the enrichment culture was mixed with pentafluorobenzyl bromide and then analyzed. the mass spectrum of the pentafluorobenzyl derivative showed a molecular ion at m/z  <dig> . the gc retention time and ms spectrum of the derivatized compound agreed with those of formate derivatized by pentafluorobenzyl bromide. in the enrichment cultures grown on  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mm 4-aminopyridine for  <dig> days,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm formate accumulated in  <dig>  mm 4-aminopyridine medium.

although the enrichment culture gradually degraded 4-aminopyridine with growth, 4-amino-3-hydroxypyridine accumulated in the culture to a final concentration of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> mm after  <dig> days of cultivation. when we cultivated the enrichment culture in basal medium containing 4-amino-3-hydroxypyridine or  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine  with and without 4-aminopyridine, the culture completely degraded  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine in both media in  <dig> days but did not degrade 4-amino-3-hydroxypyridine in either medium.

identification of the gene encoding 3-hydroxy-4-pyridine dioxygenase in the isolated strains
we hypothesized that 4-aminopyridine is metabolized to  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine, and that the pyridine ring is then cleaved by 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone dioxygenase, as described below. the fragment amplified by pyda-specific primers was isolated and analyzed to determine whether some predominant strain in the enrichment culture carries the dioxygenase gene. the same sequence fragment was amplified from three different samples. the amino acid sequence deduced from the determined 801-bp sequence showed a high level of identity with sequences of the extradiol-dioxygenase-3b-like superfamily of proteins, especially with that of the putative pyda from hyphomicrobium sp. mc <dig>  .

isolation of culturable bacterial strains from the enrichment culture
the enrichment culture contained at least seven strains of dominant bacteria  that could grow on nutrient agar. the physiological and biochemical parameters of strains 4ap-a and 4ap-g were characterized, and their 16s rrna genes were analyzed by sequencing. strains 4ap-b, 4ap-c, 4ap-d, 4ap-e, and 4ap-f were classified by 16s rrna gene analysis . none of these strains could degrade 4-aminopyridine by itself or when combined with other strains, including all six of the other culturable dominant strains.

when ten-fold-diluted enrichment culture was spread on agar plates containing 4-aminopyridine, several small colonies appeared. colony pcr analysis of the 16s rrna gene indicated that these were colonies of strains 4ap-a, identified as a species of pseudomonas and 4ap-g, identified as a species of enterobacter. attempts to isolate 4-aminopyridine-degrading bacteria by changing the concentration of 4-aminopyridine and the incubation period at 30°c were unsuccessful. we could, however, isolate large colonies of strain 4ap-a on an agar plate containing  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine.

dgge analysis of the enrichment culture
the enrichment culture grown in  <dig>  mm 4-aminopyridine medium was used to inoculate fresh medium containing 4-aminopyridine, and aliquots of the new, growing culture were collected in the early-, mid-, and late-exponential growth phases as described in the materials and methods section. in dgge gels, the intensity of the bands of some samples increased with the degradation of 4-aminopyridine, and two main bands were present at the same intensity in all samples throughout growth . these two main bands were assigned to strains 4ap-a and 4ap-g based on sequence analysis of the v <dig> regions of the 16s rrna gene from those two main bands and of the complete 16s rrna gene from culturable strains 4ap-a to 4ap-g.

we then cultivated the enrichment culture in medium containing various concentrations of 4-aminopyridine to reveal the effect of the compound on the abundance of the dominant bacteria. the intensity of a new band  increased with the 4-aminopyridine concentration , whereas the intensity of the bands assigned to strains 4ap-a and 4ap-g decreased.

to clarify the role of strain 4ap-y in the biodegradation of 4-aminopyridine, we diluted the enrichment culture 108-fold in  <dig> %  nacl solution and used it to inoculate  <dig> tubes of medium containing  <dig>  mm 4-aminopyridine, yeast extract, and soil extract. the optical density at  <dig> nm gradually and similarly increased in all subcultures. however, the rates of 4-aminopyridine degradation in the  <dig> subcultures differed. we compared the bacteria in the three subcultures that completely degraded 4-aminopyridine in  <dig> days  with the subculture that did not degrade the substrate . dgge analysis showed that those subcultures that degraded 4-aminopyridine contained strain 4ap-y as a predominant strain , whereas the subculture that did not degrade 4-aminopyridine did not contain strain 4ap-y .

the full-length sequence of the 16s rrna gene of strain 4ap-y showed a high level of identity with that of a hyphomicrobium species detected in a waste-treatment plant  and of unculturable hyphomicrobium species detected by pcr-dgge  . species of the genus hyphomicrobium form characteristic mother cells with hyphae and can utilize c <dig> compounds, e.g., methanol, formate, or methylamine  <cit> . we observed bi-polar filamentous cells with this shape in the culture grown with 4-aminopyridine . our attempts to isolate hyphomicrobium sp. strain 4ap-y using medium containing methanol, formate, or formamide according to previously reported methods  <cit>  failed.

we analyzed the bacteria in a culture grown with  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine by pcr-dgge . the culture completely degraded  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine during  <dig> days of cultivation. among the dominant bacteria, strain 4ap-a grew well in the  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine medium and completely degraded  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine during  <dig> days of cultivation. strain 4ap-g grew slowly and degraded the substrate in  <dig> days. in the dgge gels, several bands, including that of strain 4ap-a, were present; the band corresponding to strain 4ap-y was absent; and a new band appeared. the sequence of the 16s rrna gene of the bacterium corresponding to the new band, strain 4ap-z, showed a high level of identity with those of elizabethkingia spp. . we also analyzed the bacteria in a culture grown with formate by pcr-dgge . in the dgge gels, several bands, including that of strain y, were present.

discussion
the pyridine-ring hydroxylation step is one of main initial steps in the degradation of pyridines  <cit> . our analyses of the accumulated metabolites from 4-aminopyridine and the growth substrate specificity suggested that 4-aminopyridine was converted to 4-amino-3-hydroxypyridine and  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine . we hypothesized that 4-hydroxypyridine is another possible metabolite based on the previously reported metabolic pathways of pyridines  <cit> . the enrichment culture could not degrade 4-amino-3-hydroxypyridine and 4-hydroxypyridine, even when 4-aminopyridine was added to the medium. therefore, 4-amino-3-hydroxypyridine must be a dead-end product. in the enrichment culture, 4-aminopyridine probably would be directly converted to  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine mainly by dehydroxylation and the release of ammonia , similar to the conversion of aniline to benzenediol  by a dioxygenase  <cit> .

how  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine is further metabolized in the enrichment culture is not known, but in agrobacterium sp. ncib  <dig>   <dig> -dihydroxypyridine is converted to 3-formiminopyruvate via the putative intermediate 3--formiminopyruvate by the n-heterocyclic ring-cleavage dioxygenase, 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone dioxygenase   <cit> . the gene encoding 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone dioxygenase, pyda, from rhizobium sp. tal <dig> has been cloned, and the pyd gene cluster  involved in the degradation and transport of 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone has been functionally analyzed  <cit> . however, the dioxygenases from strains ncib  <dig> and tal <dig> have not yet been purified and characterized. this enzyme is unstable and easily loses activity during cell extract preparation  <cit> . pyda from strain tal <dig> shows a high level of sequence identity with previously reported class iii type meta-cleavage dioxygenases including putative 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone dioxygenase  from hyphomicrobium sp. mc <dig>  here, we did not detect dioxygenase activity in the mixed cells harvested from the enrichment culture. in a preliminary study, the partial pyda gene fragment could be amplified from the cells by using pyda-specific primers. in future studies, we plan on sequencing the entire gene and analyzing its expression with northern blots instead of detecting dioxygenase activity, to obtain support for our proposed metabolic pathway for 4-aminopyridine.

dgge analyses indicated that hyphomicrobium sp. strain 4ap-y is a prominent degrader of 4-aminopyridine in the enrichment culture  and that strain 4ap-y is outnumbered in  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine medium . therefore, strain 4ap-y probably converts 4-aminopyridine to  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine .  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine, which is also formed from l-mimosine by intestinal bacteria, can be degraded by a much wider range of soil bacteria and ruminal bacteria than has been recognized previously  <cit> .  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine might be more easily degraded than 4-aminopyridine by the other strains in our enrichment culture, including strains 4ap-a and 4ap-z .

hyphomicrobium spp. closely related to strain 4ap-y have been isolated from waste-water plants  <cit>  or detected as unculturable bacteria by pcr-dgge  <cit> . species of the genus hyphomicrobium are oligocarbophilic and can grow on mineral salt medium, and the growth can be stimulated by soil extract  <cit> . in addition, they grow well on c <dig> compounds, such as methanol, methylated amines or formate  <cit> . however, little is known about the assimilation of aromatic compounds by hyphomicrobium spp.  <cit> . the unculturable hyphomicrobium sp. y17- <dig> becomes numerically dominant in enrichment cultures containing toluene and o-xylene  <cit> . in our enrichment culture, hyphomicrobium sp. 4ap-y probably plays an important role in the initial step of 4-aminopyridine degradation. other dominant strains, such as strains 4ap-a and 4ap-z probably share  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine and its metabolites as growth substrates. strain 4ap-y probably utilizes one of final metabolites from  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine, i.e., formate, via the further degradation of this intermediate by other dominant strains.

the phytotoxicity, absorption, and translocation of 4-aminopyridine in corn and sorghum growing in treated nutrient cultures and soils have been examined by starr and cunningham  <cit> . although aerobic and anaerobic degradation of 4-aminopyridine in soil had been expected, the authors found little evidence to support biodegradation. our data reported here indicated that 4-aminopyridine can be mineralized by soil microbiota, and we identified bacteria possibly involved in the degradation. to further elucidate the degradation, we will need to establish culture conditions for the isolation of strain 4ap-y to be able to study the enzymes involved in the degradation of 4-aminopyridine.

CONCLUSIONS
we isolated a 4-aminopyridine-degrading enrichment culture from a normal soil sample, revealed the metabolic fate of 4-aminopyridine, and characterized the bacterial population in the culture. gc-ms analysis and growth substrate specificity indicated that 4-aminopyridine was probably metabolized to  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine and that formate probably is one of metabolites. dgge analysis revealed that the unculturable strain, hyphomicrobium sp. strain 4ap-y became more dominant with increasing 4-aminopyridine concentration in the culture and in the presence of formate and elizabethkingia sp. 4ap-z was dominant in the presence of  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine. hyphomicrobium sp. strain 4ap-y, elizabethkingia sp. 4ap-z, and the culturable  <dig> -dihydroxypyridine-degrading bacterium, pseudomonas nitroreducens 4ap-a and enterobacter sp. 4ap-g probably play important roles in 4-aminopyridine degradation.
