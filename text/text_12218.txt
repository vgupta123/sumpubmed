BACKGROUND
microarray expression profiling has been widely applied to biological studies because of its ability to simultaneously examine tens of thousands of gene expression patterns. microarray experiments have also proven to be quite useful for investigating associations between genes and physiological and clinical response measurements of many human diseases  <cit> . in particular, unsupervised learning techniques such as hierarchical clustering analysis have become one of the most commonly-used techniques for analyzing microarray data since these techniques can effectively summarize high-dimensional gene expression data in a two-dimensional color-coded cluster heatmap based on many genes' expression associations  <cit> . several other clustering techniques such as k-means clustering, self-organization maps, and gene shaving have been used for microarray data analysis  <cit> . the main objective of these clustering analyses, however, has been to summarize the expression pattern associations among genes, but not the direct association with interesting physiological response data on study subjects.

several supervised learning and statistical modeling approaches have also been used to analyze the gene expression data along with other response variables such as treatment group variables  <cit> , clinical response data such as survival times  <cit> , and bayesian regression modeling  <cit> . however, these approaches are often based on the dichotomization of quantitative response data, resulting in significant loss of information. furthermore, these methods are mainly used for the discovery of gene factors and prediction models between different response groups and cannot provide high-dimensional association information between genes and response variables.

in this study, we propose a novel clustering analysis approach, the so-called response projected clustering , which accounts for both the relationships among gene expression patterns themselves and their association with response data. this rpc approach is motivated by a relatively simple geometrical observation that a relevant response vector can be projected to each gene vector in their high-dimensional space to reflect each gene's association with the response data prior to the clustering analysis. for rpc analysis, all gene or response vectors are first standardized . the response vector is then projected into each gene so that its resulting projection resides in each gene's subspace proportional to the association strength with the response variable, not changing each gene vector's direction  in the high-dimensional gene expression space . clustering analysis on the remaining fractions of the genes  is then performed in the projected gene space based on their pairwise euclidean distances. rpc thus transforms each gene expression vector into the new variable that reflects its degree of association with the response data. in this transformation, more highly-correlated genes with the response variable will have closer distances from the origin  and each other  since they are shrunk toward the origin . note that the response vector itself becomes the origin in this projection and that it is clustered together with other gene vectors which directly shows which groups of genes are highly associated with the response metadata. note also that the genes initially highly correlated with each other and associated with the response variable in a similar degree will maintain their close distance and association even after this projection.

avoiding unstable clustering patterns due to small changes of input data orders and heuristic clustering algorithms, we further refined rpc by using bootstrap-based counting measures in order to obtain robust clustering patterns with statistical significance. our rpc method is applied to the drug activity data of in vitro growth inhibition by docetaxel and microarray data on the nci- <dig> cancer cell lines  <cit>  and the microarray study for atherogenic macrophage differentiation to foam cells  <cit> .

RESULTS
docetaxel chemosensitivity and microarray gene expression data on the nci- <dig> cancer cell lines
docetaxel is one of the most widely-used anti-neoplastic chemotherapeutic compounds to treat various tumors such as breast, non-small cell lung, gastrointestinal , and prostate cancers  <cit> . major target genes of docetaxel are known to be bcl <dig> and tubb <dig>  however, because this compound was originally derived from a natural extract , its complete molecular chemosensitivity mechanisms and pathways are not completely understood  <cit> .

in our current application, we use in vitro drug activity data of docetaxel on the nci- <dig> cancer cell line panel, so-called gi <dig>   <cit> , together with publicly-available nci- <dig> genome-wide expression profiling data of affymetrix hg-u133a  <cit> . the nci- <dig> cell line panel consists of nine cancer subtypes: lung, colon, breast, ovarian, leukemia, renal, melanoma, prostate, and central nervous system cancers. all microarrays are normalized by iqr-normalization which is a method that q <dig> and q <dig> of all microarrays have the same value  <cit> .

fig.  <dig> shows the box-plots of -log values for the nine cancer subtypes of nci- <dig>  as shown, breast, non-small lung, colon, and prostate cancer cells were generally sensitive to this compound whereas melanoma and renal cancer cell lines were less sensitive. note that the nci- <dig> gene expression profiling data were obtained prior to the docetaxel treatment but we assumed that there were innate molecular expression signatures that were highly correlated with the docetaxel chemosensitivity as often found in other studies  <cit> .

we first identified genes that were strongly correlated with the gi <dig> values of docetaxel on nci- <dig>  fig.  <dig> shows the top six genes' expression patterns which were either positively  or negatively  highly-correlated with the gi <dig> values. as shown in this figure, these genes' expression patterns are somewhat different – some were lowly correlated to each other, potentially implying different molecular mechanisms of the drug mechanisms of action. thus, this simple correlation-based discovery could provide highly-correlated genes with drug response data but it was not possible to directly understand and explore these genes' interactive functional relationships with the drug's chemosensitivity. we thus applied rpc to project the nci- <dig> drug activity data into its expression profiling data.

rpc analysis on nci- <dig> data
after we standardized gene expressions and gi <dig> as described in the methods section, we derived the response projected shrinkage factors between gi <dig> and gene expression data with  <dig> - |r| for all the genes  and the null distribution obtained by  <dig> permutations of labels in the drug sensitivity data . r is the correlation between response gi <dig> and each gene expression. as shown, the observed distribution of the rpc projection distances is skewed toward  <dig> and a relatively small number of genes were identified with statistically short distances. for example,  <dig> genes were selected with a false discovery rate   <dig>  or less . this fdr threshold is somewhat large, but 80% of the identified genes would still be biologically relevant to the drug activity ; no gene was found with fdr <  <dig> . table  <dig> shows the list of these  <dig> selected genes, their rpc distances, and functional information.

to examine the relationships among these selected genes themselves and with the drug sensitivity gi <dig> values, we performed the standard hierarchical clustering analysis with correlation distance , the standard hierarchical clustering with absolute value of correlation , and the rpc analysis . note that the clustering analysis was performed among genes but not among arrays since the clustering order among the conditions was not very informative in this analysis. fig. 5a, 5b and 5c were the heatmaps using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage. in fig. 5a, other than a few genes  that were highly correlated with the drug activity data, most other genes were clustered based on their own gene expression associations, especially negatively and positively correlated genes separately. in fig. 5b, fen <dig> were clustered with gi50; however, dgkz and nup <dig> were clustered with other genes similar to the results of fig. 5a. on the contrary, the rpc heatmap  shows that gene subclusters have gradually weaker associations with drug activity as they are away from the drug  vector. furthermore, l1cam, cdkn1c, and fen <dig>  which have been reported to be relevant to breast cancer – the most sensitive subtype to docetaxel among the nine nci- <dig> cancer subtypes – were clustered just next to the drug vector. also, capg and fen <dig>  which showed the highest correlation with gi <dig>  were clustered together with this drug in this rpc analysis whereas capg was clustered in a completely different branch from the drug in the standard clustering analysis. also note that both positively and negatively-correlated genes were well clustered together in this rpc analysis if they were highly associated to each other.

for the above selected genes, we also obtained their gene ontology  information and further analyzed them using gostat for evaluating statistical significance of overrepresented functional and molecular mechanisms  <cit> . the majority were found to belong to the molecular component of intracellular membrane-bound organelle : capg, ccnb <dig>  cdkn1c, fen <dig>  gata <dig>  snrpn, dgkz, smc2l <dig>  nup <dig>  pole <dig>  rab5b, ptpn <dig>  and prpf <dig>  we found that one of the known target genes of docetaxel, tubb <dig>  belongs to the same intracellular organelle category even though this target itself was not significant on the nci- <dig> data. many of these genes have also been found to be quite relevant to carcinogenic mechanisms. for example, l1cam, gata <dig>  ccnb <dig>  cdkn1c, and fen <dig> have been reported for their association with breast cancer: l1cam was shown to inhibit the growth of breast carcinoma cells  <cit> . gata <dig> was reported to regulate aromatase pii promoter activity in breast cancer cells  <cit> . camp-responsive gonad-type pii promoter ultimately leads to increased intratumoral estrogen production and tumor growth. ccnb <dig> was reported to be upregulated in mcf-ir <dig> breast cancer cells by microarray experiment and to significantly reduce the clonogenic survival of mcf-ir <dig> cells  <cit> . cdkn1c showed a loss of heterozygosity for 11p <dig> . 11p <dig>  is an important tumor-suppressor gene region showing loss of heterozygosity in wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer  <cit> . fen <dig> was shown to be repressed in e <dig> in er-positive breast cancer cells  <cit> . abcb <dig> is especially found to be highly relevant to the docetaxel response. it was reported that resistance arose by the overexpression of drug efflux pumps including mdr <dig>  when docetaxel is medicated  <cit> . ppm1a, snrpn, rab5b, and capg were also reported to be related to cancer  <cit> .

we performed the bootstrapping-based rpc analysis as described in the methods section in order to obtain more statistically consistent subclusters in fig. 5d. for the identified gene subclusters in this figure, we investigated several pathway databases to understand whether some of these subclusters of genes were relevant to certain carcinogenic pathway mechanisms. interestingly, a subcluster of four genes – cdkn1c, fen <dig>  ccnb <dig>  and pole <dig> – were found to be directly associated with the pcna pathway  which is relevant to dna replication and cell cycle control/check point . the other subcluster of ppm1a, cdkn1c, and ccnb <dig> was also found to belong to the pathway of cell cycle growth factor and damage check points . thus, it will be quite interesting to further investigate functional and pathway mechanisms of some of these tightly-clustered genes.

rpc analysis for pparγ during macrophage differentiation in atherogenesis
a microarray gene expression study was performed to identify novel atherogenic mechanisms involved in macrophage  differentiation to foam cells at the university of virginia  <cit> . in this experiment, human monocyte-derived macrophages  were incubated with different types of low density lipoproteins  conditions such as naïve ldl, oxidized ldl , and minimally modified ldl , which provide quite different microenvironments in atherogenesis. in this microarray experiment, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type γ , which plays important roles in atherogenesis and is a molecular target for pharmaceutical products such as avandia® for treating cardiovascular complication among type  <dig> diabetic patients , was found to be highly upregulated by oxldl and naïve ldl during the macrophage differentiation to foam cells. this selective regulation again demonstrates that pparγ is highly relevant to atherogenesis, necessitating more targeted investigation on this gene under its respective cellular environments. however, pparγ, as a transcription factor has been found to interact with many different genes, and its complete pathway mechanisms in atherogenesis still need to be carefully investigated associated with this gene's expression patterns on different microenvironments.

thus, we applied our rpc approach to the macrophage differentiation microarray data as if the gene expression values of pparγ were response data in order to find the gene networks closely associated with this gene factor . in order to remove random genes clustered with other biologically relevant genes, we preselected genes based on the significance of their differential expression among different ldl conditions with fdr <  <dig>   <cit> . the standard clustering analysis led to gene clusters with pparγ based simply on each gene's correlation with other genes or pparγ's correlation with genes . many lowly-correlated genes with pparγ, e.g., fez <dig> , tpt <dig>  are closely clustered with it whereas highly negatively-correlated genes, e.g. insig <dig>  and ccl <dig>  are found further away from it. on the contrary, in the rpc analysis, many genes highly correlated with pparγ such as apoe, lpl, cd <dig>  mt <dig>  and il1b are tightly clustered by themselves and closely clustered with it . pparγ is also closely clustered with p <dig>  pparβ, and abcg <dig> which are well-known for their roles in atherosclerosis. lowly-correlated genes are assigned away from pparγ gradually in this rpc analysis, and both positively and negatively highly-correlated genes are closely clustered with this gene despite their opposite expression directions.

pparγ has also been reported to regulate many fatty acid factors during the form-cell formation including a group of fatty acid regulation genes such as cd <dig>  abca <dig>  apoe, and lpl  <cit> . in our rpc analysis, we could effectively identify their tight associations with pparγ and discover novel gene factors such as ccl <dig> and il1b which are also known to play a role in atherogenesis but have not been reported for any direct association with pparγ. for example, the two transcripts of cd <dig>  are tightly clustered with ccl <dig>  which implies their close functional association in the opposite direction, or potentially inhibition. note that these clustering results could not be observed by a standard clustering analysis. overall, applying rpc to pparγ expression patterns on the mΦ-differentiation microarray data, genes relevant to atherogenic pparγ functions, e.g., ldl  and oxldl  groups move closer to the pparγ gene whereas the groups of genes less relevant to pparγ, e.g., mmldl  groups move away from it.

discussion
we introduced a novel clustering analysis approach here – response projected clustering  that can simultaneously summarize associations both with important physiological response data and with gene expression patterns themselves. the rpc method effectively performs such an integrated analysis by directly projecting response data into the high-dimensional gene expression vectors. we believe that since clustering analysis plays a significant role in exploring coexpression patterns of a large number of genes in microarray profiling data, the rpc approach will be quite useful by examining such high-dimensional data simultaneously with those genes' association with the response data. using a bootstrapping-based clustering measure, we also performed rpc analysis based on statistical significance of tightness of subclusters.

rpc can be utilized in many different clustering analyses to investigate high-throughput biological profiling data together with relevant physiological response data if molecular signatures exist in the profiling data highly associated with the physiological response. it can also be used for a particular gene in microarray data to investigate the gene's associated groups of other genes. we, however, suspect that the degrees of molecular association with some response data such as patient long-term survival and outcome data may be weak and noisy, and careful understanding on such an association may improve the utility of the rpc technique.

in our current study, we first applied rpc to the docetaxel drug activity and the microarray expression profiling data on the nci- <dig> cancer cell lines. in this application, the selected genes  were found to be quite tightly associated with dna replication and cell cycle pathways. the above findings may suggest that this compound interferes with the dna replication process in order to inhibit tumor cell growth; it will be interesting if the roles and functions of these genes are further investigated for their involvement in this drug activity to administer this chemotherapeutic compound more effectively in treating patients.

we showed a different utilization of the rpc approach in our second application by using the expression values of a targeted gene factor, pparγ, as response data in order to find other genes' expression patterns and networks closely associated with this gene. in this analysis, we were able to confirm many known genes as well as novel gene factors relevant to this target gene's functions and pathways in atherogenesis. in order to apply rpc to a subset of biologically relevant genes, we preselected genes that were differentially regulated between the experimental conditions of atherogenesis with fdr <  <dig> ; bigger fdr cutoff values resulted in much larger numbers of genes of which clustering results were less clear and difficult to interpret. this application demonstrates well that one can utilize rpc analysis in searching gene association networks on various contexts of genome-wide expression studies associated with a particular gene factor.

in this study, we used  <dig> - |r| as an rpc  distance based on correlation  between the gene expression and drug activity data . of course, any projection distance of c-f formed with a monotone function f can be used as such a distance if such a projection transformation can effectively discriminate different degrees of association with response data among candidate molecular signatures. also note that the rpc transformed distance, directly derived from the rpc geometrical projection, can be modified into an even simpler form such as:

 drpc =  || xg <dig> - xg2||, 

when xg <dig> = {xg <dig> ...,xg1n} and xg <dig> = {xg <dig> ...,xg2n} are the g <dig> and g <dig> gene vectors, respectively. the r <dig> is the correlation between the g <dig> gene vector and response vector and the r <dig> is between the g <dig> gene vector and response vector. we also note that several different clustering algorithms have been explored in our preliminary studies such as single, complete, average linkages . while they show slightly different tree structures, the tightly clustered genes were found to be consistent. thus, the clustering results presented here use the average linkage algorithm.

other forms of modification are certainly possible which may deserve a full comparison study both by simulation and practical application in a future study. more generally, rpc can be applied with different measures of association beyond correlation evaluation if the association between the biological profiling data and response data can be identified with a different measure, e.g. snp data with linkage association scores. these different functions and algorithms need to be further investigated in the future. also note that we introduced our rpc algorithm using hierarchical clustering but our rpc projection can be applied to other clustering algorithms such as k-means, som, and others. finally, we note that rpc application will be more difficult if the degrees of molecular association are weak and noisy with some response data such as patient long-term survival and outcome data. in these cases, careful understanding on such association may improve the utility of the rpc technique.

CONCLUSIONS
we introduced a novel clustering analysis approach here – response projected clustering  – that can simultaneously summarize associations both with important physiological and clinical response data and with gene expression patterns themselves. rpc can be considered as an enhanced integration of the unsupervised learning with supervised learning techniques, effectively performing such an integrated analysis by directly projecting response data into the high-dimensional gene expression vectors. using its simple projection transformation, the rpc approach allows one to effectively examine high-dimensional gene expression data simultaneously with relevant response data or with a specific gene target which would be extremely useful in many biomedical gene expression studies.
