BACKGROUND
betulinic acid  belongs to lupane-type triterpenes and its derivatives show a wide range of health benefits, such as anti-cancer  <cit> , anti-hiv  <cit> , anti-virus  <cit> , and anti-malarial activities  <cit> . in particular, ba shows a selectively inhibitory activity against melanoma cells with no side effects on regular ones  <cit> . despite these promising activities, commercial application of this compound is limited largely due to its short supply from nature. ba accumulates at low quantities in many plants including syzygium jambos  <cit> , ziziphus jujube  <cit> , diospyros kaki thunb  <cit> , and betula platyphylla  <cit> . of these ba-producing plant species, betula platyphylla is the major source of ba for the drug market. the production of ba has heavily relied on the phytochemical extraction from the betula platyphylla barks. in china, around  <dig>  t of the betula platyphylla barks per year are consumed for the extraction of ba . apparently, the overexploitation on the betula platyphylla barks would be problematic for continually supplying ba in a long term aspect.

the biosynthetic pathway of ba has been elucidated before  <cit> . cyclization of  <dig> -oxidosqualene by lupeol synthase to produce lupeol is the initial committed step toward ba biosynthesis, and the lupeol synthase gene from arabidopsis thaliana  has been isolated  <cit> . lupeol is then successively oxidized at its c <dig> position to yield ba by a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme, lupeol c- <dig> oxidase . we previously reported that an amyrin oxidase from catharanthus roseus  showed the lo activity  <cit> . by the combinatory expression of crao and atlup <dig>  we succeeded in engineering the ba production in s. cerevisiae via the yeast endogenous  <dig> -oxidosqualene  <cit> . in addition to crao from catharanthus roseus, the genes encoding other lo enzymes had been isolated from several plant species, including cyp716a <dig> from medicago truncatula and cyp716a <dig> from vitis vinifera  <cit> . despite that betula platyphylla bark is the major source for the production of ba, the lo gene of this plant remains not isolated. therefore, here we reported on the isolation and characterization of the lo gene from betula platyphylla bark . relative to the previously identified los described above, bplo showed a higher ba-producing activity in yeast.

after the success of engineering ba biosynthesis in yeast, the next challenge is to boost its production. when foreign pathways are introduced into a microbial host, its existing metabolic network would tightly control carbon fluxes to foreign compounds. the yeast strain that we previously used for engineering the ba production is a laboratory s. cerevisiae strain wat <dig>  <cit> . the yeast wat <dig> strain has a genomically integrated arabidopsis thaliana nadph-cyp reductase as a redox partner for the cyps  <cit> , and is usually used to characterize plant cytochrome p <dig> enzymes  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae cen.pk is another yeast strain which has often been employed for synthesizing a wide range of products in industry  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae cen.pk strain contains a significantly higher content of ergosterol than other s. cerevisiae strains  <cit> . genomic sequencing revealed that the cen.pk strain contains a number of snps in the coding regions of ergosterol and fatty acid pathway enzymes  <cit> . the authors suggested that those snps might be responsible for the high-level ergosterol accumulation of this strain. both ergosterol and ba are cyclized from  <dig> -oxidosqualene, a common precursor for the biosynthesis of sterols and triterpenes. a higher accumulation of ergosterol in the cen.pk strain prompted us to test whether it is better than other yeast strains to engineer the ba production. therefore, in this study, the ba pathway was integrated into the genomes of both the wat <dig> and cen.pk strains and their ba-producing abilities were compared.

in our previous attempts to engineer the ba production in yeast, the ba pathway was expressed in either a constitutive or a galactose-inducible manner, and galactose-inducible promoters  appeared to be stronger to direct the expression of the ba pathway genes  <cit> . therefore, in this study, all the ba pathway genes were cloned under galactose-inducible promoters. the induction of gal genes is controlled by a protein complex of gal3p, gal4p and gal80p  <cit> . gal4p is a transcriptional activator that binds to the upstream activation sequences of gal genes to activate the transcriptions of the genes. when glucose is used as the sole carbon source, the activation domain of gal4p is masked by the repressor gal80p, thereby preventing the transcriptions of gal genes. in the presence of galactose, the signal transducer gal3p binds to gal80p to expose the activating domain of gal4p, leading to the activation of gal genes. it has been reported that a yeast mutant lacking gal80p produced higher levels of carotenoids when the carotenoid pathway genes were controlled by galactose-inducible promoters  <cit> . here, we also reported that the gal80p mutant increased the ba production, which was up to  <dig> -folds of that produced by the wild yeast strain.

RESULTS
isolation and functional analysis of bplo
a 1082 bp-cdna fragment was amplified using the degenerate primers 1/ <dig> from the bark of b. platyphylla where ba primarily accumulates  <cit> . the resulting cdna fragment showed sequence identities to the genes coding for the previously reported lo enzymes, and therefore its full-length cdna  was further cloned by race-pcr technique using primers 3– <dig>  bplo was also officially named as cyp716a <dig> by the standard p <dig> nomenclature committee  <cit> . during our biochemical characterization of bplo, the bplo gene was also isolated by another group from the northeast forestry university of china, and was named as ath <dig> . the predicted protein sequence of bplo showed 79–81 % identity at the amino acid level with the previously published los, including crao from c. roseus, cyp716a <dig> from m. truncatula and cyp716a <dig> from v. vinifera.

to examine the activity of bplo, the bplo gene was co-expressed in the wat <dig> yeast strain with atlup <dig>  the yeast cells transformed with the empty vector or expressing atlup <dig> alone served as the control. the wat <dig> strain contains an arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome p450: nadph reductase atr <dig>  <cit>  that is required for the activity of plant p <dig> enzymes. compared to the empty vector control, the expression of atlup <dig> alone led to the production of lupeol and an unknown peak  <dig>  due to the absence of the authentic standard, we were not able to determine the identity of the peak <dig>  but it was assumed to be 3α,20-dihydroxylupane , as it was previously found as the second major product of the atlup <dig>  in addition to lupeol  <cit> . when atlup <dig> and bplo were co-expressed, lupeol was successively oxidized at its c- <dig> position by bplo to yield betulin  and betulinic acid  which were not produced by the control yeast cells . the identities of bn and ba products were confirmed by comparisons with their authentic standards . these data clearly suggested that bplo functions as a lo enzyme. interestingly, bplo also seemed to be able to convert the peak  <dig> to the products of peaks  <dig> and  <dig> with the peak  <dig> being negligible . the peak  <dig> and peak  <dig> could be the oxidized alcohol and acid products of lupanediol, respectively, which was presumably catalyzed by bplo at the c- <dig> position of lupanediol. the mass spectrums of the trimethylsilyl-derivatives of the peaks 1– <dig> were shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> functional analysis of bplo by its co-expression with atlup <dig> in yeast cells. gc–ms analysis was shown for the products from the yeast cells expressing atlup1/bplo yielding lupeol , betulin , betulinic acid , and the unknown products , and the cells expressing atlup <dig> alone yielding lupeol and the unknown peak  <dig>  the identities of lup, bn and ba were confirmed with their corresponding chemical standards by comparing their mass fragmented products . the identities of the peaks 1– <dig> were not determined due to the absence of their chemical standards, and their ms spectrums were shown in additional file 1: figure s2



to examine the relevance of the bplo transcript to ba biosynthesis in betula platyphylla, we have investigated the accumulation pattern of the bplo transcripts and its enzymatic products  across different tissues of betula platyphylla. the bplo transcript was mostly observed in the roots and barks while absent in the leaves . on the other hand, gc-ms analysis showed the accumulation of the bplo products  in the roots and barks, whereas none of them was detected in the leaves . therefore, the bplo gene expression pattern is overall consistent with the ba accumulation in vivo. however, a higher level of the bplo transcript was detected in the roots relative to the barks whereas the barks contain higher levels of the bplo products than the roots. this inconsistence may be caused by the transport of bplo products from the roots to the barks or less precursor lupeol in the roots supplied for bplo. we also examined the level of lupeol in these tissues, but it was not detectable probably due to its complete conversion to bn and ba.fig.  <dig> the accumulation pattern of the bplo transcripts and its enzymatic products in b. platyphylla tissues. a the bplo transcripts measured by qrt-pcrs; b the bplo enzymatic products  measured by gc-ms analysis. bn, betulin; ba, betulinic acid. error bars represent the standard errors  of the means calculated from three biological replicates



bplo showed a higher ba-producing activity than the previously reported los
to evaluate the ba-producing activity between bplo, crao and cyp716a <dig>  these los were initially expressed in the wat <dig> strain alone, and each resultant yeast culture was then fed with 50 μm lupeol as the lo substrate. after galactose induction, very low levels of ba were produced in all the three yeast cultures , indicating that the substrate lupeol was indeed taken up by the yeast strain but at a very low efficiency. interestingly, even under this condition, bplo seemed to produce higher levels of ba than crao and cyp716a <dig> . to further compare their activities, the three lo genes were then co-expressed with the lupeol synthesizing gene atlup <dig> in the wat <dig> strain. after induction with 2 % galactose for 60 h, the yeast cultures were all acidified to ph  <dig>  and extracted with ethyl acetate for gc-ms analysis. once again, bplo produced the most ba while the lowest amount of bn in comparisons with the crao and cyp716a <dig> . thus, these results strongly suggested that bplo displayed a higher ba-producing activity than the previously characterized crao and cyp716a <dig>  on the other hand, like the results shown in fig.  <dig>  the unknown products  were also observed in this experiment. interestingly, compared to crao and cyp716a <dig>  bplo resulted in relatively higher levels of the peak  <dig> while lower amounts of the peak  <dig> , which pattern was very similar to that of these los’ activities on the ba pathway. this data may also reflect the truth that bplo catalyzes a higher c28-oxidizing activity toward lupeol or lupeol-like compounds than crao and cyp716a <dig> fig.  <dig> comparison of the ba-producing activities between bplo and the previously reported los  in yeast. the lo genes were individually co-expressed with atlup <dig> in the wat <dig> yeast strain. a total ion chromatograms were shown for the products by expressing bplo, crao and cyp716a15; b the relative amounts of the products lupeol , betulin , and betulinic acid  produced by the transgenic yeast cells expressing the individual lo. “lup/bn + ba + lup” represents the ratio of the yield of the total products  divided by the lup yield. similarly, “bn/bn + ba + lup” and “ba/bn + ba + lup” represent the ratios of the total product yield divided by the yield of bn and ba, respectively. error bars represent the standard errors of the means calculated from two biological replicates



the wat <dig> strain was better than the cen.pk strain to host ba pathway
the yeast strain cen.pk was demonstrated to be a triterpene hyper producer  <cit> , which prompted us to expect that the strain cen. pk would be a better host to engineer the biosynthesis of ba. thus, the strain cen.pk was then investigated for its ba-producing ability compared to the wat <dig> yeast strain. the wat <dig> strain contains the gemonically integrated atr <dig>  <cit>  that is required for the activity of bplo. the exactly same atr <dig> expression cassette was amplified from the wat <dig> strain and integrated into the chromosome of the cen.pk strain to generate the strain cen.pk-atr <dig> via an integrative expression vector prs <dig>  for a fair comparison, the empty vector prs <dig> was also integrated into the wat <dig> strain to give the strain wat11- <dig>  the ba pathway was then integrated into both the wat11- <dig> and cen.pk-atr <dig> strains, generating the strains of wat11-406-lb and cen.pk-atr1-lb, respectively. the integrated yeast strains were cultured for assessing their ba-producing abilities. there were no significant differences in their growth curves of both strains . after the galactose-induction for  <dig> days, the yeast cells and medium were partitioned by centrifugation and separately extracted with ethyl acetate for gc-ms analysis. the bplo products  were majorly detected in the medium whereas very low amounts of them accumulated within the cells of both strains , suggesting that both strains were able to highly transport the products out of cells. for the products in the medium, wat <dig> strain accumulated about 3-fold higher ba levels and relatively lower amount of bn compared to the cen.pk strain , suggesting that the wat <dig> strain had a more efficient conversion of bn to ba than the cen.pk strain. on the other hand, compared to the wat <dig> strain, a significantly higher level of lupeol accumulated in the cen.pk strain . the total yields of lupeol, bn and ba would reflect the carbon fluxes through the ba pathway. the data of the fig.  <dig> indicated that wat <dig> strain provided greater metabolic fluxes through the ba pathway than the cen.pk strain. thus, further engineering of the ba production of this study was performed based on the wat <dig> stain.fig.  <dig> comparison of cen.pk and wat <dig> strains for their ba-producing abilities. a the growth properties of the both strains measured by checking the optical density at the wave length of 600; b the ba-producing abilities of the both strains measured by calculating the yields of lupeol , betulin  and betulinic acid . error bars represent the standard errors of the means calculated from three biological replicates



the inactivation of gal80p improved the ba yield based on the wat <dig> strain
in this study, the ba pathway genes were all cloned under the control of galactose-inducible promoters and their transcriptions are galactose-inducible. the induction of gal genes is controlled by the protein complex of gal3p, gal4p and gal80p  <cit> . the expression level of gal genes could be increased in the gal <dig> mutant when using non-inducing carbon source  <cit> . it has also been reported that the loss of gal80p function in yeast improved carotenoid production when the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway genes were cloned under galactose inducible promoters  <cit> . based on the ba-producing strain of this study, we also investigated the effect of the gal <dig> mutation on the ba production. using homologous and loxp sites-based specific recombinations, the gal80p inactivation was made based on the wat11-lb strain, which was confirmed by genomic dna pcrs . the mutant strain was then independently cultured using 2 % glucose or 2 % galactose as the carbon sources. as a control, the corresponding wild type strain wat11-lb was cultured in the same ways. on 2 % glucose, the growth property of the mutant resembled that of the wild strain  and the ba production was hardly detected whether or not the gal80p was inactivated . on 2 % galactose, the ba production from the mutant was  <dig>  fold higher than that of the wild strain, suggesting that the gal80p disruption improved the expressions of the ba pathway genes, which were cloned under the control of galactose inducible promoters. this assumption was proved by the gene expression analysis of the bplo gene from both the mutant and the wild strain by real-time pcrs .fig.  <dig> yeast growth properties a and betulinic acid production b were compared between the wild type strain  and the gal80p mutant . 80-gal, the mutant strain cultured under 2 % galactose; w-gal, the wild type strain cultured under 2 % galactose; 80-glu, the mutant strain cultured under 2 % glucose; w-glu, the wild type strain cultured under 2 % glucose. error bars represent the standard errors of the means calculated from three biological replicates



discussion
the success of engineering the ba production in yeast cells has previously been reported by our group  <cit> . in the present study, we attempted to increase the ba yields in yeast using multiple strategies, which include the identification of a higher ba-producing enzyme, the assessment of two different yeast strains, and the increase of the ba pathway gene transcriptions. the bark of white birch is the major source for the ba production, while the ba-producing enzymes in this species have never been reported before this study. using a homology-based strategy, we have successfully isolated the gene encoding a novel lo enzyme  from white birch bark. compared with the previously reported los, bplo produced the most ba while the lowest bn , suggesting that bplo exhibits a higher activity of converting bn to ba than the other los.

previously, the s. cerevisiae cen.pk strain was revealed to contain higher levels of ergosterol than other s. cerevisiae strains  <cit> . we also observed that the concentration of ergosterol in cen.pk strain is higher than that in the wat <dig> strain . ergosterol is derived from  <dig> -oxidosqualene which is also a precursor for the biosynthesis of ba, thus, we initially anticipated that the cen.pk strain might be a better strain for the ba-production. however, the comparison of the yield of the total products  between both strains  indicated that the wat <dig> strain had greater metabolic fluxes through the ba-pathway than the cen.pk strain. moreover, the ratios between the individual products suggested that the wat <dig> strain was more efficient than the strain cen.pk in the conversion of bn to ba . given the relatively comparable cell densities of both strains , it appeared that the better strain for engineering the ba-production is the wat <dig> rather than the cen.pk. both strains differ in many respects, the mechanism by which the wat <dig> strain performed better for the ba-production is not clear.

in the current study, the ba pathway genes were cloned under the control of galactose inducible promoters. it is well accepted that a protein complex of gal3p, gal4p and gal80p involve in managing the gal gene transcriptions, and of which the gal80p acts as an inhibitor in transcribing the gal genes  <cit> . on the basis of the wat11-lb strain which bears the ba-pathway, the disruption of the gal80p gene caused a higher transcript level of the bplo gene on 2 % galactose , which ultimately increased the ba levels . when the gal80p was inactivated, its inhibiting effects on galactose-dependent gene inductions might be alleviated, resulting in relatively higher transcriptions of the ba pathway genes in the mutant than those in the wild strain. however, when 2 % glucose was used as the sole carbon source, the ba production was inhibited, and this inhibition seemed not to be unlocked upon the gal80p disruption . this data is reasonable because that the gal gene regulation via the gal80p depends on the presence of galactose while not glucose  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the lupeol c- <dig> oxidase from b. platyphylla  exhibited higher activities in ba biosynthesis, comparing to the previously reported los. the yeast strain wat <dig> strain was better to host ba biosynthesis than the cen.pk strain. based on the ba-producing wat <dig> strain, the gal80p mutant improved the ba biosynthesis up to  <dig>  folds relative to the wild type strain.
