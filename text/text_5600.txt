BACKGROUND
the annexins constitute a family of highly conserved proteins that are characterized by their ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipids  <cit> . annexins are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and implicated in various extra- and intracellular processes including mitogenic signal transduction, differentiation and membrane trafficking events  <cit> . however, the exact biological role of each annexin remains unknown.

in myocardial tissue, annexins a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> are particularly abundant  <cit> . anxa <dig> is the most abundant annexin in myocardium  <cit> . it is involved in exocytosis, membrane trafficking and ca2+ signaling  <cit> . conflicting reports demonstrated that it is increased at the onset of heart failure in guinea pig  <cit>  and slightly increased or remain unchanged in failing human hearts  <cit> . transgenic mice overexpressing anxa <dig> developed dilated cardiomyopathy  <cit> , impaired cardiac contractility and showed enhanced intracellular ca2+ turnover  <cit> . in contrast, anxa <dig> null mice displayed increased rate of ca2+ removal in myocytes and enhanced contractility  <cit> .

annexins are exemplified by a bipartite organization of a unique n terminal domain and c terminal core domain that varies in length and amino acid composition. the n terminal region is thought to confer functional diversity to the annexin protein. the c terminal domain is formed by either a four or eightfold  repeats of approximately  <dig> amino acid, each repeat carrying a ca2+ binding site  <cit> .

the mechanism by which anxa <dig> alters contractile functions at the cellular level is not clear. we hypothesized that anxa <dig> might physically interact with the sarcomeric proteins in cardiomyocytes to alter the contractile functions of heart. therefore, to gain insight into the functional role of anxa <dig>  we have analysed its interacting partners by mass spectrometry and examined the functional significance of anxa <dig> knockdown in cardiomyocytes.

RESULTS
binding partners of anxa <dig> in heart
to identify the potential interacting proteins of anxa <dig> in heart, in vitro binding of whole heart homogenate  proteins with gst-anxa <dig> fusion protein was conducted . the solubilised whh was applied to gst-anxa <dig> bound glutathione-sepharose 4b beads. the proteins not retained by gst-anxa <dig> were mostly removed during washing and those bound to gst-anxa <dig> were eluted  and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. the mass spectrometry analysis showed that α-actinin was one of the major proteins bound to gst-anxa <dig> . therefore, it is apparent that α-actinin might be a potential interacting partner of anxa <dig> in the heart. however, the other proteins obtained by mass spectrometry were also likely to interact with anxa <dig> since those too were retained by gst-anxa <dig> .

to validate the interaction of anxa <dig> with α-actinin in cardiomyocytes, immunoblotting analysis of gst-anxa <dig> pull-down fraction with anti sarcomeric α-actinin antibody was conducted. as shown in figure  <dig>  the gst-anxa <dig> pull-down fraction of the whh showed the presence of α-actinin. since anxa <dig> is a phospholipid binding protein and α-actinin is known to bind with phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate   <cit> , we examined whether binding of anxa <dig> with α-actinin in heart homogenate depends on pip <dig>  in vitro binding assay clearly demonstrates that delipidation of heart homogenate does not influence interaction of anxa <dig> with α-actinin .

to further validate the interaction of anxa <dig> with α-actinin, whh was directly subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti sarcomeric α-actinin antibody followed by western blotting with anxa <dig> antibody. as shown in figure  <dig>  anxa <dig> was present in the immunoprecipitate indicating that these two proteins interact in vivo. to search for the domains of anxa <dig> that could serve for the interaction with α-actinin, in vitro binding assay was conducted using various deletion mutants of gst-anxa <dig> fusion proteins . as shown in figure 2b, sds-page analysis followed by in vitro binding experiment with gst fused proteins exhibited significant binding to α-actinin with anxa <dig>  or mutants lacking domains c1-c <dig> . however, the interaction between anxa <dig> and α-actinin was completely abolished in the anxa <dig> mutants lacking domains n1-n <dig> .

localization of gfp-anxa <dig> and its deletion mutants in cardiomyocytes
to examine the subcellular localization of anxa <dig> in cardiomyocytes, gfp-anxa <dig> was introduced into neonatal rat ventricular myocytes  and visualized under fluorescence microscope after  <dig> hrs. as shown in figure 3a, gfp-anxa <dig> was localized to the cytoskeletal structure, which closely resembles the z discs typically seen in cardiomyocytes. however, gfp-anxa <dig> Δn <dig> was mostly localized to the nucleus whereas gfp-anxa <dig> Δc <dig> was localized to the cytosol and appeared to be large aggregates or vesicles.

to examine whether knock down of anxa <dig> expression alters z-band organization, nrvm were transfected with anxa <dig> shrna  or scrambled sequence  and after  <dig> h subjected to immunofluorescence with anti-sarcomeric α-actinin antibody. as shown in figure 3b, the striated pattern in cardiomyocytes remained unaffected when anxa <dig> was knocked down.

co-localization of anxa <dig> with α-actinin in cardiomyocytes
the interaction of anxa <dig> with α-actinin in situ was examined in nrvm by immunofluorescence microscopy. the pattern of anxa <dig> localization in cardiomyocytes was similar to α-actinin and both displayed striated distribution similar to z-discs of sarcomere . the extent of co-localization was enumerated by generating the line profiles of fluorescence intensities of tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate  for α-actinin and fluorescein isothiocyanate  for anxa <dig> . these fluorescence profiles demonstrates  the parallel pattern of spatial distribution of anxa <dig> and α-actinin signals, indicating a high degree of co-localization of these two proteins, which was further strengthened by pearson's correlation coefficient as high as  <dig>  ±  <dig> , obtained from co-localization analysis.

involvement of anxa <dig> in cardiomyocyte contractility
to consider the mechanistic effect of anxa <dig> in cardiomyocytes, adult rat ventricular myocytes were  transfected with anxa <dig> shrna  or scrambled sequence . mechanical properties were studied in gfp-positive cardiomyocytes using video-based edge detection system  as described in the "methods" section. anxa <dig> shrna transfected cells exhibited a significant increase in percent shortening , rate of contraction   and rate of relaxation   as compared to control cells.

discussion
the present study demonstrates anxa <dig> to be a member of the z-disc and its involvement in cardiomyocyte contractility. therefore, altered level of anxa <dig> might impair cardiac excitation and contraction cycles, which could explain the contractile abnormality in anxa <dig> transgenic as well as knockout mice  <cit> . though the histochemical localization of anx <dig> has been reported in guinea pig heart  <cit> , the present study clearly demonstrates that anxa <dig> physically interacts with α-actinin. it is known that α-actinin helps in crosslinking of actin in cardiomyocytes and is an important component of the contractile unit i.e. sarcomere  <cit> .

since anxa <dig> mutant lacking residues 1- <dig> amino acids   fails to bind with α-actinin in whh, it is likely that this region of anxa <dig> plays a critical role in mediating binding with α-actinin. on the other hand, residues 435- <dig> aa, which include domains c1-c <dig> and c terminal tail, are not involved in this interaction; since the deletion of these residues does not have any effect on in vitro binding. it has been demonstrated earlier that anxa <dig> acts as the binding partner of calspectin and regulates bundling of f-actin in vitro  <cit> . recently, it has also been shown that anxa <dig> interacts with actin exclusively through its n terminal domain in cardiomyocytes  <cit> . it has been demonstrated earlier that anxa <dig> is predominantly located at the sarcolemma and intercalated discs as revealed by the transverse sections of the left ventricle  <cit> . however, the exact subcellular localization of anxa <dig> in isolated myocytes was not known. the present study clearly demonstrates the localization of anxa <dig> in the z-disc of cardiomyocytes. furthermore, we specifically show that anxa <dig> interacts with α-actinin in vitro as well as in vivo, through its n terminus. therefore, it is likely that binding of anxa <dig> to cardiac sarcomere is mediated via its n terminal domains through α-actinin. interestingly, z-band organization in cardiomyocytes is not altered when anxa <dig> is knocked down. therefore, absence of anxa <dig> does not alter the structural organization of the sarcomeric z-lines.

interaction of anxa <dig> Δc <dig> with α-actinin shown by in vitro binding experiment indicates that residues required for binding with α-actinin is retained in the purified mutant. though, in vitro binding experiment shows interaction of gst-anxa <dig> Δc <dig> with α-actinin, it is not clear why the mutant fails to localize to z-discs in situ. such discrepancy appears to be restricted to in vitro/in vivo situations solely. yet, it is plausible that deletion of c terminal sequences affects translocation process of anxa <dig> into the z-disc. moreover, in situ over-expression of this mutant most likely induces irregular accumulation of juxtanuclear vesicles of the mutant protein.

it is evident that interaction of anxa <dig> with α-actinin occurs via n terminal domain and hence gfp-anxa <dig> Δn <dig> fails to localize to z-disc when overexpressed in cardiomyocytes. however, it is not clear why this mutant is localized to nucleus. nuclear localization of anxa <dig> in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of cardiac origin has been reported earlier  <cit> . in the present study localization of gfp-anxa <dig> Δn <dig> to the nucleus may be due to the structural transition in the mutant protein regulating its transport and import into the nucleus.

the cytoskeleton of the heart muscle cell is crucially important for the contractile function of the heart. the basic contractile unit of cardiomyocyte is the sarcomere. actin filaments are directly connected to the z-disc of the sarcomere. α-actinin is an important actin cross-linking molecule, which exists as an anti-parallel homodimer and orients the actin-binding domains at opposite ends, allowing each dimer to bind two actin filaments, leading to the formation of bundles  <cit> . the cytoplasmic ca2+ binds to troponin c, moving the tropomyosin complex off the actin-binding site allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin filament during cardiac excitation and contraction. the intracellular connections between the z-disc of the sarcomere and the sacolemma allow transmission of force developed by the myofilaments  <cit> . here we clearly demonstrate the localization of anxa <dig> in the z-disc of sarcomere in cardiomyocytes via the mediation of α-actinin.

in vivo experiments reported impaired cardiac contractility in anxa <dig> transgenic mice whereas enhanced contractility was observed in cardiomyocytes isolated from anxa <dig> knock out mice . consistent with these in vivo observations here we show that transient knock down of anxa <dig> significantly  augments percent shortening, rate of shortening  and rate of relengthening  as compared to control cardiomyocytes indicating that contractility of cardiomyocytes is enhanced. hence, anxa <dig> likely serves as a regulator of cardiac contractility by its association with the contractile proteins in cardiomyocyte. therefore, interaction of anxa <dig> with α-actinin signifies its potential role in cardiac mechano-transduction.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is a maiden report showing the spatial co-localization and physical interactions of anxa <dig> with sarcomeric α-actinin. the functional significance of such interaction might be important for regulating contractile properties of cardiomyocytes. thus, anxa <dig> may have a significant role in cardiac pathophysiology.
