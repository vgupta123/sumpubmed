BACKGROUND
hantaviruses are zoonotic and emerging pathogens for humans with rodent and other small mammal reservoirs  <cit> . currently, hantaviruses are known to occur in two rodent families , in two families of insectivores  and in three families of bats   <cit> . all hantaviruses seem to be associated exclusively with one or a few closely related mammal reservoir species and mostly follow the geographical distribution of the reservoir  <cit> .

in europe, five rodent-borne hantaviruses  and four insectivore-borne hantaviruses  have been identified  <cit> . according to current knowledge, only some rodent-borne hantaviruses cause significant disease in humans. infections occur via inhalation of aerosolised virus particles, which are shed through urine, faeces or saliva. hantavirus disease, namely haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome , occurs in eurasia and has been known since the 1930s  <cit> . puumala virus  is the most important hantavirus in northern, central and western europe  <cit> . puuv-caused disease in humans is termed nephropatica epidemica , which is a mild to moderate form of hfrs. the disease is mainly characterized by renal dysfunction or renal failure. main symptoms are fever, headache, backpain and gastrointestinal symptoms  <cit> . the much more severe hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is restricted to the americas  <cit> .

the first detection of puuv in germany was in the 1980s during a belgian military exercise  <cit> . since  <dig>  human hantavirus infections have been notifiable in germany and a total of  <dig>  cases were recorded until december  <dig> . the geographical distribution of human cases in germany is heterogeneous, with the majority reported from highly endemic regions in southern, western and north-western germany . in outbreak years, the number of human ne cases rises to about  <dig> in germany .

the bank vole  is the main, and in central europe exclusive, reservoir of the puuv. the species is distributed all over germany and in many other european and asian countries. in central europe it inhabits mainly deciduous broad-leaved forests of oak  and beech   <cit> , but can also occur in hedges, parks, and urban gardens. in temperate forests, food availability for bank voles fluctuates greatly because of seed masting of beech and other tree species, which is triggered by climatic conditions . during beech mast years, bank vole populations grow rapidly reaching peak population densities the following year . earlier studies show that in european broad-leaved forests, bank vole populations fluctuate seasonally and multi-annually with population peaks in summer and population outbreaks every 4–7 years  <cit> . more recent studies demonstrate bank vole outbreaks every 2–3 years  <cit>  due to shortening beech mast intervals  <cit> . the increase in the number of human puuv infections is associated with bank vole population peaks  <cit> . however, the interplay of vole and hantavirus dynamics is much less understood and this may be crucial for hantavirus transmission within host populations ultimately affecting human infection risk. due to the potentially severe course of the disease and the large number of people affected, understanding the occurrence of human puuv infections is highly relevant for public health management.

we present the results of a temporally and spatially replicated live trapping study of bank vole populations that link the presence of puuv specific antibodies in bank voles to their population dynamics, space use and survival. patterns of bank vole population dynamics are presented for four, and puuv dynamics for two, geographical regions  in germany from  <dig> to  <dig> covering two vole outbreaks. results may be relevant for a future development of an early warning system to minimize the risk of hantavirus infections and related adverse effects on public health in central europe.

methods
rodent trapping
rodent monitoring was conducted in spring, summer, and autumn of 2010– <dig> in four study areas in germany; west , south , north , and east . habitats surveyed were mainly beech forests or mixed deciduous forests.

ugglan multiple live traps  were baited with apple, rodent pellets, rolled oats and peanut curls and wood shavings were provided for insulation. on each plot, a trap grid of  <dig>  traps with 10 m spacing was set. traps were pre-baited for 3 days and checked twice a day for 2– <dig> consecutive days, in the early morning and late afternoon. thus, each trapping session consisted of multiple  trapping occasions. in total, three replicate woodland plots per study area   and trapping session were sampled. every captured vole was marked with a passive integrated transponder  tag  for individual identification in the scruff. species and sex were morphologically determined and animals were weighed to the nearest gram with a 50 g-spring scale . blood samples  were taken from the facial vein or the retro-orbital sinus and stored at −20 °c until analysis for puuv-specific antibodies. after processing, animals were released at the point of capture.

density estimation
bank vole populations were assumed to be closed because immigration, emigration, births and mortality were thought to be minimal during a 3 day trapping period. closed population densities were estimated using program density  <dig>   with the spatial detection model secr  using maximum likelihood . if recapture rates or movement were too limited to calculate density estimates, the minimum number alive multiplied by the trapping area  was used. density estimates are stated as individuals per hectare throughout.

serological puuv analyses
blood was analysed in an immunoglobulin g  enzyme linked immunosorbent assay , which uses a yeast-expressed puuv nucleocapsid protein to test for puuv antibody presence in the sample. the investigations followed a previously established protocol  <cit> . scoring of reactivities  followed a previously described decision tree  <cit> . in further analyses explicit positive or negative results were required, hence equivocal test results were classified as negative. for each state and season mean seroprevalences ± standard deviation were calculated from plots where > <dig> samples were obtained.

space use
the minimum distance moved among traps during a trapping session divided by the number of recaptures was used as a measure of space use to investigate potential cause and consequence of puuv infection in bank voles  <cit> . animals with first captures in the traps at the margin of the trapping grid were excluded to avoid edge effects  <cit>  and to increase the probability of including grid residents. individuals captured only once were excluded from the analysis because no information about movement was available.

seroconversion and survival
recaptured bank voles, which were tested for puuv-specific antibodies in a preceding session, could be identified by their individual marking. this allowed studying seroconversion rates and survival in relation to puuv infection status. seroconversion is defined as the occurrence of puuv-specific antibodies in animals found to be seronegative during previous trapping.

statistical analyses
bank vole population density and puuv seroprevalence
annual and seasonal fluctuations in population density as well as puuv seroprevalence were analysed by univariate analyses of variance  with subsequent post hoc tests . population density or puuv seroprevalence were dependent variables and year, season as well as study area fixed factors. analyses were performed using r software . level of significance was α < 5%.

correlation of puuv seroprevalence and bank vole population density
the influence of bank vole population density on puuv-seroprevalence was statistically analysed using a generalized linear mixed model  with binomial distribution and a logit link function  using r software. puuv seroprevalence as a proportional response variable  was generated from the number of puuv seropositive bank voles and the difference between the number of tested bank voles and the number of puuv seropositive bank voles . population density and the density of the previous session /sd)), both in interaction with season , were included as covariates. plot nested in study area and year were included as random factors. further, an observation-level random effect was added to account for overdispersion  <cit> , which was tested a priori using package ‘blmeco’ and function ‘dispersion_glmer’. the number of observations was n =  <dig> and the best model was chosen according to akaike information criterion . we used function ‘r.squaredglmm’ from the ‘mumin’-package to estimate a pseudo-r <dig> for glmms   <cit> .

space use
individual differences in space use were investigated under the premise to be either the cause or consequence of puuv infection. for this the effect of the mean minimum distance moved between recaptures on puuv infection status  was analysed with a glmm with binomial distribution and a logit link function  using r software. puuv infection status was the dependent variable and ‘mean minimum distance moved’ the fixed factor. plot nested in study area was included as a random factor. the number of observations was n =  <dig> 

further, the effect of puuv infection status on the mean minimum distance moved between recaptures  was analysed with a glmm with gamma distribution and a log link function  using r software. the dependent variable ‘mean minimum distance moved’ was transformed by adding  <dig>  m to each value to eliminate zero values. in the initial model, puuv infection status, sex, weight, interaction of sex as well as weight with puuv infection status, and season were included as covariates. plot nested in study area was included as a random factor. the number of observations was n =  <dig> and the best model was chosen according to aic.

seroconversion and survival
changes in puuv infection status of recaptures  were analysed by chi square tests . analyses were performed using spss . level of significance was α < 5%.

survival of bank voles was analysed by a glmm with binomial distribution and a logit link function  using r software  and ‘lsmeans’  packages). survival  was the dependent variable and puuv infection status, sex, weight, interaction of sex as well as weight with puuv infection status, and season were the initial fixed factors. plot nested in study area was included as a random factor. the number of observations was n =  <dig> and the best model was chosen according to aic.

RESULTS
population density
in total  <dig> bank voles were trapped during 2010– <dig> which were roughly equally distributed among study areas. population density tended to increase from spring to summer or autumn . there were statistically significant differences in population densities between years  and seasons  but not between study areas . in  <dig> and  <dig>  population densities were significantly higher than in  <dig> and  <dig> . population density in summer was significantly higher compared to spring  but not to autumn  or between spring and autumn . however, maximum densities were observed in summer of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicating bank vole population outbreaks. the highest bank vole population density was estimated for summer  <dig> in the south with on average  <dig> ind/ha . in spring  <dig> and  <dig> population densities were lowest with 1– <dig> ind/ha  and 0– <dig> ind/ha .fig.  <dig> population dynamics of bank voles in germany from  <dig> to  <dig>  estimated mean population densities ± standard deviation as individuals per hectare from three replicate woodland plots per study area 




puuv seroprevalence
 <dig> bank voles were tested for puuv-reactive antibodies of which  <dig>  were puuv seropositive. almost 99%  of those puuv-seropositive bank voles were trapped in the south or west. in the north and east only  <dig> bank voles were tested positive in the puuv igg elisa. hence, puuv is most likely not present at the trapping sites in north and east, which is in accordance with a large-scale study on bank voles from eastern germany  <cit> . drewes et al.  <cit>  sampled about  <dig> snap-trapped voles from multiple sites in germany partly overlapping with the sites north and east from this study. all voles were puuv-negative in igg elisa, conventional and real-time rt-pcr. therefore, the positive test results from the two study areas reported here were most probably due to spillover infections of puuv-related tula virus  or false positive reactions in the elisa. because of the general absence of puuv, north and east were not further included in data analyses regarding puuv seroprevalence in bank voles.

serological investigations were performed for  <dig> bank voles from west and south. seroprevalence did not vary between study areas  but significantly differed between seasons  and years  . seroprevalences in  <dig> and  <dig> were significantly higher compared to  <dig> and  <dig> . seroprevalence in spring was significantly higher compared to autumn  but not to summer  or between summer and autumn . however, highest seroprevalence was found in spring  <dig>  and  <dig> . in these years, seroprevalence further decreased from spring to summer and from summer to autumn. in  <dig> and  <dig>  the rate of puuv-seropositive individuals in spring was much lower , and even zero, compared to the previous year. during those years, puuv seroprevalence remained at a low or zero level or slightly increased towards autumn.fig.  <dig> puuv seroprevalence in bank vole populations in two regions in germany from  <dig> to  <dig>  mean seroprevalence ± standard deviation  in spring, summer and autumn each year estimated from three replicate woodland plots per study area. numerical values per season are total numbers of tested individuals of all plots in each study area




correlation of puuv seroprevalence and bank vole population density
we performed a glmm to test for the effect of bank vole population density on the variance in puuv seroprevalence within populations. the higher the bank vole population density in a trapping session in spring the higher the puuv seroprevalence   . a similar but weaker relation was found in summer , but not in autumn   . there was no effect of the interaction of population density of the previous trapping session and season on puuv seroprevalence . the random factor plot nested in study area  did not explain the variance in puuv seroprevalence, but year did . the best model explained almost one-third of the variance in puuv seroprevalence .fig.  <dig> seasonal effects of bank vole population density  on puuv seroprevalence in the host population. black bars on x-axis represent the distribution of population density values per trapping session

analysing the effect of space use as a cause for puuv infections in bank voles using a glmm showed no significant effect of the mean minimum distance moved on puuv infection status . the random factor plot nested in study area  could explain only a small portion of the variance in the probability of puuv infection  .table  <dig> model results of glmms investigating space use as cause  or consequence  of puuv infections in bank voles

we also performed a glmm to test for the effect of puuv infection status on the mean minimum distance moved . first of all, model selection excluded season, weight as well as all interactions from further consideration. no significant effect of puuv infection status on space use was found  , although the mean minimum distance moved was  <dig> % longer for individuals without puuv-reactive antibodies . males tended to move farther distances than females  . the random factor plot nested in study area  could not explain the variance in the mean minimum distance moved.

seroconversion and survival
most individuals trapped more than once were captured in two  and some in three  or four  trapping sessions. we recorded a total of  <dig> recaptures of individuals in multiple seasons. usually, recaptures occurred in the following trapping session, but in two cases , voles first captured in summer were not recorded in autumn, but recaptured in the next spring. in both study areas, females were more frequently recaptured than males .

most recaptures remained seronegative  followed by bank voles that stayed seropositive  . in the west  <dig>  of recaptures indicated a puuv seroconversion. in the south  <dig> voles  seroconverted . two voles in the west  and  <dig> voles in the south  converted from seropositive to seronegative. more females than males remained seronegative  or seropositive . there was no sex difference in seroconversion .fig.  <dig> number of recaptured bank voles. recaptures per study area  in total and per sex  subdivided in recaptures that remained seronegative  or seropositive , seroconverted  or seemed to have lost antibodies 




most recaptures occurred in  <dig> and  <dig> . seasonal variation in survival rates  mirrored fluctuations in bank vole population density in outbreak years with peaks in summer . a glmm was performed to investigate the effect of puuv infection status on survival of bank voles. first of all, the model showed significantly lower survival occurring from autumn to spring  in comparison to within year survival from spring to summer and summer to autumn . this was most probably due to trapping intervals between seasons . hence, separate glmms were performed for each season.fig.  <dig> survival rates of bank voles according to puuv seroprevalence. mean values ± standard deviation per season of first capture




model selection excluded weight from further consideration in each season and all interactions in autumn . from spring to summer, survival was significantly higher for puuv-seropositive voles   but did not vary between sexes. from summer to autumn, survival was significantly lower for seropositive  males  in comparison to seropositive or seronegative  females   on the survival of bank voles

discussion
the processes involved in hantavirus transmission have been mostly studied in northern europe  <cit> . knowledge about mechanisms in central europe is sparse . with our recent study, we covered two spatially replicated bank vole outbreaks  and two low phases , which is likely to provide robust estimation of relevant patterns and processes.

population dynamics of bank voles in central europe are driven by seed masting of beech trees . as beech mast events have recently occurred every 2–3 years  <cit> , bank vole outbreaks have also occured every 2–3 years. this 2–3 year cycle has a major effect on puuv dynamics within the rodent host population and hence on the number of human puuv infections.

in our study, puuv seroprevalence  temporally fluctuated depending on host population abundance. highest seroprevalences were found in  <dig> and  <dig>  when rodent host abundance peaked  triggered by beech mast events in  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , and coincided with the highest numbers of human puuv infections ever recorded since the disease became notifiable in  <dig> . in bank vole outbreak years, puuv seroprevalence peaked in spring, when populations consisted of old overwintered animals  <cit> . these animals most probably die by summer, leading in part to the decrease in puuv seroprevalence, although population density increases  <cit> . further, despite increasing absolute numbers of infected individuals, puuv seroprevalence decreases  indicating that population growth rate outperforms transmission rate in peak reproductive phase. hence, uninfected young of the year lower puuv seroprevalence during the year  <cit>  . accordingly, this decrease in puuv seroprevalence was observed to proceed until autumn. in  <dig> and  <dig>  when bank vole densities collapsed in the west and south, seroprevalence also drastically decreased.

density-dependence of virus occurrence in the rodent host population was demonstrated for hantavirus . however, we found also clear differences in puuv seroprevalence among seasons. there was a strong direct density-dependence in spring. this might be due to the presence of many overwintered individuals that contracted puuv in the previous year or during winter and represent the founder population for the upcoming outbreak, while in years with smaller spring populations , puuv seroprevalence was much lower. in summer, when uninfected newborns without maternal antibodies  enter the population, puuv seroprevalence is lowered  and consequently density-dependence was decreased, but still significant. in autumn, there was no density effect and density-dependence seems to be diluted over the course of the year likely due to a more complex transmission scenario during the reproduction phase based on reproductive behaviour . our data underlines the dependence of puuv seroprevalence on seasonal and multi-annual density dynamics of the rodent host in central-europe  <cit> .

considerable temporal variation and the geographic differences in host and virus dynamics were detected indicating that the puuv-bank vole-human epidemiological system is even more complex than previously assumed. perhaps most strikingly, puuv is virtually absent from the german east and north although bank voles are present  <cit>  and fluctuations in abundance are also related to beech masting  <cit> . bank voles in the north and east belong to the eastern and carpathian evolutionary lineages, whereas bank voles in the south and west belong to the western evolutionary lineage  <cit> . the almost complete absence of puuv-seroreactive bank voles in the current study from sites in north and east is in line with results of a previous study where bank voles from northern and eastern parts of germany were found to be free of puuv as determined by igg-elisa and rt-pcr analyses  <cit> . the puuv absence in the eastern and northern part of germany is caused by the association of puuv with the western evolutionary lineage of the bank vole and its distribution following the postglacial recolonization of germany  <cit> . the few puuv-seroreactive bank voles found in the current study are probably the result of spillover infections, most likely by tulv. tulv is the only hantavirus present in other vole species which is antigenically closely related to puuv and puuv- and tulv-specific antibodies cannot be differentiated by elisa  <cit> . however, spillover infections seem to occur only rarely   <cit>  and hence did not affect the present results.

male bank voles move farther than female bank voles  <cit> , which could not be confirmed statistically in our study, although males seemed to be more mobile . more active males are more prone to infection  <cit> , which could lead to the hypothesis that puuv seroprevalence is positively correlated with space use causing an increased infection probability. nevertheless, no effect of space use as a cause for puuv infections in bank voles could be found. a reverse connection of both parameters  might indicate a possible sublethal effect on rodent host fitness  as a consequence of puuv infection. however, an effect of puuv infection status on space use could not be detected, which contrasts with earlier findings that puuv infection affects host fitness with regards to survival and reproduction  <cit> . in general, shorter mean minimum distances moved seem to be associated with a higher probability of puuv infection in bank voles , but it remains unclear whether puuv infections affects spatial activity or vice versa. the individual movement data generated by recapture studies are rather crude and more detailed data from telemetry work is needed to further elucidate cause as well as consequences of puuv infection on rodent host fitness and behaviour.

the proportion of puuv-seronegative and -seropositive voles or voles with a seroconversion corresponded to earlier findings  <cit> . seroconversion in our study  was smaller compared to former results . this is most probably an effect of trapping intervals, which were mostly three months in our study and 6 months in escutenaire et al.  <cit> , decreasing the probability of seroconversion in our study. ‘inverted seroconversion’ from positive to negative in three juveniles  was most likely a consequence of loss of maternal antibodies  <cit> . although the presence of puuv-reactive antibodies is assumed to persist lifelong  <cit> , the loss of antibodies in recaptured animals might indicate a virus clearance  <cit> , as discussed also for another hantavirus  <cit> , or might be caused by an oscillation of the antibody titer below the detection limit of the elisa used.

females were more frequently recaptured than males . total capture of females was also higher than males  and can be explained by stronger territoriality of females than males  <cit> . seroconversion did not differ between sexes. hence, general assumptions that males have a higher infection risk due to their behavior  <cit>  or that females probably better survive with subject to puuv infection  <cit>  were not supported. thus, supposed effects of puuv on vole fitness  <cit>  require further investigations.

recaptures between trapping sessions reflecting survival were more frequent in outbreak years when the initial population abundance was higher. survival also followed seasonal patterns because there was higher survival at the end of the reproductive phase  for puuv seronegative and seropositive captures. over-winter survival was lowest, which is most likely an effect of trapping interval  and hence survival according to puuv infection status was analysed separately for each season. puuv-seropositive voles survived better from spring to summer, which might indicate a positive effect on host fitness. however, an alternative plausible explanation is the effect of residency. in spring, especially in outbreak years, puuv seroprevalence is increased reflected by more seropositive than seronegative voles. puuv-seropositive animals that survived are most probably local residents, which got infected in the previous year and overwintered. residents are more likely to be recaptured leading to more recapture-based survival than in seronegatives. the latter may include transient or immigrating voles that are recaptured less often than residents. from summer to autumn, puuv-seropositive males survived less compared to females of either infection status. again, this might have been an effect of residency. in summer, puuv seroprevalence is decreased and proportionally more individuals are seronegative most probably due to uninfected young voles. not only residents but also females  are more likely to be recaptured. accordingly, males are more likely to disperse, which could have led to less recaptures . over winter, no effect of puuv infection on survival was found. seasonal survival has not been explored so far. former studies investigating over-winter survival report no effect of puuv infection on survival  <cit> , but see kallio et al.  <cit> . maternal antibodies did not matter in our study because the number of juvenile recaptured with potential maternal antibodies was negligible . little is known about sublethal effects of hantavirus infection on behaviour and fitness of rodent hosts that may have consequences for survival and population dynamics. clarifying such impacts could shed light on our inconsistent findings about the relation of puuv infection status on survival such as apparent increased survival of puuv seropositives from spring to summer  and apparent decreased survival of seropositive males from summer to autumn. therefore, further research—preferably in controlled environments—is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed relevant patterns and processes in the dynamics of puuv and its rodent host in central europe. seasonal and multi-annual fluctuations of puuv seroprevalence depend on host abundance. this knowledge can facilitate the future development of early warning systems to lower the risk of human hantavirus infections.

effects of puuv infection on rodent host space use and survival could not be conclusively clarified. further research is required to test for such impacts possibly by comparing behaviour and survival between endemic and non-endemic regions.
