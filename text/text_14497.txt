BACKGROUND
chronic fatigue syndrome  is a clinical condition characterized by severe and disabling fatigue that is medically unexplained and lasts longer than  <dig> months  <cit> . the estimated worldwide prevalence of cfs is  <dig> -1%  <cit> . the existing evidence suggests that cognitive behavior therapy, specifically designed for cfs, is an effective treatment option  <cit> . however, although it is possible to effectively treat cfs, the nature of the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear.

hypotheses explaining the pathophysiological mechanism of cfs include morphological and metabolic alterations in the brain,  <cit>  diminished central activation of muscles,  <cit>  altered central nervous system functioning,  <cit>  a neuroendocrine disturbance,  <cit>  or cognitive impairment  <cit> . furthermore, the presence of an underlying immunological problem has been suggested as an explanation for cfs  <cit> . cytokine dysregulation, decreased natural killer cell functioning, the presence of autoantibodies, and a reduced response of t cells to mitogens and other specific antigens have been reported in cfs  <cit> . if immunity is disturbed in cfs patients, they might have an altered response to vaccination. vaccines, accompanying adjuvants, and silicone breast implants could act in concert in the development of cfs  <cit> . therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the humoral and cellular immune responses upon vaccination, using seasonal influenza vaccination as a model of a vaccination, in cfs patients and healthy controls.

RESULTS
baseline characteristics
baseline characteristics of the participants are presented in table  <dig> 

data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or as absolute numbers with percentages in brackets.

humoral immune response
vaccination induced a significant increase in hemagglutination-inhibition  antibody titers for influenza strain h3n <dig> and h1n <dig> in the cfs group as well as in the healthy control group . for influenza strain b, vaccination induced no significant increase in hi antibody titers, neither in the cfs, nor in the healthy control group . no significant differences in hi antibody titers between both groups were observed prior to vaccination or at day  <dig>  compared to the healthy controls, cfs patients demonstrated similar seroprotection rates  and seroresponse rates against all three virus-strains .

data are presented as absolute numbers with percentages in brackets or as mean ± standard error of the mean.

cellular immune response
prior to vaccination, t cells proliferated upon phytohemagglutinin  and virus stimulation in both cfs patients and healthy controls , indicating that these t cells are functional . cellular proliferation showed no significant differences between cfs patients and healthy controls at baseline . of note, in absolute counts, cfs patients showed at baseline a lower t cell proliferation upon stimulation in comparison with controls. interleukin- <dig>  production and the number of regulatory t lymphocytes  were not significantly different between cfs patients and healthy controls at baseline .

vaccination induced a significant increase in cellular proliferation in cfs patients after stimulation with influenza strain h3n <dig> and b, and a trend in the same direction for strain h1n <dig>  whereas in healthy controls vaccination induced no significant change in cellular proliferation after stimulation with any of the three virus-strains .

post-vaccination, t cell proliferation showed no significant differences between cfs patients and controls, neither for the three different virus strains , nor for pha . of note, in absolute counts, cfs patients showed post-vaccination more proliferating t cells upon stimulation with all three virus-strains, compared to controls. interferon gamma , interleukin- <dig> , and interleukin- <dig>  production post-vaccination were not significantly different between cfs patients and healthy controls .

discussion
to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore both the humoral and cellular immune responses after influenza vaccination in cfs patients. the hypothesized immunological aberrancy claimed to be operative in cfs could not be confirmed by our data.

both cfs patients and healthy controls showed a significant increase in humoral immune responses from pre- to post-vaccination for virus-strains h3n <dig> and h1n <dig>  virus-strain b did not show such an increase from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  but for this virus-strain the hi titer was already high prior to vaccination.

in a previous study, only the effect of influenza vaccination on the antibody response of cfs patients was determined in  <dig> cfs patients and  <dig> matched healthy volunteers  <cit> . in accordance with our study, influenza vaccination provided protective antibody levels. our study gives additional information on cellular immune responses in cfs patients.

we observed that, although not statistically significant, the incorporation of tritium thymidine by proliferating t cells at baseline was numerically lower in patients suffering from cfs in comparison to healthy controls. to investigate whether it is worthwhile to investigate this trend in more detail, we studied immunological mechanisms commonly known to suppress immunity. first, the immunosuppressive cytokine il- <dig>  which is able to inhibit t cell proliferation, was assessed  <cit> . however, production at baseline of il- <dig> was similar in patients and controls. secondly, treg are known to negatively modulate t cell responses  <cit> . nevertheless, the percentage of treg in cfs patients at baseline did not differ from the controls. another possible explanation for the decreased number of proliferating t lymphocytes in cfs patients is elevated numbers of co-inhibitory molecules, like programmed death- <dig>   <cit>  cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen- <dig>   <cit>  or b and t lymphocyte attenuator  <cit> . whether inhibitory mechanisms play a role in cfs patients need to be explored in more detail.

from pre- to post-vaccination, cfs patients showed a significant increase in cellular proliferation in two out of three virus-strains and a trend in the same direction for the third virus-strain, whereas healthy controls did not show a significant change in proliferation from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  in absolute counts, cfs patients showed post-vaccination more proliferating t cells for all three virus-strains, compared to controls. this non-significant elevation in cellular immune responses could not be explained by an increase in the levels of cytokines ifn-γ, il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  cytokines involved in the type  <dig> and type  <dig> helper t cell responses, suggesting a type  <dig> helper t cell response in cfs patients after vaccination.

limitations of the study
given the exploratory nature of this study, group sizes were relatively small and not based on power calculations. consequently, subtle differences between cfs patients and healthy controls may have gone unnoticed. however, the sample size of our study was sufficiently high to show that cfs patients are able to mount a significant protective antibody response and a sufficient cellular immune response upon a single shot of influenza vaccine.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, putative aberrations in immune responses in cfs patients were not evident for immunity towards influenza. we show that cfs patients are able to mount a protective antibody response and a sufficient cellular immune response upon a single shot of influenza vaccine, which is comparable with healthy controls. therefore, standard seasonal influenza vaccination is thus justified and, when indicated, should be recommended for patients suffering from cfs.
