BACKGROUND
grasspea  is an excellent candidate crop to provide protein and starch for human diets and animal feeds in the arid areas
 <cit> . it is one of the hardiest crops for adaptation to climate change because of its ability to survive drought, flood and salinity
 <cit> . it also plays a vital role in many low input farming systems
 <cit> . however, undesirable features such as prostrate plant habit, indeterminate growth, pod shattering, later maturity and presence of neurotoxin, β-n-oxalyl-l-α,β-diaminopropionic acid , limit its cultivation under various agro-ecological conditions
 <cit> .

to date, less than  <dig> microsatellite  markers have been published for grasspea, and only  <dig> of them were characterized for size polymorphism
 <cit> . lioi et al.,
 <cit>  searched for the presence of ssrs with the european molecular biology laboratory  nucleotide sequence database. ten out of  <dig> ssr primers were successfully amplified, and only six of them exhibited size polymorphism. in addition, ponnaiah et al.,
 <cit>  searched for est-ssrs in the national center for biotechnology information  database. seven of the  <dig> lathyrus est-ssrs and four of the  <dig> medicago est-ssrs revealed polymorphism when screening l. sativus accessions
 <cit> . sun et al.,
 <cit>  analyzed a total of  <dig>  lathyrus genus ests from the ncbi database , identified  <dig> est–ssr and designed primers to characterize for size polymorphism among  <dig> grasspea accessions. among them  <dig> ssr markers were polymorphic,  <dig> markers monomorphic and  <dig> markers with no bands
 <cit> . lioi sequenced  <dig> randomly selected clones and get  <dig> retrieving ssr containing sequences.  <dig> primer pairs produced clearly distinguishable dna banding patterns in  <dig> randomly selected ssrs, the transferability of ssr markers was high among three related species of lathyrus, namely lathyrus cicera, lathyrus ochrus and lathyrus tingitanus, and the legume crop, pisum sativum <cit> .

next generation sequencing  technologies has become popular on its success of sequencing dna at unprecedented speed thereby enabling impressive scientific achievements and novel biological applications
 <cit> . next generation rna sequencing  is rapidly replacing microarrays as the technology of choice for whole-transcriptome studies
 <cit> . rna-seq also provides a far more precise measurement of levels of transcripts and their isoforms than other methods
 <cit> . however, few studies solely focused on high-throughput novel microsatellite markers discovery of orphan crops via next generation sequencing
 <cit> .

recently, we applied next generation sequencing to obtain high-quality putative ssr loci and flanking primer sequences inexpensively and efficiently. the novel ssr sequences were characterized and validated through successful amplification of randomly selected primer pairs across a selection of  <dig> grasspea accessions and one accession of its direct ancestor red pea  as an outgroup.

methods
plant material
eight grasspea  accessions consisted of two chinese, two asian, one african and three european accessions were used for the  <dig> sequencing.

a set of  <dig> grasspea  accessions and one red pea  accession were used in ssr marker testing and genetic diversity analysis. these genetic resources contained six accessions from china, seven each from asia  and europe, and four from africa.

the seed samples were obtained from the national genebank of china at institute of crop science, chinese academy of agricultural sciences, beijing, china. details information is given in additional file

dna isolation, library preparation and  <dig> sequencing
the sprouts from each of the eight genotypes were collected and total genomic dna was isolated using the ctab method from the seven-day old seedlings grown under dark condition at 18°c. a selective hybridization with streptavidin coated bead method was used to construct ssr-enriched genomic libraries. the following eight probes were used: p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  libraries quality control was conducted by randomly selecting and sequencing  <dig> clones. the dna fragments were inserted into pgem-t easy vector, and insert fragments were validated by sanger sequencing. if the libraries had high ratio of insert fragments and most fragments length were from  <dig> to  <dig>  they were considered as high quality.

the eight ssr-enriched dna libraries were equally pooled for pyrosequencing using the  <dig> genome sequencer flx titanium system at beijing autolab biotechnology co. ltd . finally, the  <dig> system collected the data and generated standard flow gram file  which contained raw data for all the reads. then, grasspea.sff file was submitted to the sequence read archive  at the national center for biotechnology information  with the accession number srx <dig> 

reads characterization
all high quality reads were processed to remove adaptor-ligated regions using the vectorstrip program in emboss software package
 <cit> . moreover, in-house developed program such as: seqtools.pl, acgt.pl, ave_length.pl, and max.pl programs were used to analyze the total number of nucleotide a, t, c, g in all reads, the average length of all read sequences, and the maximum length read in our study.

ssrs searching
before ssrs searching, “clean reads” were filtered redundant at 98% sequence identity, using cd-hit program . a high-throughput ssr search was performed using misa  tool . the parameters were as following: minimum ssr motif length of 10 bp and repeat length of mono- <dig>  di- <dig>  tri- <dig>  tetra- <dig>  penta- <dig>  and hexa- <dig>  the maximum size of interruption allowed between two different ssr in a compound sequence was 100 bp.

ssr characterization
the misa file was used to analyse the number of sequences containing ssrs, the number of ssrs detected, the number of ssrs starting within 200 bp of read sequences, the dominant types of ssr motifs within mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa- repeats, and the ratio of single, perfect compound and interrupted compound ssrs. these characterizations were obtained by statistical analysis from the misa files
 <cit>  by a small perl program and plotted by r language
 <cit> , and openoffice.org calc.

primer pairs designing
primer pairs were designed by primer  <dig>  interface modules containing p3_in.pl primer  <dig> 
 <cit>  and p3_out.pl files . these perl scripts were used to normalize the format in order to design primers flanking the microsatellite locus. amplification product sizes ranged from  <dig> to 300 bp. then, the in-house developed script primer_random_pick.pl was used to gain the non-redundant primers.

polymerase chain reactions  amplification
for each of primer pair, pcrs were performed twice, each time with a different taq enzyme and reaction buffer. all the primer pairs were amplified in the first round experiment with 20 μl reaction volumes containing  <dig>  u of takara taq polymerase , 2 μl of  <dig> × pcr buffer ,  <dig>  μl of dntp ,  <dig>  μm primer, and 50 ng of genomic dna. then the no bands or weak bands primers were used in the second round pcr reaction using takara la taq polymerase with gc buffer  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ssrs were amplified on heijingang thermal cycler . under the following conditions: 5 min initial denaturation at 95°c; 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°c, 30 s at the optimized annealing temperature , 45 s of elongation at 72°c, and a final extension at 72°c for 10 min. pcr products were tested for polymorphism using 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver nitrate staining.

evaluation of polymorphic primers in different accessions
 <dig> ssr markers were randomly selected for validation feasibility and size polymorphism among  <dig> grasspea  genotypes from diverse geographical locations and one red pea  genotype. popgen <dig> 
 <cit>  software was used to calculate the observed number of alleles , the level of observed heterozygosity  and the shannon’s information index .

genetic diversity analysis
cluster analysis was conducted based on nei’s
 <cit>  unbiased genetic distance, by using popgen <dig> 
 <cit>  software with the unweighted pair group method on arithmetic averages  algorithm. the resulting clusters were expressed as a dendrogram drawn by mega4
 <cit> .

RESULTS
quality control during library construction
the quality of ssr enriched grasspea library was inspected by sequencing  <dig> randomly selected clones. the resulting data verified that, the recombination rate was 95%, and  <dig> sequences contained  <dig> ssr motifs within the cloned sequences.

 <dig> sequencing and characterization reads
a total of  <dig>  reads were generated from the roche  <dig> gs flx titanium platform. after adaptor removing,  <dig>  read sequences were used for further analysis. the most common nucleotide was thymidine, according for  <dig> % of total nucleotides, followed by adenosine , guanine  and cytosine . the mean gc content was  <dig> %. the average length of read sequence was 453 bp, with a maximum length of  <dig>  bp .

mining for ssrs 
firstly, we employed the program cd-hit  to produce a set of  <dig>  non-redundant representative sequences. then, microsatellite identification tool   was used for microsatellite mining. as a result,  <dig>  ssrs were identified in  <dig>  read sequences. among them,  <dig>  read sequences contained more than one ssr. the number of ssrs presenting in compound formation was  <dig>  , which meant high proportion of ssr loci  was located within compound repeats. the majority of identified ssrs  were located within 200 bp from the 5′-terminus, and few of ssrs fell into the 3′-terminus .

ssr motifs characterizing
the identified ssrs included  <dig>  mononucleotide repeat motifs,  <dig>   dinucleotide repeat motifs,  <dig>   trinucleotide repeat motifs,  <dig>   tetranucleotide repeat motifs,  <dig>   pentanucleotide repeat motifs, and  <dig>   hexanucleotide repeat motifs . thus over 95% of the motifs were di- and tri-nucleotides. the most abundant repeat motif type was n, followed by n, n, n and n, respectively .

compound ssr analysis
in our study, perfect ssrs  <dig> which were named as p <dig> type) were relatively less frequent  than the compound ssrs . in addition, there were two kinds of compound ssrs: those with interruption between two motifs 8cacacg <dig> which were named as c type); and those without interruption between two motifs  <dig> which were named as c* type). there were  <dig> c type  and  <dig> c* type  compound ssrs detected, which suggested the complexity of the grasspea genome.

primer pairs designing
a total of  <dig>  primer pairs flanking the ssrs were successfully designed using the public shareware primer  <dig>  , based on criteria of melting temperature, gc content and the lack of secondary structure. furthermore,  <dig>  non-redundant primers were achieved by in house developed programs .

validation of ssr markers
to validate the ssr sequences,  <dig> ssr primer pairs were randomly selected for pcr amplification for size polymorphism among  <dig> grasspea  genotypes from diverse geographical locations and one red pea  genotype. after two rounds of pcr amplifications,  <dig> primer pairs were confirmed of being able to amplify polymorphic based across the  <dig> genotypes ,  <dig> primer pairs were confirmed to amplify only monomorphic fragments, and  <dig> primer pairs produced no products. the number of observed alleles  ranged from two to five, the observed heterozygosity  from  <dig> to  <dig> , and shannon’s information index  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . these results indicate the broad utility of the ssr markers obtained from next-generation sequencing for future studies of grasspea genetics.

genetic diversity study
to assess the efficiency of microsatellites for differentiation of l. sativus from other lathyrus species, we chose one l. cicera accession  as outgroup in the genetic diversity study. cluster analysis based on nei’s
 <cit>  genetic distance indicated good separation between l. sativus and l. cicera. furthermore, the upgma procedure grouped most chinese accessions into one cluster; come from the center of origin, mediterranean accessions discovered the major genetic diversity in cultivated grasspea species as they spread allover, except chinese cluster . these results absolutely validated the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach for developing ssr markers in grasspea with the ngs technology.

discussion
grasspea as a potential vital crop in arid areas
frequent drought and water shortage are worldwide problems, especially for agricultural production. dryland agriculture plays an important role in national economy and food security. for example, in china, 55% of the total arable land, and 43% of the total food supplies are related to dryland agriculture. grasspea is popular among the resource poor farmers in marginal areas due to the ease with which it can be grown successfully under adverse agro-climatic conditions without much production inputs. presently at global scale, it is grown on  <dig>  million ha area with  <dig>  million tonnes production
 <cit> . in recent years, efforts are underway in many countries including china, australia, spain, italy, and canada to expand its cultivation as a break crop between cereals and as a bonus crop in fallow land because of its ability to fix large amount of atmospheric nitrogen in association with rhizobium bacteria
 <cit> . however, the presence of a neurotoxin, β-n-oxalyl-l-α,β-diaminopropionic acid , renders this crop neglected and underutilized. despite the undesirable features such as high neurotoxin, grasspea has potential as an important crop in western china and other arid areas in the world.

mining genomic ssr loci using  <dig> pyrosequencing technology
the traditional methods of microsatellite development used a library-based approach for targeted ssr repeat motifs, which was time consuming, expensive, with low-throughput. hunting in silico for est-ssrs from public database method is an alternative way, which was cost effective and easy to access. however, the total number of ests from grasspea and related species was very limited since grasspea has received less attention for molecular studies.

the identification of ssrs from genomic dna using the  <dig> pyrosequencing technology was relatively new and two strategies were published. these were shotgun sequencing
 <cit>  and ssr-enriched sequencing
 <cit> . in the present study, we used ssr-enriched sequencing technology and generated  <dig>  high quality grasspea genomic reads, with an average length of 453 bp. theoretically, the longer reads would increase our chances of successfully designing primer pairs while making it possible to identify long ssr repeats comparable to the size obtained using traditional library-based approach
 <cit> . according to the misa analysis,  <dig>  ssrs were identified from  <dig>  reads. this was a very positive result, as the high ratio of ssr-containing reads and the large number of putative ssrs we obtained. among them, di- and tri-nucleotide repeat motifs dominated the grasspea genomic sequences, similar to findings in other crops
 <cit> . n was not only the predominant di-nucleotide repeat motif, but also the most frequent motif in the entire genome, accounting for  <dig> % of the total ssrs, followed by n, n, n, while, n, n, n were rarely detected in this study. the pattern was moderately similar to that previously observed in faba bean
 <cit> . furthermore, isolated and identified low proportion of unwanted repeat motifs such as n, n, n would enhance the success ratio in designing primers.

utilization of new ssr resources for ‘orphan crop’ grasspea research
conventional breeding and phenotype research achieved great progress in improving agricultural crops in the last few years. however, grasspea was left as ‘orphan crop’ due to the lack of available genetic and genomic resources
 <cit> . the use of ssr markers as a conventional tool has played an important role in the study of genetic diversity, genetic linkage map, qtl mapping and association mapping, and paved the way to the integration of genomics for crop breeding.

due to the scarcity of user-friendly, highly polymorphic molecular markers in grasspea and other lathyrus species, high-density genetic maps were not available. in the present study, we validated  <dig> non-redundant ssr primer pairs and  <dig>  ssr primer pairs produced amplified bands, with  <dig> being polymorphic, and  <dig> monomorphic. this very large set of potential genomic-ssr markers will facilitate the construction of high-resolution maps for positional cloning and qtl mapping.

the genus lathyrus l.  is consisted of about  <dig> species
 <cit>  distributed throughout the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and extends into tropical east africa and south america
 <cit> . this study, we used  <dig> new ssr primer pairs to clearly separate the 23 l. sativus accessions from one l. cicera accession, which is in agreement with the reported phylogenic studies of lathyrus l.  based on morphological and molecular markers
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides an extensive characterization of the ssrs in grasspea genome. for the first time, large-scale ssr-enriched sequence data was generated for the identification of ssrs and development of ssr markers to accelerate basic and applied genomics research in grasspea.
