BACKGROUND
stem cells are generally defined as immature cells with self-renewal competencies and the capability of differentiating into other cell types  <cit> . stem cells may be differentiated into a wide range of mature cell types, and because of their differential potential they may be classified into two types: embryonic stem cells  and adult stem cells   <cit> . escs are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst  <cit> , whereas ascs are isolated from adult tissues and defined as multipotent, since they are determined to produce cell types within their niche  <cit> . however, recent studies suggested that ascs, especially mesenchymal stem cells  derived from bone marrow , have intrinsic neurogenic potential and may be differentiated into mature cells of ectodermal origin .

mscs are also known as stromal cells and can be readily isolated from bone marrow and expended in vitro. in fact, mscs have also been found in most postnatal organs such as the umbilical cord, adipose tissue, peripheral blood, and amniotic fluid . the trans-lineage differentiation capability and unique immunogenic properties of mscs have made them a potential alternative for cellular transplantation use in regenerative medicine  <cit> . autologous transplantation of mscs in stroke patients was proven therapeutically effective  <cit> .

recent studies have demonstrated that chemokines such as epidermal growth factor  and basic fibroblast growth factor  are crucial factors in the neurogenic differentiation of mscs  <cit> . our previous study has proved that a combination of egf, fgf- <dig>  and igf- <dig> significantly enhances long-term proliferation and survival of rat striatal neural stem cells in vitro  <cit> . no analytical studies that we know of have been undertaken to investigate the effects of igf- <dig> on neuronal induction of mscs.

therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the role of igf- <dig> in comparison with other types of growth factors that focus on stage-specific differentiation of mscs into npcs.

RESULTS
characterization of bm mscs
bm mscs have fibroblast-like morphology  and form whirlpool-like structures when grown to 80% confluence . immunofluorescence staining showed bright staining in all mscs with antibodies against cd <dig>  and cd <dig> . only  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  of cells expressed nestin . no staining was observed against markers of neuronal cell types such as sox- <dig>  gfap, and fluoropan . flow cytometry analysis further showed that bm mscs were positive for cd <dig> and cd <dig> . bm mscs were subcultured until passage  <dig> and showed consistent morphology and phenotype. the phenotypic analyses of the cells isolated are similar to those described in hong et al.  <cit> , indicating that the bm mscs isolated for our experiment met the standard criteria of mesenchymal stem cells.figure  <dig>

differentiation of bm mscs into npcs
only the cells in group e adhered to the surface of the tissue culture plates ; the others formed many small spheres of floating cells after day  <dig> of induction. msc-derived npcs proliferated for 1 week without changing morphology or phenotype. immunofluorescence staining showed that npcs derived from group b  were strongly positive for nestin  and sox- <dig> . moreover, data from flow cytometry confirmed the findings of immunocytochemical analysis  and it also confirmed the expression of nestin by npcs derived from all groups. in the  <dig>  events acquired,  <dig> % of the cells in group b under igf- <dig> treatment expressed nestin, whereas  <dig> % of the cells in group e expressed nestin and this expression might be due to the effect from neurobasal media. these results indicate the level of nestin-positive cells under the effect of the growth factors.figure  <dig>

proliferation assays
to elucidate the effects of growth factors on proliferation of npcs we investigated the growth of cells using mts assays at different time intervals  during the differentiation. our results showed that the treatment group with igf- <dig> had a significantly enhanced proliferation of npcs at each time interval . to validate these data, we performed a one-way anova across the groups. this demonstrated that igf- <dig> could maintain cell proliferation at all time points . our results were consistent with the previous study by supeno et al.  <cit> , which found that igf- <dig> enhanced the proliferation of neural stem cells. we also carried out multiple comparisons between the groups . these comparisons clearly showed the effects of other growth factors in maintaining cell proliferation and their significance in differentiation activity. however, igf- <dig> enhanced proliferation in npcs more than the other growth factors.figure  <dig>

apoptosis assay
to understand the role of the combination of growth factors on the survival of npcs in vitro, we also studied the apoptotic activity of npcs at three time intervals  using the annexin v kit. immunofluorescence staining of npcs revealed that the differentiation process induces cellular apoptosis . apoptotic activities such as necrosis and early and late apoptosis were quantified by flow cytometry. the group treated with igf- <dig> maintained the highest percentage of live cells at day  <dig> post induction,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . only  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  of cells in group b underwent necrosis at day  <dig>  day  <dig> and day  <dig> respectively . furthermore, only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of cells in group b underwent early apoptosis. the number increases to  <dig>  ± 15% on day  <dig> and decreases to 13 ±  <dig> % on day  <dig> . a total of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of cells from group b underwent late apoptosis, decreasing to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % on day  <dig> and further decreasing to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % on day  <dig> . taken together, the early and late apoptosis graphs suggest that the group treated with igf- <dig> has better survival efficiency than the rest of the groups.figure  <dig>

quantitative rt-pcr
total rnas were collected from each treatment group 3 days post induction, and real-time pcr validations on neurofilament gene  and nestin  were performed . pcr reactions were normalised by amplifying the same sample of cdna with primers against beta-actin . as expected, the treatment group with igf- <dig>  expressed the highest level of nestin , which was significantly greater than the other groups. however, the expression of the neurofilament gene did not show any significant variation in any of the treated groups. our results suggest that igf- <dig> maintains npcs in an undifferentiated state while sustaining the stemness.figure  <dig>

terminal differentiation of npcs
to assess the capability of npcs to differentiate into mature neuronal cell types in vitro, we used the protocol suggested by hermann et al.  <cit>  with minor modifications. npcs from groups a, b, c and d were plated in medium without egf and bfgf but with brain-derived neurotrophic factor  and platelet-derived growth factor . all the npcs in the four groups differentiated into mature neurons and glial cells. cells attached and changed their morphology on the following day . the cells from negative control, group e, were also treated similarly but the cells at the end did not attach indicating no mature neural cells were formed . the neural cells types formed most efficiently from the group b npcs compared to other groups . these differentiated cells, from group b npcs, were further characterized with specific markers. the cells were allowed to differentiate for 10 days with constant replacement of growth factors. differentiated cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% pfa in pbs, blocked, and stained with fluoropan neuronal marker and glial fibrillary acidic protein . we find it interesting that terminally differentiated npcs expressed the marker specific for neuronal protein  which commonly express in matured neuronal bodies and also gfap , an astrocytes marker. moreover, differentiated cells also showed the characteristics of mature neuronal and glial cells. thus our results have proved that npcs are capable of being differentiated into neurons and astrocytes by specific cytokines supplementation. the results clearly indicate the npcs derived from the group b were able to differentiate into mature neuronal phenotype.figure  <dig>

discussion
adult stem cells, particularly mesenchymal stem cells, have been used in neuro-regenerative medicine for the treatment of diseases such as stroke and traumatic brain injury  <cit> . the potential application of mscs from bench to bedside is due to their easy accessibility and expansion capability both in vivo and in vitro, and also their ability to promote endogenous neurogenesis via a variety of secretion factors. autologous transplantation of mscs extracted from wharton’s jelly has been reported to be free from immunogenic rejection  <cit> . it has been reported that mscs can be induced into neural lineage through several methods such as incubation with cytokines  <cit> , co-culture with nerve cells  <cit> , and transfection with known factors  <cit> . recent evidence has shown that synergistic treatment of mscs with bfgf and egf significantly differentiates mscs into cells expressing neural lineage markers. previous studies in the laboratory have shown that addition of igf- <dig> leads to enhanced embryonic striatal neural stem cell proliferation in vitro  <cit> . in the present study, we have demonstrated that the presence of igf- <dig> enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis during the differentiation of mscs into npcs.

nestin, the intermediate filament protein, is predominantly expressed during early neurogenesis and also expressed in neural stem cells  <cit> . immunofluorescence staining of mscs showed mild expression of nestin  consistent with the previous finding of wislet-gendebien et al.  <cit>  that nestin-positive mscs may differentiate in vitro into functional neuronal-like cells. from recent studies it can be suggested that mscs have two populations: nestin positive and nestin negative  <cit> . some research suggests that the mscs express the nestin when they are under stress  <cit> . however, further research is warranted to characterise the two populations of the mscs and trace their origins. in our study, neurosphere formation was observed in all groups except group e, and the size of the neurospheres increased every day , indicating that cell proliferation occurs during the differentiation. the phenotype and morphology of msc-derived neurospheres in our study are similar to that of embryonic striatal stem cells isolated previously in the laboratory  <cit> . during the differentiation, nestin expression increases sharply , and immunochemical staining showed that almost all the cells were positive for nestin and sox- <dig> after 5 days. this indicated that the mscs have switched from their original mesodermal lineage into ectodermal and started differentiate into more lineage specific cells such as neurons or astrocytes. flow cytometry analysis of group e  clearly showed that without growth factors a few mscs were differentiated into npcs. this differentiation may be due to either the effect of neural basal media or in vitro stress. the nestin expression was highest in the npcs derived from igf- <dig>  indicating that the growth factor enhances the proliferation of npcs during the differentiation of mscs into npcs. we investigated the proliferation activity of each group due to the effect of the respective growth factors. our result strongly corroborated with the previous finding that igf- <dig> treatment could significantly enhance proliferation of npcs in vitro . since our aim was to study the early stages of neuronal differentiation, a proliferation assay was carried out in a stage-specific approach on passage  <dig> at five different time intervals. we hypothesized that the cells would undergo apoptosis at day  <dig> and start to stabilise at day  <dig> post-induction. this is consistent with the previous finding that one third of mscs died after induction  <cit> . igf- <dig> has mitogenic effects by promoting g1/s cell cycle progression through akt-dependent and tyrosine kinase–signalling pathways . these signalling pathways activate cell cycles and anti-apoptotic pathways; hence npcs formed will proliferate efficiently in the presence of igf- <dig>  <cit> . we also carried out intergroup comparisons, and the data was presented in checkbox format . our data has clearly indicated that igf- <dig> has positive regulatory effects in maintaining cellular propagation of npcs in neuronal differentiation.

mscs may even release certain neurotrophic factors such as bdnf, nerve growth factor, and glial-derived neurotrophic factors  <cit> , and it is well known that the neurotrophic factors are important for maintaining cellular survival of neuronal cells both in vitro and in vivo. immunochemistry showed that neurospheres from all groups undergo qualitatively similar apoptosis . therefore, we proceeded to quantitative analysis using flow cytometry, and the data were presented in four different graphs, which indicated the percentages of live cells, necrotic cells, and early and late apoptotic cells . cells treated with igf- <dig> showed generally better cell survival, maintaining a higher percentage of live cells and a lower percentage of both necrotic and apoptotic cells during differentiation. moreover, our results also suggested that since mscs could self-secrete bdnf, which is crucial for neuroprotection, and our findings show that igf- <dig> promotes better survivability than those induced under bdnf influence alone . we suggest that igf- <dig> might interact with bdnf to promote better enhancement of terminal differentiation.

results of both proliferation and apoptosis have led us to conclude that npcs achieve optimal condition 3 days post induction. thus we investigated the quantity of nestin and neurofilament genes expressed at day  <dig> from all groups. our results showed that the group treated with igf- <dig> expressed the highest nestin level of all groups. this indicated that igf- <dig> effectively maintains the stemness of the neural progenitor cells and the combination of the growth factors maintains the cells in an undifferentiated stage; our findings support those in the previous study by chang et al.  <cit> .

furthermore, we successfully differentiated neurospheres from all groups into cells that expressed neuronal markers and astrocytes . thus, our neurospheres induced from mscs are self-proliferating cells that maintain the capacity to differentiate into mature brain cells.

we differentiated neurospheres from each group according to hermann et al.  <cit> . neurospheres from all groups terminally differentiated into cells with a neuronal phenotype. the neural phenotype  formed from neurospheres treated with igf- <dig> are shown in the figure  <dig>  the terminal differentiation of neurospheres in the group b was most efficient compared to other three groups. thus our results showed clearly that the combination of growth factors egf + fgf-2 + igf- <dig> enhances proliferation and reduces the apoptosis in the npcs during the differentiation of mscs into neural lineages. the igf- <dig> treatment produced healthier and more functional neural progenitor-like cells compared to other combinations of growth factors tested.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that igf- <dig> is an important growth factor for enhancing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of neural progenitor-like cells during differentiation of mscs into neural lineages. further, igf- <dig> enhances nestin expression. these enhancements might be due to the activation of tyrosine kinase– and pi <dig> kinase–signalling pathways, which are mediated by the igf- <dig> growth factor . these pathways activate proliferation and inhibit apoptosis in the npcs. this information will be beneficial for future improvements in both cell-based and cell-free therapy for neurodegenerative diseases.
