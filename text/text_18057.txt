BACKGROUND
fungiculture in the insect world is practised by ants, termites, beetles and gall midges  <cit> . the best-characterized examples are the attine ants, which are endemic to south and central america and to the southern usa. the ancestor of these ants evolved the ability to cultivate fungus as a food source around  <dig> million years ago, leading to the monophyletic tribe attini, which number  <dig> genera with more than  <dig> species. the genera acromyrmex and atta  evolved 8- <dig> million years ago and form a branch of the higher attines, also known as leaf-cutting ants, which are characterized by large colonies of up to several million individuals  <cit> . like the other leaf-cutting ants, the well-studied species acromyrmex octospinosus forms a mutualism with a single basidiomycete fungus  leucoagaricus gongylophorus in which they exchange food as well as protection and transport services  <cit> .

the mutualistic fungal garden can be parasitized by a variety of other fungi  <cit>  but the major pathogen of leaf-cutting ant fungal gardens is a necrotrophic fungus  in the genus escovopsis  <cit> . around 25% of the gardens in panamanian ant colonies contain escovopsis which feed on the fungal cultivar and can destroy fungal gardens, leading to the collapse of the colony  <cit> .

there is evidence that the fungal cultivar produces antibiotics in order to defend itself  <cit>  and the ant workers also defend their fungal gardens through a combination of grooming and weeding  <cit> , production of their own antimicrobials through metapleural gland secretions  <cit>  and the application of weedkillers. these weedkillers are natural product antimicrobials produced by symbiotic actinomycete bacteria  <cit> . a long-standing theory suggests that bacteria from the genus pseudonocardia co-evolved with the ants and are transmitted vertically by the gynes  along with the fungal cultivar. however, more recently, evidence has emerged that suggests attine ants are also associated with bacteria from the actinomycete genera streptomyces and amycolatopsis and that antibiotic-producing actinomycetes can be horizontally acquired through male dispersal and sampling of actinomycetes from the soil  <cit> .

the identities of the antifungals produced by attine ant-associated actinomycetes remain largely unknown. only two compounds have been identified so far: a previously unknown antifungal named dentigerumycin that is produced by pseudonocardia species isolated from the lower attines apterostigma dentigerum and candicidin, a well known antifungal that is produced by streptomyces species isolated from the higher attine ants belonging to the genus acromyrmex  <cit> . pseudonocardia isolated from a. octospinosus also inhibit the growth of escovopsis in bioassays, but the antifungal compounds have not been isolated or identified  <cit> .

the aims of this work were to isolate and identify actinomycete bacteria from a. octospinosus, identify antifungal compounds produced by these bacteria and thereby gain insights into whether the actinomycetes  co-evolved with the ants, as suggested by unusual antifungal compounds produced by pseudonocardia mutualists, or  were acquired from the environment, as suggested by the presence of well known antifungals that are widely produced by environmental isolates. we isolated actinomycetes from three colonies of a. octospinosus that were collected in trinidad, identified two pseudonocardia and nine streptomyces species and chose single antifungal producing pseudonocardia and streptomyces species isolated from the same ant colony for further analysis. the streptomyces species was found to produce candicidin and is closely related to the candicidin-producing streptomyces bacteria isolated from a. octospinosus in panama  <cit> , supporting the hypothesis that candicidin-producing streptomyces species are common mutualists of higher attines and are probably acquired via environmental sampling. the pseudonocardia species produces an unusual antifungal compound that is related to the clinically important polyene antifungal nystatin. the isolation of these species suggests that the diversity of actinomycetes associated with attine ants probably occurs through both co-evolution of pseudonocardia with the ants and environmental sampling.

this work also takes the total number of known antifungals associated with attine ants to three, two of which are associated with a. octospinosus, and provides the first direct biochemical evidence that a diversity of actinomycete symbionts translates into a diversity of antifungal compounds in attine ant colonies.

RESULTS
isolation and bioassay of actinomycetes
a. octospinosus ants from three colonies collected in trinidad were either streaked directly onto hc and ms agar plates or washed in sterile water which was then spread onto the agar. actinomycete colonies were purified by restreaking and then examined by light microscopy and identified by  <dig> s rdna sequencing. together with bacteria from other genera  two pseudonocardia  and nine streptomyces  strains were isolated and identified . all bacterial strains were screened in bioassays against a strain of escovopsis weberi isolated from an a. octospinosus nest and against candida albicans, a human pathogen. bioassays revealed that strains p <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> inhibit the growth of e. weberi when grown on ms agar  while p <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> also inhibit the growth of c. albicans . the pseudonocardia p <dig> strain has weak activity against e. weberi and very weak activity against c. albicans .

streptomyces s <dig> makes candicidin
a previous study revealed that a streptomyces strain isolated from a. octospinosus in panama makes the polyene antifungal candicidin  <cit>  and a polymerase chain reaction  analysis of the nine streptomyces and two pseudonocardia strains using primers used by haeder et al. in their study revealed that only streptomyces s <dig> and s <dig> contain the candicidin biosynthesis genes fscm and fscp . candicidin production was confirmed using liquid chromatography  followed by tandem mass spectrometry  on butanol-extracted culture supernatants of streptomyces s <dig> . the fscm and fscp genes were not found in p <dig>  s <dig>  or s <dig>  which suggests that they are producing antifungals not previously identified in the a. octospinosus mutualism. the pcr product amplified using fscp primers in the s <dig> sample was sequenced and is not fscp, consistent with its slightly larger size .

genome scanning of pseudonocardia p1
pseudonocardia p <dig>  isolated from the same ant colony as streptomyces s <dig>  produces a relatively small zone of inhibition in bioassays against e. weberi and a very small zone of inhibition against c. albicans . furthermore, the antifungal activity of pseudonocardia p <dig> was only detected on solid growth medium. this combination of factors made it difficult to purify sufficient antifungal compound for analysis and identification. in order to gain further insight into the antifungal produced by pseudonocardia p <dig>  we used 454-pyrosequencing to scan the genome of strain p <dig> . analysis of the annotated contigs from this sequencing project revealed several polyketide synthase  gene fragments with > 90% amino acid identity to proteins involved in the biosynthesis of an antifungal compound named nystatin-like pseudonocardia polyene  that is produced by pseudonocardia autotrophica  <cit> . npp is related to nystatin, a polyene antifungal that is made by streptomyces noursei  <cit> .

in order to determine whether or not pseudonocardia p <dig> contains the entire biosynthetic gene cluster for a nystatin-like compound, contigs were aligned against the characterized npp biosynthetic gene cluster from p. autotrophica . the tiled contigs spanned the entire cluster, including the six pks genes that assemble the nystatin aglycone, the non-sugar containing backbone of nystatin. full-length coding sequences were captured for  <dig> genes  that are proposed to be primarily involved in the post pks-modification of the nystatin aglycone and two new genes, nypy and nypz, with unknown functions   <cit> . interestingly, a second glycosyltransferase, absent in s. noursei and p. autotrophica, is present in the nyp gene cluster and we have named it nypy . the nypy protein belongs to the same glycosyltransferase family as nypdi, however it displays only 42% amino acid identity to nypdi and is therefore unlikely to be a functionally redundant copy of nypdi. this genome analysis strongly suggested that pseudonocardia p <dig> has the genetic capacity to produce a nystatin-like polyene antifungal. pcr screening of the pseudonocardia p <dig> strain and the nine streptomyces strains isolated in this study suggests that none of them contain biosynthetic genes for a nystatin-like antifungal .

† nypy is a glycosyltransferase unique to the nystatin p <dig> biosynthetic gene cluster and is not orthologous to proteins in the nystatin-like pseudonocardia polyene  biosynthetic gene cluster from p. autotrophica  or the nystatin biosynthetic gene cluster from streptomyces nouresi .

‡ the nystatin p <dig> and npp biosynthetic gene clusters contain a putative metallophosphoesterase downstream of nyph and npph, respectively that is not present in the nystatin biosynthetic gene cluster from s. nouresi. this open reading frame was not originally annotated by kim et al.  <cit>  and we have therefore given the pseudonocardia p <dig> ortholog the name of nypz.

§ nypm encodes a hypothetical protein with high homology to nppm, which is annotated as a putative ferredoxin  <cit> , however amino acid homology-based database searches failed to reveal homology to ferredoxin proteins.

identification of a nystatin-like compound in pseudonocardia p1
in order to determine whether pseudonocardia p <dig> produces a nystatin-like antifungal compound, extracts of pseudonocardia p <dig> were analysed by lc-ms/ms and compared to a nystatin a <dig> standard . molecular ions for nystatin a <dig>  or for npp , produced by p. autotrophica  <cit>  were not detected. however, a compound with a similar retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography  to nystatin a <dig> and with a molecular ion of m/z  <dig>  was identified . this compound clearly, though somewhat concealed by the absorption of co-eluting peaks, shows the characteristic polyene absorption bands in its ultraviolet spectrum . together with the presence of nystatin-like biosynthetic genes in pseudonocardia p <dig>  the lc-ms/ms results strongly suggested that the p1-derived extract contained a nystatin-like compound. we have tentatively named this compound nystatin p <dig> 

the mass difference of  <dig> observed between nystatin p <dig> and nystatin a <dig> suggested that nystatin p <dig> contains an additional hexose molecule. ms/ms fragmentation of the nystatin p <dig> ion  resulted in a series of product ions that are very similar to those derived from nystatin a <dig> . all of the fragment ions corresponding to the nystatin p <dig> aglycone have corresponding counterparts in the nystatin a <dig> standard . these data strongly suggested that the aglycone  of nystatin a <dig> and nystatin p <dig> is the same. interestingly, the product ion with m/z  <dig> is consistent with a mycosamine-hexose disaccharide and was only observed for nystatin p <dig>  further fragmentation of the m/z  <dig> ion species corroborated the disaccharide nature of this moiety .

the exact identity of the sugar molecules is, of course, speculative. mycosamine is a probable component of nystatin p <dig> because this aminosugar is found in nystatin a <dig> and all the necessary genes for its biosynthesis and attachment to the aglycone have been identified in pseudonocardia p <dig> . glucose is frequently found as a substituent in bacterial natural products. however, other natural hexoses such as mannose or galactose are also good candidates for the second sugar substituent. the attachment of the hexose to give nystatin p <dig> is most likely to be executed by the glycosyltransferase nypy . the presence of the disaccharide in ms/ms furthermore suggested that the nystatin p <dig> aglycone is substituted at one position with a mycosamine-hexose moiety rather than the two sugar molecules being attached at separate positions.

discussion
we isolated actinomycetes from a. octospinosus garden worker ants and, in a single colony of ants, identified a pseudonocardia and a streptomyces species that produce antifungals in laboratory culture. the streptomyces species, which we named s <dig>  contains candicidin biosynthesis genes  and produces candicidin , consistent with a report on antifungal-producing actinomycetes associated with a. octospinosus  <cit> . the actinomycetes studied in this work were isolated from a. octospinosus ants collected in trinidad, whereas the previous study used a. octospinosus ants collected in panama  <cit> . however, despite this geographic separation, the candicidin-producing streptomyces strains identified in the two studies show 99%  <dig> s rdna sequence identity suggesting that candicidin-producing streptomyces are common mutualists of a. octospinosus. candicidin-producing streptomyces are widespread in the environment  <cit>  and attine ants most likely acquire them selectively from the soil.

the pseudonocardia species p <dig>  isolated from the same colony as streptomyces s <dig>  showed relatively weak antifungal activity that was only observed in cultures grown on solid growth medium. this made it difficult to purify enough of the compound for analysis and identification. using a genome scanning approach we identified a biosynthetic gene cluster for a polyene antifungal in pseudonocardia p <dig> and then isolated and identified this antifungal using lc-ms/ms. this combined chemical and genomic approach provides a powerful tool for identifying and isolating new antibiotics and confirmed that pseudonocardia p <dig> produces a polyene antifungal that we have tentatively named nystatin p <dig>  this compound is markedly different from the antifungal dentigerumycin produced by pseudonocardia associated with the lower attine ant species a. dentigerum  <cit>  although it is notable that both pseudonocardia strains are making previously unknown antifungals, consistent with the idea that the pseudonocardia mutualists co-evolved with attine ants. we did not detect any compounds in extracts from pseudonocardia p <dig> agar plates and mycelium that matched the isotopic mass of dentigerumycin. however, since the biosynthetic gene cluster for this compound is not known, we cannot exclude the possibility that this strain also has the ability to make dentigerumycin.

taken together, this work provides the first direct evidence that individual leaf-cutting ant colonies have access to multiple antifungals via the diversity of hosted actinomycetes and increases the number of known antifungals used by attine ants to three. this work also provides evidence to support the two current possibilities for the identity and acquisition of mutualistic bacteria, pseudonocardia co-evolution, and the environmental acquisition of useful actinomycetes. this strongly suggests that both possibilities apply, at least in the attine species a. octospinosus. careful experimental work will be needed in order to demonstrate that multiple compounds are in fact produced and confer benefits in vivo  <cit> . it is interesting that the only two antifungal compounds to be isolated and identified from a. octospinosus colonies so far are polyenes, which are active against dimorphic fungi, yeasts  and molds , but which apparently do not kill the fungal cultivar  <cit> . the isolation of a nystatin-like polyene from a leaf-cutting ant-associated pseudonocardia species in this work agrees with the report by sen et al.  <cit>  that some pseudonocardia bacteria associated with attine ants have non-specific antibiotic properties that inhibit a range of fungi and are not targeted specifically at escovopsis  <cit> .

the advantage to the ants of deploying two antifungals is not clear. polyene antifungals are thought to work by interacting hydrophobically with ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane and forming channels that increase membrane permeability  <cit> , but this may not be their only mechanism of action  <cit> , and there may therefore be some advantage to the ants in using more than one. however, as fungi do not develop resistance to polyene antifungals , it is unlikely that resistance is the basis for any such advantage. nevertheless, as candicidin and nystatin are not antibacterial, neither of these compounds is likely to be involved in competition amongst the bacteria for host resources. thus, the identities of these two antifungal compounds are consistent with the longstanding hypothesis that these actinomycete associates of leaf-cutting ants can be mutualists of the ant and the attine fungus, provided that the compounds are applied correctly by the ant  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we used a combined genomic and chemical approach that has proven useful for the identification of a new antifungal associated with acromyrmex ants, this time produced by their pseudonocardia mutualist. this approach should stimulate further chemical ecology studies of insect fungiculture systems, which are widespread in nature and which are likely to use symbiotic antibiotic-producing bacteria to protect their fungal partners  <cit> . we also provide evidence that supports both of the possibilities proposed to explain the mutualism between actinomycetes and attine ants-co-evolution of pseudonocardia with attine ants and environmental sampling by the ants of useful antibiotic-producing bacteria. we propose that these possibilities are not mutually exclusive and that both are likely to apply to both attine ants and other systems of insect fungiculture.
