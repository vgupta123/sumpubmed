BACKGROUND
the role of the immune system in spinal cord injury  is complex, controversial, and relevant to the pathophysiology and treatment of sci. the literature supports both positive and negative effects of the immune system in functional recovery after sci  <cit> . t cells, which help coordinate the immune response, have received substantial attention for their role in sci.

systemic spread of central nervous system  antigens after sci leads to the formation of autoimmune t cells  <cit>  that migrate to the injury site, reaching peak accumulation at 1 week post-injury  <cit> . helper t cells are responsible for macrophage recruitment and activation, which has been shown to produce focal axonal injury and demyelination  <cit> . these cells also cause formation of autoimmune b cells that produce antibodies to cns proteins  <cit> . meanwhile, autoimmune cytotoxic t cells have been demonstrated to produce significant white matter pathology  <cit> . interestingly, while myelin-reactive t cells are associated with tissue loss and functional impairment  <cit> , these same cells have been found to secrete neuroprotective factors and prevent secondary damage to the spinal cord via “protective autoimmunity” .

t cell suppression appears to improve recovery from sci. t cell inhibitors including cyclosporine  <cit> , fingolimod  <cit> , and integrin inhibitors  <cit>  have been shown to improve neurological function after sci, though their benefit may depend upon injury severity  <cit> . t cell-deficient athymic nude  rats demonstrate superior locomotor function after transection injury compared to immunocompetent sprague–dawley  rats  <cit> . the effects of t cell deficiency in nervous system trauma are not limited to sci; t and b cell-deficient rag1−/− mice suffer less damage from traumatic brain injury  <cit> .

in order to characterize the whole-genome response to sci, researchers have employed microarrays  <cit>  and rna sequencing   <cit> . gene transcripts associated with inflammation, cell death and survival, tissue and vascular repair, and nervous system function and development are most highly represented in the injury epicenter . the only study to examine gene expression differences between an and sd rats  <cit>  employed microarray analysis—a more limited technique than rna-seq—and found only  <dig> genes that differed between the two strains.

in the present study, we assessed  locomotor recovery and  gene expression in the injury epicenter, following sci, in both sd and an rats. we focused on the acute  and chronic  phases of recovery. based on previously findings after spinal cord transection, we hypothesized that an rats would show sustained superior locomotor function after injury compared to sd rats. we subsequently used rna-seq to identify gene expression differences between the two strains that could explain variation in locomotor function.

methods
spinal cord injury and postoperative care
all studies were approved by the university of minnesota institutional animal care and use committee . age-matched adult  female sd  and an  rats  received moderate contusion injury using the infinite horizon impactor . briefly, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and underwent t8/t <dig> laminectomy followed by spinal cord impact at a force of  <dig> kdyn. animals received buprenorphine  for 3 days after surgery to moderate acute pain, and amoxicillin  for 7 days after surgery to prevent urinary tract infection as part of standard postoperative care. urine was expressed manually twice daily for the first 3 days after surgery and daily thereafter until the return of independent urination. animals were assigned to either the acute  or chronic  recovery phase groups.

functional assessment
locomotion was assessed by two observers using the basso, beattie, and bresnahan  scale  <cit>  on the second postoperative day and at the end of each week following surgery. animals were on site for at least 1 week prior to sci to acclimate to the environment and handling by the observers. raters were trained by a researcher  with extensive experience using the bbb scale. bbb scores were compared between strains via repeated-measures analysis of variance.

tissue preparation
at  <dig> or 8 weeks after injury, animals were anesthetized with ketamine  and xylazine . for rna-seq analysis, animals underwent transcardial perfusion with phosphate buffered saline , and a 1-mm spinal cord segment through the injury site was harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. for histological analysis, animals underwent transcardial perfusion with 4 % paraformaldehyde. the spinal cord was removed and cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose.

histology
spinal cord segments from some animals sacrificed 1 week post-injury  were frozen in oct compound and sectioned in the parasagittal plane at a thickness of 10 μm. representative sections for each spinal cord were selected from the mid-sagittal area and immunostained. the following antibodies were used: anti-cd <dig>  for macrophages, anti-cd <dig>  for m <dig> macrophages, anti-cd <dig>  for m <dig> macrophages, donkey anti-rabbit igg , and donkey anti-mouse igg . negative controls were obtained by omission of the primary antibody. immunofluorescent photomicrographs were taken from a 1-mm segment centered on the lesion epicenter.

immunofluorescence images were analyzed using imagej . threshold values for excluding background fluorescence were determined as the 95th percentile of pixel intensity averaged across all negative control images for each immunostain. the analyze particle function was then used to determine the percent of tissue area stained. percent area was compared between an and sd groups via the two-tailed student’s t test using an alpha value of  <dig> .

rna extraction and sequencing
rna extraction, cdna library creation, and rna-seq were performed with the assistance of the university of minnesota biomedical genomics center staff. rna was extracted from tissue samples using the rneasy mini kit . rna quantity and quality were assessed with the aligent  <dig> bioanalyzer . the polyadenylated coding mrna in each extract  was isolated and reverse transcribed using random primers. the resulting paired-end cdna libraries were subsequently sequenced using the hiseq  <dig> . for each sample, at least  <dig> million paired-end reads of  <dig> base pairs were performed.

read mapping and transcript identification
analysis of rna-seq data was carried out using the galaxy software platform  hosted by the minnesota supercomputing institute. reads first underwent quality control assessment with the fastqc tool and adapter sequence contamination removal with the cutadapt tool. because all base positions had first-quartile phred scores greater than  <dig>  trimming with fastq trimmer was not needed. reads were subsequently mapped to the rattus norvegicus rn <dig> reference genome with tophat   <cit>  using an empirically determined insertion size of  <dig> base pairs. the mapped reads were assembled into transcripts with cufflinks   <cit>  using quartile normalization. transcriptional datasets for each time point were pooled using cuffmerge, and differences between strains at each time point were identified with cuffdiff. gene expression differences with a q value  less than  <dig>  were considered to be statistically significant.

immune and neural marker genes
to measure the presence and activity of both immune and neural cells, we first identified a variety of genetic markers for different cell types belonging to the innate immune system, adaptive immune system, and cns as follows: dendritic cell , macrophage , m <dig> macrophage , m <dig> macrophage , mast cell , granulocyte , nk cell , t cell , helper t cell , th <dig> cell , th <dig> cell , cytotoxic t cell , b cell , neuron , oligodendrocyte , and astrocyte . for each cell type, the marker with the greatest abundance  summed over the four conditions  was used as the final cell marker.

broad patterns of differential gene expression
in order to broadly understand strain-dependent differences in biological processes in response to injury, we categorized a subgroup of genes using gene set enrichment analysis . specifically, genes differentially expressed between strains in the acute phase only were examined via gsea. first, rat genome database  gene identifiers were converted to gene symbols using the david gene id conversion tool . gene symbols for differentially expressed genes were then entered into the gsea utility  and mapped to the canonical pathways gene set collection. the  <dig> most highly enriched gene sets were identified.

investigation of specific pathophysiological processes
to investigate differences in specific processes  between strains, we identified appropriate gene ontology  terms related to those processes . along with these go terms, we entered genes differentially expressed in the acute and/or chronic phases into the amigo slimmer tool . this allowed us to compare gene expression in processes of interest between strains at different time points.

RESULTS
locomotor recovery
a total of  <dig> an and  <dig> sd rats underwent contusive sci at a force of  <dig> kdyn. the bbb locomotor scores of an and sd rats differed  at 1 week following injury, at which point the mean bbb scores  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively . the bbb scores of the two strains did not differ at any other time point.fig.  <dig> variation in locomotor recovery between an and sd rats. a mean bbb locomotor score over time following sci. asterisk indicates p <  <dig> . n =  <dig> for an rats; n =  <dig> for sd rats. error bars represent ± <dig> standard error. b locomotor difference and t cell infiltration. mean bbb score difference between an and sd rats  and t cell density  in injury epicenter of sd rat . t cell data is used with permission  <cit> . error bars represent ± <dig> standard error



figure 1b shows the time course of the difference between bbb scores of an and sd rats as well as the density of the t cell infiltrate in the sd rat injury epicenter   <cit>  over the first 4 weeks after injury. the locomotor advantage of an rats over sd rats at 1 week coincides with the maximal t cell infiltrate, and both functional difference and t cell density decrease gradually thereafter.

rna-seq experimental design
based upon the locomotor difference between an and sd rats in the acute  but not chronic  phase of recovery, we took a multi-step approach to analysis of rna-seq data. first, to gain a broad understanding of the transcriptional basis of the acute locomotor difference, we compared the acute- and chronic-phase differential expression profiles to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the acute phase only. we then identified physiological pathways that were highly represented among these genes. second, to investigate specific pathophysiological processes involved in sci, we identified genes that were differentially expressed—in the acute and/or chronic phase—and associated with select go terms.

most genes belonging to immune system gene sets were greater expressed in an rats , with the exception of cell adhesion molecules . examination of genes belonging to the “immune system” gene set revealed that genes for cytokines il-1a  and il- <dig>  were among the most an-enriched immune system-related genes in the acute phase. genes belonging to neurons and axon gene sets were greater expressed in sd rats . genes belonging to gpcr signaling and cell transport gene sets were more frequently enriched in sd rats . the “other” theme consisted of the “cell cycle” and “developmental biology” gene sets. cell cycle genes were nearly all enriched in an rats , while developmental biology genes were predominantly enriched in sd rats .

cell death-associated genes
we identified cell death-associated genes differentially expressed in the acute and/or chronic phases . genes associated with the cell death parent go term were acutely enriched in sd rats  and chronically enriched in an rats . programmed cell death  was more highly represented than necrotic cell death . of note, however, necrosis-associated genes were enriched in an rats in both the acute  and chronic  phases. genes associated with regulation of cell death were acutely enriched in sd rats  and chronically enriched in an rats . neuron death-associated genes were enriched in sd rats in both acute  and chronic  phases, though less so in the chronic phase. for cell and neuron death at a given time point, the strain with greater expression of death-associated genes also had greater expression of both positive and negative death regulation-associated genes. table  <dig> differential expression within gene ontologies of interest

voltage-gated potassium channel-related genes
we identified differentially expressed genes associated with voltage-gated potassium  channels . genes related to kv channel activity were enriched in sd rats in both the acute  and chronic  phases. similarly, genes related to the kv channel complex were enriched in sd rats in both the acute  and chronic  phases. one gene  related to kv channel clustering was differentially expressed. cntn <dig> was differentially expressed in the acute phase  but not in the chronic phase .

discussion
in this study, we found that t cell-deficient an rats possess greater locomotor function than immunocompetent sd rats at 1 week post-sci, but not at other time points. we examined differential gene expression between an and sd rats using rna-seq to clarify the physiological and cellular basis for this functional difference. a prior study of gene expression in an and sd rats after sci found only  <dig> genes whose expression differed by strain  <cit> . in contrast, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the acute  and/or chronic  phases of sci. the only published report of functional recovery after sci in an and sd rats found sustained locomotor advantage in an rats following spinal cord transection  <cit> . we too observed functional superiority in an rats after contusion sci; however, this advantage was only seen at 1 week post-injury.

effect of t cell deficiency on locomotor recovery
athymic nude rats have previously been found to achieve greater locomotor function than sd rats after spinal cord transection  <cit> . whereas sd rats only recovered slight movement of hindlimb joints, an rats on average regained extensive movement in one or more hindlimb joints. based upon this finding, we initially hypothesized that an rats would demonstrate superior locomotor function over the entire recovery period following moderate spinal cord contusion. in our study, an rats achieved greater bbb locomotor scores  than sd rats  at 1 week post-injury, with weight-supported stepping observed in some an rats but no sd rats. however, this functional advantage was transient. the bbb score difference followed a similar time course to the magnitude of the t cell infiltration in immunocompetent sd rats  <cit> . also in line with difference in functional outcome, greater magnitude of differential gene expression was observed in the acute phase of recovery than in the chronic phase.

discrepancy between our results and those of the aforementioned study are likely due to substantial differences in the mechanism and severity of injury. the authors of the prior study conceded that axonal regrowth through the transection site was implausible and attributed prolonged functional difference to sparing of local neuronal connections and central pattern generators  <cit> . in contusion injury, longitudinal white matter tracts are partially spared  <cit>  and undergo some long-distance regeneration in addition to local sprouting  <cit> . variation in the extent and function of surviving tissue may help to account for the difference in locomotor recovery between an and sd rats.

mechanistic basis of altered locomotor recovery
the pathophysiology of sci is complex, and the processes of secondary injury, wound healing, and functional recovery are multifactorial  <cit> . consequently, comprehensive analysis of these processes is difficult, despite the use of broad-spectrum techniques such as rna-seq. we have therefore focused on specific, known pathophysiological aspects of sci that may plausibly be related to t cell function.

the differential recovery course between sd and an rats in this study has two possible explanations which are not mutually exclusive. one hypothesis is that while an rats recover function more quickly after sci, they are limited in their ultimate recovery in the same ways as sd rats. for example, while the absence of t cells may contribute to tissue sparing in the acute phase of sci, that tissue may be gradually lost nonetheless. a second hypothesis is that an rats are less vulnerable to temporary causes of paralysis after sci, but functional differences disappear once those effects have subsided. these causes may include edema, metabolic dysfunction, and kv channel dysregulation  <cit> .

in our analysis, we compared components of the immune response between an and sd rats. we then investigated strain-dependent differences in cell death, tissue repair, and kv channel function. observed trends in gene expression were consistent with involvement of all of these processes in differential recovery from sci. we propose a model in which t cells contribute to early tissue damage, demyelination, and kv channel dysregulation in sd rats following contusion sci, but delayed tissue death limits the long-term recovery of an rats.

immune response to sci in an rats
the immune response differed substantially between an and sd rats. among genes differentially expressed in the acute phase only, immune system-related genes were most highly represented. as expected, t cell and helper t cell marker genes were greater expressed in sd rats in the acute phase, when the t cell response is maximal  <cit> . however, other t cell subsets appeared to be more numerous in an rats. cytotoxic t cell marker cd8a was enriched in an rats in the acute phase, while th <dig> cell marker cxcr <dig> was enriched in an rats in both acute and chronic phases. shift from th <dig> to th <dig> has been associated with anti-inflammatory processes  <cit> , so th <dig> enrichment in an rats may facilitate locomotion in the acute period.

the presence and functionality of t cells in an rats remains an open topic of research. the absence of a functional thymus leads to production of fewer, less mature “t-like cells”  <cit> . culture of t-like cells from an rats yields cytotoxic t cells that recognize foreign antigens in vitro but not in vivo  <cit> . t-like cells accumulate over time, reaching half of the normal t cell level by 8–12 months of age  <cit> . rats in the present study, however, were injured at 4 months of age.

elevated cd8a and cxcr <dig> expression in an rats conceivably might not reflect an overabundance of cytotoxic t cells and th <dig> cells. cd8a is also expressed on nk cells  <cit>  and cns-infiltrating macrophages  <cit> . however, while cd8a was acutely enriched in an rats, nk cell marker klra <dig> was enriched in an rats in the chronic phase only, and macrophage marker cd <dig> was not differentially expressed. cxcr <dig> is involved in cns development  <cit> , but development-related genes were predominantly enriched in sd rats. thus, increased cd8a and cxcr <dig> expression is consistent with greater cytotoxic t cell and th <dig> cell infiltration in an rats. the basis of these differences is unclear but may relate to complex t cell abnormalities in an rats.

highly enriched expression of macrophage-secreted cytokines il-1a and il- <dig> in an rats may reflect compensation for the deficient t cell response. nk cells, which are actually more numerous and effective in an rats compared to normal littermates  <cit> , appeared to be abundant in the chronic injury site of an rats and may similarly compensate for t cell deficiency. conversely, chronic enrichment of mast cells in an rats may have aided recovery, as mast cells have been found to reduce inflammation following sci  <cit> . the role of mast cells in cns injury is controversial, however, as mast cells have been reported to exacerbate brain injury in ischemic stroke  <cit>  and intracerebral hemorrhage  <cit> .

macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and b cells play important roles in sci  <cit> , but their respective marker genes did not vary between an and sd rats. macrophage recruitment and activation is driven by helper t cells, and prior research has found reduced macrophage infiltrate in an rats compared to sd rats at 11 weeks post-injury  <cit> . we therefore performed fluorescent immunostaining for macrophage  and macrophage subtype  markers in the acute injury phase   <cit> . we found no strain-dependent differences in the presence of any of these markers, consistent with our gene expression findings. it should be noted that histological differentiation of m <dig> and m <dig> macrophage subtypes is difficult  <cit>  and is often done using double-staining methods  <cit> , which were not feasible in our case owing to technical limitations.

cell death and tissue repair
our findings suggest that while sd rats appear to suffer greater acute neuronal death, delayed cell death was more common in an rats. in the acute phase, 61 % of cell death-associated genes and 79 % of neuron death-associated genes were enriched in sd rats; in the chronic phase, 57 % of cell death-associated genes were enriched in an rats. only 41 % of neuron death-associated genes were chronically enriched in an rats; this discrepancy suggests that delayed cell death in an rats may involve less loss of neurons than oligodendrocytes and other cells.

the predominant form of cell death appears to have been apoptosis rather than necrosis. of note, necrosis-associated genes were enriched in an rats, suggesting greater non-immune-mediated cell death. this is consistent with a past report of reduced apoptosis 24 h after traumatic brain injury in mice without functional t cells compared with immunocompetent mice  <cit> .

kv channel dysregulation
demyelination of intact axons uncovers kv channels located in the juxtaparanodal and internodal regions  <cit> . exposure of these channels leads to decreased axonal excitability and creates a conduction block  <cit> . this problem is compounded by increased kv expression  <cit>  and redistribution of kv channels along axons  <cit> .

conceivably, if t cell activity causes increased cell death and demyelination, kv channel dysregulation may contribute to the transient locomotor superiority of an rats after contusion sci. consistent with this hypothesis, we found that nearly all differentially expressed kv channel-related genes were enriched in sd rats in both the acute and chronic phases. notably, the kv channel clustering gene cntn <dig> was greater expressed in sd rats in the acute phase only. cntn <dig>  is necessary to confine kv channels to the juxtaparanodal region  <cit> . expression of cntn <dig> has been found to increase after sci, and cntn <dig> dysfunction is associated with worse motor recovery and decreased axonal regrowth following injury  <cit> . thus, increased expression of cntn <dig> and kv channel-related genes may occur in response to greater early demyelination in sd rats. delayed demyelination  in an rats may explain the absence of chronic differential expression of cntn <dig> 

other contributing factors
despite greater acute tissue damage, sd rats may have undergone greater axonal regrowth. neurofilament expression was strongly elevated in sd rats in the acute  and chronic  phases. axon guidance-related genes were highlighted in gsea and were highly enriched in sd rats. axon guidance refers to migration of the axon growth cone, and like increased neurofilament synthesis, enrichment of axon guidance-related genes suggests increased axonal repair in sd rats. axonal tracing studies are necessary to test this hypothesis. local sprouting and long-distance axonal regeneration are known to occur after contusion sci  <cit> . however, these changes are believed to produce little if any functional improvement  <cit>  and are therefore unlikely to play a major role here.

edema is a prominent feature of acute sci. vascular injury and blood–brain barrier disruption lead to vasogenic edema, which contributes to early spinal cord dysfunction  <cit> . while not measured in the present study, the volume of edematous spinal cord tissue—identified on mri as the t2-hyperintense region—has been found to be identical in an and sd rats throughout recovery from sci  <cit> . therefore, it seems unlikely that edema is responsible for strain-dependent variation in locomotor recovery.

as previously stated, we did not assess all pathophysiological processes involved in sci. reactive oxygen species production, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, and microvascular dysfunction were less well suited to gene expression-based analysis than cell death, tissue repair, and kv channel dysregulation. while the potential relationship of these unexamined processes to t cell activity is unclear, they may nevertheless contribute to the effects of t cells on functional recovery.

differences between the genomes of an and sd rats warrant consideration as well. the an rat is a homozygous rnu/rnu mutant derived from a colony of hooded rats  <cit> . to our knowledge, there is no published comparison of the an and sd genomes. functional sci outcomes are known to vary between common laboratory rat strains  <cit> , raising the possibility that non-t cell-related genes may account for the locomotor difference observed in the present study. however, the albino sd rat demonstrates higher bbb locomotor scores after sci compared to the hooded wistar and long-evans rats  <cit> . this suggests that if background genomic inequality is present, an rats are more likely at a disadvantage—rather than an advantage—compared to sd rats.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these findings implicate an altered immune response with relevant pro- and anti-inflammatory elements in the altered course of locomotor recovery of an rats. less damage by t cells—coupled with anti-inflammatory effects of th <dig> cells  and mast cells—may have led to temporary tissue preservation. the absence of superior long-term functional recovery may be due to compensatory nk cell overabundance and macrophage overproduction of inflammatory cytokines il-1a and il- <dig>  we posit that t cells promote early tissue damage, demyelination, and kv channel dysregulation after contusion sci. however, compensatory features of the immune response  may cause delayed tissue death in t cell-deficient an rats, limiting long-term recovery.

by nature, this work constitutes a broad-spectrum analysis of the role of t cell deficiency in sci. while we have identified many promising correlations between gene expression and locomotor recovery, these relationships require extensive confirmatory studies. several factors involved in the pathology of sci were not investigated in this study and may contribute to the effect of t cells on functional recovery. the mechanistic basis for certain aspects of the an immune response  remains unclear, and may serve as a basis for subsequent experiments. many studies—particularly systematic, quantitative immunohistochemistry—are thus required to corroborate and expand upon our findings.

beyond helping to further elucidate the role of t cells in recovery from spinal cord trauma, our findings may inform future investigation of therapy for sci. we have proposed that the immune consequences of t cell deficiency permit sparing of spinal cord tissue that is eventually lost in both immunodeficiency and immunocompetence. combination therapy with t cell inhibitors and other neuroprotective treatment may allow continued survival of these vulnerable tissues and produce sustained functional recovery.
