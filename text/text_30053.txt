BACKGROUND
cotton  ovule development is an interesting and unique developmental process because the differentiation and development of natural fiber, a seed epidermal trichome, occurs along with cottonseed embryogenic development  <cit> . cotton is a very important natural textile fiber source, and cottonseed is a significant food source for humans and livestock  <cit> . further, cotton fiber is not only an excellent single-celled model system to study cell elongation and cellulose biosynthesis in plants from a biological perspective, but also from a commercial perspective as the high cellulose content makes it an excellent biomass-material to produce ethanol-based biofuels  <cit> . thus, molecular genetic studies of the stage-by-stage process of ovule development is important for understanding molecular mechanisms of fiber development and the goal of effective manipulation of fiber characteristics.

cotton fiber is derived from a single cell. fiber growth involves four overlapping developmental stages: fiber initiation, elongation , wall thickening , and desiccation   <cit> . lint fiber initiation is conventionally timed at or just before anthesis  <cit> . fiber initiation is a synchronous process that usually ends at  <dig> days post anthesis , but may extend up to  <dig> dpa  <cit> . this is then followed by an elongation stage at 5– <dig> dpas, biosynthesis of secondary wall at 21– <dig> dpa, and maturation at approximately 40– <dig> dpa  <cit> . fuzz fiber initiation and development occur after initiation of lint fiber development but this, too, is subject to variation from variety to variety  <cit> .

recent advances in cotton genomics  <cit>  have led to the identification of the core genetic components contributing to the cotton fiber development and its molecular mechanisms . although these studies have elucidated many aspects of fiber development and revealed important candidate genes expressed during developmental phases  <cit> , many aspects of fiber cell differentiation remain unknown  <cit> . in particular, the potential role of small rnas, including micrornas  and endogenous silencing rnas , during ovule development remains to be determined  <cit> . characterization of these small rnas during the different stages of fiber development will contribute to identification of key molecular interactions that will, in turn, lead to better understand of the molecular mechanisms regulating cotton fiber development.

the universe of small rnas, including both the  <dig> –  <dig> nt long mirnas and the  <dig> nt long esirnas, has been expanding at an ever-increasing rate since their initial discovery in the early 1990s  <cit> . small rnas regulate their targets via transcriptional or posttranscriptional suppression either by dna or histone modifications  or direct cleavage of mrnas and translational repression   <cit> . the ~ <dig> nt size class also includes trans-acting sirnas  that, unlike other sirnas, potentially silence messages that are different from the rnas from which they have been processed, but share some level of sequence similarity. ta-sirna biogenesis is mediated by specific mirnas that process  <dig> snt size ta-sirnas from tas genes through direct cleavage  <cit> .

the impact of small rnas on a wide array of cellular processes in both plants and animals has grown to the point where it is becoming more and more difficult to find cellular processes that are not impacted by them to some degree. in plants, small rnas have been implicated in processes as diverse as flowering  <cit>  and overall cellular defense  <cit> . however, it is in development, such as fiber development in cotton, where small rnas appear to have a major role  <cit> . for this reason, we have used a size-directed small rna cloning strategy to isolate, clone, and sequence small rnas expressed in eleven dpa periods of fiber development . we sequenced more than  <dig>  clones and have identified nearly  <dig>  candidate small rnas. among these candidates, we found  <dig> unique sequence signatures. surprisingly, few of these candidates were identified as mirnas in mirbase  <cit> . the majority of the sequences we found are, rather, the  <dig> nt long signatures corresponding to esirnas like those found in arabidopsis thaliana and other plants. in addition, only  <dig> % of identified small rna sequences  were observed in more than one dpa of ovule development. while so-called "deep sequencing" using next generation platforms  <cit>  will undoubtedly increase multi-dpa representation of small rnas, our initial observations suggest that the initiation and elongation stages of cotton fiber-development are at least partially regulated by specific sets of small rnas. finally, target predictions based on ovule-derived small rna sequences indicate involvement in numerous important biological processes including processes involving previously reported fiber-associated proteins.

RESULTS
the small rna profile of 0– <dig> dpa developing ovules
we sequenced a total of  <dig> individual clones from the eleven g. hirsutum developing ovule libraries. from these clones we identified  <dig> small rnas having insert lengths between  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt. following pooling of identical insert sequences, these  <dig> clones yielded  <dig> unique sequence signatures. the distribution of small rna sequence signatures is shown in table  <dig>  as can be seen, the majority of the unique sequence signatures,  <dig> of  <dig> , lie in the  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt size range commonly associated with mirnas and esirnas. among these  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt small rna sequences the majority,  <dig> of  <dig> , correspond to the  <dig> nt length of putative esirnas. further, a total of  <dig>  unique small rna sequences from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa were represented only once . we observed more sequence diversity, as indicated both by the total number of unique sequence signatures and by sequences only represented once, among small rnas at the initial dpa periods of ovule development  than at the later dpas of ovule development. at 0– <dig> dpa more than half of the unique sequence signatures were represented in only a single clone whereas at later dpa periods the percentage dropped to around 20% . the exception to this trend was seen in  <dig> and  <dig> dpa periods where just over 40% of the clones were singletons. the most disparate results relative to the other dpas of ovule development were obtained at  <dig> dpa. even though we sequenced more clones in this period compared to other dpa periods, we only recovered five unique signatures .

gis – number of all good insert sequences per each library .

ots – number of one-time sequenced small rnas  per each library.

ncs – number of clones sequenced per each library.

among the unique sequence signatures many were found in five or more different clones. these sequence signatures appear to represent abundantly processed and more or less saturated portion of small rnas in each ovule library . these abundantly processed small rnas are 21– <dig> nt long and the prevalent ones in each dpa period varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  copies. the proportion of sequence signatureshaving ≥  <dig> copies at each dpa period nearly mirrors the proportion of single copy sequences at that dpa . moreover, there appears to be a distinct change in the pattern of small rnas after  <dig> dpa. in 0– <dig> dpa, the majority of small rnas are single copy and the proportion of sequences present in five or more clones is low. beginning at 3dpa this pattern changes. not only are there substantially fewer total sequence signatures , the majority of sequences are seen in multiple clones as opposed to single clones. only at  <dig> dpa is the early pattern seen to be present but it is represented by only  <dig> unique sequences. the combination of a great reduction in unique sequence signatures and in the ratio of single copy to multiple copy sequences following  <dig> dpa  suggests that there may be a change in the small rna regulatory environment in cotton ovules once the early patterns are established.

finally, in our data, only  <dig> %  of all cloned small rnas were found to be expressed in two or more dpa periods . among these, ten sequences were found in two dpas, one sequence in three dpas, and four sequences were expressed in four dpa periods. only 8%  of abundant-copy small rnas carried over in two or more dpas. this further demonstrates a low level of small rna carry-over from day-to-day ovule development because the abundant copy small rnas represent more saturated pools of small rnas in each day ovule library.

blast similarity search of ovule derived small rnas
although most of the small rna sequences in the ovule libraries did not match with any known genes or ests in blast analyses, several small rnas were found to have a significant  nucleotide identity homologous to gossypium derived cdna, including ests, sequenced from developing ovule library as well as ribosomal and chloroplast dna . in addition, in specific dpa periods, we found significant putative matches with known genes such as alcohol dehydrogenase a gene of gossypium, fad-dependent oxidoreductase, disulfide isomerase genes, transposons and retrotransposon elements, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, amino acid permease, armadillo/beta-catenin repeat containing protein , protein kinases, f-box protein family, transcription factors, and anion exchange proteins . blast analysis identified only three groups of small rna signatures, overlapping at two or more dpas. these three were all seen to be expressed in four different dpa period and two were identified as plant mirnas; mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  the third sequence was identified as a fragment of  <dig> s rrna. none of the other putative esirna 24-mers expressed in multiple dpa periods could be identified .

mirbase database search
because blast searches identified two known plant mirnas among the sequences expressed in two or more dpa periods, we screened all cotton ovule-derived small rnas in mirbase in an effort to identify additional mirna sequences. surprisingly, only two families of mirbase-confirmed plant mirnas were identified in the  <dig> sequences and these were the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> mirnas already identified in table  <dig>  no other definite micrornas were found. one similar sequence was detected in a 24-mer represented in  <dig> clones at  <dig> dpa. this sequence was roughly similar to mir- <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  but not similar enough to make a call one way or the other.

the putative expression profiles of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> shown in table  <dig> are consistent with the pattern shown in figure  <dig>  both mir <dig> and mir <dig> are predominantly expressed during the earliest dpas of ovule development. moreover, there are a few mature sequence differences among the clones that are consistently replicated in within-dpa copies . all of the mir- <dig> clones from  <dig> dpa and all but the  <dig> dpa mir- <dig> clones display perfect matches with canonical mature sequences from mirbase. the u→c change in position  <dig> of mir- <dig> observed in a total of  <dig> signatures of  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa clones is a perfect match for mir-172i reported in the black cottonwood, populus trichocarpa,  <cit> . the additional c→u change at position  <dig> in the single  <dig> dpa clone does not match any mir <dig> variants. similarly, the a→g change seen at position  <dig> of the single  <dig> dpa mir- <dig> clone fails to match any known variant. both of these single clone sequence differences could simply be sequencing errors whereas the mir-172i variant is too well supported to be dismissed as a sequencing error. also shown in table  <dig> are mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> sequences reported for cotton by zhang et al.  <cit>  and a mir- <dig> cotton sequence reported by qui et al.  <cit> . the qui et al. sequence is canonical but the zhang et al. sequences are very poor matches to any plant microrna.

putative small rna targets
analysis of the  <dig> small rna sequence signatures from cotton ovule using target finder  <cit>  identified a total of  <dig> possible protein targets of these small rnas . consistent with the distribution of the sequence signatures themselves, a number of these putative protein targets were specific to one day of ovule development . also consistent with the pattern of small rna expression, the relative occurrence of dpa-specific potential protein targets appears to change between  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa as their representation drops from about one-third to one-quarter of potential targets identified and the total number of targets drops off.

*#potential protein targets identifies in more than one dpa period

while such analyses are purely speculative at this early stage, an assessment of putative protein targets of our small rna sequences, based on their function gene ontology  molecular function and biological process from tair database, indicates that they are involved in numerous biological processes. these processes, which include biosynthesis/metabolism, transport, cell growth and organogenesis, gene regulation, photomorphogenesis, response to phytohormones, response to biotic/abiotic stresses, disease resistance, and dna biogenesis , are clearly congruent with what would be expected in a developmental phenomenon like that examined here. the putative protein target information for mirbase confirmed ovule mirna signatures are also listed in additional file  <dig>  demonstrating that these mirnas putatively regulate important proteins involved in transcription  and translation , metabolism and biosynthesis , transport of cations and protons , disease resistance , cytoskeleton components , ribosomal proteins , response to light stimulus , and dna biogenesis .

discussion
we have cloned and sequenced small rnas derived from eleven dpa periods  of cotton fiber development. our results support the potential importance of small rnas in developing cotton ovules. overall, we find that small rna sequences are more diverse and abundant in early development periods  than in subsequent periods . this suggests that the genetic processes regulated by small rnas in the initiation phases of ovule and fiber development are at least qualitatively different than those at later periods. whether this says that those early genetic, physiological, and biochemical mechanisms are more complex in the initiation phase than they are in other stages like the elongation phase is unknown at this point. however, it remains that the small rnas in our study were very diverse: 44% of them were represented by small rnas sequenced only once and that the majority of these were found in the earliest dpas of development. this is similar to the case of arabidopsis, in which 65% of all unique small rnas were sequenced only once  <cit> . although the material and overall approach were different from what we did here, unique small rnas represented ~38% of total reads in a genome-wide survey in arabidopsis  <cit>  while the unique small rna sequences in cotton ovules represented ~23% in our study. in addition, the fact that only a small number of unique candidate small rna sequences spanned two or more dpa periods suggests that small rna regulation in each dpa period in cotton is different. perhaps, small rna regulation in each dpa is highly specific and that shifting controlling biological processes occurs quite rapidly between days in ovule development.

a surprising finding in our study is that, out of  <dig> candidate small rna sequences from 0– <dig> dpa developing ovule tissues, only two plant mirna families  were confirmed in mirbase. there is evidence that mirnas constitute a much smaller proportion of the small rnas in plants than in animals  <cit> . our data are clearly consistent with this view. however, in our data, there are many other 21- to 23-mer small rna sequences that do not match any of the currently mirbase-annotated plant or other organism mirnas. these are potential candidates for new cotton-specific mirnas, which need to be further explored.

replicated sequence differences observed in the mature sequence of both mir <dig> and mir- <dig> suggest the existence of multiple mir <dig> and mir- <dig> family members in cotton, and potentially, there are different mir <dig> and mir- <dig> members functioning at different dpa periods. the mirbase confirmed mirnas putatively target proteins that may play an important role both in ovule embryonic and in fiber development. proteins putatively targeted by mir <dig> and mir <dig> include myb and zinc finger transcription factors, glycosyl transferease family proteins, action/hydrogen exchanger, translation initiation factors , and myosin heavy chain proteins. these proteins have been reported to be associated with fiber development, including being important components in gene regulation, in cytoskeleton and cellulose synthesis, and in proton and cation transporting  <cit> . in addition, although experimental validations are needed, other putative target proteins of mir <dig> may also be involved in the fiber development process. for example, short chain dehydrogenase/reductase  which is targeted by mir <dig> at  <dig> dpa. sdr has cellulose and pectin containing cell wall oxireductase activity and is involved in aba biosynthesis, in which aba is considered to be an important phytochormone in fiber development  <cit> . additional proteins targeted by mir <dig> that are likely candidate proteins affecting fiber development include phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  <cit> , the glutamate receptor involved in dendritic cell growth  <cit> , and yt521-b-like family proteins changing alternative splice site usage in concentration dependent manner  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, mir <dig> was reported to target tas <dig> trans-acting sirna  biogenesis through coupling with agronaute <dig>  and regulating auxin response factor <dig> . identification of at least two mir390s, of which, one is expressed at  <dig> dpa, is good evidence supporting specific involvement of mir <dig> in fiber development as auxin response is one of the most important factors in fiber initiation and elongation in cotton  <cit> . in addition, since the majority of ta-sirnas are  <dig> nt long and are hypothesized to be generated in mirna-induced cascades  <cit> , it is possible that mirnas that are expressed at different dpas of ovule development are the headwaters of within-dpa ta-sirna cascades that may be indicated here by the abundance of unique 24-mer rnas in the various dpas.

although structurally characterized  <cit> , the function of mir- <dig> is not clear in the literature. the ovule-derived candidate mir853-like small rna targets several unknown proteins in arabidopsis and cotton gene index databases. arabidopsis ath-mir <dig> matches several putative targets in cotton gene index database. of those, both extensin-like proteins and ras-related proteins are known to be involved in fiber development  <cit> . in addition, a palmitoyl – acyl carrier protein thioesterase, catalyzing the palmitic acid of the fatty acid family in plants  <cit> , could be important. the role of fatty acids  and very long chain fatty acids  in fiber development has been reported  <cit> . this suggests that mir853-like small rnas play a role in fiber development of cotton, possibly as mirnas, and requires further study.

other small rnas in both the total or in the abundant copy portion targeted many a priori fiber development-associated proteins that have been reported in previous studies. ovule-derived candidate small rnas, putatively targeted many transcription and translation factors, biosynthesis/metabolism , hormone mediated signal transduction pathways, and hormone responsive proteins and factors of all key plant phytochormones such as iaa, aba, ga, br, ethylene and cytokinin, which are known to be the key factors associated with fiber development  <cit> . other important fiber-associated factors reported in the literature are involved in the transportation of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, ions, and electrons  <cit> , in lipid and fatty acids biosynthesis/metabolism  <cit> , in cytoskleton formation  <cit> , in peroxidase activity  <cit> , in carbohydrate biosynthesis/metabolism  <cit> , and in dna biogenesis   <cit> . those factors were also found to be targeted by candidate small rnas in cotton ovules in our study. it is noteworthy to mention that ovule-derived candidate small rnas also target some of the recently highlighted proteins such as prohibitin and steroid sulfotransferase, mate efflux protein, and transducin family proteins that are differentially expressed in fiber initials  <cit> , and actin depolymerizing factors . some of which, like ghadf <dig>  are predominantly expressed in fiber tissue  <cit> . others, like the dynamin family proteins, are differentially expressed in fibers cells at  <dig> dpa period of the superior quality chromosome substitution line csb22sh  <cit> . recently, mads-box genes  <cit>  and genes of vesicle coating and trafficking  <cit>  were found to be associated with fiber development where these related proteins are targeted by ovule-derived small rnas annotated in this study.

although in silico target predictions have been shown a good tool to putatively annotate the small rna functions  <cit> , the experimental validation of the exact biological functions of small rnas in plant cells is necessary. transient expression systems using in vitro ovule culture  <cit>  with these candidate small rnas may provide a valuable tool for rapid validation of small rnas and mirnas. cloning and characterization of small rnas selectively from the fiber cells of developing ovules using a newly developed methodology  <cit>  should efficiently facilitate the identification of fiber-specific small rnas/mirnas in cotton and differentiation of fiber-specific  <cit>  versus ovule specific  <cit>  small rna signatures. in addition, characterization of small rnas/mirnas from fiber mutants such as naked seed , ligon lintless , pilose mutant , immature fiber mutant , and other fiber mutants with distinctive fiber development may help to identify key small rnas/mirnas affected by these variations and further elucidate the mechanisms of the fiber development process. annotation of small rna pools from the remaining ovule and fiber development stages  will also be important for the understanding of developmental processes such as the secondary wall deposition and maturation stages of fiber development  <cit> . consequently, with the availability of complete cotton genome sequences  <cit>  in a near future, mapping of these sirnas throughout the cotton genome will facilitate studies of structural and functional processes, biogenesis, and evolution of these ovule-derived small rnas/mirnas in cotton. these all require further attention and efforts on comprehensive studying of small rna world of complex fiber development process in cotton.

CONCLUSIONS
we have carried out an initial survey of small rna species expressed during cotton ovule development from  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa. our results provide initial evidence of extensive small rna-mediated regulation of complex ovule and fiber development processes in cotton. the majority of small rna sequence signatures observed corresponds to the  <dig> nt size characteristic of endogenous silencing rnas , and there is very little carry over between dpa periods. where there is dpa-to-dpa carry over, those sequences that have been identified are plant mirnas. the observation that there are considerably more different sequence signatures present in the earliest dpas of ovule development  than in later periods may indicate that there is a shift in the regulatory landscape after 2dpa with fewer small rnas present but in higher numbers later on. the overall patterns of small rna expression observed raise the possibility that this regulation is consistent with mirna-initiated small rna regulatory cascades potentially targeting a large number of previously known fiber-associated proteins as well as previously unknown targets. confirmation of our results, in particular the three mirbase-confirmed plant mirnas and a the large number of  <dig> nt esirnas putatively involved in fiber initiation and elongation stages of ovule development, by ongoing deep sequencing efforts will greatly facilitate understanding of the developmental mechanisms involved.
