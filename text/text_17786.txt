BACKGROUND
escherichia coli is a model prokaryotic organism, an important pathogen and commensal, and a popular host for biotechnological applications. among thousands of isolates, only four strains  and their derivatives are designated as risk group  <dig> organisms in biological safety guidelines  <cit> . a fifth strain, e. coli crooks , has also been used extensively in laboratories for over  <dig> years  <cit> ; more recently, it has been used as a host for industrial biochemical production  <cit> . there have been no reported cases of the strain being pathogenic, suggesting that it is generally safe. when it was sequenced in  <dig>  atcc  <dig> was designated as a c strain  <cit> , however, it is in fact a crooks strain  <cit>  and recent publications have reflected this correction  <cit> . of these five safe strains, k- <dig>  <cit> , b  <cit>  and crooks  have been sequenced, but c and w have not.

e. coli w  was originally isolated from the soil of a cemetery near rutgers university around  <dig> by selman a. waksman, around the same time he and alan schatz discovered streptomycin . waksman coined the term 'antibiotic', and his discovery of streptomycin  led to him being awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  <dig>  the strain was termed "waksman's strain" or "w strain" because it showed the highest sensitivity to streptomycin compared to other isolated e. coli strains in waksman's collection .

the first reported use of w was as the standard e. coli strain in the assay for sensitivity to streptomycin and other antibiotics  <cit> . bernard davis, a prominent microbiologist from harvard medical school, developed a large auxotrophic mutant library from the strain  <cit>  using his penicillin-based selection technique  <cit> . one of these mutants, vitamin b- <dig> auxotroph 113- <dig> , is well known as a production strain for penicillin g acyclase   <cit>  and for studies of aromatic compound degradation in bacteria  <cit> . it has also recently been discovered that the popular ethanol-producing strain ko <dig>  <cit>  is a w strain rather than a b strain as previously thought  <cit> . both w and ko <dig> have been engineered for the production of several chemicals, including ethanol  <cit> , poly-3-hydroxybutyrate <cit> , lactic acid  <cit>  and alanine  <cit> . the w strain has several properties that make it a preferred strain for industrial applications. it produces low amounts of acetate even without tight sugar control, and can be grown to high cell density during fed-batch culture with relative ease  <cit> . it also has good tolerance for environmental stresses such as high ethanol concentrations, acidic conditions, high temperatures and osmotic stress  <cit> . it is a very fast growing strain; its superior growth rate on lb medium compared to classical k-12-derived strains has led to it being developed as a lab cloning strain  <cit> . these combined characteristics make w extremely attractive as a production strain. significantly, w is the only safe e. coli strain which can utilize sucrose as a carbon source, and it grows as fast on sucrose as it does on glucose  <cit> . sucrose is emerging as a preferred carbon source for industrial fermentation: life cycle analysis demonstrates that sucrose from sugarcane has a superior performance when compared to glucose from starch  <cit> .

modern development of good production strains entails application of metabolic engineering principles. increasingly, metabolic engineering relies on a systems biology approach  <cit> ; a key aspect of this approach is the integration of a metabolic model . the first step in developing a gem is to build an in silico genome-scale reconstruction  derived from the organism's genome sequence. in this paper, we present the complete genome sequence, detailed annotation of e. coli w. comparative genome analyses were performed among safe e. coli strains and group b <dig> commensal/pathogenic e. coli strains. in addition, a comprehensive, w-specific gsr was developed to underpin construction of a gem for engineering industrial production strains.

RESULTS
annotation and comparative analysis with other safe laboratory strains
a combination of roche/ <dig> pyrosequencing, fosmid end sequencing and sanger sequencing was used to obtain the complete genome sequence of e. coli w . the w genome consists of a circular chromosome   and two plasmids, prk <dig>  and prk <dig> . detailed results of genome analysis can be found in table  <dig>  at  <dig>  kbp, the chromosome of e. coli w is the largest of all the sequenced safe laboratory strains. comparison with available e. coli genome sequences in genbank demonstrated that it is similar in size to the commensal e. coli strain se <dig>   <cit> , but smaller than most sequenced pathogenic strains. a total of  <dig>  chromosomal genes  were predicted using prodigal  <cit>  and glimmer <cit> ; these genes cover 89% of the chromosome.

a ssrs is annotated as an rrna in crooks but in k- <dig> and w it is annotated as an ncrna. it is included in this table as an ncrna

the total number of genes, trna, other ncrnas and is elements in each strain includes pseudogenes/pseudo-trnas etc.; the number of pseudo-elements in each case is in noted in brackets. a '+' means the element is present; a '-' means the element is absent. nd = not determined in annotation. safe laboratory strains: w  and its plasmids prk <dig> and prk2; k- <dig> ; b ; and crooks . w is in phylogroup b1; k- <dig>  b and crooks are in phylogroup a.

a wide variety of algorithms were used to predict and annotate coding and non-coding genes . like the three other sequenced laboratory strains, w has  <dig> rrna genes expressed from  <dig> rrna operons; these operons are present at similar locations in all four genomes. the four strains share  <dig> trnas and there are four unshared trnas located in large mobile elements. w has thrx and tyrx, which occur within a variable region of the rac*w prophage and are homologous to thru and tyru of e. coli k-12; due to separate is-mediated deletions, w and b are both missing a trna which occurs upstream of ypjc in k-12; in k- <dig>  iley is present. in crooks the sequence of a trna in the same location is identical to iley of k- <dig> but has been mis-annotated as a trna-met <dig> variant.

all-against-all blastp comparison of chromosomal protein-coding orthologs among the four safe laboratory strains  showed that of  <dig>  predicted cdss in w,  <dig>  are shared among these four strains. another  <dig> are found in at least one other strain, leaving  <dig> cdss that are unique to w. consistent with the larger genome size, this is ~320- <dig> more cdss than were found to be unique in any other safe strain. it should be noted that the number of shared orthologs between strains is not an indicator of overall relatedness, since increases in shared genes tends to arise from large insertion elements . furthermore, differences in genome sizes bias this kind of relationship comparison.

e. coli strains can be divided into five different ecor phylogroups  based on the sequences of housekeeping genes  <cit> . commensal strains are found primarily in group a or group b <dig>  which are sister groups, while pathogenic strains are generally found in group b <dig>  d and e  <cit> . a phylogenetic tree was constructed by sequence concatenation of seven housekeeping genes  <cit>  . using this approach, w was assigned to group b <dig>  group b <dig> contains a large number of commensal strains  <cit> . the other three sequenced safe strains , are all members of phylogroup a  <cit> . interestingly, these groupings are consistent with genome sizes of sequenced strains: group b <dig> strains have larger genomes than group a strains. w is arguably a more appropriate strain than k- <dig>  b or crooks for comparison with commensal and pathogenic strains of phylogroup b <dig> 

plasmids
an early report suggested that e. coli w contains three plasmids  <cit> . however, it was later suggested that w contains only two plasmids  <cit> . our sequence data confirmed the latter report: w contains two plasmids, prk <dig> and prk <dig>  prk <dig> is a circular plasmid of  <dig>  bp. it encodes  <dig> genes:  <dig> protein coding genes, one pseudogene and three ncrnas . blast analysis demonstrated that it belongs to incompatibility group i <dig>  and has high structural similarity with the inci plasmids pr <dig> , pse11- <dig> , and pcolib-p <dig>  analysis of inc, a marker for inci designations  <cit> , showed that inc in prk <dig> differed by only one base pair from the reference inc of inc i <dig> subgroup iγ  <cit> . inci <dig> plasmids are characterized by the presence of genes encoding a thick pilus, a thin type ivb pilus, the pilus-associated protein gene pilv, and the dna primase gene sog  <cit> .

genes for antibiotic resistance are found on most sequenced inci plasmids, including inci <dig> plasmids  <cit>  and inciγ-type r621a  <cit> ; however, prk <dig> does not encode any antibiotic resistance genes. this is desirable in industrial strains as genetic manipulation for strain improvement often involves the use of antibiotic selection. in addition, an is <dig> insertion has interrupted two genes involved in colicin production . this insertion also resulted in the introduction of genes involved in κ-type fimbriae .

the trba-exc region in inci <dig> plasmids is a diverse region and includes genes that are involved in plasmid maintenance and transfer. prk <dig> contains a complete trb regulon, which is required for plasmid transfer. two other genes are of interest: excab, which controls surface exclusion and thus determines which plasmid types can conjugate into the host cell, and pndca, which controls plasmid stability  <cit> . in prk <dig>  pndca has been lost, suggesting that plasmid stability might be affected even though there is no direct evidence that prk <dig> is unstable in w. in addition, the 3' region of exc differs greatly from other exc genes on inci <dig> plasmids, suggesting that this gene encodes a protein which determines different mating specificity than other inci plasmids.

plasmid prk <dig> has been sequenced previously  <cit>  and our analysis is in agreement with the reported information. briefly, prk <dig> is a cryptic cole1-type plasmid; it is  <dig>  bp and encodes  <dig> predicted genes including  <dig> protein-coding genes and one non-coding rna. it is stably inherited and contains four putative mobilisation genes and a gene encoding a rom protein. it shares 99% identity with pse11- <dig>  a plasmid isolated from the group b <dig> commensal e. coli se <dig>  <cit> .

finally, there is some evidence that e. coli w once harbored a third plasmid. an is <dig> insertion in prk <dig>  is homologous to a region in pse11- <dig>  an incf plasmid from e. coli se <dig>  <cit> . the insertion has deleted a region of prk <dig> which is normally found in inci plasmids. additionally, the partial fimbrial gene cluster which was transferred with the insertion is known to be plasmid-encoded  <cit> . w and se <dig> belong to the same phylogroup and therefore might share a common ancestry; furthermore, two of the se <dig> plasmids are highly similar to prk <dig> and prk <dig> . thus, it seems likely that an ancestral w strain might have harbored a plasmid similar to pse11- <dig> 

mobility elements and defence systems
e. coli genomes consist of a conserved core interspersed with variable regions encoding accessory functions  <cit> . the conserved core is shared with closely related genera such as citrobacter  <cit> , shigella  <cit>  and salmonella  <cit> . the accessory genome encodes lifestyle-specific functions which are often found in large clusters or related genes   <cit> . these clusters contain a different g+c content compared to the rest of the genome  and are acquired through horizontal gene transfer  via natural transformation, bacteriophage-mediated transduction or conjugation.

mobility elements
large genomic islands which are flanked by mobility elements are known as large mobile elements , and include prophages or phage-like elements   <cit> . differentiation between prophages and ples can be difficult; in general, a prophage will contain specific metabolic and structural genes associated with a prophage, while a ple will contain an integrase and very few regions which are homologous to known prophages. lmes carry large complements of genes which might confer a variety of metabolic attributes. e. coli w has six prophages and three ples, the latter of which we have designated 'e. coli w phage like elements' . a detailed list of lmes in e. coli w and other safe strains can be found in table  <dig> 

a prophage type is unknown

b kple <dig> p <dig> integrase is interrupted by is3

a '-' means that no mobile element was found at that insertion site. prophage types are shown in brackets. strains are w , k- <dig> , b , crooks .

a total of twenty-eight lmes are annotated amongst the safe e. coli strains. they are spread out over nineteen different sites in the chromosome and all but one can be classified as either a ple or one of three different prophages . the exception is the mu prophage, a transpositional phage that inserts into almost random chromosomal locations  <cit> ; among the four strains, mu prophage is only found in w. none of the lmes in w encode any genes of particular note. in the other strains, a few genes of interest are encoded on prophages. rybb*b carries retron ec <dig>  <cit> , which encodes a reverse transcriptase that is missing from rybb*c and rybb*w. the p <dig> prophage cp4- <dig> is absent in w and crooks but present in k-12; the flu gene is encoded on this prophage in k- <dig> and is encoded on phev*b in b. the λ prophage is the most promiscuous prophage element among the four strains.

ten ples are found among safe strains. only kple <dig> is shared . e. coli crooks might have harboured kple2: it contains a  <dig> bp pseudogene, the first  <dig> bp of which shares 72% identity with the p4-integrases of kple <dig> in k- <dig> and b. kple <dig> contains the fec regulon  and the sgc operon, which is involved in pentose and pentitol sugar breakdown  <cit> . k- <dig> contains kple <dig>  which includes the gtrab regulon encoding a bactoprenol glucosyl-transferase involved in o-antigen modification. the crooks strain harbours cple <dig>  which contains an endonuclease, and cple <dig> which also contains a fec regulon. the wple <dig> of w appears to comprise two separate ples, as a second p4-integrase is found with distinct regions of dna following each integrase. the first region contains a toxin-antitoxin system while the second region contains a putative 5-methylcytosine restriction system.

insertion sequences  play an important role in the cell's ability to evolve and adapt to new environments  <cit> . a complete description of the is elements in safe strains can be found in table  <dig>  only two iss are conserved among all four strains; as previously reported  <cit> , no copies of is <dig> were found within the w genome. the w genome contains  <dig> is elements, which is significantly fewer than k- <dig>  b or crooks; as a consequence, w has no is-related gene inactivation occurring in the chromosome, whereas k- <dig> and b both have a number of genes inactivated. these include genes involved in lipopolysaccharide  and capsular polysaccharide  synthesis, as well as large deletions such as the  <dig> kbp region between uvry and hcha in b which removes the flag- <dig> flagella-encoding gene cluster .

b found on plasmid prk1

c annotated as predicted transposase in k- <dig>  genome . predicted to be is <dig> by isfinder

d annotated as isx in k- <dig>  genome. predicted to be isehe <dig> by isfinder

genes encoded on insertion sequences are noted; the number of additional pseudogenes is noted in brackets. strains are w , k- <dig> , b , crooks .

restriction modification and crispr systems
restriction modification and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat  systems play an important role in antiviral defence against invasive foreign genetic material  and hence control the extent of hgt  <cit> . restriction capabilities are conferred by the immigration control region  <cit> . both w and crooks are restriction minus as they lack hsdmrs, mcrbc and mrr, which encode the restriction modification complexes. in w, this cluster has been replaced by the pac gene encoding a penicillin g acyclase , which catalyses the breakdown of penicillin g into phenylacetic acid and 6-aminopenicillanic acid  <cit> . this capability has been exploited for the industrial production of pga using e. coli w  <cit> . in crooks, the immigration control region has undergone multiple changes due to is element insertions. the lack of restriction modification systems in w and crooks suggests that these strains are less able to inactivate foreign dna.

crispr systems inhibit horizontal gene transfer. the detailed mechanisms have just begun to be exposed  <cit> . recently, two crispr systems have been described in e. coli: crispr <dig> and crispr <dig>  <cit> . these systems differ by the presence or absence of crispr associated sequence  proteins , and by the location, number and sequence of repeats. e. coli w contains three crispr <dig> arrays, crispr <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . genes encoding e. coli cas proteins are present next to crispr <dig> . w also contains the crispr <dig> - <dig> array but not the associated yersinia pestis cas proteins, which are found in many e. coli strains  <cit> . each safe strain has the same number of arrays, but the sequences and number of repeat regions varies . there are two cas gene clusters found in e. coli which vary in the cas3-cse <dig> region; it is unclear if they have the same function  <cit> . one is found in k- <dig> and crooks and the other is found in w and o <dig>  multiple insertions and deletions have destroyed the cas gene cluster in e. coli b.

strains are w , k- <dig> , b , and crooks .

virulence/fitness factors
virulence factors are classically considered to be associated with host interactions and pathogenicity. however, it should be noted that many of these so-called virulence factors can also be considered fitness factors in a non-virulence context  <cit> . for example, adhesins are important for colonizing all manner of niches; colonisation does not necessarily lead to infection and disease.

serotypic antigens
e. coli serotypes are defined according to the polysaccharide component of lps molecules  <cit> . these include cpss, which can be either k-antigen or colonic acid  and o-polysaccharides . the h-antigen is used for serotyping, and its type is usually determined by flic, a flagellar structural protein  <cit> . hgt of the gene regions responsible for production of o-antigen, k-antigen, h-antigen, and the lps core has lead to a high degree of variability  <cit> . there are  <dig> different o-antigen types and  <dig> k-antigen types currently recorded amongst e. coli. whereas other safe e. coli strains have accumulated is-mediated deletions in antigenic clusters , w has intact clusters. it has an r <dig> type lps core and an o <dig> type o-antigen. type o <dig> is widely distributed and found both in uropathogenic e. coli  strains and in commensal strains  <cit> . w does not produce a k-antigen, but it has the gene cluster involved in colonic acid synthesis; colonic acid resembles k-antigen group ia capsular polysaccharides  <cit> . it also has the phosphorelay regulon  which activates production of colonic acid. flic homology suggests that e. coli w produces an h <dig> type h-antigen  <cit> . w can thus be antigenically characterised as e. coli w  ca+.

adhesins
fimbriae and other adhesins determine whether e. coli can bind to and colonise specific environments, including different types of cells. they are associated with virulence in pathogenic strains of e. coli such as enteroaggregative e. coli  <dig>   <cit>  but are also key to the fitness of probiotic e. coli strains such as strain nissle  <dig>  as they allow it to colonize the human intestine  <cit> . in w, there are thirteen chromosomal gene clusters involved in fimbrial biosynthesis, and most of these are conserved among the safe strains of e. coli . differences arise in genes encoding the fimbrial usher protein and the tip adhesins. tip adhesins are important determinants of host cell specificity during pathogenesis; the usher protein is a membrane protein which is involved in the assembly of a fimbria and determines which group the fimbria belongs to  <cit> .

b crooks contains a related γ <dig> fimbrial found in e. coli o157:h <dig> at this location

c cluster location in e. coli k- <dig> mg1655

d cluster located on w prk1

a '+'means the element is present; a '-' means the element is absent. where some genes from the cluster are deleted, this is noted as e.g. egoabc. if a different gene fimbria gene cluster is present in the insertion site, the alternative gene cluster is noted. safe laboratory strains are w , k- <dig> , b , and crooks . w is in phylogroup b1; k- <dig>  b, and crooks are in phylogroup a.

there are  <dig> α-type fimbrial gene clusters in w: ecpabc-yagw-ecpe, and a novel fimbrial gene cluster found between exut and exur. we have designated this novel cluster e. coli α-type fimbria, eafabcd. however, neither of the clusters in w contains a gene encoding for the tip adhesin protein, which is found in other α-type fimbrial clusters and is responsible for cell binding  <cit> . thus, it is unlikely that the w α-type fimbriae can function in pathogenesis or colonisation of cells in general.

w contains five γ1-type fimbrial gene clusters. one of these is e. coli ycbq laminin-binding fimbria   <cit>  which is shared between group b <dig> strains. in w, the major subunit protein elfa is relatively different  from that found in k- <dig> and o157:h <dig> edl <dig>  deletion of this gene in o157:h <dig> edl <dig> has been shown to lead to a significant reduction in ability to adhere to hek <dig> cells  <cit> . a γ1-type cluster found in e. coli o157:h <dig> and annotated as ecs2113-ecs <dig>  is also present in w. this cluster is also present in e. coli k- <dig> , but a deletion removes ecs2113-ecs <dig> and truncates ecs <dig> . we have designated this gene cluster e. coli γ-type  <dig>  with the operon consequently designated egoabcdef. information on the other three γ1-type fimbrial gene clusters is limited but all are found in k- <dig> and are cryptic or poorly expressed under classic laboratory conditions  <cit> .

two groups of fimbriae closely related to γ1-type fimbriae and known as long polar fimbriae  <cit>  are also found in e. coli w. they are commonly found in both pathogenic and commensal strains of e. coli and consist of 3- <dig> genes. the first cluster, lpfa1-e <dig>  is found in other e. coli group b <dig> strains  and shows 44-77% amino acid identity to the lpf gene cluster of salmonella enterica. the adherence of lpfa1-e <dig> homologs in other e. coli strains is known to vary depending on both the sequence of the gene cluster and on its regulation  <cit> . the second cluster, lpfa2-d <dig>  is identical to the lpf operon found in e. coli  <dig>  this lpf operon has been shown to produce the fimbria responsible for adherence to human hek <dig> cells  <cit> .

there are also three π-type fimbrial gene clusters in w and the other safe strains. one of these, located between sixa-yfcn and consisting of seven genes, shows >95% sequence identity with a fimbrial gene cluster located in the same chromosomal position in o157:h <dig>  in o157:h <dig>  this cluster is annotated as ecs3222-ecs3216; we have designated it e. coli π-type one, with the operon consequently designated epoa-h.

due to an insertion event on prk <dig>  w has five of the eight genes from the κ-type csh fimbrial gene cluster. however, the lack of the terminal three genes most likely renders this cluster non-functional.

antigen- <dig> is a protein which works synergistically with fimbriae to promote adhesion  <cit> . it is encoded by the flu gene on the prophage cp4- <dig>  <cit> , which is present in e. coli k- <dig> and b, but is absent in w; consequently, antigen- <dig> is also absent in w.

pili are involved in gene transfer and thus in obtaining pathogenicity factors and other elements. they also affect biofilm formation, which is an important consideration for industrial fermentation. plasmid prk <dig> contains the 14-gene pil cluster which encodes a type ivb thin pilus involved in liquid mating  <cit> . in contrast to r <dig> and colib-p <dig>  prk <dig> does not contain the recombinase gene rci or repeat-flanked shufflon regions that increase the host adhesion variability of the thin pilus  <cit> . in addition, there are mutations in pils and pilu, which encode essential functions for pilus activity. the resulting pils protein has three amino acid mutations at positions where mutations have been shown to limit or inactivate pilus function  <cit> . pilu has three amino acid mutations at positions which severely affect transfer frequency  <cit> . furthermore, the pils and pilu proteins have an additional  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid changes, respectively, at positions which have not been previously characterised. additionally, e. coli c producing the pilva-type thin pilus forms cell aggregates in liquid culture due to the pilus activity  <cit> , whereas e. coli w does not . all of these considerations suggest that e. coli w does not form thin pili.

plasmid prk <dig> also contains a set of transfer genes, comprising  <dig> genes over  <dig> operons, which encode a thick pilus involved in both surface and liquid mating  <cit> . the prk <dig> complement includes all but one of the tra genes: the traabcd operon is incomplete as it is missing trad, a non-essential thick pilus protein of unknown function  <cit> .

secretion systems
secretion systems are required for the transport of proteins across the cell membrane and play a role in virulence  <cit>  and fitness  <cit> . the conservation of core genes between flagellar systems and type iii secretion systems has led some authors to recognise the flagellar export mechanism as a type of secretion system  <cit> . consequently, there are seven secretion systems in e. coli  <cit> .

flagella are required for cellular propulsion. there are two flagella systems in e. coli  <cit> . in addition to the well known flag- <dig> flagellar cluster common in e. coli, w has a flag- <dig> gene cluster. the flag- <dig> locus has been found in many genera of gammaproteobacteria, including vibrio parahaemolyticus  <cit> , escherichia coli  <cit> , yersinia enterolitica  <cit> , citrobacter rodentium  <cit>  and aeromonas hydrophila  <cit> . the v. parahaemolyticus and a. hydrophilia flag- <dig> systems have been shown to be active experimentally  <cit> . in e. coli, it is found in some strains but not others; it was originally assigned in e. coli  <dig> by homology  <cit>  but has never been shown experimentally to be functional. in e. coli  <dig>  lfgc , which encodes a rod protein required for protein export through the outer membrane, has a frameshift mutation, suggesting that the flag- <dig> system is not functional. in support of this, a swarming motility assay was negative  <cit> . e. coli w and crooks both contain a flag- <dig> locus. the lfgc genes are not mutated, but a two-gene toxin/anti-toxin system found in  <dig> between lafw and lafz is absent. both strains are missing moty, which encodes a motor protein essential for swarming in v. parahaemolyticus; in addition, they do not contain maf- <dig>  a modification accessory factor essential for a functional lateral flagellar in a. hydrophilia  <cit> . w  contains a mu prophage located in a non-coding region of the flag- <dig> locus . together, these observations suggest that the flag- <dig> locus is not functional in e. coli w or in crooks. in k- <dig> and b, all that is left of the flag- <dig> system are the two terminal remnants, fhia  and mbha   <cit> .

a swarming motility assay was performed to examine functionality of the flag- <dig> locus . consistent with loss of the flag- <dig> locus, e. coli b does not swarm. however, despite the loss of what appear to be essential flag- <dig> genes, w and cooks strains both swarm. although the swarming assay has been used to assess flag- <dig> activity  <cit> , it should be stressed that the test is not specific to flag- <dig>  e. coli k- <dig>  which has clearly lost the flag- <dig> locus, shows very limited swarming; however a k- <dig> mutant  exhibits a swarming phenotype even though it does not contain a flag- <dig> locus  <cit> . further analysis by specific deletion will be required to determine whether or not the flag- <dig> locus is active in w.

there are two type ii secretion systems  in e. coli. t2sss are required for toxin export from cells  <cit>  as well as a variety of other proteins which affect fitness for specific environments  <cit> . e. coli k- <dig>  b, and crooks all carry a repressed 14-gene t2ss gene cluster   <cit> . this t2ss has been lost in w due to a gspo-rpsj deletion. both w and b  carry the second t2ss gene cluster . unlike e. coli b, in which gspl is truncated, all genes in w appear functional. however, it should be noted that unlike k- <dig>  which can export chitinase through an expressed t2ss  <cit> , the w genome does not contain any known genes encoding enzymes or toxins that can be exported through t2sss.

type iii secretion systems  inject effector proteins into recipient cells leading to pathogenic or pro-survival responses  <cit> . there are two t3sss in e. coli: the e. coli type iii secretion systems  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . ett <dig> is absent in all four sequenced laboratory strains. remnants of the ett <dig> locus can be found in all of them, but they do not have a functional ett <dig>  mutational attrition of ett <dig> is common in e. coli strains  <cit> .

type vi secretion system  gene clusters consist of  <dig> to  <dig> genes and have been identified in numerous gram-negative proteobacteria  <cit> . in some t6sss, the genes encoding the secreted proteins, vgr and hcp, are found in different locations of the genome  <cit> , but commonly next to rhs genes  <cit> . this is the case in w, which contains two t6sss. the structure of the first gene cluster is homologous to the system previously described in e. coli o157:h <dig> sakai  <cit> . it consists of  <dig> genes and is termed the 'enterohaemorrhagic e. coli type six secretion system cluster'   <cit> . however, this system is found in numerous other non-pathogenic strains, including se <dig> and hs . a second t6ss is located downstream of metv and is homologous to the t6ss found in e. coli cft <dig>  <cit> , also located downstream of metv. we have designated this cluster escherichia coli type six secretion system cluster  <dig>  as the ehs is cluster  <dig>  in w, it is most likely deactivated due to an is621-mediated insertion. w is the only safe strain which contains a t6ss, although none of the effector molecules which are transported into host cells  <cit>  are present. therefore, this system is unlikely to function in pathogenicity.

rearrangement hot spot  elements
rhs elements are large highly repetitive regions; they constitute roughly 1% of the e. coli genome  <cit> . they are composed of four elements: a clade-specific n-terminal domain, a core domain, a hyperconserved domain, and a variable c-terminal domain  <cit> . often, partial core domain and variable c-termini regions  are observed downstream of intact rhs genes. these are proposed to play a role in intra-rhs variability  <cit> . c-terminal tips have occasionally been annotated as insertion sequences in the isfinder database due to the presence of an h-repeat , although transposition activity has not been observed  <cit> . e. coli w contains seven rhs genes , two of which are deactivated due to frame-shift mutations. of the remaining five, four have downstream c-terminal tips of varying number. both crooks and w also possess type iv rhs elements; these are missing in k- <dig> and b.

positions are based on k- <dig> annotation . the number of c-terminal tips is shown in brackets. strains are w , k- <dig> , b , and crooks .

we performed a comparison between w and other sequenced group b <dig> strains, including the commensal strains se <dig> and iai <dig>  and a variety of pathogenic strains: eaec strain  <dig>  etec strain e24377a, and ehec strains o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> . the chromosome size is relatively variable, ranging from  <dig>  mbp  to  <dig>  mbp . a backbone genome can be defined for each strain by subtracting the lmes  from the total genome size . interestingly, the size of this backbone genome is very similar  for all strains. the backbone sequences are not identical; differences are found primarily in the presence or absence of large structural elements encoding secretion systems  and adhesins. for example, the flag- <dig> is found w and the two ehec strains o <dig> and o <dig>  . w has the largest backbone genome  as it has the largest number of large structural elements . no group b <dig> strain contained the t2ss gspa-gspo which is present in group a. e. coli. w contains the smallest number of insertion sequences of all b <dig> strains; these sequences also play a role in attrition, since recombination between them may result in loss of large regions of dna  <cit> . additionally, each of the group b <dig> strains examined contains the csc regulon for permease-mediated sucrose utilisation.

the total number of genes, trna, other ncrnas and is elements in each strain includes pseudogenes/pseudo-trnas etc.; the number of pseudo-elements in each case is noted in brackets. note that ncrnas are not annotated/incompletely annotated in se <dig> and e24377a, respectively; conseqeunctly, the absolute number of genes shown for these strains is inaccurate. nd = not determined in annotation.

presence  or absence  of large structural elements in group b <dig> strains. flag- <dig> & flag- <dig> refers to the two flagellar systems found in e. coli. t2ss refers to the second type two secretion system . ett <dig> & ett <dig> are the e. coli type iii secretion systems. ehs is the enterohemorrhagic type six secretion system, and etss <dig> is the escherichia coli type six secretion system.

a key observation arising from the group b <dig> comparison is that most virulence factors are found in lmes outside the backbone genome . for example, in the ehec strains, the lee is encoded on an lme, while shiga toxins are encoded on lambdoid phages; and in e24377a, the enterotoxin and cs <dig> fimbriae are encoded on plasmid pe24377a_79; and in  <dig>  the aggregative adhesion fimbrial operon is also plasmid-borne. while each strain had a number of lambdoid prophages present in its genome, only ehec strains contained lambdoid prophages which encode the t3ss effectors which enhance virulence in these strains . the presence of essential virulence factors on lmes is consistent with previous findings, which have shown that non-pathogenic strains can be made pathogenic by introduction of elements found on lmes  <cit> . fitness factors related to colonisation of ecological niches not related to pathogenicity can also be found encoded on lmes.

genome-scale reconstruction and metabolic profiling
gsms are in silico metabolic models built using the collection of reactions that can be predicted from the annotated genome of an organism together with experimental data. they are used for many applications, including production strain design, examining evolutionary relationships, and linking phenotype and genotype information  <cit> . gsms can be used to examine theoretical flux phenotypes, atp maintenance, and redox balance requirements of cells under various genotypic and environmental conditions. these considerations allow prediction of growth rates and other characteristics such as organic acid production under specific conditions of interest. gsms allow one to examine the effect of network alterations by performing in silico gene knock-out and gain-of-function experiments prior to labour-intensive and expensive wet-lab experiments. the first step in building a gsm is to reconstruct the metabolic network using the annotated genome .

numerous metabolic differences were observed between e. coli w and the other safe e. coli strains. in order to capture these differences, a gsr was constructed for e. coli w. protein-coding genes from w were compared with those annotated in the e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig> model, iaf <dig>  <cit>  using autograph  <cit> . additional reactions were added or removed based on analyses of growth phenotypes, in silico simulations, and bibliomics . the resulting w model, ica <dig>  includes  <dig>  genes represented by  <dig>  metabolites and  <dig>  reactions . relative to the k- <dig> model, ica <dig> is missing  <dig> genes that were not present in the w genome . conversely, ica <dig> contains  <dig> new genes, including  <dig> found in k- <dig> which had not previously been annotated . forty-eight genes found in the k- <dig> model, representing  <dig> reactions, were not included in ica <dig> as no functional orthologs were present in the w genome. in terms of modelling biomass formation, the most important difference between the two models was found in the production of membrane components. fourteen genes involved in lps synthesis in k- <dig> were not found in w and twelve lps genes found in w were not found in k- <dig>  several genes common to both strains but not previously represented in the k- <dig> model were found. these included seven genes involved in the modification of lps, specifically the inner core consisting of kdo2-lipid a; two genes involved in the transport of peptidoglycan from the cytoplasm into the periplasmic space; and twelve genes involved the phenylacetic acid degradation pathway. seven genes in the k- <dig> model were located on phage regions, whereas no genes encoding metabolic reactions relevant to the model were found in phage regions in the w genome. the localisation of gene-protein-reaction information was also refined relative to the k- <dig> model. carbon and nitrogen source utilization were investigated using biolog™ phenotype arrays  in order to characterise the metabolism of the strain and further refine the gsr. all of these refinements allow improved resolution of pathways involved in metabolism in our model. comparative analyses between k- <dig> and w were made both at genome and phenome levels  <cit>  . in addition, comparative studies were done between all four safe strains where appropriate. key differences are detailed below.

carbon and nitrogen source utilization
sugars are ubiquitous throughout the environment and their breakdown supplies a key source of carbon and energy for bacteria. sucrose is the main carbohydrate transport molecule in plants, and is therefore the most abundant disaccharide encountered in most environments. a key metabolic difference between e. coli w and the other three safe strains is the ability of e. coli w to grow on sucrose. this is due to the presence of the csc regulon, which was originally described in e. coli ec <dig> and encodes a regulator , a sucrose transporter , an invertase  and a fructokinase   <cit> . the csc regulon has been inserted between the highly variable argw gene region and the dsdx gene of the d-serine regulon  <cit> . due to the insertion in dsdx, a d-serine transporter, e. coli w has lost the ability to utilize d-serine.

several operons have been identified in e. coli strains for uptake and metabolism of cellobiose, a glucose disaccharide formed by hydrolysis of cellulose. the four safe strains contain only the six gene bgl regulon for cellobiose metabolism. this operon has been reported to be silenced in wild-type e. coli strains  <cit>  and k- <dig> is unable to grow on cellobiose  <cit> . in contrast, w displays weak growth on cellobiose, indicating that the bgl genes are not silenced. uptake of the β-glycosides salicin and arbutin is generally seen in conjunction with cellobiose uptake  <cit> , though e. coli w exhibited growth only on salicin. the absence of the arbutin transporter gene arbt  <cit>  is the most likely explanation for lack of growth on arbutin.

the pentose monosaccharide d-ribose is a key component of dna and rna; d-allose is a ribose analog. ribose can be transported into the cell  <cit>  and enter amino acid and pentose phosphate pathways after it is phosphorylated; allose can be converted to fructose-6-phosphate  <cit>  for entry into central carbon metabolism. the d-allose transporter can also transport d-ribose  <cit> . in contrast to the other safe strains, w is unable to catabolise ribose or allose; this is explained by the absence of the rbsdacbkr  <cit>  and alsbacek  <cit>  regulons in w.

many environmental applications require industrial strains to break down aromatic compounds, which are typically found in soil and water. this capability varies between safe strains. w is able to break down the widest range of aromatic compounds among four strains  <cit> . unlike the other strains, k- <dig> is unable to break down 3- and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acids as it does not contain the eleven-gene hpa gene cluster  <cit> .

both k- <dig> and w can break down phenylacetic acid due to the presence of paa gene cluster. e. coli b has lost this cluster due to an is3-mediated insertion while crooks has an intact paa gene cluster and can presumably also break down phenylacetic acid. e. coli w was isolated from soil, which may help explain its capability to break down diverse aromatic compounds. in addition, loss of extraneous carbon source genes can be observed in strains maintained for long periods on laboratory carbon sources  <cit> . since w was archived shortly after isolation, it is less likely to have undergone this selective pressure.

d-galactosamine is a constituent of animal glycoprotein hormones while n-acetyl-d-galactosamine  is a core component of peptidoglycan. both are important nitrogen sources. w shares with b and crooks the agav-i gene cluster, which is involved in d-galactosamine and nag catabolism  <cit> . this cluster has been partially lost in k- <dig> due to deletion of agaef.

in k- <dig>  two separate base pair insertions in ilvg result in valine sensitivity  <cit> . when k- <dig> is grown with valine as a nitrogen source, valine accumulation results in positive inhibition of the branched chain amino acid synthesis pathway and a subsequent deficit of isoleucine and leucine. ilvg is intact in w, b and crooks; consequently, these strains are likely to have high l-valine tolerance.

there are a number of discrepancies between model predictions and phenotype array data . in some cases, c and n sources which can be used by w and k- <dig> according to the phenotype array data are not supported by model predictions. this can be explained by insufficient annotation of metabolic pathways for many of these c and n sources. in other cases, the models predict utilization of c and n sources which do not support growth  in phenotype arrays; in these cases, it is likely that specific conditions  are not met in the phenotype assay.

other metabolic considerations
inorganic ions such as iron and cobalt play important roles in many biological processes, and there are many uptake systems available for different ionic forms. w differs from other safe strains in two ion transport systems. firstly, it does not contain the seven-gene tonb-dependant diferric dicitrate uptake system, fecirabcde. in k- <dig> and b, this gene cluster is located within the phage-like element kple <dig>  secondly, it has a cobalt transport system, cbiq-o <dig>  located in the region epd-yggc; this transport system is not present in the other three strains.

CONCLUSIONS
e. coli w has been used in research laboratories and for industrial applications for almost seventy years. because of this long history, the strain is considered a 'safe' laboratory strain. the safety of a strain is an important consideration both for laboratory research and for industrial applications. containment and handling in both environments is less complex for safe strains, and safety requirements can significantly impact on the economics of production. like other safe strains, w harbors genes which encode pathogenicity determinants. w has more such genes than other safe strains; however, many have been mutationally inactivated or are missing key components required for pathogenicity. these observations confirm the historical attribution of w as a safe strain.

amongst the four safe laboratory strains, w has several unique features: it belongs to phylogroup b <dig> rather than a; it has a larger genome size; and the period of time between isolation and strain archiving was relatively short. the two latter features are probably related: strains that are maintained under laboratory conditions for extended time periods are subject to specific selection pressures, and tend to lose genes which are not required for survival under laboratory conditions  <cit> . in line with this, and consistent with its larger genome size, the w genome encodes more genes than other safe strains. additionally, it has fewer iss, which tend to multiply in genomes of organisms maintained under laboratory conditions  <cit> . overall, w is more similar to other pathogenic and commensal strains than it is to the other safe laboratory strains. furthermore, it has the largest backbone sequence of the group b <dig> strains, suggesting that it has the most complete complement of ancestral genes. these considerations place w as the preferred laboratory strain for use in genomic comparisons aimed at investigating genes involved in pathogenicity and commensalism.

like other wild-type isolates  <cit> , w encodes a large number of carbon source utilization genes, and it grows on a much broader range of carbon substrates than k- <dig> strains . of particular interest is the ability of w to utilize sucrose as a carbon source. for industrial production applications, in particular for large-scale production of commodity biochemicals , sucrose from sugarcane is the preferred carbon source  <cit> . it is abundant, it is cheaper than glucose  <cit>  and it is also 'greener' than glucose; for example, greenhouse gas emissions for ethanol production are reduced by 85% relative to petrochemicals when using sugarcane sucrose as a carbon source, whereas use of glucose from corn reduces emissions by only 30%  <cit> . the growth of w on sucrose, in combination with its many other desirable industrial traits  also place e. coli w as a preferred strain for industrial biotechnology applications. some of these characteristics  are easily explained by genome analysis. however, the raw sequence data does not shed any light on why w exhibits the other characteristics. further experimental analysis using a systems biology approach might shed light on this.

an annotated genome sequence is an important step in characterisation of an organism, and allows construction of genome scale models which can be used to  interrogate the metabolic attributes of organisms and  facilitate strain development for industrial applications. our w gsr includes a number of genes which were not annotated in the original k- <dig> gem; this includes both genes that are unique to w and genes that were omitted from the k- <dig> model. our improved model more accurately reflects the metabolism of an e. coli cell. there is good agreement between genome data, phenome data, and model data; the combination of these allows us to define the metabolic capabilities of e. coli w both in vitro and in silico. the w strain exhibits many industrially desirable traits, including fast growth, stress tolerance, growth to high cell densities, and the ability to utilise sucrose efficiently  <cit> . with the availability of an annotated genome and gsr, the w strain can now be used as a platform organism for developing sucrose-based bioprocesses to replace current unsustainably-produced industrial chemicals.
