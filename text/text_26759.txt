BACKGROUND
macrophages  are key protagonists in both frontline defence against pathogens and regulation of the subsequent adaptive immune response. chemokines secreted by mθ during an inflammatory response are important determinants of the ensuing immune reaction, regulating the types and amounts of effector cells recruited to execute an appropriate response  <cit> . alternatively-activated mθ  <cit>  play important roles in wound healing  <cit>  and the resolution of inflammation  <cit> , as well as contributing to allergic inflammation, hence il-4-mediated signalling in mθ is critical to many important human diseases.

the receptor for thymus and activation-regulated chemokine , ccr <dig>  <cit> , is most highly expressed on differentiated th <dig> lymphocytes  <cit> , as well as cd25+ regulatory t cells  <cit>  and cla+  skin-homing lymphocytes  <cit> . thus, tarc is implicated in the recruitment of th <dig> lymphocytes and the maintenance of th <dig> immune responses  <cit> , as well as in the suppression of classically-activated mθ  <cit> . tarc expression levels correlate with the severity of disease in some chronic allergic pathologies, including asthma  <cit> , atopic dermatitis  <cit>  and cutaneous lupus erythematosus  <cit> . additionally, in vivo neutralisation of tarc can limit th <dig> lymphocyte recruitment and inflammation  <cit> , underlining the significance of this chemokine to allergic pathologies and the importance of understanding how its expression is regulated in cells of the innate immune system.

expression of the cc chemokine tarc has been shown to be up-regulated in human monocytes and mθ treated with the th <dig> cytokines, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> , and inhibited by ifn-γ  <cit> . murine tarc  shares 66% identity with human tarc at the amino acid level and is similarly chemotactic for ccr4+ cells. mtarc has been shown to be expressed by langerhans cells  <cit>  and dendritic cells   <cit> , but not by mθ treated with ifn-γ and lps  <cit> . the roles of alternatively activated mθ in the production of mtarc and the mechanisms underlying the il- <dig> induction of this chemokine in mθ have not been fully addressed.

stat <dig> is the sole stat protein capable of signal transduction from the il- <dig> receptor and activates the transcription of inflammatory mediators including eotaxin   <cit> , yml  <cit>  and 12/15-lipoxygenase  <cit> . stat <dig> also plays an integral role in the biology of alternatively-activated mθ via activation of the myeloid transcription factor, tfec  <cit>  as well as arginase i  <cit> . following ligand binding, jak  proteins associated with the il- <dig> receptor phosphorylate stat <dig> monomers, allowing them to dimerise, translocate to the nucleus and activate gene transcription by binding to palindromic ttc4gaa dna consensus sites  <cit> . the c-terminus of stat dimers contains the transactivation domain   <cit> , whereas the n-terminus may stabilise interactions between stat dimers bound at tandem low-affinity sites less than  <dig> bp apart, resulting in enhanced transcriptional responses from these promoters  <cit> .

in this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that il- <dig> is a key inducer of tarc mrna and protein in murine mθ and confirm that this induction is mediated by the transcription factor, stat <dig>  of eleven potential stat <dig> sites identified within the murine tarc  proximal promoter, we show that five of these sites contribute differentially and cooperatively to the il-4-inducibility of the tarc promoter. these studies have also enabled us to generate a potent il-4-inducible element based on the natural configuration of mtarc promoter stat <dig> sites that could be used to drive expression of specific transgenes in response to il- <dig> with potential therapeutic benefit.

RESULTS
murine tarc is up regulated by il- <dig> in macrophages
biogel-elicited peritoneal mθ were stimulated with classical thl <dig>  or th <dig>  cytokines or lps . rna and culture supernatant samples were simultaneously prepared from single wells at defined time points over a 72-hour period and were analysed for murine tarc  mrna and protein expression. cell viability over this time period was independently confirmed by mtt assay . mtarc mrna was almost completely absent from untreated cells at all time points , and was most potently induced by il- <dig>  consistent with its reported expression pattern in human mθ  <cit> . onset of mtarc induction by il- <dig> was seen at  <dig> hours and peaked at  <dig> hours, when mtarc mrna induction over untreated samples was more than  <dig> -fold. il- <dig> was also a potent inducer of mtarc mrna at this time point, as measured by semi-quantitative pcr . after  <dig> hours, there was a dramatic decline in mtarc mrna levels detected in the il-4-treated samples, although expression had still not returned to basal level within  <dig> hours. neither lps nor ifn-γ stimulated up-regulation of mtarc mrna, even though these treatments resulted in significant induction of ip- <dig>   <cit>  mrna . ifn-γ was also found to inhibit mtarc mrna induction by il- <dig> when added either prior to or concurrently with il- <dig> treatment . mtarc protein expression closely followed the mrna profile in time of onset and duration . as with the mrna, mtarc protein expression was only detected in il-4-treated samples. mtarc protein first appeared in the culture supernatants of il-4-treated cells after  <dig> hours. protein levels reached a peak at  <dig> hours, and had not declined greatly by  <dig> hours, as previously documented for human pbmcs  <cit>  and t lymphocytes  <cit> .

induction of tarc mrna by il- <dig> is mediated by stat <dig> and does not require de novo protein synthesis
the kinetics of the il- <dig> induction of tarc are such that several different mechanisms of promoter activation might be possible  <cit> , including activation of pi <dig> kinase  <cit>  or the il-4-activated transcription factor, pparγ  <cit> . however, mtarc induction by il- <dig> was not inhibited by the pi <dig> kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, or the pkc inhibitor, chelerythrine chloride  and mtarc mrna was not up regulated by the pparγ agonists, rosiglitazone, troglitazone or 15-deoxy-Δ <dig> -prostaglandin j <dig> . as stat6-mediated gene transcription does not require de novo protein synthesis  <cit> , we measured mtarc induction by il- <dig> in the presence of the translational inhibitor, cycloheximide. cells were pre-treated for  <dig> hours with doses of cycloheximide found to abrogate 35s-methionine incorporation. il- <dig> was added and cells cultured for a further  <dig> or  <dig> hours before rna harvest. mtarc mrna was still induced by il- <dig> in the presence of both cycloheximide doses at  <dig> hours and at  <dig> hours . furthermore, cycloheximide treatment resulted in mtarc superinduction, as has been noted for early immediate genes such as cox- <dig>  <cit> . these results indicate that de novo protein synthesis is not a pre-requisite of the il- <dig> induction of mtarc and may actually act to reduce mtarc transcription.

to determine the involvement of stat <dig> in mtarc regulation, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal mθ were isolated from both wild-type and stat6-/-  <cit>  mice and treated with il- <dig> for  <dig> hours . whereas the wild-type balb/c mθ exhibited the characteristic strong il- <dig> induction of mtarc mrna, the stat6-/- mθ did not, demonstrating an absolute requirement of stat <dig> for the il-4-mediated up regulation of mtarc in mθ. binding of stat <dig> to the endogenous mtarc promoter was also confirmed in chip assays using il-4-treated bone marrow-derived mθ  in the presence or absence of a stat <dig> blocking peptide. this experiment shows that stat <dig> is rapidly recruited to the mtarc promoter in il- <dig> treated mθ.

identification of putative stat <dig> binding sites in the murine tarc proximal promoter
we obtained the sequence for the mdc-fractalkine-tarc loci on mouse chromosome  <dig> from the celera and sanger centre  <cit>  databases and identified eleven putative stat <dig> binding sites  within a  <dig>  kb region 5' of the mtarc coding sequence . three of the putative mtarc stat <dig> sites  conform to the published consensus sequence for stat <dig> binding, ttc4gaa  <cit> . the t <dig> site has ttc3gaa spacing, to which stats  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  can bind, as well as stat <dig>  <cit> . the remaining seven sites represent variations of the ttc4gaa consensus, each possessing  <dig> central nucleotides flanked by the a and t residues that delineate the binding site. the t <dig> and t <dig> sites were found to be highly conserved between human and mouse, suggesting they may be of particular importance in mediating tarc induction by il- <dig> in both species.

contribution of stat <dig> sites t1-t <dig> to the il- <dig> induction of murine tarc
to analyse the relative contribution of sites t1-t <dig> to the il- <dig> induction of transcription, we initially generated a 5' deletion series of promoter constructs in which these putative stat <dig> sites were sequentially lost from a full-length - <dig> construct containing all eleven putative sites and the transcriptional start site . the nomenclature of the mtarc promoter plasmids is derived from assigning the start point of transcription of the mtarc gene as +  <dig>  <cit> . these constructs were co-transfected into the raw  <dig>  mθ cell line with a stat <dig> expression vector to ensure transcription factor expression was not rate limiting or variable between samples. when stimulated with il- <dig> for  <dig> hours, these deletion constructs demonstrated differential activation. activation of full-length - <dig> mtarc promoter was reproducibly induced at least 12-fold by il- <dig>  whereas the minimal mtarc promoter , which lacks any stat <dig> sites, was not at all il-4-responsive. deletion of dna sequences between - <dig> and - <dig>  and - <dig> and - <dig>  reduces il- <dig> induction, indicating that these two regions are important to the overall il- <dig> response of the mtarc promoter.

the stat <dig> binding capacity of each putative stat <dig> site was tested in vitro by emsa . nuclear extracts from c57bl/ <dig> biogel-elicited mθ untreated or treated with il- <dig> or ifn-γ for  <dig> hour were prepared and incubated with radiolabelled probes for each individual mtarc stat <dig> site. the probes containing the t <dig> and t <dig> stat <dig> consensus sites were capable of binding a complex of the predicted mobility for stat <dig> specifically present in extracts from il-4-treated samples . the t <dig> promiscuous stat binding site and the t <dig> imperfect consensus site were also able to bind this complex. surprisingly, the probe containing the t <dig> 'perfect' stat <dig> consensus site did not bind this complex . the t <dig> and t5-t <dig> probes bound larger complexes that were not specific to il-4-treated samples . the il-4-induced complex bound by t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> was supershifted by a stat6-specific ab, but not by a stat <dig> ab, further confirming that it contained stat <dig> . both unlabelled t <dig> and t <dig> probes added in 100-fold molar excess were able to efficiently compete the stat <dig> complex from the t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> probes. these experiments show that stat <dig> can bind to sites with ttc3gaa as well as ttc4gaa spacing in the mtarc promoter and that perfect stat <dig> consensus sequence is not the only determinant of stat <dig> binding.

the binding capacity of an oligonucleotide in vitro is not always representative of its functional activity within cells  <cit>  and so we compared the relative il-4-inducibility of individual key mtarc putative stat <dig> sites in transient transfection experiments. we generated luciferase reporter plasmids containing trimers of the t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> sites, which bound stat <dig> in emsa assays, and also of the t <dig> perfect consensus site, which did not bind stat <dig>  but has perfect consensus stat <dig> binding sequence and might contribute to the activity of sequence region - <dig> to - <dig> .

oligonucleotides consisting of three copies of the emsa sequence for each of the sites were cloned onto a heterologous promoter, the minimal emr <dig> - <dig> promoter  <cit> , in pgl <dig> basic. the emr <dig> - <dig> minimal promoter was selected for its low basal activity in mθ, lack of inducibility by il- <dig>  and absence of tata box . constructs containing sites in forward and reverse orientations were identified. when co-transfected with stat <dig> into raw  <dig>  cells , trimers of t <dig> or t <dig> in either the forward  or reverse orientations  were not induced by il- <dig> at all. in contrast, trimers of t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> were induced by il- <dig> regardless of insert orientation . the t <dig> trimer was only minimally induced by il- <dig> , whereas t <dig> and t <dig> trimers were more highly induced than the mtarc - <dig> full-length promoter construct. thus, sites equally capable of binding stat <dig> in vitro can have quite disparate capacity for activation by il- <dig> in mθ when assayed by transfection.

to resolve the contribution of individual putative stat <dig> sites to overall mtarc promoter il- <dig> inducibility, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of key sites within the context of the full-length - <dig> promoter. the t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> sites were mutated, as these sites were implicated as strong candidate functional stat <dig> by previous experiments . as the 5' ttc nucleotide triplet is highly conserved amongst both published stat <dig> sites  <cit>  and all mtarc putative sites capable of binding stat <dig> in emsa experiments, this sequence was mutated to 5' aac in order to abrogate stat <dig> binding  <cit> . mutant and wild-type sequence information was compared using the genomatix matinspector  <cit>  to confirm that mutagenesis did not create new transcription factor binding sites that could alter the il- <dig> responsiveness of the constructs . each mutant construct was co-transfected with stat <dig> into raw  <dig>  cells and stimulated with il- <dig> for  <dig> hours .

this assay confirmed that t <dig> and t <dig> are of critical importance to the il- <dig> induction of mtarc - <dig>  mutation of t <dig> resulted in complete abrogation of promoter activation by il- <dig>  whereas t <dig> mutation reduced promoter fold induction by il- <dig> from 12-fold  to 2-fold. this is consistent with results shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  but in contrast with the functional activity of the isolated t <dig> trimer in figure  <dig>  mutation of t <dig> reduced promoter il- <dig> induction by 40%, indicating, as suggested by figures  <dig> and  <dig>  that t <dig> contributes less significantly than t <dig> and t <dig> to the overall il- <dig> induction. similarly, although t <dig> bound stat <dig> in emsa and was potently activated by il- <dig> as an isolated trimer, it does not appear to have significant activity within the context of mtarc - <dig> . interestingly, mutation of either t <dig> or t <dig> significantly reduced mtarc - <dig> promoter il- <dig> induction from 12-fold to 4-fold, demonstrating that these sites do contribute to overall il- <dig> induction , even though they cannot bind or be activated by stat <dig> when isolated from the promoter. thus, the functional activity of stat <dig> sites in isolation may be distinct from their functional activity within the context of their endogenous promoter. a summary of this data is compiled in table  <dig> 

murine tarc stat <dig> sites in their natural configuration constitute potent il- <dig> response elements
we next tested whether the natural configuration of sites within the mtarc promoter could confer il- <dig> inducibility on heterologous promoters and hence act as a transferable il- <dig> response element. the emr <dig> - <dig>  and the eif4a <dig> - <dig>   <cit>  minimal promoters were selected as neither was induced by il- <dig> nor had strong basal activity when transfected into raw  <dig>  cells . to assess the significance of the distal  putative stat <dig> sites and potential cooperation between the t <dig> and t <dig> sites in enhancing mtarc induction by il- <dig>  promoter constructs covering two different regions of the mtarc proximal promoter were designed. one region from position - <dig>  to - <dig> contained the five most proximal putative stat <dig> sites and bisected the sequence containing t <dig> and t <dig>  a second region from position - <dig> to - <dig> contained nine putative stat <dig> sites and intact t5-t <dig> sequence. the t <dig> site was not included in these constructs because it had not appeared significant in the experiments shown in figure  <dig>  constructs were synthesised containing either the five  or the nine  putative stat <dig> sites on each heterologous minimal promoter in both forward and reverse orientations.

when co-transfected with stat <dig> into raw  <dig>  and stimulated with il- <dig> , these mtarc promoter elements were able to confer potent il- <dig> inducibility on both the emr <dig> and the eif-4a promoters. interestingly, only sites inserted in the forward orientation were induced by il- <dig> . the 9xst <dig> constructs gave 95-135-fold induction with il- <dig>  whereas the 5xst <dig> constructs gave only 8-25-fold induction with il- <dig>  this suggests that distal mtarc promoter sites do contribute to the overall il- <dig> response, possibly via cooperative interactions  <cit> .

to examine the potency of the most il- <dig> inducible construct, emr <dig> 9xst <dig> f, we performed dose-response experiments. the full-length mtarc - <dig> and the emr <dig> 9xst <dig> f construct were transfected into raw  <dig>  cells and treated with il- <dig> concentrations ranging from  <dig> – <dig> ng/ml. both constructs gave characteristic sigmoidal response curves that began to plateau above  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig> . the emr <dig> 9xst <dig> f construct showed greater induction by il- <dig> than mtarc - <dig> at all concentrations used above  <dig>  ng/ml, which appeared to be the lower limit of the response. importantly, the emr <dig> 9xst <dig> f construct still demonstrated a 40-fold induction with concentrations of il- <dig> as low as  <dig> ng/ml, demonstrating that mtarc promoter sequences constitute a very sensitive il- <dig> response element.

discussion
in this paper, we have shown for the first time that expression of the cc chemokine mtarc/ccl <dig> is potently and rapidly induced by il- <dig> in primary murine macrophages and that this induction does not require de novo protein synthesis. tarc expression by alternatively-activated mθ therefore represents an early component of th <dig> inflammatory responses, which is exaggerated by further tarc expression by dc  <cit>  and th <dig> t-cells  <cit> . as tarc may represent an important therapeutic target in chronic allergic pathologies  <cit> , we have analysed the mechanisms underlying its il- <dig> induction in mθ in some detail. our experiments have revealed that synergistic interactions between at least five stat <dig> sites within  <dig> kb of the mtarc transcriptional start site contribute to il- <dig> regulation.

by real-time pcr, we measured significant up-regulation of mtarc mrna within  <dig> hours of il- <dig> stimulation, suggesting that mθ expression of tarc is likely to be of considerable importance in the swift establishment of th <dig> responses in vivo. this il- <dig> induction was found to be dependent on expression of stat <dig>  a transcription factor strongly implicated in chronic th <dig> pathologies including asthma  <cit> . tarc expression correlates with disease severity in many asthma patients  <cit> ; and is one of the few chemokines found to be truly stat6-dependent  <cit> , hence the data presented here substantiate the link between tarc and stat <dig> in disease and may suggest means by which tarc expression could be modulated for therapeutic benefit. stat-mediated transcription is tightly regulated by intracellular suppressors  <cit> . the ifn-γ-mediated inhibition of mtarc expression may result from up regulation of socs <dig>  <cit> , which we found inhibited the il- <dig> induction of mtarc - <dig> in raw  <dig>  cells . socs <dig> is also up regulated by il- <dig>  <cit> , and so our observations of mtarc superinduction by il- <dig> in the presence of cycloheximide could be related to reduced expression of this factor.

induction of mtarc by il- <dig> is mediated by multiple stat <dig> sites within the proximal promoter
no de novo protein synthesis was required for the il- <dig> induction of mtarc, indicating direct interaction of stat <dig> with the mtarc promoter. this was confirmed by chip experiments revealing stat <dig> bound to the endogenous mtarc promoter in il-4-treated mθ. fulkerson et al.  <cit>  identified mtarc  as a cc chemokine induced early in the lung in an allergen challenge model of asthma and using stat <dig> deficient mice showed that mtarc expression in this disease model was stat <dig> dependent. during the preparation of this manuscript, wirnsberger et al.  <cit>  reported the involvement of two stat <dig> sites  in the il-4-mediated regulation of tarc in human t lymphocytes, but did not investigate the additional highly conserved proximal t <dig> site that we identified. the authors identified these stat <dig> sites by 'visual inspection' rather than systematic analysis using transcription factor search engines and so the data do not exclude the possibility of more distal functional stat <dig> sites that may diverge from strict consensus sequence  <cit> . we identified eleven putative stat <dig> sites within the mtarc proximal promoter and determined that five of these had functional activity within the context of the mtarc - <dig> construct. hence the regulation of mtarc by il- <dig> is more complex than previous work suggests, involving multiple stat <dig> sites. to our knowledge, such interaction between stat <dig> sites has only previously been reported for the promoter of the socs <dig> gene  <cit> .

of the five functional stat <dig> sites identified, the two sites conserved between human and mouse, t <dig> and t <dig>  were found to be important mediators of the mtarc induction by il- <dig>  even though t <dig> is not considered a classical stat <dig> binding site  <cit> . by site-directed mutagenesis, t <dig> was shown to be absolutely essential for il- <dig> induction of the mtarc promoter and mutation of t <dig> in the context of the - <dig> promoter resulted in an 85% reduction in promoter induction by il- <dig>  the significance of the t <dig> site was predicted from its perfect ttc4gaa consensus stat6-binding sequence and ability to bind and be activated by stat <dig> as an isolated site. in contrast, the t <dig> site has ttc3gaa spacing, previously associated with weak or inhibitory activity when occupied by stat <dig>  <cit> , and also could not be activated by il- <dig> as an isolated site, even though it bound stat <dig> 

three additional sites  were found to support the il- <dig> induction of mtarc to a lesser extent than t <dig> and t <dig>  even though both t <dig> and t <dig> are perfect consensus stat6-binding sites. interestingly, the t <dig> imperfect stat <dig> site was found to have equivalent function to t <dig> within the context of the mtarc - <dig> promoter and the significance of both sites did not correlate with their capacities for stat <dig> binding in emsa. thus, the findings of this paper sound a cautionary note for prediction of stat <dig> site function from sequence data alone and emphasise the importance of adopting multiple approaches for the analysis of stat6-mediated gene transcription. notably, stat <dig> has also been shown to bind to an imperfect palindrome site in the delta-opioid receptor  <cit> , suggesting that functional stat <dig> sites in other genes are also not restricted to a simple ttc4gaa consensus sequence and cannot be identified as such.

the involvement of five closely-apposed stat <dig> sites in the il- <dig> induction of mtarc suggests that overall promoter induction may result from interactions between sites. cooperation between proximal stat <dig> sites in the socs <dig> promoter has been described  <cit>  and other stat proteins have similarly been shown to interact to activate gene transcription  <cit> . this arrangement of functional sites may stabilise stat <dig> binding to low-affinity or non-canonical sites, such as t <dig>  enhancing the overall transcriptional response to il- <dig>  obligate stabilising interactions between stat <dig> dimers bound at the juxtaposed t <dig> and t <dig> sites may explain the lack of stat <dig> binding to these sites in isolation, as well as the comparable reduction in promoter induction by il- <dig> when either site was mutated.

from our analyses of the functional activity of mtarc stat <dig> sites, we were able to generate transferable promoter elements that conferred potent il- <dig> responsiveness on two heterologous promoters. constructs containing five mtarc putative stat <dig> sites and intervening promoter sequences in their endogenous arrangement  were induced up to 95-fold by il- <dig>  whereas constructs containing nine sites  were induced up to 135-fold. the significantly greater activation of the 9xst <dig> constructs containing both t <dig> and t <dig> sites than the 5xst <dig> constructs lacking t <dig> may have resulted from interactions between the t <dig> and t <dig> sites. although the 5xst <dig> constructs contained the t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> functionally significant stat <dig> sites, stimulation with il- <dig> resulted in promoter activity that was only 10–20% that of the 9xst <dig> constructs. thus, distal promoter regions play an important role in mtarc induction by il- <dig>  importantly, the potent il- <dig> inducibility of these heterologous promoter constructs suggests that mtarc-derived il- <dig> responsive elements could be used to direct il-4-inducible gene expression in vivo with potential scientific and therapeutic benefit.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have demonstrated that th <dig> cytokines regulate murine tarc by a direct-acting stat <dig> pathway. we have shown that the mtarc promoter contains multiple functional stat <dig> sites with heterogeneous capacity for binding of stat <dig> and transcriptional activation. the sites conserved between human and mouse tarc promoters are the most crucial for the il- <dig> induction of mtarc, but distal sites also play a significant role. importantly, sites with imperfect consensus sequence have been shown to be functional, suggesting that the analysis of other stat6-regulated genes may be warranted. these findings have also allowed us to develop highly responsive il-4-inducible elements, significantly more active than those generated from multimerised individual stat <dig> sites  <cit> , which could be exploited direct transgene expression in alternatively activated macrophages in vivo.
