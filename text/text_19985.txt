BACKGROUND
micrornas  include a large group of regulatory, non-coding small rnas that measure ~ <dig> nucleotides  in length  <cit> . in animal cells, mirnas are first transcribed from genes by the rna polymerase, pol ii, as primary mirnas, which are then cleaved by an rnase iii enzyme, drosha, into hairpin-like precursor mirna   <cit> . the pre-mirnas are transported into the cytoplasm with the help of a protein called exportin  <dig>  <cit>  in the cytoplasm, the pre-mirnas are cut into double stranded rna duplexes by another rnase iii enzyme, dicer  <cit> . typically, one of the strands becomes mature mirna and is incorporated into a risc complex with other components for target recognition  <cit> . the risc complex then binds to its target mrna through base pairing and carries out its functions. customarily, in the target mrnas of an animal mirna, there are multiple complementary sites, which correspond to the same mirna. this cooperative action makes inhibition more efficient  <cit> . on the other hand, one mirna usually inhibits multiple target mrnas  <cit> . this property enables mirna to regulate many genes in a pathway or physiological process at the same time. the action of mirnas includes cleavage of target mrna, translational inhibition, and mrna deadenylation  <cit> . several studies have shown that the degree of complementarity between the mirna and its target determines the mode of how a mirna works  <cit> . since the discovery of the first mirna, lin- <dig>  <cit> , much progress has been made in the elucidation of mirna mechanisms  <cit> . however, only a handful of mirnas have been studied for their precise functions. the mirnas in animals function in tissue development, cell differentiation, apoptosis, fat and lipid metabolism, exocytosis, stem cell division and differentiation, diseases and cancers  <cit> . these known functions may represent just a small part of a much bigger picture. one third of the genes in the human genome are predicted to mirna targets  <cit> . with the continuing discovery of new mirna functions, it is possible that mirnas will be associated with the regulation of almost every aspect of cell physiology.

spatial and temporal expression patterns of mirnas can provide clues for their possible functions. profile studies have already shown that many mirnas are specifically expressed in certain organs, cell types and developmental stages. in a recent study, mirna expression patterns among different pancreas cell types were compared  <cit> . one of the detected mirnas in the study was identified as a pancreas islet-specific mirna, which was later demonstrated to function in insulin secretion  <cit> .

in order to study the expression profiling of mirnas in mice and humans, several high throughput platforms have been developed. microarrays on either membranes or slides are widely used for this purpose  <cit> . various probe designs and labeling methods have also been utilized. some groups have applied these microarray methods in an effort to detect the expression profiling of mirnas in different tissues and cell types in humans and mice. real-time pcr has also been used to detect the expression of pre-mrnas and mature mirnas  <cit> .

the purpose of this study is to identify mirnas that are expressed specifically in the rat lung or co-expressed in the lung and one of the five other organs in the rat. in addition, this study aims to set up a reliable, in-house mirna microarray platform for lung research. although the expression profiling of mirnas in human and mouse organs has been detected by some groups, the expression in rat organs has not been extensively studied. furthermore, relatively little is known about the detailed functions of mirnas in the lung except lung cancers. for this study, we designed a probe set for rat mirnas as well as human and mouse mirnas that possess conservative sequences in the rat genome, based on the fact that mirnas are highly conserved in animals and in plants  <cit> . the hybridizations were performed with slides printed in our laboratory. the reliability of the microarray platform was tested before other experiments were performed. as a result, our microarray allowed us to identified lung-specific mirnas in the rat that are likely to facilitate studies of mirna functions in the lung.

RESULTS
reproducibility and specificity of the mirna microarray platform
in order to evaluate the reliability of the mirna microarray, we tested the reproducibility of the data from multiple hybridizations . first, equal amounts of enriched mirnas from each of the  <dig> organs were pooled as the common reference. then, mirna from each organ  was co-hybridized with the common reference . the maximum and minimum probe signals in the six replicates from each hybridization were excluded from data analysis. the mirna signal was then calculated as the geometric average of the remaining  <dig> probe signals. the correlation coefficient of the mirna signals of the common references  between two hybridizations was calculated in order to assess the reproducibility of the microarray hybridization. the results are shown in table  <dig>  the correlation coefficients between two hybridizations were  <dig>  –  <dig> . for comparison, we also used one spot per block for calculations, where the correlation coefficients were  <dig>  to  <dig> . the results suggest that our arrays are highly reproducible.

to test the specificity of the microarray, we used mismatched probes for two mirnas, rno-mir- <dig> and rno-mir-324-5p, which were included in the control oligos provided with the labeling kit. the probes with one, two and three nucleotide mismatches were denoted with m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  respectively. the microarray could not reliably distinguish those with only one mismatch. however, the signals from probes with two mismatches were significantly decreased, > <dig> fold less than those from probes with perfect base paring . from these results, we concluded that our microarray could differentiate between mirnas with two or more nucleotide differences.

identification of lung-specific mirna
in order to identify mirnas that are prominently expressed in the rat lung or co-expressed in the lung and another organ, mirna samples from  <dig> organs of  <dig> rats were co-hybridized with the common reference. a dye flip was subsequently performed. after scanning the slides, spots qualities were evaluated using the realspot software  <cit> . any mirnas with average qi's no larger than  <dig> in any of the six organs were eliminated from data analysis. out of  <dig> mirnas, only  <dig> passed the realspot quality test. the qualified mirna signals were then tested by significant analysis of microarray  to eliminate mirnas that did not have significant changes between any of the six organs  <cit> . after the sam test, another  <dig> mirnas were eliminated, leaving  <dig> mirnas for further study. any mirnas that were prominent in one organ or co-expressed in two organs were identified by tukey honestly significant difference  analysis  . two mirnas  were identified as being expressed specifically in the rat lung. there are  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotide differences between mir-200c, and mir-200a and mir-200b, respectively. therefore, our arrays were able to detect the difference between the isoforms. the numbers of the prominently expressed mirnas in the heart, brain, liver, kidney and spleen were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the numbers of co-expressed mirnas are shown on the lines between the two organs in figure  <dig>  the lung had more mirnas co-expressed in the heart than with any other organ. this finding is likely due to the relationship between the lung and the heart in organogenesis.

after hsd analysis, we calculated the organ specificity index  for organ-mirnas that passed the sam test. there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas prominently expressed in the lung, heart, brain, liver, kidney and spleen, respectively using osi > <dig>  as a criterion . we also noted organ specificity if the mirna expression in one organ was at least two fold of that in all other organs. according to this two-fold definition, similar results were obtained , showing the number of mirnas exclusively expressed in only one of the  <dig> organs to be  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

confirmation by northern blot
to further investigate the reliability of our microarray data,  <dig> mirnas were selected for northern blot confirmation . total rna was extracted from the lung, heart, brain, liver, kidney and spleen from  <dig> rats. these were the same tissues from the rats utilized for small rna extraction for the microarray experiment. total rna samples from the respective organs were pooled for the experiment. the intensities of the blots were normalized to u <dig> snrna and the normalized intensities from northern blots were compared with those from the arrays . among the  <dig> selected mirnas, two were lung-specific , one was kidney-specific , and three were co-expressed in the lung and heart  as determined by hsd, osi and two-fold criteria. most mirnas had similar expression patterns from microarray analysis and northern blots . in a few cases, the northern blot showed a higher expression in comparison with the microarray, including mirna- <dig> in heart and mirna- <dig> in kidney and spleen. we also selected additional mirnas for verification:  <dig> mirnas that had high expression in the lung and/or heart  and  <dig> mirnas that were expressed in most of the  <dig> organs . again, the results exhibited the consistency of the expression patterns between the mirna array and northern blot analysis. the correlation coefficients of  <dig> mirnas between microarray and northern blot were higher than  <dig> . although there were few discrepancies, it is clear that the microarray data agreed with the northern blot data.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we designed a mirna microarray system in our laboratory and tested its reliability. this method was used to compare the mirna expression patterns of six different rat organs, namely the lung, heart, brain, liver, kidney and spleen. we identified  <dig> mirnas  that were distinctively expressed in the rat lung,  <dig> mirnas that were co-expressed in the lung and heart and  <dig> mirna that was co-expressed in the lung and kidney. the reliability of our microarray was confirmed by the high consistence between the microarray and northern blot analysis.

several groups have developed mirna microarray platforms to detect the profiling of mirnas. however, our platform has several unique features. first, we used two-channel co-hybridization. we also pooled all of the samples as the common reference. additionally, we performed the dye swap to eliminate the effect of dye bias. the approaches are similar to those used in dna microarrays. conversely, most of the other platforms use a single channel platform. some groups have utilized synthesized oligos as the common reference in their microarrays  <cit> , but the dna-rna hybridization may differ from dna-dna hybridization. second, we have  <dig> replicate spots in our microarray, making us able to exclude the maximum and minimum values while being able to calculate the geometric average signal from the remaining  <dig> replicates. this method significantly increased the reproducibility of the data. third, we printed slides in-house with  <dig> identical blocks in each slide. this procedure allowed us to hybridize  <dig> samples  on a single slide. we have previously demonstrated that this approach significantly reduces the variance and increases the efficiency  <cit> .

when comparing our data with previous studies, there are similarities as well as differences. for example, only one of the mirnas we identified as lung-specific, mir-200c, has been reported by other groups  <cit> . also, mir- <dig> was previously reported to be expressed higher in the spleen than in the lung  <cit> , but both our microarray and northern blot results show rno-mir- <dig> expressing much higher in the lung than in the spleen. a few factors could have lead to these discrepancies. first, the mirnas printed on our microarray slides were different from others. some platforms did not contain all of the  <dig> mirnas that we printed on our slides. for example, mmu-mir- <dig> is a newly identified mirna expressed highly in the lung. this particular mirna was not included on microarray slides in the other studies. therefore, our study is supplemental and concurrent with other mirna profiling studies. second, the sample origins, hybridization conditions, and data analysis methods were different among different research groups. our mirna samples were extracted from rat organs and those of other groups were extracted from human and mouse organs. although this may cause some differences, most mirnas identified thus far are conserved among species. the use of different hybridization conditions and normalization methods may have also caused some inconsistencies in sensitivity and specificity. however, the methods and conditions used in our study are highly reproducible. third, some mirnas that were lung-specific were not highly expressed. this may have caused a disagreement with other microarray platforms. indeed, when we compared the highly expressed mirnas that we found in the rat brain to those identified by other groups,  <dig> out of  <dig> were consistent with others  <cit> , suggesting that our results are reliable and comparable to other mirna microarray platforms.

there are some differences between the results from the microarray and the northern blots. the most obvious reason for the variation was that the hybridization conditions and the normalization methods were different between the two. the hybridization temperatures and buffer affected the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. the assumption for the microarray normalization was that the total amount of mirna was consistent between samples from different organs. realistically, this assumption was not true in some cases. the signals from the northern blots were normalized to the signals of u <dig> snrna with the assumption that the amount of u <dig> snrna was the same as the amount of total rna from the different organs. it is virtually impossible to provide the exact same amount of rna between samples.

among the  <dig> mirnas confirmed by the northern blots, none has a known function except mmu-mir- <dig>  <cit> . the expression of mmu-mir- <dig> was reported to be limited to the pancreatic β cells, although we also detected it in the rat lung. it has been reported to regulate the secretion of insulin. neither the secondary signals nor the actin filament network are affected by mmu-mir- <dig>  mtpn was validated as a target gene of mmu-mir- <dig>  mtpn was reported to form a complex with capz which regulates actin polymerization  <cit> . in the lung, the alveolar epithelial type ii cells secrete surfactant through exocytosis, which helps to reduce the surface tension of the alveolar sacs and facilitate the normal function of gas exchange. the mechanism of the secretion of surfactant in the lung is similar to that of the secretion of insulin in the pancreas. we suspect that mmu-mir- <dig> works in both of these exocytosis processes. we may find some hints as to the mechanism of exocytosis in the lung if we find more targets of mir- <dig> or any of the components that interact with these targets.

two well-known mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  have highly specific expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue  <cit> . in our study, we also identified these mirnas as having heart-specific expression. these two mirnas are clustered together in the mouse genome and both of them modulate muscle proliferation and differentiation. mir- <dig> promotes myogenesis by targeting histone deacetylase  <dig> , while mir- <dig> promotes myoblast proliferation by inhibiting serum response factor   <cit> .

a brain-specific mirna, mir- <dig>  has been identified by our microarray as well as by microarrays from other groups. it has been shown to affect neural lineage differentiation in es cells. stat <dig>  which is a member of the signal transducer and activator of transcription family, is believed to be involved in this function  <cit> . in presenilin- <dig> null mice, mir- <dig> has been shown to be down-regulated, leading to severe brain developmental defects  <cit> .

the liver-specific mirna, mir- <dig>  likely modulates the hepatitis c virus by facilitating replication of the viral rna. mutational analysis and ectopic expression studies have revealed that mir- <dig> interacts with the 5' non-coding region of the viral genome  <cit> . this suggests that mir- <dig> may be a target for antiviral interaction  <cit> . in addition, mir- <dig> is a key regulator of cholesterol and fatty-acid metabolism in the adult liver by regulating plasma cholesterol levels, fatty-acid oxidation, hepatic fatty-acid synthesis as well as cholesterol synthesis  <cit> .

among the spleen-specific mirnas identified, five of them belong to the mir <dig> mirna cluster, which comprise mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-19a, mir-19b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-106a, and mir-106b  <cit> . among these  <dig> mirnas, mir-17-5p, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> belong to one of the mir <dig> microrna clusters, the mir-17– <dig> cistron, which is one with well characterized cancer association. the mir-17– <dig> polycistron is located at 13q <dig>  a genomic locus that is often amplified in cancers. the substantial increase in the expression of micrornas from this cistron has been reported in human b-cell lymphomas and human lung cancers  <cit> . however, the prominent expression and function of these mirnas in the spleen are not known.

there are few studies concerning the functions of mirnas in the lung. several recent studies have given rise to a great interest in this field of research. the reduction in the expression of let- <dig> in human lung cancers is correlated to increased death rates in patients  <cit> . experimentally, over-expression of let- <dig> can inhibit lung cancer cell growth in vitro. this discovery shows that let- <dig> may have potential clinical value in treating lung cancers. inactivation of dicer results in the defect of epithelial branching  <cit> . this defect is independent of the requirement for dicer in cell survival and does not stop the epithelial growth  <cit> . in the e <dig>  lung, ago <dig> and ago <dig> are enriched in the branching regions, which undergo the most dynamic changes during lung remodeling. this discovery suggests that mirnas regulate processes responsible for the biogenesis of the lung  <cit> . another study shows that the decrease in dicer expression is associated with the poor prognosis in lung cancer patients  <cit> . the mirna expression profiles in lung cancers correlate with the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients  <cit> .

in summary, we designed a reliable mirna microarray platform that is low in cost and easy to update with highly reproducible results. the expression profiling of micrornas in  <dig> rat organs was detected with this platform. the expression patterns of lung-specific and lung co-expressed micrornas were confirmed by northern blot analysis. our platform adds to the implementation of detecting microrna profiles, as no other microarray platform has been made for the detection of rat microrna profiles. furthermore, our microarray platform contains several recently discovered mirnas, making it supplementary to other platforms. when applied, our study of the expression patterns of mirnas in the lung should shed light on the functions of mirnas in lung physiology as well as lung pathophysiology.
