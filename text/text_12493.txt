BACKGROUND
to date phenolic/non-phenolic compounds and some toxic environmental pollutants particularly textile waste water effluents posing serious health hazards to the entire living ecosystem and especially on the animals and humans. over the past several years, there has been great interest among researchers in the production of ligninolytic- and cellulose-degrading enzymes from various agro-industrial waste materials and their by-products, such as wheat straw, rice husk, banana waste, citrus peel, rice straw, corncobs, corn stover, apple pomace, and sugar cane bagasse  <cit> . these wastes are not properly disposed off in developing countries and have become a major source of ecological pollution. significant efforts have been made to convert lignocellulosic residues to valuable products such as bio-fuels, chemicals and animal feed with the help of ligninolytic enzymes of wrf, many of which have been successful  <cit> . to degrade all the components of lignocellulosic materials and phenolic organic substrates, white rot fungi  are so far exclusive in their strong oxidative capabilities due to their extracellular nonspecific enzyme system  <cit> .

wrf produce two major families of enzymes, generally termed ligninolytic enzymes, i.e., extracellular peroxidases  and phenol oxidases . mnp and laccases have been applied frequently in various bio-technological processes such as lignocellulosic biomass delignification for ethanol production, oxidation of pollutants, bioremediation processes, textile bio-finishing, beverage processing, bio-bleaching of pulps and detergent manufacturing  <cit> . mnps are heme-containing glycoproteins having capability to catalyze the oxidation of mn2+ to mn3+. the mn3+−organic acid complexes, in turn, oxidize phenolic structures present in lignin and also various lignin related organic compounds  <cit> . in nature, mnp catalyzes plant lignin de-polymerization as component of ligninolytic enzymes complex. a wide range of substrate oxidizing capability renders it an interesting enzyme for biotechnological applications in several industries.

textile waste effluents contain several types of chemicals including real dyes itself that are toxic, carcinogenic or mutagenic. textile industries discharged their waste effluents into water streams with or without some partial treatments which mainly causes water pollution and also dangerous for aquatic life. in literature, various physical/chemical methods have been reported by several authors to effectively process the textile effluents such as adsorption, precipitation, chemical reduction, ionizing radiations and ultra filtration  <cit> . in spite of the existing physical/chemical technologies for colour removal which are usually expensive and commercially/environmentally unattractive, biological processes provide an alternative to existing physico−chemical technologies because they are cost effective, eco−friendly and can be applied to wide range of dye containing industrial effluents  <cit> .

enzyme immobilization offers a noteworthy solution to industrial and environmental challenges faced by the modern world predominantly in the applications of enzymes in agro-waste management, textile effluents decolorization, and alternatives of health hazardous chemical based procedures. to date, various techniques have been reported for enhancing activity and operational stability of industrial enzymes. gel entrapment is preferred over other immobilization techniques as this method is convenient and the structure of the enzyme remains secure. recently, sol−gels have attracted the attention of biotechnologists due to their ability to produce enzymes in defined thin films that are thermo-stable and non-toxic in nature  <cit> . among the various potent lignin-degrading microorganisms, g. lucidum is a potential mnp producer with high catalytic potentials that are suitable for a wide range of environmental/biotechnological applications. therefore, in the current study mnp from g. lucidum was immobilized using sol–gel matrix entrapment technique. the decolorization of different textile effluents by the sol–gel matrix entrapped mnp was also the main focus of the present study to present its approach for bioremediation applications.

RESULTS
production, purification and immobilization of mnp
a large magnitude of an indigenous mnp  was obtained from white rot fungal strain g. lucidum in solid state bio-processing of wheat straw under optimized fermentation conditions . active mnp fraction was  <dig> -fold purified by sephadex g- <dig> gel filtration chromatographic technique with an overall yield and specific activity of  <dig> % and  <dig>  u/mg, respectively . native and sds-page was used to confirm the purity of mnp at homogeneity level corresponding to its single peaked band of  <dig> kda . the purified mnp was immobilized using sol–gel matrix entrapment technique with  <dig> % immobilization efficiency using the fraction containing  <dig> mg/ml mnp. previously, the purification protocols involving sephadex-g- <dig> gel filtration technique for the purification of various fungal enzymes, including cellulases, protease, laccase, mnp and lip from different microbial cultures have been developed  <cit> . in addition, the results obtained by the sol–gel entrapment for the present mnp immobilization are superior to those reported for covalent binding of the enzyme on siliceous cellular foams, sepa beads and amine-terminated magnetic nano−composite by glutaraldehyde cross linking method  <cit> . however, the reported covalent binding strategies involving a coupling reagent such as glutaraldehyde are much more expensive as compare to the sol–gel matrix entrapment method.

reusability and shelf life
figure  <dig> illustrated that the sol–gel entrapped mnp retained up to  <dig> % of initial activity after  <dig> periodic oxidation cycles of mnso <dig>  the effect of storage on the activity of free and entrapped mnp was determined by incubating at room temperature  for up to  <dig> days. sol–gel entrapped mnp was more stable  than that of the free mnp at room temperature . in comparison to the present study, previously yinghui et al.  <cit>  reported a residual activity of 60% only after  <dig> repeated batches for the covalently immobilized laccase while in another study, xiao et al.  <cit>  reported a residual activity of 80% after five consecutive batches. kunamneni et al.  <cit>  observed that the storage stability of m. thermophila laccase immobilized on sepabeads ec-ep <dig> carriers was 5% higher as compare to that of the free laccase.

decolorization of textile effluents by immobilized mnp
after  <dig> h reaction time under continuous shaking batch, the sol–gel- immobilized mnp was found to maximally decolorize the crescent textile effluent   followed by magna textile effluent  , arzoo textile effluent  , and chenab textile effluent  . an increase in the effluent decolorization was observed with an increase in reaction time and maximum was found after  <dig> h reaction time in a temperature controlled batch culture shaking environment. wrf grown in synthetic textile dye solutions and industrial effluents take more time to decolorize dyes, compared to isolated enzymes, because of the necessary lag phase before they grow and secrete ligninolytic enzymes for dye degradation. recently, in another effluent decolorization study, we have noted a significant time reduction and effluent colour loss  in  <dig> h by the addition of mnso <dig>  followed by abts and varatryl alcohol as mediators for mnp, laccase and lip respectively  <cit> . the variation in effluent composition is also responsible for variation in its decolorization by enzyme extracts from different fungi  <cit> .

toxicity studies
nitro-amines and formaldehyde
traces of nitro-amines were found in the maximally decolorized treated sample, indicating that nitro-amines were produced as intermediates during effluent decolorization. the formaldehyde content was  <dig>  mg/l for untreated effluent and it reduced to  <dig>  mg/l after treating with the enzyme. significantly lower quantities of nitro-amines and formaldehyde in the treated effluents suggest their formation as intermediates in the mechanism of degradation of dyes and other chemical compounds present in the effluent that were ultimately completely degraded by immobilized mnp. the ligninolytic enzymes enhance the aerobic degradation/ mineralization of dyes and pollutants that does not result in the formation of aromatic ammines  <cit> . the results of the toxicity studies showed that the effluents were not only decolorized but also detoxified by the action of immobilized mnp.

CONCLUSIONS
g. lucidum mnp was immobilized by entrapping in a sol–gel matrix with an objective to enhance its functionalities. the mnp was successfully entrapped into a sol–gel matrix of tmos and ptms with maximum of  <dig> % immobilization efficiency. the sol–gel entrapped mnp presented potential efficiency as bio-catalyst for decolorization of dye containing textile effluents and it was eco-friendly, chemical free and energy saving approach for bio-remediation on textile industry effluents.
