BACKGROUND
with the development of dna microarray technology, the biology researchers can analyze the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. many studies have demonstrated that microarray data are useful for classification of many cancers. however, from the biological perspective, only a small subset of genes is strongly indicative of a targeted disease, and most genes are irrelevant to cancer classification. the irrelevant genes may introduce noise and decrease classification accuracy. moreover, from the machine learning perspective, too many genes may lead to overfitting and can negatively influence the classification performance. due to the significance of these problems, effective gene selection methods are desirable to help to classify different cancer types and improve prediction accuracy.

in recent years, various approaches have been developed for gene selection of microarray data. generally, they are divided into three categories: filter, wrapper and embedded methods. filter methods evaluate a gene based on discriminative power without considering its correlations with other genes  <cit> . the drawback of filter methods is that it examines each gene independently, ignoring the possibility that groups of genes may have a combined effect which is not necessarily reflected by the individual performance of genes in the group. this is a common issue with statistical methods such as t-test, which examine each gene in isolation.

wrapper methods utilize a particular learning method as feature evaluation measurement to select the gene subsets in terms of the estimated classification errors and build the final classifier. wrapper approaches can obtain a small subset of relevant genes and can significantly improve classification accuracy  <cit> . for example, guyon et al.  <cit>  proposed a gene selection approach utilizing support vector machines  based on recursive feature elimination. however, the wrapper methods greatly require extensive computational time.

the third group of gene selection procedures is embedded methods, which perform the variable selection as part of the statistical learning procedure. they are much more efficient computationally than wrapper methods with similar performance. embedded methods have drawn much attention recently in the literature. the embedded methods are less computationally expensive and less prone to over fitting than the wrapper methods  <cit> .

regularization methods are an important embedded technique and perform both continuous shrinkage and automatic gene selection simultaneously. recently, there is growing interest in applying the regularization techniques in the logistic regression models. logistic regression is a powerful discriminative method and has a direct probabilistic interpretation which can obtain probabilities of classification apart from the class label information. in order to extract key features in classification problems, a series of regularized logistic regression methods have been proposed. for example, shevade and keerthi  <cit>  proposed the sparse logistic regression based on the lasso regularization  <cit>  and gauss-seidel methods. glmnet is the general approach for the l <dig> type regularized  linear model using a coordinate descent algorithm  <cit> . similar to sparse logistic regression with the l <dig> regularization method, gavin c. c. and nicola l. c.  <cit>  investigated sparse logistic regression with bayesian regularization. inspired by the aforementioned methods, we investigate the sparse logistic regression model with a l1/ <dig> penalty, in particular for gene selection in cancer classification. the l1/ <dig> penalty can be taken as a representative of lq  penalty and has demonstrated many attractive properties, such as unbiasedness, sparsity and oracle properties  <cit> .

in this paper, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm to the l1/ <dig> regularization in the sparse logistic regression framework. the approach is applicable to biological data with high dimensions and low sample sizes. empirical comparisons with sparse logistic regressions with the l <dig> penalty and the elastic net penalty demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed l1/ <dig> penalized logistic regression for gene selection in cancer classification problems.

methods
sparse logistic regression with the l1/ <dig> penalty
in this paper, we focus on a general binary classification problem. suppose we have n samples, d = {, , …, }, where xi =  is ith input pattern with dimensionality p and yi is a corresponding variable that takes a value of  <dig> or 1; yi=  <dig> indicates the ith sample in class  <dig> and yi=  <dig> indicates the ith sample is in class  <dig>  the vector xi contains p features  for the ith sample and xij denotes the value of gene j for the ith sample. define a classifier f = ex / such that for any input x with class label y, f predicts y correctly. the logistic regression is expressed as:

  pyi=1|xi=fx′iβ=expx′iβ1+expx′iβ 

where β =  are the coefficients to be estimated, note that β <dig> is the intercept. the log-likelihood is:

  lβ|d=-∑i=1nyilogfx′iβ+1-yilog1-fx′iβ 

we can obtain β by minimizing the log-likelihood . in high dimensional application with p >>n, directly solving the logistic model  is ill-posed and may lead to overfitting. therefore, the regularization approaches are applied to address the overfitting problem. when adding a regularization term to , the sparse logistic regression can be modelled as:

  β=argminlβ|d+λ∑j=1ppβj 

where λ >  <dig> is a tuning parameter and p is a regularization term. the popular regularization technique is lasso   <cit> , which has the regularization term p = ∑ |β|. many l <dig> type regularization terms have been proposed in the recent years, such as scad  <cit> , elastic net  <cit> , and mc+  <cit> .

theoretically, the lq type regularization p = ∑ |β|q with the lower value of q would lead to better solutions with more sparsity. however when q is very close to zero, difficulties with convergence arise. therefore, xu et al.  <cit>  further explored the properties of lq  regularization and revealed the extreme importance and special role of the l1/ <dig> regularization. they proposed that when 1/2<q < <dig>  the l1/ <dig> regularization can yield most sparse results and its difficulty with convergence is not very high compared with that of the l <dig> regularization, while when 0<q <1/ <dig>  the performance of lq penalties makes no significant difference and solving the l1/ <dig> regularization is much simpler than solving the l <dig> regularization. hence, the l1/ <dig> regularization can be taken as a representative of lq  regularizations. in this paper, we apply the l1/ <dig> penalty to the logistic regression model. the sparse logistic regression model based on the l1/ <dig> penalty has the form:

  β1/2=argminlβ|d+λ∑j=1pβj1/ <dig> 

the l1/ <dig> regularization has been demonstrated many attractive properties, such as unbiasedness, sparsity and oracle properties. the theoretical and experimental analyses show that the l1/ <dig> regularization is a competitive approach. our work in this paper also reveals the effectiveness of the l1/ <dig> regularization to solve the nonlinear logistic regression problems with a small number of predictive features .

a coordinate descent algorithm for the l1/ <dig> penalized logistic regression
the coordinate descent algorithm  <cit>  is a “one-at-a-time” approach, and its basic procedure can be described as follows: for each coefficients, to partially optimize the target function with respect to βj with the remaining elements of β fixed at their most recently updated values.

before introducing the coordinate descent algorithm for the nonlinear logistic regularization, we first consider a linear regularization case. suppose the dataset d has n samples, d = {, , …, }, where xi =  is ith input variables with dimensionality p and yi is the corresponding response variable. the variables are standardized: ∑i=1nxij2= <dig> and ∑i=1nyi= <dig>  therefore, the linear regression with the regularization term can be expressed as:

  rβ=argmin1n∑i=1nyi-x′β2+λ∑j=1ppβj 

where p is the regularization term. the coordinate descent algorithm solves βj and other βk ≠ j  are fixed. the equation  can be rewritten as:

  rβ=argmin1nyi-∑k≠jxikβk+xijβj2+λ∑k≠jpβk+λpβj 

the first order derivative at βj can be estimated as:

  ∂r∂βj=∑i=1n-xijyi-∑k≠jxikβk-xijβj+λpβj'= <dig> 

define y˜ij=∑k≠jxikβk as the partial residual for fitting βj and ωj=∑i=1nxijyi-y˜ij, the univariate soft thresholding operator of the coordinate descent algorithm  <cit>  for the l <dig> regularization  can be defined as:

  βj=sωj,λ=ωj+λifωj<-λωj-λifωj>λ0ifωj<λ 

similarly, for the l <dig> regularization, the thresholding operator of the coordinate descent algorithm can be defined as:

  βj=hardωj,λ=ωiωj>λ 

where i is the indicator function. this formula is equivalent to the hard thresholding operator  <cit> .

according to equations  and , we can know that the different penalties are associated with different thresholding operators. therefore, xu et al.  <cit>  proposed a half thresholding operator to solve the l1/ <dig> regularization for linear regression model. it is an iterative algorithm and can be seen as multivariate half thresholding approach. in this paper, we propose the univariate half thresholding operator of the coordinate descent algorithm for the l1/ <dig> regularization. based on equation , the gradient of the l1/ <dig> regularization at βj can be expressed as:

  ∂r∂βj=βj-ωj+λsignβj4βj= <dig> 

firstly, we consider the βj >  <dig> statement, and let, βj=μ, βj = μ <dig>  when βj >  <dig>  the equation  can be redefined as:

  μ3-ωjμ+λ4= <dig> 

there are three cases of ωj <  <dig>  0<ωj<34λ <dig>  and ωj>34λ <dig> respectively.

 if ωj <  <dig>  the three roots of equation  can be expressed as follows:

 μ1=-2rsinφ <dig> μ2=rsinφ3+i3rcosφ3andμ3=rsinφ3-i3rcosφ <dig>  

where r=ωj <dig>  φ=arccosλ8r <dig>  when r >  <dig>  none of the roots satisfices μ <dig> >  <dig>  thus, there is no solution to equation  when ωj <  <dig> 

 if 0<ωj<34λ <dig>  the three roots of equation  are:

 μ1=-2rcosφ <dig> μ2=rcosφ3+i3rsinφ <dig> 

 and μ3=rcosφ3-i3rsinφ <dig> 

there is still no solution to equation  in this case.

 if ωj>34λ <dig>  the three roots of equation  are given by:

 ·μ1=-2rcosφ <dig> ·μ2=2rcosπ-φ3andμ3=2rcosπ+φ <dig>  

in this case, the μ <dig> is a unique solution of equation . thus, the equation  has non-zero roots only when ωj>34λ <dig>  the unique solution of equation  is as follow:

 βj=μ22=23ωj1+cos2π-φωj <dig> 

on the other hand, in the βj <  <dig> statement, we denoted βj=μ and βj = - μ <dig>  the equation  can be transformed into the equation:

  μ3-ωjμ-λ4= <dig> 

the equation  also has a unique solution when ωj<-34λ23:

 μ2=2rcosπ-φ <dig> 

 and βj=-μ22=-23ωj1+cos2π-φωj <dig> 

in conclusion, the univariate half thresholding operator can be expressed as:

  βj=halfωj,λ=23ωj1+cos2π-φλωj3ifωj>34λ230otherwise 

where φλ satisfies:

 cosφλω=λ8ω3- <dig> 

the coordinate descent algorithm for the l1/ <dig> regularization makes repeated use of the univariate half thresholding operator. the details of the algorithm will be described later. this coordinate descent algorithm for the regularization can be extended to the sparse logistic regression model. based on the objective function  of the sparse logistic regression, one-term taylor series expansion for l has the form of

  lβ,λ≈12n∑i=1nzi-xiβ'wizi-xiβ+∑j=1ppβj 

where zi=xiβ˜+yi-fxiβ˜fxiβ˜1-fxiβ˜ is an estimated response, wi=fxiβ˜1-fxiβ˜ is a weight and fxiβ˜=expxiβ˜/1+expxiβ˜ is a evaluated value at current parameters. redefine the partial residual for fitting current β˜j as z˜ij=∑i=1nwiz˜i-∑k≠jxikβ˜k and ∑i=1nxijzi-z˜ij, we can directly apply the coordinate descent algorithm with the l1/ <dig> penalty for sparse logistic regression and the details are given follows:

algorithm: the coordinate descent algorithm for sparse logistic with the l1/ <dig> penalty  

the coordinate descent algorithm for the l1/ <dig> penalized logistic regression works well in the sparsity problems, because the procedure does not need to change many irrelevant parameters and recalculate partial residuals for each update step.

RESULTS
analyses of simulated data
in this section, we evaluate the performance of the sparse logistic regression with the l1/ <dig> penalty in simulation study. we generate high-dimensional and low sample size data which contain many irrelevant features. two methods are compared with our proposed approach: sparse logistic regression with the elastic net penalty  and sparse logistic regression with the lasso penalty .

we generated the vectors γi <dig> γi <dig> …,γip  independently from the standard normal distribution and the predictor vector is generated by xij=γij1-ρ+γi0ρ , where ρ is the correlation coefficient of the predictor vectors  <cit> . the simulated data set generated from the logistic model:

  logyi1-yi=β0+∑j=1pxijβj+σ·ϵ 

where ϵ is the independent random error generated from n and σ is the parameter which controls the signal to noise. in every simulation, the dimension p of the predictor vector is  <dig>  and the first five true coefficients are nonzero: β <dig> =  <dig>  β <dig> =  <dig>  β <dig> = - <dig>  β <dig> = - <dig>  β <dig> =  <dig>  and βj =  <dig> 

the estimation of the optimal tuning parameter λ in the sparse logistic regression models can be done in many ways and is often done by k-fold cross-validation . note that the choice of k will depend on the size of the training set. in our experiments, we use 10-fold cross-validation . the elastic net method has two tuning parameters, we need to cross-validate on a two-dimensional surface  <cit> .

we consider the cases with the training sample size n =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  the correlation coefficient ρ = <dig> ,  <dig>  and the noise control parameter σ = <dig> ,  <dig>  respectively. each classifier was evaluated on a test data set including  <dig> samples. the experiments were repeated  <dig> times and we report the average test errors in table  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  when the sample size n increases, the prediction performances of all the three methods are improved. for example when ρ = <dig> , and σ = <dig> , the average test errors of the l1/ <dig> method are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % with the sample sizes n= <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively. when the correlation parameter ρ and the noise parameter σ increase, the prediction performances of all the three methods are decreased. for example, when ρ = <dig>  and n = <dig>  the average test errors from the l1/ <dig> method increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, in which σ increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> . when σ = <dig>  and n = <dig>  the average test error from the l1/ <dig> method increase from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, in which ρ increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> . moreover, in our simulation, the influence of the noise may be larger than that of the variable correlation for the prediction performance of all the three methods. on the other hand, at the same parameter setting case, the prediction performance of the l1/ <dig> method is consistent and better than the results of the len and l <dig> methods. for example, whenρ = <dig> , σ = <dig>  and n= <dig>  the predictive error of the l1/ <dig> method is  <dig> % much better than  <dig> % and  <dig> % got by the len and l <dig> methods respectively.

table  <dig> shows the average number of the variables selected in  <dig> runs for each method. since the simulation datasets have x1-x <dig> relevant features, the idealized average number of variables selected by each method is  <dig>  in table  <dig>  the results obtained by the l1/ <dig> penalized method are obviously closed to  <dig> and 3– <dig> times smaller than those of the len and l <dig> penalties at the same parameter setting. for example, when ρ = <dig> , σ = <dig>  and n= <dig>  the average numbers from the len and l <dig> methods are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, and the result of l1/ <dig> method is  <dig> . moreover, when the sample size n, the correlation parameter ρ, and the noise parameter σ increase, the average numbers from all the three methods increase, but the values of the len and l <dig> methods increase faster than those of the l1/ <dig> method. this means that the l1/ <dig> penalized method consistently outperforms than other two methods in term of variable selection.

to further evaluate the performance of the l1/ <dig> penalized method, we report the frequency with which each relevant variable was selected among  <dig> runs for each method in table  <dig>  when the sample size is small , the l1/ <dig> penalty selects the relevant variables slightly less frequently than the other two methods and all the three methods select true nonzero coefficients with difficulties, especially when ρ and σ are relatively large. for example, when ρ = <dig> , σ = <dig> , n= <dig>  and for β <dig>  the selected frequencies of the l1/ <dig>  len and l <dig> methods are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively in  <dig> runs. as n increases, all the three methods tend to select the true nonzero coefficients more accurately and the l1/ <dig> penalty method performs slightly better, in terms of variable frequencies, than the other two methods under the different parameter settings of ρ and σ. to sum up, tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clearly show that the l1/ <dig> method is winner among the competitors in terms of both prediction accuracy and variable selection in the different variable correlation and noise situations.

analyses on microarray data
in this section, we compare our proposed l1/ <dig> penalized method with the len and l <dig> methods on  <dig> publicly available gene expression datasets: leukaemia, prostate, colon and dlbcl. a brief description of these datasets is given below and summarized in table  <dig> 

leukaemia dataset
the original dataset was provided by golub et al.  <cit> , and contains the expression profiles of  <dig>  genes for  <dig> patients of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  and  <dig> patients of acute myeloid leukaemia . for data preprocessing, we followed the protocol detailed in the supplementary information to dudoit et al.  <cit> . after thresholding, filtering, applying a logarithmic transformation and standardizing each expression profile to zero mean and unit variance, a dataset comprising  <dig>  genes remained.

prostate dataset
this original dataset contains the expression profiles of  <dig>  genes for  <dig> normal tissues and  <dig> prostate tumor tissues. for data preprocessing, we adopt the pretreatment method  <cit>  to obtain a dataset with  <dig> samples. and each sample contains  <dig> genes.

colon dataset
the colon microarray data set in alon et al.  <cit>  has  <dig> genes per sample and  <dig> samples which consist of  <dig> normal tissues and  <dig> cancer tissues. the colon dataset are available at http://microarray.princeton.edu/oncology.

dlbcl dataset
this dataset contains  <dig> microarray gene expression profiles of the  <dig> most prevalent adult lymphoid malignancies:  <dig> samples of diffuse large b-cell lymphomas  and  <dig> observations of follicular lymphoma . each sample contains  <dig>  gene expression values. more information on these data can be found in shipp ma et al.  <cit> . for data preprocessing, we followed the protocol detailed in the supplementary information to dudoit et al.  <cit> , and a dataset comprising  <dig>  genes remained.

we evaluate the prediction accuracy of the three penalized logistic regression models using random partition. this means that we divide the datasets at random such that approximate 70-80% of the datasets becomes training samples and the other 20-30% test samples. more information on these data is given in table  <dig>  for selecting the tuning parameter λ, we employ the ten-fold cross validation scheme using the training set. we repeat this procedure  <dig> times and the averaged misclassification errors were reported in table  <dig>  here the denominators of the ten-fold cross validation errors and the test errors describe the sample size of training and test datasets respectively. the fractions of the ten-fold cross validation errors and the test errors and the number of gene selected are the approximated integers of the corresponding average number at  <dig> runs. as shown in table  <dig>  for leukaemia dataset, the classifier with the l1/ <dig> penalty gives the average ten-fold cross validation error of 2/ <dig> and the average test error of 1/ <dig> with about  <dig> genes selected. the classifiers with len and l <dig> methods give the average ten-fold cross validation errors of 1/ <dig> and the average test errors of 1/ <dig> with about  <dig> and  <dig> genes selected respectively. this means that all three methods can be successfully applied to high-dimensional classification problems and classify the leukaemia dataset with same accuracies. note that, the l1/ <dig> method achieved its success using only about  <dig> predictors , compared to about  <dig> and  <dig> for the len and l <dig> methods. for prostate and colon datasets, it can be seen the l1/ <dig> method achieves the best classification performances with the highest accuracy rates using much fewer genes compared with those of the len and l <dig> methods. for dlbcl dataset, the l1/ <dig> logistic regression achieves better classification performance than that of the l <dig> method and worse than that of the len method. however, as well as other three datasets, the l1/ <dig> method achieved its success using much less predictors , compared to about  <dig> and  <dig> for the len and l <dig> methods. this is an important consideration for screening and diagnostic applications, where the goal is often to develop an accurate test using as few features as possible in order to control cost.

figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> display the solution paths and the gene selection results of the three methods for the prostate dataset in one sample run. here the x-axis displays the number of running steps, the y-axis in the left sub-figure is the coefficients measured gene importance and the y-axis in the right sub-figure is the misclassification errors based on the ten-fold cross validation. the optimal results of three methods are shown as vertical dotted lines. figure  <dig> indicates that the number of nonzero coefficients  of the optimal results obtained by the l1/ <dig> method is  <dig>  in contrast, figures  <dig> and  <dig> indicate that the numbers of nonzero coefficients  of optimal results obtained by the len and l <dig> methods are  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. generally speaking, the penalized logistic regression methods can be successfully applied to the cancer classification problems with high dimensional and low samples microarray data, and our proposed l1/ <dig> method achieves better performance especially in gene selection.

brief biological analyses of the selected genes
the summaries of the  <dig> top-ranked informative genes found by the three sparse logistic regression methods for  <dig> gene expression datasets are shown in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the genes with star are the most frequently selected genes to construct the classifiers according to the last column of table  <dig>  and the common genes obtained by each classifier are emphasized with bold. the biologically experimental results proved some genes included in the frequently selected gene sets that produce high classification accuracy rate are mostly and functionally related to carcinogenesis or tumor histogenesis. for example, in table  <dig>  the most frequently selected gene set of each sparse logistic method for leukemia classification, including cystatin c  and myeloperoxidase  genes, that achieve high classification accuracy by the l1/ <dig> method, are experimentally proved to be correlated to leukemia of all or aml. the cystatin c gene is located at the extracellular region of the cell and has role in invasiveness of human glioblastoma cells. decrease of cystatin c in the csf might contribute to the process of metastasis and spread of the cancer cells in the leptomeningeal tissues  <cit> . the myeloperoxidase gene is taking role in anti-apoptosis process where cancer cells kill themselves  <cit> . for the colon dataset , the most frequently selected gene set of each sparse logistic method includes genes such as guanylate cyclase activator 2b , myosin, light chain  <dig>  alkali, smooth muscle and non-muscle  and human desmin  genes. these genes are the top  <dig> significant informative genes ranked by our proposed l1/ <dig> method and also selected by ben-dor et al.  <cit> , yang and song  <cit>  and li et al.  <cit> . on the top of these genes lists is guanylate cyclase activator 2b  gene. notterman et al.  <cit>  showed that a reduction of uroguanylin might be an indication of colon tumors, and shailubhai et al.  <cit>  reported that treatment with uroguanylin has a positive therapeutic significance to the reduction in pre-cancerous colon ploys.

the genes with star are the most frequently selected genes to construct the classifiers according to the last column of table  <dig>  and the common genes obtained by l1/ <dig> , len , l <dig> classifiers are emphasized with bold.

the genes with star are the most frequently selected genes to construct the classifiers according to the last column of table  <dig>  and the common genes obtained by l1/ <dig> , len , l <dig> classifiers are emphasized with bold.

in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  some genes are only frequently selected by the l1/ <dig> method, but not discovered by the len and l <dig> methods. the evidence from the literatures showed that they are cancer related genes. for example, for the colon dataset, the genes cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, delta polypeptide  and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule- <dig>  were also selected by maglietta r. et al.  <cit> , wiese a.h. et al.  <cit> , wang s. l. et al.  <cit> , and dai j. h. and xu q.  <cit> . these genes can significantly discriminate between non-dissected tumors and micro dissected invasive tumor cells. it is remarkable that apparently  some discovered genes that have not been seen in any past studies.

on the other hand, from tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we found that the most frequently selected genes and their ranking orders by the len and l <dig> methods are much similar compared with those of the l1/ <dig> method. the main reasons are that the classification hypothesis needs not be unique as the samples in gene expression data lie in a high-dimensional space, and both of the len and l <dig> methods are based on the l <dig> type penalty.

construct knn classifier with the most frequently selected relevant genes
in this section, to further evaluate the performance and prediction generality of the sparse logistic regression with l1/ <dig> penalty, we constructed knn  classifiers using the relevant genes which were most frequently selected by the l1/ <dig> penalized logistic regression method. in this experiment, we use the random leave-one-out cross validation  to evaluate the predictive ability and repeat  <dig> runs.

table  <dig> summarizes classification accuracies of four datasets with knn classifiers with selected genes by our proposed methods. from table  <dig>  we can see that all the classification accuracies are high than 90%, especially the classification accuracy on the leukaemia dataset is  <dig> %. the knn classifiers with relevant genes which were selected by the sparse logistic regression with the l1/ <dig> penalty can achieve high classification accuracy. the results indicate that the sparse logistic regression with the l1/ <dig> penalty can select power discrimination genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in cancer classification application based on microarray data, only a small subset of genes is strongly indicative of a targeted disease. thus, feature selection methods play an important role in cancer classification. in this paper, we propose and model sparse logistic regression with the l1/ <dig> penalty, and develop the corresponding coordinate descent algorithm as a novel gene selection approach. the proposed method utilizes a novel univariate half thresholding to update the estimated coefficients.

both simulation and microarray data studies show that the sparse logistic regression with the l1/ <dig> penalty achieve higher classification accuracy than those of ordinary l <dig> and elastic net regularization approaches, while fewer but informative genes are selected. therefore, the sparse logistic regression with the l1/ <dig> penalty is the effective technique for gene selection in real classification problem.

in this paper, we use the proposed method to solve binary cancer classification problem. however, many cancer classification problems involve multi-category microarray data. we plan to extend our proposed method to solve multinomial penalized logistic regression for multiclass cancer classification in our future work.
