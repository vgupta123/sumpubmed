BACKGROUND
eukaryotic transcription is a highly regulated process. transcription activation in eukaryotes requires the modification of histones on enhancers and promoters  <cit> . histone acetylation plays a major role in this modification, and forms histone codes in combination with methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination  <cit> . one potential postulate of histone codes is that defined patterns of modification in histones can be recognized by specific factors. bromodomain, a conserved ~ <dig> amino acid module that is originally identified by sequence alignment as a common motif among drosophila brahma, female-sterile homeotic  and four other potential transcription regulators  <cit> , can recognize acetylation of histones  <cit>  and is thought to participate in deciphering the histone codes  <cit> . bromodomain-containing proteins have been classified into several distinct subgroups:  histone acetyltransferases , including gcn <dig>  p/caf and tafii250;  atp-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes, including brahma, swi <dig>  snf <dig> and brg1;  the less-characterized bet  family, which is a novel class of transcriptional regulators carrying two tandem bromodomains and an et domain  <cit> . retention on chromosomes during mitosis is likely a distinctive feature of the bet family  <cit> , because proteins of other bromodomain families are displaced from chromosomes during mitosis  <cit> . there are four mammalian protein members of bet family: brd2/ring <dig> , orfx , brd4/hunk <dig> , brdt .

brd <dig> gene is initially identified as an open reading frame localized to the class ii major histocompatibility locus on human chromosome 6p <dig>  and is related to the drosophila gene female sterile homeotic   <cit> . the homologous genes in mouse  <cit> , frog  <cit> , and zebrafish  <cit> , have been reported. brd <dig> is a nuclear-localized serine-threonine kinase that has elevated activity in human leukemias  <cit> . it has been shown to synergistically transactivate cell cycle regulatory genes, including cyclin d <dig>  cyclin a, cyclin e and dihydrofolate reductase , in combination with ras or mekk through e2fs  <cit> . a murine homologue of brd <dig> is contained in a mediator transcription complex that involves homologues of the yeast transcriptional regulators med <dig>  med <dig>  rgr <dig>  and srb <dig>  <cit> . later on, brd <dig> is reported to associate with a transcription complex containing e2f- <dig>  e2f- <dig>  tbp and chromatin remodeling machines  <cit> , and to serve as a bridge between e2f- <dig> and tbp  <cit> . brd <dig> is also reported to associate with mediator subunits cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> , thyroid receptor-associated protein  <dig> , and the pol ii large subunit   <cit> . directed overexpression of brd <dig> in mouse lymphocytes is found to develop b-cell lymphoma and leukemia  <cit> . in addition, brd <dig> can interact with latent nuclear antigen  of kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus   <cit> . taken together, these reports indicate that brd <dig> can serve as a transcription regulator and a contributing element in oncogenesis.

the bromodomains of brd <dig> have been shown to selectively bind to histone h <dig> tails acetylated at lys <dig>  and to be responsible for mitotic retention on chromosomes  <cit> . the bromodomains are essential for transcriptional activation of important e2f-responsive genes by brd <dig> through e2fs. bromodomain-deletion derivant of brd <dig> has a high level of autophosphorylation activity and exhibites significant e2f- <dig> phosphorylation in vitro compared with wild-type  <cit> . it is also reported that the association of brd <dig> with e2fs, mediator components and pol ii is dependent on the presence of and is stimulated by acetylated histone h <dig> and h <dig> peptides  <cit> . the association with e2fs and specific interaction with acetylated histones both establish anchor points for brd2-containing transcription complex to cyclin a promoter  <cit> . in addition, brd <dig>  also associates with mitotic chromosomes, and tethers viral dna to host's mitotic chromosomes  <cit> . brd <dig> interacts with p-tefb through its bromodomains and stimulates pol ii-dependent transcription  <cit> . hence the bromodomains and their recognition of specific acetylated histones play important roles in functions of bet family members. bromodomains of the bet family differ substantially from those of other families in amino acid sequence, despite that they share conserved hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic core of the domain. previous studies showed that different bromodomains have different specificities for binding to acetylated histones in living cells  <cit> . however, it is yet unknown the structural basis for brd <dig> recognizing the specific acetylated histone code. here, we have determined the solution structure of the second bromodomain  of brd <dig> by nmr and studied its binding properties to acetylated histone h <dig>  comparing this structure with bromodomains from other proteins, significant differences are found in loop regions; specifically some additional secondary structures exist in brd <dig> bd <dig>  using nmr titration experiments, the conserved hydrophobic cavity that is previously characterized in other bromodomains is found to serve as a binding site for histone h <dig> acetylated at k <dig>  through mutational analysis, we detected that the basic residues flanking the acetylated lysine of histone h <dig> peptides, and some resides in loop regions of brd <dig> bd <dig> are important for their mutual recognition. our results provide further structural and functional details aimed at revealing how brd <dig> and other bet members recognize specific acetylated histone codes and thus impact transcription.

the tertiary structure of brd <dig> bd <dig> consists of seven distinct helices and is totally 74% helical, which is consistent with the circular dichroism prediction . four of the α-helices, αz , αa , αb  and αc , are arranged in closely compact, left-handed bundle  in an antiparallel manner. crossing angles between adjacent helices αz and αa, αz and αc are ~30°, while those between helices αa and αb, αb and αc are ~10–20°. most of the slowly exchanging nh protons in 1h-2h exchange experiments were found within these regions , which indicated that protection occurred most likely by formation of hydrogen bonds here. in the long za loop between helices αz and αa, there are three additional short helices: α-helices αz'  and αa' , and an uncommon π-helix, termed helix πd . the two helices αz' and αa' are conserved in hsbrg <dig> and gcn <dig> bromodomains, while helix πd is also found in brd <dig> bd <dig>   <cit>  and brd <dig> bd <dig> . the three helix structures were also confirmed by helix-typical noes. besides, helix αz' was further affirmed by 1h-2h exchange experiments. the helix αz' is orthogonal to helices αz and αa. two hydrogen bonds are formed between backbone carbonyl groups of f <dig> and y <dig> with backbone amide groups of l <dig> and s <dig>  respectively, serving to cap the helix αa and help to anchor the long za loop. a typical 'capping box' motif in n cap  <cit>  involving a hydrogen bond between od <dig> of asp  and nh of n <dig>  was also found to cap the helix αa. both d <dig> and t <dig> are highly conserved in bromodomain sequences . both helices αa' and πd may be quite flexible or in 'structure breath' states for ligand binding because helix αa' contacts only with helix αb , helix πd has no residue interacting directly with the other helices, and few long-range noes and no slow-exchange nh protons are observed in these regions  <cit> .

at the top of the protein , a groove with a cavity at the bottom could be seen clearly on the contact surface . the cavity is lined by the side-chains of residues  mainly from the za and bc loops . most of the residues are hydrophobic and highly conserved in bromodomain sequences. from surface hydrophobic potential and electrostatic potential mapping, the cavity is shown to be hydrophobic and electroneutral in nature, suitable for hydrophobic contact mediating protein-peptide interactions. five aspartate residues  form a negatively charged collar surrounding the edge of the hydrophobic cavity . it has been proposed that these acidic residues may play a role in the specificity of bromodomain ligand binding  <cit> .

structure comparison with other bromodomains
in spite that brd <dig> bd <dig> share only 22–37% sequence identity with published bromodomain structures of hsgcn <dig>  scgcn <dig>  hscbp, hsp/caf, hsbrg <dig>  and of the double bromodomain from tafii <dig>  <cit> , the overall secondary elements and structural fold of brd <dig> bd <dig> resemble those published bromodomains, as shown by the backbone superposition of those structures on the average, energy-minimized structure of brd <dig> bd <dig>  and . the pairwise backbone rmsds of those structures to brd <dig> bd <dig> are between  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å. recently, the structures of brd <dig> bd <dig> and brd <dig> bd <dig>  have also been solved. brd <dig> bd <dig> possesses high sequence identity and structural similarities to its bet members , with pairwise backbone rmsds between  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å. figure  <dig> shows the backbone superposition of brd <dig> bd <dig> on brd <dig> bd <dig>  our results give further evidence that the unique structural fold, especially the four-helix left-handed bundle involving helices αz, αa, αb and αc, is highly conserved in the bromodomain family.

the majority of structural deviations are localized in the loop regions, particularly the long za loop. there are different additional secondary structures in the za loop, including helices αz', πd and αa' . all the bromodomain structures solved possess helix αa', and all have helix αz' except hscbp. in the bromodomains of hsgcn <dig>  hsbrg <dig> and brd <dig> bd <dig> the helix αz' is a 310-helix  <cit> , while in brd <dig> bd <dig> it is an α-helix defined by typical α-helical noe and hydrogen bond patterns . another character of helix αz' in brd <dig> bd <dig> is that it is longer compared with the others. an uncommon π-helix, helix πd, is localized in the center of the za loop of brd <dig> bd2; relevant α-helices are present in brd <dig> bd <dig> and brd <dig> bd <dig>  but no corresponding helices are present in other bromodomain structures . a sequence feature of brd <dig> bd <dig> and its bet family members is that they have a long za loop and a two amino acids insertion. coincidently, the two amino acids insertion of brd <dig> bd <dig>  is in the helix πd and contributes to the hydrophobic groove, consequently it may play a role in ligand selectivity. the helix πd could be a structural characteristic of brd <dig> bd <dig> and other bet bromodomains . in the sequence of hsbrg <dig> bromodomain, there is also an insertion which forms a βz sheet between helices αz and αz' <cit> . both the uncommon helix πd in brd <dig> bd <dig> and the βz sheet in hsbrg <dig> support the view that bromodomains present in different proteins must harbor sufficient structural diversities to support specific recognition of acetylation codes.

binding interface of h4-ack <dig> peptide on brd <dig> bd2
a previous study has demonstrated that brd <dig> selectively interacts with acetylated lys  <dig> on histone h <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, we have designed three histone tail peptides , h2b-ack <dig>  h4-ack <dig> and h4-ack <dig>  to titrate brd <dig> bd <dig> using nmr experiments. the h4-ack <dig> peptide induced a number of distinct chemical shift perturbations in the resonances of backbone amide groups of brd <dig> bd <dig> in the 1h-15n hsqc spectrum . these chemical shift changes increased gradually throughout the titration that was taken to a maximum h4-ack <dig> peptide: brd <dig> bd <dig> ratio of 10: <dig>  these data indicate interactions between brd <dig> bd <dig> and h4-ack <dig> peptide, and show that the peptide and the protein are in fast exchange between free and bound states on the nmr chemical shift timescale. four most perturbed and not severely overlapped residues, g <dig>  l <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig>  were plotted in figure 4b, and the dissociation constant  for h4-ack <dig> peptide was estimated to be ~ <dig>  mm  <cit> . unlike h4-ack <dig> peptide, h4-ack <dig> peptide just slightly perturbed the chemical shifts of several residues such as g <dig>  l <dig> and y <dig> at very high peptide concentrations and didn't appear to interact significantly with brd <dig> bd <dig>  addition of h2b ack <dig> peptide resulted in little, if any, chemical shift perturbations of any protein residue, even at high concentrations. totally, our titration analysis showed that brd <dig> bd <dig> selectively bound to h4-ack <dig>  which was consistent with a previous report  <cit> ; further we acquired the kd value for brd <dig> bd <dig> binding to h4-ack <dig> and determined this interaction to be dynamic in solution.

additionally, our titration results made us to move forward to map the binding interface of h4-ack <dig> peptide on brd <dig> bd <dig> . most residues experienced significant chemical shift changes upon addition of h4-ack <dig> peptide were concentrated in the za and bc loop, and the α-helical regions immediately flanking the bc loop. among these residues, d <dig>  l <dig>  g <dig>  l <dig>  h <dig>  d <dig>  y <dig>  h <dig>  d <dig>  y <dig> and a <dig> showed combined chemical shift changes of more than the mean value plus one standard deviation, and residues f <dig>  a <dig>  h <dig>  l <dig>  m <dig>  f <dig>  y <dig>  n <dig>  d <dig>  h <dig>  d <dig>  a <dig>  m <dig>  r <dig>  k <dig>  v <dig>  k <dig> and m <dig> had combined chemical shift changes larger than mean value. many of the residues that were significantly disturbed contribute to the hydrophobic pocket of brd <dig> bd <dig> that serves as a primary binding surface for acetyl-lysine as in the other bromodomains   <cit> .

mutational analysis
the complex structure of scgcn <dig> bromodomain with h4-ack <dig> peptide revealed that the major binding determinant was the acetylated lysine and that the secondary interaction came from the side chains at k+ <dig> and k+ <dig> positions  <cit> . the scgcn <dig> bromodomain only contacted with acetylated lys  <dig>  his  <dig>  and arg  <dig> . the corresponding residues in h4-ack <dig> peptide are unconserved gly  <dig>  and ala  <dig>  . we designed a set of mutations of the h4-ack <dig> peptide to determine which residues are critical for binding brd <dig> bd <dig>  nmr titrations of wild type brd <dig> bd <dig> were performed using h4-ack <dig> mutant peptides, including h4-l10a, h4-l10g, h4-a15g, h4-acid and the unacetylated peptide h4-u . the h4-u and h4-acid peptides did not disturb any residue amide resonances of brd <dig> bd <dig>  indicating that acetylated h <dig> tail was the preferred substrate and that those basic residues, lys  <dig>  lys  <dig> and arg  <dig> of h <dig> tail, could play an important role in the interactions. the h4-l10a and h4-l10g peptides induced small but still significant resonance shifts. the chemical shift changes induced by h4-a15g were like those in response to h4-ack <dig> at a low peptide: brd <dig> bd <dig> ratio of less than 4: <dig>  strikingly, when h4-a15g peptide: brd <dig> bd <dig> ratio was large than 4: <dig>  all the amide resonances of brd <dig> bd <dig> disappeared. this phenomenon was confirmed by repeated titration experiments with two different protein concentrations .

further more, brd <dig> bd <dig> mutants, including v329a, l334a, l336a and n382a, were titrated with the h4-ack <dig> peptide, respectively. the integrity of brd <dig> bd <dig> mutants were assessed by their 15n-hsqc spectra. compared with the 15n-hsqc spectrum of brd <dig> bd <dig>  mutants v329a and n382a showed significant differences of amide resonances for residues in the za and bc loop, and some residues localized in the termini of helices αb and αc; mutant l336a exhibited moderate differences for residues in the za and bc loop; whereas mutant l334a just slightly affected vicinal residues  and . both mutants v329a and n382a showed no binding to h4-ack <dig> peptide, which should be attributed to severe disruption of the conformation of the binding cavity. mutants l334a and l336a have fewer residues perturbed upon h4-ack <dig> binding than wild type brd <dig> bd <dig>  and the perturbations are smaller. the unambiguous and significantly perturbed residue g <dig> was followed during titrations and plotted in figure  <dig> 

dynamic properties of brd <dig> bd2
the longitudinal relaxation times , transverse relaxation times  and ratio of noe intensity are recorded to probe the dynamic properties of brd <dig> bd <dig>  the t <dig> relaxation times were obtained for 85% of the backbone amide protons; the t <dig> relaxation times and 1h-15n heteronuclear noe values were obtained for 90% of the backbone amide protons . the overall rotational correlation time  of the ~ <dig> -kd brd <dig> bd <dig> is  <dig> ns , suggesting that bd <dig> is mainly monomeric in solution. the average 1h-15n noe value is  <dig>  ±  <dig> , indicating that most of the regions of brd <dig> bd <dig> are relatively rigid, corresponding well with the narrow distribution of conformers in the calculated ensemble. some residues in the za and bc loop have relatively lower 1h-15n noe values and these two loops construct the ligand-binding groove of brd <dig> bd <dig>  and .

discussion
bet family is a less characterized novel class of bromodomain-containing proteins  <cit> . in the present work, we have determined the solution structure of the second bromodomain of brd <dig>  which shares more sequence identity with other bet bromodomains than with bromodomans of other families . the structure of brd <dig> bd <dig> consists of a previously characterized four-helix left-handed bundle, with additional helices in za loop. compared with other published bromodomain structures, extensive structural variations are found in loop regions ; especially, in za loop there exists an uncommon helix πd that is also present in bet family members brd <dig> bd <dig> and brd <dig> bd <dig>  we speculate that the specific recognition of h4-ack <dig> may involve this helix πd. recently published structure of hsbrg <dig> bromodomain reveals a βz sheet insertion between helices αz and αz'. the βz sheet is proposed to have a role in orienting an acetylated substrate by changing the flexibility of the za loop  <cit> . the observations of the uncommon helix πd insertion in brd <dig> bd <dig> and the βz sheet insertion in hsbrg <dig> demonstrate that different bromodomains must have sufficient structural diversities to support specific recognition of acetylation codes. more and more information appears about the important functions of proteins in the bet family; especially that it is observed that brd <dig>  as well as bdf <dig> and brd <dig>  remains mitotically associated with chromatin  <cit> . our study provides a structural basis to further understand the functions of proteins in the bet family.

consistent with a former study  <cit> , our nmr titration experiments show that brd <dig> bd <dig> specifically binds to h4-ack <dig> peptide. we acquired the kd value  for this specific binding and determined the interaction to be dynamic in solution. brd <dig> bd <dig> binds to h4-ack <dig> peptide with much lower affinity and does not bind to h2b-ack <dig> peptide or unacetylated peptide h4-u at all. while the full length brd <dig> can bind to h2b acetylated at k5/k <dig>  <cit> , brd <dig> bd <dig> can not. one possibility is that brd <dig> bd <dig> is responsible for this interaction. the binding interface of h4-ack <dig> peptide on brd <dig> bd <dig> is further identified by nmr titration experiments, which is a conserved hydrophobic and electroneutral cavity with a negative-charged collar formed by five aspartate residues . these aspartate residues exhibited significant chemical shift changes in brd <dig> bd <dig> titration with h4-ack <dig> peptide and served as a secondary binding site as in hsgcn <dig> bromodomain  <cit> . the n-terminal tail of histone h <dig> is positively charged; and coincidently, when the positively charged residues  flanking the acetylated lysine were mutated to negatively charged residues, brd <dig> bd <dig> no longer bound to this peptide . when another flanking residue ala  <dig> on h4-ack <dig> peptide was substituted with glycine, it induced high aggregation of brd <dig> bd <dig> with an unknown mechanism. thus, the residue ala  <dig> may also have a role in the specific recognition of h4-ack <dig> by brd <dig> bd <dig>  the complex structure of scgcn <dig> with h4-ack <dig> peptide revealed a primary interaction provided by acetylated lysine and a secondary interaction came from k+ <dig> and k+ <dig> positions  <cit> . our result of brd <dig> bd <dig> not binding to unacetylated peptide h4-u also solidate the notion that an acetylated lysine is a determinant in bromodomain-ligand recognition. residues lys  <dig>  lys  <dig> and arg  <dig>  provide a secondary recognition, while the residue ala  <dig>  may also be involved in the interaction with brd <dig> bd <dig>  so the interaction mode for brd <dig> bd <dig> with h4-ack <dig> peptide may be different from that of scgcn5-h4-ack <dig> complex, which is further supported by the observation of large sequence and structural variations in the za and bc loops between brd <dig> bd <dig> and scgcn <dig> .

the h4-ack <dig> peptide binding pocket on brd <dig> bd <dig> is constructed of many conserved or type-conserved resides. to determine which is crucial for h4-ack <dig> recognition, we designed a series of mutations in the binding cavity, including v329a, y339f, y339a and n382a in respect that all these corresponding residues in hsp/caf, hscbp or scgcn <dig> bromodomains have extensive contacts with their ligands. especially, the highly conserved residue n <dig> may be involved in orienting the acetylated lys  <dig> as its corresponding residue n <dig> in scgcn <dig>  <cit> . mutant n382a was constructed to examine its effect in h4-ack <dig> interaction. 15n-hsqc spectra revealed that when the conserved residue v <dig> or n <dig> is mutated to alanine, the brd <dig> bd <dig> conformation is disrupted throughout za and bc loops, even extending to the helices b and c for n382a mutant. neither mutant v329a nor mutant n382a binds to h4-ack <dig> peptide. for y339f and y339a mutants, the recombinant proteins have converted into inclusion body when expressed in e. coli . thus these highly conserved residues may be more important in maintaining a proper conformation for ligand recognition. on the other hand, l334a or l336a mutant just mildly disturbs a few adjacent residues and most likely doesn't affect the conformation of the binding pocket. however, these two mutants bind to h4-ack <dig> with much lower affinities compared with wild type brd <dig> bd <dig>  mutation-induced function disruption may be the main reason for l334a and l336a mutants not binding to h4-ack <dig> peptide. both residues l <dig> and l <dig> are localized in helix πd , and l334g <dig> forms a two amino acids insertion unique to brd <dig> bd <dig> and other bet members. our results definitely show that the two amino acids insertion and helix πd are implicated in brd <dig> bd <dig> and h4-ack <dig> peptide interaction. however, the complex structure of brd <dig> bd <dig> with h <dig> ack <dig> peptide is needed to completely understand the interaction mechanism.

the solution structure of brd <dig> bd <dig> is monomeric, whereas the crystal structure of brd <dig> bd <dig> is determined to be a homodimer  <cit> . no inter-molecular noes were observed in brd <dig> bd <dig>  which was consistent with monomeric state as indicated by gel-filtration and gst-pull down analysis . it is not surprising that brd <dig> bd <dig> shares only 46% sequence identity with bd <dig> and the dimeric residues are just partially conserved in bd <dig>  in fact, the equivalent bd1s or bd2s from different proteins of bet family share higher homologies than the non-equivalent bd <dig> and bd <dig> in the same protein. although both brd <dig> bd <dig> and bd <dig> specifically recognize the same acetylated histone h <dig> tail, it is reasonable to propose that they play distinctive roles in brd <dig> functions. in the brd <dig> containing coactivator complex, bd <dig> may be a dimeric module and interacts with tbp  <cit> , while bd <dig> may mainly serve to bind to acetylated histones. it is also probable that brd <dig> bd <dig> and bd <dig> interact with acetylated histones in different context. and multi-bromodomains could enhance the affinity for acetylated histones. an intriguing question immediately rises and waits to answer. how brd <dig> bd <dig> and bd <dig> cooperate to regulate brd <dig> functions, and thus modulate its transcriptional activation effect?

CONCLUSIONS
brd <dig> bd <dig> is monomeric in solution and interacts weakly and dynamically but specifically with h4-ack <dig>  the helix πd in the long za loop may be a common characteristic of bet bromodomains. the conserved hydrophobic cavity is found to serve as a primary binding site for h4-ack <dig> as in other bromodomains. a negatively charged collar of the cavity serves as a secondary binding site for h4-ack <dig>  actually, the flanking basic residues on h4-ack <dig> are important for their mutual recognition. brd <dig> bd <dig> and bd <dig> may cooperate to regulate brd <dig> functions. the structure of brd <dig> bd <dig> will help to further characterize bet family members.
