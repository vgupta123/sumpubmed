BACKGROUND
the giant panda is an endangered animal with a restricted habitat in south-western china. a survey revealed that only about  <dig>  individuals remain in the wild  <cit> . the highly specialized reproductive behaviour  <cit>  and low fertility make it difficult to increase their numbers quickly by breeding in captivity. in recent years, strenuous efforts have been made to protect this animal and considerable knowledge of its physiology, biochemistry, genetic diversity and ecology has been achieved, but research on the giant panda genome is still rare. so far only a few genes have been cloned and two have been mapped to specific giant panda chromosomes  <cit> .

a bacterial artificial chromosome  library is a powerful tool for studying genomes. compared with yeast artificial chromosome  clones, bac clones have many advantages such as high stability, easy manipulation and rare chimerism  <cit> . bac libraries of human  <cit>  and major livestock  <cit>  have been constructed and widely used, but no such large-insert genomic dna library has been reported to date for the giant panda.

we have constructed and characterized a seven-genome equivalent bac library of the giant panda, and located ten genes to specific chromosomes by fish using their bac clones as probes.

RESULTS
bac library construction
the bac library was constructed by cloning genomic dna isolated from the white blood cells of a male giant panda, and partially digested with bamhi/hindiii, into the vector pbelobac <dig>  it contains  <dig>  clones, which were deposited in  <dig> 384-well plates. among these  <dig>  clones,  <dig> were from bamhi digestion and  <dig> from hindiii digestion.

insert size distribution
to evaluate the average size of inserted fragments in the library, dnas were prepared from  <dig> randomly selected clones, cleaved with noti and subjected to pulse-field gel electrophoresis with midrange pfg marker ii . the insert size distribution is shown in figure  <dig>  the average insert size of these  <dig> clones is  <dig> kb, indicating that the library represents a 7-fold coverage of the giant panda haploid genome. among the  <dig> clones, only  <dig> had no insert, suggesting that the percentage of non-recombination in the library is about  <dig> %. approximately 53% of the clones contain inserts larger than  <dig> kb.

bac library screening
to assess the quality of this library further,  <dig> microsatellite markers were used for screening. the number of positive superpools varied from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  . at the same time,  <dig> giant panda genes  were also screened in the library using pcr. as shown in table  <dig>  the number of positive bac clones varied from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig> . the actual number of clones obtained was slightly lower than was calculated theoretically, but at least  <dig> positive bacs for each of the genes were identified from the library.

gene mapping by fish
to estimate the fraction of chimeric clones in the bac library, and furthermore to map some of the genes, a fish approach was used. ten bac clones, containing agxt, ghr, fshr, irbp, sox <dig>  ttr, bdnf, nt- <dig>  lh and zfx <dig> respectively, were mapped to  <dig> pairs of giant panda chromosomes. the specific locations of the  <dig> functional genes on the g-banded ideogram are listed in figure  <dig>  the band names of each chromosome are not given because no international standard karyotype has yet been established for the giant panda. the order of chromosomes was identified according to a previous study  <cit>  by analyzing the size, g-band and centromere location. fifteen metaphases were analyzed to map each gene.

discussion
we have successfully constructed a giant panda bac library, which is large-insert, deep-coverage and publicly available. one obstacle to genomic and molecular biology research on the giant panda is the difficulty of collecting samples. this bac library will partially solve the problem.

bac clones can be used as valuable probes for cytogenetic mapping by fish. in this study, we successfully mapped  <dig> genes to giant panda chromosomes using their bac clones as probes. thus, the number of molecular markers on giant panda chromosomes could be increased to  <dig>  however, a major obstacle to this study in fish mapping is the preparation of chromosome samples. giant panda fibroblast cells cultured in our laboratory grew too slowly to provide sufficient high-quality chromosome samples. therefore, only ten genes were mapped to chromosomes, though we had prepared for localizing fifteen genes by using the relative bac clones.

the homologous relationship of chromosomes between human and giant panda has been established on the basis of comparative painting studies  <cit> , so we deduced the approximate chromosome locations of the ten giant panda genes  according to their human chromosome homologues  <cit> . six genes, agxt, ghr, fshr, irbp, sox <dig> and ttr, were mapped to their expected chromosomes by fish , confirming the homologies of six pairs of chromosomes between giant panda and human, and identifying more precisely the regions of these chromosomes that are conserved between the two species.

the signals of the bac clone harbouring zfx <dig> were visualized both around the centromere of chromosome x and at the terminal of chromosome y. since zfx <dig> is located on chromosome x in almost all mammals, the specific signal at the terminal of chromosome y may be because the bac clone contains a fragment that is homologous between chromosomes x and y, or because it is a chimeric clone.

lh and nt- <dig> were both mapped on the same band of ame16q , and these two genes are also close in the human genome . this suggests that they belong to a conserved genome block. bdnf was mapped to chromosome 15q; its homologue in human is located at chromosome 11p <dig> , which indicates the conserved syntenic homology between ame15q and hsa11p. however, the mapping results for these three genes are not consistent with the giant panda-human comparative painting data  owing to the problem of identifying chromosome order. in the giant panda, the sizes and morphologies of chromosomes  <dig> to  <dig> are so similar that the same chromosome has been designated different chromosome orders in different studies  <cit> . this problem will be solved when more markers are mapped to these chromosomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the first representative giant panda genomic bac library has been constructed, covering about seven equivalents of the giant panda genome. this bac library will serve as a valuable resource for genomic research on the endangered species. we also mapped  <dig> genes to their relative chromosomes by fish using their bac clones as probes, and this enriched the giant panda cytogentic map.
