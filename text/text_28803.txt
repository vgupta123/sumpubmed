BACKGROUND
most respiratory virus infections are relatively benign and self-limited events. however, infection with highly pathogenic viruses can result in more severe sequelae, in which disease progresses to respiratory failure due to uncontrolled inflammation, pulmonary edema, and damage to lung tissue  <cit> .

as part of an ongoing effort to understand inflammatory responses during severe respiratory virus infection, we have developed an inhalation model using the natural rodent pathogen, pneumonia virus of mice . originally identified by horsfall and colleagues  <cit> , pvm is a pneumovirus  that is closely related to respiratory syncytial virus , and is among the few characterized mouse models of virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome   <cit> . among the prominent features of this infection, a minimal intranasal inoculum  results in robust virus replication within bronchial epithelial cells that is accompanied by profound granulocyte recruitment. in the absence of pharmacologic intervention, pvm infection progresses to pulmonary edema and respiratory compromise, similar to the more severe forms of rsv infection experienced by human infants  <cit> . in our earlier studies, we identified the chemokine ccl <dig>  as a crucial component of this inflammatory response. pvm not only elicits production of ccl <dig> by infected bronchial epithelial cells  <cit> , mice devoid of ccl <dig> or its receptor, ccr <dig>  recruit dramatically fewer neutrophils to airways  <cit> . blockade of the ccl3/ccr <dig> proinflammatory signaling pathway in conjunction with antiviral therapy resulted in improved survival in response to an otherwise lethal virus inoculum  <cit> . as ccl <dig> is only one of several major pro-inflammatory signaling pathways activated by pvm infection  <cit> , there is certainly the possibility of additive, synergistic, or hierarchical means to promote and to amplify the ongoing inflammatory response.

although first identified as a component of the antiviral response to sindbis virus  <cit> , the role of the th <dig> cytokine, interferon-γ  in pneumovirus infection remains uncertain. ifnγ is readily detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasal washings from rsv-infected infants  <cit> , and minimal or absent response has been correlated with poor clinical outcome  <cit> . ifnγ is also detected in bal fluid of balb/c mice in response to challenge with rsv virions  <cit>  and plays a role in limiting the inflammatory response to secondary challenge and in generating the allergic histopathology in response to formalin-fixed rsv vaccine antigens and virion components  <cit> . likewise, local production of ifnγ is a prominent response to pvm infection  <cit> , although its role in modulating the primary inflammatory response has not yet been fully explored.

in this manuscript, we explore the role of ifnγ in modulating the inflammatory response to pvm infection, and utilize overexpression analysis to begin a dissection of the independent and interdependent contributions of both ifn-γ and ccl <dig> to the process of neutrophil recruitment in vivo.

RESULTS
microarray profiling of ifnγ expression in response to pvm infection
transcript encoding the cytokine ifnγ was detected in mouse lung tissue at various time points in response to pvm infection  <cit> . in response to a non-lethal inoculum of pvm strain j <dig>  ifnγ mrna was detected above baseline levels beginning on day  <dig>  ifn-γ mrna levels peak at day  <dig> after inoculation, and fall rapidly to baseline between days  <dig> –  <dig>  shown in figure 1a are profiles of the  <dig> transcripts  that display kinetic expression correlations of  <dig>  or greater with the ifn-γ profile, as per the 'find similar' algorithm of genespring gx  <dig> . selected transcripts, categorized by function, are listed in table  <dig>  among the transcripts that correlate with the ifnγ profile are  <dig> characterized interferon-response genes. most intriguing is the close correlation  between the expression patterns of ifnγ and ccl <dig> . ccl <dig> is essential for granulocyte recruitment in response to pvm infection  <cit> . as shown in figure 1b, there is a significant correlation between levels of immunoreactive ifnγ and ccl <dig> in lung tissue from individual pvm-infected mice.

the microarray analysis software package, genespring gx  <dig>  'find similar' function was used to inspect all transcript profiles for patterns related to that displayed by ifn-γ. the minimum correlation considered to be similar was set at  <dig>  .

detection ifnγ+ nk and t cells in pvm infected lung tissue
both total and ifnγ+ subsets of nk cells, cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were enumerated in single cell suspensions of lung tissue from pvm-infected balb/c mice evaluated at day  <dig> after inoculation with  <dig> pfu pvm strain j <dig> . only a small fraction  of the cd4+ t cells detected at this time point stained positively for ifnγ, in contrast to the larger fraction of ifnγ+cd8+ t cells detected . interestingly, 23% of the total nk cells  stained positively for ifnγ, an increase from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells, or 4% of the total nk cells detected in a single lung from uninfected mice .

ifnγ-dependent responses to pvm infection
wild type and ifnγ receptor gene deleted  mice were infected with pvm and various parameters relating to the inflammatory response were assessed. neutrophil recruitment to the airways was markedly diminished in ifnγr -/- mice , reduced from  <dig> ±  <dig> per  <dig> hpfs among wild type to  <dig> ±  <dig>  hpfs among ifnγr -/- mice, as determined on cytospin preparations of cells in bal fluid . these findings are consistent with those of frey and colleagues  <cit> , who described reduced inflammation in association with reduced ifnγ production in the lungs of pvm infected, t-cell deficient mice. given our earlier studies on the essential role of ccl <dig> in eliciting neutrophil recruitment, it is interesting to note that the absence of ifnγ signaling had no impact on local production of this chemokine in response to pvm infection . ifnγ was also detected in response to pvm infection in both wild type and in ifnγr-/- mice, albeit at higher levels among the latter group, most likely due to the absence of feedback inhibition . the diminished neutrophil recruitment, while significant, was not as profound as that observed in mice subjected to complete blockade of ccl3-mediated signaling, in which we observed 104- <dig> fold-diminished neutrophil recruitment  <cit> . as might be anticipated from the diminished inflammatory response, we observe a statistically significant increase in virus titer among the ifnγr-/- mice , although this difference is likewise not as dramatic as that observed in response to complete blockade of ccl <dig> signaling.

receptor expression and responses of neutrophils from ifnγr gene-deleted mice
as part of an initial attempt to determine whether neutrophils from ifnγr -/- mice were capable of responding to ccl <dig>  we explored receptor expression and ligand-mediated calcium flux in neutrophils isolated from both gene-deleted and wild type mice. as shown in figure 3a, both wild type and ifnγr-/- neutrophils express transcripts encoding ccr <dig>  the major receptor for ccl3; no significant difference in absolute copy number was determined. likewise, ccl <dig> induced dose-dependent intracellular calcium flux in both gene-deleted and wild type neutrophils , demonstrating that neutrophils from ifnγr-/- mice have the innate capacity to respond to this chemoattractant ligand; the ec50s and maximum calcium fluxes detected were indistinguishable between the wild type and gene-deleted strains.

overexpression of ccl3
in order to examine the independent and interdependent contributions of ccl <dig> and ifnγ to the process of neutrophil recruitment in vivo, we generated a method for overexpression of ccl <dig> in vivo. ccl <dig> was detected in lung tissue homogenates , reaching levels similar to those detected in lung tissue of mice in response to pvm infection  <cit> . immunoreactive ccl <dig> was detected in bronchial epithelial cells . no ccl3-positive cells were detected in lung tissue from mice challenged with control vector  .

inflammatory responses to ifnγ and ccl3
we examined neutrophil recruitment in response to ccl <dig> overexpression in ifnγ gene-deleted mice  with and without ifnγ supplementation. as shown in figure 5a, few neutrophils are detected in bal fluid at baseline  and no recruitment over baseline is observed in response to ifnγ alone. likewise, overexpression of ccl <dig> in the absence of ifnγ does not elicit neutrophil recruitment. neutrophil recruitment  was observed in response to ccl <dig> expression only in the presence of ifnγ. at the microscopic level, no inflammation was observed in lung tissue of ifnγ -/- mice in response to ccl <dig> overexpression alone . in contrast, significant pathology was observed in lung tissue of ifnγ -/- mice expressing ccl <dig> and supplemented with exogenous ifnγ. findings include moderate peribronchiolar granulocytic infiltration and substantial parenchymal involvement but minimal edema fluid within the bronchioles and in the parenchymal tissue . interestingly, weight loss is sustained among the mice overexpressing ccl <dig> while receiving supplemental ifnγ over the  <dig> day examination period , but, despite the substantial inflammatory response, we observe no progression to respiratory failure up to and including t =  <dig> days.

discussion
in previous work, we demonstrated that the actions of the chemokine, ccl <dig>  signaling via its receptor ccr <dig>  were crucial for granulocyte recruitment to the lungs in response to pvm infection  <cit> ; ccl <dig> has also been shown to be a crucial mediator of granulocyte recruitment in mouse models of influenza  <cit> . paradoxically, ccl <dig> gene-deletion results in augmented neutrophil and eosinophil recruitment in response to cryptococcus neoformans infection  <cit> . here we show that ccl3-mediated neutrophil recruitment depends directly on ifnγ signaling, both in the setting of acute virus infection and in response to heterologous ccl <dig> expression in the respiratory epithelium.

granulocyte recruitment is a primary finding in severe respiratory virus infection; activation of granulocytes can result in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and proteolytic enzymes that can contribute to the ongoing lung damage  <cit> . interestingly, although neutrophils are recruited to the lung parenchyma in response to ccl <dig> via coordination by ifnγ, these cytokines alone clearly are not sufficient to induce the inflammatory state that ultimately promotes lung damage and respiratory failure. thus, despite our findings demonstrating improved survival from pvm infection with ccr <dig> blockade  <cit> , and those of he and colleagues  <cit> , who likewise demonstrated that ccr <dig> antagonism provided protection against neutrophil-mediated lung injury in a mouse model of acute pancreatitis, the results presented here, in which we observe neutrophil recruitment but minimal clinical disease, suggest that neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil activation are to some extent distinct and discrete signaling events. it will be crucial to identify the proinflammatory mediators that activate and well as those that recruit neutrophils in order to have a complete picture of the proinflammatory state characteristic of pvm infection.

the experimental studies performed in this manuscript utilize both ifnγ and ifnγr gene-deleted mice, which are in balb/c and c57bl/ <dig> background strains, respectively. pvm infection has been explored systematically in several inbred strains of mice by anh and colleagues  <cit>  who determined that the c57bl/ <dig> strain is somewhat more resistant to infection than balb/c, but that both of these inbred strains can ultimately succumb to the sequelae of severe disease. we have used both of these strains extensively for our studies  and both respond to pvm infection with robust virus replication in lung tissue, granulocyte recruitment and local production of proinflammatory cytokines, including ccl <dig> and ifnγ; no systematic differences, other than the aforementioned susceptibility to infection, have been detected.

both ccl <dig> and ifnγ have been detected in human studies and in mouse models of other severe respiratory virus infections, including avian influenza, sars coronavirus, and human respiratory syncytial virus  <cit> , although the potential for interplay between these specific signaling pathways has not been considered previously. our data suggest that that ifnγ and ccl <dig> signaling pathways, both crucial features of the response to pneumovirus infection, interact in a hierarchical fashion, as ifnγ does not elicit neutrophil recruitment on its own , but is crucial for ccl <dig> to function effectively. interactions between ifnγ and ccl <dig> may occur at the level of signal transduction, or via alterations to the neutrophil itself. as has been documented clearly, ccl <dig> can function alone to induce changes in calcium concentration and chemotactic responses in mouse neutrophils in vitro  <cit> . the current literature on interactions of ifnγ with granulocytes was recently reviewed  <cit> . among the possibilities that may address our findings, hansen and finbloom  <cit>  reported that human neutrophils express ifnγ receptors and bonecchi and colleagues  <cit>  have shown that human neutrophils respond to ifnγ with increased expression of a variety of mediators and receptors, including the primary ccl <dig> receptor, ccr <dig>  it is unclear whether mouse neutrophils respond in a similar fashion, and whether or not these defined molecular responses take place in vivo, although we have shown here that neutrophils from ifnγr gene-deleted mice express transcripts for ccr <dig> and mobilize intracellular calcium in response to ccl <dig> when examined ex vivo. we have not yet explored the possibility that the ifnγ coordinates neutrophil recruitment in response to ccl <dig> in a more indirect fashion, possibly via one or more intermediary cytokines. an example of this phenomenon was reported by khader and colleagues  <cit> , who demonstrated that mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected dendritic cells from il-12p <dig> gene-deleted mice that were unresponsive to a ccl <dig> gradient were also overproducing the cytokine il- <dig>  most intriguing, addition of il- <dig> to wild-type dendritic cells reproduced the inhibited chemotaxis response.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrate here that ccl <dig>  a proinflammatory mediator produced in response to rsv and shown to be a crucial in recruiting neutrophils in response to the mouse pneumovirus, pvm, functions via a hierarchical relationship with ifnγ. specifically, ccl <dig> recruits neutrophils to the lung in vivo only in coordination with ifnγ-mediated signaling pathways. the mechanism via which ifnγ modulates neutrophil responses to ccl <dig> is an intriguing subject for future exploration.
