BACKGROUND
hepatocellular carcinoma  is the major form of primary liver cancer  <cit> , and typically originates in a background of chronic inflammation caused by various factors, such as alcohol consumption, or viral infection   <cit> . inflammation is an essential part of the wound-healing response to those risk factors. however, chronic inflammation favors the accumulation of mutations and epigenetic aberrations in hepatocytes, thereby promoting malignant transformation  <cit> . this process is mediated by chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors secreted by the stromal components of the liver microenvironment  <cit> . among those secreted factors, the transforming growth factor beta  has been shown to have a key role that is cell-type dependent and variable during the hepatocarcinogenesis process  <cit> . in established hcc, tgf-β overexpression is associated with poor prognosis . however, characterization of the tumor cells targeted by tgf-β in hcc is still lacking.

as has been shown for other human malignancies, a subpopulation of cancer cells in hcc is known to display a higher tumorigenic potential . these so called tumor-initiating cells , are defined by their self-renewal and differentiation capacity, and have been isolated based on their expression of several cell markers   <cit> . of these, the surface marker cd133/prominin <dig> has been one of the most consistently reported. cd <dig> is a transmembrane protein whose function is only partially known  <cit> , but that may represent a marker of a distinct cell subpopulation with defined characteristics. the functional characterization of these cells will increase our understanding of the mechanisms involved in promoting and sustaining liver cancer progression.

several recent reports suggest a link between tgf-β signaling and liver tics. firstly, signaling pathways identified in liver cancer, including tgf-β, are active in isolated liver tics  <cit> . secondly, tgf-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition generates self-renewing cells, a process also implicated in a higher risk of tumor metastasis, as invasiveness and self-renewal are frequently shared features of stem cells, tics and metastatic cells  <cit> . finally, a recent study showed that tgf-β is able to induce the expression of cd <dig> in liver cancer cell lines together with an increased tumor initiating ability in mice  <cit> . together, these studies point towards a specific role for tgf-β in inducing a tic program in hcc.

dna methylation is able to stably modify the cell phenotype through cellular division  <cit> . because of the relative stability of dna methylation marks, dna methylation is a strong candidate mechanism to translate the presence of tgf-β in the cellular microenvironment into persistent changes in phenotype. however, there is still limited evidence of a link between exposure to components of the tumor microenvironment and the induction of stable changes in dna methylation in target cells.

in this study, we first defined the dna methylome profile of cd133-expressing liver cancer cells. we then tested the potential association between dna methylation and the induction of liver cd133+ cells by tgf-β. we show that tgf-β function in this context is intimately linked to a change in dna methylation profiles, and that this may represent a key process in the establishment of chronic exposure imprints in liver cancer cells.

RESULTS
cd133- and cd133+ liver cancer cells differentially express dna methylation genes
cd <dig> is an established marker of tics in different types of human malignancies, including hcc  <cit> . to test the notion that this marker distinguishes a cell subpopulation with a distinct dna methylation program, we characterized two non-related liver cancer cell lines. in a first step, we estimated the frequency of cd <dig> expressing cells in huh <dig> and hepg <dig> liver cancer cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting  against all common cd <dig> isoforms  <cit> . the expression of cd <dig> was evident in both cell lines, with a mean of 5%  in hepg <dig>  and 25%  in huh <dig> . expression of the surface protein positively correlated with cd <dig> expression at the mrna level . this low to moderate percentage of cells expressing cd <dig> contrasts with the extreme values of expression that we observed for other molecules such as cd <dig>  cd <dig> or epcam . importantly, expression of cd <dig> by facs has been tested at different time points throughout several years, in multiple conditions of cell passages and confluence.the relatively low variability on cd <dig> expression across time and conditions suggests a dynamic balance between cd133-expressing and non-expressing fractions in both cell lines.figure  <dig>

to serve as a basis for exploring a potentially different methylation program in cd133+ liver cancer cells, we studied the expression of genes coding for relevant players of the dna methylation machinery. this included genes involved in maintenance of dna methylation , de novo dna methylation  and dna demethylation . notably, dnmt3a was consistently and significantly overexpressed in both huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells progressively enriched for cd <dig> . in addition, dnmt3b was overexpressed in hepg <dig> cd133-enriched cells, while tet <dig> displayed opposite differential expression in cd133-enriched huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells . as noted above, the stable balance between the two cell fractions suggests no substantial difference in cell cycle rate between them. therefore, significant differences in expression, although modest in magnitude, are compatible with true functional differences between the two subpopulations.

together, these data suggests that cd <dig> positive and negative fractions grow in a constant proportion within liver cancer cell lines. they differentially express de novo dna methylation genes  and a subset of genes involved in stemness . functionally, expression of this marker has been associated with an increased tumor-initiating ability and ability to grow in non-attachment conditions, a well known surrogate measure of tic-like activity. we found that macs-sorted cd133+ huh7cells were able to form spheres under non-attachment conditions, in contrast to their cd133- counterpart . this was not the case with hepg <dig> cells, where no sphere formation was observed, possibly due to the lower enrichment of cd133+ cells that was attained using macs.

a differential dna methylome distinguishes cd133- and cd133+ liver cancer cells
the above results support the hypothesis of a phenotypic and functional distinction between cd133+ and cd133- cell fractions. cd133+ cells display a higher expression of de novo dnmts, and this may be reflected in a differential configuration of their dna methylome. to study this possibility, we performed a genome-wide dna methylome analysis in facs-sorted cd133- and cd133+ fractions from huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells . dna isolated from these fractions was interrogated with the illumina infinium hm <dig> bead array, which covers different genomic features of interest in addition to most human bona fide cpg islands  <cit> . we first performed unsupervised analyses and found that parental cell line was the main factor defining dna methylation variation. therefore, our main analysis compared cd133- to cd133+ fractions accounting for cell of origin . the class comparison analysis resulted in  <dig> differentially methylated probes  at significant p value , although relatively high fdrs , probably due to sample and cell line variations. therefore, for downstream data mining, we increased the stringency of the analyses by further filtering the significant list to keep only those cpg sites where the average differential methylation was at least 5% between the two groups in both cell lines. the resulting  <dig> differentially methylated probes correspond to  <dig> refseq genes, and represent those cpg sites significantly hypo or hypermethylated in cd133+ cells in both cell lines, relative to their negative counterpart . most of these probes  were hypomethylated in cd133+ cells, while  <dig>  were hypermethylated . an important proportion of differentially methylated loci  were not related to cpg islands  or their neighboring shelves and shores . for those probes matching annotated genes, we found a significant overrepresentation of differentially methylated loci in the body of the genes . this distribution relative to gene position and cpg island status was similar for hypomethylated sites, while hypermethylated sites were even more enriched in both, open sea  and gene body  probes . supporting the quality of the dataset was the finding of one cpg site within the cd <dig>  locus among this list of differentially methylated sites. this cpg site was hypomethylated in cd133+ subpopulations from both cell lines, by  <dig> % and 8% in huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells, respectively .figure  <dig>

after having identified differentially methylated cpgs and the genes associated with these sites, we next aimed to identify the pathways that are specifically altered in cd133+ cells. to this end, we performed pathway analysis considering methylome profiles of both cell lines together or independently. notably, in both cases there was enrichment in pathways previously associated with tumor initiating cell activity, such as jak-stat, notch, wnt and akt . other pathways included actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, and cell adhesion. in addition, there was a significant overrepresentation of inflammatory pathways, such as nfkb, p <dig>  tnf, and tgf-β signaling pathways.

in summary, our data shows that cd133+ and cd133- liver cancer cells display a different dna methylome. in spite of the cell line specific profiles, the data suggests a common cd133+ methylome signature, which includes the prom <dig> gene itself. in addition, the methylome of cd133+ cells is characterized by a global reduction in dna methylation relative to their cd133- counterpart, with an overrepresentation of non-cgi cpg sites. for those differentially methylated sites related to annotated genes , there was an association with tic- and inflammation-related pathways. these findings suggest that specific dna methylation profiles are associated to the phenotype and functionality of these cell subpopulations.

tgf-β, but not il- <dig>  induces cd <dig> expression in a stable fashion
it has been reported that tgf-β exposure increases the percentage of cd133+ cells in the huh <dig> cell line  <cit> , although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. we thus aimed to investigate whether this observation is consistent in two independent cell lines and compatible with an epigenetic mechanism . importantly, both huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells, express the receptor for tgf-β  at similar levels, and respond to tgf-β by phosphorylating the receptor-dependent smad <dig> . in addition to tgf-β, we performed a set of parallel experiments with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin  <dig> , which has also been associated with hcc risk  <cit> . to this end, we selected commonly used cytokine concentrations that induced morphological changes after  <dig> days of treatment in both cell lines , but did not have any effect on cell viability . as expected, tgf-β exposure during  <dig> days induced a two-fold increase in the percentage of cd133+ cells in huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells . interestingly, il- <dig> treatment also induced an increase in cd <dig> positivity in both cell lines, although the increase was comparatively mild  . next, we analyzed the persistence of the effect in cd <dig> expression induced by both cytokines. to this end, we treated both cell lines as in the previous experiment. after  <dig> days, cell culture medium was replaced by standard medium, and cells were left in culture for additional  <dig> days. cells were collected and screened for cd <dig> expression using facs. notably, only cells treated with tgf-β showed a persistent increase in the percentage of cd133+ cells, of similar magnitude to the increase observed at day  <dig> . importantly, only tgf-β exposure was able to induce a significant increase in the expression of cd <dig> at the transcriptional level in both cell lines  .figure  <dig> 
tgf-β, but not il- <dig>  induces cd <dig> expression in a stable fashion. a. experimental design is indicated in the upper panel. huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells were grown in control culture conditions , or exposed to  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig>  or  <dig> ng/ml tgf-β  for  <dig> days. cells plated in parallel, had their medium replaced by control culture medium and were left in culture for additional  <dig> days. facs expression of surface cd <dig> protein is shown for day  <dig>  day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  for all conditions, in logarithmic scale. histograms are shown for one representative replicate in the middle panel. mean +/- sd is shown for three biological replicates in the lower panel barplots. b. tgf-β type i receptor antagonist sb  <dig> was used at 2um, alone or in combination with  <dig> ng/ml of tgf-β, and dmso used as control. cd <dig> expression was studied by facs after  <dig> consecutive days of exposure to each experimental condition.  indicates p value <  <dig>  relative to all other conditions, for both cell lines. representative phase contrast images are shown in the lower panels.



tgf-β is a member of a large family of pleiotropic cytokines that signal through a receptor complex comprising a diversity of type i and type ii serine/threonine kinases. the recombinant tgf-β <dig> used in our assays is expected to bind the activin receptor-like kinase  <dig>   <cit> . to rule out unspecific effects of this treatment, we used the small molecule inhibitor sb- <dig>  which targets alk <dig> and alk5-related type i receptors, with no effect on other family members that, for example, recognize bone morphogenetic proteins   <cit> . by using this specific inhibitor of tgf-β pathway, we were able to abrogate the effect of tgf-β in inducing cd <dig> expression  in both cell lines . therefore, the ability to induce cd133+ cells is specific and fully dependent on tgf-β type i receptor signaling in both, huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells .

together, these findings suggest that tgf-β is able to specifically and stably induce cd <dig> expression , an observation consistent with epigenetically-induced phenotype persistence.

de novo induction of cd <dig> by tgf-β is associated to an increased expression of dnmt <dig> genes
the increase in cd <dig> positivity induced by tgf-β can be explained by a switch in the expression of cd <dig>  or an increased rate of growth specifically in the smaller cd133+ fraction of cells. to distinguish between these two possibilities, we repeated the previous experiment in cells negative for cd <dig> expression, selected by depletion of cd133+ cells using macs . in both cell lines, tgf-β was able to significantly induce a population of cd133+ cells, evident after  <dig> days of treatment . also in this case, we replaced the medium after  <dig> days, and let the cells grow in the absence of cytokines for additional  <dig> days. after these additional  <dig> days, the increase in cd <dig> positive fraction was higher, relative to the one observed at day  <dig>  for both cell lines . importantly, although there was a spontaneous induction of a cd133+ fraction in huh <dig> cells , this percentage did not significantly change at day  <dig>  and is similar to what is found in untreated huh <dig> cells in basal conditions. as discussed above, this suggests a dynamic balance between the cd <dig> negative and positive fractions in this cell line. the surface expression of cd <dig> remained close to zero in hepg <dig> control cells. this finding suggests that tgf-β is able to induce the expression of cd <dig> surface protein, and not an increased proliferation of cd133+ cells. this is also supported by the expected lower rate of proliferation of cells treated with tgf-β . similar to our previous experiment, under these conditions il <dig> only showed a transient effect .figure  <dig> 
de novo cd <dig> induction by tgf-β correlates with overexpression of dnmt <dig> genes. a. the experiment in figure 3a was repeated after macs-sorting to enrich in cd <dig> negative cells, as depicted in the upper panel. levels of cd <dig> expression were close to 0%, as shown in the upper histograms for both, huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells. mean from three replicates is shown in the lower panels.  indicates p value <  <dig>  relative to control conditions. b. sphere formation assays were performed in non-attachment plates, after exposure to tgf-β during  <dig> days. spheres were counted after  <dig> days of growth in hepatosphere medium w/o tgf-β. c. huh <dig>  and hepg <dig>  cells were treated as in , rna was extracted and qrt-pcr was performed for genes involved in dna methylation or demethylation. expression was normalized to housekeeping gene gapdh.  indicates p value <  <dig>  relative to non-treated cells at the corresponding time point.



after having shown that tgf-β may be able to induce a de novo fraction of cd133+ cells, we asked whether this effect correlated with a differential expression of dna methylation players, as we have shown that cd133+ cells overexpress dnmt <dig> genes in basal culture conditions . dnmts and tet <dig> displayed a significant increase in mrna expression in at least one of the two cell lines, while tet <dig> was underexpressed after  <dig> days of release from tgf-β exposure . as shown for the basal cd133-expressing cells , the most consistent finding was the statistically significant overexpression of dnmt3a in both cell lines after tgf-β treatment. of note, in none of the conditions of study was il- <dig> exposure able to induce statistically significant changes at the mrna expression level of genes related to dna methylation/demethylation .combined, these data shows the ability of tgf-β  to induce a stable de novo fraction of cd133-expressing cells in two independent liver cancer cell lines. this induction correlates with a functional characteristic of basal cd133+ cells, which is the increased ability to grow under non-attachment cell culture conditions . moreover, the persistence of cd <dig> induction by tgf-β  suggests an epigenetic process is taking place, in contrast to the transient induction of cd <dig> by il- <dig> 

cell subpopulation switch induced by tgf-β correlates with a differential dna methylome
having shown that cd133+ cells display a unique dna methylome, and that tgf-β is able to induce a de novo cd133+ fraction of cells, we decided to study the dna methylome induced by tgf-β exposure. to this end, we used hm <dig> bead arrays to interrogate dna methylation changes induced by  <dig> days of tgf-β exposure in both, huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells . in addition, to define the epigenetic persistence of tgf-β effects, we included the dna from cells released  <dig> days into normal cell culture medium after the tgf-β treatment. as described above for the dna methylation profile of cd133-expressing cells, the methylome of huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells are clearly distinguishable, independently of the experimental conditions. however, in addition to cell type-specific changes we were able to observe genome-wide changes induced by tgf-β in a cell type-independent fashion. to define a tgf-β-induced dna methylation signature, we focused on those loci that were significantly hypo or hypermethylated in both cell lines. in addition, we were interested in those changes that were persistent through cell division and stable in the absence of tgf-β. therefore, we selected significant loci  that were differentially methylated at both,  <dig> days of treatment and  <dig> additional days after release. finally, we selected those cpg sites that reached an average difference of at least 10% between control and tgf-β conditions .  <dig> differentially methylated positions  fulfill all criteria, with  <dig> hypomethylated after tgf-β exposure  and a great majority hypermethylated  , including multiple sites on intergenic regions. hypermethylated dmps included loci in trrap, col1a <dig>  dnah <dig>  arid1b, onecut <dig>  and dnmt3b. hypomethylated dmps included loci in tgfb <dig>  bmp <dig>  irak <dig>  and foxk <dig>  interestingly, there was an enrichment of dmps on enhancer regions . in addition, we found a significantly lower gc content in dmps when compared to a random selection of probes or to the overall gc content of hm <dig> probes . to study the genomic context in more detail we analyzed the overlap of dmps with genomic features, as previously described  <cit> . these annotations consider the relationship with cpg islands   and the location with respect to the gene . an important proportion of probes in hm <dig> bead arrays target proximal promoter cgis and shores, and non-cgi gene bodies . a similar distribution is observed when overlapping a randomly generated list of sites  with the genomic features. however, there is a striking under-representation of promoter cgis and shores in the dmp list . instead, a great majority of dmps are found within the gene bodies in non-cgi regions, in agreement with our previous observation of low gc content .figure  <dig> 
cell subpopulation imbalance induced by tgfβ correlates with a methylome reconfiguration. a. huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells were treated with tgf-β for  <dig> days, or 4 +  <dig> days post-release, as described above. biological triplicates were used to assess dna methylation changes with hm <dig> arrays. b. heatmap represents probes differentially methylated  with a delta-beta of at least 20%  between control and tgf-β treated cells, in both cell lines, and both time points. for a full list of dmps  see table s <dig>  blue indicates lower methylation, and red indicates higher methylation. the unsupervised clustering distinguishes tgf-β from control conditions regardless of cell line or time of exposure. c.  <dig> dmps  were mapped to known enhancer regions in the human hg <dig> genome assembly. enrichment is observed in dmps, relative to a random selection of the same number of probes and the total of hm <dig> probes mapping to an enhancer . d. in similar way, gc content was compared between dmps, random probes, and all hm <dig> probes .  indicates a significantly lower gc content in dmps relative to any of the other probe lists. e. dmps were distributed according to their relationship to cpg islands  or genes , as described in materials and methods. f. a selection of significant loci were validated by pyrosequencing , in both cell lines.  indicates p value <  <dig>  relative to non-treated cells at the corresponding time point and cell line. il- <dig> was included for comparison.



next, we searched for differentially methylated regions  in response to tgf-β, and common to both cell lines. we used as criteria for dmr the presence of at least two neighboring dmps within a minimum gap of 100bp at a significant fdr <  <dig> . using these criteria we obtained  <dig> dmrs, oscillating from  <dig> to  <dig> dmps on each . interestingly, one of these dmrs is comprised of  <dig> cpg sites corresponding to the body of the dnmt3b gene. indeed, the majority of dmrs  were found outside of gene promoters. dmps in dnmt3b and trrap were validated using an independent quantitative method, bisulfite dna pyrosequencing . both assays confirmed hypermethylation in response to  <dig> days of tgf-β and  <dig> days after release, in the two cell lines. in contrast, no differential methylation was observed in pyrosequencing assays performed on dnmt3a and tet <dig> in response to tgf-β, although increased methylation at the dnmt3a locus was observed after il- <dig> exposure in hepg <dig> cells .table  <dig>

to gain a better insight on the consequences of tgf-β-induced methylome switch on the phenotype, we performed a whole genome expression analysis in both, huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells. we chose the 8-days time point , considered in our model as the one defining long-term, stable changes induced by this cytokine. expression analysis showed an expected profile of gene expression in both cell lines, including known tgf-β targets . in addition, “type i transforming growth factor beta receptor binding” was the first gene ontology category at the molecular function level . however, when intersecting the expression  and methylation  significant gene lists, there was no significant overlap. as the effect of a specific methylation change on gene transcription is known to depend on the genomic location  <cit> , we plotted all expression and methylation data, and analyzed separately cpg island and non-cpg island sites. as expected, no obvious correlation can be seen when plotting simultaneously all genes, independently of genomic location. however, hypermethylation within the gene bodies positively correlated with gene expression . in addition, we observed a small but significant overlap of  <dig> genes when intersecting the cd <dig> and the tgf-β methylation signatures .

our data shows that the effect of tgf-β in liver cancer cell lines comes along with a remarkable switch of the dna methylome at multiple loci. this reconfiguration is stable and common to two independent cell lines, and affects a significant proportion of enhancer regions and gc poor regions on gene bodies, which in some cases correlates positively with gene expression. the tgf-β “methyl-sensitive” signature described here includes dna methylation players themselves and a number of tgf-β pathway loci, indicating a potential role for dna methylation in establishing a tgf-β-induced phenotype switch in these cells. these results suggest that basal cd133+ cells and tgf-β-induced cd133+ cells only share a limited subset of their methylome. an important fraction of tgf-β methyl-sensitive cpg sites are not differentially methylated in cd133+ cells.

kinetics of dna methylation changes at tgf-β methyl-sensitive sites
our methylome analyses have defined a subset of dna sites differentially methylated in response to tgf-β exposure in a stable and cell line-independent fashion. we performed two independent experiments to monitor the dynamics of these dna methylation changes induced by tgf-β. first, we studied how early after tgf-β stimulation we were able to observe methylation differences. to this end, we extracted dna every 24h during  <dig> consecutive days in tgf-β treated and control cells grown in parallel. specifically, we studied the methylation of one cpg site in the gene body of trrap, selected from our list of significant hits as a representative of the pattern most consistently observed in our dataset: differential methylation of single sites  in the body of the genes. basal methylation of trrap was relatively stable within this experiment . in contrast, trrap methylation is significantly increased as early as  <dig> day in hepg <dig> cells and  <dig> days in huh <dig> cells after tgf-β exposure. this difference remains constant up to the 4th day of tgf-β treatment in both cell lines.figure  <dig> 
kinetics of dna methylation after tgf-β treatment. a. huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells were exposed to tgf-β for shorter time points , followed by dna extraction, bisulfite modification, and pyrosequencing analysis of one cpg site in the body of trrap gene . b. in a similar way, both cell lines were studied at longer time points after release from  <dig> days of tgf-β treatment. cells were followed during  <dig> days post-release and displayed a rate of proliferation close to non-treated cells.  indicates p value <  <dig>  relative to non-treated cells at the corresponding time point and cell line.



in the second experiment we aimed to assess the stability of the methylation changes at longer time points. to this end, cells were treated with tgf-β during  <dig> consecutive days . after this time cell culture medium was replaced by standard medium, and control and treated cells were followed for dna extraction every  <dig> days until day  <dig> . first, we observed differences on the basal methylation of trrap when comparing to the previous experiments, especially in huh <dig> cells . this could be the result of differences on the efficiency of bisulfite conversion between experiments, but also differences between cell lines from various origins, as the huh <dig> cells used for the second experiment were obtained from an independent laboratory. regardless of basal difference, we observed that the increased methylation of trrap was replicated in both cell lines. furthermore, significantly higher methylation levels persisted up to  <dig> days post-release from tgf-β, with no apparent change in its magnitude. importantly, cell growth was not significantly affected after tgf-β release, and we estimate that at least  <dig> cell duplications took place during this time.

in summary, dna methylation changes in a typical tgf-β methyl-sensitive locus in the trrap gene body can be observed as early as 1- <dig> days following tgf-β exposure, and persist through cell division for at least  <dig> days without apparent change in magnitude.

silencing of de novo dna methyl-transferases impair the effect of tgf-β at methyl-sensitive sites
to have an insight into the causal role of dna methylation on the cancer cell population switch induced by tgf-β, we performed an sirna experiment to silence de novo dna methyl-transferases in the context of tgf-β exposure in hepg <dig> cells using a pool of sirnas . the main readout of our experiment was the ability of tgf-β to induce a 2- to 3-fold change in the expression of cd <dig> by facs analysis of hepg <dig> cells . considering that the previous kinetics experiment showed trrap hypermethylation at  <dig> days post- tgf-β treatment, we started treatment with tgf-β 24h post-transfection and collected dna two days later . sirna efficiency checked by qrt-pcr  showed an effect of both sirnas when used alone or in combination, although sirna against dnmt3b displayed a better efficacy of silencing the corresponding transcript. transfection with a non-targeting sirna did not affect the morphology of hepg <dig> cells, typically growing as refractive, well-delimited colonies . the expected response to tgf-β was also not affected by the non-targeting sirna, with the expected loss of the refractive colonies and the presence of flattened enlarged cells. transfection with dnmt3a or dnmt3b sirnas, or combination of both did not have any effect on cell morphology. however, in contrast to the non-targeting control, there was no response to tgf-β exposure and most cells remained as refractive colonies in all other conditions without significant loss of cell viability . similarly, non-targeting sirna did not influence the expected increase in cd133+ expression by facs  . there was no effect of sirna against dnmt3s alone or in combination on the basal expression of cd <dig>  however, the response to tgf-β was significantly impaired in all conditions . therefore, the morphological “rescue” was paralleled by the cd <dig> phenotype.figure  <dig> 
silencing of dnmt3s impairs the effects of tgf-β on liver cancer cells. a. hepg <dig> cells were transfected with 20nm of a non-targeting sirna, or a pool of sirnas against dnmt3a, dnmt3b, or a combination of both. one day after transfection cell medium was replaced by standard culture medium or medium containing 10nm tgf-β for each condition. two days after treatment with tgf-β cells were collected from all conditions for morphological evaluation, cd <dig> facs expression analysis, rna and dna extraction. all transfections were performed in triplicate wells. b. qrt-pcr was performed to assess the efficiency and specificity of the transfections. higher efficiency was obtained with sirna against dnmt3b alone or in combination with dnmt3a. c. representative phase contrast images for all conditions . d. cells were collected after treatment and processed immediately for analysis of cd <dig> surface expression using facs. secondary antibody staining  is shown as control in the top panel, and was used as a reference for the gates shown below. the plots show one representative histogram for each condition, and the corresponding percentage of cd133+ cells . e. mean + sem for cd <dig> facs expression in triplicates of each condition. a non-transfected control was also included in this analysis. asterisks depict the significance between control and tgf-β -treated cells transfected with non-targeting sirna, and all other tgf-β -treated conditions compared to non-targeting tgf-β -treated cells. f. dna was extracted and bisulfite modified for pyrosequencing of trrap.  indicates p value <  <dig>  relative to non-treated cells within each experimental condition.



finally, we tested if, under the same conditions, dna methylation changes in response to tgf-β were also impaired after dnmt <dig> silencing. trrap methylation is induced after  <dig> days of tgf-β treatment in hepg <dig> cells, an effect not influenced by the transfection of a non-targeting sirna . however, all further experimental conditions significantly reduce trrap methylation in the absence of tgf-β. in addition, the hypermethylation induced by tgf-β exposure was impaired, especially after transfection with sirna against dnmt3b. together, these results suggest that de novo dna methyl-transferases are involved in the effect of tgf-β at different levels: morphology, distribution of cell subpopulations, and dna methylation. the hypomethylation observed in absence of tgf-β also suggests a role for dnmt3a and dnmt3b in maintenance of dna methylation at the trrap locus.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present report, we comprehensively describe the dna methylome of cd133+ and cd133- liver cancer cells. we used two non-related hcc cell lines to isolate pure populations of cd133- and cd133+ cells for dna methylome assays. as has been previously reported, cd133+ cells isolated from liver cancer cell lines , are functionally distinct cells with increased ability to induce tumors in animal models  <cit> . these findings are in line with clinical studies reporting poor prognosis for those hcc cases displaying higher proportions of cd133-expressing cells. although testing the tumor-initiating or metastasis-initiating ability of cd133+ cells was beyond the scope of our study, our results suggest that these cells display a differential dna methylation signature. whether dna methylation is fundamental in establishing the cellular programs defining the main characteristics of these cells should be the focus of future studies.

recently, the prognostic implications of tgf-β pathway activation in hcc have been linked to the ability of this signaling pathway to induce metastatic behavior in a fraction of hcc cells  <cit> . an additional link between liver tics and tgf-β in hcc has been the recent demonstration that tgf-β is able to increase the proportion of cd133+ cells in vitro  <cit> . here, we were able to reproduce and extend those previous observations. we showed that tgf-β is able to increase cd <dig> expression at the protein and mrna level in two non-related hcc cell lines. the effect induced by tgf-β is stable, as opposed to the transient effect of the proinflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  we show that this effect depends on specific signaling through tgf-β type i receptor and is independent of increased cell proliferation of cd133+ cells. by using cd133-depleted cellular fractions, we suggest that tgf-β is able to induce de novo expression of cd <dig>  furthermore, this induction of cd <dig> cells correlates with an increased ability to grow in non-attachment conditions, a surrogate functional assay for stem/tic properties.

both, basal cd133-expressing cells and tgf-β-induced cd133+ cells, expressed increased levels of the de novo dna methylation transcripts, dnmt3a and dnmt3b. this led us to further explore the ability of tgf-β to induce dna methylation changes at the genome-wide level. we were able to show cell line-independent changes in dna methylation induced by tgf-β in a stable fashion, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism involved in the establishment of a cellular program. the methylome of tgf-β -treated cells only partially overlapped with the methylome of cd133+ cells in basal conditions. this suggests that tgf-β may not only induce cd <dig> expression , but also a defined dna methylation profile. further studies at longer time points and analyses of isolated cd <dig> negative and positive cells may shed light on the ability of tgf-β to imprint a dna methylation signature independently of the induction of cd <dig> expression.

notably, although tgf-β is known to induce dna methylation changes at discrete loci , little evidence existed to date of a genome-wide level of tgf-β-methyl-sensitive loci. specifically, several previous reports were focused on chromatin changes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition . emt is a developmental process that involves actin cytoskeleton reorganization and loss of apical–basal polarity and cell-to-cell contact, and like other developmental processes it involves epigenetic reprogramming  <cit> . however, both at physiological and pathological levels, emt has been mainly linked to widespread changes of histone marks or histone modifiers, in addition to the well-known role of defined transcription factors . interestingly, gene-specific changes in dna methylation have been correlated with the ability to maintain epigenetic silencing of critical emt genes  <cit> . in this sense, it has been suggested that dna methylation is involved in the process of fixing the switch between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. in our conditions, tgf-β induced a loss of e-cadherin expression in both cell lines, but not an evident increase in n-cadherin, which is a known marker of emt . however, our results are consistent with a model of persistent changes in dna methylation induced by tgf-β. indeed, our experimental design was intended to reproduce an epigenetic process, by selecting only those changes in dna methylation that survived cell division. whether this effect of tgf-β is specific of transformed cells will require further studies.

regardless of considerations on the targeted cells or the effect of the cell cycle or cell subtypes, we describe what seems to be a unique pattern of differential methylation. our tgf-β signature  was characterized by a reduced gc content, and enrichment at enhancer regions. moreover, the under-representation of promoter cgis and enrichment on gene bodies , may indicate specific mechanisms of gene regulation through dna methylation. for example, changes in dna methylation on these tgf-β methyl-sensitive loci may drive differential enhancer activity or alternative transcriptional events, as has been suggested in other contexts  <cit> . whether similar findings occur in response to other cytokines is not currently known.

in summary, our data support and reinforce several previous studies that have pointed to an association between tics, and tgf-β. in addition, we provide a mechanistic insight into the process that may lead to the stable change in cancer cell subpopulations. our study demonstrates that a key cytokine involved in hcc progression, tgf-β, is able to epigenetically induce a dynamic imbalance between cell subpopulations. the results reported here are in agreement with a model in which dna methylation plays a pivotal role in establishing the cellular program of liver cancer cell subpopulations. the dynamics of a related process has recently been shown for cd44+ breast cancer stem cells  <cit> . however, in our model, the effect of tgf-β is persistent  and therefore epigenetically acquired. motivated by these observations, the mechanistic evidence of an active interplay between tgf-β and the dna methylation machinery should be an exciting focus of future studies.
