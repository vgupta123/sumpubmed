BACKGROUND
teleostei is the most numerous and diversified group of vertebrates. among them, the order perciformes is widely distributed throughout the world and is the most diversified of all fish orders. perciformes are also evolutionarily interesting, because the order includes fish species with various features and forms. however, there is insufficient genomic information for the fishes in this order to allow analyses of chromosomal evolution and the identification of important trait loci for breeding. yellowtail , a member of the order perciformes, is a popular and important species in japanese aquaculture. in this study, we report the results of transcriptome analysis, including single nucleotide polymorphism  identification.

sequencing of expressed sequence tags  derived from cdna libraries is considered a useful method to identify transcripts in species that lack a sequenced genome  <cit> . however, obtaining a high-quality est database using sanger’s sequencing method is time consuming and expensive. consequently, this method has been restricted to a few aquaculture fishes, such as atlantic salmon  <cit>  rainbow trout  <cit> , and catfish  <cit> . recently, next generation sequencing, e.g. illumina sequencing, has been developed and has allowed transcriptome analysis in aquaculture fish species, such as catfish  <cit> , silver carp  <cit> , and large yellow croaker  <cit> , and has permitted the identification of gene-associated markers in catfish  <cit> , carp  <cit>  and rainbow trout  <cit> . the parallel pyrosequencing technology, commercialized by  <dig> pyrosequencing, is another next generation sequencing technology and has been used to identify gene-associated snps derived from ests, e.g. in the blunt snout bream  <cit> , lake whitefish  <cit> , cutthroat trout  <cit> , atlantic herring  <cit>  and atlantic cod  <cit> . we developed this pyrosequencing technology to find snps in the transciptomes of yellowtail. snps in coding regions are one of the most important dna variants for quantitative trait locus  mapping, because some mendelian and genetically complex traits are caused by snps in coding regions  <cit> .

physical and linkage maps are important aids in the assembly of genome sequences, for comparative analysis of synteny and for identifying candidate genes by qtl analysis. high-resolution linkage maps have been constructed for various fishes, such as medaka, zebrafish, atlantic salmon  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit> , asian seabass  <cit> , catfish  <cit> , atlantic cod  <cit> , pufferfish   <cit>  and carp  <cit> . in genetic studies of seriola, the first linkage map between s. quinqueradiata and s. lalandi was produced by ohara et al.  <cit> . recently, the linkage map has been improved by the addition of more simple sequence repeat  markers, derived from bacterial artificial chromosome  end sequences  <cit> . in this study, a second generation linkage map was produced, represented by  <dig> linkage groups and having  <dig> snp markers.

moreover, we report the construction of a second generation radiation hybrid  map. an rh map is a powerful tool for building a physical map of the whole genome, and can be used to aid the construction of gene orthology relationships through conserved synteny analysis. seven rh maps have been reported in six teleost fishes, including two maps of zebrafish  <cit> , gilthead sea bream  <cit> , medaka  <cit> , european sea bass  <cit> , nile tilapia  <cit>  and yellowtail  <cit> . the second generation rh map of yellowtail has more than  <dig>  markers and will be useful for genome sequence assembly and comparative analysis of synteny. the release of the complete genome information of the model fish species medaka , zebrafish , green-spotted puffierfish , and three-spined stickleback  has accelerated the evolutionary studies. finally, we performed synteny analysis to compare yellowtail with model fish species.

RESULTS
de novo transcriptome assembly
a cdna library was generated from pooled rna samples extracted from  <dig> tissues from a single individual. sequencing on the roche/ <dig> gs flx titanium platform generated  <dig> , <dig> reads. the clc genomic workbench carried out the de novo assembly. after trimming the adapters and filtering out the low-quality and short reads,  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs, with  <dig>  reads remaining as singletons. the average length of the contigs was  <dig> bp, and the n <dig> size was  <dig> bp.

gene ontology analysis
of  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>   had a significant hit and matched  <dig>  unique protein records in the nr protein database. gene ontology  analysis was conducted on these  <dig>  contigs.  <dig>  sequences were assigned to at least one go term describing three functional groups: biological process, molecular function and cellular component. summaries of the level  <dig> go assignments are shown in figure  <dig>  among the  <dig>  sequences, the molecular function ontology comprised the majority of go assignments , followed by biological processes  and cellular components . in the molecular function category, binding and catalytic activity represented about 80% of the total. for biological processes, sequences involved in cellular processes , metabolic processes , and biological regulation  were highly represented. finally, the cell and organelle term represented about 70% of the cellular component. transcriptome assembly using next generation dna sequencing and go analysis has been reported in other fish species  <cit> . our go analysis of yellowtail transcriptome revealed similar results to those of other fishes.figure  <dig> gene ontology assignment for assembled contigs.  molecular function,  biological process and  cellular component assignment.



snp identification
sequencing produced  <dig>  raw reads derived from the full-length library and  <dig>  raw reads derived from the 3′-anchored library. quality-based variant calling using the clc genomics workbench detected  <dig>  biallelic putative snps in  <dig>  contigs, with a minor allele frequency  ≥25%. snps with a high allele frequency are more suited for constructing a linkage map efficiently using genotyping of one family because polymorphisms of snps decrease in one family. these contigs were registered to ddbj/embl/genbank as accession number fx884179–fx <dig> 

mapping of snp markers to the linkage map
direct sequencing identified  <dig> informative snps that were heterozygous in either one of the parents, and these heterozygous snps were used for linkage analysis using the f <dig> mapping progeny. in the snptype assay,  <dig> snps were mapped to the linkage map .  <dig> markers containing  <dig> snps, which were polymorphic in the f <dig> mapping progeny, were mapped in the linkage map, and  <dig> markers were common for both sexes. in this study, snps were mapped for the first time in a yellowtail linkage map.table  <dig>

in our genotyping analysis, many polymorphisms in wild yellowtail were observed; however, using one family decreased the snp frequency to about 10%. moreover, we used a nanofluidic dynamic array to perform high-throughput genotyping against targeted snps. we considered that the nanofluidic dynamic array was useful to genotype snps in one family, as well as sequencing analysis by sanger’s method.

construction of the rh map
pcr on a dynamic array produces high-throughput gene expression data that are essentially identical in quality to conventional microliter qrt-pcr and are superior to publicly available array data from the same tissue type  <cit> . in our previous study,  <dig> markers were mapped in the first rh map  <cit> .  <dig>  markers, containing the previous  <dig> markers, were used to construct the rh map. the two-point analysis, performed at a lod score of  <dig>  and a distance threshold of  <dig>  resulted in  <dig> groups using carthagene software  <cit> . furthermore, with reference to the locations of several markers on the constructed genetic linkage map,  <dig>  markers  were distributed to  <dig> linkage groups . thirty-one markers in eight groups were not distributed among the genetic linkage groups because of their lod score or a distance threshold error. the rh map was constructed with a final set of  <dig>  markers. in each group, the rh map ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . <dig> centirays , with an average of approximately  <dig>  cr. the combined size of all rh groups was  <dig> . <dig> cr. the estimated size of the yellowtail genome is  <dig> mbp  <cit> , which inferred a value of  <dig> cr =  <dig> kbp . we have obtained a large quantity of data in a short time using the biomark™ hd system since the construction of the first rh map.table  <dig>

summary of the markers of the rh map




the rh map was compared with the linkage map to confirm the accuracy of the local order of markers . in linkage group  <dig> of mapped to  <dig> cm, because chromosome recombination is unlikely to occur during meiosis. it is possible to map these genes accurately on the physical map using rh. the position of some markers was different between the rh and linkage maps, because the physical lengths of the rh map are different from the genetic lengths of the linkage map. in addition, we supposed which region of the rh map is not recombined at meiosis by comparing the rh and the linkage map. the accuracy of the local order of markers will be confirmed when the whole genome sequence becomes available. currently, we are trying to map genome contigs of yellowtail onto the physical map.

synteny relationship with model fish
the  <dig>  yellowtail est marker sequences of the rh map were compared with the cdna sequences of four fish species: medaka , zebrafish , three-spined stickleback  and green-spotted pufferfish  using the tblastx algorithm. among the  <dig>  yellowtail marker sequences,  <dig>  genes  had homologs in medaka,  <dig>  genes  had homologs in zebrafish,  <dig>  genes  had homologs in three-spined stickleback, and  <dig>  genes  had homologs in green-spotted pufferfish . these values were not significantly different among the four fishes. oxford grids between yellowtail and the four fish species are shown in figure  <dig>  the modal number of chromosomes in yellowtail is  <dig>  <cit> . this number is the same as that of medaka; all chromosomes could be paired one-to-one between yellowtail and medaka. the number of chromosomes in the two fishes is the same and their chromosomal structures are similar. these results suggested that we would observe conserved synteny between yellowtail and medaka, and that the syntenic relationship between yellowtail and zebrafish would be rather low. however, they might not be evolutionarily closer than the relationships between yellowtail and medaka. medakas are a member of the order beloniformes, which includes freshwater and marine fish, such as pacific saury and flying fish. zebrafish are a member of cypriniformes, which consists exclusively of freshwater fish. our synteny results reflected the known taxonomic relationships of these fishes. in teleostei, it is thought that a whole genome duplication and eight subsequent major rearrangements occurred about 314– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . moreover, medaka and zebrafish are thought to have diverged after the eight major rearrangement events, after which medaka and green-spotted pufferfish diverged. the chromosome number in three-spined sticklebacks is the same as that of green-spotted pufferfish. furthermore, the oxford grid between yellowtail and green-spotted pufferfish was similar to that between yellowtail and three-spined sticklebacks . however, in the oxford grid between green-spotted pufferfish and three-spined sticklebacks, the chromosome groups were not paired one-to-one . yellowtail sq <dig> and  <dig> correspond to linkage group  <dig> of three-spined sticklebacks, sq <dig> and  <dig> correspond to linkage group  <dig>  and sq <dig> and  <dig> correspond to linkage group  <dig>  respectively. then, yellowtail sq <dig> and  <dig> correspond to chromosome  <dig> of green-spotted pufferfish, sq <dig> and  <dig> correspond to chromosome  <dig>  and sq <dig> and  <dig> correspond to chromosome  <dig>  respectively. these chromosomes in three-spined sticklebacks and green-spotted pufferfish could be paired one-to-two with those of yellowtail. the number of chromosomes in three-spined sticklebacks and green-spotted pufferfish is n= <dig> and that of yellowtail is n= <dig>  thus, three-spined sticklebacks and green-spotted pufferfish have three fewer chromosomes than yellowtail; each chromosome is thought to have merged after the divergence from medaka about  <dig>  m years ago. by analysis of the whole genome sequence, conserved segments and/or conserved segment orders will be distinguished using the rh map, and will aid studies of the dynamics of chromosome evolution between yellowtail and model fish species.figure  <dig> oxford grids showing conservation of synteny between yellowtail and four model fish. a: medaka, b: zebrafish, c: three-spined stickleback, d: green spotted pufferfish. each box is highlighted as follows: 0–4: white square, 5–10: yellow square, 11–20: green square, 21–30: sky blue square, 31–40: blue square, more than 40: dark blue square.



a putative sex determination locus of yellowtail was located in the squ <dig> linkage group  <cit> ; however, its related gene has not been identified. the sex determination gene in fish varies according to fish species: dmy in medaka  <cit> , amhy in patagonian pejerrey  <cit> , amhr <dig> in fugu  <cit>  and sdy in the rainbow trout  <cit> . therefore, the identification of sex determination genes is difficult, especially when the conservation of these loci is not high. detailed chromosome information is provided by analysis of the rh map and whole genome sequences. we are interested in whether yellowtail appeared earlier in evolution than medaka, and when yellowtail diverged from medaka after the major rearrangements of the chromosomes. currently, we are studying snps at the genome level and performing dna chip analyses using snps in ests.

CONCLUSIONS
in the transcriptome analysis,  <dig>  snps were identified in  <dig>  contigs. a linkage map for yellowtail was then constructed, which comprised  <dig> linkage groups including  <dig> snp markers, and an rh map was constructed with  <dig>  markers. our synteny results indicated conserved synteny between yellowtail and medaka, and that the syntenic relationship between yellowtail and zebrafish would be rather low: these results reflect the known taxonomic relationships of these fish. the high-density maps will help the assembly of the genome sequence in the comparative analysis of synteny and will aid the search for candidate genes using quantitative trait locus  analysis.
