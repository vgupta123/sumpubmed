BACKGROUND
in their natural environment plants are constantly attacked by a variety of pathogens. nevertheless, plants can detect and evade most infection attempts through constitutive and inducible immune responses. the inducible responses consist of two layers  <cit> . the first layer is triggered by multifarious pathogen-associated molecular patterns . the perception of pamps by plant pattern recognition receptors  stimulates a number of cellular events, which include production of reactive oxygen species, activation of mitogen-activated kinases, enhanced expression of defense genes and production of antimicrobial compounds  <cit> . the second layer of inducible responses is activated by variable pathogen-specific effectors. recognition of effectors by the plant is mostly mediated by a class of resistance proteins which contain nucleotide binding site and leucine rich repeat  domains. the regulation and execution of both inducible responses involve hormone signalling pathways  <cit> .

emerging evidence illustrates that defense pathways are not only regulated by classical hormones, but also amino acid metabolic pathways constitute an important part of the plant immune system  <cit> . besides the fact that some amino acids serve as precursors of antimicrobial compounds   <cit> , amino acid homeostasis is pivotal for the outcome of plant-microbe interactions. a dominant nematode resistance gene in soybean encodes a serine hydroxymethyltransferase , which plays a key role in one-carbon folate metabolism  <cit> . the shmt allele in the resistant genotype encodes an isoform of the enzyme with altered kinetic properties compared with the isoform in susceptible genotypes. this altered shmt enzyme is likely associated with perturbation of the folate pathway resulting in nutritional deficiency for nematodes. overexpression of a pepper asparagine synthetase in arabidopsis enhanced the resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens, which was correlated with increased asparagine levels  <cit> . arabidopsis recessive downy mildew-resistant  mutants defective in homoserine kinase were found to be resistant to the oomycete hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis . the resistance was homoserine-induced, and independent of known signalling pathways  <cit> . suppression of the ortholog sldmr <dig> in tomato resulted in elevated resistance to powdery mildew oidium neolycopersici <cit> . resistance to hpa was also obtained in arabidopsis rar1-suppressor  mutants, in which the level of threonine  was highly elevated  <cit> . the rsp <dig> mutant carries a mutation in the aspartate kinase <dig> gene  <cit> , which catalyzes the first step in the aspartate-derived amino acid pathway. the rsp <dig> mutant contains a loss-of-function allele of dihydrodipicolinate synthase <dig> <cit> , which is the key enzyme in lysine biosynthesis. disruption of an amino acid transporter lht <dig> confers a broad spectrum disease resistance in arabidopsis plants, likely as a result of deficiency of glutamine  <cit> .

oidium neolycopersici  is an important biotrophic fungal disease for greenhouse crops. unlike most powdery mildews that are host specific, on can infect a wide range of hosts, including species of the solanaceae and cucurbitaceae families  <cit> . a favourable strategy to control the disease consists of exploration of resistant alleles from wild species and introgression of these alleles into cultivated species to develop resistant cultivars. in tomato nine loci conferring resistance to on have been identified  <cit> . one of them - ol- <dig> - originates from solanum habrochaites g <dig>   <cit> , and confers incomplete resistance associated with slow hypersensitive response   <cit> . it is located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  and has been fine-mapped to a region encompassing six predicted genes, based on the sequence of tomato cultivar heinz  <dig>  <cit>  & unpublished results. none of the six genes encodes a protein with nb-lrr domains. unravelling the identity of ol- <dig> has not been successful yet, because silencing of the predicted candidate genes individually did not attenuate the resistance level of the near-isogenic line carrying ol- <dig>  . another resistance gene - ol- <dig> â€“ which has been introgressed from s. peruvianum la <dig> confers complete resistance to on with fast hr  <cit> . it has been mapped to the mi- <dig> gene cluster on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . disease tests showed that nil-ol- <dig> was resistant to root-knot nematodes, indicating the presence of a functional mi- <dig> homolog encoding a nb-lrr type protein. furthermore, silencing of mi- <dig> homologs in nil-ol- <dig> compromised the resistance to both on and root-knot nematodes, showing that ol- <dig> is a mi- <dig> homolog  <cit> .

in a previous study designed to elucidate the pathways of on resistance, a cdna-aflp approach was used to identify transcript-derived fragments  showing differential presence or intensity in resistant tomato nils relative to susceptible moneymaker  after mock-inoculation or inoculation with powdery mildew on <cit> . a blast analysis of the sequences of a number of differentially expressed tdfs was performed using the sol genomics network  database to identify unigene sequences showing highest homology to each tdf. subsequently, tobacco rattle virus -based virus-induced gene silencing  constructs were generated targeting the unigenes. then, vigs was performed in the genotypes in which the tdf was detected to analyse whether silencing of targeted genes altered on resistance. in this way, it was shown that a putative glutathione s-transferase gene is required for ol-1-mediated resistance against on <cit> .

in the present study we focused on another of these differentially expressed tdf  and analysed its involvement in on resistance. m11e69- <dig> was specifically present in nil-ol- <dig> but absent in mm and nil-ol- <dig> <cit> . the sequence of this tdf showed homology to acetolactate synthase . als  is more frequently referred to as acetohydroxyacid synthase   <cit>  in other studies. in this study, we describe it as als based on the annotation in the sgn database. als catalyzes the first step in the production of the branched-chain amino acids  valine, leucine and isoleucine  <cit> . it is extensively studied since it is a target of commercially successful herbicides. different herbicide molecules can block substrate access to the active site of the als enzyme  <cit> . here, we report the involvement of als in ol-1-mediated resistance to powdery mildew in tomato.

RESULTS
down-regulation of two als genes simultaneously compromises ol-1-mediated resistance to powdery mildew on
in the cdna-aflp study by li et al.  <cit>  tdf fragment m11e69- <dig>  was observed to be present in on-resistant nil-ol- <dig>  but absent in on-susceptible mm and on-resistant nil-ol- <dig>  blast analysis of the sequence of this 195-bp tdf fragment was initially performed using the sgn database before the tomato genome sequence became publicly available. highest homology was obtained for unigene sgn-u <dig>  a capsicum annuum als gene . primers were designed based on the u <dig> sequence, and a 287-bp pcr product obtained using nil-ol- <dig> cdna as template was cloned into vigs vector trv <dig>  resulting in vector trv-u <dig> . infiltration of trv-u <dig> into nil-ol- <dig> induced morphological changes, including short stature and curled leaves with chlorotic areas . subsequently, vigs plants were inoculated with on. quantification of fungal biomass showed that there was a significant  increase on plants infiltrated with trv-u <dig> compared to plants infiltrated with the empty vector  .

after the tomato genome sequence became accessible a new blast analysis of the sequence present in the vigs vector was performed. this resulted in the identification of three putative als genes in tomato named als <dig> , als <dig>  and als <dig>  . the latter one, although present on chromosome  <dig>  does not reside in the ol- <dig> region  <cit> . als <dig> and als <dig> predicted proteins are 94% identical at the amino acid level, while als <dig> is quite different from als <dig> and als <dig>  . the als <dig> and als <dig> genes are predicted to contain one exon, whereas als <dig> is predicted to contain three exons . alignment of the tdf sequence  with the three annotated als genes showed that the tdf was probably derived from the als <dig> ortholog in s. habrochaites . however, alignment of the cloned fragment in the vigs construct with the three annotated als genes resulted in highest homology to als <dig>  this discrepancy can be explained, because for construction of the vigs vector primers were designed based on the sgn unigene showing highest homology to the tdf, but no unigene based on est sequences from als <dig> was present in the sgn database. the alignment suggested that the vigs vector targeted both als <dig> and als <dig>  but not als <dig>  based on the assumption that an identical sequence of at least  <dig> nucleotides is necessary for efficient silencing. to validate the specificity of silencing, transcript levels of als <dig>  als <dig> and als <dig> in nil-ol- <dig> plants subjected to vigs were measured by qrt-pcr using rna isolated after pooling the third and fourth whole leaves of each plant. in this experimental set-up expression levels of the three als genes were not significantly reduced in trv-u196237-infiltrated plants compared with trv-ev-infiltrated plants , although the alteration in leaf morphology indicated a vigs effect. however, we noticed that fungal colony growth was stronger on the chlorotic areas of the leaves than on the green areas. therefore, transcript levels of als <dig>  als <dig> and als <dig> were compared between leaf samples collected from excised green and chlorotic areas of trv-u196237-infiltrated plants. the expression levels of als <dig> and als <dig> were significantly lower in chlorotic areas in comparison with green areas, while expression of als <dig> was also somewhat decreased in chlorotic areas, but not significantly . this indicated that the fragment present in the trv-u <dig> vigs construct specifically silenced als <dig> and als <dig>  but not als <dig> 

to confirm the results obtained with vigs, we generated stable transformants of nil-ol- <dig> in which both als <dig> and als <dig> were silenced by an rnai construct  containing an inverted repeat of the same sequence as present in the trv-u <dig> vector. we expected that when als <dig> and als <dig> were efficiently silenced by rnai the transformants would show the same visible phenotype as in vigs, i.e. smaller plants with chlorotic leaves. nine primary transformants  were selfed to produce t <dig> families. for each t <dig> family ten plants were phenotypically examined. one t <dig> family  showed clear segregation for the phenotypic traits mentioned above  . the altered phenotype co-segregated with the presence of the silencing construct, as indicated by amplification of the 35s promoter . after inoculation with on the t <dig> plants with an altered phenotype showed increased sporulation when compared with the untransformed nil-ol- <dig> plants , although full susceptibility as in cultivar mm was not reached. fungal growth and transcript levels of als genes were quantified in nil-ol- <dig> plants and in t <dig> plants with altered phenotype. the results showed that the on fungal biomass in these t <dig> plants was significantly increased compared with nil-ol- <dig> . as expected, the gene expression levels of both als <dig> and als <dig> were significantly suppressed in the rnai-als1â€‰+â€‰2Â t <dig> plants, whereas als <dig> expression was not significantly reduced .

in addition to the production of stable transformants in which both als <dig> and als <dig> were silenced simultaneously, stable nil-ol- <dig> transformants were produced in which the three als genes were silenced individually to evaluate their involvement in ol- <dig> resistance. no cross-silencing was observed . transformed t <dig> plants were selfed to obtain t <dig> families. one t <dig> family for als <dig>  three for als <dig>  and two for als <dig> were obtained. the nptii-containing, and thus transgenic, t <dig> plants were selected by pcr analysis. the transgenic t <dig> progeny showed a significant reduction of expression of the targeted als gene . silencing of the three als genes individually did not lead to morphological alteration, and fungal abundance was not enhanced compared to that in untransformed nil-ol- <dig> plants . the fact that suppression of individual als genes did not compromise ol-1-mediated resistance, but suppression of at least two als genes compromised the resistance indicated that the function of als genes is likely overlapping.

we did not try to generate a construct targeting all three genes simultaneously, because no continuous stretch of at least  <dig> identical nucleotides is present when aligning the complete coding sequences of the three als genes .

als is specifically involved in ol-1-mediated resistance
acetolactate synthase is a well-known target for commercial herbicides, which block binding of substrates to the active site of the als enzyme  <cit> . we employed this system to determine whether als was generally involved in powdery mildew resistance or specifically involved in ol-1-mediated resistance. the herbicide chlorsulfuron was used as the als inhibitor. first, we studied the effect of herbicide treatment in nil-ol- <dig> plants. as chlorsulfuron was dissolved in acetone, we included plants to which only acetone was applied as well as plants to which water was applied as controls. the herbicide application caused inhibition of shoot growth and overall chlorosis of the plant . quantification of fungal dna showed that a significant increase of fungal biomass was attributable to herbicide treatment, as compared with the acetone control .

as powdery mildew fungi depend on living tissue for nutrient uptake, we wondered whether the probable perturbation of amino acid homeostasis due to silencing of als could be exploited by the pathogen, and in turn influence the basal defense. to address this question we treated susceptible tomato mm with chlorsulfuron. if als is important for basal defence against powdery mildew, one would anticipate an increase of sporulation. after herbicide treatment we observed morphological changes in mm plants, which were similar to those in nil-ol- <dig> plants. however, fungal biomass in chlorsulfuron-treated mm plants was similar to fungal biomass in water- and acetone-treated mm, suggesting that als was not involved in basal defence . chlorsulfuron was also applied to nil-ol- <dig> plants to determine whether als is generally involved in powdery mildew resistance signalling pathways. quantification of fungal biomass showed that herbicide-treated nil-ol- <dig> plants retained a similar resistance level to powdery mildew as the control nil-ol- <dig> plants, suggesting that als is dispensable for resistance conferred by ol- <dig>  encoding a nb-lrr type protein .

similar to the results obtained with the vigs and rnai plants, we observed that, although nil-ol- <dig> plants in which als function was impaired showed increased susceptibility to on, full susceptibility as in cultivar mm was not reached. this is shown in figureÂ 4c, in which fungal biomass in nil-ol- <dig> and nil-ol- <dig> plants is calibrated to the level in water-treated mm.

expression of als genes upon powdery mildew attack in nil-ol- <dig> and mm
to investigate the response of three als genes under powdery mildew attack, their transcript levels were measured in nil-ol- <dig> and mm. expression of als <dig> and als <dig> was detected in both genotypes, and they were not induced by powdery mildew inoculation in either genotype . anova analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in expression levels of als <dig> and als <dig> between nil-ol- <dig> and mm. als <dig> expression was only detected in nil-ol- <dig>  while in mm it may be either weakly expressed below detection level, or not expressed at all . we could exclude the possibility that primers for quantifying als <dig> expression were not suitable for mm because a pcr product of the expected size was obtained using genomic dna as template. further, rna-seq data of als <dig>  from tomato cultivar heinz  <cit>  confirm that als <dig> is not expressed in tomato leaves .

discussion
in a screen of differentially expressed transcripts showing a difference in presence or intensity when comparing powdery mildew-resistant nils with susceptible mm, tdf m11e69- <dig> was identified  <cit> , which shows homology to acetolactate synthase. this tdf was specifically present in nil-ol- <dig>  but absent in both mm and nil-ol- <dig> <cit> . by targeting acetolactate synthases via vigs, rnai and herbicide application, we demonstrated that als activity was specifically important for ol-1-based resistance . als does not seem to be involved in basal defense as indicated by unchanged susceptibility after herbicide treatment of mm, nor required for resistance controlled by nb-lrr-type resistance genes as indicated by the results from herbicide treatment of nil-ol- <dig> .

possible involvement of als <dig> in ol-1-mediated resistance to on
the fact that tdf m11e69- <dig> was observed in nil-ol- <dig>  but absent in both mm and nil-ol- <dig> could be caused solely by the presence of nucleotide polymorphisms between mm and nil-ol- <dig>  however, we have shown that the corresponding als <dig> gene is truly differentially expressed, as als <dig> transcripts were observed in leaves from nil-ol- <dig> but not in mm leaves . the sequence of m11e69- <dig> from nil-ol- <dig> showed higher similarity to als <dig> than to als <dig> and als <dig> from s. lycopersicum . als <dig>  is located on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  but not in the ol- <dig> region. als <dig> and als <dig> are located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. as nil-ol- <dig> only contains  chromosome  <dig> of s. habrochaites g <dig>  whereas all other chromosomes are from s. lycopersicum mm, we expected that the als <dig> and als <dig> genes from nil-ol- <dig> were identical to those from mm. this was indeed observed after sequencing complete als <dig> and als <dig> cdnas from nil-ol- <dig> . in contrast, sequencing of the complete als <dig> cdna from nil-ol- <dig> revealed a number of snps and indels in nil-ol- <dig> compared to the predicted sequence from tomato cultivar heinz in the sgn database . nil-ol- <dig>  containing an introgression of part of chromosome  <dig> from s. peruvianum accession la <dig>  <cit> , was shown to contain als <dig> and als <dig> sequences identical to those from mm, whereas the als <dig> sequence from nil-ol- <dig> differed from both mm and nil-ol- <dig> 

the vigs and rnai constructs targeted als <dig> and als <dig>  but not als <dig> . as als <dig> and als <dig> in all three genotypes are identical, but the effect of silencing is specific for nil-ol- <dig>  we wonder whether als <dig> plays a role in resistance to tomato powdery mildew conferred by ol- <dig>  although als <dig> is homologous to acetolactate synthase genes whose function has been proven, the exact function of the als <dig> protein is unknown. in plants als is a heteromultimer, consisting of catalytic and regulatory subunits  <cit> . all three tomato proteins als <dig>  als <dig> and als <dig> are homologous to known catalytic subunits, such as the sura and surb proteins of nicotiana tabacum <cit> . in solanaceous species from which genome sequences are available three als genes coding for catalytic subunits are present. in contrast, arabidopsis only contains one als gene encoding the catalytic subunit, i.e. at3g <dig> 

in mm and nil-ol- <dig> only als <dig> and als <dig> are expressed in leaves, while als <dig> is not. similarly, the orthologs of als <dig> in s. pimpinellifolium and s. tuberosum are not expressed in leaves . nil-ol- <dig> is exceptional, as in this genotype als <dig> is expressed in leaves, together with als <dig> and als <dig>  and therefore als <dig> may be incorporated in the als holoenzyme. possibly, the presence of different catalytic subunits in the als holoenzyme confers different functionalities or substrate specificities. although silencing of only als <dig> in the nil-ol- <dig> background did not result in increased susceptibility to on , this does not exclude the possibility that als <dig> is involved in resistance. the obtained transformants showed significant silencing of als <dig> , but no complete silencing comparable with a knock-out mutation was achieved. additional experiments are needed to elucidate the function of als <dig> in leaves of nil-ol- <dig>  for example expression of the s. habrochaites als <dig> gene in mm background.

involvement of amino acid homeostasis caused by altered als activity in ol-1-mediated resistance
although acetolactate synthase is a known target of several herbicides, it is unclear how herbicide-binding affects the amino acid metabolism in plants. scheel and casida  <cit>  found that chlorsulfuron treatment of soybean suspension cultures caused a decrease of the valine and leucine contents, but had no effect on other amino acids. they showed that growth inhibition by chlorsulfuron was alleviated by supplying exogenous valine or leucine, or a combination of valine, leucine and isoleucine. consistent with a reduction of bcaas caused by an als-affecting herbicide, ray  <cit>  observed that addition of valine and isoleucine to excised pea root cultures reversed herbicide-induced growth inhibition. growth retardation can also result from als feedback inhibition by individual end products. chen et al.  <cit>  showed that addition of valine or leucine to the growth medium inhibited root growth of arabidopsis seedlings, whereas addition of isoleucine had no effect. when a combination of valineâ€‰+â€‰isoleucine, or leucineâ€‰+â€‰isoleucine was added to the medium root growth inhibition was less pronounced, suggesting isoleucine counteracted the inhibitory effect of valine and leucine  <cit> . royuela et al.  <cit>  detected an increase in the relative proportion of some amino acids other than bcaas in chlorsulfuron-treated wheat and maize. hÃ¶fgen et al.  <cit>  silenced als in potato by antisense inhibition, resulting in a decrease of als activity of up to 85%. strong silencing of als resulted in severe growth retardation and stunting, and leaf chlorosis. similar phenotypic alterations were obtained by treatment with an imidazolinone herbicide. measurement of amino acids showed an accumulation of total free amino acids as well as perturbed composition in antisense and herbicide-treated plants. unexpectedly, instead of decreased levels, elevated amounts of amino acids including valine, leucine and isoleucine were observed, especially in older sink leaves.

recently, another example of a link between herbicide resistance, increased amino acid levels, and resistance to fungal species was reported. patent us <dig>  <cit>  discloses that corn plants expressing the bacterial gdha gene  are resistant to aflatoxin accumulation following aspergillus infection. furthermore, corn and tobacco plants transformed with the gdha gene are resistant to root rot following fusarium virguliforme infection. previously, it has been shown that tobacco plants transformed with the gdha gene show an increased level of resistance to the herbicide glufosinate  <cit>  and that total free amino acids were increased in these plants  <cit> .

taken together, the effect of als inhibition on levels of individual amino acids is difficult to predict, as it seems to depend on the level of residual als activity in different tissues, and the feedback-inhibition effect of  of individual amino acids. despite this, we investigated whether bcaas contents influence powdery mildew susceptibility or resistance in tomato cultivar mm and nil-ol- <dig> by exogenously applying leucine, isoleucine and valine  <cit>  & additional file  <dig>  homoserine and threonine were also included in the experiment, because they were found to affect plant immunity, and threonine is the precursor of isoleucine. if a higher level of bcaas contributes to ol-1-mediated resistance, we expected to gain powdery mildew resistance to some degree in mm with elevated bcaas levels. quantification of fungal dna showed that only exogenous application of homoserine significantly reduced the susceptibility of mm and increased resistance of nil-ol- <dig> to on, whereas application of the other amino acids did not alter the responses of mm and nil-ol- <dig> to on <cit>  & additional file  <dig>  we also did not observe the growth retardation which can be caused by individual end products, possibly because the concentration was not sufficiently high to cause this. the results suggested that instead of an elevated level, a reduced level of bcaas or changed compositions of individual amino acids may play a role in ol-1-mediated powdery mildew resistance. amino acid deprivation is known to activate defences in arabidopsis. for instance, the accumulation of camalexin, a pathogen-inducible antimicrobial phytoalexin was induced by bcaas starvation  <cit> . an alternative hypothesis is the involvement of an amino acid-derived signal in defense signalling pathways, as suggested for arabidopsis genes ald <dig> and agd <dig> encoding aminotransferases  <cit> . furthermore, studies on plant hormone conjugates showed that jasmonate  can conjugate bcaas  <cit>  and, in particular, ja-isoleucine is the main bioactive form of the hormone  <cit> . in addition, altered expression of an enzyme involved in conjugation affects salicylic acid-mediated disease resistance  <cit> .

in the case of ol- <dig>  perturbation of amino acid balance by silencing of als or herbicide treatment may impair the integrity of the signalling network, leading to the loss of resistance conferred by ol- <dig>  the unknown identity of ol- <dig> makes it harder to understand the link between ol-1-mediated resistance and amino acid homeostasis. cloning of ol- <dig>  determination of amino acid homeostasis, and dissection of changes in hormone signalling pathways will aid in understanding the requirement of als activity for ol-1-based resistance and shed light on the interaction of amino acid metabolism and plant immunity.

CONCLUSIONS
tomato genome encodes three als genes. silencing of each of them did not attenuate ol-1-mediated resistance to tomato powdery mildew, while down-regulation of both als <dig> and als <dig> simultaneously or inhibition of the als activity resulted in the loss of ol-1-mediated resistance to tomato powdery mildew. further research on cloning of ol- <dig> and association of amino-acid homeostasis with als activity may provide insight into the role of amino acid metabolism in tomato resistance to powdery mildew.
