BACKGROUND
avian influenza  is an infectious disease caused by avian influenza virus , a member of the orthomyxoviridae family  <cit> . aiv is an enveloped, negative-stranded, segmented rna virus. the aiv genome consists of eight rna segments that vary in size ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bases and code for  <dig> known proteins. aiv produces  <dig> viral proteins that can be divided into three main categories: surface proteins, internal proteins, and nonstructural proteins  <cit> . the viral particle contains three surface proteins: hemagglutinin , neuraminidase , and matrix  <dig>  proteins. the internal proteins of the viral particle include three polymerase proteins, pa, pb <dig>  and pb <dig>  as well as nucleoprotein, matrix  <dig> , and nonstructural protein  <dig> . nonstructural protein  <dig>  is a protein that is not packaged into the virus particle, although it is produced in large quantities in infected cells  <cit> . ns <dig> protein plays an important role in virus infection and in the viral replication process. it has been shown to counteract the host type i interferon response  <cit> , to mediate host cell apoptosis  <cit> , and to regulate the process of protein synthesis  <cit> .

aiv can be classified into high  and low  pathogenic avian influenza viruses depending on the severity of the diseases that they cause, ranging from asymptomatic infections to acute systemic diseases and even death  <cit> . during the last decades, hpaiv has been involved in several outbreaks in poultry and wild birds around the world  <cit> . the epidemic of ai represented by the h5n <dig> subtype continues to cause severe losses for the poultry industry and threatens both human health and public health worldwide. vaccination against aiv, despite being a powerful tool for disease control, makes distinguishing between infected and vaccinated animals through serological tests difficult  <cit> . to overcome this problem, several studies have focused on a differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals program of ai, which is mostly centralized on the ns <dig> protein-based antibody response  <cit> . our study aimed to contribute to this program by generating a monoclonal antibody  to ns <dig> and identifying the epitope recognized by this mab.

RESULTS
expression and characterization of a recombinant aiv ns <dig> protein
the recombinant ns <dig> protein was expressed predominantly as an inclusion body in e. coli after iptg induction. it was purified by affinity chromatography and analyzed by sds-page . western blot analysis indicated that the purified recombinant ns <dig> protein, which was encoded by the gene from the h5n <dig> virus, was reactive with aiv-positive sera . these results show that the purified recombinant ns <dig> protein was a suitable antigen for immunization and hybridoma screening.fig.  <dig> sds-page analysis of the recombinant ns <dig> protein and purified ns <dig> protein. m, marker. lane  <dig>  proteins expressed in e. coli without iptg induction. lane  <dig>  proteins expressed in e. coli with iptg induction. lane  <dig>  purified recombinant ns <dig> protein

production and characterization of ns1-specific mab
purified recombinant ns <dig> protein expressed in e. coli was used to immunize balb/c mice. after cell fusion and screening, several hybridoma cell lines were obtained, which produced ns1-specific mabs. one mab produced by the line, designated as d <dig>  was selected for its strong reactivity with recombinant ns <dig> protein in indirect elisa  and western blot  assays. furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy results show that mab d <dig> had a strong reactivity with ns <dig> expressed in 293t cells transfected with eukaryotic recombinant plasmids . mab d <dig> was composed of an igg <dig> heavy chain paired with a κ-type light chain, as determined using the sba clonotyping™ system/hrp kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the titers of mab d <dig> in hybridoma cell culture supernatants and in ascites were measured by indirect elisa and determined to be 1: <dig>  and 1: <dig> , respectively.fig.  <dig> the binding of mab d <dig> with prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression of ns <dig> protein. the binding of mab d <dig> with prokaryotic purified recombinant ns <dig> protein  and ns <dig> protein expressed in 293t cells transfected with eukaryotic recombinant plasmids .  <dig>  the binding of mab d <dig> with ns <dig> protein expressed in 293t cells.  <dig>  the binding of negative serum with ns <dig> protein expressed in 293t cells



phage enrichment
to define the mab binding epitope, a phage-displayed 7-mer random peptide library was screened with mab d <dig>  the output to input ratios of the three rounds of biopanning were  <dig>  × 10− <dig>   <dig>  × 10− <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  respectively, which indicated an enrichment of phages bound to mab d <dig>  after three successive rounds of biopanning, the selected  <dig> phage clones showed higher reactivity by phage elisa with mab d <dig> than with a negative control of irrelevant mab .fig.  <dig> detection of the selected phages for mab d <dig> binding by phage elisa. after three successive rounds of biopanning, phage elisa was performed for further identification of the positive phage clones that were successfully sequenced. an irrelevant mab was used as a negative control. error bars represent the standard deviation of the results from three replicate experiments

epitope identification
to confirm the linear epitope recognized by mab d <dig>  the motif wndntvrvs was expressed as glutathione s-transferase  fusion protein gst-wt. western blot analysis results show that mab d <dig> reacted with gst-wt . to further identify the minimal epitope, six truncated motifs, gst-wtΔs, gst-wtΔvs, gst-wtΔrvs, gst-wtΔvrvs, gst-wtΔtvrvs, and gst-wtΔw, were expressed in e. coli and then subjected to western blot with mab d <dig>  the results show that except for gst-wtΔtvrvs and gst-wtΔw, the other motifs were recognized by the mab d <dig>  suggesting that the motif wndnt represents a minimal unit for the reactivity of the epitope recognized by mab d <dig> . taken together, these results show that wndnt is a minimal linear b-cell epitope of aiv ns <dig> protein.fig.  <dig> reactivity of the gst-fusion proteins with the mab d <dig>  western blots were performed to test the reactivity of mab d <dig> with the gst-fusion proteins containing wild-type and truncated  or mutant  motifs derived from the motif wndntvrvs. marker: pageruler™ prestained protein ladder. gst-7wt: fusion protein containing the motif wndntvrvs, gst-wtΔs: wndntvrv, gst-wtΔvs: wndntvr, gst-wtΔrvs: wndntv, gst-wtΔvrvs: wndnt, gst-wtΔtvrvs: wndn, gst-wtΔw-vrvs: ndnt, gst-t186s: wndns, gst-n183s: wsdnt, gst-d184g: wngnt and gst-d184n: wnnnt

fig.  <dig> elisa analysis for reactivity of the identified epitope with aiv-positive chicken sera. expressed protein  was used to coat the 96-well plates. aiv-positive chicken sera was used to detect the coated proteins, aiv-negative chicken sera was included as a negative control. error bars represent the standard error of the mean of the results from three replicate experiments



reactivity of the identified epitope with aiv-positive chicken sera
to verify whether the identified epitope could be recognized by aiv-positive chicken sera, an indirect elisa assay was performed. 96-well plates were coated with the protein gst-wtΔvrvs. the elisa results indicated that the identified epitope peptide wndnt could be recognized by the aiv-positive chicken sera but not by aiv-negative chicken sera, revealing that the epitope exhibited good reactivity and would be useful for the diagnosis of aiv .

homology analysis
all sequences in the ncbi influenza virus sequence database were aligned using clustal software to evaluate the degree of conservation of the linear epitope recognized by mab d <dig> among aiv. the resulting alignment indicated that the epitope 182wndnt <dig> is highly conserved among different isolates, although in some sequences a single amino acid substitution was identified . based on these amino acid substitutions, we expressed four mutant motifs, gst-t186s, gst-n183s, gst-d184g, and gst-d184n, as gst fusion proteins. western blot assays indicated that mab d <dig> could recognize all of the fusion proteins . the amino acid substitutions at different sites within the epitope among some isolates did not affect the reactivity of mab d <dig> with the epitope, which suggested that mab d <dig> was broadly recognized by almost all aiv ns <dig> 

discussion
as with other viruses, the antigenic structures of aiv are recognized by the immune system through binding of its epitopes by the surface receptors on specific clones of t cells or b cells, inducing a humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response  <cit> . to our knowledge, previous studies of epitopes against aiv have mainly focused on the ha protein rather than on the ns <dig> protein . thus, the identification of an aiv epitope on ns <dig> protein is important for understanding influenza virus pathogenesis. this finding will facilitate further study on the molecular mechanisms responsible for viral stimulation of the immune response.

mab combined with phage display is one of the most widely used and fastest-growing tools for mapping epitopes  <cit> . it has been successfully applied to identify a variety of pathogenic microorganism epitopes. compared with other existing methods, phage display is a simple, fast, and convenient method for mapping epitopes  <cit> . moreover, the phage display peptide library can be screened to affinity-select mimotopes, which are peptides that mimic discontinuous epitopes  <cit> . screening of a 12-mer peptide library was performed for the identification of a conserved linear b-cell epitope of the e <dig> glycoprotein n-terminus of classical swine fever virus  <cit> . sun et al. similarly screened a 12-mer peptide library using phage-display technology to define the linear epitope recognized by west nile virus c protein-specific mab  <cit> . here, we used purified recombinant ns <dig> expressed in e. coli to generate mab d <dig>  then, by screening a phage display random 7-mer peptide library with mab d <dig>  the motif wndntvrvs located from aa <dig> to aa <dig> of the aiv ns <dig> protein was defined as the linear epitope of mab d <dig>  furthermore, by using a set of truncated polypeptides expressed as gst fusion proteins, we identified wndnt as a minimal linear b-cell epitope of aiv ns <dig> protein.

to investigate the conservation of the identified linear epitope among aiv viruses, all sequences in the ncbi influenza virus sequence database were aligned using clustal software. there are  <dig>  ns <dig> protein sequences  in total in the database.  <dig>  % of the sequences contain the epitope wndnt.  <dig>  % of the sequences have a unique amino acid substitution, with  <dig>  sequences that replace d with g,  <dig>  sequences that replace t with s,  <dig> sequences that replace d with n, and  <dig> sequences that replace the first n with s. amino acid substitution or lack of it was not related to the hosts and subtypes of the viruses. these results show that the epitope is present widely in influenza virus strains . among the mutated amino acids, d, g, and n are polar amino acids and n, s, and t are uncharged polar amino acids.table  <dig> sequence comparison of the identified epitope among aiv strains available in the ncbi influenza virus sequence database



many epitopes have been defined in the ns <dig> protein of aiv viruses, and most of them have been mapped by mabs produced in mice immunized with recombinant proteins or synthesized peptides. among the previously-mapped epitopes, there are seven epitopes that do not overlap with the epitope identified in this study. these epitopes are lewndntvrvtetiqrfawrnsdedgrlplppnqkr  <cit> , ewndntvrvsetlqrfa  <cit> , vligglewndntvrvse , ewndntvrvsetlqr and ligglewndntvrvs  <cit> , glewndntv  <cit> , and ewndntvrv  <cit> . there are also three epitopes that contain part of the epitope identified in this study. they are vknaigvligglewndn  <cit> , dedvknaigvligglewndn  <cit> , and navgvligglewndn  <cit> . because none of these epitopes are completely identical to the epitope described in this study, this new epitope is another different linear epitope on the aiv ns <dig> protein. the mab and its epitope described in this study will facilitate further study on the function of ns <dig> and aid in diagnostic method development for aiv detection.

CONCLUSIONS
this study identified the motif wndnt as a conserved linear epitope on the aiv ns <dig> protein that is recognized by the mab d <dig>  this mab and its epitope may facilitate further study on the pathogenesis of aiv and aid in diagnostic method development for aiv detection.
