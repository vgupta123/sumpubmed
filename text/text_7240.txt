BACKGROUND
earth has experienced several episodes of severe climatic variation that have led to a succession of ice ages during the quaternary   <cit> . during this period, many species have experienced a succession of range expansions and contractions that have affected their genetic structure and diversity . in their review, excoffier et al.  <cit>  reported that the effects of these range expansions on genetic diversity could differ markedly from pure demographic expansions. range expansions are characterized by a decrease in genetic diversity along the expansion axis, owing to recurrent bottlenecks and founder events  <cit> .

in north america, the last ice age is unquestionably the most recent event to have had severe consequences for boreal species genetic diversity  <cit> . according to estimates by dyke et al.  <cit> , the last glacial maximum  occurred 18– <dig> ky bp. it is therefore considered to be that point when the last massive expansion of plants from different glacial refugia was initiated. williams  <cit>  and roberts and hamann  <cit>  have reconstructed the evolution of land covered by several tree species in north america since the lgm, thereby allowing the identification of potential refugia for those species. also, molecular studies have shown evidence of genetic structure for several north american plant species .

beatty and provan  <cit>  proposed a set of  <dig> potential glacial refugia for terrestrial plant and animals in north america. this set was subsequently reduced by callahan  <cit>  to  <dig> potential refugia for trembling aspen , including: beringia, the grand banks, the northeastern united states, the “driftless area” of the mid-western united states, the “ice-free corridor” along the and eastern slopes of the alberta rocky mountains, e.g.,  and the clearwater refugium of northern idaho, e.g.,  <cit> .

beringia has been suspected of being a refugium for mammals  <cit> , herbaceous plants  <cit> , and trees  during the last ice age maximum. simulated suitable habitat during the lgm for some boreal and sub-boreal species such as white spruce , black spruce , lodgepole pine , and p. tremuloides were usually located along the northern pacific coast and in beringia, as well as their presence south of the ice sheet  <cit> . paleoecological and palynological studies have revealed the presence of populus in alaska shortly after the beginning of the ice cap melting, suggesting that the genus has persisted in this area . for balsam poplar , recent molecular evidence does not support alaska as glacial refugium but does confirm the existence of two distinct groups in northwestern north america, i.e., a northern group in alaska and yukon, and a central group in central distribution area  <cit> . keller et al.  <cit>  concluded that the central group descended from the main demographic refugium of p. balsamifera under pleistocene range restrictions, with an expansion toward its margins during range expansion following lgm. for p. tremuloides, two models that were based on paleoecological data suggest the existence of refugial habitats in beringia and was likely a true refugium for this species. moreover, callahan et al.  <cit>  have shown the existence of two distinct groups for trembling aspen, namely, one in southwestern usa, and the other in canada and alaska. within the second group, the higher allelic richness that was detected in aspen populations located in alaska and in alberta suggests that beringia was likely to be a true refugium and that the presence of an “ice-free corridor” in alberta could have permitted to p. tremuloides to persist in this area during the lgm  <cit> .

the existence of an “ice-free corridor” between the laurentian and cordilleran ice sheets is debated  <cit> . since the ice sheets did not advance at the same time in this region, a temporally and geographically shifting ice-free zone could have existed  <cit> . the laurentian and cordilleran ice sheets only coalesced for a brief span of time  <cit> , while numerous isolated foothills of the rocky mountains also could have remained ice-free during the lgm  <cit> , potentially leaving suitable habitats for p. tremuloides. yet, suitable habitat conditions for p. tremuloides during the lgm were not found in this area according to the simulations of by roberts and hamann  <cit> . in contrast, callahan et al.  <cit>  reported a higher level of genetic diversity for p. tremuloides in this region. this area appears to be important either as a potentially cryptic refugium or more likely as an admixture zone.

the purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the origin of trembling aspen in western north america is reflected in the patterns of neutral genetic diversity and population structure. in the present study, the glacial origin and post-glacial migration route in the northwestern part of the range was uncovered by studying the area analyzed by callahan et al.  <cit>  at a finer scale. our aim was to test whether beringia and the “ice-free corridor” that was situated between the laurentian and cordilleran ice sheets might have been the two glacial refugia for trembling aspen in northwestern north america during the wisconsin ice age. the hypothesis were as follows: 1) aspen populations that were located near refugia  should be highly divergent; 2) within-population diversity should decrease with distance from refugia, due to multiple founder events; 3) the “ice-free corridor” was an admixture zone, where divergent lineages  had converged.

methods
study area and sampling
samples were collected from  <dig> geo-referenced sampling sites covering the northwestern part of trembling aspen’s distribution from manitoba to alaska , which resulted in a total of  <dig> trembling aspen trees being sampled. a minimum of  <dig> trees was sampled from each of  <dig> sampling sites. we used leaf samples that were collected by a collaborating team from the university of saskatchewan  and utah state university/university of alaska fairbanks . the rest of the samples were collected from root cambia . within sampling sites, samples were collected to reduce the chance of resampling the same clone. the maximum distances between sampled trees could vary from hundreds of meters to few kilometers. leaves and root cambia were collected, dried in silica gel, and maintained at room temperature prior to dna extraction.fig.  <dig> study populations across the northwestern part of populus tremuloides distribution range




dna extraction, amplification and sequencing
dna was extracted using extract-n-amptm plant kit  using the manufacturer’s protocol. to evaluate genetic diversity and structure, microsatellite markers were selected because they are rapidly evolving, powerful and economical tools for describing patterns of gene flow and diversity. samples were amplified at  <dig> microsatellite loci: ptr <dig>  ptr <dig>  ptr <dig>  ptr <dig>  ptr <dig>  ptr <dig>  pmgc <dig>  wpms <dig>  wpms <dig>  wpms <dig>  wpms <dig>  and wpms <dig>  . each pcr was performed on a 10 μl total volume: 2 μl of a ten-fold diluted dna extract ; 5 μl qiagen® multiplex pcr kit ; and 1 μl h2o and 2 μl primer mix solution at 2 μm, for a final concentration of  <dig>  μm. pcr was carried out separately for each primer. reactions were performed in a mastercycler® pro thermal cyclers  with the following protocol: an initial denaturation step at 95 °c for 15 min, followed by 36 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s; a primer-specific annealing temperature for 90 s; 72 °c for 60 s; and a final extension at 60 °c for 30 min. annealing temperatures were 60 °c for ptr <dig>  ptr <dig>  ptr <dig>  ptr <dig>  wpms <dig>  wpms <dig> and wpms <dig> and 63 °c for ptr <dig>  pmgc <dig> and wpms <dig>  for ptr <dig> and vvpsm <dig>  a touchdown pcr was applied with an annealing temperature ranging from 65 °c to 60 °c during the first ten cycles. pcr products were analyzed on an automated capillary dna sequencer  using 2 μl of multiplexed pcr products, which were added to  <dig>  μl of hi-di™ formamide and  <dig>  μl of the genescan- <dig> liz size standard . allele sizes were scored using genemapper version  <dig>  .

data manipulation
the original set of  <dig> samples was then reduced: i) by removing loci with high presence of individuals with three alleles ; ii) by removing any sample with three alleles at one loci ; and iii) by removing duplicated genotypes  that were identical at all loci, to keep only one representative of each genotype. we used the software genodive  <cit>  to assign clone identities based on the stepwise mutation model . in a stepwise mutation model, alleles that differ only by a few repeats in length are thought to be of more recent common ancestry than alleles that differ by many repeats in length  <cit> . we considered that two individuals belonged to the same clone, if the total genetic distances  for all loci were lower than three mutations, to avoid identifying unique genotypes  that had resulted from scoring errors and soma-clonal mutations . following this operation, the subset contained successively  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> samples. from the  <dig> unique genotypes that were isolated from  <dig> microsatellite markers , populations with less than  <dig> unique trees were removed  to maintain sufficiently high statistical power for the following analyses. the final dataset consisted of unique diploid genotypes for  <dig> loci,  <dig> genets for  <dig> populations.

variation of genetic diversity
all descriptive genetic analyses were carried out with genalex v.  <dig>   <cit> . allele frequency, allele number, private alleles  and genetic estimates within populations, including the average number of alleles per locus , average number of effective alleles per locus , observed heterozygosity , and expected heterozygosity , were calculated using genalex v.  <dig>   <cit> . to describe genetic diversity within sampling areas across the range, allelic richness  across all ten loci were calculated using fstat v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with rarefaction, a method that was employed to account for differences in sample size. correlations between ar and he were computed, while hardy-weinberg  equilibrium was assessed by calculating the inbreeding coefficients  and their corresponding p-values for all sampling sites. we also ran a global test of hw equilibrium for all the samples pooled together. bonferroni correction was applied when testing the significance of heterozygosity deficit and heterozygosity excess. all of the hw equilibrium tests were performed in fstat  <cit> . finally, values of ar and ho were interpolated using the inverse distance weighting  method to create maps of each variable, using arcmap .

genetic structure analyses
mantel tests and correlograms, together with multivariate analysis of spatial patterns of genetic divergence  were performed with the package ade <dig>  <cit>  in the r statistical environment version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . a global simple mantel test was performed with the function mantel.rtest  <cit>  to test for significant correlations between genetic  and geographical distances  between sites, as well as isolation-by-distance patterns. assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity were checked before interpreting the results of the mantel test  <cit> . the definition of distance classes, both in terms of the total number of classes and their upper and lower limits, is somewhat arbitrary and depends upon the spatial distribution of the populations  <cit> . a “rule-of-thumb” suggests four to five classes for  <dig> populations. the mantel correlogram was constructed by plotting mantel correlations between the genetic distances for  <dig> classes of geographical distances with the function mantel.correlog in the vegan package  <cit> . particular care was taken to maintain a constant number of pairs of populations in each class creating unequal distance intervals. to complement the correlogram, we plotted the relationship between genetic and geographical distances, followed by plotting the genetic distance between two sites, which as estimated as fst /, as a function of geographical distance. we finally performed an analysis of molecular variance  in genodive  <cit> . pairwise fst were calculated for each population, together with its corresponding p-value, after which bonferroni corrections were applied .

the results of the mantel test and correlogram were confirmed by multivariate analysis, which was carried out using the functions dudi.pco and pcaiv to calculate the respective pcoa and rda ordinations  <cit> . pcoa was first applied to the fst matrix , with the retention of the first five axes for further analyses. to analyze patterns in the genetic data, we performed rda, using scores for the first five axes of the pcoa as the response variables, and longitudinal and latitudinal data as explanatory variables  <cit> . the output from the rda, which was obtained with the function summary, provided the percentage of the unconstrained variation  that was explained by the predictor . the function randtest was used to evaluate the rda significance by randomly permuting  the rows of the explanatory table  <cit> .

to reveal genetic structure, and test whether the samples could be clustered according to their respective distribution zones, we used structure v.  <dig> . <dig> software  <cit> . the analyses were based on an admixture ancestral model. correlated allele frequencies and a priori sampling locations were used as prior information . locprior was used to detect any further structures that could not be identified by standard settings  <cit> . ten independent runs were performed for each value of k  with a burn-in of  <dig>  <dig>  followed by  <dig>  <dig> mcmc iterations. the most likely value of k was determined using the ∆k criterion  <cit> . structure harvester version  <dig> . <dig> was used to extract the results and created a graphical plot of the ∆k criterion  <cit> . the results were visualized for the best k, with distruct version  <dig>   <cit> .

finally, we computed a neighbour-joining tree   <cit>  to see how populations are genetically linked to one another, and whether clusters could be isolated similarly to the structuring that was found earlier. the njt was constructed with poptree <dig> software  <cit>  based on nei’s standard genetic distance, ds  <cit> . the neighbour-joining tree was bootstrapped  <dig> times.

population genetic bottleneck
m-ratios were estimated to detect historical bottlenecks at each site with the program mpval  <cit> . to interpret results of the m-ratios, we calculated the critical m-ratio  value for each population with the program m-crit, which was developed by jc garza and eg williamson  <cit> . to calculate m
c and m-ratios we used a pre-bottleneck value  and the parameters were set as recommended by jc garza and eg williamson  <cit> . the settings were: a constant mutation rate , which encompassed a range between 10− <dig> and 10− <dig> mutants/generation/locus; probability of changes greater than one step, p
g =  <dig> ; and the size of non-one-step changes, Δg = <dig> . each set of simulations consisted of  <dig>  <dig> iterations with the same values of θ for all sites under a two-phase mutation model . we considered that a m-ratio below the critical value mc was indicative of a population decline. to test for heterozygosity excess, bottleneck version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used with a stepwise mutation model , an infinite allele model , and a two-phase model  with 12 % multistep mutations and variance =  <dig>   <cit> . mode shifts and heterozygosity excess are transient  <cit> . to determine which sampling locations had a significant heterozygote excess across loci, a standardized differences test was used. we also used the graphical method to assess bottleneck-induced distortions of allele frequency distributions that cause alleles at low frequency  to become less abundant than alleles in one or more intermediate allele frequency classes   <cit> . in this method, the probability  of detecting a recent historical bottleneck of fewer than  <dig> breeding individuals is estimated to be 80 % with eight to ten microsatellite loci  <cit> .

RESULTS
variation of genetic diversity
over the entire population, the number of alleles that were observed per locus ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . our results showed that all  <dig> loci were highly polymorphic and that ptr <dig> and ptr <dig> had a high rate of triallelic individuals . these markers were therefore removed from further analysis. at the population level, ar averaged  <dig>  and ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . na ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , with an average of  <dig>  . the mean ne was  <dig> , with lowest value being  <dig>   and the highest being  <dig>  . across all loci, only  <dig> individuals had one or more private alleles. individuals with private alleles were spread across all sampled sites . ho had a mean value of  <dig>  and was lowest in the delta population  and highest in the alders flat population . the mean he was  <dig> , ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the variation in ar and ho is represented on maps  to evaluate the spatial genetic variation visually. higher genetic diversity was observed in alberta and alaska for ar, but only in alberta for ho. we found a positive correlation between ar and he .table  <dig> descriptive genetic composition of  <dig> populus tremuloides populations in northwestern north america

the results of the njt , which were based on nei’s standard genetic distance, were consistent with the results of the mantel test and rda, showing low differentiation between sites. populations that were genetically close to one another are not necessary spatially aggregated. two clusters can be identified at increased confidence levels .

discussion
the purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the origin of trembling aspen in northwestern north america is reflected in the patterns of genetic diversity and population structure. contrary to our hypothesis, microsatellite markers revealed little to no genetic structure in p. tremuloides populations and indicated little isolation by distance . consequently, no divergent populations were observed near supposed refugia suggesting no evidence that beringia or the “ice-free corridor” were refugia for trembling aspen. finally, favorable conditions for sexual reproduction and successful trembling aspen seedling establishment could have contributed to the highest ar and lowest ho that were observed in alberta foothills of the rocky mountains.

genetic diversity and structure
our results support the findings of callahan et al.  <cit> , who found no genetic structuring among populations in the northern part of aspen’s range. trees are known to have low differentiation at neutral molecular markers, indicating high levels of gene flow among populations  <cit> . we observed low levels of differentiation and variation in genetic distance between populations . specific aspen traits, such as outbreeding, wind pollination, aeolian seed dispersal, high seed production and/or longevity, can account for this observation. in addition, there was no pronounced pattern of idb, even at great distances . we were not able to detect local genetic structure patterns. this indicates that aspen populations in the northern portion of the species range experience high levels of gene flow, making it difficult to identify refugia.

the rocky mountains foothills of alberta, which could have remained ice-free during the last glacial maximum , exhibited higher genetic diversity , which is consistent with the observations of callahan et al.  <cit> . moreover, no divergent lineages or specific private alleles were found in this area or north of this region in beringia. the lack of detectable refugia in beringia and in the “ice-free corridor” was due to high levels of gene flow between trembling apsen populations. we agree that the alberta foothills were not an area of admixture because we don’t have highly differentiated populations. more favorable environmental conditions for sexual reproduction and successful trembling aspen seedling establishment in this area  <cit>  may have contributed to increase allelic richness through recombination in populations from the albertan foothills of the rocky mountains. the existence of a refugium in beringia during the lgm has been reported for p. glauca  <cit>  and was consistent with the model simulation of suitable refugial habitats for this species   <cit> , which suggested the presence of p. glauca in beringia during the lmg. moreover, those simulations also suggested the presence of suitable habitats for p. contorta and p. tremuloides in beringia  <cit> . for the closely related species p. balsamifera, recent molecular evidence did not support beringia as a glacial refugium, but confirmed the existence of two distinct clusters in our sample area of northwestern north america  <cit> .

population genetic bottlenecks
the m-ratio bottleneck test proved to be sensitive to the choice of θ, with significant m-ratio values being obtained for all sites using values of θ =  <dig>  the m-ratio detected persistent bottleneck signatures in  <dig> populations with θ =  <dig>  low m-ratios that were detected indicate that these  <dig> populations might have suffered from demographic declines, although they were not severely reduced in their genetic potential. we did not detect strong evidence for excess heterozygosity. consistent results were obtained only for  <dig> population. indeed, wild populations are rarely completely closed and even small numbers of migrants can mask the genetic signature of bottlenecks  <cit> . under tpm, the populations that were subject to a recent reduction in size  were not spatially clustered and were present all over the sampled territory without showing any sign of spatial structure. large effective population size implies that polymorphisms can persist during extended periods of time  <cit> , even during reduction of the species distributional range. at low effective population sizes, asexual reproduction might better preserve heterozygosity than outcrossing at least in the short-term  <cit> , hereby masking recent reductions in population size.

CONCLUSIONS
most of the studies that have detected phylogeographic patterns in boreal tree species in western north america  have used uniparental inherited cpdna  <cit> , mtdna markers  <cit> , or more recently genomic data   <cit> . for p. glauca, ll anderson, fs hu and kn paige  <cit>  suggested that the greater relative rate of mutation of nuclear microsatellites may allow finer scale resolution of the historic dynamics of populations , compared to chloroplast dna that have extremely slow mutation rates . their results with nuclear microsatellite markers support the idea that north-central alaska served as a glacial refugium during the last glacial maximum for white spruce. three genetic groups were detected: the first consisted of one population from north-central alaska ; the second with one population from southern manitoba; and the last group included the remaining  <dig> populations  forming the last group. these results revealed that there is not much structure and differentiation to be found for this boreal species, a result similar to what we found in trembling aspen. for p. tremuloides, callahan et al.  <cit>  found  <dig> distinct groups, with significant correlation of genetic and geographical distances and low ar, solely in the southwestern usa, but nothing in beringia. our study did not find any structuring in northwestern north america. the historic dynamics of the populations vary from one species to another. in conclusion, future studies should combine different approaches and molecular analyses to elucidate the glacial origin and post-glacial migration route in the northwestern part of the species’ range.
