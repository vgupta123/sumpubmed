BACKGROUND
the initial event in taste transduction involves recognition of taste stimuli by plasma membrane-associated receptor proteins. these proteins are concentrated at the apical end of specialized neuro-epithelial cells  found within multicellular end-organs known as taste buds  <cit> . the recognition binding sites for most taste stimuli face the exterior environment. the interaction of a taste stimulus with this recognition site triggers a chain of metabolic and ionic events in the taste cell, leading to alterations in membrane conductance, release of neurotransmitter, and a change in the firing rate of the afferent sensory nerve fibers with which taste cells synapse  <cit> . receptor recognition is, therefore, largely responsible for maintaining the specificity of the taste transduction process.

to date, 7-transmembrane g protein coupled receptors  for three taste modalities have been identified by both molecular cloning and through searches of the human and mouse genome. sweet taste stimuli appear to be recognized by at least one heterodimer  of the three member family of 7tm-gpcr's, the t1r's  <cit> . the taste receptors for sweetness are coupled to changes in intracellular levels of either cyclic nucleotides or polyphosphoinositols  <cit> . two gpcr receptor types have been implicated in the basic taste of umami . one is the heterodimer of t1r1/t1r <dig>  of the same 7tm-gpcr family as the sweet taste receptor dimer  <cit> . another gpcr umami receptor is an n-terminal truncated metabotropic-type  <dig> glutamate receptor  presumably coupled to an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase  <cit> . a third proposed, non-gpcr umami receptor is an nmda-type ionotropic glutamate receptor  <cit> . finally, a family  of 7tm-gpcr's recognizes many bitter taste stimuli  <cit> . these bitter taste receptors are coupled through a gustducin-containing g protein  <cit>  to changes in intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides and polyphosphoinositide metabolites  <cit> .

while these recent discoveries have markedly improved the understanding of taste transduction, it is apparent from neurophysiological, biophysical and biochemical studies that receptors and transduction processes other than the gpcr/second messenger systems are utilized by the sense of taste  <cit> . for example, several taste transduction processes make use of ion channels as the receptor recognition step  <cit> . salty taste is likely transduced by an epithelial sodium channel , and sour taste may also make use of channels such as acid sensing ion channels   <cit>  and the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel  . certain stimuli, such as quinine and perhaps denatonium co-opt potassium channels to alter membrane conductance of taste receptor cells  <cit> . finally, in a variety of species, ligand-gated ion channels have been implicated as taste receptors for a number of stimuli, including sugars in the dog  <cit> , glutamate in mouse  <cit> , nicotinamide in crayfish  <cit> , sugars and amino acids in fleshfly  <cit> , bitter compounds in frog  <cit> , and apparently for amino acids in the channel catfish, ictalurus punctatus  <cit> . little is known about the structure and function of these ligand-gated ion channel receptors  in the taste system nor the extent to which they serve as taste receptors in other species.

to evaluate the role of lgicrs in taste transduction, receptors of this class need to be identified and fully described. to date, a well characterized example of a likely lgicr class of taste receptors is found on the common channel catfish, i. punctatus. the catfish is an advantageous model system for studying taste transduction  <cit>  because it possesses a large number of densely arrayed taste buds across its body surface, particularly on its barbel appendages and gill rakers  <cit> , and shows high specificity and sensitivity to selected amino acids. several taste transduction pathways for amino acids have been identified both biochemically and neurophysiologically, including those recognizing  l-alanine and other small neutral amino acids,  l-proline, and  l-arginine   <cit> .

of these three receptor systems, the one tuned to the amino acid, l-arg, appears to be of particular high specificity and affinity  <cit> . calcium imaging studies on isolated catfish taste receptor cells suggest the presence of at least two subtypes of l-arg-stimulated transduction pathways. in one, l-arg induces a change in intracellular calcium that is independent of extracellular calcium activity. in the other, l-arg induces an increase in intracellular calcium that is dependent upon extracellular calcium. this second type of l-arg induced response is blocked by d-arg, whereas the first type of l-arg induced response is less sensitive to the d-isomer  <cit> . intracellular and patch clamp studies on catfish taste cells are also consistent with there being two subtypes of responses to l-arg  <cit> .

the l-arg induced increase in intracellular calcium independent of extracellular calcium and not blocked by d-arg may utilize a mechanism such as a gpcr-polyphosphoinositol linked pathway with ip <dig> releasing calcium from intracellular stores. the other l-arg-stimulated pathway, showing intracellular changes in calcium dependent upon extracellular calcium and blocked by d-arg, is consistent with an lgicr mechanism. the lgicr mechanism was given additional credence through studies demonstrating that membranes from barbel epithelium , when reconstituted into lipid bilayers, show l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity inhibited by d-arg  <cit> .

using membrane homogenates from catfish barbel epithelium, biochemical binding studies revealed high affinity sites for l-arg that were inhibited by d-arg, l-arginine methyl ester, and to a lesser extent by l-lysine and l-α-amino-β-guanidino propionic acid  <cit> . previous studies had also demonstrated that both of the lectins, ricinus communis agglutinin i  and phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinin , inhibited the binding of l-arg to its presumed receptor sites, and both lectins labelled identical sds-page-separated bands of a barbel membrane preparation  <cit> . l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity of solubilized barbel  membranes reconstituted into lipid bilayers was inhibited by both pha-e  <cit>  and rca-i . in addition, pha-e also labelled the apical membrane of selected taste bud cells and solitary chemoreceptor cells of catfish barbel  <cit> . when reacted against the exterior epithelium of fixed, unpermeabilized catfish barbel, polyclonal antibodies developed against these lectin reactive peptides immuno-labelled the apical membrane of a subset of barbel taste receptor cells  <cit> .

while these prior studies are consistent with the hypothesis that one of the receptors for l-arg is an lgicr, both the neurophysiological studies and the reconstitution experiments could not definitively test this hypothesis. without actually isolating an lgicr for l-arg, it remains possible that a gpcr moiety for l-arg could conceivably be tightly coupled to a separate ion channel.

the purpose of the studies reported here was to investigate the possibility that an lgicr exists for l-arg, by:

 <dig>  biochemically enriching this putative lgicr to near homogeneity, and

 <dig>  biophysically characterizing the l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity of the presumed lgicr at each step of enrichment to

• demonstrate that the same lgicr is being enriched with each step, and

• demonstrate that the ion channel properties and kinetics of the enriched lgicr are similar to those of the presumed lgicr in situ.

this enrichment and characterization are necessary steps towards eventually cloning this putative lgicr.

the data are consistent with the interpretation that a receptor for l-arg can be solubilized in an active state and can be enriched to a point where, upon denaturation and sds-page, material containing receptor-like activity elutes as a single band.

RESULTS
lectin specificity: lectin blots and lectin histochemistry
an sds-page of a detergent-solubilized epithelial membrane fraction from barbel of i. punctatus, called "sp" , revealed numerous proteins labelled by silver stain . yet the lectins, pha-e and rca-i, both clearly labelled only one major glycoprotein band, in the range of  <dig> –  <dig> kda . a few other protein bands were more lightly labelled by these two lectins, including ones near  <dig> –  <dig> kda and ~ <dig> kda. this recognition specificity is notable because previous work had shown that both of these lectins inhibited binding of l-arg to a membrane suspension of barbel epithelium with respective specificity confirmed by control studies using the hapten sugar  <cit> . other lectins that did not inhibit l-arg binding labelled other glycoproteins of barbel epithelium  <cit> .

previous studies showed that the lectin, pha-e, labelled primarily exterior-facing  glycoprotein motifs of the taste buds of catfish barbel  <cit> . however, no comparable labelling studies were carried out using rca-i. since rca-i was used in this current study as an affinity reagent, it was important to establish the labelling specificity of rca-i – conjugated lectin to catfish barbel taste buds. figure 2a shows that rca-i labels primarily the taste buds on the surface of the barbel, with figure 2b showing labelling of two taste buds in a transverse section at higher magnification. figure 2c demonstrates that the lectin labelled primarily the apical region of the taste bud. some of the spotty labelling scattered among the taste bud field  may due to the rca-i recognizing an epitope on solitary chemoreceptor cells . the sccs are a dispersed chemoreception system found in aquatic vertebrates, and are possibly related to the taste system  <cit> . apparent labelling of the catfish scc was reported with pha-e as well  <cit> .

the specificity shown by these lectins in binding inhibition, ion channel conductance inhibition, lectin blots, and lectin histochemistry, all give credence to use of lectin affinity chromatography as the first step in enrichment of l-arg-stimulated channel activity.

enrichment of l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity
step  <dig> – lectin chromatography
since the lectins, rca-i and pha-e, inhibited the binding of l-arg but not of l-alanine  <cit> , the assumption was made that an l-arginine receptor , or a fragment thereof, was among the glycoproteins labelled by these two lectins, and lectin affinity chromatography was, therefore, chosen as the first step in enrichment of this l-argr. verification of the presence of active putative l-argr ion channel in each eluted fraction was assessed by a bilayers – incorporation assay. this assay proved to be more readily performed and provided more reproducible results than soluble binding assays that yielded high non-specific binding and required much more material.

a quantitative protein assessment of the eluted materials from the rca-i column indicated that over 99% of the protein from fraction sp passed through the column unbound. only occasionally did this protein material contain minimal l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity. in contrast, the remaining protein eluted from the affinity column by galactose and reconstituted into lipid bilayers  consistently contained ion channels activated by l-arg and inhibited by d-arg.

silver staining of sds-page separated proteins before  and after  the rca affinity enrichment step revealed numerous proteins from total sp  with fewer and more heavily stained bands of protein present in galactose-eluted fractions . these included primarily protein of molecular weight ~82– <dig> kda, with apparently lower abundance proteins near 115– <dig> kda, 60– <dig> kda, and 40– <dig> kda . the 82– <dig> kda band matched the general position of the principal protein labelled in the lectin blots . the protein eluting at 115– <dig> kda in figure 3b may correspond to the lightly labeled glycoproteins at ~ <dig> kda seen in the lectin blots of figure  <dig>  protein of molecular weight  <dig> –  <dig> kda and  <dig> –  <dig> kda observed in the galactose-eluted protein fraction of figure 3b have no apparent match in the lectin blots of figure  <dig>  these may, possibly, be degradation products of the other protein fractions that are labelled by the lectins or they may be proteins of low abundance, visible here due to the enrichment of protein resulting from the affinity procedure.

on the assumption that the 82– <dig> kda protein was at least a subunit of this l-argr, the sds-page band at 82– <dig> kda was electroeluted and used to develop polyclonal antibodies from three guinea pigs . the affinity purified and pre-treated polyclonal antibodies from two of these guinea pigs proved most specific and these were labelled, "gp1" and "gp <dig> " respectively. in western blots of fraction sp , both of the gp antibodies labelled a wide band between  <dig> and  <dig> kda  and occasionally a second higher molecular weight band near  <dig> kda. in western blots of rca lectin-galactose eluted proteins, a narrower band of 82– <dig> kda was labelled . little gp labelling was seen in western blots from sds-page of the protein not retained by the rca lectin column, but those bands that were labelled were near  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda .

the gp polyclonal antibodies were used as a confirmatory marker of the 82– <dig> kda peptide during subsequent enrichment steps. both the gp <dig> and gp <dig> antibodies labelled the 82– <dig> kda protein band in western blots of an sds solubilized partial membrane preparation from catfish barbel and both immuno-labelled taste cells of the catfish .

step  <dig> – gel filtration
the chaps-solubilized, dialyzed, non-denatured protein eluted from the galactose wash of the lectin column was applied to a sephacryl s- <dig> hr column and eluted with tris/chaps. each protein-containing peak of the elution was assayed for l-arg-stimulated channel activity and subjected to sds-page with silver staining and western blotting against the gp <dig> antibody. only protein from the first peak, in fractions  <dig> and  <dig>   contained l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity . silver staining of material in these first two fractions run on sds-page revealed a prominent band at 82– <dig> kda . the broad band near 110– <dig> kda seen after lectin chromatography  was not seen while protein at 60– <dig> kda and 40– <dig> kda remained. the corresponding western blot  demonstrated that the antigen to which gp <dig> was developed was still present in the active fraction.

step  <dig> – ion exchange chromatography
as a final enrichment step eluted material from fractions  <dig> and  <dig> of the sephacryl column were lyophilised and resuspended into start buffer  and loaded on a hitrap q anion exchange column. both the ph  <dig> and ph  <dig> elution resulted in protein being released from the column, with the majority of protein eluting at ph <dig>  however, only the ph  <dig> fraction contained l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity when reconstituted into lipid bilayers.

a silver stain of an sds-page of the ph  <dig> eluent showed a deeply staining band at 82– <dig> kda along with weak staining above  <dig> kda and in the  <dig> kda range . there was also an almost complete loss of other stained bands observed in sds-page of protein from the previous enrichment steps . the corresponding western blot of  <dig>  μg of the ph  <dig> eluent showed very strong reactivity at 82– <dig> kda . the sds-page of the ph  <dig> eluent showed a faint band at 82– <dig> kda with other less intense bands at lower molecular weight. this ph  <dig> eluent may contain an inactive or partially denatured form of the l-argr.

immunohistochemistry of gp <dig> and gp <dig> on catfish barbel
the gp antibodies were developed against the 82– <dig> kda fraction of solubilized catfish barbel membranes, since it was a band of this molecular weight that was labelled by the lectins, pha-e and rca-i. while it is expected that gp <dig> and gp <dig> would label an 82– <dig> kda band by western blots, the fact that the gp <dig> and gp <dig> antibodies faithfully marked each enriched fraction that exhibited l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity  suggests that they are immuno labels of the receptor. as such, their localization within the barbel may be a marker for this presumed l-argr.

characterization of the rca lectin-, sephacryl s  <dig> gel-, and ion exchange-protein reconstituted into lipid bilayers
lgicr enrichment was followed and verified by measuring the l-arg-stimulated conductance of lipid bilayers  into which the protein fractions derived from each purification step were fused. nearly identical l-arg-stimulated single channel activity was observed from active fractions of all three steps: the galactose-eluted protein from the rca lectin column, the protein of the first peak, fractions  <dig> &  <dig>  of the material eluted from the sephacryl s- <dig> column, and the protein of the ph  <dig> elution from the ion exchange column. the fact that consistent and nearly identical l-arg-stimulated activity was observed with material from each subsequent enrichment step indicates that the enrichment procedures were sufficiently benign so as to permit the retention of lgicr-type activity and, presumably, native receptor conformation.

general agonist/antagonist channel properties. figure  <dig> illustrates single channel activities observed during the enrichment steps. since active material from each of the three steps yielded almost identical channel properties , only that activity seen with fractions  <dig> and  <dig>  off of the sephacryl s- <dig> column is shown here. the data of figure  <dig> are from the same experiment.

in lipid bilayers into which active material had been fused, but in the absence of added l-arg, no spontaneous channel activity was observed . addition of  <dig> μm l-arg to the cis side buffer solution induced appearance of ion channels . l-arg-stimulated channel activity in positive fractions from all columns was readily blocked by the addition of  <dig> μm d-arg to the same side of the chamber wherein l-arg had been added .  induced channel activity.)

while  <dig> μm l-arg was generally used in the screening and assay procedures, we estimate that the threshold for l-arg-induced channel activity of the solubilized putative l-argr is about  <dig> μm l-arg.

in addition to inhibition by d-arg, the lectins, rca-i and pha-e , also inhibited the l-arg-induced ion channel activity. in contrast, none of the antibodies developed to the denatured 82– <dig> kda proteins inhibited l-arg stimulated ion channel activity. neither l-alanine nor l-proline  activated the ion channels stimulated by l-arg.

amplitude histogram
cation/anion selectivity & current/voltage relationship
the cation-anion selectivity of l-arg activated channels found in material contained in fractions  <dig> &  <dig> off the sephacryl column was determined for na+ and cl-. a potential of zero current  was measured after formation of a 4-fold transmembrane concentration gradient of electrolyte  across the bilayer containing a few ion channels. the average reversal potential  elicited by voltage ramps  was - <dig> ±  <dig> mv. this value corresponds to weak cation selectivity .

the current-voltage relationships for l-arg activated channels formed by active protein fractions from all three enrichment steps are illustrated in figure  <dig>  the data are well fit by a linear regression  with slopes of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ps for channels formed by protein from the rca-i lectin column , protein from sephacryl s- <dig> hr column  and protein from the ph  <dig> fraction of the ion-exchange column , respectively. from these current-voltage relationships it follows that the conductance of the channels from protein at any stage in the enrichment process are nearly identical, and that l-arg activated ion channels are essentially potential-independent.

discussion
ligand-gated ion channel receptors  may be used for selected stimuli of several taste modalities. in spite of their likely role in taste, little is known about these lgicrs  <cit> . the best characterised apparent taste lgicrs that recognise non-ionic stimuli are those of the catfish, i. punctatus. this animal possesses apparent lgicrs of low affinity for l-proline and of high affinity for l-arg  <cit> .

the observation that l-arg acts as a stimulus for the taste system of the channel catfish was first reported by caprio  <cit> . subsequent neurophysiological and biochemical binding studies demonstrated that, unlike most other vertebrate taste receptors, the catfish taste receptor for l-arg is of both high specificity and high sensitivity  <cit> . contemporaneous neurophysiological cross-adaptation and single unit studies indicated that l-arg stimulates unique sites independent of those for other amino acids such as l-alanine or l-proline  <cit> .

the receptor sites for l-arg have narrow structural requirements, with only a few structural analogs of l-arg acting as cross-adapting stimuli  <cit> . the receptor binding studies found a high affinity site for l-arg, with kd of 20– <dig> nm, and demonstrated inhibition of l-arg binding by d-arg, l-arginine methyl ester, and to a lesser extent by l-lysine and l-α-amino-β-guanidino propionic acid  <cit> . other amino acids were without effect at reasonable levels. interestingly, l-arg and d-arg are non-reciprocal cross adaptors, where neural adaptation to d-arg eliminates responses to l-arg, while adaptation to l-arg still leaves some response to d-arg  <cit> . this non-reciprocal cross-adaptation predicts the presence of a receptor site for d-arg and suggests that any receptor for l-arg – be it a gpcr or an lgicr – should be sensitive to d-arg. the fact that no responses to d-arg were ever observed in the bilayer experiments suggests that the major receptor for d-arg is a gpcr. consistent with these receptor specificities is the behavioural observation that at micromolar levels, l-arg induces oropharyngeal motor behavior in i. punctatus  <cit>  with d-arginine acting as a partial antagonist of this behavior  <cit> .

more recently, whole cell patch clamp and calcium imaging of isolated catfish taste receptor cells, along with earlier in situ intracellular electrophysiological recordings, indicated that the majority of l-arg-induced depolarizations are generated by inward currents  <cit> . as predicted by neurophysiological cross-adaptation studies  <cit>  and consistent with biochemical binding experiments  <cit>  the increases in intracellular ca2+ activity observed in taste cells stimulated by l-arg could be blocked by d-arg  <cit> .

studies in our laboratory demonstrated that plasma membrane vesicles from barbel epithelium incorporated into lipid bilayers displayed l-arg -stimulated ion channel activity that was inhibited by d-arg  <cit> . no channel activity was observed toward l-alanine, but another, apparently less abundant, channel was stimulated by mm levels of l-proline, with the l-proline response being inhibited by d-proline. the l-arg-stimulated responses were not inhibited by d-proline, nor were the l-proline responses inhibited by d-arg  <cit> . the l-arg-stimulated channels were found to be 50– <dig> ps in size, cation selective, but of low ion specificity. in contrast to the taste system, the olfactory system of the catfish transduces the stimulus, l-arg and some other basic amino acids apparently through a gpcr  <cit>  as does the olfactory system of goldfish  <cit> . in addition, l-arg is an appetitive stimulus for the leech, hirudo medicinalis, where the transduction process for l-arg can be influenced by bitter stimuli, suggesting an integration at the receptor cell level  <cit> 

preliminary reports on the localization of an l-argr showed that the antibodies, gp <dig>  and the lectin, pha-e, when incubated with intact, unfixed barbels, labelled exterior-facing epitopes on catfish barbel taste buds  <cit>  and sccs scattered in the epithelium among taste buds  <cit> . immunoelectron microscopy using gp <dig> revealed labelling primarily on those cells of the taste bud containing large microvilli  <cit> . because these data were of surface labelling only, the labelling specificity towards other areas of the taste bud and the barbel epidermis for gp <dig> and the lectins was not known. this current report demonstrates primarily apical labelling of taste buds by both conjugated rca-i, gp <dig> and gp <dig> . the scattered punctuate labelling seen with both rca-i and the gp antibodies may represent epitope recognition on solitary chemoreceptor cells , the apical processes of which were previously shown to label with pha-e  <cit> . as the secondary antibody controls suggest  very little of this punctuate labelling can be attributed to a second antibody effect.

considering collectively the neurophysiological, biochemical, behavioural, biophysical and localization data, a putative receptor for l-arg emerges as one of high structural specificity, with d-arg acting as an antagonist, one of high sensitivity, and one expressed in the apical membrane of a specific sub-class of taste receptor cells. yet, because the previous biophysical studies were carried out with intact cells, epithelial homogenates or reconstituted membrane vesicles, the data are insufficient to permit a distinction between the l-argr as a single lgicr macromolecular complex and the receptor as two separate entities, a recognition molecule coupled to ion channel activity. to help make this distinction, solubilization and enrichment of the receptor were required. we assumed that if receptor activity survived solubilization and increasing enrichment, and if this receptor appeared to purify as a unitary entity by sds-page, then it is likely that the major receptor for l-arg is indeed a lgicr.

this enrichment procedure was also a necessary first step in cloning the receptor, since partial amino acid sequences may be obtained from the purified product.

enrichment of the putative l-argr
the initial enrichment step of lectin affinity was predicated upon the observation that the lectins, rca-i and pha-e, inhibited the specific binding of l-arg to its presumed receptor sites  <cit> , and that pha-e and rca-i inhibited l-arg-stimulated conductance activity of catfish barbel  membranes reconstituted into lipid bilayers  <cit> . in addition, both lectins labelled only a few protein bands of an sds-page of barbel sp, and only one major band, that near 82– <dig> kda, was common between the two . both conjugated rca-i and pha-e labelled cells within the taste buds .

lectin affinity chromatography employing agarose bound rca-i was therefore used to achieve an initial partial enrichment of the putative l-argr. rca-i was chosen for lectin affinity because in our hands it was more stable and easier to work with than the agarose bound pha-e. in pilot studies, lectin affinity chromatography with pha-e led to results similar to those obtained with rca-i.

the two additional enrichment procedures using sephacryl-s <dig> and hitrap q ion exchange were chosen to further enrich the putative l-argr because both could be carried out using solubilization buffers that were less likely to destroy the activity of the receptor and both are standard biochemical purification techniques. each chromatography step that retained l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity resulted in increasingly concentrated and increasingly purified protein of molecular weight near 82– <dig> kda. this enrichment is readily seen in sds-page of figure  <dig>  where the protein profile changes dramatically over the course of each chromatography step. the western blots of material from each step  suggest a substantial enrichment of the 82– <dig> kda protein.

throughout enrichment, the 82– <dig> kda band was consistently recognized by the gp <dig> and gp <dig> antibodies in western blots . these blots suggest that the same entity labelled by the lectins was retained and enriched through the course of each chromatography step. the western blots also speak to the specificity of the antibodies, gp <dig> and gp <dig>  in that both antibodies labelled almost exclusively the 82– <dig> kda band. the subsequent observation that gp <dig> and gp <dig> recognized epitopes at the apical region of the taste bud  indicates that at least a portion of the proteins in the 82– <dig> kda region are taste cell-related, membrane associated and, given the biophysical characteristics, likely receptors.

while the 82– <dig> kda protein may be a major constituent of the active ion channel complex, the actual molecular weight of the active receptor, and therefore some estimate of its quarternary composition, was difficult to determine. attempts at running native gels led to inconsistent findings. of the procedures used for enrichment, the sephacryl column was the one that could, theoretically, at least, give an estimate of the size of the complex. using this column, all of the l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity was located within the initial eluted peak . calibration of the column suggested a molecular weight of >  <dig> kda for eluted material at this initial peak. however, this high apparent molecular weight may not represent the actual weight of the unitary lgicr, since, like many other lgicrs, the l-argr may form clusters  <cit> . theoretically, use of sephacryl 400hr should be able to resolve such high molecular weights. however, when sephacryl 400hr was used, ion channel activity was spread across many eluted fractions, making estimates of unitary molecular weight impossible.

after these enrichment procedures, the l-arg-stimulated ion channel activity was retained and the 82– <dig> kda protein fraction was greatly purified. the correlation of these two observations suggests that protein in the 82– <dig> kda range is at least part of the l-argr.

biophysical characteristics of the putative l-argr
the biophysical characteristics of the l-arg-stimulated channels reconstituted from each step in the enrichment scheme remained nearly unchanged from those described for the channel observed in native membrane fragments  <cit> :

 <dig>  both channels were activated by the same range of concentration of l-arg and blocked by the same concentration range of d-arg ;

 <dig>  neither were activated by l-alanine nor by l-proline;

 <dig>  both displayed similar amplitude histograms ;

 <dig>  both had similar unitary conductance , with the enriched channel displaying unitary conductance of  <dig> +/-  <dig> ps , and the channel in situ displaying two conductance ranges,  <dig> –  <dig> and  <dig> –  <dig> ps. this difference is likely due to the difference in buffers, where the bilayer studies were performed in nacl/cacl2/mops, while the reconstituted membrane in situ studies were performed with a complex ringer buffer ;

 <dig>  both channel preparations when stimulated by l-arg exhibit linear current voltage relationship .

the results of this study demonstrate that the isolated channel protein shows recognition-specificity for l-arg and acts as a non-specific ion channel upon binding l-arg, properties consistent with the in situ activity of the putative l-argr and consistent with expected taste receptor criteria.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the data presented here suggest that one major taste receptor for l-arg in the catfish, i. punctatus, is a ligand-gated ion channel receptor. the active receptor was biochemically enriched from taste bud-containing epithelium and biophysically validated. immunohistochemical studies using an antibody raised against peptides labelled by lectins that inhibited the binding of l-arg to a likely receptor revealed specific labelling at the apical region of the taste bud. analogous with other lgicrs, taste receptor cell depolarization to l-arg is suggested through l-arg binding to a receptor site that is associated with and activates an ion channel of low ion selectivity. in the animal, activation of this channel by l-arg or other select agonists will open the channel and allow influx of na+ and ca2+, present in the mucus covering the taste epithelium  <cit> , into the receptor cell. alternatively, given the relatively low cation/anion ratio, at least part of this charge could be carried by efflux of cl-. this flow of charge will result in cellular depolarization, release of neurotransmitter to the innervating sensory nerve, and transmission of the taste signal to the central nervous system. this enrichment procedure can be used to generate sufficient material for obtaining partial peptide sequences necessary for eventual cloning of this lgicr.
