BACKGROUND
membrane-trafficking is a crucial process in eukaryotic cells. in recent years, the combination of structural biology, molecular cell biology and bio-informatics has allowed the definition of many of the key proteins families involved. genome-wide analyses of both animals and plants, known to possess complex and tightly regulated protein-trafficking systems, have shown extensive sets of such membrane-trafficking protein machinery  <cit> . among these, the soluble nsf attachment protein receptors  play a central role in the control of membrane fusion and of protein and lipid traffic  <cit> . snares have been divided into major groups based on either their presence in the vesicle  or target membrane  or based on the presence of a conserved critical residue in the  <dig> polar layer, either arginine  or glutamine   <cit> .

despite being best characterised in animals, plants and fungi, snares are, in fact, conserved features of the eukaryotic membrane-trafficking system. comparative genomics and molecular phylogenetics have shown that the four major snare super-families  were already present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor   <cit> . the syntaxins or qa-snare super-family has been examined in detail, demonstrating that even the five major organelle and pathway specific families had already evolved before the emergence of the current eukaryotic super-groups  <cit> .

the cytoplasmic region of some r-snares, the short vamps or "brevins" , consists of simply the snare motif. however, many r-snares also possess a conserved amino-terminal longin domain , thus characterizing a large family of long vamps or "longins"  <cit> . the longins are divided in three main families based on homology to prototypical proteins ykt6p, sec22b and ti-vamp/vamp7; the ld of ykt <dig> and sec22b show the same globular fold, based on a five-stranded β-sheet core sandwiched by one α-helix on one side and two α-helices on the other  <cit> . the ld of ykt6p contains a hydrophobic patch that can inhibit the formation of a fusion complex by intramolecular binding to the coiled-coil domain ; mutation of a conserved phe residue within this patch abrogates this interaction  <cit> . recently, residues in the snare motif that are crucial to bind the ld have been identified for sec22b  <cit> . many of these residues are conserved and the same as those involved in snare motif binding in ti-vamp/vamp <dig>  <cit> . intriguingly, the ld of human ti-vamp/vamp <dig> is capable of playing a dual role because, in addition to negatively regulating the ability of either ti-vamp/vamp <dig> or a ld-synaptobrevin chimera to participate in snare complexes, it is also able to target ti-vamp/vamp <dig> to the late endosomal compartment by interacting with the δ subunit of the ap <dig> adaptor complex  <cit>  and to interact with the arfgap hrb in retrieval from the plasma membrane  <cit> . such capacity to regulate subcellular localization  is shown also by the ld of the arabidopsis thaliana vamp <dig> proteins  <cit>  and of mammalian ykt <dig>  <cit> . in mammals, the ld seems also to play a relevant role in regulating neuronal development, as it is crucial to the control of neurite outgrowth  <cit> .

several lines of evidence suggest ld proteins play a central role in trafficking. firstly, longins are the prototypical r-snares and are essential in eukaryotes, whereas brevins are limited to opisthokonts and synaptobrevins are even more limited taxonomically  <cit> . secondly, the ld sensu stricto can also be present in non-snare proteins: e.g. mammals have - in addition to the snare longin sec22b - two homologous proteins, sec22a and sec22c, which lack the snare portion but are involved in early secretory trafficking  <cit> . as well, alternative splicing of the sybl <dig> gene results in encoding the snare longin ti-vamp/vamp <dig> and two isoforms showing reverse domain architecture: isoform ''c''  and isoform ''b'' . finally, the longin-like fold is not limited to members of the snare proteins family but rather is shared by other important trafficking protein families, such as the σ and μ subunits in clathrin adaptor complexes  <cit> , the sedl/trs20p subunit of the trapp complex  <cit> , the srx domain of the srα subunit of the signal recognition particle   <cit> , as well as the chips and duf <dig> proteins  <cit> . very recently, the syndecan-binding protein synbindin, involved in neuronal membrane trafficking, has been found to show a ''special'' ld-like fold, structurally related to sedl and split by a loop insertion corresponding to an atypical pdz domain  <cit> .

although the three longin families  have been identified in comparative genomic analyses of snare proteins from many eukaryotes  <cit> , their evolution and diversity has not been fully explored. it is thus not entirely clear whether or not they represent robust clades that branched before the extant eukaryotic supergroups and whether there are any, as-yet, unreported longin families. in order to analyze the complement of ld proteins both in number and genomic structure, we have undertaken a thorough bioinformatic analysis of publicly available completed genomes from diverse eukaryotes, with special emphasis on plant genomes, from both land plants and algae. trafficking in plants is not only involved in canonical cellular processes but also in regulation of cytokinesis, gravitropism, responses to pathogens and abiotic stress  <cit> . as such, plants provide an important handle for shedding light on the pivotal role of trafficking in regulating  cell function and differentiation.

here, the three major longin families are demonstrated to be robustly monophyletic and to each contain the diversity of eukaryotes, thus confirming that the gene duplications giving rise to these families pre-date the lcea  <cit> . in addition to the known longin families, however, our analysis has allowed the definition of a novel, plant-specific, ld protein family, the phytolongins. we here characterise this family in silico in terms of genomic complement and structure, protein domain architecture and topology and structural modeling: this shows that a well-conserved n-terminal ld is present in members of this family, as is a predicted c-terminal trans-membrane region. moreover, the unique central region of phytolongins - showing neither detectable homology to the snare motif nor conservation of hydrophobic heptad repeats - is putatively able to intramolecularly bind the longin domain through a short, snare-like motif. phylogenetic analysis pin-points the phytolongins as a derivative of the plant specific vamp <dig> longin family and allows elucidation of phytolongin family evolution.

RESULTS
comparative genomics identifies unusual longin proteins
in order to address the evolution and diversity of longins and ld proteins in eukaryotes, we scanned available completed genomes from across eukaryotic diversity. our sampling was intentionally broad and shallow in most lineages in order to obtain a tractable dataset of ld family proteins for analysis. this sampling included at least one representative of each of the five eukaryotic supergroups  <cit>  for which genome sequences are publicly available. however, we sampled the plant lineage in considerable depth. this included representatives of dicots , monocots , moss , as well as the multicellular chlorophyte alga volvox carteri and single-celled chlorophyte and prasinophyte algae .

genomes, transcriptomes and corresponding inferred proteomes of such organisms were scanned by iterative homology searching. originally, we used the sequences of all known longin proteins from arabidopsis thaliana as probes to scan genomes/transcriptomes/proteomes of the organisms listed above. homologous extracted hits were in turn used as probes for iterative scanning steps: this process stopped when the search resulted in extracting no further homologous sequences. as a next step, all non-arabidopsis candidate homologues were used as blast query sequences to be compared to arabidopsis thaliana longins in order to group them based on classification of the main longin subfamilies   <cit>  and further division of plant vamp <dig> proteins in two classes: vamp <dig> and vamp <dig>  <cit> . in accordance with previous studies, homologues of the three major ld family proteins were identified from the vast majority of eukaryotic genomes .

the distribution and organization of the "classic" plant longins is presented in additional file  <dig>  similar to animals, algae genomes have single ykt <dig> and sec22b genes. however, duplication of ykt <dig> is conserved in all land plants, which also show two to four sec22b-like genes. in plants, which indeed lack orthologues of animal brevins  <cit> , a progressive amplification of the vamp <dig> longin subfamily is observed  <cit> . we found that - in all scanned complete genomes - the vamp <dig> complement is larger than vamp71; moreover, the single vamp <dig> gene of ostreococcus tauri belongs to the vamp <dig> group . in general, land plants show a 2- <dig> fold amplification of the complement of classical longins with respect to algae: 12- <dig>  vs. 3- <dig>  genes. this detailed examination of the longin superfamily organisation emphasizes the increased trafficking complexity that has accompanied the colonization of land by the streptophytes and also allowed us to identify several unusual plant longin proteins.

vamp <dig> possesses a unique acidic loop in its longin domain
since arabidopsis thaliana vamp <dig>  shows an insertion of several amino acids in the ld sequence, which is unique amongst vamp <dig> proteins  <cit> , we performed a comparative sequence and structural analysis of this region in plant longins. modeling of the lds of arabidopsis thaliana vamp <dig> and of its closest homologue vamp <dig>  shows that the insertion sequence corresponds to an acidic extension of the loop between helices α- <dig> and α- <dig> of the ld . intriguingly, this loop in the ld of sec22b is part of a conserved interaction surface involved in binding to sec <dig> within the sec23/24/22b complex and in binding and packaging sec22b by copii   <cit> . when considering that such ld-complex binding is crucial to subcellular targeting, the acidic loop is likely to mediate/regulate the specific scl of vamp <dig> by steric hindrance and/or polar/charge interactions. vamp <dig> are present only in seed plants   <cit> . in more ancient divisions of streptophytes  the polar loop is already apparent; however, it is shorter and less acidic than in flowering plants . it is particularly well conserved in magnoliids, monocotyledons and eudicotyledons .

plants possess non-snare longin proteins
a few non-snare ld proteins have been reported, including mammalian sec <dig> gene isoforms sec22a and sec22c  <cit> ; we report here that plants also have non-snare sec <dig> genes. a sec22-like rice protein  - confirmed by flcdna  and by ests  - shows a complete ld sequence but lacks both the snare motif and the c-terminal tmd. when comparing the transcript to the corresponding genomic sequence , it is clear that this results from genomic deletion of the region encoding the snare motif in sec <dig> paralogues. although the exon encoding the tmd is conserved, this domain is lost because of a frame shift resulting from the new exon-intron boundary. hence this sec22-like protein from rice is expected to correspond to a longin domain, with no further regions. this is not surprising, when considering that single-domain proteins based on the longin fold  are known to play important roles in trafficking multi-subunit complexes.

identification and primary structure of the phytolongins
overall, our comparative genomic survey identified several unusual aspects of longin proteins in plants. however most surprisingly, in addition to members of the three well-known longin families, land plant genomes encode a family of previously unreported ld proteins which - based on in silico characterization  - were named "phytolongins". a first set of phytolongins was originally identified using vamp <dig> sequences from each species as sequence probes. extracted hits, used as probes in iterated search cycles, allowed for the identification of further homologous sequences. phytolongins share, with all longins, the n-terminal ld sequence and, with vamp7-like and sec22b-like longins, the c-terminus. topology and tmd predictions , as well as presence of highly conserved residues in the c-terminus identify a putative tmd, suggesting that most probably phytolongins are integral membrane proteins sharing topology with longins.

however, the r-snare motif of longins is replaced in all phytolongins by a central region  of unknown function consisting of roughly 60- <dig> amino acids . when using whole phytolongin sequences or sequence fragments corresponding to their phyl regions as probes to scan non-redundant protein or dna sequence databases, no similarity to either snare motifs or any other domain was found. further attempts, performed optimizing blast parameters in order to extract weakly similar sequences, confirmed that phyl sequences are unique and specific to phytolongins. moreover, all homology searches confirmed the absence of phytolongin orthologues in organisms other than land plants.

in order to assess the conservation of genomic organisation of the plant longins, comparison of genomic structures  was performed, with the verified genomic structure of each longin gene from the scanned complete plant genomes determined by comparing genomic vs. cdna sequence. figure  <dig> illustrates conservation and variation of gene splitting patterns in plant longins. color-coding in the figure emphasizes that some exon patterns between land plants and algae are better conserved in some longin subfamilies than in others. for example, in land plants, a four-exon pattern is fully conserved in all vamp <dig> genes , whereas the single vamp <dig> genes from algae show a different eight-exon pattern and do not share exon-intron junctions with land plant orthologues. similarly, all ykt <dig> genes from land plants share the same six-exon pattern, which is quite different from the mono/bi-exonic pattern of algae genes. sec <dig> genes from land plants show a conserved gene-splitting organization ; however, the three-exon organization of their 3' halves  is conserved also in algae. the picture of vamp <dig> gene organisation is more complex: most land plant genes show a five-exon division of the coding sequences, but three vamp <dig> genes are monoexonic in moss and one of the arabidopsis thaliana vamp <dig> genes shows merging of the last two exons . comparison with algal vamp <dig> genes shows conservation of some splitting points: for instance, division between first  and second  exon. deeper sequence comparison confirms conservation also in splice junction sequence boundaries. two of the three longins of ostreococcus tauri are monoexonic, and the third is biexonic. finally, the phytolongin genes are monoexonic in both dicots and monocots , whereas moss phytolongins are biexonic. overall this analysis confirmed transcription of several, but not all, predicted genes and identified novel, unreported gene structures. it also confirmed expression of phytolongins from four plant taxa, validating the predicted genes.

domain architecture of the phytolongins
since the profile for the ld  was detected in several, but not all phytolongin sequences, structural modeling of both profile-positive and profile-negative phytolongins was performed.

in order to obtain a model including both the ld and phyl regions, whole phytolongins were used as sequence probes in fold recognition based modeling. phyre  <cit>  confirmed that the ld of ti-vamp/vamp <dig> ld is the best available template for a phytolongin ld; in addition however, it was also able to propose a model superimposed onto the structure of subunit sec22b of the copii complex recently solved   <cit> . in particular, the model in figure 5a shows that a short peptide from the phyl region  is close to the α1-β <dig> region  of the ld, i.e. to the snare-binding site  <cit> .

threading predictions were iterated and the presence of the putative ld binding motif was confirmed for the phyl regions of all phytolongins . when considering that the α1-β <dig> region is also a binding partner for the snare-like region of hrb  <cit> , it is not surprising to see that the putative ld-binding peptides of the phyl regions are aligned in the model to the ld binding motif of the template and that the putative interaction is based on polar rather than hydrophobic interactions . figure 5c also shows that the nt half of the phyl region, including its putative ld binding motif, shares with snare motifs some heptadic, hydrophobic layers . absence of overall homology to the snare motif, presence of a putative ld-binding motif and conservation of the heptadic layers only in the nt half suggest that the phyl region might share with the snare motif capacity to bind the ld, but not to participate in snare bundles, thus resembling the snare-like region of hrb  <cit> .

the phyl region is likely to have strongly diverged from the snare motif by point mutations and/or sequence insertions. high divergence between the phyl region and snare motif, together with α <dig> sequence divergence between phytolongins and longins lds suggest that different longin domain proteins may show different binding properties. indeed, even among snare longins from the same organism - e.g. yeast - the intramolecular binding mechanism can be either clearly apparent  or not detected . putative binding of the phyl region to the ld is in agreement with evidence that non-snare proteins can also bind the ld  <cit> .

in order to obtain further functional predictions, phyl region sequences from all identified phytolongins were scanned for the presence of prosite motifs/signatures . when searching for degenerate patterns, putative calcium binding regions were consistently found  but no positional conservation of these putative sites in multiple alignment was observed. while false positives among degenerate versions of low complexity motifs are quite common, this low confidence prediction is reported because of the special significance of calcium binding in trafficking proteins  <cit> .

overall, the domain modeling shows that, despite no detectable sequence homology with snare motifs, phytolongins are bona fide longin proteins with conserved longin domain structure and a potentially conserved binding mechanism between the ld and phyl motif.

evolution of the phytolongins
having established that the phytolongins are ld proteins, we wanted to establish the longin family from which they are derived. a variety of datasets were created to address this question and were analysed using bayesian and two methods of protein maximum-likelihood phylogeny. initial analyses of longins from diverse eukaryotes clearly resolve the phytolongins as a monophyletic group to the exclusion of all other sequences. the overall analysis  did not resolve the placement of this clade but did resolve the ykt <dig> sequences as monophyletic  indicating that the phytolongins are not derived from within this family. subsequent analysis further excluded the sec <dig> family as a source of the phytolongins, with a strongly supported node resolving the sec <dig> family and allowing the establishment of the phytolongins as embedded within the plant specific vamp <dig> clade .

in order to further investigate the internal evolution of the phytolongin family, a final dataset was analysed . independent clades of phytolongins were observed in the bryophytes , gymnosperms  and the angiosperms. although the node separating the bryophytes from the other plant phytolongins is poorly resolved in figure  <dig>  subsequent analyses provided more robust support . within the angiosperms, two major clades are apparent. although the inclusion of the monocot sequences in these clades is unclear, the nodes supporting the dicot sequences in each clade are very well supported .

putative involvement of phytolongins in subcellular trafficking
preliminary data from subcellular location prediction software applied to the arabidopsis thaliana phytolongins gave results inconsistent between the different algorithms and, for the arabidopsis thaliana vamps, results inconsistent with experimentally established location of the proteins . consequently this method of analysis was not pursued. nonetheless, it is possible to speculate on the possible scl of phytolongins and their involvement in plant subcellular trafficking based on their similarity and derivation from the plant specific clade of vamp <dig> proteins.

we performed an analysis of percent identity between the animal ti-vamp/vamp <dig>  arabidopsis thaliana vamp homologues and the four arabidopsis phytolongins, considering  the full-length sequence,  the ld region only and  the ct region only . animal vamp <dig> proteins are more similar to the four vamp <dig> than to the seven vamp <dig> and, intriguingly, such difference is dependent on divergence at the ld sequence. in the ct region, the vamp <dig> and vamp <dig> share a range in similarity to the animal homologues between 38-42%, as do lds from animal vamp <dig> to plant vamp <dig> lds. however, similarity between the animal ti-vamp/vamp <dig> and vamp <dig> lds is roughly ten percent lower . it is therefore noteworthy that all four phytolongins lds are more similar to lds from vamp <dig> proteins than lds from vamp <dig>  it has to be stressed here that subcellular targeting of longins is mediated by the ld  <cit> , acting as a dominant signal in chimeric constructs combining domains from vamp <dig> proteins with different scl  <cit>  moreover, in addition to a similar ld, vamp <dig> proteins and phytolongins are likely to share a conserved intramolecular binding mechanism resulting in a closed conformation in the conformational epitope mediating subcellular targeting.

while the vamp <dig> homologues are localized to the golgi body and vacuole, all vamp <dig> proteins localise to the pm/endosomal compartment  <cit> , apart from vamp <dig>  and vamp <dig> . since the phytolongins share higher similarity with the vamp <dig> family, we tentatively speculate that the phytolongins might be involved in events at the pm/endosomes as well. however, given that multiple linear and often short, cryptic motifs and conformational epitopes, as well as binding partners and post-translational modifications, can finely tune subcellular sorting, experimental evidence is expected to shed light on the scl, interactions and role in trafficking of this novel protein family.

CONCLUSIONS
our bioinformatic analysis of longin proteins has both verified the ancient nature of the three r-snare longin subfamilies and identified the phytolongins, a previously undescribed ld protein family, specific to plants. that phytolongins are present in multiple plant genomes, spanning the diversity of land plants, and that phytolongin transcripts are available from several plant est projects speak to the validity of the predicted novel genes. the expanded nature of this gene family in many taxa speaks to its potential importance in plant biology.

in addition to this new family of non-snare longin proteins, we identified several splice-variants of canonical longins, missing the snare motif. these, together with the presence of other non-snare longin proteins, and the conserved longin-like fold in a variety of other trafficking proteins, all suggest that the longin domain may be a more central structural feature to membrane-trafficking in eukaryotic cells than is currently recognised. since the longin-like fold is present in diverse trafficking machinery, involved in vesicle fusion, vesicle formation and even the signal recognition particle, we propose that the longin-like domain should join other prominent structural protein elements, such as the alpha-solenoid, and beta-propeller domains  <cit>  and monomeric gtpases, in the list of the primordial building blocks that were involved in the earliest evolution of a eukaryotic membrane-trafficking system.
