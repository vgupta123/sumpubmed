BACKGROUND
avian genome sequences were first obtained for well-studied model systems for which there was a long history of multidisciplinary research, namely the chicken gallus gallus <cit>  and zebra finch taeniopygia guttata <cit> . but now genomes are starting to appear along lines of interest such as other agricultural species , members of adaptive radiations , species with traits of interest such as vocal learning  and systems with possible incipient speciation . genome-scale resources for non-traditional model organisms have become a reality over a short period of time, due in a large part to the commercialization of sequencing-by-synthesis  technology  <cit> . initial examinations of these genomes have revealed that there is a high degree of synteny among avian species, confirming hypotheses from cytogenetic studies  <cit> . although  <dig> million years of evolution separate chickens and turkeys, only  <dig> minor chromosome rearrangements were detected between the two and their karyotypes are strikingly similar  <cit> . chicken and zebra finch  also exhibit a high degree of synteny and conservation of karyotype  <cit> . however, recent work shows that small inversions may be common when comparing distantly-related avian taxa  <cit> .

there are over  <dig>  passerine species with many unique traits and adaptations  <cit> . each additional passerine genome  <cit>  that is sequenced offers an opportunity to identify different genes under selection and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying avian adaptations  <cit> . the hawaiian honeycreepers are an endemic hawaiian passerine adaptive radiation in the cardueline finch subfamily drepanidinae  <cit> , and display a tremendous diversity of plumages, beak shapes  and niches  <cit> . molecular analyses indicate that the radiation is sister to the eurasian carpodacus rosefinches, and dates to about  <dig>  million years ago  <cit> . adaptive radiations have long been recognized for their value as evolutionary case studies and their usefulness in understanding adaptive evolutionary processes. the hawaiian honeycreepers have the special characteristic that the history of their radiation is integrated with the geological history of the hawaiian islands. patterns in honeycreeper divergence appear to be linked to the pattern of island emergence  <cit> , which has been well-documented as part of a volcanic time series  <cit> . because this unusual geology provides a well-defined timeline, honeycreepers are a good system for estimation of rates of molecular evolution  <cit> .

unfortunately, of the  <dig> described historical honeycreeper species   <cit> , roughly two-thirds are now extinct, largely from human-related impacts such as habitat loss, introduced mammalian predators and vectored pathogens  <cit> . study of the evolution of disease resistance is an area that will especially benefit from genome-wide markers. in particular, honeycreepers appear extremely susceptible to introduced diseases such as avian malaria  and avian poxvirus, both vectored by an introduced culex mosquito . most extant honeycreepers are limited to higher elevations free from mosquitoes and disease  <cit> . however, a few species, most notably the hawaii amakihi , can survive with chronic malaria infection, exhibiting tolerance or resistance to the disease . a few studies suggest that strong selective pressure from malaria resulted in rapid evolution of disease tolerance in certain low-elevation hawaii amakihi populations and that resistance may be spreading amongst low-elevation amakihi, although it is unknown whether resistance arose once or simultaneously in multiple source populations  <cit> . understanding the source and mechanism of disease resistance in amakihi is a priority research area using the snp markers. such work is needed to improve our strategies for identifying and preserving the most viable populations of many species threatened by invasive pathogens.

our objective in this study is to characterize the genome of a hawaiian honeycreeper, the hawaii amakihi , and to develop and assess a set of genome-wide snp markers to enable both phylogenetics-scale and fine-scale investigations about adaptive evolution and population genetics. we used two sequencing-by-synthesis approaches and then performed a hybrid assembly to create a draft hawaii amakihi genome sequence. the hawaii amakihi, in addition to being a member of the honeycreeper adaptive radiation, serves as an ecological model for disease transmission due to its variable responses to infection by avian malaria  <cit> . the individual selected for the genome sequence had a high level of infection, but had been recaptured several times, indicating persistence despite a chronic, intense malaria infection. to increase the utility of markers for broader topics of study, we combined de-novo genome sequencing with a reduced representation sequencing method  to identify and map snp polymorphisms isolated from four additional honeycreeper species. in addition to facilitating research into honeycreeper evolution and disease resistance, the draft amakihi genome will contribute to knowledge of avian genome biology and improve the pool of resources for comparative genomic study.

RESULTS
genome assembly
our hybrid approach utilized both roche/ <dig> and illumina technology . illumina sequencing of the amakihi genome generated approximately 31 gb of data composed of over  <dig> million read pairs  and represented an approximately 60-fold coverage of the genome. the  <dig> data comprised  <dig> – 3x coverage, with 458 bp average read length. this is a substantially larger dataset than for the first avian genome, chicken, which was done using  <dig> million sanger reads with  <dig> - fold coverage  <cit> .table  <dig> 
summary of input for genome assembly




the hybrid assembly used the full 2x  <dig> coverage and ~19x illumina coverage , similar to the process for turkey which used ~5x  <dig> and ~25x illumina gaii  <cit> . we used only a portion of the total illumina data to avoid overwhelming the information from the  <dig> reads; limiting the data volume was also necessary to stay within the memory limits of the computer used . contigs were ordered and oriented and extended into scaffolds by aligning to the zebra finch genome sequence. in this way, amakihi genotypes at each zebra finch genomic position were determined. genotype calls were generated using only high-quality  bases in the mapped reads. an mpg  <cit>  score cutoff of ≥  <dig> is expected to yield high-quality genotypes with > <dig> % concordance with those from an illumina infinium genotyping assay  <cit> .

the structure of avian genomes in general appears to be relatively undisturbed with regard to rearrangements, resulting in high degree of synteny among a variety of bird species  <cit> . this property has been observed when comparing turkey  <cit>  and ficedula flycatcher to chicken  <cit> . our use of zebra finch as a template for aligning and assembling the amakihi genome is justified, in part, by the relatively recent divergence  of the species  <cit> . in fact, the ficedula albicollis genome shows remarkably strong synteny with chicken despite perhaps  <dig> million years of evolutionary distance  <cit> . however, on a more localized scale, ficedula flycatchers show many small rearrangements with respect to zebra finch  <cit> . if similar rearrangements have occurred between zebra finch and amakihi, then our assembly could be different from the true amakihi genome sequence.

the n <dig> value of contigs from the hybrid assembly was 23 kb, and 50 kb for scaffolds. this value is smaller than for other recently published bird genomes; for example, darwin’s finch had a 382 kb scaffold n <dig>  <cit> , and the value for flycatcher was  <dig>  mb  <cit> . additional sequencing libraries of larger insert sizes would perhaps have resulted in larger n <dig> values; however, this was effectively accomplished by ordering the contigs relative to the zebra finch genome. total assembly size of the amakihi genome was approximately  <dig> gb, similar in size to other bird genome assemblies  for darwin’s medium ground finch  <cit> ). we believe that our amakihi genome is relatively complete because the assembly size is similar to other bird genomes. we further tested this assumption by aligning zebra finch sequences to selected portions of the honeycreeper assembly and determining the percentage that successfully aligned. overall for the numbered chromosomes ,  <dig> % of zebra finch sites could be aligned .from this alignment we also calculated the genetic distance between amakihi and zebra finch as  <dig>  . it is possible that this value is underestimated since regions greatly diverged between amakihi and zebra finch may not have successfully mapped to the zebra finch reference.table  <dig>

a total of  <dig>  gb of the amakihi assembly was localized to  <dig> chromosomes by aligning contigs and scaffolds to zebra finch chromosomal sequences. although previously assembled avian genomes have taken advantage of linkage maps from the same species for chromosome assignment , alignment to other genomes has also been used. for ficedula albicollis, 73% of the genome sequence was assigned to chromosomes using the flycatcher linkage map; by comparing conserved organization with zebra finch, a total of 89% could be assigned  <cit> . as was the case for turkey  <cit>  and chicken  <cit> , most of the honeycreeper chromosomes are microchromosomes that cannot always be distinguished by size alone . the draft amakihi genome sequence is available in fasta format in the ncbi repository, bioproject: prjna252695figure  <dig>

after assembly, a larger number of illumina reads were aligned back to the assembled genome to a depth of ~ <dig> x for the autosomes and ~25x for the z chromosome to identify and call snps. nucleotide diversity  on the autosomes ranged from  <dig>  on chromosome lge22_random to  <dig>  on chromosome lg <dig> .table  <dig> 
nucleotide diversity by chromosome




because in birds females are the heterogametic sex  chromosome z should in theory have no heterozygous sites except in pseudo autosomal regions. our data show about  <dig> % of the total sequence sites assigned to z and z random are heterozygous  versus  <dig> % for sites on autosomal chromosomes. these false positives on the z could be attributed to mismapping of paralagous reads or misassignment of autosomal segments to the z and z random chromosomes. the false positive rate on z/z random is an approximate indicator of the false positive rate elsewhere in the genome because mismapping of paralagous sites could have occurred for autosomal chromosomes as well.

approximately  <dig>  million snp sites were discovered in the assembled amakihi genome, or approximately one snp every 256 bp. this is similar to results for the flycatcher, where  <dig>  million snps  were identified in one individual  <cit> . heterozygosity was characterized for each chromosome by counting the number of heterozygous sites in 100 kb bins along each chromosome . large stretches of extremely low variability  were observed on five chromosomes . coverage for these regions was not different than for other sites in the genome. they ranged in size from 2 mb on chromosome  <dig> to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> and together made up  <dig> % of the genome sequence . large stretches of low heterozygosity were also observed on turkey chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and were interpreted as ibd  haplotypes  <cit> . the turkeys described in that study were from domestic lines that had been subjected to many generations of artificial selection, so finding ibd regions was not unexpected. in the case of the amakihi, which has a relatively large population size, inbreeding is not expected. for inbreeding between first order relatives  approximately 25% of the genome would be expected to show large homozygous stretches, while inbreeding of second order relatives  would result in about  <dig> %. to differentiate between the effects of inbreeding and selection, we would need to determine the probability of snp loci in the low heterozygosity regions being ibd or identical by state . as we obtain more data from other amakihi, we will be able to calculate allele frequencies for the loci in question and be able to calculate ibd/ibs probability for the low heterozygosity regions. these regions could possibly represent signatures of selective sweeps in the evolutionary history of the amakihi, or be the result of inbreeding, although the latter may be less likely given the relatively high variation found in amakihi from the same locality as 1771- <dig>  the individual whose genome is presented here. we compared gene classifications within each homozygous region to those on the rest of each respective chromosome using ensembl annotations for the zebra finch . no substantial difference was observed.figure  <dig>

rad data
the rad tag method involves digesting genomic dna with a restriction enzyme and sequencing fragments  of dna adjacent to restriction sites  <cit> . we sequenced rad tags for six individuals of four honeycreeper species in addition to the same amakihi for which we obtained the genome. this method yielded a wide range of sequences per individual, with an average of  <dig> , <dig> post quality filtering . we attribute the large range of number of reads to stochastic factors and variable sample dna quality, as all other parameters  were the same between samples. rad sequences were analyzed following two protocols: without a reference genome, using the stacks pipeline, or utilizing the amakihi sequence as a reference for assembly and genotype calling. raw reads for each individual in fastq format have been uploaded to ncbi  and will be available after publication of this article.

by using stacks to assemble and genotype rad sequences, we found  <dig>  loci with  <dig>  passing our filters,  <dig>  of which were variable loci containing at least one snp site within or between individuals . there were, on average,  <dig>  loci per species passing our filters  and  <dig>  snps per species ; i.e., about 10% of loci contained snp. only  <dig> stacks with  <dig> total snps were shared by at least three of the honeycreeper species.table  <dig> 
stacks results after quality filtering




since we had both rad and genome data for the same individual amakihi, we compared genotype calls from stacks to known values from the genome sequence. with a minimum stack depth requirement of nine, only  <dig> % of stacks snp calls differed from the genome value.

rads with a reference
we also analyzed rad data with the benefit of the amakihi reference sequence. restriction cut sites, and therefore rad sequences, are expected to be randomly, not evenly, distributed across the genome  <cit> . when aligning honeycreeper rad sequences to the amakihi genome, we observed a denser distribution of rads on the microchromosomes . we found the same pattern of non-random distribution of restriction sites based on an in silico restriction digest of the amakihi genome . one possible explanation for this is that the microchromosomes of avian species are commonly more gene-dense than the macrochromosomes, with a higher gc content , and restriction enzymes tend to have a high proportion of gc content in their binding site  <cit> . the enzyme used in this study, bsexi, contains 80% gc in its 5 bp recognition site, making this a plausible explanation. alternatively, there may be more repetitive dna sequences in macrochromosomes, and the repetitive sequences might not contain the bsexi recognition site. being able to align rads to a reference provides an advantage for researchers who may wish to select a smaller number of rad snp sites for genotyping, as the spacing and location of specific markers makes it easier to narrow down to only the necessary ones.figure  <dig>

we used the burrows-wheeler aligner  and the genome analysis toolkit  in conjunction with the amakihi reference sequence to identify inter- and intraspecific snps using the rad sequences. using this method, we identified  <dig>  snp sites with  <dig>  passing quality filters . after filtering, there were, on average,  <dig>  sites with a known genotype identified per sample  including an average of  <dig>  heterozygous sites per sample .  <dig>  non-reference sites were shared by at least four samples.table  <dig>

compared to analyzing without a reference, the bwa-gatk pipeline resulted in more snps identified for nihoa finch, fewer for iiwi, about the same for palila, and fewer for amakihi.

interspecies comparisons
we performed a phylogenetic analysis to demonstrate the utility of rad sequences for determining relationships amongst taxa. pyrad  <cit>  was used to identify and homologize rad sequences with 10x or higher coverage present in three or more taxa, which produced  <dig>  bp. a maximum likelihood analysis was performed on these data in garli  <cit>  with  <dig>  bootstrap replicates and the relationships of the five species are shown . this analysis recovered the expected topology with good support for the iiwi/apapane relationship. support for the palila/nihoa finch node was low, perhaps as a result of the deeper divergence between these species than between iiwi and apapane, and the shorter internode between this clade and the amakihi clade  <cit> .figure  <dig>

applications of honeycreeper genomic resources
herein, we describe a draft genome sequence for the hawaii amakihi and associated genomic resources for hawaiian honeycreepers including approximately  <dig>  million snps within the amakihi genome and over  <dig>  snps within and between amakihi and four other honeycreeper species. honeycreepers are an important model system for many questions in evolutionary biology, and the snp markers will facilitate a wide range of future studies in ongoing and new research areas. being genome-enabled both enhances the resolution of current research methods  and also opens up new analyses that weren’t possible before . some of the important questions which may be addressed include: how do rates of sequence evolution vary among different classes of dna; what genes or genome regions are involved in speciation, adaptation or evolution of tolerance or resistance to disease; and how much adaptive potential exists in a population after demographic decline or fragmentation?

studies of the evolutionary relationships of honeycreepers  have been limited by available technology and methods, as well as by rapid speciation and low levels of sequence divergence. early molecular studies used allozyme electrophoresis  <cit> , restriction fragment length polymorphism of mitochondrial dna  <cit> , and relatively short dna sequences  <cit>  to only marginally resolve nucleotide substitution rates and relationships within the honeycreepers. larger molecular datasets, such as one with entire mitochondrial genomes and  <dig> nuclear loci  more adequately resolved the phylogeny, and estimated rates of sequence evolution and a split from a cardueline finch lineage at  <dig>  mya  <cit> . re-evaluating the honeycreeper phylogeny with a larger, more comprehensive dataset will allow researchers to investigate the pattern and tempo of evolution in this radiation. with genome-wide markers, it will be possible to connect genomic regions with specific adaptive traits across the phylogeny. because precise geological information about the hawaiian islands provides a framework for dating evolutionary events, the honeycreeper radiation can provide unique insights into the evolutionary process. what is learned from honeycreepers can also be compared with other avian adaptive radiations such as darwin’s finches  <cit>  to further our understanding of the evolutionary process overall.

the ability to use analytical tools that connect genotypes to traits, such as gwas  <cit> ) is a key benefit of the honeycreeper genomic marker set. these methods require large numbers of markers and were previously only useful for genome-enabled model organisms. such techniques may allow identification of genes or regions implicated in disease resistance or specific adaptive traits; when such information is combined with results in other taxa, it contributes to our overall understanding of molecular mechanisms. this is also a first step towards investigating what happens to the genetic diversity in adaptively important genes or regions when species decline and become endangered. identifying key genomic regions for disease resistance or adaptation could help focus conservation efforts towards preserving genetic variation in those areas and provide guidance for genetically-based population management decisions.

hawaiian honeycreepers are also a model to investigate the response of genetic variation to human caused population decline, fragmentation and founder effects. for example, the hawaii akepa  occupies < 10% of its historical range in fragmented habitat and is a magnitude less populous than before its decline, yet contemporary samples show the same level of mitochondrial genetic diversity as in specimens sampled > 100 years ago and no significant differentiation between fragmented populations is detected  <cit> . in another case, several founder populations of laysan finch  have been established on pearl & hermes reef and microsatellite data reveal that these have become genetically differentiated from the laysan population and, to some extent, from each other  <cit> . finally, hawaii amakihi, which have a relatively large population size, exhibit a rather unique elevational structuring, with populations from high elevation genetically differentiated from those at low elevation; data from museum skins suggest that this was also true historically. this elevational pattern is not found in contemporary iiwi  or apapane  populations  <cit> . using the more comprehensive snp marker set will provide the power to start looking at selection and adaptation to anthropogenic caused change in these species.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a set of genomic resources for hawaiian honeycreepers that will facilitate research on disease interactions, metapopulation dynamics, adaptive radiations, and genome evolution. the amakihi genome sequence will enable comparative studies of avian genomes and is an important contribution as it represents one of the more than  <dig>  passeriform species, a group for which there are currently only three other genomes available in the literature  <cit> . the results yield a large number of genome wide markers, both from heterozygous sites in the sequenced individual and discovered using rad tags with other honeycreeper species. we have demonstrated their potential phylogenetic utility based on a tree of relationships between honeycreeper species used in our rad analysis that matches expectation based on previous molecular phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . heterozygosity measures for the individual sequenced, a malaria-resistant amakihi, indicate some regions of potential selective sweeps that could be of interest for study of malaria resistance. these regions are being targeted for resequencing in populations of malaria resistant and susceptible amakihi. the markers could also be used to identify regions of divergence among honeycreeper species to help elucidate the speciation process  <cit> .
