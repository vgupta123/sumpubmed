BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  are ancient molecules that act as vital sensors of environmental and internal physiological signals in organisms. this family of proteins which forms the largest class of cell surface receptors found in animal genomes  <cit> , has an early evolutionary origin  <cit> , and serves a wide variety of functions including reproduction. structurally, all known gpcrs share a common architecture of seven membrane-spanning helices connected by intra- and extracellular loops.

c. elegans is a simple, highly reproductive, multicellular model organism appropriate to the investigation of innumerable signaling pathways at the organismal level. despite our knowledge of the reproductive physiology of c. elegans, the molecular endocrinology regulating reproduction in c. elegans is unknown. the c. elegans genome is known to code for at least  <dig> gpcrs  <cit>  but the gpcr critical to the regulation of reproduction in this nematode are not yet known. the characterization of membrane receptors related to the regulation of reproduction within this model nematode organism is very important for both the study of evolutionary biology as well as the study of the molecular endocrinology of reproduction in multicellular organisms.

in mammals, reproduction is controlled by hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis and hostile environmental conditions are known to suppress hpg axis hormones, thereby decreasing or preventing reproduction  <cit> . the hypothalamus acts as a sensor of the environment to regulate the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone . gnrh <dig> released from hypothalamic neurons into the hypophyseal bloodstream binds to gnrh receptors  on gonadotropes of the anterior pituitary signaling for the synthesis and secretion of gonadotropins. gonadotropins in turn bind to receptors on the gonads leading to the production of the sex steroids  <cit> . the presence of a complex endocrine axis that regulates reproduction in c. elegans has not been contemplated, since central components of this axis – gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor  and its ligand – have not been reported.

in this study we demonstrate that c. elegans contains a gnrhr  orthologous to gnrhr <dig> in humans and to the adipokinetic hormone receptors  of insects, and that ce-gnrhr specifically localizes to the nuclei of germline and intestinal cells, and to the myofilament lattice of the pharyngeal musculature. our results support the presence of an evolutionarily conserved gpcr possibly involved in reproduction and metabolism in c. elegans.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
sequence similarity searches using the sequences of the principal gpcr signaling components of the human hpg axis were performed against the c. elegans genome. this analysis indicated the presence of two proteins, one of  <dig> amino acids  and another of  <dig> amino acids  sharing  <dig> % and  <dig> % nucleotide similarity to that of human gnrhr <dig> and gnrhr <dig>  respectively . in addition, a leucine-rich gpcr previously reported in c. elegans  has  <dig> % nucleotide similarity to human follicle stimulating hormone receptor   <cit> . this paper is primarily focused on the  <dig> amino acid protein  orthologous to human gnrhr <dig>  amino acid sequence alignment of human gnrhr <dig> with the c. elegans orthologue  and  <dig> other class a gpcrs demonstrated considerable sequence similarity . like its human orthologue,  <dig> separate prediction algorithms used to analyze the structure of ce-gnrhr predicted a gpcr belonging to the rhodopsin family . these prediction programs indicate that ce-gnrhr contains several structural motifs similar to that of human gnrhr <dig>  including  <dig> transmembrane domains,  <dig> intracellular and extracellular loops, and amino acid residues representing pkc phosphorylation sites and g-protein coupling sites . as has been reported for all non-human gnrhr1s  <cit> , the ce-gnrhr has a long c-terminal tail  characteristic of a gene ancestral to gnrh and akh receptors. although the overall amino acid sequence identity between c. elegans and human gnrhr <dig> was only ~21%, closer analysis revealed that 56% of the functionally important amino acid residues  of human gnrhr <dig> were conserved in ce-gnrhr . the highest degree of conservation was observed in those amino acids involved in receptor activation , and gq <dig> coupling . lesser conservation was observed in amino acids important to binding pocket formation , gs coupling , and pkc phosphorylation . ligand binding sites were least conserved , indicating the possibility that the ligand of ce-gnrhr is significantly different from that of human gnrhr <dig>  indeed, in drosophila melanogaster, a cloned gnrhr  <cit>  was subsequently identified as akhr from ligand binding studies indicating akh was the binding partner of this receptor in insects  <cit> . in this connection, ce-gnrhr had the highest overall sequence similarity  and the highest fir similarity  with drosophila melanogaster akhr , a receptor involved in metabolism . in comparison, there was less conservation of overall sequence and firs in two other human class a gpcrs, rhodopsin  and vasopressin receptor type 1a  when compared with c. elegans . this comparative analysis suggests ce-gnrhr is orthologous to insect akhr and human gnrhr. the relatively greater conservation of firs observed between ce-gnrhr, dm-akhr and human gnrhr <dig> , suggests these proteins are all derived from a single ancestral gpcr, and, are thus orthologous to each other.

the percent nucleotide and amino acid identity of c. elegans orthologues was determined using align. % identity is derived from the align pairwise alignment. mass is calculated from the amino acid sequence. *identification of the fsh receptor orthologue as reported in  <cit> ; percent identities for this receptor were derived from the total alignment of the orthologue and human fshr.

shown are the amino acid similarities between the functionally important residues of ce-gnrhr and human gnrhr <dig>  drosophila melanogaster akhr , human rhodopsin, and human vasopressin type 1a. also shown are the overall amino acid identity/similarity for each comparison. 'similarity' of compared amino acids was based on the blosum <dig> matrix, a more conservative measure of similarity than that used in the align algorithm, and percentages were calculated as described in methods.

despite the orthology of these sequences, the genomic organization of ce-gnrhr, human gnrhr <dig>  and dm-akhr are radically different . the coding region of each gene contains a different number of exons:  <dig> in ce-gnrhr,  <dig> in dm-akhr, and  <dig> in human gnrhr <dig>  intronic sequence length is also variable. while the  <dig> introns of human gnrhr <dig> total more than  <dig> kilobases, the  <dig> introns of dm-akhr only amount to ~ <dig> kilobase. additionally, sequence corresponding to the 3' end of ce-gnrhr exon  <dig> and all of ce-gnrhr exon  <dig> is absent from human gnrhr. in order to deduce the genomic organization of a gene ancestral to all three of these gnrhr genes, a considerably larger number of genes would have to be analyzed. yet, at least one coincidental feature of the gene maps shown in fig. 2b might be indicative of ancestral gene structure: exon  <dig> of human gnrhr and exon  <dig> of dm-akhr terminate at the same point.

identification and immunolocalization of ce-gnrhr
to determine whether ce-gnrhr was transcribed in the worm, we isolated rna, and, using two gene-specific primers, amplified the region depicted in fig. 2b. the expected  <dig> bp cdna fragment encompassing exons  <dig> through  <dig> was detected . the sequence of the amplified cdna , matched the genomic sequence , minus intronic sequence, demonstrating that the amplified cdna was amplified from ce-gnrhr mrna template. this confirms that ce-gnrhr is actively transcribed in adult c. elegans.

to determine whether ce-gnrhr protein was expressed in c. elegans, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the c-terminus  of ce-gnrhr and the nematode homogenate was subjected to immunoblot analyses. the affinity purified anti-ce-gnrhr antibody recognized a 46-kda band , the calculated molecular weight of ce-gnrhr, as well as higher molecular weight  variants that might represent mature or otherwise post-translationally modified species and lower molecular weight  variants that might represent truncated protein products, as we have reported for human gnrhr <dig>  <cit> . despite limited similarity between the n-terminus of the human and c. elegans receptor, a monoclonal antibody raised against the n-terminus of human gnrhr <dig> identifies a single band of 46-kda in the c. elegans homogenate  and produces similar immunolocalization ; however, it remains unclear whether this antibody is detecting ce-gnrhr. the specificity of the polyclonal antibody against ce-gnrhr for ce-gnrhr compared to the putative orthologue to human gnrhr <dig>   is indicated by the fact that the antibody does not recognize a band at  <dig> -kda, the molecular weight of the immature form of orthologue  <dig> . additionally, comparison of the amino acid sequences and genomic organization of ce-gnrhr and orthologue  <dig> revealed limited similarity between the two genes, especially at the c-terminus of ce-gnrhr – against which the anti-ce-gnrhr antibody was raised .

to examine the localization of ce-gnrhr, eggs were immunostained with the monoclonal antibody against human gnrhr <dig>  or the anti-ce-gnrhr antibody . both the n-terminus  and c-terminus  antibodies immunolabeled the same structures , indicating that ce-gnrhr is expressed in eggs. with both antibodies, intense staining was observed within the egg, but not the cuticle . staining was not apparent in eggs treated with secondary antibody alone. the authenticity of the anti-human gnrhr <dig> antibody was verified by positive staining of gonadotropes in sections of human pituitary .

to better localize cellular staining in worms, we permeabilized worms and performed whole-mount fluorescent immunohistochemistry. these experiments indicated that ce-gnrhr was localized to the nucleus of maturing oocytes and intestinal cells , to sperm, pharyngeal muscles , but not other cells such as hypodermal cells. similar staining of these structures was evident for both the anti-human-gnrhr <dig> and anti-ce-gnrhr antibodies. ce-gnrhr staining clearly illustrates an increase in the size of the oocyte nuclei as they mature along the gonadal arm . upon fertilization, ce-gnrhr staining becomes diffuse throughout the developing egg, although staining appears to increase during egg development . only uniform background autofluorescence was apparent in worms treated with secondary antibody alone .

interestingly, ce-gnrhr also was detected along the myofilament lattice of the pharyngeal muscles as evidenced by 1). staining along the three parallel muscles that comprise the pharyngeal musculature beginning at the tip of the head and extending to the pharyngeal bulb , 2). staining of all  <dig> pharyngeal muscle  domains, but not in the gaps between contractile zones of adjacent pharyngeal muscle domains , and 3). staining of myofilaments that run radially towards the lumen and which are most obvious in the bulbs . in fig. 5ii taken at a higher focal plain, only one muscle lattice is observed . these results indicate ce-gnrhr is present on the pharyngeal musculature.

the specificity of binding of anti-ce-gnrhr antibody to gnrhr was demonstrated by the lack of staining throughout the worm  when the antibody was preincubated with its antigen .

to confirm the nuclear localization of ce-gnrhr, we stained c. elegans with ce-gnrhr antibody and a nuclear stain  and superimposed the images. there was a clear overlap between ce-gnrhr immunoreactivity and the nuclear stain in both oocytes and intestinal cell nuclei , demonstrating that ce-gnrhr was localized to the nuclear membrane of oocytes and intestinal cells. at higher magnification, separate chromosomes are evident with the hoechst stain  while ce-gnrhr staining is uniform , suggesting that ce-gnrhr stains the membrane rather than intranuclear structures. this was again demonstrated by the scattered color of the superimposed image . in summary, these results indicate that ce-gnrhr is present on the nuclear membrane of oocytes and intestinal cells. further, these results corroborate earlier reports of gnrhr <dig> localization to the nucleus of proliferating cells  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
maximum parsimony analysis of the class a and b gpcr dataset  yielded  <dig> most parsimonious trees, the strict consensus of which resulted in the collapse of only  <dig> nodes . relatively robust support  was found for a group comprising all  <dig> vertebrate gnrhr types, and, though not achieving strong bootstrap support, all most parsimonious trees contained a group comprising tunicate gnrhr , insect corazonin receptors, and all vertebrate gnrhrs. recovered in all of the most parsimonious trees, a monophyletic group of akhrs was hypothesized as the sister group to the group ce-gnrhr + c. briggsae-gnrhr. together with the molluscan gnrhr , these receptors were hypothesized to be the sister group to the group of corazonin receptors + chordate gnrhrs discussed above. the group of all gnrhrs and gnrhr-like receptors was recovered more often than not , to the exclusion of other class a gpcrs included in the analysis.

discussion
our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of a gpcr in the nematode c. elegans with homology to human gnrhr <dig> and akhrs of insects . the nematode gpcr superfamily consists of  <dig> rhodopsin-like receptors,  <dig> seven-tm chemoreceptors, and other similar proteins, and represents the largest gene family accounting for more than 5% of the entire c. elegans genome  <cit> . evidence that this gpcr  is orthologous to the human gnrhr <dig> and dm-akhr is supported by the findings that, 1) the next closest potential orthologue to human gnrhr <dig>  has considerably less identity  to human gnrhr <dig> than f54d <dig>  . likewise, the next closest potential orthologue to dm-akhr  has less identity  to dm-akhr than f54d <dig>  ; 2) the alignment of f54d <dig>  with human gnrhr <dig> and two other class a gpcrs, rhodopsin and vasopressin receptor type 1a, showed that the functionally important amino acids of f54d <dig>  were significantly more similar to the same sites in human gnrhr . likewise, the alignment of f54d <dig>  with dm-gnrhr also indicated significant similarity between the functionally important amino acids , and 3) this gpcr was actively transcribed in the adult worm  and its translated protein was localized to the germline, fertilized eggs, intestine, and pharynx . likewise, in drosophila melanogaster akhr was most highly expressed in ovaries, digestive system, brain, tracheae and fat body cells, although immunoreactivity appeared to be more cytoplasmic in nature  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis supports the idea that the evolutionary relationships of ce-gnrhr place it somewhere between the vertebrate gnrhrs and insect akhrs, though it is more closely allied with akhrs . the strict consensus tree of select class a and b gpcrs  provides minimal bootstrap support for many of the deeper nodes, but three conservative conclusions relevant to our study of ce-gnrhr may be drawn from the phylogenetic analysis:  ce-gnrhr is more closely related to insect akhrs than to chordate gnrhrs or corazonin receptors,  vertebrate gnrhrs comprise a distinct group of receptors, separate from all other gnrhr-like receptors, including ce-gnrhr, and,  the classification of ce-gnrhr  as a gnrhr-like receptor  is supported.

the ce-gnrhr ligand has not been identified. intriguingly, though, we have shown that human gnrh increases both egg laying  and viable offspring  in c. elegans , although it is unclear at this stage whether human gnrh <dig> binds ce-gnrhr. gnrhr and gnrh/gnrh-like oligopeptides have been identified in all mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrate species  <cit>  studied to date, as well as other vertebrates and invertebrates   <cit> . while a variety of invertebrate species, including numerous insects and the oyster, crassotrea gigas, have been shown to possess gnrhr orthologues, insects bind a distinct, non-gnrh-like peptide   <cit> . in insects, akhs are secreted from endocrine cells of the corpora cardiaca into the hemolymph  <cit>  and mobilize energy reserve from storages  and regulate energy homeostasis  <cit>  by signaling through akhrs.

molecular phylogenetic analyses of the past decade have garnered increasingly strong support for the group ecdysozoa  <cit> , the major phyla of which are arthropoda and nematoda. under this phylogenetic hypothesis, it is not unreasonable to expect a nematode gnrhr will bind an akh-like peptide. yet, an invertebrate gnrh peptide has been biochemically characterized in the mollusk octopus vulgaris. given the placement of ce-gnrhr in the topology of our phylogenetic hypothesis – between the akhrs and the molluscan gnrhr , whose ligand is unknown, but may very well be gnrh – another possibility is that ce-gnrhr is a receptor capable of binding akh- and gnrh-like ligands. a final, equally plausible possibility is that ce-gnrhr binds an altogether different hormone specific to nematodes, which is supported by the relatively low conservation of ligand binding amino acid residues for both human gnrhr and dm-akhr .

ce-gnrhr localized to the nucleus of germline and intestinal cells, as well as to the myofilamant lattice of the pharyngeal musculature . although gnrhr <dig> is traditionally thought of as a plasma membrane receptor  <cit> , it is becoming increasingly evident that gnrhr <dig> can be internalized from the plasma membrane to the nucleus  <cit> . indeed, the nuclear localization of gnrhr <dig> has been reported in rapidly proliferating cells such as pancreatic and breast cancer cells  <cit> . ligand binding to gnrhr may be the stimulus for the nuclear internalization of the receptor since gnrh has been shown to be rapidly internalized to the nuclear membrane prior to entry into the nucleus  <cit> . although we did not detect intense ce-gnrhr staining in germline and intestinal plasma membranes , it remains to be determined whether ce-gnrhr localized to the nucleus  is from de novo receptor synthesized in the cytosol or from ce-gnrhr translocalization from the plasma membrane. nevertheless, the localization of ce-gnrhr to the nucleus provides an exceptional molecular marker of nuclear growth as germ cells progress through the gonadal arm prior to fertilization .

in vertebrates, gnrh neurons originate from the olfactory placode during organogenesis  <cit> . gnrh secretion from hypothalamic neurons is tightly influenced by environmental conditions  <cit> , and this environmental sensing mechanism regulates reproduction  <cit> . indeed, it has been demonstrated that gnrh <dig> increases the excitability of olfactory receptor neurons, that the terminal nerve functions to modulate the odorant sensitivity of olfactory receptor neurons and that this signaling is tightly linked to reproduction  <cit> . the localization of ce-gnrhr to the germline, pharynx, and intestine  is suggestive of a role in modulating reproductive function in accordance with environmental conditions. like the human, the nematode also regulates reproduction dependent upon environmental signals  <cit>  and it is well demonstrated that reproduction in c. elegans is strictly controlled by environmental cues such as food and temperature. under adverse conditions , c. elegans can enter a reproductively inactive alternative third larval stage called dauer  <cit> . the decision to enter the developmentally arrested dauer larval stage is triggered by a combination of signals from sensory neurons in response to environmental cues  <cit> . although signaling between olfactory neurons and the reproductive system has been demonstrated in c. elegans  <cit> , it is unclear what signaling pathways are involved. it does however suggest the presence of an endocrine system that regulates reproduction in response to environmental conditions.

we propose a model whereby a putative signaling peptide  in c. elegans may be released into the body of the worm from neurons in the head during favorable conditions, where it can then act to signal through ce-gnrhr located on the pharyngeal musculature, intestine and germ cells . in this way, this peptide signaling can simultaneously initiate both pharyngeal pumping and reproduction when food is plentiful. interestingly, the dauer-inducing pheromone detected by sensory neurons in c. elegans signals by a complex pathway to the germline, pharynx, intestine, and the ectoderm  <cit> . indeed, it has recently been shown that octopus gnrh  has a contractile effect on the radula retractor muscle which expresses oct-gnrhr  <cit> , and that oct-gnrh mrna-expressing cell bodies and immunoreactive fibers are present on the superior buccal lobe suggesting that oct-gnrh is involved in feeding behavior generated by contractions of the muscle of the buccal mass  <cit> . the coupling of food intake to reproduction by such a mechanism would allow for the rapid development and subsequent reproduction of the worm. it is intriguing that ce-gnrhr is closely related evolutionary with human gnrhr and insect akhr, involved in regulating reproduction and metabolism, respectively. ce-gnrhr may provide a molecular link between reproduction and metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
the sequence similarity, structural organization and localization of ce-gnrhr provide evidence of an evolutionarily conserved gnrhr orthologue in c. elegans. coupled with the presence of a leucine-rich gpcr  in c. elegans with sequence similarity to vertebrate gonadotropin receptors  <cit>  and the detection of estrogen binding proteins in c. elegans  <cit> , these results suggest the existence of an ancestral endocrine system for the regulation of reproduction in c. elegans. whilst our studies are suggestive of a role of ce-gnrhr in reproduction in c. elegans, further studies are required to elucidate the signaling pathways and functional role of this gpcr. identification of the ce-gnrhr ligand will provide important insights into evolutionary biology, invertebrate systematics, and the reproductive neuroendocrinology of nematodes. regardless, our identification of an evolutionarily conserved gnrhr in c. elegans opens the way to using this organism as a model system to study reproductive endocrinology.
