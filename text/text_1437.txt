BACKGROUND
fundamental building blocks of signal transduction networks are the kinases and phosphatases. the kinases phosphorylate and the phosphatases dephosphorylate their substrates. dynamics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during signal propagation determines the duration, intensity and amplitude of a processed signal
 <cit> . one such signal processing module is the mitogen activated protein kinases  cascade, which is involved in growth, differentiation, proliferation, morphogenesis, inflammation etc.
 <cit> . external signals with unique characteristics thus utilize the cascade to transmit their respective encoded message to the nucleus. the mapk cascade comprises of three kinases – mapkkk , mapkk  and mapk 
 <cit> . a receptor mediated incoming signal first triggers phosphorylation of mkkk
 <cit> . the singly phosphorylated mkkk  phosphorylates mkk to mkk-p  and subsequently to mkk-pp , in a sequential manner
 <cit> . the mkk-pp relays the signal to mk in two steps and doubly phosphorylated mk-pp is the output of cascade
 <cit>  that passes on to the nucleus to activate various transcription factors
 <cit> . simultaneous to the phosphorylation of these kinases, phosphatases present in the cellular volume carry out the process of dephosphorylation that primarily aims to stop the phosphorylation mediated signal flow
 <cit> .

like most of the cellular systems
 <cit> , mapk cascades are also observed to robustly maintain their functions while subjected to perturbations
 <cit> . in the cascade, the interactions amongst the kinases during signal processing are tightly conserved from yeast to mammal
 <cit> , but phosphatases of the system exhibits diverse interactions with their target kinases
 <cit> . figure
 <dig> show various interaction topologies among the kinases and phosphatases of a three layer mapk cascade represented here by m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  the kinases of the cascades are mkkk, mkk and mk and phos <dig>  phos <dig> and phos <dig> are the phosphatases of the system which were assumed to be constitutively present in cellular volume
 <cit> . all three kinases in a m <dig> type network have specific phosphatases phos <dig>  phos <dig> and phos <dig> for the dephosphorylation process
 <cit> . in a m <dig> type network, kinases mkkk and mkk are dephosphorylated by phos <dig> and mk is dephosphorylated by phos2
 <cit> . the architecture of system like m <dig> is such that mkkk gets dephopshorylated by phos <dig>  whereas phos <dig> dephosphorylates both mkk and mk
 <cit> . finally the mapk cascade exhibiting more complex design of interaction such as m <dig> is such that mkkk and mkk are dephosphorylated by phos <dig> whereas mkk and mk are dephosphorylated by phos2
 <cit> . although these topologically distinct interactions among the kinases and their phosphatases are experimentally well characterized, how these interactions uniquely shape the robustness of the cascade output remains to be understood. additionally, as the cellular concentrations of the phosphatases and kinases are comparable
 <cit> , it is plausible that the kinases can sequester their respective phosphatases by binding to them, making the sequestrated complex functionally inaccessible to the rest of the system
 <cit> . as the systems m1-m <dig> demonstrate different architectures of kinase-phosphatase interactions, sequestration of phosphatases in each system could modulate the output uniquely. here we examined how various designs of kinases-phosphatases interactions determine the robustness of individual system types to external perturbations and additionally how phosphatases’ sequestration contributes to the robustness profile of the system. 

based on the literature of kinase-phosphatase interactions, we developed four types of mathematical models of the mapk cascade, and calculated the robustness of the cascade output for each model type, considering both michaelismenten type kinetics  and elementary mass action kinetics  to capture the signal flow. our simulations uncovered an implicit/hidden system level negative feedback loop in the system type m <dig>  from the phosphatase phos <dig>  to the top layer kinase mkkk . due to the implicit negative feedback loop, enhancement/reduction in the concentration of phos <dig> reciprocally modulated the amplitude of phosphorylated mkkk. further analysis suggested that strength of the negative feedback loop is a function of the sequestration strength. strong phosphatase sequestration can completely abolish the effect of the feedback loop, which we show for both k <dig> and k <dig> models. also we found that irrespective of the kinase-phosphatase interaction topologies, output robustness of all models dramatically increased in the phosphatase sequestrated conditions as compared to their unsequestrated counterparts, which unravel a plausible cellular strategy to maintain robust signal response behaviour in randomly perturbed systems.

methods
model building
as mentioned earlier, in the model type k <dig> the different interaction designs of the systems m1-m <dig> were built assuming steady state in the various enzyme-substrate complexes
 <cit> , that are formed during the signal propagation. in the model type k <dig>  no assumptions were made while capturing the dynamics of the systems m1-m4
 <cit> . transcriptionally induced phosphatases such as mkp1
 <cit>  were not considered in the study as the main focus of the study was to explore the regulatory properties emerging from interactions that are purely biochemical in nature. in the models, an incoming signal phosphorylates mkkk to mkkk-p. mkkk-p phosphorylates mkk to mkk-p and subsequently mkk-p to mkk-pp. in a similar fashion mkk-pp activates mk by double phosphorylation. here mkk and mkk-p compete for their common enzyme mkkk-p, so does the mk and mk-p for their common enzyme mkk-pp, respectively. phosphatase phos <dig> dephosphorylates the singly phosphorylated mkkk-p back to the inactive form mkkk. in the mkk and mk layer both singly and doubly phosphorylated kinases compete for their phosphatases. among the four systems, only m <dig> has three phosphatases specific to each layer of the mapk cascade and rest of the systems  have only two phosphatases. the models built with k <dig> involved derivation of flux equations for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation which captured the system specific flow of signal, derived separately based on the interaction designs of kinases and phosphatases for the four different system types. the models with k <dig> didn’t require derivation of the flux equations and the signal flow was determined from the interactions among the kinases and phosphatases. mathematical equations capturing the dynamics of the four systems built with k <dig> are shown below. derivation of the flux equations of the four models is elaborately given in the additional file
 <dig>  the models built with k <dig> are referred as mik <dig>  i = 1… <dig> and models built with k <dig> are referred as mik <dig>  i = 1… <dig> 

here we adopted two independent parameter sets from the literature for building k <dig> and k <dig> type models. we found that irrespective of the parametric differences in k <dig> and k <dig> type models, the mapk cascade’s robustness and signal response behaviour are pivotally shaped by the designs of interactions among its kinases and phosphatases. we also tested how the robustness and signal response behaviour of k <dig> models are affected when k <dig> assumes quasi steady state . we demonstrate that the robustness and signal response behaviour are largely preserved between the elementary mass action models  and their respective steady state counterparts . flux equations derived for k2_qss models are identical to the equations used in k <dig> models. for example, flux equations used in m2k <dig> are identical to that used in m2k2_qss. derivation of flux equations for the four different k <dig> type models is given below.

model m1k1
the system design was inspired from the quantitative studies by huang & ferrell on xenopus oocytes
 <cit>  and by hatakeyama et al. on the erbb- <dig> cells
 <cit>  where each of the layer of the three layers of the mapk cascade have individual phosphatases. m <dig> has three phosphatases phos <dig>  phos <dig> and phos <dig>  specific to the three layers of the mapk cascade. a set of coupled differential equations that capture the dynamics of the model is shown as

  dmkkk-pdt=sig.k <dig> mkkkk11+mkkkk1-phos <dig> k <dig> mkkkk21+mkkk-pk <dig>

  dmk-ppdt=k <dig> mkk-pp.mk-pk81+mkk7+mk-pk8-k <dig> phos <dig> mk-ppk91+mk-ppk9+mk-pk <dig> 

in the equations  – , ki is the catalytic rate of the ith reaction and ki is the km of the ith reaction. ‘sig’ in equation  represents the incoming signal that activates the cascade. derivation of the flux equations is given in the additional file
 <dig> 

amount of unphosphorylated kinases can be derived from the mass conservation relations

 mkkktotal=+mkktotal=++mktotal=++ 

thus at any time = ‘t’, the amount of mkkk/mkk/mk in the system could be calculated using the mass conservation relations.

model m2k1
the system design was taken from the work of bhalla and iyenger on nih- <dig> t mouse fibroblasts
 <cit> . equations for phosphorylation are identical to m1k <dig>  but the mkkk and mkk layer dephosphorylation was assumed to be carried out by a signal phosphatase phos <dig>  mk layer dephosphorylation was carried out by the phosphatase phos <dig>  under such condition, flux equation for dephosphorylation is modified in the equations ,  and  above.

equations
 <cit>  are thus modified to

model m3k1
the model design m <dig> partially resembles the b cell signal mapk cascade
 <cit> . here, dephosphorylation of mkkk-p is carried out by phosphatase phos <dig> whereas phos <dig> dephosphorylates both mkk and mk layers. under such conditions, equations
 <cit>  are modified as below

  dmkk-pdt=k <dig> mkkk-p.mkkk31+mkkk3+mkk-pk4-k <dig> mkkk-p.mkk-pk41+mkkk3+mkk-pk4+k <dig> phos <dig> mkk-ppk51+mkk-ppk5+mkk-pk6+mk-ppk9+mk-pk10-k <dig> phos <dig> mkk-pk61+mkk-ppk5+mkk-pk6+mk-ppk9+mk-pk <dig>

model m4k1
the system design is similar to the design of kinase phosphatase interactions in b cell signal mapk processing
 <cit> . here phos <dig> dephosphorylates mkkk and mkk whereas phos <dig> dephosphorylates mkk and mk. for this model, differential equations capturing the dynamics of mkkk-p, mk-p and mk-pp would be identical to equations ,  and  respectively. the dynamic equations for mkk layer would however be modified due to competition between phos <dig> and phos <dig> for the access to their mutual substrates mkk-p and mkk-pp, as given below:

  dmkk-pdt=k <dig> mkkk-p.mkkk31+mkkk3+mkk-pk4−k <dig> mkkk-p.mkk-pk41+mkkk3+mkk-pk4+k5a.phos <dig> mkk-ppk5a1+mkk-ppk5a+mkk-pk6a+mkkk-pk2a+k5b.phos <dig> mkk-ppk5b1+mkk-ppk5b+mkk-pk6b+mk-ppk9b+mk-pk10b−k6a.phos <dig> mkk-pk6a1+mkk-ppk5a+mkk-pk6a+mkkk-pk2a−k6b.phos <dig> mkk-pk6b1+mkk-ppk5b+mkk-pk6b+mk-ppk9b+mk-pk10b

in the equations  and , the suffix “a” and “b” associated with the parameter values represents parameters specific to phos <dig> and phos <dig> respectively.

phosphatase sequestration in k1/k2_qss models
sequestration of a phosphatase by its kinase is plausible when the unphosphorylated kinase has significant affinity to the phosphatase. when concentrations of kinases and phosphatases fall in the same order of magnitude, sequestration effect could alter the systems signal processing significantly
 <cit> . thus, as a result of phosphatase sequestration the dephosphorylation equations in – will have an additional term
kinasekse in the denominators where the “kinase” sequesters its phosphatase and “kse” is the equilibrium constant of the sequestrated fraction
 <cit> . for example, for the sequestrated condition of phos <dig> with mk, equation  would be modified to:

  dmk-ppdt=k <dig> mkk-pp.mk-pk81+mkk7+mk-pk8-k <dig> phos <dig> mk-ppk91+mkk-ppk5+mkk-pk6+mk-ppk9+mk-pk9+mkkse2+mkkkse <dig> 

in equation , kse <dig> is the equilibrium constant for sequestration of mk and mkk by phos <dig>  here sequestration of phos <dig> by its kinase is captured by the term
kinasekse <dig> and sequestration of phos <dig> by its kinase is captured by
kinasekse <dig> 

thus the model equations corresponding to different interaction topologies between kinases and phosphatases in m1-m <dig> were accordingly modified for the sequestrated conditions.

phosphatase sequestration in k <dig> models
sequestration results in a bound complex of unphosphorylated kinase with its phosphatase
 <cit> . for example, dephosphorylation of a phosphorylated kinase such as mkkk-p by its phosphatase phos <dig> in the unsequestrated conditions is given as

 mkkk-p+phos1⇔mkkk-p.phos1→mkkk+phos <dig>  

the effect of sequestration modifies the above reactions as,

 mkkk-p+phos1⇔mkkk-p.phos1→mkkk.phos1⇔mkkk+phos <dig>  

where the complex
mkkk.phos <dig> represents the sequestrated fraction. here, the completely dephosphorylated kinase forms a complex with its phosphatase in a reversible manner
 <cit> .

robustness analysis: robustness of the model output was calculated using the simulation software sbml-sat
 <cit> . following the previous studies, here the output robustness is calculated against the total parameter variation  where tpv represents the set of parameters that are subjected to random variations
 <cit> . tpv is given as,

 tpv=∑n=1llogknkn <dig>  

kn = randomly generated perturbed model parameter value and kn <dig> is the corresponding model parameter value in the unperturbed system. l is the total number of parameters subjected to variation.

robustness quantifies the change in the output characteristics of a model induced by the tpv and represented as
 <cit> :

 rf,tpvm=−∑p=1nlogfpf0n 

where
rf,tpvm is the robustness coefficient of the output f for a model “m” where f <dig> and fp are the output under the unperturbed and perturbed conditions respectively and n is total number of parameters varied.

thus, for the mapk cascades, robustness coefficient of the cascade output mk-pp was measured as:

 rmk−pp,tpvm=−∑p=1nlogmk−pppmk−pp0n, 

robustness by its definition is a negative quantity
 <cit> , implying that value of robustness coefficient closer to zero corresponds to more robust systems.

all the models had parameters and concentration values in the biologically observed range
 <cit>  which are shown in additional file
2: table s <dig> and table s <dig>  for robustness calculations, concentration values of kinases and phosphatases were sampled in the range of  <dig> - <dig> times their reference values  and the sample parameter sets with their sampling ranges are given in additional file
2: table s <dig>  sbml-sat samples the parameters using latin hypercube sampling 
 <cit> , where  <dig> equidistant samples from the minimum to the maximum  were drawn, for each parameter subjected to the perturbations. the perturbations were applied as global changes where a set of values of all the perturbed parameters were randomly chosen from the sample space for one simulation and for the next simulation another random set of parameters were picked from the sample space. the robustness coefficient was calculated as an averaged quantity
 <cit> , obtained from  <dig> simulations for each individual case study.

simulation software
models were first developed using copasi
 <cit>  and later imported in the matlab toolbox sbml-sat
 <cit>  for further simulations, robustness analysis and plotting. steady state calculations were performed using copasi.

RESULTS
computational models of mapk signaling cascade were built with michaelismenten kinetics  and elementary mass action kinetics  following the previous guidelines
 <cit> . mapk cascade has one phosphorylation-dephosphorylation step in the mkkk layer and two phosphorylation-dephosphorylation steps each in mkk and mk layers
 <cit> . differential equations capturing the dynamics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the kinases with k <dig> are shown in the methods sections. similarly the kinetic parameters capturing the dynamics of models with k <dig> can be found in the sbml models 17– <dig>  the kinetic parameters and concentrations of kinases and phosphatases used for the simulations are given in additional file
2: table s <dig> and s <dig> respectively.

relative robustness of the systems m1-m <dig> for unsequestrated and phosphatase sequestrated condition
robustness is a fundamental property of biological systems by virtue of which they tend to maintain their behaviour when subjected to random perturbations
 <cit> . robustness of the cascades was calculated for both unsequestrated  condition and phosphatase sequestrated  conditions, for both constant signal strength and variable signal strength conditions. here we represent the sequestration condition as pseq only when both phos <dig> and phos <dig> were assumed to be sequestrated. useq represents the biological condition where unphosphorylated kinases have negligible affinity to their phosphatases and pseq represents the condition where the unphosphorylated kinases have significant affinity to sequester their phosphatases
 <cit> .

a. robustness of models mik <dig>  i = 1…4
figure
 <dig> shows the comparative robustness of m1k1-m4k <dig> under useq and pseq conditions for both fixed input signal  conditions , and condition when sig was varied together with kinases  or phosphatases . the value of robustness is a negative quantity by definition
 <cit> , but for plotting purpose we have shown the absolute value of robustness coefficient . values of the robustness coefficients for useq and pseq conditions for all the models are given in additional file
2: table s <dig>  

for the systems subjected to constant signal and useq condition, the output mk-pp is more robust to kinases’ concentration variation  than the phosphatases’ concentration variation , but phosphatases’ sequestration dramatically enhanced the robustness of mk-pp to either types of perturbations . when the concentrations of kinases were varied together with sig , or when phosphatases’ concentrations were varied together with sig , changes in the robustness profile of mk-pp was maximum for kinases’ concentration variation in the useq condition . the figure demonstrates that robustness of mk-pp to perturbation in kinases’ concentration was decreased approximately  <dig> fold when sig was perturbed together with the kinases. the systems with pseq condition however showed little differences in robustness of mk-pp between perturbation in only kinases’ concentration  and perturbation in kinases + sig . the results show that phosphatases’ sequestration not only leads to dramatic gain of output robustness to perturbation in kinases/phosphatases concentrations, it also increases the systems robustness to random fluctuations in input signal strengths coupled to such variations. for all the perturbation conditions, the effect of sequestration most drastically alters the output robustness in the system m <dig> k <dig> and m <dig> k <dig>  between their respective useq and pseq conditions.

difference of robustness for the same set of perturbations but for two different conditions  for m1k1-m4k <dig> could be calculated as
 <cit> :

 rmk−pp,tpvmpseq,useq=rmk−pp,tpvmpseq−rmk−pp,tpvmuseq 

for example, when the phosphatases’ concentrations were perturbed , differences of robustness of mk-pp in the system m2k <dig> for pseq and useq conditions is calculated as follows

 rmk−pp,tpvm2pseq,useqk1phosphatase variation=− <dig> −− <dig> = <dig> . 

the values of robustness coefficients for useq  and pseq  conditions were computed using sbml-sat
 <cit>  and the values can be found in the additional file
2: table s <dig>  it could be seen that during perturbation of phosphatases’ concentrations in model m2k <dig>  pseq resulted in more than  <dig> fold increase in the robustness of mk-pp . amongst all the models, highest fold increase in robustness of mk-pp  between useq and pseq conditions for perturbations of phosphatases’ concentrations was observed for the system m4k <dig>  when sig was considered fixed during simulations .

similarly during the perturbation of kinase concentrations in the variable signal condition, robustness difference between useq and pseq was maximal for the model m <dig> , which is given as:

rmk−pp,tpvm4k1pseq,useqkinase variation=− <dig> −− <dig> = <dig> ,

 which is approximately  <dig> fold increase in robustness.

b. robustness of models mik <dig>  i = 1…4
the models m1-m <dig> built with k <dig>  exhibited similar pattern in changes in robustness of mk-pp for useq and pseq conditions as observed for k <dig> models. but unlike the k <dig> models where variation of sig + kinases’ concentration resulted in two fold decrease in robustness as compared to kinases’ concentration variation with constant sig , the k <dig> models showed very little change in mk-pp robustness while subjected to such perturbations . the simulations showed that the k <dig> models are more robust than the k <dig> models, specifically for useq condition. in the k <dig> models, enzyme substrate complex  captures fraction of the total kinases/phosphatases concentration. for example in m1k <dig> the terminal layer kinase mk’s total concentration  is considered distributed as

 mktotal=mk+mk−p+mk−pp, 

and in the m1k <dig> the mktotal is distributed as

 mktotal=mk+mk.mkk−pp+mk−p+mk−p.mkk−pp+mk−pp+mk−pp.phos3+mk−p.phos <dig>  

thus when concentration of mktotal is altered its effect is realized in three components in m1k <dig> model but in seven components in m1k <dig>  which implies, each of the intermediate components in m1k <dig> are relatively less affected by such changes as compared to the components in m1k <dig>  this could be seen in the differences in the relative changes in the flux of mk-pp phosphorylation when concentration of mktotal is varied. effect of variation of mk concentration  is shown for m1k <dig> and m1k <dig> in additional file
3: figure s <dig> which shows that the perturbation significantly altered the mk-pp phosphorylation flux in m1k <dig> whereas the same in m1k <dig> is relatively less affected by such perturbations.

further we tested the robustness of k2_qss models for identical perturbation conditions as applied to k <dig> models. additional file
4: figure s2a-d shows the robustness profiles of the four k2_qss models. the simulations show that unsequestrated systems are less robust than their respective sequestrated counterparts corroborating the earlier observations for k <dig>  models. mktotal in k <dig> has more intermediate components than in k2_qss; hence upon subjection to identical perturbation conditions, flux of the output’s phosphorylation is affected more severely in k2_qss models than in k <dig> models. it is thus observed that k2_qss built with symmetric parameter sets adopted from k <dig>  exhibited lower robustness, specifically for the useq conditions . it can be noted that in the pseq condition, all the k2_qss models exhibited remarkable robustness to phosphatase variations . such gain in robustness in k2_qss models  owes its origin in the phosphatase sequestration strength in k2_qss. as calculated from the k <dig> models, the sequestration strength  used in k2_qss is  <dig> nm, and the km values for dephosphorylation are  <dig> orders of magnitude higher than the kseq values. such low kseq values significantly reduce the flux of dephosphorylation under the pseq conditions, so during the phosphatase variation we observed such remarkable gain of robustness in all the k2_qss models. however when the kseq in k2_qss was assumed to be in similar order of magnitude as in k <dig>  changes in robustness profile in k2_qss upon phosphatase variation becomes similar to that of k <dig> .

thus primarily, the output responses to all the applied perturbations in models with k <dig> and k <dig> kinetics were corroborating with each other , for both useq and pseq conditions. we also varied the kinetic parameters in both k <dig> and k <dig> models for both useq and pseq conditions. additional file
5: figure s
3a and additional file
6: figure s
3b shows robustness of mk-pp to perturbations in kinetic parameters in both k <dig> and k <dig> models respectively, where we found that pseq enhanced robustness in all the models, a similar effect as observed during perturbation in concentrations of the kinases/phosphatases .

altogether these analyses reveals that robustness of mapk cascade output is differentially shaped by various designs of interactions among its kinases and phosphatases, and phosphatase sequestration enhances output robustness for all such designs of interactions. we show the generalized nature of the result by building and analyzing the interaction designs using both k <dig> and k <dig>  here each of the interactions between the kinases and phosphatases shown in the models m1-m <dig> were built based on the various observed architectures of in-vivo mapk cascades. for example, biological counterpart of phos <dig> in the system m <dig> is the phosphatase pp2a and phos <dig> represents the phosphatase mkp <dig>  since it was observed that pp2a dephosphorylates both mkkk and mkk
 <cit>  and mkp <dig> dephosphorylates both mkk and mk
 <cit> . thus our studies provided a comparative demonstration of the significance of rewiring of connections between the kinases and phosphatases in shaping the robustness of the mapk cascade.

an implicit negative feedback loop from phos <dig> controls the amplitude of mkkk-p in the mapk cascade m4
in addition to the basic kinase phosphatase interactions leading to flow of signal through the signaling cascades, feedback loops both explicit and implicit in nature render additional fine tuning of the propagated information
 <cit> . the explicit feedback loops are mainly manifested as physical interaction between the feedback origin and destination, for example, the negative feedback loop where phosphorylated erk  physically bind and inhibit the catalytic activity of raf- <dig> 
 <cit> . on the other hand the implicit feedback loops emerges from the dynamics of a system where the feedback origin and destinations may not physically interact with each other
 <cit> . implicit feedback loops are usually hard to detect experimentally as structural organization of the kinases and phosphatases doesn’t usually reflect presence of such implicit feedback loops, unlike the explicit feedback loops which are hardwired in the systems structure
 <cit> .

we unraveled a novel implicit negative feedback loop in the mapk cascade m <dig>  it could be noted that among the four types of interaction topologies , only in m <dig> two phosphatases phos <dig> and phos <dig> have to compete for their common substrates mkk-p and mkk-pp . we found that, as a consequence of competition between phos <dig> and phos <dig> in m <dig>  an implicit negative feedback emerges from phos <dig> to mkkk layer. phos <dig> controlled the mkkk-p amplitude without physically binding and dephosphorylating mkkk-p .

the implicit feedback loop was found to be operational in both m4k <dig>  and m4k <dig> . it was also found that pseq can reduce the strength and even abolish the effect of the feedback loop, in both the model types. figure
4a shows the mkkk-p amplitude of m4k <dig> for useq. in the useq conditions, mkkk-p amplitude for a low phos <dig> concentration  is approximately double the mkkk-p amplitude for high phos <dig> concentration . for the pseq condition in m4k <dig>  mkkk-p amplitude showed no changes when phos <dig> concentration was varied , implying that the implicit feedback loop was completely abolished as a consequence of pseq. figure
4c shows the phase plot where steady state maximum amplitude of mkkk-p is plotted against the total concentration of phos <dig>  for various values of phos <dig> for m4k <dig>  similarly for m4k <dig>  we found that changes in phos <dig> concentration alters the amplitudes of mkkk-p , and pseq shielded the negative feedback from phos <dig> to mkkk-p . it could be noted that the extent of shielding of the negative feedback in the pseq condition is different for both the model types . when k2_qss models were subjected to the identical conditions, mkkk-p amplitudes  were changed as a result of changes in the phos <dig> concentration. this suggests that the implicit negative feedback loop could be observed in a system adopting qss, when originally its counterpart with mass action kinetics also exhibits presence of such feedback loop. the relation between the phosphatases’ concentration and respective steady state mkkk-p amplitude is shown in figure
5e  and figure
5f . in all the m <dig> models  mkkk-p amplitude in useq conditions changes in definite ranges of phos <dig> concentration values, above and below which the mkkk-p amplitudes are almost unaffected . in m4k <dig> for the useq condition, mkkk-p amplitude is affected by phos <dig> concentration only after phos <dig> crosses a certain concentration  and further increase in phos <dig> concentration significantly inhibits mkkk-p amplitude until phos <dig> reaches certain concentration , beyond which increase in phos <dig> concentration only asymptotically decreased the mkkk-p amplitude . in m4k <dig> under the useq conditions, the effect was observed more switch-like, where for a relatively narrower range of phos <dig> concentration  mkkk-p amplitude reached from maximum to minimum . the range even narrows for m4k2_qss where the changes in mkkk-p amplitude were observed for phos <dig> concentration between ~200- <dig> nm and the sharp switch like changes in mkkk-p concentration as observed for m4k <dig> can also be observed for m4k2_qss.

it can be noted that m4k <dig> showed decrease in the mkkk-p amplitude with increase in phos <dig> concentration for the pseq conditions which is due to the  weakly functional feedback loop from phos <dig> to mkkk-p in the mass action model. in m4k <dig> lower values of phos <dig> concentration didn’t affect mkkk-p amplitude but as the phos <dig> concentration increases , the enhanced phos <dig> concentration starts to compensate for the reduction in feedback strength due to the sequestration, resulting in inhibition of mkkk-p amplitude in the pseq condition. but as we implement steady state in m4k <dig>  i.e. in case of m4k2_qss , the effect of phosphatase sequestration completely shielded the negative regulation of mkkk-p by phos <dig> 

strength of the implicit feedback loop is reciprocally controlled by the strength of phosphatases sequestration
as the dynamics of m4k <dig> and m4k <dig> are governed by fundamentally different types of rate equations, the relative differences in the effect of pseq in modulating the negative feedback strength in both the model types is not unexpected. as both the models showed changes in the similar direction in mkkk-p amplitude in the pseq condition , we next compared the effect of variable sequestration strengths in both m4k <dig> and m4k <dig>  for the analysis, we varied the sequestration strengths in both the models, while keeping all the other model parameters constant and plotted the steady state mkkk-p amplitude differences for phos2 =  <dig> nm  and phos2 =  <dig> nm . figure
6a shows the differences in the mkkk-p amplitudes of m4k <dig>  it was observed that as a function of increasing strengths of sequestration, the differences in mkkk-p amplitudes for the high and low value of phos <dig> decreases, and after certain strength of sequestration , changes in the phos <dig> concentration couldn’t affect the mkkk-p amplitude. figure
6b shows the results of variation in the pseq strength for m4k <dig> which demonstrates that sufficiently strong phosphatase sequestration  could abolish the negative feedback loop completely, resulting in an unaltered mkkk-p amplitude for both phos2 =  <dig> and  <dig> nm. in m4k <dig>  the sequestration strength was changed by changing all the values of kseq in the dephosphorylation equations corresponding to phos <dig> and phos <dig>  that is operational from phos <dig> to mkkk layer, which is not a physical interaction between phos <dig> and mkkk. the thickness of the feedback loop is shown as the indicative of strength of the loop where the illustration qualitatively demonstrates the reciprocal relation between sequestration and feedback strengths.

proposed experimental verification of the implicit negative feedback loop
the negative feedback loop from mkp <dig>  to raf- <dig>  revealed from our studies could be tested in the cells that expresses the mapk cascades together with the phosphatases mkp <dig> and pp2a and exhibits kinase-phosphatase interactions as shown in model m <dig>  closest to design of m <dig> is the naturally occurring mapk cascade in the b cells
 <cit> . although there are other phosphatases, such as pp <dig> and mkp <dig> for carrying out dephosphorylation
 <cit> , strong experimental perturbations in the concentrations of mkp <dig> should still visibly change the wild type amplitude of mkkk-p , and would expose the implicit negative feedback from mkp <dig> to mkkk-p. perturbation in wild type concentration of mkp <dig> could be carried out in two opposite ways: inhibition or overexpression. methodology of inhibition of mkp <dig> concentration by small interfering rna  and overexpression of mkp <dig> by lentiviral overexpression could be found from a recent study
 <cit> . thus comparing the kinetics of wild type amplitude of raf-1-p with both mkp <dig> inhibited and overexpressed conditions would plausibly expose the novel implicit negative feedback hidden in the cascade. notably, this experimental setup could compare the effects of phosphatase sequestration on the mkkk-p amplitude. according to our model predictions, experiments with both inhibition and overexpression of mkp <dig> should minimally alter the raf-1-p amplitude if the in-vivo system is strongly sequestrated. if large changes in the raf-1-p amplitudes are observed for perturbations in the mkp- <dig> concentrations, one can infer that the system has weak sequestration. testing the presence of the implicit negative feedback loop could be done in an alternate and perhaps more convincing way, by building a synthetic mapk cascade
 <cit> , where various designs of kinases and phosphatases interactions could be implemented and tested in future.

designs of kinases -phosphatases interaction differentially determine the memory of an input signal and pseq enhances the systems memory
it was observed that biological signals of both sustained and transient types have physiological significance. for example, transient phosphorylation of erk  triggers proliferation whereas sustained phosphorylation triggers cell division as observed in the mammalian pc <dig> cells
 <cit> . in our previous analysis we used the signal duration  as a sustained quantity, so we next investigated how the models with differential designs of kinases and phosphatases interaction would respond to input stimuli of transient type.

we subjected the systems m1k <dig> k2-m4k <dig> k <dig> to signals of identical strength  and duration . figure
7a-d shows the effect of removal of sig at  <dig> s on the output mk-pp of m1k1-m4k <dig>  after the removal of the signal, in the useq condition, the systems m1k <dig> and m2k <dig> exhibited minimum  and maximum  durations of their respective output’s phosphorylation. notably, in an earlier experiment in mouse nih- <dig> t <dig> fibroblasts, where the kinase phosphatase interaction topology resembles that of system m <dig>  a prolonged activation of mk-pp  was observed when the mapk cascade was subjected to a signal of only  <dig> min duration
 <cit> . so amongst the four different designs, the system m2k <dig> is most suitable when a prolonged memory of a short duration signal is needed to be preserved, specifically in the useq condition. we next found that pseq can increase each of the systems output memory  and the maximum output memory in the pseq condition is exhibited by m2k <dig>  thus the system with minimum memory in the useq condition has minimum memory in the pseq condition and vice versa. 

figure
8a-d shows the mk-pp amplitude of m1k2-m4k <dig> subjected to signals of identical strengths and duration as the k <dig> models. here, in the useq condition, the maximum duration of the output was exhibited by the system m2k <dig> , and in the sequestrated condition, memory of the output signal was enhanced for all the models, which is in the same lines as observed in case of the k <dig> models. while subjected to similar conditions the models with k2_qss exhibited output memory in the same order of magnitude as k <dig>  models in the useq condition. but sequestration strength in k2_qss being higher than the other binding constants , flux of dephosphorylation of the kinases decreases significantly, during the pseq conditions. this results in prolongation of the activation time of the kinases, increasing the output memory by several orders of magnitudes as compared to their useq counterparts. but output memory of k2_qss systems in pseq conditions could be easily achieved in similar orders of magnitude to the k <dig> systems only by readjusting the sequestration strengths, while keeping rest of the model parameters constant .

for identical parametric conditions such as among m1k <dig> -m4k <dig> or among m1k2-m4k <dig>  the difference in the output memory in response to the signals of identical strength and duration could be explained from the mechanistic details of the systems. here the systems with specific phosphatases of mkkk layer  experiences stronger dephosphorylation of mkkk-p resulting in rapid termination of mkkk-p amplitude. termination of mkkk-p stops the phosphorylation of the downstream mkk which in turn stops phosphorylation of the output layer mk. but when phosphatases were shared between mkkk and mkk layer , the total concentration of the phosphatase is divided between both the layers resulting in relatively weaker dephosphorylation of mkkk-p. additionally, as cellular concentration of mkkk is less than that of mkk
 <cit> , and as mkk has two but mkkk has one phosphorylated form, relatively more phos <dig> binds to mkk as compared to mkkk. thus in the useq condition the system m2k <dig> k <dig> exhibited maximum memory followed by the system m4k <dig> k <dig>  here m4k <dig> k <dig> has lesser memory than m <dig> due to competition of phos <dig> and phos <dig> to dephosphorylate the mkk layer, thus facilitating more of phos <dig> to dephosphorylate mkkk-p in m4k <dig> k <dig> than in m2k <dig> k <dig>  upon pseq, the availability of the phosphatases for the dephosphorylation process further decreases resulting in enhancement of the mk-pp amplitude in all the system types. however a difference in the relative changes in the mk-pp duration between useq and pseq conditions was noticeable between the k <dig>  and k <dig> models . the k <dig> models exhibited longer output memory than the k <dig> models for both useq and pseq conditions. the difference between two types of models is more prominent for the pseq conditions. the differences primarily arise due to lesser number of steps travelled by the signal from the input to the output layer in the k <dig> model compared to the k <dig> models. such differences in the memory of a signal can be seen building simple toy cycles of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation using k <dig> kinetics and its qss counterpart, where it could be seen that a double phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles in k <dig> exhibits higher memory of a identical signal as compared to that in k2_qss .

next to understand the role of different strengths of input stimuli in deciding the output duration and amplitude we varied the signal strength  in a wider range. figure
9a-h shows the phase plots for the m1k1-m4k <dig> and figure
10a-h shows the phase plot of m1k2-m4k <dig>  for both useq and pseq conditions. the figures show that pseq significantly lowers the threshold of mk-pp activation and signal duration increases as a result of pseq. it can be noted that in both useq and pseq conditions signal amplitude increases in similar directions in k <dig> and k <dig> models, until it reaches a saturation concentration. however in k <dig> models in the pseq conditions, decrease in signal duration for increase in signal strength was observed . in the lower signal doses the extent of kinases’ phosphorylation is less as compared to the higher signal doses. this means that in the lower doses amount of the system’s phosphatases captured in the sequestrated fraction are more as compared to the higher doses where more kinases are available as phosphorylated fractions. hence relatively less number of phosphatases will be available for the dephosphorylation process in the lower signal doses as compared to the higher signal doses. under such conditions when the incoming signal  is removed at a predefined time  the extent of dephosphorylation after the removal of signal will be more in the systems subjected to higher signal doses, reducing the signal durations accordingly . however when the k2_qss models in pseq conditions were subjected to a spectrum of signals, the changes in the signal durations with increasing signal strengths, are in similar directions as observed in the k <dig> models . this is because the k2_qss models consider contributions from the enzyme-substrate complexes as constants and the initial reductions in the signal durations with increase in ‘sig’ values are not captured in k2_qss models unlike in the k <dig> models.

CONCLUSIONS
the mapk cascade is called the backbone of signal processing and integration in the living systems as it accurately delivers pre-coded messages from various receptors to specific nuclear targets
 <cit> . such reliability of information processing requires robustness of the system as the robust systems shield their output functions from random perturbation
 <cit> . a large volume of closely coupled modeling and experimental studies have been conducted in the recent years which exposed a plethora of system level regulatory principles associated with the mapk cascade
 <cit> . however until now, the computational models of the mapk cascade haven’t specifically addressed the significance of different designs of kinase-phosphatase interactions in the three layer cascade, particularly from the context of their role in shaping the robustness and signal response behaviours. here, we built computational models of four experimentally observed designs of interactions among the kinases and phosphatases of the mapk cascade and compared the robustness and signal response behavior associated with each of the designs. to elucidate the generalized nature of behaviors emerging pivotally from the different designs of interactions among kinases and phosphatase in the mapk cascade, we carried out our studies adopting both steady state kinetics  and elementary mass action kinetics . both the k <dig> and k <dig> models uses different parameter sets and hence results among k <dig> and k <dig> are not directly comparable to each other; so the only comparison intended here was among the four types of k <dig> models or among the four types of k <dig> models. however we also tested the effect of quasi steady state assumptions on the k <dig> models and studied whether properties emerging out of different designs of kinases-phosphatase interactions in k <dig> are preserved in its steady state counterparts as well. .

firstly, we found that robustness of the output of mapk cascades is function of the design of interactions among the kinases and phosphatases of the cascade, implying, each of the interaction design has unique way of responding to identical external perturbation. we also found that phosphatase sequestration  dramatically enhances the robustness in all the system types . phosphatase sequestration also enhanced the output robustness in all the models when signal strength was considered to be a variable quantity coupled to the variations in kinases/phosphatases concentrations . in the living systems, the mapk cascade transmit both short and long duration signals where short duration signals trigger proliferation and long duration signals trigger cell differentiation
 <cit> . thus, although the concentrations of kinases and phosphatases remain practically constant during a proliferation signal, during differentiation signal, the concentrations of both might change considerably. the changes in concentrations could be due to 1] nuclear compartmentalization of mk-pp
 <cit> , 2] enhancement of total concentration of various phosphatases due to transcriptional induction
 <cit>  or 3] due to differences in rates of degradation and rate of transcriptional induction of the kinases and phosphatases
 <cit> , resulting in ever fluctuating concentrations of signaling proteins . it was demonstrated recently that erk-pp  amplitude could be robustly maintained during fluctuations in the erk concentration, owing to a strong negative feedback loop from raf- <dig> to erk
 <cit> . our study revealed plausible alternate cellular strategies for achieving robustness against perturbations in kinases’/phosphatases’ concentrations. this is because robustness of the cascade output is a function of kinases-phosphatases interaction design and is also dependent on whether or not the phosphatases of the cascade are sequestrated.

we revealed an implicit negative feedback loop from the phosphatase phos <dig>  to the remote upstream kinase mkkk  in the mapk cascade type m <dig> . we found that strength of the feedback loop was reciprocally controlled by the strength of phosphatase sequestration in both m4k <dig> and m4k <dig> . we also showed the implications of quasi steady state assumptions on m4k <dig>  in both useq and pseq conditions on the strength of implicit feedback loop . when phos <dig> concentration was varied and corresponding steady state mkkk-p concentration was plotted, a switch like relation between the phos <dig> concentration and mkkk-p was obtained, for m4k <dig> m4k <dig>  and m4k2_qss . in useq condition, mkkk-p amplitude in both m4k <dig> and m4k <dig> assumes a higher value for a range of phos <dig> concentration, but once phos <dig> concentration crosses a threshold concentration, mkkk-p amplitude rapidly attains a lower value and remains less sensitive to further changes in phos <dig> concentrations. simulation of the models with variation of their sequestration strength revealed that feedback loop from phos <dig> to mkkk-p could be abolished in both m4k <dig> and m4k <dig> by increasing the phosphatase sequestration strengths. hence we show here for the first time how strength of an implicit negative feedback loop can be regulated in a mapk cascade via seemingly unrelated mechanism like phosphatase sequestration. it could be noted that control of the strength of the implicit feedback loop through adjustment of the sequestration strength is a robust property of a mapk cascade such as m <dig>  as both m4k <dig> and m4k <dig>  exhibited similar relation between sequestration strength and the strength of the implicit negative feedback loop.

the systems m1k <dig> k2-m4k <dig> k <dig> were subjected to transient input signal and output memory of each of the system was comparatively shown. results show that the system with high robustness  in useq and pseq conditions also exhibits long signal memory , where pseq enhances the memory of a transient signal in all the system types. the mapk cascade can prolong or terminate the output duration, plausibly according to individual cellular requirements, by differentially rewiring the kinase-phosphatase interactions while keeping rest of the model parameters unchanged. we show that pseq also adds on to the output duration and readjustment of sequestration strength can facilitate the system to control the output memory further. for example, if a mapk cascade has to maintain steady amplitude of mk-pp in response to transient signals arriving at long intervals for both useq and pseq conditions, the most successful design for the purpose would be m <dig> . figure
8b shows that a signal terminated at  <dig> s could reappear again at ~  <dig> s, but the steady maximum amplitude of mk-pp will be maintained. however if the cascade needs to kill its output  quickly before the next signal arrives then the designs m <dig> and m <dig> would be better than the designs m <dig> and m <dig>  specifically in the useq conditions. in an experiment on nih- <dig> t <dig> fibroblast cell lines , it was observed that prolonged activation of mk-pp  could be achieved in response to a signal of  <dig> min duration
 <cit> . but the causality behind such prolonged duration of mk-pp activation was not examined from the perspective of interaction design between the kinases and phosphatases. one can argue from our study that the mapk cascade such as the ones present in the nih- <dig> t <dig> fibroblast cells exhibits long term signal memory due to its kinase-phosphatase interaction design, and additionally, perhaps due to presence of stronger phosphatase sequestrations.

further, we simulated m1k <dig> k2-m4k <dig> k <dig> for variable signal strengths, where results primarily showed that pseq leads to enhancement of output amplitude and memory as compared to their useq counterparts at all signal doses . the analyses also exposed the robustness trade off in the pseq systems: pseq could lead to activation of the mapk cascades starting from a very small range of input signal , thus lowering the activation threshold significantly, which means, the ability to robustly maintain the output in the pseq conditions comes with the disadvantage of picking up noisy/spurious signals originating from the random fluctuations in the environment. taken together, we show that rewiring of kinase phosphatase interactions and phosphatases sequestration in the mapk cascade can have unique roles in determining the fate of processed signals. based on our study it could be argued that differential designs of kinases-phosphatases interactions may have evolved to satisfy specific cellular requirements, such that need based specificity in signaling could be achieved in a non-trivial manner adopting a certain design of interaction among the phosphatases of the system. additionally the extent/strength of phosphatase sequestration adopted by a cascade would uniquely contribute towards adjusting its activation threshold and thus discriminate the noise from the signal in a context dependent manner.
