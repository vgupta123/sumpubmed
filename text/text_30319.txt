BACKGROUND
calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine threonine phosphatase, is an important signalling molecule in skeletal muscle, as it promotes differentiation, the slow-fibre phenotype, and possibly also fibre hypertrophy. calcineurin binds to the calsarcins, a family of muscle proteins that are specific to the sarcomeric z-disc, which is a focal point in the regulation of contraction both in skeletal and cardiac muscle. calsarcin- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> all interact with calcineurin and the z-disc proteins α-actinin, γ-filamin, myotilin, telethonin and cipher  <cit> . several groups have independently identified the calsarcin family and termed it calsarcin  <cit> , fatz  <cit> , myozenin  <cit> , and c4orf <dig>  <cit> , in separate reports. the calsarcins may also have a structural role in z-disc assembly via their ability to bind different z-disc proteins, as well as a possible involvement in signalling pathways that are activated via their binding to calcineurin.

cs- <dig> is the only member of the calsarcin family that is expressed in the adult heart and in slow-twitch skeletal muscle, whereas cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> are expressed in fast-twitch muscle  <cit> . several studies have also shown that calcineurin controls the skeletal muscle fibre type by stimulating slow muscle gene promoters and slow fibre differentiation both in cultured cells and in vivo  <cit> . in addition, cs- <dig> knockout mice show enhanced calcineurin signalling and an excess of slow skeletal muscle fibres, indicating that cs- <dig> negatively modulates the function of calcineurin  <cit> . given that both the functions and substrate specificity of calcineurin are modulated by the calsarcins, and that calcineurin operates in the signalling pathways that control the muscle fibre type, a mechanism of muscle fibre determination and differentiation that is regulated by the interactions between calcineurin and the calsarcins can possibly be hypothesized. however, whether the fibre type-specific expression of calsarcins is also controlled by calcineurin remains to be determined.

in our current study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of the mouse cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> genes, with a particular focus on the promoter sequences of these genes as they are responsive to calcineurin signalling.

RESULTS
determination of transcription start sites  for mouse cs- <dig> and cs-2
to further characterize the transcriptional control of the mouse cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> genes, we first determined their respective transcription start sites. rt-pcr analysis was performed using total rna extracts of c2c <dig> cells and four different forward primers and one reverse primer for each gene. as shown in table  <dig>  the reverse primer is located in exon  <dig> and the different forward primers are located around the putative transcription start sites. the results of these analyses show that the first three primer pairs of cs- <dig>  and first two for cs- <dig>  successfully yielded pcr products. this indicates that the sequences contained within these oligonucleotides form part of the mrna product of each gene . we concluded that the tss sites of mouse cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> are located at - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig>  respectively. the nucleotide immediately upstream of the translation initiation codon  is denoted as - <dig> 

transcriptional regulation of cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> during myogenic differentiation
real-time pcr analysis was performed to determine the relative mrna expression levels of both the mouse cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> genes during myoblast differentiation in c2c <dig> cells. specific primers corresponding to the two genes were designed and the housekeeping gene β-actin was used as a control. we subsequently found that the cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> transcript levels were both low at the myoblast stage. cs- <dig> mrna expression increases markedly, however, during the first two days of differentiation and is then maintained at relatively abundant levels throughout this process. in contrast, the cs- <dig> transcript levels remain low throughout myogenic differentiation .

promoter analysis of the mouse cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> gene
to test the minimal region required for promoter activity within the upstream cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> sequences, fragments corresponding to the regions - <dig> to - <dig> of cs- <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig> of cs- <dig> , were inserted into the pgl3-basic vector and luciferase assays were performed. a significant increase in luciferase activity was observed in the c2c <dig> cell line  compared with cells transfected with the empty vector . sequence analysis of these two promoter segments revealed that the flanking region harbours potential binding sites for multiple transcription factors including sp <dig> and ap- <dig>  in addition to the muscle specific transcription factors mef- <dig> and myod. however, no tata-boxes are present in these regions.

we next generated a series of deletion mutants for the cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> promoters via pcr-based approaches using the pcs1-2554/- <dig> and pcs2-2478/- <dig> constructs as templates. the amplified mutant fragments were then subcloned into the pgl3-basic vector and our results are shown in figure  <dig>  for the cs- <dig> promoter fragments, the deletion constructs pcs1-1954/- <dig> and pcs1-1206/- <dig> display high promoter activity. further deletions at positions - <dig>  and - <dig>  resulted in a gradual decrease in promoter activity. however, the highest promoter activity levels were observed for the pcs1-427/- <dig> construct, suggesting that there are inhibitory elements within the region - <dig> to - <dig>  deletions at positions - <dig> and - <dig> also reduce promoter activity dramatically, whereas the pcs1-199/- <dig> construct shows almost no luciferase activity . taken together, these reporter data indicate that the core region of the basal promoter of mouse cs- <dig> gene is located within the region - <dig> to - <dig>  for the cs- <dig> promoter, the deletion constructs pcs2-1859/- <dig>  pcs2-1166/- <dig> and pcs2-561/- <dig> display high promoter activity with only modest differences between them, suggesting that each harbours the core elements necessary for the basal promoter function of the mouse cs- <dig> gene. the promoter activity of pcs2-482/- <dig>  pcs2-333/- <dig> and pcs2-185/- <dig> decreases gradually to relatively low levels and thus further defines the core region from - <dig> to - <dig> .

for our initial characterization of these two promoters, we searched for the presence of a consensus slow upstream regulatory element  and fast intronic regulatory element , which have been shown to drive fibre-specific gene transcription  <cit> . however, neither of these sites was found to be present in the two respective promoter regions after careful analysis using tess software. we then focused on the association of other transcription factors with the two gene promoters, such as the role of calcineurin signalling factors in activating the slow-fibre specific promoter of cs- <dig>  it was noticeable that the pcs1-427/- <dig> construct exhibited maximum activity and that deletion of the region - <dig> to - <dig> of cs- <dig> 5' flanking sequence reduced the promoter activity dramatically, indicating that a strongly positive element is located in this region. a putative binding site for the nf-κb transcription factor was detectable in this region using high-stringency analysis of the tess database. however, a putative binding site for nf-κb was also assigned to the core region of cs- <dig> promoter in these searches. since our reporter assay findings raised the possibility that transactivation of the mouse cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> gene may be achieved through nf-κb binding elements present in their core promoters, we attempted to determine which of these two potential nf-κb binding sites was authentic during this activation event.

confirmation of nf-κb binding to the cs- <dig> promoter by emsa
we synthesized specific oligonucleotides containing the nf-κb elements present in the cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> promoters and tested them with an nf-κb consensus sequence control in emsa experiments with nuclear extracts from c2c <dig> myotubes. as shown in figure 4a, incubation of c2c <dig> nuclear extracts with both the nf-κb consensus sequence and nf-κb-cs <dig> sequence produced a dna-protein band shift. in contrast, the nf-κb-cs <dig> oligonucleotide probe failed to form such a complex in this experiment. these dna-protein complexes were determined to be specific to the nf-κb sites by successful competition assays using excess unlabeled consensus and nf-κb-cs <dig> oligonucleotides . to confirm the binding of nf-κb family members to the nf-κb-cs <dig> sequence, these emsa reactions were further incubated with antibodies raised against p <dig> of nf-κb. as shown in figure 4b, the addition of this antibody resulted in a supershifted complex in addition to the dna-protein band. these data confirm the presence of the nf-κb family member, p <dig>  in the nuclear protein complex that binds the nf-κb binding site of the cs- <dig> promoter.

the inhibition of nf-κb downregulates cs- <dig> promoter activity but does not affect cs-2
to further illustrate the biological importance of nf-κb in the regulation of cs- <dig>  we inhibited nf-κb transactivation by treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , a proven free radical scavenger that accelerates iκb dissociation with a resulting block in nf-κb transport to the nucleus and subsequent binding to dna. as shown in figure  <dig>  when c2c <dig> cells were transfected with the  <dig> -kb wild type cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> promoter luciferase reporter plasmids, a 20-fold and 16-fold increase in reporter activity was observed, respectively. the treatment of these cells with pdtc induces a modest decrease in luciferase activity for both wild-type reporter plasmids, and had no impact on the empty vector control . transfection of the shorter cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> promoter fragment reporters , both containing their respective putative nf-κb elements, results in a 25-fold and 10-fold increase in luciferase activity, respectively. in this same experiment, pdtc treatment induced a 2–3-fold decrease in luciferase activity for cs- <dig> but no apparent changes were evident for the cs- <dig> reporter activities. however, when cells were transfected with the cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> reporter plasmids containing proximally shorter promoter fragments , we again detected a large increase in luciferase activity compared with the empty vector, but pdtc has no effects. these data suggest that the nf-κb binding element located in the region - <dig> to - <dig> of cs- <dig> promoter plays an important role in the transcriptional activity of this gene.

the effects of nf-κb, nfat and mef <dig> overexpression upon the cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> promoters
since putative nfat and mef <dig> binding elements are located within the cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> promoters, the sensitivities of the nfat and mef <dig> sites, as well as nf-κb site, to the overexpression of specific transcription factors were also determined. first, the  <dig> -kb wild type cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> promoters were cotransfected with preceiver-nf-κb <dig>  which constitutively expresses the nf-κb subunit gene p <dig>  the overexpression of p <dig> significantly induces cs- <dig> promoter activity and also the positive nf-κb reporter control . a further 5' deletion of the nf-κb site totally abolishes the response to nf-κb overexpression, reconfirming the authenticity of this site. however, the activity of cs- <dig> promoter was found to be increased by  <dig> -fold when cotransfected with nf-κb in these experiments, indicating that cs- <dig> is not independent of nf-κb. this partially contradicts the results of our gel shift and drug treatment experiments. hence, other nf-κb elements may exist in the cs- <dig> promoter or it may be triggered by other factors induced by nf-κb.

as a preliminary test for the role of the calcineurin-nfat-mef <dig> signalling pathway  <cit>  in the regulation of the calsarcin promoters, we next determined whether the cs- <dig> or cs- <dig> promoters are sensitive to the overexpression of nfat or mef <dig> in c2c <dig> cells. when cotransfected with the nfatc <dig> expression plasmid , both of the promoters show enhanced transcription activities, but to different extents . however, only a moderate decrease in promoter activity was observed after 5' deletion of the - <dig> to - <dig> region of cs- <dig> promoter which harbours a nfat consensus element, indicating that other putative binding motifs are present. similarly, mef2c overexpression was achieved by cotransfection of preceiver-mef2c with the luciferase reporter vector. this overexpression induces the activity of the cs- <dig> promoter by  <dig> -fold but has only marginal effects upon the cs- <dig> promoter. this indicates that mef <dig> also contributes to the differential transcription of the calsarcins in different fibres. however, it is noteworthy that both promoters contain several putative mef <dig> binding elements .

discussion
the differences in the contractile and biochemical properties of slow- and fast-twitch myofibres are determined by the selective transcription of genes coding for contractile proteins and metabolic enzymes in these muscles. these distinctive programs of gene expression are further controlled by various regulatory elements and pathways, such as the calcineurin signalling pathway, which still require further elucidation. one approach to further understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling muscle diversification and plasticity is to identify the dna regulatory sequences that control the fibre-type-specific expression of contractile protein genes. the study of the transcriptional regulation of fibre-type-specific calsarcins, which is also a family of calcineurin-interaction proteins, would contribute to our understanding of the role of calcineurin in muscle fibre differentiation.

in our present study, we determined by rt-pcr that the transcription start sites of the mouse cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> genes are in the regions - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig> upstream of the atg initiation codon, respectively. we then isolated the promoter regions of these mouse calsarcin genes by pcr. in order to identify their cis-regulatory elements, a series of deletion constructs from the 5'-flanking regions were analyzed. for cs- <dig>  we found that a construct containing a putative nf-κb site demonstrated the highest promoter activity levels. we thus speculated that this potential binding site for nf-κb and other putative transcription factor sites in this region would be important for the expression of the cs- <dig> gene. a significant decrease in cs- <dig> promoter reporter activity was indeed observed after the further deletion of this nf-κb element. it is thus quite likely that the nf-κb site in the cs- <dig> promoter contributes greatly to its transactivation. however, a putative nf-κb site is also located in the core region of cs- <dig> promoter, but our deletion reporter analysis did not reveal any significant involvement of this element in the transcriptional control of cs- <dig> 

gel retardation assays were performed to validate the binding of nf-κb to the core promoter regions of cs- <dig> and cs- <dig>  a cs- <dig> nf-κb sequence probe was found to induce a bandshift when incubated with nuclear extracts from c2c <dig> myotubes in a similar manner to the nf-κb consensus sequence control. however, no such band was evident when these extracts were incubated with a cs- <dig> nf-κb sequence. competition and supershift emsa experiments further confirmed that the nf-κb element in the core region of the cs- <dig> promoter is recognized by the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb. moreover, treatment with an nf-κb inhibitor  resulted in a dramatic reduction in reporter gene activity of the deletion fragment pcs1-427/- <dig>  which harbours the nf-κb binding element, with a modest decrease evident in the activity of the wild-type cs- <dig> promoter in this experiment. in contrast, none of the additional reporter constructs showed any pdtc responsiveness. in addition, the region located upstream of the nf-κb element in the cs- <dig> promoter appears to contain suppressive elements that reduce the effects of this inhibitor. overexpression of p <dig> of nf-κb increases the activity of the cs- <dig> promoter significantly, but no real change was evident for cs- <dig> in this analysis. taken together, these data suggest that nf-κb plays a critical role in the transcriptional activity of the mouse cs- <dig> gene, but does not play the same role for cs- <dig> 

several studies have previously demonstrated that calcineurin stimulates slow muscle gene promoters and slow fibre differentiation, both in culture and in vivo, via the calcineurin-nfat signalling pathway  <cit> . this mechanism has also been found to be active for many type-specific genes harbouring a sure element  in the slow promoter, and a fire element in the fast promoter  <cit> . however, no effects of calcineurin on slow muscle gene expression have been observed in other studies based either on csa treatment  <cit>  or on the overexpression of calcineurin and nfat  <cit> . in our present study, sequencing analyses did not reveal any consensus sure or fire elements within the cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> gene promoters, but putative nfat binding sites were evident in both of these promoters by tess analysis. to determine whether nfat or mef <dig> are involved in the transcription regulation of these genes, we overexpressed nfatc <dig> and mef2c and compared the resulting the promoter activities with their corresponding basal levels. the cs- <dig> promoter was found to be upregulated by either nfatc <dig> or mef2c, whereas cs- <dig> appears to be more resistant to this activation, indicating that these factors may also play a role in the transcriptional control of these genes. these findings also raised the possibility that calcineurin-nfat signalling pathway participates, at least partly, in the regulation of the calsarcin promoters. it is thought that no single regulatory pathway can dominate the regulation of each muscle-specific gene  <cit> , and it is considered likely that different pathways act cooperatively in the exclusive expression of a specific gene in slow or fast fibres. interestingly, an important signalling and functional link between the calcineurin-nfat and calcineurin-nf-κb pathways has been established by stable expression of constitutively active calcineurin in muscle c2c <dig> cells. this proposed model suggests dual actions for calcineurin upon terminal differentiation with opposing phenotypes, through its transient effects on nfat and prolonged effects on nf-κb, respectively  <cit> . studies of cs- <dig> knockout mice also demonstrate that cs- <dig> negatively modulates the functions of calcineurin and it will therefore be important to determine whether the transcription of the calsarcins is also subject to regulation by calcineurin signalling.

nf-κb has been implicated as a modulator of muscle catabolism and as a putative regulator of protein breakdown from existing fibres  <cit> . however, the complexities of the nf-κb signalling mechanisms in muscle are just now beginning to be elucidated. significantly also, disuse muscle atrophy is associated with the activation of the nf-κb pathway  <cit> , and disruption of the nf-κb <dig> gene inhibits skeletal muscle atrophy mainly in fast fibres  <cit> . the slow fibres in this case are atrophied to the same extent as their normal counterparts, indicating that there are different roles for nf-κb <dig> in slow and fast fibres during muscle atrophy  <cit> . in our current study, we have shown that the slow fibre specific cs- <dig>  but not fast fibre specific cs- <dig>  is a putative downstream target gene of nf-κb. other factors related to calcineurin, such as nfat and mef <dig>  were also found to participated in the regulation of these two gene promoters. in other words, the activation of this fibre-specific transcription appears to be mediated by a combinatorial mechanism involving different pathways and multiple factors. however, this mechanism was only tested in c2c <dig> myotubes in our present study, and whether further investigations will be needed in vivo. in addition, as it has also been speculated that the overexpression of a specific signalling factor may impact upon multiple muscle genes rather than just one targeted gene, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that the induced promoter activity is non-specific or is due to system effects of the enhanced pathways which were analysed. hence, whether this selective transactivation of calsarcins by nf-κb as well as other factors contributes to the atrophy discrepancies or the opposing phenotypes seen in slow and fast fibres needs further study.

CONCLUSIONS
our current results provide the first insights into the mechanisms regulating the transcription of members of the mouse calsarcin gene family, which are differentially expressed in slow- or fast-twitch muscle fibre cells. we have defined the proximal promoter region of both the cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> genes and further identified an nf-κb binding site in cs- <dig> core region, which contributes significantly to the transcriptional control of this gene. additionally, our data reveal that nf-κb has effects upon cs- <dig>  but not cs- <dig>  promoter function. in addition, the results of our overexpression analysis suggest that nfat and mef <dig> are also involved in the transcriptional regulation of these two genes. our data thus suggest that nf-κb plays an important role in the regulation of calsarcin expression and that different signalling pathways may cooperate with each other in a complex network of calsarcin transcriptional regulation. these findings provide some important clues that will enable further analysis of the role of calsarcin gene family in fibre-type specificity via calcineurin signalling.
