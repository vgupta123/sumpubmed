BACKGROUND
fine-tuning of gene expression has a central role in cellular adaptation allowing cells to thrive under different environmental challenges. a fundamental physiological challenge for the cell is to balance energy efficient growth and rapid response to environmental stress. regulation of gene transcription is a key control mechanism in the regulation of gene expression. emerging data reveal two distinct regulatory mechanisms that cells use to moderate transcription of stress-related and growth-related genes  <cit> . studies in the yeast s. cerevisiae have established a number of principles relevant to these global modes of regulation. growth-related and housekeeping genes tend to have promoters which lack a tata box and their transcriptional control is dominated by the tfiid complex. in contrast, stress-related genes generally contain tata boxes in their promoters and are predominantly regulated by the saga complex. stress-related genes are extensively regulated, prefer negative versus positive regulation by chromatin and possess higher plasticity of expression  <cit> . a genome-wide study of the structure and organization of eukaryotic pre-initiation complexes  demonstrated that there are also distinct functions of the + <dig> nucleosome at these two classes of genes  <cit> . nucleosomes and pics assemble cooperatively at tata-less/tfiid dependent promoters, in which case the + <dig> nucleosome is instructive for transcription start site  selection. in contrast, at tata-containing/saga dependent promoters nucleosomes and pics assemble competitively and this allows for greater stochasticity or plasticity of expression, wherein nucleosome loss primes the gene for a high level of transcription or vice versa  <cit> .

in yeast, taf <dig> is one of three yeats domain proteins which include yaf <dig> and sas <dig>  <cit> . while taf <dig> is a non-essential gene, disruption of taf <dig> causes sensitivity to temperature, osmolarity, and dna damaging agents such as uv light, gamma-irradiation, mms, 4nqo and hydroxyurea . taf <dig> is a subunit of several chromatin remodeling complexes, swi/snf, ino <dig> and rsc, the histone acetyltransferase nua <dig> and the general initiation factors, tfiid and tfiif . with the exception of swi/snf, taf <dig> has been shown to directly interact with the catalytic subunits of the remaining five complexes  <cit> . this distribution of taf <dig> among chromatin-modifying complexes and general transcription factors suggests an important role in the regulation of gene transcription. indeed, early studies showed that disruptions of the normally non-essential transcription elongation factor ppr <dig>  are lethal in conjunction with deletion of taf <dig>  <cit> . similarly dosage compensation of a gal <dig> deletion by gal <dig> requires an intact taf <dig>  <cit> . in s. pombe taf <dig>  was found to be required for stress responsive transcription  <cit>  while more recently rna-seq analyses of gene expression in a s. cerevisiae taf <dig> mutant identified a number of gene categories that are affected by taf <dig> mutation  <cit> .

the yeats domain is a conserved domain found in over  <dig> proteins across at least  <dig> distinct species  <cit> . the structure of the taf <dig> yeats domain indicates that it adopts a compact and rigid fold which may function as a scaffold in chromatin remodeling and transcription complexes  <cit> . studies on the human af <dig> yeats domain and the taf <dig> yeats domain show that it acts as an acetyl-lysine reader domain, showing a high preference for h3k9ac binding  <cit> . furthermore, disruption of the taf14-h3k9ac interaction was shown to impair transcription in vivo  <cit> . more recently, both taf <dig> and af <dig> yeats domains have been shown to recognize crotonylated histone h <dig>  <cit>  and in the case of af <dig> this interaction has been associated with active gene expression  <cit> .

in this report we analysed published genome-wide transcriptome and chip data to look at taf <dig> dependent effects on transcription and to discern the coregulatory factors that impact gene expression in combination with taf <dig>  we find that particularly for taf14-repressed genes multiple levels of regulation are apparent and suggest new interactions between taf <dig> and specific factors that negatively regulate gene transcription.

methods
data preparation
the raw data files from previously reported microarray analysis of wild type and taf14Δ strains  <cit>  have been downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database , accession number gse <dig>  raw cel files were quintile normalized using gcrma followed by baseline transformation to the median of all samples. the data was then filtered for expression values to exclude the genes that showed less than 20th percentile expression in all samples of at least one of the four conditions. a two-way anova for cell line and treatment was run and genes that passed significance analysis at a p-value < <dig>  after a benjamini hochberg false discovery rate correction were selected for further analysis. a twofold cut-off filter was then applied to select genes that showed differential expression. in the taf14Δ mutant,  <dig> genes showed increased expression  and  <dig> genes showed decreased expression  relative to the wild type strain .

we collected  <dig> gene expression profiles from  <dig> publications. the profiles were obtained for strains exposed to different non-standard growth conditions or strains mutated for various transcription factors. the complete list of publications and experiments is available in additional file 1: table s <dig>  data were downloaded from papers’ web supplements. in results “positively regulated” is defined as those genes that decrease the most  when the indicated factor is deleted; “negatively regulated” is defined as those genes that increase the most  when the indicated factor is either deleted or mutated as indicated. 10th percentile cutoff was also used for expression data for different stress conditions.

for occupancy and co-occupancy analysis data were obtained from  <cit> . occupancy values meeting a 5% fdr cutoff provided by authors were deemed to be significant and for increased and decreased occupancy upon heat-shock, top and bottom 10th percentile cutoff was used for comparisons.

the number of genes in each data set exceeds  <dig> 

data analysis
an unbiased set of genes or promoters is expected to have a distribution as observed throughout the entire genome. values significantly higher than the genome-wide distribution reflect a bias toward regulation by a distinct factor. with this type of analysis, data that are not relevant will show low significance, meaning that the distribution of an analysed property is very similar to the genome-wide average. p values, representing differences between genome-wide distributions and distributions in analysed samples, were calculated using the chitest formula in excel, converted to a log scale and the absolute value taken. negative signs are inserted where overlap was lower than that expected by chance. for clarity, any absolute value less than  <dig> was replaced with three periods.

RESULTS
genes negatively regulated by taf <dig> tend to be stress related, saga-dominated and contain a tata box
in the early stages of transcription the tata-binding protein  must be recruited to core promoters either by tfiid or saga complex  <cit> . a genome wide study revealed that 9–10% of all genes prefer saga complex for tbp recruitment to promoters, therefore an unbiased population is expected to have a distribution similar to this genome-wide average  <cit> . one of the first motifs described in a core promoter is the tata box, however later genome wide studies showed that the tata box is present in only 20% of all s. cerevisiae genes  <cit> . in additional file  <dig> we list the percentages of representation for all analysed properties in the genome as well as in the specified extracted gene sets. a genome wide study that compared these two traits, presence of tata box and preferance for either tfiid or saga for tbp recruitment, revealed that saga usually loads tbp on promotors of tata-containing genes, whereas tfiid is dominant among tata-less genes  <cit> . we found that genes that increased the most in a taf <dig> deletion strain were strongly biased toward being saga-dominated . strikingly, compared to 9–10% of saga-dominated genes present in an unbiased population, we find that among genes that were significantly induced in a taf <dig> deletion strain, 46% of those genes were previously described as saga-dominated . in accordance with the saga dependence of taf <dig> negatively regulated genes, we find that this group of genes also tend to contain a tata box . taf <dig> negatively regulated genes significantly overlap with a group of genes whose transcription is at low level during normal growth conditions  but interestingly tend to require rapid and variable regulation under inducing conditions . in addition, we find a significant overlap of taf <dig> negatively regulated genes with genes repressed by evolutionary pressure, suggesting that they are prone to fast evolution of gene expression control .table  <dig> significance values relating general genomic properties to taf <dig> regulated genesa

a number of previous studies identified a bimodal regulation of the transcriptome showing that expression of growth- and stress-related gene expression programmes utilize distinct sets of regulators  <cit> . in s. pombe taf <dig>  has been shown to be required for stress responsive gene transcription  <cit> . in addition, taf <dig> deletion strains have been shown to be sensitive to a variety of stressors . we therefore analyzed previously published large scale environmental stress data  <cit> , and found that genes that are commonly upregulated during stress, including heat, acidity, high osmolarity, dna damage, oxidation and carbon or nitrogen starvation were significantly represented in the group of genes negatively regulated by taf <dig> . among genes positively regulated by taf <dig> we find no significant overlap with stress-induced or repressed genes except in the case of mms dependent dna damage where we a find strong correlation of genes positively regulated by taf <dig> and genes induced during exposure to alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate  . the results show that many stress-responsive genes are negatively regulated by taf <dig> under normal growth conditions and that at least for the case of mms taf <dig> is required for both repression under normal conditions and induction of mms responsive genes upon exposure to mms . as there is no data for other stressors in strains lacking taf <dig> it remains to be determined whether this is a general property of taf <dig> under all stress conditions.table  <dig> significance values relating genomic properties to taf <dig> regulated genesa

heat shock leads to changes in the composition of the transcription machinery at a significant number of taf14-repressed promoters
genome-wide transcriptional studies in yeast reveal that within 15 min after exposure to heat shock, the cellular transcriptome undergoes substantial perturbations, involving transient repression of  <dig> genes and activation of  <dig> genes  <cit> . venters and coworkers determined the genome-wide binding locations of  <dig> transcription-related proteins under normal and acute heat-shock conditions  <cit> . we used these chromatin immunoprecipitation  data to analyse which regulators occupy promoters of taf14-impacted genes under normal conditions and also to determine the most common changes in composition of regulators found at these promoters upon heat shock. we found no significant changes in the composition of regulators after heat shock when we looked at taf14-induced genes. however, when we looked at taf14-repressed genes, we found as expected an over-representation of promoters with increased occupancy of pol ii and the general initiation factors, as well as decreased occupancy for the htz <dig> histone-repressive mark, all of which indicate increased expression among these genes after heat shock . we also found a significant overlap of taf14-repressed genes with promoters that showed the largest increase in occupancy of ino <dig>  nc <dig> and cyc8/tup <dig> .table  <dig> significance values relating whole genome occupancy changes in response to heat shock to set of genes repressed by taf <dig> under normal conditionsa



adetailed information with calculations and percentages are provided in additional file 3: sheet “other analyses”




we further analysed promoters that showed the highest change in taf <dig> occupancy upon heat shock . we found that genes with the highest increase of taf <dig> occupancy often contained a tata box and overlapped with genes induced during different stress conditions. whereas in the genome the representation of tata-containing promoters is approximately 20%, among genes with the highest increase in taf <dig> occupancy 34% are tata-containing genes . genes with the highest increase of taf <dig> occupancy tend to be positively regulated by saga complex and the stress-related activators msn2/ <dig> and negatively by ino <dig>  nc <dig> and srb <dig> kinase and mediator tail module. promoters with the largest decrease in taf <dig> occupancy  after heat shock generally show correlations that correspond to previously described tfiid-dominated genes  <cit> , meaning high transcription rate under standard conditions, dominance of tfiid  and overrepresentation of genes that are repressed under different stressful conditions .table  <dig> significance values relating genomic properties to promoters with significant taf <dig> occupancy change in response to heat shocka

in table  <dig> we show the correlations of promoters with significant changes in taf <dig> occupancy and different transcriptional regulators. when we looked at increased binding of components of the saga-regulatory pathway  <cit>  we mainly find correlations with promoters that show increased taf <dig> binding . a common regulatory role of taf <dig> and factors from the saga pathway on promoters of stress-related genes is further confirmed by the high overlap of their mutant transcription profiles . on the other hand, we found a correlation of promoters with decreased binding of taf <dig>  pol ii, tfiid and other general transcription factors  during a shift to 37 °c , due to a general transcription role of taf <dig> in transcription of growth related and housekeeping genes most likely through its association with tfiid and tfiif.table  <dig> significance values relating genomic properties to promoters with significant taf <dig> occupancy change in response to heat shocka

genes that are induced by taf <dig> disruption under normal conditions strongly overlap with genes that show increased taf <dig> occupancy upon heat shock . we analysed in detail this subpopulation of taf <dig> repressed promoters that also show a significant increase of taf <dig> occupancy in response to heat shock and find that most of the high significance values of properties from tables  <dig> to  <dig> are even more prominent in this filtered population of genes .

in order to further distinguish between general and specific regulatory roles of taf <dig> in genome-wide transcription, we analysed the location of taf <dig> before and after heat shock. table  <dig> shows that genes with decreased taf <dig> binding upon heat shock have taf <dig> primarily bound in the transcription start site  region prior to heat shock where the general transcription machinery usually binds  <cit> . however, genes with increased taf <dig> binding upon heat shock are primarily those that have taf <dig> bound to the upstream activating sequence  region after heat shock  where proteins of the saga stress-related pathway tend to reside  <cit> . when we examined taf14-repressed genes in the same manner we find that the only signficant correlation with taf <dig> occupancy is that of uas binding after heat shock .table  <dig> significance values relating whole genome taf <dig> binding location to set of promoters with distinct propertiesa

taf <dig> negatively regulated genes are highly regulated by nucleosomal- and tbp-targeted mechanisms
transcriptional regulators can be classified into three broad groups depending on whether they regulate chromatin, tbp or pol ii  <cit> . we examined transcriptional regulators belonging to each of these three groups to ascertain whether any displayed a preference to positively or negatively co-regulate transcription with taf <dig> 

we examined the two classes of taf14-dependent genes, either negatively or positively regulated, in order to identify whether they contain a greater content of genes impacted by a certain regulator than would be expected from the genome-wide distribution. in additional file 1: table s <dig> we list all genes found to be either negatively or positively regulated by taf <dig> with related functional categories and gene ontology.

taf <dig> has been found to be a subunit of three different atp-dependent chromatin remodeler complexes, ino <dig>  <cit> , swi/snf and rsc  <cit>  and we first examined the relationship of genes regulated by these remodelers to those regulated by taf <dig>  as expected, we found a very strong overlap of taf14-repressed genes with genes repressed by ino <dig> . we found a smaller but significant overlap with genes repressed by swi <dig> and no significant overlap with rsc <dig> repressed genes . although the role of chromatin remodelers in transcriptional activation is well known , our results point to a role in repression under non-inducing conditions as well, although the mechanism of this repression is unknown. as the majority of genes that we designated as taf <dig> or ino <dig> repressed are mostly stress related genes, we can only infer that perhaps taf <dig> or ino <dig> repression is significant in terms of a derepression mechanism for such promoters upon transfer to inducing conditions.table  <dig> significance values relating genomic properties to taf <dig> regulated genesa

histone amino termini can be modified post-translationally by acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation and crotonylation. these modifications affect histone charge and function. histone acetylation is one of the best described modifications and it is mainly associated with gene activity. one such example is the acetylation of h <dig> and h <dig> tails that is usually associated with transcriptional activation . histone deacetylases  hda <dig> and rpd <dig> are responsible for removal of acetyl tails from histone amino termini and individual deletions of these two enzymes lead to increase in histone acetylation of h <dig> and h <dig> and de-repression of a large number of genes  <cit> . a recent study showed that histone acetyl transferases  and hdacs regulate another dynamic mark of chromatin, histone crotonylation. these authors demonstrated that deletions of the major yeast hats or hdacs caused alterations in the h3k9cr levels that were even more substantial than alterations in the corresponding h3k9ac levels  <cit> . we compared taf14-impacted genes with the transcriptome profiles of both hda <dig> and rpd <dig> deacetylase mutants. genes that show the highest levels of derepression in the histone deacetylase mutants were significantly represented among genes negatively regulated by taf <dig> . however, we did not find a significant overlap of taf14-repressed genes with genes that were hyper-acetylated at h <dig> and h <dig> in the hda1Δ and rpd3Δ strains . this distinction between hda1-mediated deacetylation and hda1-mediated repression was previously described wherein it was found that deletion of hda <dig> always led to hyperacetylation but did not always lead to increased transcription of a particular gene  <cit> . it remains to be determined if overlap of taf14-repression with genes induced in hda1Δ and rpd3Δ strains correlates with increased crotonylation of histone h <dig> in these strains since a recent study described the yeats domain as currently the sole known reader of crotonyllysine  <cit> .

the cyc8-tup <dig> repressor complex is mainly affiliated with transcriptional repression and it was shown to interact with deacetylated histone h <dig> and h <dig> tails  <cit> . a recent study by wong and struhl showed that cyc8–tup <dig> complex is a general co-regulator of a class of stress-regulated, dna binding, repressor-activator proteins that are constitutively bound to their target sites. these authors showed that cyc8–tup <dig> complex does not act as a classical co-repressor, in fact it regulates transcription primarily by masking and inhibiting the transcriptional activation domains  <cit> . we therefore tested whether there is an overlap of taf14-repressed genes with those negatively regulated by cyc8-tup <dig> complex. genes displaying the highest level of repression by tup <dig> were significantly represented among taf14-repressed genes, compared to the genome-wide average . this correlation, together with the overlap of taf14Δ, ino80Δ and swi2Δ transcription profiles is interesting as a previous study showed that cyc8-tup <dig> blocks recruitment of nucleosome remodelers and therefore affects nucleosome composition of the promoter  <cit> . it has also been shown that tup <dig> repression blocks recruitment of the gal <dig> subunit of the mediator coactivator complex. interestingly, in addition to loss of the tup <dig> repressor, proper gal <dig> recruitment to target promoters also depends on histone h <dig> acetylation and eviction  <cit> . when we analysed the previously published transcriptome profile of a gal11Δmed3Δ strain, we found a very high overlap of genes induced in this mutant with a group of taf <dig> and ino <dig> repressed genes but no overlap with swi <dig> repressed genes . a previous study showed a similar functional interaction between gal <dig> and taf <dig> wherein suppression of a gal <dig> deletion mutant by high levels of gal <dig> required an active taf <dig> protein  <cit> . overlapping tup <dig>  gal <dig> and taf <dig> repression profiles as evidenced in this analysis suggest a strong link in the mechanism of repression by these three factors on a distinct set of stress responsive genes.table  <dig> significance of overlap for the sets of genes repressed by each regulator paira

nc <dig> and mot <dig> are two tbp regulators that have been implicated in the stress response and target many of the same genes  <cit> . nc <dig> consists of two subunits, bur <dig> and ncb <dig> and inhibits the recruitment of tfiia and tfiib to the promoter, most probably by binding to a tbp/promoter complex  <cit> . mot <dig> repression also targets tbp, in particular it dissociates tbp from dna by using the energy of atp hydrolysis to dissociate tbp from dna  <cit> . to address whether these two regulators have an overlapping regulatory role with taf <dig> we looked at those genes that were most impacted by bur6- <dig> and mot1∆ mutations. as indicated in table  <dig>  rows 11– <dig>  a set of genes that increased the most in bur6- <dig> and mot1∆ mutant strains displayed a strong overlap with genes induced in a taf14∆ mutant. in comparison to 6% of genes that are designated as negatively regulated by bur <dig> in the genome as a whole, among taf14-repressed genes we find that 37% of these genes are also bur6-repressed . we also find a strong correlation between bur <dig> and mot <dig> repressed genes with genes repressed by ino <dig>  tup <dig> and mediator tail  . these results are consistent with a previous study that connects nc <dig> regulation with the mediator tail module wherein it was shown that proper de-repression/activation of nc <dig> regulated genes was dependent on the presence of med <dig>  med <dig> and gal <dig> mediator subunits  <cit> .

srb <dig> is a kinase component of the mediator complex and many previous studies connect this factor to repression of different elements engaged in promoting a stress response. firstly, srb <dig> phosphorylates the c-terminal domain of pol ii which leads to transcription repression  <cit> . secondly, srb <dig> inactivates several transcription activators that promote a stress response. in this case phosphorylation leads to elimination of these transcriptional activators from the nucleus  <cit> . thirdly, several studies connected srb <dig> to repression by cyc8-tup <dig> repressor complex  <cit> . based on these previous studies and our results in this study linking taf <dig> and tup <dig> repression we next examined whether taf14-repressed genes show overlap with genes impacted by srb <dig> dysfunction. genes that are significantly repressed by srb <dig> showed a very high overlap with genes repressed by taf <dig> . moreover, we found that 44% of taf14-repressed genes were also induced in a srb10Δ mutant strain whereas across the whole genome only 6% are srb10-repressed. thus, we propose that srb <dig> as an important factor in the regulation of taf14-repressed genes . msn <dig> is one of the stress activators targeted by srb <dig> repression. therefore, we also examined genes regulated by the stress activators msn <dig> and msn <dig> and found a high degree of overlap between taf14-repressed genes and a set of genes positively regulated by msn2/ <dig> .

the combined results of these analyses support the hypothesis that taf <dig> is an important negative regulator in a coordinated stress response pathway  that is upregulated by the coactivator complex saga and stress activators such as msn2/ <dig> and downregulated by srb <dig>  histone deacetylases and tup1-dependent repression mechanisms.

taf <dig> co-occupies promoters with a distinct set of factors from cyc8-tup1-regulatory network
previous studies have described taf <dig> as a protein that physically associations with a number of multi-subunit transcriptional regulators including the general transcription factors tfiid and tfiif, the chromatin-modifying complexes swi/snf, ino <dig>  rsc and nua <dig> and the coactivator complex mediator . we next analysed previously published whole genome occupancy data for  <dig> transcription-related proteins  <cit>  in order to correlate taf <dig> co-occupancy at the genome-wide level. in table  <dig> we list the factors that show the highest statistical significance of overlap for the set of genes co-occupied by each regulator and taf <dig> . these factors show significant occupancy overlap with taf <dig> under both non-inducing and heat shock conditions. when we compare the binding locations with highest occupancy on each promoter we find that in addition to binding a similar set of promoters, these factors from the high overlap group tend to bind in close vicinity  to the taf <dig> binding location . the majority of these proteins have not been previously connected to taf <dig> either physically or functionally with the exception of taf <dig>  a subunit of tfiid, rvb <dig>  a subunit of ino <dig> complex and rsc <dig>  a subunit of the rsc complex. nevertheless, it is significant that these regulators are bound to similar promoters in the vicinity of taf <dig>  interestingly, four proteins from this high overlap group are associated directly or indirectly to transcriptional regulation via the cyc8-tup <dig> complex. three proteins, cti <dig>  rxt <dig> and ash <dig> are components of the rpd3l histone deactylase complex which is significant as cyc8-tup <dig> interacts with deacetylated histone h <dig> and h <dig> tails  <cit> . cti <dig> was also shown to relieve transcriptional repression by binding the cyc8-tup <dig> complex and recruiting saga to the repressed promoter  <cit> . the fourth transcription factor, skn <dig>  physically interacts with the cyc8-tup <dig> complex and recruits tup <dig> to its targets  <cit> . skn <dig> is a nuclear response regulator required for optimal induction of heat shock genes in response to oxidative stress. the correlation of taf14- and tup1-repressed gene sets  and co-occupancy data  clearly suggest a functional relationship between taf <dig> and the cyc8-tup <dig> regulatory pathways.table  <dig> significance values relating whole genome occupancy to set of genes occupied by taf14a

bonly proteins that show the highest statistical significance of overlap for the set of genes co-occupied by each regulator and taf <dig> are displayed, that is those with logp values greater than  <dig>  under both non-inducing and heat shock conditions




two proteins from the taf <dig> high overlap group were shown previously to regulate transcription elongation; rph <dig>  is a histone demethylase that associates with actively transcribed regions  <cit>  and hpr <dig>  a subunit of the tho/trex elongation complexes  <cit> . the co-occupancy of taf <dig> with these factors may be indicative of a complex role in transcription elongation as described in earlier studies .

discussion
taf <dig> is a member of the yeats domain superfamily and a subunit of multiple chromatin-modifying and transcription complexes  <cit> . genome-wide analysis of taf14Δ strains shows that distinct sets of genes can be either positively or negatively regulated by taf <dig>  <cit> , however the mechanistic aspects of this regulation are unknown. in this report we focused our analysis on genes that are negatively regulated by taf <dig> as this aspect of its function has not been reported on before.

we analysed the genome-wide impact of taf <dig> deletion and our results clearly show that taf14-repressed genes tend to be extensively regulated, in a positive manner by saga complex and stress-responsive activator proteins, and negatively by a number of repressors that act upon promoter chromatin and tbp. the correlation of taf14-dependent genes with those regulated by saga is further corroborated by the recent report of synthetic lethality when taf <dig> deletion is combined with a gcn <dig> mutation  <cit> . interestingly, even though taf <dig> is a subunit of tfiid, we did not find any correlations of taf14-dependent and tfiid-dependent genes under normal conditions. this is perhaps expected as taf <dig> is non-essential under normal conditions while the remaining tafs are essential genes. however, it remains possible that taf <dig> has an essential function within tfiid under some other condition which has yet to be tested.

a taf <dig> deletion strain is sensitive to multiple stressors including heat stress. our analysis of genome-wide occupancy of taf <dig> under non-inducing and heat-stress conditions showed that on a global level, under non-inducing conditions, taf <dig> is found predominantly at transcription start sites and upon heat stress a global relocalization occurs to predominantly uas sites. this suggests that in addition to a repressive role under non-inducing conditions, taf <dig> may be important for activation under stress conditions through its localization at uas sequences.

given the significant presence of taf14-repressed genes among those induced during various types of stress, and also the very strong overlap with negative regulation by srb <dig>  cyc8-tup <dig>  nc <dig>  mot <dig> and mediator tail module , we propose that taf <dig>  either through direct or indirect interaction with these factors keeps a distinct set of genes repressed under non-inducing conditions. surprisingly, with the exception of mediator, none of the aforementioned negative regulators has previously been implicated to interact with taf <dig> either physically or functionally. notably, we found that taf <dig> deletion led to de-repression of genes required for a variety of stress responses and yet the taf <dig> deletion strain remains sensitive to these stresses. this suggests that de-repression by simply removing taf <dig> is not sufficient to allow the deletion strain to grow in the presence of stressors and that the presence of taf <dig> may be required further for proper activation of stress responsive genes. we suggest that taf14-dependent repression is important for proper de-repression/activation under inducing conditions as reported above for the case of mms induction of dna-damage response genes . we also analyzed genome-wide chip data for occupancy of known transcription factors upon shift from normal to acute heat-shock conditions. our analysis of three different datasets shows that the described overlap of transcription profiles from distinct transcription factor deletion strains  is strongly accompanied by an overlap of their genome-wide occupancy . firstly, promoters of taf14-repressed genes strongly overlap with promoters that showed the largest increase in occupancy of ino <dig>  nc <dig> and cyc8/tup <dig> upon heat shock . secondly, promoters that showed the largest increase of taf <dig> occupancy upon heat shock are mostly promoters of genes that by many elements can be attributed to the saga-regulatory pathway . thirdly, upon heat shock taf <dig> tends to show increased binding to a similar set of promoters as do cyc8-tup <dig>  mediator and ino <dig> . in our survey of proteins that co-occupy a similar set of promoters as taf <dig> across the genome, we found a group of proteins that not only bind a highly similar set of promoters as taf <dig> but also tend to bind in close vicinity to the taf <dig> binding location . among these proteins at least three complexes, tfiid, ino <dig> and rsc, are known to have taf <dig> as a subunit. in addition four proteins, skn <dig>  cti <dig>  rxt <dig> and ash <dig> from the high overlap group belong to a group of factors that directly or indirectly regulate transcription via the cyc8-tup <dig> repressor complex which is consistent with our transcriptomic analysis showing co-regulation of taf14- and cyc8-tup1-repressed genes. thus, our combined data suggests a new and previously unrecognized interaction of taf14-dependent gene regulation and regulation via cyc8-tup <dig>  it remains to be examined whether this interaction is mediated by known complexes containing taf <dig> or whether taf <dig> acts alone or as part of a complex not previously associated with taf <dig> fig.  <dig> taf <dig> negatively regulated genes show distinct regulatory features. these genes are mostly stress-related, their promoters mainly contain a tata box and saga complex is mostly responsible for loading tbp to these promoters. transcription of these genes is also highly regulated by a distinct set of regulators. besides positive regulation by the stress related activator msn2/ <dig>  transcription regulation of taf <dig> repressed promoters is dominated by negative regulators of transcription. these include the negative co-regulators histone de-acetylases , tbp repressors mot <dig> and nc <dig> , cyc8-tup <dig> repressor complex, and two members of mediator complex, srb <dig> and the mediator tail module. repressing elements of transcription are illustrated in red and activating elements are in green




a recent study has shown that, among acetylated histone marks, the taf <dig> yeats domain preferentially binds the h3k9ac histone residue with no significant binding of unacetylated histones  <cit> . however, more recently the taf <dig> yeats domain has been identified as the first reader of histone h <dig> crotonyllysine  and it has been shown that h3k9cr is preferred over h3k9ac. these authors further demonstrated that h3k9cr exists in yeast and is dynamically regulated by hats and hdacs  <cit> . in this study we have shown an overlap of taf14-repressed genes with those genes that show the highest levels of derepression in the histone deacetylase mutants . thus rpd <dig> and hda <dig> are additional negative regulators of chromatin that correlate with transcriptional repression by taf <dig>  taf14-repressed genes do not appear to correlate with hyperacetylation in the hda <dig> and rpd <dig> dependent genes although it may be that a correlation with crotonylation remains to be examined.

previous reports have implicated the human yeats domain homolog af <dig> in regulation of transcription elongation  and thus it is interesting that two yeast proteins in the taf <dig> co-occupancy high overlap group, rph <dig> and hpr <dig>  are transcription elongation regulators. a connection between taf <dig> and regulation of transcription elongation was noted in previous studies, one showing that the absence of taf <dig> in the cell appears to create a dependence on an undefined function of eukaryotic transcription elongation factor tfiis, mediated by its n-terminal region  <cit>  and two more recent studies looking at a tfiif and tfiis connection in promoting transcript elongation by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . a question that remains is whether taf <dig> is involved in regulating dynamics of transcriptional elongation in yeast, similarly to af <dig> and enl , by recruiting different elongation-promoting factors to the rna pol ii elongation complex.

our genome-wide study describes a highly networked regulatory role of the yeats domain protein taf <dig>  considering the recently identified interactions of taf14’s yeats domain with acetylated and preferentially with crotonylated histone h <dig>  <cit> , an emerging model of taf <dig> action suggests it acts as a regulatory bridge between chromatin and the complexes that act upon it and that it may have a role in integration of signaling networks. the c-terminal of taf <dig> contains a conserved et-domain also found in af <dig> )  <cit> . the ahd domain is intrinsically disordered and has been shown to facilitate the dynamic exchange of high affinity interaction partners. the differing functions of the taf <dig> binding partners  <cit>  suggest that the role of its intrinsically disordered et domain, similarly to the ahd in the homologue af <dig>  <cit> , may be to promote exchange of these taf <dig> interacting factors subsequent to changes in their local concentration and/or affinity. given that the known histone modifications recognized by the taf <dig> yeats domain have not been associated with transcriptional repression it is unclear whether this type of mechanism also applies to taf14-dependent gene repression.

CONCLUSIONS
our analyses have shown that taf <dig> is an important negative regulator of stress-responsive gene transcription. our data and the work of others suggest that taf <dig> also plays a role in transcriptional activation of the stress response as well. taken together our analyses suggest a novel role for taf <dig> in repression and derepression of stress induced genes, most probably as part of a regulatory network which includes cyc8-tup <dig>  srb <dig> and histone modifying enzymes. this genome-wide survey of transcriptome and chip data has uncovered novel aspects of co-regulation of taf14-repressed genes and should inform future experimental studies that will mechanistically define taf14-dependent repression in regulating yeast gene transcription.
