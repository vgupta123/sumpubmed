BACKGROUND
during early embryogenesis, the shape of the vertebrate embryo changes dramatically, as the embryo narrows along the mediolateral axis and simultaneously lengthens along the anterior-posterior  axis. these morphological changes are brought about by cellular rearrangements, known as convergent extension  movements, that have been studied extensively in the frog and fish embryo . in the fish, ce in the mesoderm involves the convergence of lateral mesodermal cells dorsally by directed migration  <cit> . during mid-gastrulation and continuing into early segmentation, axial mesoderm cells  undergo mediolateral intercalation to extend the dorsal axis  <cit> . at a cellular level, directed migration is mediated by several types of cell behaviors that occur within distinct dorso-ventral domains  <cit> . axial cells undergoing intercalation at the dorsal midline become tightly packed and polarized along the mediolateral axis  <cit> . following gastrulation, the embryonic axis continues to elongate in the posterior  region. kanki and ho  identified four distinct stages of tailbud development: tailbud formation , tailbud extension , tailbud protrusion  and tail eversion . at a cellular level, the mechanisms of posterior body formation in vertebrates involve movements and behaviors that are similar to ce and others that are unique to the posterior body  <cit> .

ce movements are mediated, in part, by the non-canonical wnt signaling pathway, also known as the planar cell polarity  pathway, which was first identified in drosophila. in vertebrates this branched pathway is activated by the binding of wnt11/silberblick  and wnt5/pipetail  to their seven-transmembrane-domain receptor frizzled  and transduced through the multifunctional protein dishevelled . another gene in this pathway, knypek  is thought to potentiate wnt signaling  <cit> . other transducers of the non-canonical wnt pathway include: vang-like  <dig>   in the zebrafish), a transmembrane protein  <cit> ; prickle , an intracellular protein containing three lim domains and a conserved "pet" domain  <cit> ; rho kinase 2; and members of the rho family of small gtpases , that regulate different cellular responses such as cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell adhesion  <cit> . c-jun n-terminal kinase , although not specific to this pathway, is required downstream of small gtpases for ce  <cit> . consistent with their role in ce, vertebrate embryos in which genes in this pathway are either disrupted via mutation/use of dominant-negative constructs or overexpressed, typically exhibit shortened and broadened a-p axes .

there is increasing evidence that the cellular rearrangements that occur during ce also require the regulation of cadherin-based intercellular adhesion, as cells reposition themselves relative to one another  <cit> . the cadherins constitute a large superfamily that comprises classical cadherins, protocadherins and cadherin-like proteins such as flamingo . knockdown or overexpression of several members of this family have been shown to disrupt ce movements during gastrulation. zebrafish flamingo1a and b  are expressed in mesodermal cell populations undergoing gastrulation. morpholino  knockdown of these genes prevents the extension of the entire a-p axis, including the prechordal plate and ventral diencephalic precursors. fmi <dig> is thought to function in concert with non-canonical wnt signaling proteins in these mesodermal populations  <cit> , in agreement with the established role of drosophila fmi  as a pcp pathway component  <cit> . wnt <dig> was recently shown to recruit frizzled <dig>  and fmi to the plasma membrane, where the latter is thought to modulate local cell contact persistence in the zebrafish gastrula  <cit> . paraxial protocadherin , a member of the protocadherin subfamily expressed in the paraxial mesoderm of the gastrulating embryo, is required for dorsal convergence movements during gastrulation in the xenopus and zebrafish  <cit> . consistent with this observation, overexpression of papc rna triggers gastrulation movements in xenopus animal cap explants treated with low levels of activin  <cit> . xenopus papc was shown to signal through the small gtpases rhoa, rac <dig> and jnk, that also function downstream of the non-canonical wnt pathway. although papc is able to bind to the xenopus fz <dig> receptor and shares common downstream components with the non-canonical wnt signaling pathway, papc and wnt signaling are not redundant for mesodermal morphogenesis  <cit> .

in addition to members of the protocadherin subfamily, classical cadherins, including c-cadherin  and e-cadherin , are required for mesodermal morphogenesis. in the xenopus, c-cad is essential for gastrulation movements  <cit> . moreover, activin-induced axial elongation is accompanied by decreased c-cad-mediated cell-cell adhesion  <cit> , indicating that the levels of c-cad need to be tightly controlled for proper mesodermal morphogenesis. interestingly, papc, functioning downstream of activin and independently from non-canonical wnt signaling, was shown to downregulate the adhesive activity of c-cad in the paraxial mesoderm  <cit> . e-cad has also been implicated in gastrulation. following epiboly, zebrafish mesendodermal progenitors upregulate e-cad and become increasingly motile as they migrate along the overlying epiblast towards the animal pole and contribute to axis elongation. when e-cad function is compromised, mesendodermal progenitors fail to elongate and efficiently migrate along the epiblast  <cit> . evidence suggests that wnt <dig> controls the levels of e-cad on the cell surface and the general cohesiveness of mesendodermal progenitors by regulating e-cad endocytosis via the gtpase rab <dig>  <cit> , highlighting again the dynamic modulation of cell adhesion that accompanies morphogenesis. finally, it was recently demonstrated that a gradient of adhesive activity established downstream of bmp signaling by a classical cadherin, the identity of which is unknown, drives gastrulation movements in the zebrafish  <cit> . several members of the cadherin superfamily thus play a critical role in ce during gastrulation and some appear to interact with the non-canonical wnt pathway to mediate these movements.

in vertebrates, n-cadherin  expression is restricted to neural tissues, the notochord, somites, cardiac and skeletal muscle  <cit> . loss of n-cad function results in a variety of neural tube defects in vertebrate embryos  <cit> . in contrast to its well-characterized role in the neural tube, there is little evidence that n-cad is required for the morphogenetic events that shape the embryonic axis during gastrulation or post-gastrulation stages. in the mouse and zebrafish, only late mesodermal defects associated with the formation of somites  <cit>  or cardiac muscle  <cit>  have been reported in n-cad null embryos. we demonstrate here using a semi-dominant n-cad allele that n-cad, and possibly other members of the classical cadherin subfamily, are essential for tailbud eversion and to a lesser extent for shaping the mesoderm during gastrulation. supporting these observations, zebrafish n-cad is expressed in axial and paraxial mesoderm during gastrulation and throughout the tailbud. in addition, we show that n-cad interacts genetically with vangl <dig>  a member of the non-canonical wnt signaling pathway, to mediate tailbud eversion. we further rule out a role for n-cad in regulating apoptosis during the onset of tailbud eversion. together these data point to a central role for cadherins in mediating the cellular behaviors that drive the elongation of the posterior body.

RESULTS
n-cadherin mutants display a range of tail phenotypes
fifteen n-cad mutant alleles have so far been generated in forward genetics screens in the zebrafish  <cit> , suggesting that this locus is a hot spot for mutation. the most striking phenotype in these mutants is the abnormal brain and eye morphology. however, tail defects with varying degrees of severity have also been reported for several n-cad alleles. the tail is curved in n-cadp79emcf homozygous mutants that harbor a missense mutation in the ec <dig> domain . the tail of predicted n-cad null mutants that carry truncations upstream of the transmembrane domain  or that fail to properly splice the n-cad transcript . surprisingly, the most pronounced posterior phenotype is observed in the n-cadm <dig> homozygous mutant  that contains a substitution of the tryptophan  <dig> , the second amino acid at the n-terminus of the cadherin, by glycine  <cit> . there is now considerable evidence that classical cadherin-mediated cell adhesion requires a strand exchange process in which trp <dig> docks into a hydrophobic pocket in the opposing cadherin and anchors the strand-swap interface  <cit> . the n-cadm <dig> mutation may therefore block n-cad-mediated cell-cell adhesion by either preventing the strand exchange or, more likely, by preventing the anchoring of the strand-swap interface. n-cadm <dig> mutants have undefined somitic boundaries by  <dig> hours post-fertilization  and a characteristic club-shaped, shortened tail that appears to be filled with vacuoles by  <dig> hpf . sections through the tail region of these mutants or wild type  embryos injected with n-cad mo revealed a "t"-shaped neural tube, previously ascribed to impaired neurulation . transheterozygotes for the n-cadp79emcf and n-cadm <dig> alleles  exhibit a phenotype intermediate between homozygous embryos for either allele , indicating that the defects observed in n-cadm <dig> mutants are caused, at least in part, by misregulation/alteration of n-cad function.

n-cadm <dig> may block the adhesive activity of other classical cadherins
the posterior defects observed in n-cadm <dig> mutants suggest that n-cad is required for posterior morphogenesis. however, given the more subtle posterior defects observed in presumed n-cad null mutants , it is also possible that n-cadm <dig> is a gain of function allele, increasing rather than reducing the adhesive activity of n-cad . this possibility seems unlikely given the essential nature of the trp <dig> residue in mediating adhesion  <cit>  and the cell adhesion defects described below. alternatively, n-cadm <dig> may alter the activity of other classical cadherins in a dominant or a semi-dominant negative manner. consistent with this hypothesis, members of this subfamily are known to interact in trans in both a homophilic and a heterophilic manner  <cit> . moreover, several zebrafish classical cadherins, including n-, e- and m-cadherin, are expressed in the mesoderm during embryogenesis  <cit> .

if n-cadm <dig> is a dominant or semi-dominant allele, a simple prediction is that n-cadm117/+ heterozygote embryos should display a phenotype. to address this possibility, wt fish were outcrossed to n-cadm117/+ heterozygotes and the length of the tail of their offspring, half of which should be n-cadm117/+, was measured at  <dig> hpf. these measurements did not reveal a bimodal distribution , but rather, a full overlap with measurements taken from a cross between wt fish, indicating that the presence of this allele in a heterozygous configuration may not be sufficient to cause a posterior phenotype. to further explore the possibility that the n-cadm <dig> is dominant or semi-dominant, we scored the offspring from a cross between two heterozygotes for the presence of neural convergence defects at  <dig> somites , as it has been previously reported that neurulation is impaired in n-cad mutants  <cit> . at 6– <dig> som, n-cadm <dig> homozygous mutants are readily identifiable, based on the neural tube defects and the lack of somitic boundaries  <cit> . cross sections through the head region of these embryos revealed a keel-shaped neural tube , indicative of impaired neural convergence, whereas wt embryos at this stage have a neural rod . interestingly, two out of three "non-mutant siblings" from this cross, had neural convergence defects , in contrast to the third embryo that had a rod-shaped neural tube . such defects have not been observed in n-cadp79emcf or n-cadr <dig>  heterozygotes . the simplest interpretation of these observations is that n-cadm117/+heterozygotes have mild neurulation defects. thus, the n-cadm <dig> allele appears to be semi-dominant, at least with regards to neural convergence.

to further investigate the reason underlying the difference in severity of the posterior defects in n-cad mutants, we also examined n-cad protein expression and localization in several n-cad mutants. interestingly, n-cad protein was mislocalized away from the plasma membrane in n-cadp79emcf mutants , that harbor a point mutation in the ec <dig> domain  <cit> . this finding was confirmed using an antibody against β-catenin, a protein that associates with the cytoplasmic domain of n-cad . consistent with previously published observations, no n-cad protein was detected in n-cadr <dig>  homozygous mutants . in contrast, normal or slightly elevated levels of n-cad protein were observed in n-cadm <dig> mutants  and in putative n-cadm <dig> heterozygotes . together these observations suggest that n-cadp79emcfmay function as a null allele, explaining why the phenotype of n-cadp79emcf mutants is very similar to that of n-cadr <dig>  mutants. furthermore, the presence of n-cad protein in n-cadm <dig> heterozygotes and homozygotes is consistent with this allele being semi-dominant and altering the adhesive activity of other cadherins by heterophilic interactions.

in summary, loss of n-cad and other classical cadherin function impairs posterior mesoderm morphogenesis and somite boundary formation, in addition to neural convergence. moreover, the fact that severe brain but only mild posterior defects are observed in embryos carrying n-cad null alleles  suggests that brain development is mostly dependent on n-cad function whereas tail developmental may require several cadherin family members with overlapping functions. since n-cadm117/n-cadp79emcf transheterozygotes have an intermediate phenotype, as compared to their homozygous mutant counterparts, this indicates that n-cad does participate in posterior morphogenesis. we focus the rest of this study on the posterior defects.

loss of cadherin function blocks tail elongation
the tail defects observed at  <dig> hpf in n-cad loss of function embryos may be indicative of a role for n-cad and other cadherins in shaping the mesoderm during gastrulation or in driving the cell behaviors that mediate tailbud growth during late somitogenesis. in order to address these possibilities, n-cadm <dig> mutants were examined at earlier stages of development for morphological defects typically associated with impaired gastrulation or/and tailbud elongation. morphologically,n-cadm <dig> mutants are first identifiable at 2– <dig> som, based on their neural keel phenotype  <cit> . however, at this stage of development, the length of the a-p axis appeared normal, even though somitic boundaries were undefined . embryos examined at later stages, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> som, also looked normal with respect to the length of their a-p axis . however, axial defects became apparent by  <dig> som  and were more pronounced by  <dig> som and continuing into later stages . these observations are consistent with a requirement for n-cad in tailbud eversion, a late stage in tailbud growth, when the tailbud moves away from the yolk cell  <cit> .

in order to determine whether loss of cadherin function may cause subtle defects in ce movements during gastrulation that were not detectable using morphological criteria, embryos were further analyzed using molecular markers for ectodermal and mesodermal tissues. the extent of axial mesoderm ce was examined at the  <dig> som stage, using a no tail riboprobe to label the axial mesoderm. n-cadm <dig> mutant embryos were readily identifiable at this stage of development by co-labeling with dlx <dig>  a marker for the edge of the neural plate. indeed, a quarter of the embryos from a cross between n-cadm <dig> heterozygous parents revealed an enlarged neural plate , caused by impaired ce in the neural ectoderm. this phenotype is consistent with the expression of n-cad in the neural plate and the known role of n-cad in neural convergence  <cit> . the width of the notochord in n-cadm <dig> mutant embryos was comparable to that of wt siblings . to test for paraxial mesoderm convergence defects,  <dig> som stage embryos were examined using papc and myod, markers for presomitic paraxial mesoderm and somites, respectively. presomitic mesoderm appeared laterally expanded in n-cadm <dig> homozygous mutants  but not in n-cadm <dig> heterozygotes . these results suggest that loss of cadherin function can cause mild mesodermal convergence defects and confirm that the n-cadm117allele is not fully dominant. consistent with the enlarged papc domain, somites were slightly wider in n-cadm <dig> mutants than in wt siblings . these phenotypes are similar to, although less pronounced than, those observed in non-canonical wnt signaling mutants, such as kny and trilobite . in addition to the lengthening of the somites, myod-positive cells were observed in ectopic positions in n-cadm <dig> mutants , suggesting a loss of cell-cell adhesion. this mixing of mesodermal populations was previously observed in embryos in which papc is disrupted  <cit> . dorsal views of  <dig> som n-cadm <dig> mutants imaged using nomarski optics also revealed the presence of scattered, disorganized cells adjacent to a poorly defined notochord and throughout the tailbud, confirming a loss of tissue integrity in the paraxial mesoderm of n-cadm <dig> mutants .

together, these observations suggest that the cell intercalation behaviors that drive the narrowing and elongation of the dorsal axis  during gastrulation are normal in absence/reduced function of n-cad and other cadherin family members, but the convergence movements in paraxial mesoderm may be slightly defective. in addition, the tailbud fails to undergo proper eversion in n-cadm <dig> mutants, which most likely accounts for the severe posterior shortening observed in older embryos. this defect may be caused by impaired intercellular adhesion. given that neural and mesodermal markers are expressed in a regionally appropriate manner in these embryos , cell fate specification is unlikely to be a contributing cause to the posterior defect.

n-cadherin is expressed in the mesoderm during gastrulation and post-gastrulation stages
to determine whether the expression pattern of n-cad is consistent with a role in mesodermal morphogenesis, in situ hybridization was carried out on embryos at different stages of development. a previous report indicated that n-cad is not expressed maternally  <cit> , therefore n-cad expression was analyzed beginning at gastrula stages. at the shield stage , n-cad rna is fairly ubiquitous, with higher levels in the dorsal region of the embryo . the dorsal forerunner cells  express particularly high levels of n-cad at this stage . as gastrulation proceeds , expression is enhanced in prospective neural tissue and axial mesoderm  and turned off in the ventral  ectoderm .

by mid-somitogenesis, n-cad is present ubiquitously in neural tissue with highest levels in the anterior neural rod . expression in the presomitic  and paraxial mesoderm  is prominent in the trunk region. in the tailbud, n-cad expression is observed throughout the prospective neural tissue and mesoderm but is conspicuously absent from the epidermis and enveloping layer . by late somitogenesis , during tailbud protrusion, n-cad expression is very high in anterior neural tissue , while trunk and tail neural tissue have lower levels . trunk somites express n-cad in postmigratory slow cells  while the tail somites express n-cad throughout, as previously described by cortes et al.,  <dig> <cit>   .

increased apoptosis does not contribute to the onset of posterior defects
the expression of n-cad throughout the tailbud is consistent with a role for n-cad in mediating the cell behaviors that contribute to tail eversion. however, it is also possible that increased cell death accounts for the posterior defects in n-cadm <dig> mutants. to investigate this possibility, apoptosis in the tailbud was scored by counting the number of tunel-positive cells in the tail region . staining was performed at the 18– <dig> som stage , at the 22– <dig> som stage and at  <dig> hpf. at 18– <dig> som, a slight increase in apoptosis was observed in n-cadm <dig> mutants compared to wt siblings, however the increase was too low to account for the severity of the tail defects at this stage. moreover, the number of apoptotic cells at 22– <dig> som was similar between n-cadm <dig> mutants and wt embryos. in contrast, a dramatic increase in cell death was observed at  <dig> hpf in n-cadm <dig> mutants relative to wt . these results indicate that increased apoptosis is unlikely to contribute to the tailbud eversion defect at early stages  but may contribute significantly in shortening the posterior axis of older embryos .

impaired movement of posterior axial mesodermal cells underlies the tailbud elongation defects
zebrafish n-cad is known to drive the convergence of neural cells  <cit>  and other zebrafish classical cadherins have been implicated in mesodermal morphogenesis . it is therefore likely that n-cad and other members of the cadherin family also participate in the cell movements implicated in posterior body elongation. the tailbud is derived from two cell populations, posterior tailbud cells  and anterior tailbud cells  to avoid the midline  <cit> . in order to test whether the movement of posterior tailbud cells was impaired in n-cadm <dig> mutants, cells immediately posterior to kupffer's vesicle  were labeled at the  <dig> to  <dig> som stage  and the position of their progeny scored at the  <dig> som stage . labeling in wt siblings revealed either single or double rows of cells adjacent to the dorsal midline, indicating that cells underwent laterad divergence and adopted a paraxial mesoderm fate, as previously reported . labeled cells in n-cadm <dig> mutants also appeared to move anteriorly , avoiding the midline . however, unlike wt cells, they did not organize into rows but rather, were scattered medio-laterally . these findings suggest that cadherin-mediated adhesion may not be required for cell behaviors of the posterior tailbud, but are necessary to maintain the general cohesiveness of this tissue.

anterior tailbud cells are thought to extend into the tail by cell rearrangement and intercalation  and by enlargement of notochord cells due to vacuolation. to investigate whether posterior extension of the axial mesoderm is defective, cells immediately anterior to kv were labeled at  <dig> som  and the position of their progeny scored at the  <dig> som stage . labeling of wt siblings revealed that cells aligned along the posterior midline and adopted a cuboidal morphology characteristic of notochord cells . in contrast, labeled cells in n-cadm <dig> mutants were observed in ectopic positions, which mostly coincided with the location of large vacuoles in the tail tip. cells were found associated with the dorsal region of the tailbud , adjacent to the yolk extension  or within the vacuoles . in addition, labeled cells failed to adopt the characteristic cuboidal morphology . thus, cadherins appear to be necessary for the proper positioning of axial mesoderm cells. it is likely that loss of tissue integrity in the tailbud region, as evidenced by the scattering of cells , may be the underlying reason for this defect. indeed, cell-cell adhesion is known to be essential for cell intercalation movements such as those that drive notochord elongation .

in situ hybridization on wholemount  <dig> hpf n-cadm <dig> mutants using myod  and no tail  confirmed the uncaging data. myod was expressed throughout the posterior region , indicating that ventral-derived cells were able to populate the posterior region. in contrast, no tail expression was not observed in the tail tip , supporting the finding that axial mesoderm does not extend posteriorly in n-cadm <dig> mutants.

n-cadherin and vang-like  <dig> interact to regulate posterior body morphogenesis
n-cadm <dig> mutants have a phenotype that is similar although not identical to non-canonical wnt signaling mutants such as tri, kny and ppt, which exhibit shortened a-p axes by early segmentation stages  <cit> . this raises the possibility that classical cadherins and non-canonical wnt signaling components have a partially redundant function. a potential interaction between n-cad and vangl <dig> was investigated by combining n-cadp79emcf, an n-cad allele that displays a very mild tail phenotype, , with a low dosage of vangl <dig> mo. titration of vangl <dig> mo was undertaken to identify a mo concentration at which ce movements were near normal in injected embryos, when assayed at  <dig> hpf . the optimal amount was found to be  <dig>  ng, as this is the lowest dosage at which an interaction with n-cadp79emcf was observed. since injections were done when mutant embryos could not be identified, genotyping was retroactively carried out at  <dig> hpf. interestingly, n-cadp79emcf homozygous mutants injected with the predefined low dosage of vangl <dig> mo  had dramatically shortened tails  relative to controls , wt injected with vangl <dig> , uninjected n-cadp79emcf mutants , and n-cadp79emcf wt siblings injected with vangl <dig> mo . the general morphology of n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos appeared superficially similar to that of n-cadm <dig> mutants. however, upon closer examination, the phenotypes were not identical as somites formed properly in the trunk region of n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos and their tails had less vacuoles than n-cadm <dig> mutants .

to address how early the n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo tail phenotype becomes apparent, embryos were examined at  <dig> and  <dig> som. while no axial elongation defects were present at  <dig> som , n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos had severely shortened tails by  <dig> som . consistent with a late onset phenotype, n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos labeled at  <dig> som with dlx <dig> and ntl  did not exhibit a wider neural plate or notochord, relative to wt injected with vangl <dig> mo . papc labeling of  <dig> som n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos revealed a slightly expanded paraxial mesoderm domain  relative to controls , however this phenotype was not more severe than the combined defects observed in wt embryos injected with vangl <dig> mo  and n-cadp79emcf mutants . likewise, myod labeling at  <dig> som failed to detect a significant lengthening of the somites in n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos  relative to wt embryos injected with vangl <dig> mo . it is also noteworthy that n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos do not exhibit ectopic myod-positive cells, in contrast to n-cadm <dig> mutants .

together these observations suggest that n-cad and vangl <dig> interact genetically and that this interaction is primarily required, during post-gastrula stages, for tailbud eversion. increased apoptosis in posterior regions was ruled out as a likely contributing factor to tail shortening, as the number of apoptotic cells at 18– <dig> som and 22– <dig> somites in n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos was roughly equivalent to that observed in controls . these findings suggest that impaired cell movements cause the posterior defects. moreover, the fact that the phenotypes observed in n-cadm <dig> mutants and n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos are qualitatively different suggests that n-cad and vangl <dig> may not interact to regulate cell-cell adhesion.

n-cadherin and vang-like  <dig> are likely to function in parallel pathways
the genetic interaction between n-cad and vangl <dig> is a priori consistent with these genes functioning either in linear or parallel pathways. to distinguish between these two possibilities, the ability of the vangl <dig> mo to worsen the n-cadm <dig> null phenotype was tested. if these genes function in a linear pathway exclusively, then vangl <dig> mo should have little or no effect on n-cadm <dig> mutants. vangl <dig> mo was injected at the same low concentration used in combination with the n-cadp79emcf allele . 100%  of the n-cadm <dig> mutants injected with this dosage of vangl <dig> mo had enhanced tail defects at  <dig> hpf  relative to uninjected n-cadm <dig> mutants , suggesting that n-cad and vangl <dig> function synergistically and in parallel pathways to regulate ce.

it has recently been reported that wnt <dig> controls the general cohesiveness of mesendodermal progenitors, by regulating e-cad endocytosis  <cit> , indicating that, in some cases, classical cadherins function downstream of the non-canonical wnt pathway. to further address whether the relation between vangl <dig> and n-cad is strictly non-linear, n-cad levels and localization were analyzed in two planar cell polarity mutants, tri and kny. cross sections through the tail region of  <dig> som embryos did not reveal any overt differences in n-cad labeling between wt and mutants . these findings are consistent with n-cad and the planar cell polarity pathway functioning synergistically and in parallel to regulate posterior morphogenesis.

discussion
role of n-cadherin in posterior mesoderm and neural tube morphogenesis
several pieces of evidence point to a primary role of n-cad and possibly other cadherins in regulating posterior mesoderm morphogenesis. firstly, the length of the a-p axis in n-cadm <dig> mutants appears normal until  <dig> som, which coincides with the onset of tailbud eversion  <cit> . in contrast, embryos in which members of the non-canonical wnt signaling pathway such as vangl <dig> and kny have been disrupted, show a dramatic shortening of the axis beginning at mid-somitogenesis stages  <cit> . the early onset of a-p defects in these mutants reflects the role of vangl <dig> and kny in mesodermal morphogenesis during gastrulation. secondly, molecular markers only show a slight impairment in paraxial mesodermal convergence during gastrulation in n-cadm <dig> mutants. thirdly, in vivo labeling of targeted cell populations in the tailbud revealed that while the anteriorward movement of ventral-derived cells  appears normal, dorsal-derived cells  are unable to extend posteriorly. this finding is surprising given the widespread expression of n-cad throughout the tailbud region. however, several lines of evidence indicate that cadherins are essential for cell intercalation behaviors underlying notochord extension , but may not be required for directed migration of cells, a process that is thought to mostly rely on cell-extracellular matrix interactions mediated by integrins. the extension of the notochord along the yolk ball via cell intercalation is thought to be a contributing force for posterior tail extension  <cit>  and may therefore explain, at least in part, the tail defects observed in n-cadm <dig> mutants.

the data presented in this paper has focused on n-cad's role in the mesoderm, as ce in this germ layer is thought to account for most of the elongation of the a-p axis. however, n-cad is also required for the morphogenesis of the neural tube . fate mapping studies have shown that the posterior spinal cord derives from dorsal cells in the epiblast of the anterior tailbud. these precursor cells are thought to become distributed along the entire length of the developing tail by ce-like movements and cell proliferation  <cit> . the nt in posterior regions of n-cadm <dig> mutants and wt embryos injected with high levels of n-cad mo is not only shortened but also has a characteristic "t" shape, indicative of impaired nt closure  <cit> . thus, in addition to shaping the mesoderm, n-cad is also required for proper posterior nt morphogenesis, consistent with its broad expression throughout the tailbud.

why is the n-cadm <dig> phenotype stronger than that of presumed null mutants?
several n-cad null alleles have been previously described in the zebrafish  <cit> . embryos homozygous for these null alleles exhibit mild posterior defects. we have further characterized another potential null allele, n-cadp79emcf, that carries a point mutation in the ec <dig> domain  <cit> . immunofluorescence studies revealed that the n-cad protein is mislocalized away from the plasma membrane in these mutants. this may be potentially explained by a misfolding of the protein, such that it is not able to properly insert into the membrane. accordingly, the phenotype of n-cadp79emcf homozygous mutants is very similar to that of confirmed n-cad null mutants. it is possible that the tail curvature defect observed in these embryos may be caused by impaired neurulation but normal mesodermal ce. with stronger n-cad alleles , impaired mesodermal morphogenesis may alleviate this curvature defect while causing a shortened axis.

n-cadm <dig> mutants have a severe posterior defect that is not observed in n-cad null mutants. we propose that this allele is semi-dominant, as mild neural convergence defects were observed in heterozygous siblings. since n-cad is known to interact heterophilically with other members of the classical cadherin family  <cit> , n-cadm <dig> may affect the adhesive activity of these proteins. alternatively, n-cadm <dig> may impair the function of other n-cad paralogues, recently identified following sequencing of the zebrafish genome.

n-cadherin may function as an adhesion or a signaling molecule
at a molecular level, how could n-cad function to promote cellular rearrangement? as a member of the classical cadherin subfamily, n-cad is known to mediate cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . morphogenetic movements such as those that occur during ce require a dynamic regulation of adhesion, as contacts between cells have to be constantly broken and re-established in order for cells to exchange neighbors and locally reposition themselves  <cit> . in this context, the adhesive activity of c-cad is known to play a critical role during xenopus gastrulation  <cit> . it was recently shown that c-cad's adhesive activity is regulated by papc, functioning downstream of activin and independently from non-canonical wnt signaling  <cit> . this raises the intriguing possibility that a similar relationship exists between n-cad and papc in the paraxial mesoderm and may be required for proper mesodermal morphogenesis. there is also strong evidence that classical cadherins can function as signaling molecules . for example, axonal outgrowth in retinal ganglion cells is dependent on the interaction between n-cad and the fgf receptor   <cit> . the invasive activity of n-cad during cancer metastasis also results from a functional interaction with fgfr at the cell surface  <cit> . other signaling molecules through which cadherins can function to stimulate cell motility is the rho family of small gtpases, the steady state activation of which increases in the presence of n-cad  <cit>  and retinal cadherin -mediated cell-cell contact  <cit> . activation of these gtpases correlates with increased cell motility  <cit> .

thus, experimental data strongly supports a role for n-cad in both adhesion and signaling. further elucidation of the role of n-cad and other cadherins in promoting posterior morphogenesis will require assays to distinguish between these two functions.

interaction between n-cadherin and the non-canonical wnt signaling pathway
a genetic interaction between n-cad and vangl <dig>  was demonstrated by slightly lowering the levels of vangl <dig> in embryos carrying the n-cadp79emcf allele. n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos exhibited a dramatically shortened tail, similar to that observed in n-cadm <dig> mutants. n-cad and vangl <dig> were interpreted to function synergistically and in parallel pathways, as lowering the levels of vangl <dig> in n-cadm <dig> mutants worsened the tail defect in these embryos even further and n-cad levels and localization were not perturbed in tri and kny mutants. these findings suggest that there are other pathways regulating the distribution of n-cad protein in cells undergoing movement. moreover, the similar yet distinct phenotype of n-cadm <dig> mutants and n-cadp79emcf; vangl <dig> mo embryos suggests that n-cad and vangl <dig> may not interact to regulate intercellular adhesion but rather some other cell behavior.

there is increasing evidence that regulation of cell adhesion plays a central role during gastrulation . data presented in this paper complements these findings by demonstrating that the role of cadherins extends beyond gastrulation, to orchestrate posterior body formation.

CONCLUSIONS
formation of the vertebrate tail involves a continuation of gastrulation-type movements that shape the head and trunk region and posterior-specific behaviors  <cit> . while the cadherin superfamily has a well established role in mediating mesodermal morphogenesis during gastrulation, less is known about the function of cadherins in lengthening the posterior body region. we provide here several pieces of evidence that n-cad and other members of the classical cadherin subfamily are essential for eversion of the tailbud and to a lesser extent for shaping the mesoderm during gastrulation. consistent with these observations, zebrafish n-cad is expressed in axial and paraxial mesoderm during gastrulation and throughout the tailbud. moreover, n-cad appears to interact synergistically with vangl <dig>  a member of the non-canonical wnt signaling pathway to mediate tailbud eversion. together these findings further highlight the central role of members of the cadherin superfamily in the cell behaviors that shape the vertebrate embryo.
