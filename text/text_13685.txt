BACKGROUND
the domestication of crop species started  <dig>  to  <dig>  years before present by gradual selection of desirable traits and of adaptations to agricultural environments  <cit> . such artificial selection of individual plants with desirable traits, e.g., high yield, large fruits, loss of shattering seeds, etc., had an artificial selection effect which resulted in genetic differences between crops and their wild ancestors, both in coding and neutral regions of the genome. however, the long co-existence of crops alongside their wild relatives provided opportunities for hybridization, leading to gene flow between the diverging gene pools. gene flow between cultivated plants and their wild ancestors has been demonstrated in woody species cultivated for their edible fruits such as almonds   <cit> , grapes   <cit>  and apples   <cit> . in addition to gene flow, dispersal of seeds from cultivated trees into natural surroundings can result in feral populations of natural aspect  <cit> , as shown for several plants introduced to australia, including olea europaea  <cit> . both these processes can result in substantial difficulties when trying to identify populations as truly wild.

it is generally accepted that the cultivated olive olea europaea subsp. europaea var. europaea originated from wild var. sylvestris  lehr by artificial selection from wild populations  <cit> . recently, analysis of plastid dna diversity among  <dig>  supposedly wild olive trees from  <dig> localities across the mediterranean area and  <dig> cultivars suggested that the north levant  was the primary domestication centre of olives  <cit> . however, one of the earliest indications of the use of olives and possibly also of its cultivation was found in the southeastern mediterranean area  and dated to  <dig>  b.c.  <cit> .

wild var. sylvestris, often called ‘oleaster’, resembles cultivated olives except for its shrubby growth and smaller leaves and fruits  <cit> . these characters, however, are highly variable and do not allow reliable distinction between the wild and cultivated varieties. thus, the identification of olives growing in natural surroundings in the southeast mediterranean area as var. sylvestris is often questionable  <cit> . however, using an ecological niche model based on current climatic parameters, besnard et al.  <cit>  could identify the natural distribution range of var. sylvestris and could show that current conditions are suitable for its presence in the southwest levant, i.e., modern israel.

studies employing different molecular marker techniques to investigate the relationship between cultivated and wild olives and to map the distribution of wild olives in the mediterranean area have been conducted before, e.g. . in several cases, genetic similarity between trees growing in natural surroundings and cultivated olives was interpreted as evidence for the feral nature  of the former  <cit> . however, the studies by baldoni et al.  <cit>  and belaj et al.  <cit>  also revealed the existence of genetically distinct populations in italy and spain, respectively, which were interpreted as evidence for the continued existence of isolated populations of wild var. sylvestris in the mediterranean area. supporting this hypothesis, other studies using dna  and allozyme  <cit>  variation differentiated between cultivated and wild forms of olives. more recently, a comprehensive bayesian analysis of microsatellite variation that included cultivated and supposedly wild trees from around the mediterranean basin showed that wild trees from the southeastern mediterranean region were genetically closely similar to spanish cultivars  <cit> . the study by diez et al.  <cit>  as well as others  <cit>  thus suggest that the identification of naturally growing populations of olives as var. sylvestris requires caution in view of the possibility of gene flow between cultivated and wild populations.

in israel, naturally growing populations of olive trees can be found in the mediterranean maquis and garrigues of the carmel and western galilee mountain ranges. considering that it is likely that olives have been cultivated continuously in the area for at least  <dig>  years , and that olive groves occupy large parts of the rural landscape, the continued existence of populations of var. sylvestris in the region perhaps is not likely and needs to be studied. several studies included samples of naturally growing olive trees from the southeastern mediterranean to infer the distribution and genetic diversity among population of ‘oleaster’ around the mediterranean  <cit> . higher genetic diversity was found in populations of naturally growing olive trees in the west mediterranean than in the east mediterranean area, suggesting the existence of genuine var. sylvestris in the west mediterranean  <cit>  but questioning the status of naturally growing olive trees in the southeastern mediterranean. the genetic variation of populations of var. sylvestris potentially could have enormous importance in breeding programs aiming at the introduction of wild alleles conferring valuable traits that were lost during the domestication process  <cit> . on this background, knowledge of the status of naturally growing populations of olives is of high importance for developing conservation programs for this valuable germplasm. conservation efforts should also address the risks of hybridization and introgression from domesticated crops into populations of their wild relatives  <cit> , as recently shown for fruit trees  <cit> .

to determine the identity of naturally growing olive populations in israel as wild var. sylvestris, feral  or perhaps as abandoned groves, we used ssr markers for the analysis of six naturally growing olive populations sampled at close to far distances from extant cultivated groves. in a previous study we already used a multi-locus lineage  analysis with the same ssr markers to infer cultivar identity in the same region  <cit> . we could show the dominance of one clone in scions, and that another clone is frequent in rootstocks of grafted trees. we used these earlier results to assess genetic similarity between supposedly wild populations and local old cultivated olive trees. more specifically, we hypothesize that genuinely wild populations , if such exist, will be genetically different from cultivated olives and feral populations. on this background, a population of naturally growing olives from outside the hypothetical natural distribution range of wild olives in the region  <cit>  was included as potential reference as a feral population.

RESULTS
multi-locus lineage analysis
the genetic analysis included  <dig> naturally growing olive trees sampled in six populations in israel . using  <dig> ssr markers, the number of alleles per locus in the total of  <dig> trees ranged from four to  <dig> . raw microsatellite data for the  <dig> markers is available in the additional file 2: table s <dig>  analysis of multi-locus genotypes  and grouping of mlgs into multi-locus lineages  reduced the probability of mistakes resulting from ssr genotyping errors, thus permitting the comparison of naturally growing populations with grafted old olive trees  <cit> . the multi-locus lineage analysis  showed that  <dig> trees each of the naturally growing and cultivated trees at bgr belonged to the most commonly cultivated regional clone mll <dig>  <cit> . one of the remaining nine trees belonged to mll <dig> and the remaining eight trees were assigned to site-specific single occurrence mlls of which seven were found in naturally growing trees. in zur, only three distinct mlls were found, with  <dig> trees assigned to the cultivated mll <dig>  one to mll <dig>  and only two to a site-specific mll. in contrast, trees sampled in idm  and the carmel populations nor, bor and ofr generally belonged to site specific mlls. whereas both bor and ofr contained a small number of trees with mll <dig>  and the two sampled cultivated trees in ofr belonged to mll <dig>  neither mll <dig> nor mll <dig> were found in idm and nor. other than these two common mlls, no mlls were shared between populations .table  <dig> naturally growing olive populations used in this study and their geographical distribution  within  and outside  the hypothetical natural distribution range of var. sylvestris  <cit>

the number of trees assigned to each mll and the total number of mlls found in each population are given. for comparison, mlls of suckers and scions of cultivated old olive trees are indicated. site-specific and single occurrence  mlls are indicated in bold; mll <dig> and  <dig> represent the most common mlls found in scions and suckers of old cultivated trees, respectively  <cit> . mlls in the bgr population represent the supposedly cultivated  and naturally growing  trees




in comparison, samples of suckers  and scions, from presumably grafted trees, belonged to  <dig> and  <dig> mlls, respectively . of the total of  <dig> mlls ,  <dig> were shared by scions and suckers, two were scion specific  and  <dig> were specific to suckers, the majority of them as single occurrence mlls .

genetic diversity estimates
the genetic diversity values  showed that values of allelic richness and mean number of private alleles per locus found in idm and nor were higher than those found in the other populations. the average number of private alleles per locus in ofr  was the lowest among the six populations and in comparison to scions  and suckers . no noticeable differences among populations and cultivated trees were found in observed and unbiased expected heterozygosity values .table  <dig> observed  and unbiased expected  heterozygosity, allelic richness  and mean number of private alleles per locus  in the populations analyzed

diversity values were calculated for one individual sample per mll ; data for old cultivated olive trees, sucker and scions were extracted from barazani et al.   <cit> 




further analysis of private allelic richness indicated that idm and nor had the highest number of private alleles per locus  when corrected for sample size using adze  <cit> . the number of private alleles in  <dig> different combinations of populations is presented in the additional file 4: figure s <dig>  the highest number of private alleles shared by two populations was found in the combination of idm and nor . in the combination of three populations, the highest number of private alleles was found in idm together with bor and nor, and in the combination of four populations in idm, bor, nor and ofr. the combination of these four populations with suckers yielded the highest number of private alleles per locus . any combination of suckers from idm, bor, nor and ofr with scion mlls resulted in smaller numbers of private alleles per locus . in combinations of two populations with suckers, the number of private alleles per locus was substantially higher in idm and nor with suckers than in bor and ofr with suckers .fig.  <dig> mean number of alleles per locus as a function of sample size of the populations analyzed and of suckers and scions of old cultivated trees




genetic differentiation among wild growing populations and cultivated olives
the pairwise fst analysis  revealed that bgr and ofr are most similar to each other , while the highest genetic differentiation was found between populations zur and idm  and between zur and nor and bor . bor and nor were very similar to idm .table  <dig> pairwise fst values between naturally growing olive populations




rousset’s â values  indicated close genetic similarity between trees from populations zur and bgr and mll <dig>  and between zur and mll <dig> . considering that trees of population zur were assigned to only three mlls , these results are not surprising. trees from ofr also showed relatively high similarity with mll <dig> , whereas nor, bor and idm were found to be most divergent . comparisons with mll <dig> showed a similar pattern, except for individuals from bor which are relatively more similar to mll <dig>  than to mll <dig> fig.  <dig> heat-map illustration of rousset’s genetic distances between naturally growing populations and multi-locus lineages mll <dig> and mll <dig>  common to scions and rootstocks of grafted old olive trees  <cit> 




population genetic structure
results of the structure analysis are provided for k =  <dig> to  <dig> . a clear peak of ∆k suggested that k =  <dig> is the optimal number of subgroups .fig.  <dig> inferred genetic structure of scions and rootstocks of grafted old olive trees and naturally growing populations of olive trees in the southeast mediterranean. bayesian clustering with the admixture model implemented in structure was used to assign individual mlgs to genetic clusters . individual mlgs within each group are represented by vertical bars and genetic groups are shown in different colors




confirming the mll analysis, mlgs of scions were found to be fairly homogenous at all given ks. the dominance of the scion cluster in the cultivated olive individuals sampled in bgr was also evident at all ks, and a similar genetic structure was also found in trees from zur . naturally growing trees at bgr showed evidence of admixture and resembled the genetic structure found in suckers . at k =  <dig>  the other naturally growing populations from the galilee  and carmel  also showed an admixed genetic structure resembling that found among suckers.

discussion
the existence of wild olive trees  in israel was here investigated by using ssr variation in naturally growing populations. based on a bayesian analysis of ssr markers, it has recently been suggested that  <dig> trees sampled outside cultivated groves in israel are presumably feral  <cit> . however, although that analysis included supposedly wild ‘oleaster’ trees that were collected within  and outside  the putative distribution range of var. sylvestris, it did not include the most common cultivars in the southeast mediterranean region, which renders the conclusions rather hypothetical. here, a genetic comparison between grafted old olive trees  and naturally growing olive trees from different populations in israel provided more comprehensive information on their identity as feral, cultivated or genuinely wild, and furthermore allowed us to obtain evidence for the possible source of rootstocks of grafted old trees.

trees at bgr showed close genetic similarity to scions of old olive trees, most strongly to mll <dig> . mll <dig>  the most common lineage among rootstocks of grafted old olive trees  <cit>  was represented once in this population, and diversity values, estimated as allelic richness and mean number of private alleles per locus, were among the lowest of all populations analyzed . considering the dominance of mll <dig> in the supposedly cultivated trees of bgr  and the similarity of their genetic structure to scions , our results confirm our a priori assumption of the existence of an abandoned grove at this site.

similarly but unexpectedly, most of the trees at zur , where wild var. sylvestris potentially can grow, were very similar to bgr in their genetic composition and genetic structure. a high number of the sampled trees in zur belonged to mll <dig> , two trees were assigned to site specific mlls, and mll <dig> was present in one individual . in addition, genetic differentiation between trees from zur and mll <dig> and mll <dig>  as measured by rousset’s value, was the lowest among all pairwise comparisons , and the genetic diversity values were lowest of all populations investigated . thus, although the zur site is best characterized as mediterranean garrigue , and has no resemblance with a grove in terms of tree spacing, traces of former terraces, etc., our results indicate that most trees at this site represent an old abandoned olive grove.

the remaining four populations  are very different in their genetic composition from bgr and zur. trees from idm  and the three carmel populations  were found to be similar in terms of relatively high genetic diversity values , and genetic differentiation from both bgr and zur  and from mll <dig> and mll <dig> is high . however, while the carmel populations contain large numbers of single occurrence mlls , higher than those found in suckers of cultivated trees , 68% of idm samples belonged to five site-specific mlls , indicating a high frequency of clonal reproduction and/or inbreeding. indeed, we found indications of inbreeding in idm . this probably can be interpreted as evidence for small effective population size and a high degree of isolation of this population from others. beyond these peculiarities of idm, this population and bor, nor and ofr fall into two groups. whereas nor and idm do not contain the common scion  or rootstock  mlls, both ofr and bor contain the rootstock mll <dig> , explaining their similarity to the common rootstock genotype , and ofr also contains the scion mll <dig>  furthermore, idm and nor showed the highest number of private alleles and of alleles that are private to the combination of two populations , and, among these four populations, are most similar to each other . the number of private alleles per locus was higher in a combination of suckers, idm and nor than in the combination of suckers, bor and ofr . finally, considering the structure analysis at k =  <dig> , idm and nor appear to be more similar to suckers than bor and ofr in terms of variation of admixed genotypes. in bor, genotypes with a high proportion of red and green and a low proportion of blue are common, whereas in ofr a relatively high proportion of blue is common. genotypes are more variably admixed in idm and nor. taking all evidence together, idm and nor are most distinct from bgr and zur, and bor and ofr have a somewhat intermediate genetic structure. this in our opinion allows two interpretations:

first, idm and nor should be considered wild populations. this interpretation would confirm previous reports that indicated that supposedly wild populations from carmel and galilee genetically resemble wild olive populations from turkey and syria  <cit> . as we had demonstrated before  <cit>  that the majority of old olive trees in the southeastern mediterranean were maintained by grafting , the similarity in genetic structure between idm and nor on the one hand and suckers of old cultivated olive trees on the other hand would imply that scions were grafted on wild growing olive trees . similarly, a recent genetic survey of scions and rootstocks of old olive trees in the iberian peninsula suggested that old olive trees were grafted on wild growing trees  <cit> . based on the distances between grafted trees and their spatial arrangement within the groves, diez et al.  <cit>  additionally suggested that natural forests were transformed into olive orchards by grafting. in contrast to the situation in spain, traditional olive groves in the southeastern mediterranean are found in terraces with equal distances between trees, suggesting that in this region grafting was practiced in the grove itself. this would imply that scions were grafted on saplings that could have been transplanted from outside the grove or germinated in nurseries within it.

second, the interpretation of the similarity in genetic structure between idm and nor on the one hand and suckers of old cultivated olive trees on the other hand can be reversed: such interpretation would imply that the naturally growing trees at idm and nor are remnants of old cultivated trees in which the scion-derived trunk died and was replaced by suckers. if this interpretation of idm and nor as essentially feral should be correct, populations bor and ofr may represent an intermediate stage in the transition of orchards into naturally growing populations of feral origin. however, as naturally growing trees at nor and idm grow in conditions that are unsuitable for agriculture , it seems more likely to us that they represent wild than abandoned cultivated trees taken over by their suckers.

CONCLUSIONS
the comparison of naturally growing olive tree populations with mll genotypes of scions and suckers of old cultivated olive trees in israel allowed us to assess the status of naturally growing populations as abandoned groves, feral or wild var. sylvestris. the interpretation of two of six populations analyzed as wild var. sylvestris implies that grafting in the past used wild plants as rootstocks. in an area where olive cultivation has a history of several thousand years, it is astonishing to have identified naturally growing olive tree populations which are partly well-differentiated from cultivated plants. considering the high abundance of cultivated and feral olive trees in the region, conservation of this valuable genetic material is of greatest importance.
