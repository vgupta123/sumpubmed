BACKGROUND
cotton  is the most important fiber crop in the world and one of the most important oilseed crops. within the genus gossypium, two cultivated allotetraploid species, g. hirsutum l. and g. barbadense l., account for 90% and 8% of the world cotton production respectively  <cit> . the construction of a molecular genetic map is a foundation in genetic dissection of economically important traits, marker-assisted selection , and map-based cloning. it provides new insights into genome structure and chromosomal architecture of the cotton genome. however, the allotetraploid  species has a large genome size of ~  <dig> mb  <cit> , which has hindered the development of a high-density map.

to explore the cotton genome structure and to identify quantitative trait loci  for agronomically important traits which can facilitate mas in cotton, several genetic maps have been constructed including high-density interspecific  <cit>  and intraspecific maps  <cit> . the early cotton genetic maps were comprised of only restriction fragment length polymorphisms   <cit> ; later, polymerase chain reaction -based markers were widely adopted, including random amplified polymorphic dna , amplified fragment length polymorphism , simple sequence repeat , sequence-related amplified polymorphism , and target region amplification polymorphism   <cit> . among the molecular markers, ssrs have become popular markers of choice for cotton genetic analysis and mapping.

ssrs, consisting of a variable number of tandem repeats, are mainly characterized by their high frequency, even distribution, co-dominance, reproducibility, and high polymorphism  <cit> . because of these characteristics, microsatellites have become the most favoured genetic markers for plant breeding and genetics such as genetic diversity assessment, genetic map construction, qtl mapping, and marker aided selection, etc  <cit> . in general, ssrs are identified from either genomic dna or cdna sequences. the usual source sequences for ssrs have included ssr-enriched library clones, expressed sequence tags , and bacterial artificial chromosome end sequences  <cit> . however, conventional ssr marker development  is costly and time consuming  <cit> . in recent years, with the rapid increase of ests in public databases and the advent of bioinformatics tools, ssr marker development has become easier and more cost-effective. mining ssrs from ests is becoming popular for ssr development.

thanks to global efforts,  <dig> ssr markers have been released  up to  <dig>  among these ssrs, more than half are est-ssrs. however, compared to the huge ests tank of cotton, only ~25% of the cotton ests is applied to ssr development. cotton ests are still a valuable resource for ssr marker development, especially for gene-derived ssrs. it is worth mentioning that the genetic map constructed by guo et al. contains  <dig> % functional marker loci, of which  <dig> % are est-ssr loci  <cit> . high-density genetic maps of est-ssr markers are an essential tool for enhanced genome analysis. they represent the transcript part of the genome and can be links between genetic and physical maps  <cit> . moreover, as est-ssrs target coding regions of the genome, they may be useful in association with genes of known function to facilitate the dissection of complex traits  <cit> .

with an endless effort to construct a high-density genetic map of cotton in our laboratory, we have tried rapds, sraps, and ssrs when no sufficient easy-to-use markers such as ssrs in cotton were available  <cit> . in the last  <dig> years, the cotton est project and genome sequencing project generated a great number of sequences that could promote the marker development, and thousands of est-ssrs and bac-end ssrs have been developed. benefited from these projects, we constructed an ssr-based genetic map using ssrs available in  <dig>  <cit> . thereafter,  <dig> new gh-prefixed ssrs  <cit> , new nau-prefixed ssrs  <cit> , and more recently  <dig> genomic ssrs    <cit>  have been released. in this study, we enriched our ssr-based map by these new ssrs; we also isolated and mapped ssrs from ests with blast hits to known genes, from newly released ests of g. hirsutum by yuxian zhu , and from newly developed ests of g. barbadense in our laboratory. additionally, our recently published markers were also included in this map  <cit> , and a final map with  <dig> loci map was constructed. this sequence-based, high-density map allowed us to detect segregation distortion regions within the whole genome, to identify gene distribution on chromosomes and homologs between chromosomes.

RESULTS
marker development
a total of  <dig> new est-ssrs were developed from the assembled cotton ests in the tigr database http://www.tigr.org based on the criteria of marker development :  <dig> from g. arboretum ,  <dig> from g. raimondii , and  <dig> from g. hirsutum .

the  <dig> ests released by yuxian zhu were clustered and assembled into  <dig> unique sequences, consisting of  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. a total of  <dig> unique est-ssrs  were developed from these sequences.

the  <dig> ests from developing fiber of g. barbadense acc. 3- <dig> generated in our laboratory were clustered and assembled into  <dig> unique sequences, consisting of  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. a total of  <dig> novel est-ssrs  were developed from these sequences.

all the marker primers, sequence id, sequences, motifs, estimated product size, and blastx results are listed in additional file  <dig> 

maker polymorphism
of the  <dig> gh-prefixed gssrs derived from g. hirsutum,  <dig> ssrs  showed polymorphism and generated  <dig> polymorphic loci with an average of  <dig>  loci/ssr. among the  <dig> and  <dig> nau-prefixed est-ssrs derived from g. raimondii and g. hirsutum, respectively, and  <dig> gssrs from bac sequences of g. hirsutum,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  ssrs were polymorphic, and they generated  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> loci, respectively, with an average of  <dig>  loci/ssr,  <dig>  loci/ssr, and  <dig>  loci/ssr, respectively.

for these est-ssrs from the assembled ests in tigr,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  ssrs were polymorphic for est-ssrs from g. arboretum, g. raimondii, and g. hirsutum, respectively, and they generated  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> loci, respectively. one hundred and sixty-eight ssrs  of the  <dig> est-ssrs  were polymorphic and  <dig> loci were produced;  <dig> ssrs  were polymorphic from the  <dig> est-ssrs  and  <dig> loci were produced.

map construction and overview
a total of  <dig> loci obtained in this study, adding to the  <dig> loci published by zhang et al.  <cit>  and other published loci  <cit> , a total of  <dig> loci were applied to map construction. after calculation,  <dig> loci including  <dig> ssr loci and  <dig> gene-derived loci were mapped on  <dig> cotton chromosomes; the total length of this map was  <dig>  cm with an average of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers .

the chromosome with most loci was chr <dig> ; chr <dig> and chr <dig>  were the chromosomes with the fewest loci. eighty-nine loci were on each chromosome on average, with  <dig> and  <dig> loci on at and dt subgenomes, respectively. more loci were distributed on the dt subgenome mainly because the nau-prefixed est-ssrs were from g. raimondii , the progenitor of the dt subgenome of tetraploid cotton  <cit> .

the longest chromosome was chr <dig>  and the shortest was chr <dig> ; the average chromosome length was  <dig>  cm. the total lengths of the at and dt subgenomes were  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively, which was the result of more loci on the dt subgenome to increase recombinants.

the biggest average distance between markers was on chr <dig>  and the least was on chr <dig> . the average distances for at and dt subgenomes were  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively, which also benefited from the more loci on the dt subgenome. the biggest gap between markers was  <dig>  cm on chr03; there were a total of  <dig> gaps > <dig> cm with  <dig> on at and  <dig> on dt subgenome, respectively.

ssrs were not evenly distributed on the cotton chromosomes with more gssrs and est-ssrs on the dt subgenome. more gssrs were on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  and more est-ssrs on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  gssrs and est-ssrs were also differently distributed on each chromosome; they were similar on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig> , but dramatically different on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig> .

for different genome-derived ssrs, the a genome-derived ssrs mostly targeted chr <dig> and chr <dig>  and of course preferentially targeted the at subgenome; d genome-derived ssrs mostly targeted chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  and also preferentially targeted the dt subgenome; the ad genome-derived ssrs mostly targeted chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  but preferentially targeted the dt subgenome.

segregation distortion
among the  <dig> polymorphic loci,  <dig> loci  including one gene-specific locus showed segregation distortion  with  <dig> loci segregating toward the 'emian22' allele and  <dig> loci toward the heterozygous allele. for ssr loci,  <dig> % of gssrs and  <dig> % est-ssrs were distorted, respectively.

a total of  <dig> distorted loci, accounting for  <dig> % of the mapped loci, were mapped on cotton chromosomes with  <dig> % segregating toward the heterozygous allele . these segregation distorted loci were unevenly distributed on the  <dig> cotton chromosomes with 3- <dig> loci on each chromosome . more distorted loci were located on the dt subgenome than on the at subgenome . the most distorted loci were on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig> , and the least on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig> . a total of  <dig> segregation distortion regions  were found on the  <dig> cotton chromosomes with  <dig> sdrs on the at subgenome and  <dig> on the dt subgenome. more sdrs were found on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  the chromosomes with the most distorted loci. the distorted loci showed a phenomenon in which loci skewing toward the same allele appeared on the same chromosomes or within the same sdrs . interestingly, adjacent markers in some sdrs showed the same degree of segregation .

annotation and functional characteristics of sequences containing ssrs
in addition to the  <dig> est-ssrs and  <dig> gene-derived markers,  <dig> gssr loci had homologous sequences to cotton ests by blastn with e ≤  <dig> e- <dig> , which indicated that they were transcribed sequences. thus, a total of  <dig> loci of this map  were functional markers. the blastx results of these transcribed loci showed that  <dig> loci sequences had no hits to protein;  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> loci sequences  had hits to known gene products, hypothetical proteins, and unknown genes, respectively .

these sequences containing ssrs totally targeted  <dig> items of molecular function with  <dig> sequences involved in,  <dig> items of biology process with  <dig> sequences involved in and  <dig> items of cell component with  <dig> sequences involved in. however, sequences on different chromosomes targeted different gene ontology  catalogs: chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig> targeted more molecular functions; chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig> targeted more biology processes; and chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig> targeted more cell components. most chromosomes targeted more molecular functions and biology processes than cell components, and some chromosomes targeted more special catalogs: chr <dig> and chr <dig> predominately targeted biology processes and chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig> predominately targeted cell components .

a correlation analysis between gssrs, est-ssrs, total loci and go catalogs showed that go catalogs were highly correlated to est-ssr and total loci; gssr was highly correlated only to the 'biology process'. the results agreed with the concept that functional ssr sequences were mainly derived from est-ssrs .

*, **: significant at the  <dig>  and  <dig>  probability levels, respectively.

on level  <dig> of the go classification, 'binding'  and 'catalytic activity'  dominated the molecular function; 'metabolic process'  and 'cellular process'  dominated 50% of the biology process; and 'cell part' , 'cell' , and 'organelle'  predominated the cellular component .

on level  <dig> of the go classification, 'nucleic acid binding', 'ion binding', 'transferase activity', 'protein binding', 'nucleotide binding', and 'hydrolase activity' predominated in nearly 70% of the molecular function; 'cellular metabolic process', 'primary metabolic process', 'macromolecule metabolic process', and 'biosynthetic process' took more than 50% of the biology process; and 'intracellular', 'intracellular part', 'intracellular organelle', and 'membrane-bounded organelle' were major items of cell component .

when taking individual chromosomes into account, we found that some go items were found only in some chromosomes, for example, chr <dig> occupied many special go items of biology process. also, some chromosomes dominated some go items, for example, chr <dig> and chr <dig> dominated the four major items of cell component .

discussion
high-density genetic maps are becoming increasingly important in theoretical and applied genetic research  <cit> . the construction of genetic maps in cotton with molecular markers has been hampered by the limited polymorphism which is  <dig> %- <dig> % between g. hirsutum and g. barbadense  <cit>  and even less  among g. hirsutum germplasms  <cit> . due to the low polymorphism and the large genome size in cotton, the only way to construct a high-density genetic linkage map is to apply more markers. in light of this, we developed new ssrs from ests annotated to proteins and newly released ests including novel ests from g. barbadense acc. 3- <dig> developed in our laboratory. as a result,  <dig> new est-ssrs were developed.

these est-ssrs showed a lower polymorphism ratio  when compared with other researches  <cit> . among the nau-prefixed est-ssrs and gssrs, only half of the polymorphism was detected compared to the results of guo et al.  <cit> . although our population and the population described by guo et al.  <cit>  are both interspecific populations, a different polymorphism was found between the two populations, which might result from different materials or different genotyping methods .

the  <dig> ssr primers developed in this study generated  <dig> loci, and with our previous data  <cit> , a total of  <dig> loci were applied to map construction. the resulting map included  <dig> loci on the  <dig> cotton chromosomes,  <dig>  cm long with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. this map is one of the three maps composed of more than  <dig> markers. compared to the map published by rong et al.   <cit>  and the map published by guo et al.   <cit> , the total map length and the average marker distance of our map were more similar to the map of rong et al.  <cit> , but longer than that of guo et al.  <cit> . the marker distribution on chromosomes was similar to the map of guo et al.  <cit>  with the most loci on chr <dig> and the fewest on chr <dig> and chr <dig>  more loci were found on the dt subgenome than on the at subgenome in our map and the map of guo et al.  <cit> , but more loci were present on the at subgenome in the map of rong et al.  <cit> . the at subgenome was longer than the dt subgenome in our map and the map of rong et al.  <cit> , but shorter in the map of guo et al.  <cit> . the average marker distance of the at subgenome is longer than that of the dt subgenome in all the three maps. the number of gaps  in our map was similar to the map of guo et al.  <cit> , but fewer than shown in the map of rong et al.  <cit> ; there were more gaps on the dt subgenome than on the at subgenome in our map, but fewer in the other maps.

by comparing the distribution of ssrs, we found that both gssrs and est-ssrs were prone to be mapped on the dt subgenome, with more gssrs and est-ssrs on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  the distributions of gssrs and est-ssrs on each chromosome were also different with four chromosomes having 50% more est-ssrs. the uneven distribution of ssrs on subgenomes and chromosomes could help us to determine the distribution of ssr motifs; and the function of ssr sequences could be conducive to further target genes in the cotton genome. the distribution of different genome-derived ssrs can provide us with some evidence for the evolution of tetraploid cotton; for example, chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig> may undergo concerted evolution because of the distributions of other genome-derived ssrs on them.

segregation distortion is widespread in plant populations. in this study,  <dig> % of the total loci showed segregation distortion , which is similar to other reports on cotton   <cit> . twice as many loci segregated toward the heterozygous allele than the 'emian22' allele, and est-ssrs showed more segregation distortion than gssrs did. for the mapped loci,  <dig> % of them were mapped on cotton chromosomes with  <dig> % segregating toward the heterozygous allele. the loci segregated toward the heterozygous allele with a high frequency because the heterozygous allele could not be distinguished from the '3-79' allele in the bc <dig> population. three chromosomes  showed extreme segregation distortion in that >50% of loci were distorted, among which  <dig> % of the distorted loci segregated toward the heterozygous allele . other maps have also proved that these chromosomes show more segregation distortion  <cit> . the extremely distorted chromosomes indicated to us that segregation distortion loci exist on these chromosomes. faris et al.  <cit>  and kumar et al.  <cit>  used reciprocal backcross populations to identify segregation distortion loci in aegilops tauschii and tetraploid wheat, respectively, which provided us with an example for identifying segregation distortion loci in cotton. the loci skewing toward the same allele clustered on the same chromosomes or within the same sdrs indicated that genetic hitchhiking effects occur in cotton.

more than  <dig> est-ssrs were used in our mapping population; however, only  <dig> est-ssrs were mapped. although gssrs derived from genomic sequences, their mother sequences can also be transcribed or translated. by blasting the gssr sequences to cotton ests,  <dig> gssr sequences were matched to cotton ests. as a result,  <dig> loci of this map  including five gene-derived markers were functional markers, which was fewer than those reported by guo et al.  <cit> . by blasting to the protein database,  <dig> loci were derived from translated sequences. functional annotation of these loci sequences revealed that some chromosomes preferentially targeted certain go catalogs, specifically, chr <dig> and chr <dig> mostly targeted the biology process; some go items were found only on some chromosomes, that is, many special go items of the biology process were detected only on chr <dig>  these results indicated that some chromosomes in cotton perform special functions. what's more, because these ests were mainly developed from developing fibers, this map can also be used to identify fiber-related genes and to detect expressed qtls  for fiber quality.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> new est-ssrs were developed to enrich our interspecific bc <dig> genetic linkage map. the final map included  <dig> loci on the  <dig> cotton chromosomes,  <dig>  cm in total length and  <dig>  cm in average distance between adjacent markers. segregation distorted chromosomes were identified, which is a guide to identify segregation distortion loci in cotton and to understand the mechanism of segregation distortion in interspecific cross between g. hirsutum and g. barbadense in cotton. ssr sequences were functionally annotated, which is helpful to identify functions of cotton chromosomes and to detect eqtls for fiber quality. this map can be compared and integrated with other cotton maps to construct a consensus map in cotton.
