BACKGROUND
t cell populations are characterised by two lymphocyte subsets that express distinct heterodimeric antigen-specific receptors  formed by alpha and beta chains  or by gamma and delta chains . for each chain, an antigen binding v domain is generated during lymphocyte development as a consequence of rearrangements of variable , diversity , and joining  genes. for the tr beta  and tr delta  chains, the v domain  results from a v-d-j rearrangement whereas for the tr alpha  and tr gamma  chains, the v domain  results from a v-j rearrangement. after transcription, the v-d-j or v-j rearranged sequence is spliced to the constant  gene. the tr genes are located in four discrete loci on chromosomes: tra, trb, trg and trd. the tra and trd genes are located at a single chromosomal location with the trd locus nested within the tra locus. as a consequence, the whole trd locus is excised from the genomic sequence when a first tra v-j rearrangement occurs in the tra/trd locus  <cit> .

the genomic organization of the tra/trd locus is known in human and mouse. the human tra/trd locus spans  <dig>  mb and consists of an array of  <dig> trav genes belonging to 32– <dig> subgroups, with five v genes which have been found rearranged in both tra and trd chains  . two olfactory receptor genes are interspersed among the tra genes: or10g <dig>  and or4e <dig>   <cit> . four trdv genes, with one of them located among the trav genes, three trdd, four trdj and one trdc genes, followed by a trdv gene with an inverted transcriptional orientation, form the trd locus nested within the tra locus. at the 3’ end,  <dig> traj genes and one trac gene complete the tra locus  <cit> .

the mouse tra/trd locus spans  <dig>  mb and is largely occupied by  <dig> trav genes including 9– <dig> trav/dv genes. three olfactory receptor genes  are present between trav <dig> and trav <dig> genes. the trd genes include, five trdv, two trdd, two trdj and one trdc gene, followed by a trdv gene with an inverted transcriptional orientation . at the 3' end of the locus there is a cluster of  <dig> traj, followed by one trac gene.

in contrast to human and mouse, little is known about the genomic organization of the tra and trd loci in artiodactyls. the first analyses of artiodactyl tra and trd genes were predominantly based on chromosome mapping  <cit> , cdna and genomic clone analysis . these analyses suggested that the general genomic organization of the tra/trd locus does not differ greatly from that of human and mouse, while a much larger repertoire of trdv  genes characterizes the trd chains in sheep  <cit>  as well as in other “γδ t cell high” species as cattle and pig  <cit> . due to the lack of full-scale genomic data, it was unclear whether the large number of trdv <dig> sequences was the result of the existence of multiple genes or polymorphisms among animals. different research groups have analysed the two cattle genomic assemblies  <cit> , released through public databases and continually being updated, in order to recognize the genomic organization of the tra/trd locus in cattle. despite discrepancies in the total number of trav/trdv genes, all data have confirmed that the cattle trd chain repertoire is dominated by the expression of the multigene trdv <dig> subgroup. as a matter of fact, herzig et al.  <cit>  by annotating the bovine btau  <dig>  assembly, have demonstrated the presence of  <dig> trdv genes,  <dig> of which belong to the trdv <dig> subgroup . two trdv <dig> genes, and a single gene for both trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> subgroups were identified. moreover, five trdd, three trdj and one trdc genes followed by a single trdv <dig> gene in an inverted transcriptional orientation complete the bovine trd locus. the same number of trdv <dig> genes was predicted by elsik et al.  <cit> , based on an automated gene annotation of the btau_ <dig>  genome assembly. in addition, they identified  <dig> functional trav,  <dig> traj genes and a single trac gene within the tra locus. at the same time, by manual annotation of the same btau_ <dig>  assembly, reinink and van rhijn  <cit>  have detected more than one hundred trdv genes and three hundred of trav or trav/dv genes. most recently, the bovine assembly umd <dig>  was used to re-examine the genomic sequence of the entire tra/trd locus  <cit> . the analysis has identified 371 v genes in the tra/trd locus including  <dig> belonging to the trdv <dig> subgroup, six trdd, three trdj, one trdc,  <dig> traj and one trac, most of which located within a  <dig>  mb region of chromosome  <dig>  the disparity of the data suggests that the definition of the total bovine tra/trd repertoire will be dependent on an improved genome assembly taking into account also the demonstrated high degree of heterozygosity in the bovine tra/trd locus  <cit> , for which artifactual gene expansions cannot be excluded. however, although the exact number of tra and trd genes remains undetermined, all studies imply that a wide repertoire of trav and trdv genes is present in the bovine genome.

in order to gain further insights into the genomic structure and the gene content of the tra/trd locus in “γδ high” species, we analysed the recent draft sheep genome assembly oar_v <dig>   <cit> . despite the fragmented and incomplete nature of the assembly, we have obtained important information on the sheep genomic tra and trd potential repertoire and its relationship with the expressed chain repertoires.

RESULTS
genomic organization of the sheep tra/trd locus
we employed the current texel sheep  whole genome assembly, oar_v <dig> , released by the international sheep genome consortium  to ncbi  to identify the tra/trd locus in this species. we retrieved a sequence of 1 mb  directly from the chromosome  <dig> genomic scaffold  that comprises the most 5’ variable gene of the tra locus which is embedded among three olfactory receptor genes in conserved synteny with human and mouse, and the trac gene which, by analogy with all mammalian species studied so far, is located at the most 3’ end of the locus.

all tra/trd genes within the assembly were identified and annotated using both the human sequence as a reference and the sheep cdna and genomic clones collections  <cit> . we also utilized the homology-based method, aligning the sheep retrieved sequence against itself with the pipmaker program  <cit>  . the presence in the pip of superimposed lines clearly indicates the occurrence of redundant matches between sheep genes , due to the homology among the different groups of genes. all sheep genes were classified as tra or trd on the basis of the percentage of nucleotide identity with the corresponding mammalian genes available in the gedi  database. the beginning and end of each coding exon was then identified with accuracy by the presence of splice sites or flanking recombination signal  sequences of the v, d, and j genes. the analysis of the genome sequence revealed that, as in the other species of mammals, the sheep tra/trd locus has a similar organization with the trd locus nested within the tra locus and includes, from 5’ to 3’, the trav genes , intermingled with trdv genes , seven trdd, four trdj genes and one trdc gene, followed by a single trdv gene with an inverted transcriptional orientation . at the 3’ end, the locus is completed with  <dig> traj genes and one trac gene. moreover, additional  <dig> trav and  <dig> trdv genes were identified on a total of  <dig> unplaced genomic scaffolds, which are assumed to be located within the locus on chromosome  <dig> . hence, the sheep tra/trd locus extends an additional 280 kb.fig.  <dig> sheep  tra/trd locus. schematic representation of the genomic organisation of the sheep tra/trd locus on chromosome  <dig> as deduced from the genome assembly oar_v <dig> . the unplaced genomic scaffolds nw_ <dig>  nw_ <dig> and nw_ <dig> are inserted in the map in a potential localization . the diagram shows the position of all related and no-related tra/trd genes according to nomenclature. boxes representing genes are not to scale. exons are not shown. arrows indicate transcriptional orientation of the v genes. the arrow above the line of the traj genes indicates the 80 kb region that has been magnified in the lower part of the figure



classification of the tra and trd genes
the trav and trdv genes located on the oar_v <dig>  chr <dig> genomic assembly were analysed together with the genes identified on the unplaced genomic scaffolds since it is expected that, like in the other mammalian species, these genes are all located within the tra/trd locus which in sheep is on chromosome  <dig>  consequently, a provisional nomenclature was assigned according to imgt®, the international immunogenetics information system® , and imgt® nomenclature  <cit> . particularly, within a tr v subgroup, each gene was numbered first in the locus on chromosome  <dig> and then, in the provisional ordinated unplaced scaffolds. additional file  <dig> summarizes the identified tra/trd genes. the trav and trdv subgroups were established adopting the criterion that sequences with nucleotide identity of more than 75 % in the v-region belong to the same subgroup.

we have annotated  <dig> trav germline genes, which could be assigned to  <dig> distinct subgroups. their functionality was defined, based on the imgt rules as described at http://www.imgt.org/imgtscientificchart/sequencedescription/imgtfunctionality.html  <cit> . forty-three genes were predicted to be functional , five genes ‘orf’ and  <dig> pseudogenes . in order to classify the sheep trav gene subgroups, we performed a phylogenetic analysis combining, in the same alignment, the v-region nucleotide sequences of the sheep trav genes with those of the human trav genes. all functional, orf and pseudogenes  were included in the analysis. an unrooted phylogenetic tree was made using nj method  <cit>  . the tree shows that  <dig> sheep subgroups form a monophyletic group with a corresponding human gene subgroup, consistent with the occurrence of distinct subgroups prior to the divergence of the two mammalian species. therefore, in accordance with the phylogenetic clustering, we classified each of these sheep trav subgroups as orthologues to their corresponding human subgroups.fig.  <dig> trd genes. in a, the imgt protein display of the sheep trdv genes. only functional genes, orf and in-frame pseudogenes are shown. the description of the strands and loops and of the fr-imgt and cdr-imgt is according to the imgt unique numbering for v-region  <cit> . the cdr-imgt aa lengths are indicated in square brackets. nd: not defined . in b and c, nucleotide and deduced aa sequences of the sheep trdd and trdj genes. the consensus sequences of the heptamer and nonamer  <cit>  are provided at the top of the figure and underlined. the numbering adopted for the gene classification is reported on the left of each gene. in b, the aa sequences of the trdd genes in the three coding frames are reported. in c, the donor splice site for each trdj is shown. the canonical fgxg motifs are underlined. the unusual trdj1- <dig> gene motif is in italics. in d, imgt protein display of the trdc gene. description of the strands and loops is according to the imgt unique numbering for c-domain  <cit> 



interestingly, it is of note the existence of four sheep-specific subgroups, mostly with several members, probably as a result of recent duplications in the ovine tra locus. these additional subgroups have been numbered with trav <dig> and above . in contrast,  <dig> human trav subgroups were not found in sheep . finally, in order to classify the sheep trav pseudogenes with frameshifts , we analysed their v region sequences with the imgt/v-quest tool  <cit>  using the option ‘search for insertions and deletions in v-region’ and aligned with the germline human trav sequence set from the imgt reference directory. in this way, ten sheep pseudogenes with frameshifts could be classified as trav22s <dig>  trav22s <dig>  trav23s <dig>  trav <dig>  trav42s <dig>  trav42s <dig>  trav43s <dig>  trav43s <dig>  trav44s <dig> and trav44s <dig> . altogether this trav gene analysis demonstrates that  <dig> out of  <dig> sheep subgroups are shared with humans. in table  <dig>  the total sheep trav germline repertoire is reported in comparison with the human one. it is interesting how the orthology between human and sheep genes may guide the positioning of some sheep unplaced scaffolds within the oar_v <dig>  chr <dig> genome sequence, in a syntenic region of the tra/trd locus. as an example, the sheep trav <dig> and trav <dig> genes recognised respectively in the nw_ <dig> and nw_ <dig> unplaced scaffolds , could be tentatively positioned at one of the two gaps present at the 5’ part of the tra/trd locus .table  <dig> the sheep and human germline trav repertoires

*functional or pseudogene



the definition of the four trdv subgroups and the adopted nomenclature are consistent with previous reports  <cit> . eight out of  <dig> trdv genes  have been predicted to be orf or pseudogenes , even if it is possible that the total number of v pseudogenes is slightly underestimated since the full-length coding sequence of some genes is not available . however, a phylogenetic analysis was performed to confirm the membership of the trdv1s <dig>  trdv1s <dig> and trdv1s <dig> genes to the trdv <dig> multimember gene subgroup since the level of nucleotide identity among them and between some but not all the other members is less than 75 % . thus, the nucleotide coding sequences  of all sheep trdv genes were combined in the same alignment and an unrooted tree was made using nj method  <cit>  . in the tree, the membership of the trdv <dig> genes is clearly supported by the monophyletic grouping. besides, it is worth noting the high level of nucleotide identity  between the trdv1s <dig> and trdv1s <dig> as well as the trdvs <dig> and trdvs <dig> coding regions as these sequences may represent allelic variants of the same gene  <cit> . the high percentage of nucleotide identity observed also within the flanking and intronic sequences confirmed that the trdv1s <dig> and trdv1s <dig> genes could represent the same gene indicating the occurrence of a redundant sequence in the genome assembly obtained from two individuals . more precisely, it is possible that the entire unplaced scaffold nw_ <dig> containing the trdv1s <dig> gene could be inserted within the oar_v <dig>  chr <dig> genome sequence which would result in a merge of the trdv1s <dig> and trdv1s <dig> gene models . on the contrary, trdv1s <dig> and trdv1s <dig> have to be considered distinct genes due to the low homology especially within the intronic sequence .

genomic locations and classification of the sheep trdd, trdj and traj genes were also determined . they were annotated and classified, according to the international nomenclature  with a number corresponding to their position from 5’ to 3’ within the locus. seven trdd genes were localised in a region spanning about 153 kb between trdv <dig> and trdj <dig> . to date, five and at least six trdd genes have been demonstrated in bovine and pig trd locus, respectively  <cit> . in contrast to a previous report  <cit>  but consistent with human and pig , four trdj genes are located upstream of the trdc gene. similarly to human and pig, at least  <dig> traj genes lie in the genomic region between trdc and trac .

structure analysis of the tra and trd genes
the deduced amino acid  sequences of the sheep trav genes were manually aligned according to imgt unique numbering for the v-region  <cit>  to maximize percentage of identity . only potential functional genes and in-frame pseudogenes are shown. all sequences exhibit the typical framework regions  and complementarity determining regions  and the four amino acids: cysteine  <dig>  in fr1-imgt, tryptophan  <dig>  in fr2-imgt, hydrophobic aa  <dig>  and cysteine  <dig>  in fr3-imgt  <cit> . the trav gene subgroups show a high structural diversity both in aa compositions and in length. in particular, the cdr1-imgt is five, six or seven aa long. the cdr2-imgt ranges in length from four to eight aa and the germline cdr3-imgt is two to four aa long. also the fr1-imgt is  <dig> or  <dig> aa long.fig.  <dig> cdr <dig> nucleotide and predicted aa sequences retrieved from the trd cdna clones. the first column reports the accession numbers of all cdna sequences. cdr3-imgt sequences are shown from codon  <dig>  to codon  <dig>  according to the imgt unique numbering  <cit> . they are grouped on the basis of the absence or the presence of one, two, three and four trdd genes. nucleotides of the 3’v-region and of the 5’j-region are indicated in lower cases. the sequences considered to present recognisable trdd genes are indicated in bold upper cases with the indication of the trdd gene name. nucleotide substitutions with respect to the germline trdd sequence are indicated in bold lower cases. nucleotides that cannot be attributed to any v, d or j regions  are indicated in capital letters on the left and on the right side, and in between of the trdd regions. numbers in the left and right columns indicate the number of nt that are trimmed from the 3’v-region and 5’j-region, respectively. the last column on the right indicates the trdj genes



the nucleotide and deduced aa sequences of the  <dig> traj genes identified in the genome assembly are reported in additional file  <dig>   <dig> traj genes were assessed as functional genes and they conserve the canonical f/w–g–x–g amino acid motif  . each traj gene is flanked by the j-rs at the 5' end, and a donor splice at the 3' end. two traj genes were defined as orf and three as pseudogenes.

the sheep trac exon-intron organization was determined . the trac gene consists of three translated exons and a fourth untranslated exon. the first, second and third exons are  <dig>   <dig> and 108 bp in length, respectively. the fourth exon is 547 bp. these four exons are separated by introns that are  <dig>   <dig> and 637 bp in length, respectively. the exons encode a protein of  <dig> aa. the c-domain is encoded by ex <dig> and is  <dig> aa long. the c region also comprises the connecting region  of  <dig> aa  with a cysteine involved in the interchain disulfide binding, the transmembrane  of  <dig> aa  and the cytoplasmic region  of five aa . the coding region of the texel breed trac gene has 100 % nucleotide identity with the trac gene of the white alpine breed  <cit> .

the deduced aa sequences of the sheep potential functional trdv genes and in-frame pseudogenes were also manually aligned according to imgt unique numbering for the v-region  <cit>  . apart from the typical fr, the cdr and the conserved amino acids at the canonical positions, the trdv <dig> subgroup genes share other characteristics including a  <dig> aa long highly conserved leader region  and the yf motif at positions 102– <dig> located at the 3’ end of the fr3-imgt . the trdv <dig> cdr1-imgt have a length of six, seven or nine aa. in contrast, the cdr <dig> are always three aa in length with the typical qxs motif . interestingly, three genes, trdv1s <dig>  trdv1s <dig> and trdv1s <dig> contain a deletion that spans from the last fr2-imgt aa to the sixth fr3-imgt aa, resulting in the lack of the cdr2-imgt. an identical deletion had already been found in the sheep trdv1s <dig> gene  <cit> . the germline cdr <dig> are always four aa long except for the trdv1s <dig> with two amino acids.fig.  <dig> cdr <dig> nucleotide and predicted aa sequences retrieved from the tra cdna clones. cdr3-imgt sequences are shown from codon  <dig>  to codon  <dig>  according to the imgt unique numbering  <cit> . nucleotides of the 3’v-region and of the 5’j-region are indicated in lower cases. nucleotides that cannot be attributed to any v or j regions  are indicated in capital letters. numbers in the left and right columns indicate the number of nt that are trimmed from the 3’v-region and 5’j-region, respectively. the name of the clones and the traj genes is reported



when we compared the functional trdv <dig> genes  identified in the texel sheep assembly with the database sequence collections  available in the gedi database  <cit> , we found only six matched genes with a level of nucleotide identity ranging from 100 % to 97 % along the entire sequence . as a consequence, at least  <dig> functional germline trdv <dig> genes might characterise the sheep tra/trd locus. hence, considering also the pseudogenes and/or orf we inferred that the sheep genome is characterised by the presence of about  <dig> diverse trdv <dig> genes. these data are in agreement with that found in the bovine genome  <cit> .

the trdv <dig>  trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> subgroup genes all encode for a cdr <dig> that is seven aa in length, while the cdr <dig> is three aa long for trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> and six for trdv <dig>  five and four aa are present in the germline cdr <dig> of the trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> and of the trdv <dig> gene, respectively .

the nucleotide and deduced aa sequences of the seven trdd genes identified in the genome assembly are reported in fig.  <dig>  they consist of a nine ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 15 bp  sequence that can be productively read in its three coding frames. the 5’d-rs and 3’d-rs that flank the d-region are well conserved.

the trdj genes are typically 49–59 bp long . each trdj gene is flanked by the j-rs at the 5' end, and a donor splice at the 3' end. the coding regions were all predicted to be functional except for the trdj1- <dig> gene where the f-g-x-g motif whose presence characterises the functional j genes, is altered. this gene has never been identified within cdna clones  <cit> . the three functional trdj genes present 100 % nucleotide identity with the same genes identified in the sheep altamurana breed  <cit> .

the exon-intron organization of the trdc gene was also determined . the sheep trdc gene encodes a protein of  <dig> aa. as already described  <cit> , it is composed of three translated exons plus a fourth untranslated one. the c-domain is encoded by ex <dig> and is  <dig> aa long as in cattle. the c region also comprises the connecting region  of  <dig> aa  with a cysteine involved in the interchain disulfide bridge, the transmembrane  of  <dig> aa  and the cytoplasmic region  of five aa . also in this case, no nucleotide substitutions were found in the coding region of the texel breed trdc gene with respect to the same gene of the altamura breed  <cit> .

trd chain transcript analysis as evidence for trdd and trdj gene usage
to evaluate the contribution of each trdd and trdj gene in the formation of the trd chain repertoire, a total of  <dig> cdna clones available in imgt/ligm-db  <cit>  and containing rearranged productive  v-d-j-c transcripts were analysed.  <dig> of these clones  were derived from perinatal thymus of altamurana breed,  <dig>  from peripheral blood of white alpine breed and eight  from pregnant uterus of merino breed.

for a close inspection of the cdr3-imgt, the nucleotide  sequences from codon  <dig>  to codon  <dig>  that belongs to the f/w-g-x-g motif characteristic of the j-region , were excised from each clone and reported in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> dot-plot matrix of sheep/human tra/trd genomic comparison. using the pip-maker program the entire sheep tra/trd locus   or just the tr v region   have been plotted against the human counterparts  and positions  <dig> to  <dig> in  of nc_000014). the transcriptional orientation of each gene is indicated by arrows and arrowheads. coloured rectangles enclose tr v duplicated regions as referred in the text



by comparison with the trdd genomic sequences, the nt located in each sequence were considered to belong to a trdd gene if they constituted a stretch of at least five consecutive nt corresponding to one of the seven trdd germline sequences. thus, the sequences were grouped according to the absence or the presence of one or more trdd genes. in particular, we observed six clones with no recognisable trdd gene that could be interpreted as direct v-j junction. however, it is also possible that nucleotide trimming masked the initial participation of d gene during the rearrangement. in  <dig> clones, there is the presence of a single trdd gene, while  <dig> and  <dig> clones have two or three trdd genes, respectively. only one clone  contains four trdd genes. all trdd genes but one  were recovered within the cdna clones. in some cases two or three trdd genes are continuous, in others they are separated by p/n-nucleotides. as expected, the order of the genes, within the junction with more than one trdd, corresponds to that found in the genome. a particular feature is the occurrence of nucleotide variations within the d region of four cdnas  with respect to the germline sequences.

although the number of clones are too low to be statistically significant we observed a preferential usage of the trdd <dig> , trdd <dig>  and trdd <dig>  genes in the rearrangement. in contrast, the trdd <dig> , trdd <dig>  and trdd <dig>  genes were used less frequently. in addition, a tissue-specific usage can be observed, with the trdd <dig>  gene preferentially expressed in peripheral blood, the trdd <dig>  in pregnant uterus and the trdd <dig>  in thymus.

inspection of the cdna clones has allowed us to establish the contribution of the trdj genes . a total of three trdj genes were recovered. the absence of the trdj <dig> gene confirms that it is a pseudogene. the trdj <dig> gene seems to be preferentially used in all the tissues .  <dig> out of  <dig> clones retain the trdj <dig> gene, while only four clones use the trdj <dig> gene.

by comparing with the trdv and trdj germline sequences, the degree of trimming at the 3' end of the trdv and at the 5' end of the trdj genes was estimated and reported in fig.  <dig>  the mean value of the trimming was  <dig>   for the 3' end of the trdv and  <dig>   for the 5' end of the trdj genes.

the aa sequence of the v-delta cdr <dig> loop deduced from the nt sequence reveals that it is heterogeneous for aa composition and size. the mean length is  <dig>  aa  without difference in the three tissues. by comparison, the mean length of the sheep v-beta cdr <dig> is  <dig>  aa long  and is approximately the same in spleen, thymus and blood  <cit> . the v-delta cdr <dig> length seems to be correlated to the number of the trdd genes incorporated in the loop, with a progression from clones without trdd genes  to those with one , two , or three trdd genes , reaching a maximum cdr <dig> length of  <dig> aa in the only clone with four trdd genes.

altogether these results suggest that a particularly long v-delta cdr <dig> may be a prerequisite to perform appropriate t cell functions and that this is achieved by increasing the number of trdd genes used in the rearrangement rather than reducing the level of trimming at the ends of trdv and trdj genes.

analysis of the expressed tra repertoire
the published data on the sheep tra chain repertoire are very limited if compared with those of the trd, trb and trg chains. only two entries are present in imgt/ligm-db, one for a tra mrna  <cit>  and one for a trav gene  <cit> . to evaluate features of the expressed repertoire from the analysis of the sheep tra genomic repertoire identified in the genome assembly, we designed a panel of three trav subgroup-specific 5′ primers that we used in conjunction with a trac specific 3′ primer to amplify rearranged tra chains from spleen and thymus rna samples of a single sheep . we chose the trav <dig>  trav <dig> and trav <dig> subgroups as representative of functional trav genes with four, three and two aa in the germline cdr <dig>  respectively. a total of  <dig> different clones containing rearranged productive v-j-c transcripts were analysed. as expected, all of the trav genes belonged to the identified subgroups:  <dig> clones contain trav <dig> subgroup genes ;  <dig> clones correspond to trav <dig> subgroup genes ;  <dig> clones match with trav <dig> subgroup genes . the deduced aa sequences of the cdna clones are reported in additional file  <dig> 

as the cdna clones are derived from a single animal, we have compared the nucleotide sequences of the trav regions with each other to establish the level of gene and allelic nucleotide identity. having found a minimum level of nucleotide identity of 98 % between two sequences within each trav subgroup, we have assumed that sequences with nucleotide identities ≥98 % represent allelic variants of genes; whilst, sequences with a level of identity <98 % correspond to distinct v genes.

accordingly, we found three genes and one allelic variant for the trav <dig> as well as for the trav <dig> subgroups, and seven genes and one allelic variant for the trav <dig> subgroup, in contrast to a single gene for the trav <dig> and two for both the trav <dig> and the trav <dig> subgroups identified in the genomic assembly. therefore, the majority of the expressed trav genes seem to be absent from the current assembly. each gene was designated for simplicity with a letter and, if any, the alleles with an asterisk and a number . when we compared the cdna and the germline sequences of the trav genes, we found that only one of the expressed trav gene sequences  is identical to the trav21s <dig> gene. whereas, the v25ut <dig> and v25um <dig> clones show a percentage of identity of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively with respect to the germline trav25s <dig> and trav25s <dig> genes, indicating that they might represent allelic variants. the highest percentage of identity between cdna and germline trav <dig> sequences was  <dig>  %, suggesting that they could represent different genes or, alternatively, they might represent allelic variants of genes with a high level of polymorphisms between distinct sheep breeds .

a careful analysis of the aa composition of the genes and alleles reveals that differences are distributed along the entire sequence. the leader sequence  of trav25g gene is longer than the other trav genes by two aa .

the expressed traj genes corresponded to a genomic sequence with the exception of one aa change in the traj <dig>  and traj <dig> , however both aa changes are in the rearranged cdr <dig> .  <dig> out of the functional traj genes were identified, without any tissue-specific expression. although the numbers are too low to be statistically relevant, a slight increase in the use of the traj genes located in the traj proximal region  can be observed, with  <dig> clones containing traj in this region.

for a close inspection of the v-alpha cdr <dig>  the nt sequences from codon  <dig> to  <dig> were excised from each cdna and analysed in detail . the v-alpha cdr <dig> loop is heterogeneous for aa composition, especially due to the use of different traj genes involved in the recombination process. the mean length is  <dig>  aa  and is approximately the same in spleen  and thymus . however, taking into account the trav genes, we found a slight increase of the v-alpha cdr <dig> length in the cdna expressing trav <dig> genes  compared to those expressing trav <dig>  or trav <dig> , which is probably related to the germline cdr <dig> lengths of four, three and two aa for trav <dig>  trav <dig> and trav <dig>  respectively.

by comparing with the trav and traj germline sequences we were able to determine the degree of nt trimming of the 3'-v and 5'-j. the mean of nt deletion in 3'-v and 5'-j is  <dig>  nt  and  <dig>  nt , respectively, with no differences among the tissues. however, the degree of nt trimming is slightly higher for the trav <dig> genes  rather than for trav <dig>  and trav <dig> .

the trimming level at the 3'-v found for the trav <dig> genes, is similar to that reported for the trdv genes. in both cases the size of the germline cdr <dig> is four. therefore the germline gene structure might affect the characteristics of the rearranged cdr <dig> 

comparison of sheep and human tra/trd loci
in order to better define the genomic structure of the sheep tra/trd locus, the determined sequence of the chromosome  <dig> genomic scaffold was aligned with the human counterpart, using the pipmaker program, and the alignment expressed as a dot-plot sequence comparison graph . inspection of the matrix highlights a high level of nt identity between sheep and human genes as indicated by dots and lines. particularly, a prominent co-linearity between sheep and human sequences is shown at the 3’ end of the locus, as indicated by the long contiguous line that starts from the sheep trav28s <dig> and ends to the trac gene. within this area, parallel lines show duplications around the sheep genomic regions encoding the seven trdd genes; whereas, a perpendicular line indicates the presence of an inverted region which extends between the trdv <dig> and the first trdd gene.

a clear homology unit between sheep and human is also present at the 5' end of the locus although with an inverted orientation, as indicated by the orthogonal line . even if we cannot exclude the presence of inverted regions at the 5' and 3' end of the locus in the sheep genome with respect to human, the most likely hypothesis would be errors in the assembly.

a significant number of duplicative events are detected in the central region of the locus that has led to a substantial increase in the number of the sheep tr v genes. this is more evident in the enlarged version of the matrix , corresponding to the only tr v containing regions, where parallel lines identify two duplication areas in which the sheep trav <dig> as well as the trav <dig> and trav <dig> gene subgroups have arisen through a tandem duplication event . furthermore, a noticeable feature is the presence of a section characterised by multiple homology regions, indicated by  <dig> short parallel lines or marked dots, due to the expansion of the sheep trdv <dig> subgroup members . the members of these expanded subgroups are intercalated with genes of sheep trav <dig> ; trav <dig>  trav <dig>  trav <dig> and trav <dig> ; trav <dig>  trav <dig> and trav <dig>  subgroups. the section of homology corresponds to the human counterpart containing trav22-trav23/dv6-trdv1-trav24-trav25-trav26- <dig> genes.

apparently, due to the fragmentary nature of the assembly, the size of the blocks and the number of genes included in each block should be considered a minimum. however, the mechanism of trdv <dig> amplification has undoubtedly facilitated the generation of multigene subgroups also among trav genes.

discussion
the locus tra/trd is the most complex among the tr loci. its genomic organization is well known in “γδ low” species, such as human and mouse, however little is known in “γδ high” species, such as ruminants. despite the numerous studies in cattle and the different genomic assemblies analysed, the extension and the gene content of the locus has not yet been ascertained with precision . the accuracy of the results seems to be affected by the quality of the assembly within this complex locus as well as by the difficulty in the annotation of genes with a high degree of copy number variation  polymorphism.

in this paper, we have analysed the tra/trd locus in ovis aries for the availability of the recent oar_v <dig>  release of the genomic assembly  <cit> . the scaffold of the chromosome  <dig> has been examined and a continuous region of about 1 mb corresponding to the locus has been analysed . the presence of two olfactory receptor genes at the 5’ end and the trac gene at the 3’ end, in conserved synteny with human and mouse, confirms that the sequence covers the entire extent of the locus. moreover, additional trav and trdv genes have been identified on  <dig> unplaced genomic scaffolds, which span about 280 kb and are expected to be located within the locus on chromosome  <dig> . the general genomic structure of the sheep tra/trd locus is confirmed to be as in the other mammalian species, with the trdv intermingled with the trav genes at the 5’ of the locus, with seven trdd, four trdj, one trdc and one trdv genes are nested between the tra and trd v genes and the  <dig> traj genes preceding the trac gene.

a total of  <dig> trav and  <dig> trdv genes have been identified. by the criterion that gene sequences having 75 % or greater of nucleotide identity belong to the same subgroup, the trav genes belong to  <dig> subgroups and the trdv genes to four subgroups .

the classification of the different sheep subgroups in comparison with human has allowed us to investigate the evolutionary relationships of the trav genes . the clustering of the genes in the phylogenetic tree, shows  <dig> trav subgroups, with  <dig> of them being shared between sheep and humans. these subgroups can be classified as interspecies subgroups, indicating their occurrence as distinct subgroups prior to the divergence of the two mammalian species. among these, the trav <dig> genes lie, in shared synteny at the beginning of the locus, interspersed between olfactory receptor genes in both species.

eleven human trav subgroups are not represented in the sheep genome, while four trav subgroups  have been found in sheep but not in human . the paraphyletic groupings of these sheep-specific trav subgroups indicate that duplications of a shared ancestor gene followed by diversification and expansion events, have generated these species-specific genes.

furthermore, the evolutionary relationship of the sheep and bovine trav genes was also investigated . although the incomplete nature of the sheep genomic assembly suggest that a substantial number of trav genes may not have been identified yet, six  out of  <dig> subgroups seem to be missing also in the bovine tra/trd locus . it is to be noted that four of these six subgroups  have only pseudogene members in humans . moreover, the phylogenetic analysis reveals that the four sheep-specific tra subgroups are also found in cattle , indicating the occurrence of common ancestor genes in ruminants. future information on the genomic organization of the tra/trd locus in other “γδ high” species will prove the origin of these new subgroups.

the provisional number of the trav genes identified in the sheep genomic assembly is further proven by our tra chain expression data, carried out on a single animal . in fact, the analysis of the repertoire regarding three different trav subgroups has revealed the presence of additional genes for each subgroup confirming the incompleteness of the genomic assembly sequence and that expansion events might have involved still other trav subgroups. however, cnv polymorphisms between different sheep breeds  have not to be excluded.

the multigene nature of several sheep trav subgroups explains the difference in the total amount of trav genes with respect to humans, although the number of the sheep subgroups is lower than in humans . a possible explanation for the appearance in the sheep genome of these multigene subgroups could be in part the direct consequence to the gene expansion of the trdv <dig> subgroup. the locus organisation of the sheep trav/trdv genes appears to be consistent with this hypothesis since the members of the trdv <dig> subgroup are always co-localised with trav genes, mostly belonging to expanded trav subgroups . such concomitant expansion of trav and trdv gene repertoires appears to be present also in the bovine  <cit>  and pig  <cit>  genome even if the partial sequencing of the pig tra/trd locus makes it less noticeable.

as regards to the sheep trdv germline repertoire, previous evidence supporting the presence of one trdv <dig> and one trdv <dig> gene  <cit>  as well as one trdv <dig> gene located after the trdc gene  <cit> , are consistent with our findings . the sheep trdv <dig> subgroup has been estimated to contain at least  <dig> genes  <cit> , while only  <dig> trdv <dig> genes have been identified in the genomic assembly. the existence of extensive gaps along the retrieved sequence, guarantees that additional trdv <dig> genes may be still identified in the sheep genome assembly. only complete assemblies of different genomes will fully elucidate the different v genes and alleles and solve such case as the trdv1s <dig> gene contained in the unplaced scaffold nw_ <dig> and the trdv1s <dig> gene present in the oar_v <dig>  chr <dig> genome sequence .

although the 5’ part of the locus appears partial, the 260 kb in 3’ of the tra/trd sheep locus, extending from the trdv <dig> to the trac gene, seems to be complete . seven trdd genes were identified in 80 kb sequence. the same number of trdd genes, covering about 60 kb, were identified in the pig genome with the third gene being a pseudogene  <cit> . six trdd genes were found in the bovine genome in a region of about 80 kb  <cit> . in contrast, there are only three trdd genes on a  <dig>  kb in humans and two trdd genes on a  <dig>  kb in mice.

all the sheep trdd genes are potentially functional and show canonical recombination signal  sequences  even if the trdd <dig> gene was not observed in the analysed trd transcripts derived from published databases , suggesting that, as in pig, it might be a pseudogene. the analysis of the same transcripts has demonstrated that a wide variety of cdr <dig> lengths, ranging from eight to  <dig> aa, is present, without any apparent bias towards a certain trdv gene. the cdr <dig> size depends on the incorporation or not of different and sequential trdd genes  in the formation of the trd chain during the recombination process. in some cases, the recombination process has provided a perfect d-d fusion, in other cases, extra n-region nt have been added at the junction between two d genes. the end result is a cdr <dig> loop very variable in length as well as in aa composition. similarly, the pig trd chains can use up to four d genes  <cit> , while in cattle, the trd cdr <dig> shows combinations from one up to five trdd genes with a range in length from nine to  <dig> aa  <cit> . since the cdr <dig> composition and length influence the 3d configuration of the antigen-combining site  <cit> , we speculate that v-delta domain with a long cdr <dig> loop have increased flexibility and are therefore better suited to recognise a large number of antigenic conformations. it is interesting how the vh cdr <dig> loop in cattle antibodies also shows extensive heterogeneity in size, ranging from three even to  <dig> codons. however, based on the genomic characterisation of the bovine ighd genes, it has been demonstrated that a direct contribution of the germline ighd <dig> gene rather than d-d fusions explains the origin of the long cdr <dig>  in fact, the ighd <dig> represents the single longest ighd gene among ten identified in the cattle genome, potentially capable of directly encoding  <dig> codons. further, specific insertion of novel ‘conserved short nucleotide sequences’ at the ighv–ighd junction provides the molecular basis of the origin of exceptionally long vh cdr <dig>  <cit> .

a preferential usage of the trdd and trdj genes, proceeding from  <dig> ' to 3' in the locus was also observed , but further expression studies will be needed to confirm that the genomic organization of the genes might affect the characteristics of the rearranged cdr <dig> 

similarly, our tra chain expression analysis has revealed a slight increase in the use of the traj genes located in the proximal region , consistent with the widely accepted view that trav-traj recombination proceeds in a coordinated, sequential manner from proximal to progressively more distal trav and traj genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study identifies the genomic structure and the gene content of the tra/trd locus in the ovis aries whole genome assembly. overall, the sheep genomic organization is highly conserved with respect to the other mammalian species, with the trd genes nested within the tra locus. despite the fragmented and incomplete nature of the current genome assembly in the 5' part of the locus, through phylogenetic and expression analyses, we provide evidence of an increase in the total amount of the sheep trav genes compared to those of humans due to the genomic expansion of a consistent number of different subgroups. a substantial proportion of these expanded trav genes may have occurred as consequence of the amplification of the trdv <dig> subgroup genes, typically associated with the “γδ high” species.

the essential completeness of the assembly of the 3' part of the locus has allowed a correct interpretation of the cdr <dig> formation for the tra and trd chain repertoires. if the mechanism for generating diversity in sheep tra chain appears to adhere to the paradigms established through the study of human and mouse , the use of up to four out of seven trdd genes, and the possibility of the addition of n nucleotides on either side of these, makes the potential sheep trd chain much larger than any known tr chain repertoire. this situation is quite different from humans, and suggests that the differences between “γδ high” and “γδ low” species in distribution, diversity, and function of γδ t cells may be substantial.
