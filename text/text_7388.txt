BACKGROUND
genome annotations are essential to study and manipulate microorganisms. with advances in next generation sequencing, genomes are released with ever increasing frequency and with them, new annotation pipelines are emerging  <cit> . most pipelines rely entirely on in silico prediction tools, and therefore, fail to accurately determine gene start/stop and to precisely assign gene function  <cit> . for example, nielsen et al. found that 60% of the annotated bacterial genomes contain substantial errors in start/stop codons predictions and are generally over-annotated due to a lack of thorough analysis between computationally assigned open reading frames  and real genes  <cit> . this observation has been acknowledge by the national centre for biotechnology information , which is constantly developing their prokaryotic genome automatic annotation pipeline  since  <dig>  <cit> . additionally, ncbi also routinely runs glimmer, genemark and prodigal on all complete genomes and plasmids, and makes the results available in the ftp directory of each organism.

errors in annotation are particularly abundant in large, high g + c content genomes, where gene length and gene organization vary significantly from well-annotated model organisms such as escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae or bacillus subtilis. in fact, prodigal was developed after it was observed that the accuracy in gene recognition drops considerably for high g + c content genomes  <cit> . g + c rich genomes have considerably fewer overall stop codons and larger numbers of spurious open reading frames . a comparison of genebank genomes and prodigal genome annotation showed that false orfs are often selected instead of the real orfs within the same genomic region  <cit> . these long orfs also contain a large numbers of potential start codons that lead to a considerable drop in accuracy of the translation initiation site prediction and tend to predict too many genes  <cit> .

advances in omics offer new opportunities to perform functional genome annotations. recently, qiu et al.  <cit> , performed a functional 2d annotation of the geobacter sulfurreducens genome. integration of proteomics, transcriptomics and chip-seq enabled the precise re-annotation of the genome. similarly, other authors have used proteogenomics to provide an unbiased but direct correlation between genome sequence and protein expression  <cit> . annotation of  <dig> bacterial and archea genomes using this approach has shown that purely bioinformatics-based pipelines fail to annotate mainly short-length proteins and high g + c content sequences  <cit> .

high g + c content genomes encompass the majority of actinobacteriaea, a distinct bacterial phylum capable of producing numerous antibiotics  <cit> . they include soil and marine industrial microorganisms as well as numerous animal and human pathogens. due to their relevance, a large number of actinomycete genomes have been sequenced. saccharopolyspora erythraea  is an important industrial antibiotic producer, a model actinomycetes and one of the first actinomycetes genomes sequenced. its circular genome was sequenced in  <dig>  <cit> , and comprises  <dig>  mbp  with the potential to synthesise more than  <dig> bioactive secondary metabolites  <cit> . similar to most actinomycetes, s. erythraea’s annotation was based on sequence homology and hence, prone to the associated annotation inaccuracies.

the accurate annotation of the s. erythraea genome is of significant importance, not only for its biotechnological significance but also as a model to functionally annotate other g + c rich genomes. here, we propose a functional 2d re-annotation of the s. erythraea genome by combining in silico predictions with a multi-omics approach. by integrating proteomics, transcriptomics and the use of a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction  we show the value of a systems biology driven annotation tool for the prediction of novel genes and accurately map ribosomal binding sites across the genome.

RESULTS
annotation of g + c rich genomes using prodigal  <dig> and geneprimp improves genome annotation
in an effort to perform a whole genome re-annotation using prodigal  <dig>  <cit> , orfs were annotated using blasp. genes found by prodigal were blasted against related high g + c content genomes separately and against the national centre for biotechnology information  nb database, interpro and swissprot databases for missing domains. interproscan was used to assign go/interpro ids to hypothetical proteins. the trnas were identified using trnascan-se and rrnas were identified using rrna_hmm_fs. in total,  <dig>  coding sequences were found:  <dig> trnas,  <dig> rrnas and  <dig>  genes. this re-annotation represents an increase of  <dig> genes compared to the previous annotation. of all orfs found by prodigal, only  <dig>  genes had an ec number associated to specific genes. to further explore the coding potential of the genes, all genes predicted as hypothetical proteins  were assigned to a go term or an interpro id using interproscan. using this approach, we assigned go/interpro ids to  <dig>  out of  <dig>  hypothetical proteins .

to further resolve errors in annotation, the novel and previous annotations were submitted to the gene prediction improvement pipeline   <cit> . the new annotation is available as additional file  <dig>  despite numerous errors in both annotations, prodigal  <dig> predicted  <dig> less anomalies than the previous pipeline . the use of geneprimp for genome annotation enabled manual revision of  <dig> long genes,  <dig> short genes,  <dig> broken genes and  <dig> interrupted genes. additionally,  <dig> putative missed genes, identified from the alignment of a gene or intergenic region to its homologs were detected.

rna sequencing revealed transcription of more than  <dig> intergenic regions
a close investigation into the recently published rna-sequencing data from s. erythraea <cit> , revealed substantial transcriptional content  originated from un-annotated sequences. analysis of such regions revealed transcription of ~ <dig> intergenic regions that displayed intergenic transcription , which largely coincide with the anomalies indicated by gene primp. previously,  <dig> of these intergenic regions were annotated as potential ncrnas using a range of metrics, including presence, size and structure to annotate novel independent ncrnas within intergenic regions  <cit> . the novel ncrnas displayed distinct cpc scores  <cit> , dynamic transcriptional pattern and  <dig> of them showed a distinct ncrna secondary structure. furthermore, these regions displayed strong similarities to genes from related microorganisms .

proteogenomics was used to validate novel orfs
to validate the coding potential of the novel annotated regions, we combined transcriptional data with 2d-lc ms/ms proteomics. a total of  <dig>  distinct proteins were identified from  <dig> different fermentation time points . with this approach,  <dig> orfs, previously annotated as hypothetical proteins were confirmed . more importantly, the alignment of peptides to the intergenic regions confirmed the expression of  <dig> previously unidentified proteins . using proteogenomics we validated several of the novel genes found by prodigal  <dig> . for example, a peptide was found in the intergenic region between sace_ <dig> and sace_ <dig>  which was found to be contained in the gene nc_009142_ <dig>  the peptide gdnavlalvesagnsgpnlrasklr, translated 2 bp from sace_1312/nc_009142_ <dig> , potentially represents a miss-annotation error. as evidenced previously  <cit> , incorrect annotation of the orf is caused by a frame shift in the sequence presumably due to a missing base in the genome sequencing. neither prodigal nor framed  <cit>  were able to find a new stop codon upstream of the peptide in the same frame. all novel proteins with a single peptide match were manually validated with their rna-seq transcriptional profile . only after analysing peptides in terms of gene proximity and frame localisation, was the correct annotation of  <dig> orfs and the re-annotation of  <dig> distinct full-length proteins achieved.

small rna-sequencing enabled ribosomal binding sites  annotation
we have previously used deep-rna sequencing to demonstrate targeted mrna degradation during the growth arrest stage  in the s. erythraea developmental cycle  <cit> . in this work, the mrna degradation event was used to resolve ribosomal binding sites. a detailed inspection of the alignment profile of small rnas during the metabolic switch, showed that the most abundant fragment reads for a given transcript coincided with positions where the ribosomes stall , thereby protecting the transcript from endogenous cleavage. this was validated by our proteogenomics analysis, which found new proteins that contained clear evidence of rbs . alignment of small rna sequences strongly coincides with the shine-dalgarno sequence . we also observe a 3 bp periodicity in small rna occurrence, coinciding with the transcription programme of the ribosome .

use of the genome-scale metabolic reconstruction  to improve functional annotation
we recently reconstructed a metabolic network based on the genome of s. erythraea <cit> , which was used to direct amino acid media supplementation strategies to improve erythromycin production. the reported metabolic reconstruction consists of  <dig>  reactions  and  <dig>  metabolites, from which, as part of the manual curation,  <dig> reactions were added and  <dig> were identified as essential for growth in minimal media. here, we use gsmr in silico simulations to provide evidence for the presence of these orphan enzymes . as previously reported for the closely related organism streptomyces coelicolor <cit> , we searched for orfs that fulfil specific functions and validated our findings by searching for gene synteny with related actinomycetes.

a common example of missing gene annotation in most actinomycetes is for the enzyme cardiolipin synthase  <cit> . this enzyme contains two phospholipase d-like domains  and catalyses the condensation of two phosphatidyl-glycerol molecules into cardiolipin. screening of the s. erythraea genome revealed a strong candidate orf containing two pldc domains. therefore, we suggest that sace_4234/nc_009142_ <dig> might be performing such enzymatic activity. similarly, udp-glucose-d-galactose-1-phosphate-uridylyltransferase requires a galp_udp transferase domain at each end of the protein. the orf sace_0764/nc_009142_ <dig> emerged as the sole candidate to fulfil this metabolic function. comparably, a pyrophosphatase protein domain was found in orf sace_0391/nc_009142_ <dig>  implying its re-annotation as inorganic diphosphatase.

the next orphan enzyme identified by the gsmr was the enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine-n-methyltransferase, which contains a pemt  domain. the genome of s. erythraea contains two orfs with such domain ; however, these genes also contain other domains, including mfs_ <dig>  and phag_mnhg_yufb . the multiple domains contained within such enzymes prevented us to clearly identify a candidate orf to fulfil that particular enzymatic function. similarly, the enzyme -3-hydroxyisobutyryl-coa hydrolase contains two domains, ech and ech_c . the s. erythraea genome contains  <dig> orfs with at least one of those domains and four orfs contain both domains with high confidence  . after analysing all neighbouring genes, we concluded that the most likely genes to fulfil such function were genes sace_1458/nc_009142_ <dig> and sace_1464/nc_009142_ <dig>  those two genes share synteny with members of the family of mycobacterium and corynebacterium. similarly, three orfs  contain the pgm_pmm  domains required to perform the reaction of n-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate- <dig> -phosphomutase. the three genes have similar genomic context; however, sace_6779/nc_009142_ <dig> performs the same chemical reaction with a similar substrate . it is possible that it has relaxed substrate specificity and binds n-acetyl glucosamine 6-phosphate in addition to n-glucosamine 6-phosphate.

finally, our search to annotate the atp deoxyuridine 5'-phosphotransferase, which contains a thymidine kinase  domain, was unsuccessful. this result highlights the need for better genome annotations, especially for high g + c content microorganisms where the reaction might be performed by an unrelated gene or by promiscuous enzymes  <cit> .

discussion
it is well accepted that genebank files, particularly genomes annotated more than 10 years ago, contain many mistakes. this has been evidenced when comparing gene bank files with prodigal gene predictions. however, despite these observations, most groups are still using these genebank files as the reference for omics comparison, generation of metabolic network reconstructions or for metabolic engineering. current genome annotation pipelines predict gene function based on sequence homology. however, when there is insufficient similarity between the query and the database, gene function cannot be predicted. this problem is exacerbated for pseudo-genes, genes with programmed or artificial frame shifts or high g + c content genomes  <cit> . out of the ~ <dig> million orfs  deposited in patric,  <dig>  million are categorised as hypothetical proteins  <cit> . this indicates that, on average, 30% of the bacterial coding potential remains unknown. in the s. erythraea genome, more than 45% of its orfs are annotated as hypothetical proteins  <cit> . the large number of genes with unknown function is likely to be the result of random horizontal gene transfer, an unusually high g + c content and a large genome. comparison between the current genebank file and the prodigal annotation for s. erythraea, evidenced that in addition to the  <dig>  genes initially predicted,  <dig> new genes were found and  <dig>  genes differed in the re- annotation of start sites. a close comparison between the previous annotation and the prodigal annotation revealed that  <dig> genes differed in gene start/end site .

a combination of in silico predictions, rna-seq, proteomics and the use of a gsmr were used to improve the genome annotation of s. erythraea. analysis of rna-seq data identified ~ <dig> intergenic regions with high expression  <cit> . using the geneprimp pipeline we found that most of these transcribed regions have extensive homology to un-annotated regions in other species, highlighting the importance of a new annotation. the use of the gsmr also enabled the identification of orphan enzymes required for growth in minimal media.

proteogenomics further identified novel orfs with robust and dynamic expression despite their notably smaller size . discovery of these novel features not only demonstrates the value of proteogenomics to correct genome annotation errors, but also confirms the lack of sensitivity of gene prediction tools for annotating genomes. in fact, a proteogenomic data comparison between various bacteria and archea genomes found that the number of annotation errors increase for short-length high g + c content sequences  <cit> .

ribosomal binding site prediction is normally achieved by sequencing rna after nuclease digestion and ribosomal recovery by ultracentrifugation  <cit> . a detailed protocol of the current method is described by ingolia et al. <cit> . the protocol has been used to map rbs in embryonic stem cells  <cit> , to study the effect of drugs in cancer therapy  <cit> , for mapping of the rbs in yeast  <cit>  and to study translation dynamics in bacteria  <cit> . in actinomycetes, rnase and protease activities regulate the developmental cycle  <cit> . it has been recently demonstrated that endogenous nuclease activity  occurs -and is required- for antibiotic production and proper mycelia development in s. coelicolor <cit> . in fact, during the metabolic switch in s. erythraea, the entire transcriptome is reorganised by a tightly regulated targeted mrna degradation programme  <cit> . in this work, this endogenous rnase activity was used in analogy to the in vitro nuclease digestion from the ribosomal foot printing protocol. we found that this in vivo rna degradation is suitable for rbs profiling in actinomycetes.

CONCLUSIONS
actinomycetes are able to produce a large number of secondary metabolites of great pharmaceutical and industrial importance. however, as shown here, large g + c-rich genomes require experimental validation for accurate genome annotation. the combined use of proteogenomics, mrna sequencing and a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction greatly improved genome annotation. better genome annotations are likely to disentangle the fascinating and largely unexplored, genome potential of actinomycetes.
