BACKGROUND
accumulating evidence suggests that immune-related molecules tend to be involved in neuronal development and maintenance, and a number of molecules have been reported to possess neuronal functions, such as complement c <dig>  <cit> , c1q  <cit> , schnurri- <dig>  <cit> , and cd <dig>  <cit> . cd <dig>  originally identified as playing a role in hematopoietic cells and leukocytes and in the pathogenesis of leukemia and hiv infection , has a critical role in oxytocin  secretion in the hypothalamus and in the regulation of social memory and social interactions  <cit> . the mechanism underlying the regulation of ot release from oxytocinergic neurons involves increases in intracellular ca2+ concentrations by mobilization of ca2+ from ryanodine receptors  to intracellular ca2+ pools by cyclic adp-ribose . cd <dig>  together with cd <dig>  is a member of the adp-ribosyl cyclase family, which catalyzes the formation of cadpr from β-nad+  <cit> .

cd <dig>  discovered as bone marrow stromal cell antigen- <dig>  by hirano and colleagues , is a cell-surface molecule that supports pre-b cell growth with enhanced expression on bone marrow stromal cell lines derived from rheumatoid arthritis patients  <cit> . bst- <dig>  expressed by myeloid cells as a molecule capable of signal transduction, was clustered as cd <dig> after gene cloning  <cit> . cd <dig> is expressed abundantly in the immune tissues of adult mice, e.g., in the spleen  <cit> ; therefore, cd <dig> can be classified as an immune molecule. under inflammatory conditions, the homophilic binding of cd <dig> between the blood vessel endothelial cells and lymphocytes promotes lymphocyte migration  <cit> . cd <dig> is considered to play a role in the progression of chronic leukocytic leukemia  <cit> . in addition, cd <dig> is involved in the pathophysiology of various diseases  <cit> . its involvement in rheumatoid arthritis was implicated in the study that reported its discovery  <cit> . cd <dig> has been shown to support b lymphocyte survival in rheumatoid arthritis, although the mechanistic basis of this observation is not yet clear. cd <dig> stimulates neutrophil migration to sites of inflammation  <cit> . the expression of cd <dig> in ovarian carcinoma cells is an indicator of malignancy and a higher rate of metastasis  <cit> .

while investigations have intensively focused on inflammation and the immune system, little information regarding the other functions of cd <dig> has been reported. in  <dig>  however, genome-wide association studies  identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the cd157/bst <dig> gene on human chromosome 4p <dig> as new risk factors for parkinson’s disease  in the japanese population  <cit> . fifteen subsequent reports confirmed the above findings in different populations, including subjects of european descent from france, australia, the uk, and the netherlands, and in ashkenazi jews and asian populations, such as the chinese and korean populations . although six reports yielded contradictory findings , all other gwass identified intronic snps in the cd157/bst <dig> gene that predispose carriers to pd. these gwass indicated that cd <dig> snps confer a small  risk for pd. thus, as suggested by a previous study in taiwan  <cit> , additional genetic and environmental factors may be needed to determine the pathogenic role of cd <dig>  nonetheless, it is worth considering how cd <dig> contributes to the occurrence of pd or to at least one or a variety of pd symptoms. previously, we examined the neuronal function of cd <dig> by analyzing the phenotypes of cd <dig> deletion mice that would presumably provide insights into the neuronal functions of cd <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the results obtained indicated no motor dysfunction but social behavioral impairments in cd <dig> knockout  mice such as apathy-, anxiety-, and depression-like behaviors  <cit> , which are slightly different from the expected phenotypes involving motor dysfunction that are commonly observed in pd.

recently, wu et al. reported that nanodiamond particles can be transferred into transplanted cd45−cd54+cd157+ lung stem/progenitor cells  <cit> . yilmaz et al. reported that fasting results in the activation of the mtorc <dig> pathway and induction of cd <dig> in paneth cells in the adult mouse intestine  <cit> . the product of the cd <dig> catalyzed reaction, cadpr, inhibits differentiation of intestinal stem cells to acinar cells, and thus facilitates proliferation of intestinal stem cells. these results suggest that cd <dig> is an enteric protein and that cd <dig> plays a role in the stem cells of two organs. however, the question about the presence of cd <dig> in neuronal stem cells remains unanswered.

here, we present new data to evaluate our previous findings regarding the functional roles of cd <dig> in the nervous system. we also present results with cd <dig> for comparison. finally, we discuss the limitations of our results and possibilities about the role of cd <dig> in the progression of pd in relation to psychiatric symptoms as well as other psychological disorders.

RESULTS
we used polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbits against a chimeric fusion protein of murine cd <dig> that had been preabsorbed with cd <dig>  to examine its specificity for cd <dig>  in c57bl/6n wild-type adult mice, cd <dig> immunoreactivity was shown in the white pulp region of the spleen, where cd <dig> was enriched , while no staining was observed in cd <dig> knockout  mice. these immunofluorescence results clearly indicate that our antibody is specific to mouse cd <dig>  on the basis of this specificity, we decided to assess cd <dig> immunoreactivities in the brains of embryos.fig.  <dig> specificity of rabbit antiserum for murine cd <dig>  representative images of cd <dig> immunoreactivity  in the spleens of wild-type  and cd <dig> ko  adult male mice. the tissues were incubated with the rabbit antiserum against murine cd <dig>  after washing, the sections were treated with alexa fluor 488




presence of cd <dig> in brain stem cells
strong staining for cd <dig> in immunofluorescence images obtained using a confocal microscope was seen in the hypothalamus of e <dig> embryos . cd <dig> immunoreactivity was detected in the cytoplasm or at the cell surface of many but not all nestin-positive cells in the ventricular and subventricular zones beside the third ventricle . this colocalization was examined further by quantitative colocalization analysis . as shown in fig. 2b, three representative cells show that the degree of overlap of the fluorescence signals is greater than 50%. we estimate that this colocalization is limited to the embryonic stem cells. however, we did not examine the presence of cd <dig> in adult mouse brain stem cells, although this is an interesting topic and should be examined further.fig.  <dig> immunohistochemical analysis of cd <dig> expression in the embryonic brain. a representative images from the e <dig> embryonic hypothalamus: cd <dig> stained in green, nestin in red, and the nucleus in blue. b an enlarged image indicated in   shows the colocalization patterns of cd <dig>  and nestin  in individual cells. colocalization diagrams of green  and red  channels in three cells indicated in the image illustrate overlap in the individual cells. the x- and y-axes indicate cell size in µm; the z-axis-fluorescence signal intensity. colocalization is estimated by calculating pearson’s correlation coefficient  and overlap coefficient . intermediate zone , subventricular zone , ventricular zone , and third ventricle 




mrna expression in neonates and adult male mice
in support of the above observation and as reported previously  <cit> , the brain cd <dig> mrna levels decreased markedly 7–14 days postnatally from the relatively high levels in the embryonic period ). this time course is the opposite of that of cd <dig>  whose mrna levels on postnatal day  <dig> represent a >25-fold increase from that on postnatal day  <dig>   <cit> .fig.  <dig>

the levels of cd <dig> mrna expression in different brain regions  in adult male c57bl/ <dig> mice were extremely low compared to that in the spleen  . in marked contrast, cd <dig> mrna was expressed abundantly in the four brain regions examined, with no significant difference in density among regions, although these densities were significantly lower than that in the spleen . taken together, these mrna and protein expression studies show the quite distinct expression profiles of cd <dig> and cd <dig>  however, for a more quantitative comparison, it is necessary to analyze brain samples by using the sybr–green i-based reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

−/− mice . cd <dig> immunoreactivity was detected in the central amygdaloid nucleus , medial amygdaloid nucleus, posteroventral part , somatosensory cortex ), medial preoptic area , secondary somatosensory cortex , and arcuate hypothalamic nucleus  of the cd157
+/+ mouse brain. little or no immunoreactivity was detected in the other brain regions examined: the hippocampus, piriform cortex, perirhinal cortex, retrosplenial granular cortex c region or the nucleus accumbens. this expression pattern of cd <dig> corresponded well with our previous findings  <cit> , although further examinations may be necessary because the volume of the amygdala was smaller in ko mice than in control mice  <cit> .fig.  <dig> immunohistochemical analysis of cd <dig> expression in the brains of adult male mice. frozen sections of wild-type  and knockout  mice were incubated with rabbit antiserum against murine cd <dig>  after washing, the sections were treated with alexa fluor  <dig>  representative photographs show cd <dig>  and hoechst-stained nuclei  immunoreactivity in cd157

enzymatic activity of cd157
an additional issue to be resolved is whether the functions of cd <dig> in neural stem cells as well as brain cells are mediated by the enzymatic products of cd <dig>  cadpr and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate , which mediate ca2+ mobilization from ca2+ pools  <cit> . this was originally reported in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by tao et al.  <cit> , who showed that cadpr is a novel regulator of ca2+ oscillations in human mesenchymal stem cells. they reported that cadpr permeates the cell membrane through nucleoside transporters and increases ca2+ oscillations by the activation of another molecule, the trpm <dig> cation channel, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  and thereby stimulating human mesenchymal stem cell proliferation.

cd <dig> and cd <dig> belong to a family with adp-ribosyl cyclase activity. the adp-ribosyl cyclase activity of cd <dig> is weaker than that of cd <dig>  <cit> . however, it is not clear whether cd <dig> has other enzyme activities, such as nad glycohydrolase or nad base exchange activities. the product of base exchange is naadp  <cit> . naadp also has ca2+ mobilization activity from different ca2+ pools  <cit> .

we examined whether cd <dig> has two enzyme activities, and especially its base exchange activity, by independently transfecting hek cells with mouse cd <dig> or cd <dig> genes. the representative western blot analysis shows protein bands of expressed cd <dig> and cd <dig> . first, the adp-ribosyl cyclase activity of cd157-transfected cells was higher than that of vector-transfected control cells  and lower than that of cd38-transfected cells . figure 5c shows that cd <dig> has little or no base exchange activity : cd157-transfected cells showed no or little naadp synthetic activity, with no discernable differences from vector-transfected control cells. in sharp contrast, cd38-transfected cells possessed significantly higher naadp synthetic activity  compared to control cells . these results suggested that the functional role of cd <dig> likely stems from the production of cadpr rather than naadp. it was also confirmed that cadpr production by cd <dig> is not high, unlike cd <dig> fig.  <dig> enzymatic synthesis of cadpr and naadp by flag-fusion proteins . a western blot analysis of flag-fusion proteins from cell lysates of vector , mouse bst- <dig> , and mouse cd <dig>  using anti-flag antibody. b, c enzyme activities for cadpr and naadp synthesis were measured by incubation of purified flag-fusion proteins  with appropriate substrates as described in the “methods” section. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> . the mean ± s.e.m. of three independent experiments is shown




social behavior in cd <dig> or cd <dig> ko mice
severe anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors were observed previously in cd <dig> ko male mice in the light–dark transition test, a standard anxiety-related behavioral test  <cit> . the transition from a light to a dark arena was significantly shorter in the cd <dig> ko mice compared with the controls , suggesting anxiety related to a novel environment. for comparison, we also performed the test in cd <dig> ko mice. while the entry frequency was markedly different, probably because of the different backgrounds of the two strains, we found no behavioral differences between cd <dig> ko and wild-type icr mice . these observations suggested that anxiety related to a novel environment is a characteristic of cd <dig> ko mice, but not cd <dig> ko mice.fig.  <dig> behaviors of wild-type  or cd <dig> and cd <dig> knockout mice in the light–dark transition test. values are transition numbers between the two compartments . the results are expressed as the mean ± s.e.m., n = 5– <dig>  *p <  <dig>  compared with wild-type controls 




finally, the phenotype in the open field was examined in wild-type and cd157
−/− mice. the time spent in the inside zone in an open field test was significantly shorter for cd <dig> ko mice than wild-type controls . the interaction time with a social target mouse in the central arena was markedly shorter in cd <dig> ko mice than in wild-type controls , as judged from the duration of immobility. the immobility time was approximately half of the total time spent in the inside zone in both the ko and wild-type mice. interestingly, this was rescued by a single intraperitoneal injection of ot with both time in the inside zone and immobility time increasing significantly . the analysis of the results by two-way anova revealed significant treatment  x genotype  interaction effects . tukey’s multiple comparison tests detected significant differences in genotype  and treatment  effects. two-way anova detected significant treatment  × genotype  interaction effects . tukey’s post hoc tests demonstrated significant differences in genotype  and treatment  effects.fig.  <dig> social avoidance of adult male mice in the open field test. the test mouse was exposed to the open field for 20 min. a social  target was present at the center of the inside arena. time in the inside zone  and time spent immobile in the inside zone  were observed in wild-type , cd <dig> ko mice , and cd <dig> ko mice given an intraperitoneal injection of 100 ng/ml ×  <dig>  ml of ot  are shown. data are means  ±  s.d., n  =   <dig>  two-way anova revealed significant treatment  x genotype  interaction effects in a  and b . values in cd157

discussion
the most important result of the present study was the finding that the function of cd <dig> is mediated solely by the second messenger cadpr and not naadp. this was the first clear demonstration of the differential action of cd <dig> in generating the ca2+-related second messengers. cd <dig> is known to have a robust ability to catalyze cadpr as well as naadp formation in several tissues, including the islets of langerhans  <cit> . naadp, as a ca2+ signaling messenger, plays an important role in insulin secretion  <cit> . however, this raises a critical question about cd <dig> mediating its functions in the nervous system and stem cells through cadpr but not naadp formation. a good example is the crucial role of both cadpr and cd <dig> in intestinal paneth cells  <cit> .

the second important finding was that cd <dig> immunoreactivity colocalized with nestin-positive cells and elements, probably neuroprogenitor or neurolineage cells, in the subventricular zone of embryos. our results indicated that cd <dig> is a functional molecule, or at least is present in stem cells, as shown in the paneth cells in the digestive tract  <cit> , lung  <cit> , and mesenchymal cells  <cit> . the functional roles in these stem cells may be due to cadpr, as shown in paneth cells. however, in the nervous system, cd <dig> may play a role in neuronal migration during neural stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis. it has been shown that cd <dig> binds with members of the integrin family  <cit> . furthermore, integrin β <dig> and the serotonin transporter interact to modulate serotonin uptake in the mouse brain  <cit> . therefore, it would be interesting to examine whether cadpr facilitates the self-renewal of neural stem cells and whether a tertiary complex of cd <dig>  integrin, and the serotonin transporter is formed in the mouse brain.

cd <dig> is a sister molecule of the cd <dig> cell-surface antigen with adp-ribosyl cyclase activity  <cit> , but the phenotypes of cd <dig> ko and cd <dig> ko mice are quite different . the role of cd <dig> in ot secretion into the brain has been established ; cd <dig> mediates cadpr production, trmp <dig> and erk1/ <dig> activation, ca2+-mobilization, and ot release  <cit>  . additionally, cd <dig> is involved in ot release by activating molecular cascades of ot autoregulation  <cit> . in contrast, cd <dig> binds with the serotonin transporter and integrin β and invokes multiple circuits to control anxiety- and depression-like behaviors  <cit> . cd <dig> plays a role in cadpr-induced ot release, which may not be identical to that of cd <dig>  . the deficiency of cd <dig> leads to aberrant behaviors, such as increased anxiety. a decrease in volume of the amygdala, an important constituent of the “social brain,” might be caused by a loss of this molecule in the neural stem cells during the developmental stages  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the scheme of cd38- and cd157-mediated molecular pathways in relation to social behavior. the scheme shows the possible molecular pathways of cadpr formation, ot release, and behavioral effects related to cd <dig> and cd <dig> in ot neurons in the social brain




the behavioral impairments in cd <dig> ko mice were rescued by ot, probably because ot directly targets the intracellular signaling networks in the social brain downstream of cd <dig>  which might be independent of cd <dig> and its downstream signaling networks . this observation suggests that ot can be used for the treatment of social avoidance in psychological disorders. furthermore, whether we can extend the results obtained in the mouse to human behavioral recovery is of interest, especially since there have been reports regarding the effectiveness of ot for impaired social interaction in cases of autism spectrum disorder  .

it has been shown that snps of cd <dig> are associated with asd . as cd <dig> is abundant in the embryonic stages, speculation regarding an association between the snps of cd <dig> and asd is understandable. recently, we found associations between asd and three snps of cd <dig> . these snps have chromosomal locations  distinct from those associated with pd   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study indicate a novel neuronal role for cd <dig> in addition to its known functions in the digestive and immune systems. therefore, cd <dig> can be referred to as a neuro-entero-immunological regulator  <cit> . the less abundant expression of cd <dig> in the adult brain raises questions about the common features associated with the late onset of pd. because cd <dig> is expressed abundantly in the embryonic brain, it may be involved in the processes of neuronal development that relate to psychiatric disorders, such as asd and schizophrenia.
