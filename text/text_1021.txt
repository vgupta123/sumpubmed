BACKGROUND
hox genes encode evolutionarily conserved homeodomain-containing transcription factors that pattern cells and tissues along the anterior–posterior body axis during metazoan development . hox proteins perform this function by serving as master regulators of expression of batteries of genes that impart identity to a cell  <cit> , and the precise regulation of hox protein activity is therefore vital for proper development. due to their central and conserved role in regional identity and fate specification during metazoan development, the mechanisms underlying the initiation, maintenance and modulation of hox gene expression have been intensively studied  <cit> . in drosophila, an elaborate network of maternally supplied and zygotically expressed transcription factors act to initiate hox gene expression properly in the syncytial early embryo, while in the cellularized vertebrate embryo, secreted signaling molecules and growth factors are employed to coordinate precise hox gene expression in time and space  <cit> . in both vertebrates and drosophila, once hox gene expression is initiated, it is maintained by the trithorax and polycomb groups of chromatin regulatory proteins  <cit> , and can be further modulated by extracellular signaling pathways, hox protein autoregulation and cross-regulation, and other mechanisms  <cit> .

as in other metazoans, hox genes are essential during the development of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans <cit> . c. elegans has only six hox genes, present in a dispersed cluster  <cit> . three hox genes, ceh- <dig>  nob- <dig>  and php- <dig>  are required for proper embryonic development  <cit> . the other three hox genes, lin- <dig>  mab- <dig>  and egl- <dig>  appear to be required only during post-embryonic development, however their expression begins in the embryo  <cit> . very little is known about the initiation of hox gene regulation in c. elegans in the embryo  <cit> , although subsequent regulation of hox gene expression in larval development by polycomb and trithorax-related proteins, signaling pathways, other transcription factors, micrornas, and hox proteins themselves, have all been noted  <cit> . elucidating the mechanisms by which hox gene expression is initiated and regulated in nematodes will broaden our understanding of this important class of developmental regulators across a larger range of animal phyla, giving us further insight into their use during the evolution of animal diversity and their function in gene regulatory networks controlling pattern formation.

our laboratory and others have studied the function of the hox gene lin- <dig> during nematode larval development, in particular during formation of the vulva, which is part of the hermaphrodite egg-laying apparatus. vulval development begins in the first larval stage  when the twelve ventral hypodermal blast cells, p1–p <dig> , divide to generate posterior daughters known as pn.p cells  <cit> : the central six pn.p cells, p <dig> p–p <dig> p, become vulval precursor cells   <cit> . during the third larval stage  the action of wnt, ras and notch extracellular signaling pathways induces the vpcs to adopt distinct cell fates in the pattern 3°-3°-2°-1°-2°-3°, where the cells p <dig> p - p <dig> p adopt 1° and 2°  fates and divide to generate  <dig> cells that form the vulval opening, while p <dig> p, p <dig> p and p <dig> p adopt the non-vulval 3° fate, which is to divide once and fuse with the surrounding syncytial hypodermis . the hox gene lin- <dig> encodes a deformed/sex combs reduced ortholog expressed in the midbody region, including the six vpcs  <cit> . lin- <dig> acts twice during vulval development. lin- <dig> is first required to generate the vpcs; in lin- <dig> null mutants, the vpcs fuse with the hypodermis during the l <dig> stage, causing a vulvaless  phenotype  <cit> . little is known about the regulation of lin- <dig> expression at this time in development. lin- <dig> is also required at the time of vpc fate specification in the l3; loss of lin- <dig> activity at this time leads to defects in vpc fate specification  <cit> . at this later time, lin- <dig> acts downstream of rtk/ras and wnt extracellular signaling pathways  <cit> .

trans-acting factors regulating lin- <dig> expression have been identified previously using a variety of methods including forward and reverse genetic analysis, evolutionary conservation, and transgenic reporter analysis. trans-acting factors regulating lin- <dig> expression during vulval development include the rtk/ras pathway transcriptional effectors lin- <dig> and lin- <dig>  <cit> , the gli family member tra- <dig> which acts downstream from the sex determination pathway  <cit> , the zinc finger protein sem- <dig>  <cit> , the novel protein lin- <dig>  <cit> , several chromatin regulators  <cit> , and lin- <dig> itself  <cit> . direct binding to sites within the lin- <dig> genomic region has been established in the case of lin- <dig> , lin- <dig>  lin- <dig> and tra- <dig>  <cit> .

we previously undertook to identify cis-acting sites regulating lin- <dig> expression  <cit> . due to the large size of the lin- <dig> genomic region  we inserted fragments of lin- <dig> genomic dna upstream of an enhancerless gfp reporter. by that method, we identified three functional elements: a 340 bp upstream fragment  that directs expression in p cells in the embryo and in their larval descendants including the vpcs, a 247 bp site from the first lin- <dig> intron that directs expression in larval ventral cord neurons, and a  <dig>  kb promoter fragment  that drives expression in p <dig> p at the time of vulval induction. expression from the last element is dependent on ras pathway function and we showed that lin- <dig>  lin- <dig> and lin- <dig> directly bind this cis-regulatory module. using an alternative approach, kuntz et al. used phylogenetic analysis to identify a number evolutionarily-conserved regions in the lin- <dig> genomic region, and showed that several of these sites also drove expression in certain cells or tissue when inserted upstream of an enhancerless gfp reporter  <cit> . these approaches both require that the site in question be able to mediate proper transcription activation of the reporter gene in vivo, and this requirement may lead to false negative results. to circumvent this issue, here we use the yeast one-hybrid assay, in which transcription factors that directly bind to a site of interest are identified, and then the function of these factors in gene regulation in vivo can be assayed  <cit> .

in our previous analysis of the lin- <dig> genomic region, we identified a number of short dna sequences in the lin- <dig> region that were strongly conserved between c. elegans and two other nematode species . starting with these evolutionarily conserved elements and the 340 bp jw <dig>  fragment, we used manual  <cit>  and robotically-assisted “enhanced y1h”   <cit>  screens to identify  <dig> c. elegans transcription factors that bind to specific lin- <dig> genomic dna fragments. seven of these factors were characterized further to determine a role in lin- <dig> regulation during vulval development. we found that the orphan nuclear receptor nhr- <dig>  the hypodermal fate regulator lin- <dig> and the gata factor elt- <dig> positively regulate lin- <dig> expression in the embryo and may play a role in initiation of lin- <dig> in the vulval lineage. in the larva, nhr- <dig>  lin- <dig>  elt- <dig>  the zinc finger proteins ztf- <dig> and bed- <dig>  and the t box factor tbx- <dig> positively regulate lin- <dig> expression in the vpcs. interestingly, we previously showed that the adjacent gata factor genes egl- <dig> and elt- <dig> are downstream targets of lin- <dig> in the larva vpcs  <cit> . combined with our current result that elt- <dig> binds to and regulates lin- <dig> expression in the embryo, this suggests that egl-18/elt- <dig> and lin- <dig> may form a positive feedback loop to initiate and maintain lin- <dig> gene expression during embryonic and larval life to ensure proper vpc fate specification.

RESULTS
identification of transcription factors that bind to lin- <dig> genomic regions using yeast one-hybrid screens
we previously identified cis and trans-acting factors that regulate lin- <dig> expression in response to rtk/ras signaling in the larval vpcs  <cit> . to further understand hox gene lin- <dig> regulation in c. elegans, we sought to identify transcription factors that bind to and regulate lin- <dig> expression, with an emphasis on 1) regulation in the vulval precursor cells p <dig> p - p <dig> p  and their descendants in the larva, and 2) expression in the precursors to the vpcs, the p cells p <dig> - p <dig>  in the embryo. we used the yeast one-hybrid approach, in which dna sequences from the gene of interest are used as ‘bait’ to screen for factors that can bind these sequences in yeast leading to activation of reporter gene expression  <cit> . previously, in addition to identifying large genomic regions that drove gfp reporter expression in lin-39-expressing cells, we also identified  <dig> short dna elements  located upstream, downstream and in introns that are conserved in lin- <dig> from the species c. elegans, c. briggsae and c. remanei <cit>  . reasoning that some of these evolutionarily conserved regions  may be binding sites for transcription factors that regulate lin- <dig> expression, we used twelve small lin- <dig> genomic regions  that each encompassed one or more ecrs in yeast one-hybrid screens . we also used the element jw <dig> , a 340 bp fragment found  <dig>  kb upstream of lin- <dig> that drives gfp expression in the p cells of the embryo  <cit> , as this fragment may bind factors responsible for initiation of lin- <dig> expression . these thirteen dna fragments, which together represent ~ 13% of the genomic region between lin- <dig> and its neighboring genes, were used as separate ‘baits’ .

the table indicates the  <dig> fragments  used in yeast one-hybrid screens, the evolutionarily-conserved regions  each contains, the size of the fragment used, and the transcription factors identified as binding to each fragment.

we used two yeast one-hybrid assay procedures. one screen was performed by transformation of the thirteen bait strains with a library of  <dig> plasmids that each express one c. elegans transcription factor fused to the activation domain from the yeast transcription factor gal <dig>  <cit> . two other screens were performed using a robotically-assisted mating assay in which the thirteen haploid bait strains were mated to a collection of  <dig> strains, each of which expresses a single c. elegans transcription factor fused to the gal <dig> activation domain  <cit> . factors identified as positive from the primary screens were retransformed manually and tested a second time; only factors that showed a reproducible interaction in yeast were considered true positives. in total,  <dig> interactions were found in yeast between  <dig> transcription factors and eight different fragments : nhr- <dig> , alr- <dig> , and ztf- <dig>  were identified through the library transformation screen, while  <dig> factors were identified via the robotically-assisted mating screens: odr- <dig>  tbx- <dig> and tbx- <dig> ; lin- <dig> ; tbx- <dig>  tbx- <dig> and egl- <dig> ; flh- <dig> and nhr- <dig> ; tbx- <dig> and the protein encoded by b <dig>  ; bed- <dig> and flh- <dig> ; dmd- <dig> and elt- <dig>  .

we describe here our characterization of seven transcription regulators  chosen because these factors had either known expression in lin-39-expressing cells or a phenotype affecting a lin-39-regulated process  <cit> , or because our preliminary data showed an effect on lin- <dig> reporter expression in vivo. for each factor we carried out the following analyses. to validate the yeast interactions we expressed and purified each factor from bacteria and assayed binding to the appropriate sites in vitro . to determine if these factors regulate lin- <dig> expression in vivo in the vulval precursor cells during larval life, we reduced function for each transcription factor and examined lin- <dig> expression using an integrated transcriptional lin-39::gfp reporter  that contains 250 kb of genomic dna around the lin- <dig> locus  <cit>  . we also examined lin- <dig> expression in rnai-treated and mutant animals at the l <dig> stage by qrt-pcr . the strain containing the integrated lin-39::gfp reporter was also used to examine the effects of reduced transcription factor activity on lin- <dig> expression in the embryonic p cells p <dig> - p <dig>  which divide in the larva to generate lin-39-expressing vulval precursor cells and ventral cord neurons  <cit>  . finally, we examined the effect of reduction of factor function in a lin-39-sensitized background on the fusion of the vulval precursor cells at the l <dig> stage . below we describe our results that show that six of the factors identified in the yeast one-hybrid screens regulate lin- <dig> expression in the larval vulval precursor cells, while three of them also regulate lin- <dig> expression in the embryo.

orphan nuclear hormone receptor nhr- <dig> positively regulates lin- <dig> expression in the embryo and larva
the nhr- <dig> gene encodes an orphan nuclear hormone receptor, and nhr-43::gfp reporter expression is present from late embryo to adult in hypodermis, excretory cells, posterior intestine cells, and two head neurons  <cit> . in yeast, nhr- <dig> bound to yf <dig>  a 342 bp fragment located  <dig>  kb upstream of lin- <dig> , and this binding was verified in vitro using nhr- <dig> protein purified from e. coli . some nuclear hormone receptors are known to bind sites containing the sequence tgac  <cit> , and there is a tgac site in yf <dig>  while the wild type yf <dig> sequence competed for nhr- <dig> binding in vitro, the same yf <dig> fragment with the tgac site mutated no longer competed effectively , suggesting that nhr- <dig> may bind to yf <dig> through this putative nhr binding site.

when rnai was performed on worms carrying the lin-39::gfp transcriptional reporter to reduce nhr- <dig> function, their progeny showed a decrease in the number of animals expressing wild type levels of gfp in the vulval precursor cells at the l <dig> stage . qrt-pcr on nhr- <dig> mutant animals  <cit>  at the l <dig> stage also showed a decrease in lin- <dig> expression compared to control animals . we also found that fewer embryos derived from hermaphrodites treated with nhr- <dig> rnai showed lin-39::gfp expression in p <dig> -  <dig> compared to control animals , indicating that nhr- <dig> positively regulates lin-39::gfp in the embryonic p cells. this embryonic defect could explain the reduction in gfp expression in the vpcs in the larva, however a decrease in lin-39::gfp expression was also observed if nhr- <dig> rnai was performed on l <dig> worms and then the same animals were observed in the l <dig> stage  animals showed wild type expression in all vpcs versus 76% of rnai control, p <  <dig> ). in summary, orphan nuclear hormone receptor nhr- <dig> binds to a site located far upstream of the lin- <dig> initiation codon, and nhr- <dig> function is required for wild type levels of lin- <dig> expression in the embryo and larva in cells that will participate in vulval development.

the aristaless homolog alr- <dig> may regulate larval lin- <dig> expression
alr- <dig> encodes a factor homologous to the products of the drosophila aristaless and mouse arx  genes, and antibody staining and gfp reporter analysis have shown alr- <dig> expression in multiple neurons and hypodermal cells from embryo to adult  <cit> . in yeast, alr- <dig> bound to yf <dig>  a 311 bp dna fragment located  <dig>  kb upstream of lin- <dig> containing the evolutionarily conserved sequence ecr <dig> . recently, the modencode project identified genomic binding sites for a number of c. elegans transcription factors, including alr- <dig>  using chromatin immunoprecipitation from larval animals  <cit> . examination of this data shows binding of alr- <dig> to multiple sites in the lin- <dig> promoter region, including the ecr <dig> site. bacterially expressed alr- <dig> protein bound to a 40 bp dna fragment encompassing ecr <dig> in vitro, and this binding was not competed by  <dig> fold excess of an oligonucleotide of the same base composition and length but scrambled sequence . therefore, alr- <dig> binds a site in the upstream region of lin- <dig> in both in vitro and in vivo assays.

we did not observe a significant effect of alr- <dig> rnai on lin- <dig> or lin-39::gfp expression in either the embryo or larva in the cells that will give rise to the vulva . however, we did observe an effect of alr- <dig> rnai on a lin- <dig> mediated process in the larval vpcs. during wild type development, the cells p <dig> p - p <dig> p are born in the l <dig> stage and because they express lin- <dig> they do not fuse with the surrounding hyp <dig> syncytium as more anterior and posterior pn.p cells do  <cit> . later, in approximately 50% of animals, p <dig> p can fuse with hyp <dig> in the l <dig> stage  <cit> . thus wild type animals have either five or six vpcs at the time of vulval induction in the late l <dig> stage. in lin- <dig> mutant animals, or in animals in which wnt signaling is compromised, additional vpcs are seen to adopt this fused fate  <cit> . to examine the role of potential lin- <dig> regulators in this process we used rnai to reduce their function in a sensitized strain containing the hypodermal junction marker ajm-1::gfp and the temperature sensitive mutation lin- <dig> and examined the fusion of the vpcs at the l <dig> stage as before  <cit> . we found an increased number of larva with vpc fusion defects in lin- <dig> alr- <dig> compared to lin- <dig> control animals . therefore, although we were unable to detect an effect of loss of alr- <dig> function on lin- <dig> expression in the vulval cells, we did see a weak effect on a lin- <dig> dependent process, leaving open its role as an in vivo regulator of lin- <dig> expression.

the zinc finger protein ztf- <dig> positively regulates lin- <dig> expression
ztf- <dig> encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, and a ztf-17::gfp transcriptional reporter is expressed in head muscle, pharynx, and the ventral nerve cord  <cit> . in yeast, ztf- <dig> bound to yf <dig>  a 372 bp dna fragment located 2 kb upstream of lin- <dig> that contains ecrs 7– <dig> . to identify a smaller ztf- <dig> binding region, we divided yf <dig> into smaller fragments, and showed by one-hybrid assays that ztf- <dig> interacts with yf4- <dig>  a 110 bp subfragment that overlaps ecr <dig> . in vitro binding and competition assays with bacterially-expressed ztf- <dig> protein validated this result, showing that ztf- <dig> binds to fragment yf4- <dig>  but not the adjacent fragment yf4- <dig> figure 1c and d).

ztf- <dig> rnai performed on lin-39::gfp worms caused a decrease in the number of progeny animals showing wild type levels of lin-39::gfp expression in the vpcs, , and qrt-pcr analysis of these ztf- <dig> animals showed a statistically significant decrease in lin- <dig> at the l <dig> stage . lin-39::gfp expression in the vpc parent cells, p <dig> - p <dig>  was not altered in embryos derived from ztf- <dig> mothers , suggesting that ztf- <dig> may be a larval regulator of lin- <dig> expression. in summary, in vitro and yeast one-hybrid analyses indicate that the zinc finger protein ztf- <dig> binds to a 110 bp fragment located upstream of lin- <dig>  and positively regulates lin- <dig> expression in the vulval precursor cells during larval life.

lin- <dig>  which is required for maintenance of hypodermal cell fates, may positively regulate lin- <dig> expression in the embryo and larva
lin- <dig> encodes a zinc-finger protein which is expressed in all hypodermal cells based on antibody staining  <cit> . in lin- <dig> mutants, cell fate transformations from hypodermal to neuronal fate occur in many cells, including the vpcs  <cit> . lin- <dig> also bound to yf <dig> in the yeast one-hybrid assay , and further analysis showed an interaction with yf4- <dig>  a 103 bp dna fragment that is distinct from the fragment bound by ztf- <dig> . we divided fragment yf4- <dig> into two smaller fragments, and in vitro dna binding and competition experiments showed that lin- <dig> bound to yf4-3- <dig>  a 51 bp dna fragment that does not contain an evolutionarily conserved region .

to assay lin- <dig> regulation of lin- <dig> expression in vivo, lin- <dig> rnai was performed on newly hatched lin-39::gfp larvae and gfp levels in vpcs p <dig> p-p <dig> p were examined at the l <dig> stage in the same animals; this ‘l <dig> feeding’ was performed because of the embryonic lethal phenotype caused by lin- <dig> rnai. lin- <dig> rnai caused a weak but significant decrease in expression of lin-39::gfp in p <dig> p and p <dig> p at the l <dig> stage , and qrt-pcr performed on lin- <dig> mutant animals  <cit>  also showed a small but significant decrease in lin- <dig> at the early l <dig> stage . finally, we investigated lin- <dig> regulation of lin- <dig> in the embryo, and found that fewer embryos expressed lin-39::gfp in the p cells from mothers treated with lin- <dig> rnai, compared to control embryos . consistent with effects on lin- <dig> expression, lin- <dig> performed on newly hatched l <dig> larvae in a sensitized lin- <dig> background caused a defect in vpc fusion at the l <dig> . thus, we have identified a binding site in the lin- <dig> upstream region for the general hypodermal transcription factor lin- <dig>  and our results suggest that lin- <dig> acts to positively regulate lin- <dig> expression in both the embryo and larva.

the t-box protein tbx- <dig> binds in lin- <dig> intron  <dig> and positively regulates larval lin- <dig> expression in the vpcs
tbx- <dig> encodes a t-box transcription factor, and a tbx-9::gfp translational reporter is expressed in lateral and ventral hypodermal cells, intestine and muscle  <cit> . tbx- <dig> mutants have a disorganized body shape beginning in the embryo, which was attributed to defects in hypodermal cells and body wall muscles  <cit> . in yeast, tbx- <dig> bound to yf <dig>  a 257 bp dna fragment located in the large second intron of lin- <dig> that contains ecrs 21– <dig> , and this binding was recapitulated in vitro with purified tbx- <dig> protein . we divided the yf <dig> fragment into four smaller fragments , and found that bacterially purified tbx- <dig> bound best to the 79 bp subfragment c, and that this fragment could also compete for binding of tbx- <dig> to yf <dig> .

to test tbx- <dig> as a regulator of lin- <dig> in vivo, tbx- <dig> rnai was performed on l <dig> lin-39::gfp worms, and we observed a decrease in the number of animals with wild type levels of gfp expression in p <dig> p-p <dig> p in the same animals at the l <dig> stage . qrt-pcr analysis on tbx- <dig> mutant animals  <cit>  also showed a decrease in lin- <dig> levels compared to wild type l <dig> stage worms , and tbx- <dig> performed in a sensitized lin- <dig> background caused a defect in vpc fusion at the l <dig> . tbx- <dig> rnai treatment did not effect lin-39::gfp expression in the cells p5-p <dig> in the embryo . in summary, we found that tbx- <dig> may bind multiple sites within a 257 bp fragment from lin- <dig> intron  <dig>  and tbx- <dig> acts as a positive regulator of lin- <dig> expression in the vpcs in the larva.

the zinc-finger protein bed- <dig> binds to site in lin- <dig> intron  <dig> and positively regulates lin- <dig> expression
bed- <dig> encodes a bed zinc-finger protein that is expressed in most hypodermal cells, including the seam cells and the progeny of the vpcs at the time of l3/l <dig> molt  <cit> . in bed- <dig> mutants, the granddaughters of p <dig> p, p <dig> p and p <dig> p often fail to divide, which suggested that bed- <dig> acts late during vulval induction in the terminal divisions of the induced vpcs  <cit> . in yeast, bed- <dig> bound yf <dig>  a  <dig> base pair fragment from the second lin- <dig> intron that contains ecrs 24– <dig> . bacterially-expressed bed- <dig> protein bound to yf <dig> in vitro, however, we found that bed- <dig> protein also bound to several other unrelated dna fragments, suggesting the purified bed- <dig> protein may show non-specific binding in vitro .

despite our inability to validate the bed- <dig> binding result in vitro, we observed that bed- <dig> rnai caused a strong decrease in the number of animals with wild type levels of lin-39::gfp expression in p <dig> p-p <dig> p at the l <dig> stage , and this decrease was also seen by qrt-pcr analysis on bed- <dig> l <dig> larvae . consistent with the decrease in lin- <dig> expression in vivo, bed- <dig> caused a defect in vpc fusion at the l <dig> in a sensitized lin- <dig> background . however lin-39::gfp expression did not change in embryos derived from mothers treated for bed- <dig> . therefore, although we could not localize a binding site for bed- <dig> beyond the lin- <dig> intron  <dig> fragment used in the yeast screen, our in vivo data indicate that bed- <dig> is likely to function as a positive regulator of lin- <dig> expression in the vulval precursor cells in the larva.

the gata factor elt- <dig> binds to a lin- <dig> enhancer that directs expression in the p cells in the embryo
we previously described a 340 bp cis-regulatory element from lin- <dig> that is sufficient to drive gfp expression in the embryo in p5-p <dig>  cells which divide to generate lin- <dig> expressing vpcs and neuroblasts in the ventral midbody region . a 24 bp sequence  in the pjw <dig>  enhancer is conserved between c. elegans and c. briggsae, and mutation of this site abolished embryonic expression from the pjw <dig>  reporter  <cit> . site s <dig> contains the sequence tgataa, a predicted binding site for a gata family transcription factor, which prefer the motif wgatar  <cit> . intriguingly, we found that the transcription factor elt- <dig> bound to the pjw <dig>  enhancer fragment in our yeast screen . elt- <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid gata transcription factor expressed in certain neurons and hypodermal cells, particularly the seam cells and vpcs  <cit> . we performed directed yeast one-hybrid assays with eight other c. elegans gata factors and found that elt- <dig> was the only gata factor that interacted with the pjw <dig>  enhancer fragment in yeast . when the gata site in pjw <dig>  was mutated in the yeast reporters, elt- <dig> no longer interacted with the dna fragment in yeast . elt- <dig> protein purified from e. coli bound the s <dig> site in vitro, but did not bind when the gata sequence was mutated . elt- <dig> binding to s <dig> was abolished when competed with excess wild type cold s <dig> probe, but when the s <dig> gata site was mutated, the resulting oligonucleotide  competed less well for elt-6/s <dig> binding . when a second gata site at the edge of the 40 bp oligonucleotide was also mutated, the ability of the mutated oligonucleotide  to compete was greatly reduced .

to examine regulation of lin- <dig> expression by elt- <dig> in the embryo, we assayed expression of a reporter construct containing the wild type 340 bp element, pjw <dig> ::gfp, in elt- <dig> mutant animals. gk <dig> is an allele with 457 bp deletion covering the first intron and second exon of elt- <dig> and is a presumed null mutation  <cit> . only 56% of embryos from elt- <dig> mutant animals displayed a wild type pattern of pjw <dig> ::gfp expression, compared to 94% of control embryos . a decrease in the penetrance of expression was also seen in the embryos derived from pjw <dig> ::gfp mothers treated with elt- <dig> rnai . we also examined the effect of reduction of elt- <dig> function on embryonic expression of the large lin-39::gfp reporter that we used to assay other transcription factors. when elt- <dig> rnai was performed on lin-39::gfp hermaphrodites, only 82% of embryos showed the wild type level of gfp expression in p5- p <dig> . taken together, these results indicate that the gata factor elt- <dig> is necessary for proper expression of lin- <dig> in p5-p <dig> in the embryo, most likely via binding to the conserved gata site in the pjw <dig>  enhancer, which was previously shown to be necessary for enhancer driven gfp expression in the embryonic p cells  <cit> ).

the gata factor egl- <dig> also regulates lin- <dig> expression in the p cells in the embryo
the elt- <dig> open reading frame begins less than 600 bp downstream from the end of another gata factor gene, egl- <dig> , and these two genes are transcribed dicistronically in some tissues  <cit> . the dna binding domains of egl- <dig> and elt- <dig> are similar, and the two genes show genetic redundancy during fate specification of the hypodermal seam cells and vpcs  <cit> . in particular, reduction of function for both elt- <dig> and egl- <dig> in the larva causes the vpcs to adopt inappropriate cell fates and fuse with the hypodermal syncytium  <cit> , a phenotype also seen with reduction of lin- <dig> function  <cit> .

although egl- <dig> did not bind to the 340 bp pjw <dig>  fragment in yeast assays , the known functional redundancy of elt- <dig> and egl- <dig> and their dicistronic expression in hypodermal cells led us to test for a role for egl- <dig> in the regulation of lin- <dig> expression. when the pjw <dig> ::gfp reporter was moved into two different egl- <dig> mutant strains, egl- <dig> and egl- <dig> <cit> , we found that gfp expression in p <dig> - p <dig> in the embryo decreased from 94% for control animals to 60% in egl- <dig> and 68% in egl- <dig> . these results suggest that egl- <dig> is also required for proper lin- <dig> expression in the embryo. to test for redundant function in lin- <dig> regulation, we performed rnai for one gene in the background of a mutant for the other . in neither case was there a significant decrease in the number of embryos showing pjw <dig> ::gfp expression compared to the egl- <dig> or elt- <dig> mutant strain treated with control vector . thus we did not obtain evidence for functional redundancy of elt- <dig> and egl- <dig> in regulating pjw <dig> ::gfp expression in the embryo, even though reduction of function for either gene alone affects embryonic gfp expression.

elt- <dig> and egl- <dig> also regulate lin- <dig> expression post-embryonically
we also examined whether elt- <dig> affects lin- <dig> expression post-embryonically. elt- <dig> rnai was performed on lin-39::gfp l <dig> larvae and we observed gfp expression in the vpcs in the same animals at the l <dig> stage. a statistically significant decrease in the number of vpcs  showing a wild type level of lin-39::gfp expression in the vpcs at the l <dig> stage was seen for elt- <dig> animals , indicating that elt- <dig> also positively regulates lin- <dig> in the larval vpcs. egl- <dig> is also likely to regulate lin- <dig> expression postembryonically, since qrt-pcr on animals in which both egl- <dig> and elt- <dig> function is compromised had lower expression of lin- <dig> than elt- <dig> mutant animals alone .

to test the hypothesis that lin- <dig> is a downstream target of elt- <dig> and/or egl- <dig> in the larva, we asked if overexpression of the gata factors could increase lin- <dig> levels. we overexpressed egl- <dig> and elt- <dig> using the heat shock promoter and assayed lin- <dig> levels by qrt-pcr for lin- <dig> one hour after a single heat shock at the l2/l <dig> molt. we found that lin- <dig> levels went up  <dig>  fold when elt- <dig> was over-expressed,  <dig>  fold when egl- <dig> was over-expressed, and  <dig>  fold when both elt- <dig> and egl- <dig> were over expressed , supporting the hypothesis that lin- <dig> is a downstream target of both elt- <dig> and egl- <dig> in the larval vpcs.

discussion
the c. elegans hox gene lin- <dig> functions in the midbody region of the developing c. elegans larva, where it is expressed in the p cells and their descendants, including the hermaphrodite vulval precursor cells   <cit> . during vulval development, lin- <dig> expression is regulated by wnt and ras signaling pathways to facilitate vpc fate specification  <cit> . to further understand the function of lin- <dig> in hermaphrodite vulval development, we wish to identify cis-acting sites and trans-acting factors required for initiation, maintenance and regulated expression of lin- <dig> in the p cells and vpcs. previously, using an enhancerless gfp reporter assay, we identified a lin- <dig> enhancer fragment  that directs expression in the vpc p <dig> p at the time of vulval induction, which responds to ras pathway activity, and which is bound by the ras pathway effectors lin- <dig> and lin- <dig>  as well as by lin- <dig> itself  <cit> . we also identified a lin- <dig> enhancer  that directs expression in the p cells in the embryo and in their larval descendants , and showed that expression in the embryo depended on an evolutionarily conserved site that contains within it a putative gata transcription factor binding site.

here we took a complementary approach to identify additional factors that may regulate lin- <dig> expression during vulval development. we concentrated on  <dig> short, evolutionarily conserved regions  that we previously identified in the lin- <dig> gene in c. elegans, c. briggsae and c. remanei <cit> , on the assumption that some may represent binding sites for phylogenetically conserved transcriptional regulators. we used the yeast one-hybrid technique to identify transcription factors that could bind to dna fragments containing one or more of these ecrs, circumventing the requirement that the dna site be sufficient to direct in vivo reporter expression  <cit> . having found multiple transcription factors that interact with lin- <dig> dna fragments, we looked for effects on endogenous lin- <dig> transcript levels and on expression from a lin-39::gfp reporter in vivo when the function of these proteins was reduced. using this approach we identified six transcription factors that bind lin- <dig> promoter sequences in yeast and in vitro and regulate lin- <dig> expression and/or function in vivo . three factors, the orphan nuclear receptor nhr- <dig>  the hypodermal cell fate regulator lin- <dig> and the gata factor elt- <dig> positively regulate lin- <dig> expression in the embryo. in addition to those three factors, we identified the zinc finger proteins ztf- <dig> and bed- <dig> and the t box factor tbx- <dig> as positive regulators of lin- <dig> expression in the larval vpcs. before this work, only four transcription factors were known to directly bind at the lin- <dig> gene and regulate its expression; lin- <dig>  lin- <dig>  lin- <dig> and tra- <dig>  all of which act during larval life   <cit> . therefore, by this approach combining phylogenetic conservation and yeast one-hybrid screening, we have more than doubled the number of factors known to directly bind to and regulate lin- <dig>  and for the first time we have identified factors that regulate expression of this hox gene in the embryo.

we believe these factors regulate lin- <dig> in vivo because we observed a reproducible change in expression of the full length lin-39::gfp reporter and/or a decrease in endogenous lin- <dig> transcript levels when the function of each of these factors was reduced, and in several cases we observed a phenotype in a lin- <dig> regulated process . given their binding to sites from the lin- <dig> genomic region, the simplest model would be that these factors directly regulate lin- <dig> expression in the cells we examined . however, in the current work we did not pursue in vivo binding studies for any of these factors; although published results from the modencode project show binding of alr- <dig> to the evolutionarily conserved site we identified at the relevant time in development  <cit> . additionally, while existing gfp reporters for four of these proteins  are turned on in some lin-39-expressing cells, expression in the p cells or vpcs has not been directly observed  <cit> . gfp reporters suffer from the caveat that all the elements required to recapitulate endogenous expression may not be present, or the expression may be weak or dynamic. however, until we can verify expression of each transcription factor in the embryonic p cells or larval vpcs, and show evidence of binding to the sites we identified in vivo, it remains possible that some of these factors regulate lin- <dig> indirectly via another transcription regulator, or even act non cell-autonomously on lin- <dig> expression. the strongest case for direct regulation can be made for bed- <dig>  which regulates lin- <dig> expression during larval life, and for lin- <dig> and elt- <dig>  which regulate lin- <dig> expression in the embryonic p cells.

bed-3
bed- <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid zinc finger protein with a bed dna binding domain, and bed- <dig> mutants show an egl- laying  defective phenotype and defects in the terminal cell divisions of the descendants of the vpcs  <cit> . an intronic enhancer element from bed- <dig> directs gfp expression in vpc descendants, leading to the hypothesis that bed- <dig> functions in the terminal cell divisions of vulval cells during vulval induction  <cit> . we found that bed- <dig> showed the strongest effect on full length lin-39::gfp expression in the vpcs; in wild type animals the vpcs p <dig> p - p <dig> p showed lin-39::gfp expression 89% of the time , while in bed- <dig> animals these cells showed gfp expression only 37% of the time. this suggests that bed- <dig> could be acting at an earlier stage in vulval development. consistent with this, we observed that the bed- <dig> enhancer::gfp reporter does show expression in the vpcs before they divide , which would be consistent with bed- <dig> acting upstream of lin- <dig> in the vpcs themselves. therefore, although we could not verify bed- <dig> binding to the yf <dig> site in vitro with purified protein, we believe bed- <dig> is likely to be a positive regulator of lin- <dig> in the larval vpcs before vulval induction, as well as functioning in the subsequent cell division of their progeny, as previously reported  <cit> .

lin-26
lin- <dig> is a  <dig> amino acid zinc finger transcription factor that shows continuous expression in all embryonic and larval hypodermal cells after their birth  <cit> . loss of lin- <dig> causes hypodermal cells to adopt incorrect cell fates or degenerate after their birth, resulting in embryonic lethality  <cit> . ectopic expression of lin- <dig> in the early embryo can induce cells to adopt hypodermal-like fates  <cit> . these results suggest that lin- <dig> is required to specify and/or maintain the hypodermal cell fate  <cit> . lin- <dig> itself is positively regulated by the gata factor elt- <dig>  which is another global regulator of hypodermal cell fate  <cit> . we found that lin- <dig> rnai caused a weak but significant decrease in the expression of the full length lin-39::gfp reporter in the p cells in the embryo; 100% of wild type embryos show gfp expression, compared to 86% of lin- <dig> animals. lin- <dig> binds in vitro to a 51 bp sequence located approximately 2 kb upstream of the lin- <dig> start codon . recent data recording reporter gene expression from live developing embryos shows that a lin-26::mcherry transcriptional reporter shows expression in the mothers of the p cells shortly before they divide, at the same time as these cells also begin to show expression of a lin-39::mcherry reporter  <cit>  . based on these results, and the known function of lin- <dig> in hypodermal cell fate, we propose that lin- <dig> positively regulates lin- <dig> expression in the embryonic p cells, and that the function of this regulation is to aid in initial p cell fate specification and/or to maintain the p cell identity once established.

elt-6
elt- <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid gata family transcription factor. the elt- <dig> gene is immediately downstream from another gata factor gene, egl- <dig> , and reporter gene experiments suggest elt- <dig> may be expressed on its own and as part of a dicistronic message with egl- <dig> <cit> . these genes are expressed in many cells in the embryo, including the descendants of the ms and ab blastomeres . in the larva, they are expressed strongly in the lateral hypodermal seam cells and weakly in the vpcs  <cit> . these two gata factors share 76% identity in their dna-binding domains, and have been shown to act redundantly in seam cell development in both the embryo and larva  <cit> . we previously showed that a 340 bp lin- <dig> enhancer  directs gfp expression in the embryonic p cells, and a conserved gata site in the enhancer was necessary for expression  <cit> . here we identify the gata factor elt- <dig> as binding to this lin- <dig> enhancer in yeast and in vitro, and show that binding was dependent on the gata sequence. elt- <dig> rnai showed a decrease in expression of the full length lin-39::gfp reporter in embryonic p cells, and this result was recapitulated with the pjw <dig>  reporter in elt- <dig> mutant and elt- <dig> embryos. these data suggest that elt- <dig> is required for proper expression of the hox gene lin- <dig> in the embryonic p cells. consistent with this, recent data from live recordings of developing embryos shows that elt- <dig> expression in the mothers of p <dig> - p <dig> begins before lin- <dig> expression is first seen . this is the first example to our knowledge of a phenotype caused by reduction of elt- <dig> function alone. elt- <dig> rnai treatment of newly hatched l <dig> larvae also led to a weak reduction in lin-39::gfp expression in the l <dig> vpcs, and overexpression of elt- <dig> or egl- <dig> increased endogenous lin- <dig> expression in larvae. these results suggest that elt- <dig> and/or egl- <dig> may continue to positively regulate lin- <dig> expression in larval life in the vpcs.

given these results, it is interesting that we previously showed, in collaboration with the rothmann laboratory, that the egl-18/elt- <dig> locus was likely to be a downstream target of lin- <dig> in the larval vpcs  <cit> . in that work an 800 bp enhancer element was identified in intron  <dig> of the egl- <dig> gene that directs gfp expression in the vpcs and their descendants starting in the l <dig> stage. this enhancer contains two hox protein-binding sites that are bound in vitro by lin- <dig> and its binding partner ceh- <dig>  and mutation of one site eliminated enhancer-driven gfp expression. finally, overexpression of egl- <dig> from the heat shock promoter was able to partially rescue vulval defects in lin- <dig> animals. these data led to the model that egl-18/elt- <dig> is a downstream target of lin- <dig> during vulval development.

combining these previous data with our current results, our working model suggests lin- <dig> and elt- <dig> are involved in the initiation of expression of the hox gene lin- <dig> in the p cells in the embryo . lin- <dig> may also be regulated by egl- <dig> at this time, since egl- <dig> mutants had reduced enhancer-driven gfp expression in the p cells, and egl- <dig> protein bound to the pjw <dig>  gata site in vitro . once the fate of these cells is established, a positive feedback loop is established between elt- <dig>  acting via the upstream lin- <dig> enhancer pjw <dig> , and lin- <dig>  acting via the intronic enhancer in egl- <dig> <cit> . we propose that this positive feedback loop helps maintain expression of these genes and the fate of these cells and their descendants, the vpcs, during subsequent embryonic and larval development . interestingly, we have seen another example of lin- <dig> feedback regulation. the zinc finger protein sem- <dig> was previously shown to positively regulate lin- <dig> expression in vpcs  <cit> . we have found that in animals overexpressing either lin- <dig> or lin- <dig> and ceh- <dig>  sem- <dig> expression is decreased, suggesting that feedback mechanisms to decrease lin- <dig> levels when they are elevated may also exist . recent chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments from larvae verify binding of tagged lin- <dig> protein upstream and in introns of both the egl- <dig> and sem- <dig> genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
while much is known about the initiation and regulation of hox gene expression in drosophila and vertebrates, less is known outside of these well-studied groups. our laboratory and others have been studying the expression and function of the hox gene lin- <dig> during vulval development in the nematode c. elegans. we used the yeast one-hybrid  method to identify  <dig> transcription factors that interact with specific regions of the lin- <dig> gene, and further characterized several factors  showing that their function is required for proper expression of lin-39::gfp reporters and endogenous lin- <dig> in vivo. this work greatly expands the number of factors known to directly regulate lin- <dig> expression. given the known caveats of the yeast one-hybrid technique , and our emphasis on characterization of factors with known expression or phenotypes in the vulval cells, it is likely that there are additional factors that regulate lin- <dig> in the embryo and larva that we did not identify in our screens. given the important role of hox genes in patterning the developing metazoan body, it is not surprising that hox gene expression is found to be complicated in those species where it has been examined closely. our results suggest that expression of the c. elegans hox gene lin- <dig> in the p cells and vpcs during vulval development may be regulated by a large number of transcription factors, each making a small contribution to overall lin- <dig> expression on its own. this is consistent with in vivo data from c. elegans showing that the average worm gene is bound by several transcription factors at one time in larval development  <cit> . such a mechanism may ensure a robustness of expression for important developmental regulators like hox genes. transcription factors behaving in this manner would also not be identified in genetic screens, since each makes a small overall contribution to lin- <dig> expression, and feedback mechanisms may exist to compensate for reductions in lin- <dig> transcript levels. finally, for the first time, we have identified factors required for lin- <dig> expression in the embryo , and our results with egl- <dig> and elt- <dig>  combined with our earlier work on lin- <dig> regulation of egl-18/elt- <dig>  hint at a positive feedback mechanism to maintain lin- <dig> expression in the vulval lineages. the identification of lin- <dig>  elt- <dig>  and nhr- <dig> will help us further characterize the mechanisms for the initiation of hox gene expression in the nematode, allowing us to make comparisons across metazoan phyla about the mechanisms utilized to regulate this essential class of developmental regulators.
