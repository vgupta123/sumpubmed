BACKGROUND
the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes are protected by specific chromatin structures called telomeres that are composed of tandemly repeated telomeric dna and proteins. in vertebrates, six specific proteins associate with telomeres having affinity to either single-stranded or double-stranded telomeric dna and they are collectively called shelterin  <cit> . these complex structures are essential for chromosome stability, as they differentiate chromosome ends from dna double-strand breaks   <cit> . they protect chromosome termini from nucleolytic attack and undesirable recombination. telomeres also counterbalance incomplete replication of terminal dna by conventional dna polymerase  <cit> ; cells have evolved specific telomerase reverse transcriptase , which can synthesise telomeric repeats using its own rna template thus ensuring proper telomere length. in general, eukaryotic telomeres are composed of tandem g/c rich repeats that end in a single strand 3' overhang which can fold back and invade the duplex repeats to form the so-called t-loop  <cit> . in the absence of telomerase, telomeres become non-functional, shorten with successive cell divisions, and chromosome termini can fuse as a consequence of de-protection. their fusion is a result of the non-homologous-end-joining  which is the prevailing mechanism of dsb healing in plants. although numerous attempts have been made to assess shelterin counterparts in plants, to date these proteins have not been identified . together with proteins invariantly occurring at the telomeres and providing a telomere "capping" function, many additional protein complexes are regularly found in eukaryotic telomeres. paradoxically, many of these proteins are involved in dna repair or recombination and this seems inappropriate at the telomere ends which should be hidden from recombination events and end-to-end fusions.

over the past decade, an increasing body of data has accumulated on the concerted network of dna repair factors and various protein kinases following the disruption of dna integrity, including noxious extrinsic factors, dna replication errors, checkpoint signalling and, meiotic and somatic recombination. one system that plays an essential role in dna repair, recombination, dna replication as well as in the cell cycle checkpoint activation and telomere maintenance, is the mrn complex . this consists of three subunits . a single nbs <dig> molecule is associated with two dimers of mre <dig> and rad <dig>  the mre <dig> and rad <dig> proteins form a heterotetramer which contains two dna-binding and processing domains that can bridge free dna ends  <cit> . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, this complex comprises subunits mre <dig>  rad <dig>  and xrs <dig>  whereas both proteins, mre <dig> and rad <dig>  share a high homology across various eukaryotes, the xrs <dig> protein has a lower degree of homology with nbs <dig>  which is specific for mammals and plants  <cit> , although a functional homologue of nbs <dig> has been found in schizosaccharomyses pombe <cit> .

in humans, mutation in the nbs <dig> gene leads to the chromosomal instability disorder, nijmegen breakage syndrome  <dig>  besides other clinical hallmarks, this syndrome is associated with enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation and chromosomal instability which leads to early developing cancer even in nbs1+/− heterozygotes  <cit> . murine nbs1+/− heterozygotes are phenotypically normal although complete removal of the nbs <dig> is embryonically lethal in mice  <cit> . accumulating evidence demonstrates that nbs <dig> interacts with telomeres and contributes to their stability, at least in human and mouse cells . direct interaction of nbs1with telomere repeat-binding factor  <dig>  trf <dig>  has been shown for immortalized telomerase negative cells  <cit>  implying that this interaction might be involved in the alternative lengthening of telomeres. moreover, it has been shown by indirect immuno-fluorescence that nbs <dig> co-localise with a shelterin constituent, telomere repeat-binding factor  <dig> , during the s phase in cultured hela cells  <cit> , possibly by modulating t-loop formation. similarly, in mouse embryonal fibroblasts, active recruitment of nbs <dig> to dysfunctional telomeres has been observed  <cit> .

it is known that mre <dig> and rad <dig> together with protein kinases atm and atr, are also essential for proper telomere maintenance in plants . inactivation of arabidopsis rad <dig> or mre <dig> leads to hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation or radiomimetics and reduced plant health and even sterility. in knockout rad <dig> or mre <dig> mutant arabidopsis plants genome instabilities are induced, including chromosome end-to-end fusions  <cit> . absence of rad <dig> led to rapid shortening of telomeres and loss of telomere repeats accompanied by chromosome-end fusions, while in double mutant plants  a synergistic effects of rad <dig> and telomerase on the frequency of bridges have been found  <cit> , demonstrating the dual role of the rad <dig> protein in plants. a homolog of the third mrn constituent, nbs <dig>  has been isolated in the higher plants, arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa <cit> . the nbs <dig> proteins from both plant species were shown to be smaller in size than animal nbs <dig>  but both contained typical domains such as the fha , brct  domain, the mre11-binding domain, and the atm-interacting domain. functional analysis using yeast two-hybrid assay showed that the osnbs <dig> protein interacted not only with plant mre <dig> but also with animal mre <dig>  osnbs <dig> mrna expression was found to be higher in the shoot apex and young flower and atnbs <dig> expression increased when plants were exposed to x-rays  <cit> . cytogenetic analyses showed numerous anomalies including the fragmentation of meiotic chromosomes in atnbs <dig> knockout mutants  <cit> , although on simultaneous inactivation of plant atm.

in this study, we examined the role of nbs <dig> in telomere maintenance in the plant model species arabidopsis thaliana. using plants deficient in both genes, nbs <dig> and tert, we found that plants exhibited severe genomic instability even in early generations. these phenotypes worsened with increasing generations on self-pollination and plants developed serious developmental defects leading to sterility in the 6th generation. by comparing the length of telomeres in double and single mutants we observed accelerated and more frequent telomere shortening in the former.

RESULTS
tert/nbs <dig> mutants displayed severe morphologic developmental defects over increasing generations
we performed a crossing between nbs <dig> and tert homozygous plants. from segregating f <dig> seedlings, wild-type plants, nbs <dig> mutants, two independent tert lines 69– <dig> and 69– <dig>  as well as double homozygotes were selected by genotyping using t-dna-specific and gene-specific primers. two independent tert/nbs <dig> lines were selected for onward analyses, k <dig> and l <dig>  these lines are further referred to as generation  <dig> . upon self pollination, we obtained five consecutive generations, g <dig> to g <dig>  until plants displayed defective morphology , produced infertile seeds , and were incapable of subsequent cultivation. siliques from g <dig> plants, both lines, k <dig> and l <dig>  contained only 12 ±  <dig> seeds with a 45% fertility. although the number of seed pods from g <dig> plants was the same as in g <dig> lines, seeds failed to germinate in either soil or ms agar cultures . by contrast, single tert mutant seeds exhibited no signs of fitness derogation from g <dig> to g <dig> in either line 69– <dig> or 69– <dig> .

genomic instability of tert/nbs <dig> is accelerated in comparison to single tert mutants
we predicted accelerated signs of genome instability in somatic tissues of double homozygotes in comparison with single tert mutants. arabidopsis tert mutants are known to be gradually more and more prone to chromosome fusions due to telomere de-protection in successive generations  <cit>  with massive onset of fused chromosomes from the 6th generation on. in our experiments, fused chromosomes were easily detected as anaphase bridges . we used statistics  <cit>  to compare the frequencies of anaphase bridges. consistent with findings  <cit>  single tert mutants appeared to possess  <dig> % of anaphase bridges  in g <dig> and increased incidence of bridges in g <dig> to  <dig> % . in comparison, double mutants tert/nbs <dig> started to develop mitotic anaphase bridges from the g <dig>  reaching  <dig>  and  <dig> % in lines k <dig> and l <dig> respectively, in generations g <dig> . microscopic inspection disclosed no anaphase bridges in nbs <dig> generations, as in wild-type plants  selected during the genotyping process. 

in g <dig> to g <dig> no anaphase bridges were detected. two independent lines of tert/nbs <dig> double mutants were scored, k <dig> and l <dig>  the 95 % confidence intervals  <cit>  show that no statistical differences exist between the values for lines k <dig> and l <dig> in generations g <dig> to g <dig> 

meiotic defects in tert/nbs <dig> mutants
although microscopic inspection revealed no aberrations in male meiocytes from wild-type plants and nbs <dig> mutants, double mutants  displayed numerous chromosome bridges between bivalents in anaphase i and between univalents in anaphase ii . these bridges were observable in preparations from pollen mother cells from g <dig> on. no other signs of meiotic aberrations were observed. pachytene bivalents were fully aligned and male meiosis ended by morphologic perfect tetrads. pollen viability of tert/nbs <dig> was 100% . from the analysis of tert mutants from g <dig>  among  <dig> individual anaphase i figures scored, both lines 69– <dig> and 69– <dig>  only two contained bridged bivalents . products of male meiosis were apparently normal for tert g <dig> plants . comparing aceto-carmine stained pollen grains in anthers, no differences between genotypes tested were noted and all pollen grains were apparently fertile .

chromosomal fusion points of mutant cells exclusively involve chromosome termini
in order to judge whether terminal or intercalary sites of chromosomes are involved in fusion sites of tert/nbs <dig> mutants, we performed repeated rounds of bicolour fish with chromosome-specific bac probes directly adjacent to arabidopsis telomeres as in  <cit> . on anaphase bridges of tert/nbs <dig> mutants, we almost exclusively found signals from chromosome termini . using fish with a directly labelled pna telomere probe, we detected telomere tracts on a portion of bridges in g <dig> in both lines , k <dig>  and l <dig>  from generation g <dig> on, telomere signals were not detected on the anaphase bridges of the double mutants . this finding can be explained by the shortening of the telomere to an extent not detectable by the in situ hybridization procedure, consistent with our assumption that telomeres of the tert/nbs <dig> mutants shorten considerably faster than these of plants with the knockout telomerase gene only. the anaphase bridges of the tert mutants  also contained fish signals from telomere-adjacent bac probes or chromosome terminal sequences as rdnas . as a rule, fused tert chromosomes contained telomere-specific signals in generations g <dig> and g <dig> . 

k <dig> and l <dig> represent independent lines of tert/nbs <dig> mutants, whereas 69– <dig> and 69– <dig> are two independent tert mutants. nd applies to when no bridged anaphases were available and no fish was performed. in tert/nbs <dig> anaphase bridges were detected from g <dig> on, in both lines; in the majority of fused anaphase bridges telomere signals were detected. nevertheless, from generation g <dig>  telomeric signals were no longer detected. anaphase bridges in tert mutants started to occur from g <dig> in both lines, and in a prevailing manner the bridges bore telomere-specific signals.

from examination of the possible participation of respective chromosome ends forming anaphase bridges in tert/nbs <dig> double mutants, we found a notable bias to fusions of the chromosome  <dig> right arm . this more frequent involvement of 2r chromosome ends in fusions, pertaining exclusively to mutant line k <dig>  was observable from g <dig> throughout g <dig>  in tert mutants, both lines, 69– <dig> and 69– <dig>  and tert/nbs <dig> of the l <dig> line anaphase bridges basically carried random terminal signals.

three sequential fish with chromosome-end specific probes revealed enhanced occurrence of 2r chromosome ends in line k <dig> of the tert/nbs <dig> double mutants. in the sibling line k <dig>  the fusion points were represented by random chromosome-arm interactions. in tert mutants lines 69– <dig> and 69– <dig>  the occurrence of anaphase bridges starts from g <dig> on. although the number of anaphase bridges available for analyses was rather low, cf. figure 3g, only in one case the 2r-2r fusion had been detected. nd - no anaphases available.

telomeres of tert/nbs <dig> plants rapidly shorten and to a greater extent than the tert lines
to assess the overall lengths of telomere tracts in somatic cells of the tert/nbs <dig> mutants, we applied the trf method  to dnas isolated from individual plants of various generations and from both lines, k <dig> and l <dig>  whereas wild-type arabidopsis thaliana of the columbia ecotype possess telomeres with lengths ranging from  <dig> to 5 kb, mutant lines displayed remarkable shortening. when comparing tert and tert/nbs <dig>  the telomeres of the latter shortened markedly faster . in contrast to the wild-type, we found in both mutants banded patterns where individual bands represent individual telomere lengths ranging from  <dig> to 1 kb for both tert and tert/nbs <dig> in g <dig>  with successive generations of plants, the length differences were more apparent, reaching  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb for tert of g <dig> plants, line 69– <dig>  and as little as  <dig>  kb for tert/nbs <dig> g <dig> plants . the trend of the accelerated telomere shortening of tert/nbs <dig> double mutants is also visible when comparing g <dig> to g <dig> plants . homozygous nbs <dig> plants displayed no marks of telomere shortening in the same experiments.

discussion
experimental setup and plant morphology
individual constituents of the mrn plant complex have been stepwise analyzed in recent years. mre <dig> t-dna insertion mutants have been described as having severe impact on plant growth and the fertility of homozygotes  <cit> . similarly, mutant arabidopsis plants with t-dna within a rad <dig> gene were sterile  <cit>  and capable of survival only as in vitro cultures.

in this study, we analyzed the possible role of nbs <dig> in telomere length homeostasis. we used the same arabidopsis mutant line gk-570b <dig> as in  <cit> . t-dna insertion resulted in n-terminal truncated protein lacking functional fha and brct domains, whereas the mre <dig> binding domain was retained. this deficiency did not affect the growth or fertility of the nbs1/nbs <dig> homozygotes , as in  <cit> . homozygous plants deficient in tert gene have been extensively studied  <cit>  and shown to possess no telomerase activity  <cit> . nevertheless, the plants were viable in our experiments and provided fertile seeds over seven generations, similar to  <cit> . by contrast, double homozygous tert/nbs <dig> plants exhibited signs of developmental impairment from the g <dig> generation , accompanied by gradual decline in seed production . although the dwarf g <dig> plants provided seeds, they had no germination capacity .

genomic instability of the tert/nbs <dig> homozygotes
the measure of genomic instability in our experiments was the occurrence of mitotic anaphase bridges . whereas in wild-type plants, anaphase bridges were not detected, yet in double homozygotes tert/nbs <dig> the presence of anaphase bridges was detected from g <dig> on . over the next three seed generations , the percentage of bridged anaphases increased dramatically, reaching almost 40% in g <dig> . comparing the two independent tert/nbs <dig> lines, k <dig> and l <dig>  no difference in frequency of bridges was found . in contrast, tert mutants began to exhibit anaphase bridges in g <dig>  but the proportion remained relatively low:  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig> . since nbs <dig> homozygotes did not display any anaphase bridge under microscopic evaluation, markedly enhanced frequency and accelerated occurrence of anaphase bridges observed in our double homozygotes can only be explained by the synergistic interaction of both deficiencies.

we also detected anaphase bridges in meiotic anaphases of pollen mother cells of the double mutants  while other stages of meiosis were apparently normal. we observed no defective meiosis of single nbs <dig> mutants across any generations studied. employing this identical nbs <dig> mutant but in an atm background, massive defects in early stages of meiosis occurred, implying a role for nbs <dig> in the control of meiotic progression which was independent of atm signaling  <cit> .

fused chromosomes of tert/nbs <dig> entirely involved chromosomal termini
the fusion of chromosomes by the nhej mechanism is a consequence of telomere uncapping and can be the result of random fusions of various replicated chromosomes or the consequence of the fusion of sister chromatids of the same chromosome  <cit> . fish analysis with bac probes originating from chromosomal sites directly adjacent to telomeres of arabidopsis chromosomes revealed that the majority of bridges contained terminal bac signals  and, specifically, no combination of signals from various chromosomes. therefore the prevalent mechanism of chromosomal joining was the fusion of sister chromatids. this is in contrast to tert mutants, where various chromosome termini were randomly recruited to fusions in both lines, 69– <dig> and 69– <dig> . in the sparsely occurring bridges of g <dig> of double homozygotes, we were able to observe clear telomere signals on the bridges in a high proportion  which was in striking contrast to higher generations  where telomere tracts on the anaphase bridges were never detected . in contrast, tert mutants regularly contained traces of telomere sequences, at least in g <dig> and g <dig> . the loss of telomere dna has been noticed on the mitotic bridges of the arabidopsis rad <dig> mutant  <cit> . however, double hetrozygotes tert/rad <dig> frequently contained the telomere repeats  <cit> , thus arguing for two different roles of the rad <dig> in either the de-protection of telomeres or with telomeres already shortened by the absence of tert.

in a number of arabidopsis mutants exhibiting somatic anaphase bridges the participation of either the homologous chromosomes or one-chromatid fusions has frequently been described; this holds for mre11-3/ku <dig> mutant   <cit> , or for atm/tert mutants where a single chromosome end at fusion junctions was also detected  <cit> . similarly, when we tested the feasibility of a sequential fish assay for the assessment of chromosome-end fusions  <cit>  by analyzing g <dig> tert plants, we found that 47% of all identified fusions contained the signal from the same chromosome end. in the present study we describe the prevalent occurrence of the fusion of 2r chromosome ends in the double mutant, line k <dig> . this can be explained by critically shortened 2r-telomere in early generation and by clonal propagation of this impairment through somatic tissues and germlines for succeeding generations. albeit that the cause of the chromosome fusions in these various genetic backgrounds was rather different, a substantial proportion of the fusions of uncapped telomeres were accounted for by sister chromatid interactions.

a possible role of nbs <dig> in the protection of telomeres
we observed an increasing occurrence and higher frequency of anaphase bridges in double homozygotes than in wild-type or single tert mutants. from measuring the overall telomere length using terminal restriction fragment  analysis, we uncovered faster shortening of telomeres from individual chromosomes of the double mutants with respect to tert mutants . at the same time, the length of telomeres in nbs <dig> was unaffected and comparable with that of wild-type plants.

substantial progress in the knowledge of rad <dig> and mre <dig> and their role in the dna repair and telomere biology of arabidopsis has been made while nbs1-related data remain to be collected. from our experiments, we cannot gauge whether the synergism observed is due to a functional shortcoming or existence of a direct physical interaction of nbs <dig> with telomeres in plants. possibly the first direct observation of the co-localization of the nbs <dig> protein with telomeres  was found in hela cells during the s phase of the cell cycle, suggesting a possible role in telomere replication  <cit> . in the same year, interaction of nbs <dig> with trf <dig> proteins was also observed in immortalized telomerase negative cells  <cit> . in experiments with cultured cells isolated from patients with the nbs <dig> syndrome, protein nbs <dig> was implicated as a positive regulator of the telomerase but the question remains as to whether the protein recruits this enzyme to the telomeres  <cit> . using the cre-lox recombination system for the inactivation of trf <dig> and nbs <dig> in mouse embryonal fibroblasts, the recruitment of nbs <dig> to dysfunctional telomeres was found to be cell cycle dependent  <cit> : the nhej was induced during g <dig> through atm-dependent signalling, and, the nhej was repressed in g <dig> via a 5' end-resection mechanism which produced an nhej-incompatible 3' overhang on replicated chromosomes.

in the trf analysis, there were observed two different patterns, smeared signals for both, wild-type and nbs <dig> plants representing various telomere lengths, and a number of individual bands representing single telomeres for plants with shortened telomeres . these discrete bands are hallmarks of telomere shortening  <cit>  and provide evidence that shortened telomeres are clonally propagated in plant tissues and/or consecutive generations. gross developmental defects of arabidopsis plants and abundant end-to-end chromosome fusions in atm/tert mutants prove that all cells in the plant embryo inherit a critically shortened telomere  <cit> . although analyses showed that the short telomere arose as a consequence of a large telomere rapid deletion  event, fish analysis revealed that fused chromosomes exhibited overrepresented single chromosome end. notably, in our tert/nbs <dig> mutants, line k <dig>  we detected overrepresented 2r chromosome ends at the fusion points in all generations analyzed by fish . interestingly, telomere shortening was detected from generation g <dig> , far earlier than end-to-end chromosome fusions were detected in g <dig>  this fact strongly supports the existence of a synergism between nbs <dig> and telomerase metabolism in arabidopsis and excludes the possibility of the consequent effect of nbs <dig> mutation on de-protected telomeres.

we did not address the issue of whether the deficiency of nbs <dig> alone was responsible for the observed phenotypes in double mutants or whether there was a disturbance in the proper assembly of the mrn complex with subsequent impact on the phenotypes. hypomorphic mutation in the nbs <dig> gene in question, results in transcript truncated for the n-terminal portion thus lacking fha and brct domains, whereas the c-terminal domain containing mre11-binding and putative atm-interaction motif sites are retained  <cit> . for this reason, the assembly of the mrn complex seems to be unaffected. the existence of phosphopeptide binding domains within the fha and brct motifs in functional nbs <dig> renders multiple interactions with a plethora of proteins requiring phosphorylation to function in dna-damage repair or telomere maintenance  <cit> . thus, the dysfunction of the nbs <dig> can be entailed to the missing fha/brct domain.

CONCLUSIONS
direct physical contact/presence of nbs <dig> on telomeres and their function in telomere maintenance has been substantiated in the case of humans but not in plants. understanding here is hampered by the fact that no shelterin counterparts had been described in plants to date. with our research we now provide indirect evidence of mutual interactions between nbs <dig> and telomeres. it is still unclear at this time whether protein truncation at the n-terminal domain is responsible for the phenotypes observed in tert/nbs <dig> mutants or if the disruption of certain unknown telomere-protecting pathways is responsible.
