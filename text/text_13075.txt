BACKGROUND
spermatogenesis is a process during which undifferentiated germ cells develop into mature sperm cells. a sperm cell has a highly condensed nucleus and lacks many organelles, such as ribosomes and golgi apparatus; thus, sperm is transcriptionally and translationally quiescent  <cit> . early observations that rnas exist in sperm were originally dismissed  <cit> ; however, over the past decade, the view that sperm contains complex rna populations, including mrnas and non-coding rnas, has become established  <cit> . these rna populations contain not only non-functional remnant spermatogenesis-expressed transcripts, but also rnas with potential functions during early embryogenesis  <cit> . recently, the rapid development of microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies has assisted the profiling of sperm rnas in a broad range of species, including human  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , invertebrates  <cit>  and plants  <cit> .

the germline of caenorhabditis elegans is transparent, and is well suited for cellular characterization of spermatogenesis  <cit> . the transcription of sperm genes is initiated during the pachytene stage; when spermatocytes enter the karyosome stage, global transcription ceases  <cit> . in c. elegans, approximately  <dig> genes that are essential for normal spermatogenesis have been characterized  <cit> . by microarray analyses, reinke et al. identified sets of genes that are spermatogenesis-enriched, oogenesis-enriched and sex-regulated  <cit> . notably, their analyses showed that the sperm-enriched genes encode considerable numbers of kinases and phosphatases, and are depleted from the x-chromosome, echoing the findings of reuben et al. that the x-chromosome in males exhibits striking h3k <dig> methylation  <cit> . these microarray analyses identified sperm genes on a large-scale; however, the analyses were based on comparisons between germ cell mutants, and purified sperm cells were not used. in addition, their microarray analyses only identified sperm-enriched genes, while omitted those sperm genes that are also abundant in oocyte.

compared with sperm genes, the c. elegans sperm small rnas have been investigated more extensively. a few studies reported deep sequencing of the small interfering rnas  of spermatogenic cells  <cit> . it was demonstrated that the eri-1/rrf-3/alg- <dig> pathway is essential for production of the spermatogenesis-specific 26g endogenous sirnas   <cit> . han et al. also showed that 26g endo-sirnas regulate spermatogenic gene expressions  <cit> .

in the present study, we purified highly pure c. elegans sperm cells and applied high-throughput approaches to obtain sperm transcriptome and proteome. a large number of long or intermediate-sized non-coding rnas  are found in sperm transcriptome, implying the important roles of lncrnas during spermatogenesis. we showed that sperm proteome/transcriptome is enriched in not only kinase and phosphatase proteins/genes as previously reported  <cit> , but also ion binding proteins/corresponding genes, underlying the crucial roles of intracellular ions in sperm. our extensive rnai screening of sperm genes did not produce many defective phenotypes. our further analysis revealed a tight correlation between sperm transcriptome and sperm small rnaome, which leads to a view that the phenomenon of inefficient rnai screening might result from the endogenous rnai pahway that acts strongly during spermatogenesis and is to compete over the exogenous rnai pathway.

RESULTS
sequencing c. elegans sperm transcriptome and proteome
we performed large-scale culturing of c. elegans strain him- <dig>  followed by isolating males and purifying sperm, and obtained highly pure sperm cells. these cells contain nearly no residue bodies or primary spermatocytes, as examined by microscope . to further examine the purity of acquired sperm, these concentrated sperm as well as the whole worms were subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies against tubulin and h3k <dig> mono-methylation mark. trace h3k <dig> methylation mark has been detected in mammalian sperm  <cit> ; here, we show c. elegans sperm retain histone methylation mark . in contrast, tubulin which is not transmitted to mature sperm is not detected in our prepared sperm . this suggests the purified sperm cells were of high purity.

rna was extracted from these cells, followed by cdna synthesis and amplification, and the purified cdna was deep sequenced on a  <dig> gs flx titanium platform. high-throughput sequencing produced  <dig>  high quality  reads with an average length of  <dig> base-pairs  . these hq sequences were filtered to remove repeat, trnas, rrna, snorna and snrna sequences , and then assembled by newbler  using the c. elegans coding sequence dataset  as a reference, and  <dig>  coding transcripts were identified . the sequences unmapped to the c. elegans coding transcriptome were further assembled using the c. elegans genome as a reference to identify possible non-coding transcripts . in summary, the majority of the sequences  are coding transcripts, and  <dig> % of the sequences were identified as non-coding transcripts . a small part of these non-coding sequences  are predicted to have coding potential by cpat  . in the non-coding portion, many novel transcripts supported by overlapping reads were identified . meanwhile, although the sequencing depth is limited, we did find a few new splicing isoforms, e.g., the asterisks in figure 2e,f point to the introns covered by reads indicating the introns can be transcribed.

we further assessed the level of possible contaminations for sperm transcriptome by examining  <dig> somatic marker genes  for their abundances in the trancriptome dataset. only five  were detected in sperm transcriptome, and the number of reads for these five genes ranged only from  <dig> to  <dig>  thus, somatic cell contamination is much low in the prepared sperm cells. the rpkm  values for these five genes range from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig>  to obtain a higher confidence transcriptome dataset, we set the rpkm cut-off to  <dig> e- <dig>  the resultant sperm transcriptome dataset contains  <dig>  genes  and our following analyses are based on these  <dig>  genes.

in parallel with sperm mrna sequencing, sperm protein extract was prepared and separated on sds-polyacrylamide gel prior to removal of the msp fraction. subsequently, the protein extract was processed for shotgun lc-ms/ms analysis. lc-ms/ms analysis identified  <dig>  peptides, corresponding to  <dig>  proteins in the c. elegans protein dataset , with a probability >95% using percolator scores . none of the above-mentioned somatic cell markers were detected in this proteome dataset.  <dig> proteins  were degenerative .

next, we compared sperm transcriptome and proteome . the result showed that  <dig> % of the transcriptome overlaps with  <dig> % of the proteome . the limited overlap between the two–omes might suggest the different compositions of sperm transcriptome and proteome. alternatively, it may results from the insufficient sequencing depth. when using rpkm and empai  values to evaluate mrna and protein abundances, we found that in the overlapping portion, mrna and protein abundances are significantly correlated  . the overlapping portion contains the most abundant non-msp sperm genes/proteins.

validation of novel lncrnas
as mentioned above, sperm transcriptome comprises ~10% of non-coding rnas. it has been proposed that over 26% and 13% of the full-length cdnas in human and mice, respectively, are mrna-like ncrnas  <cit> . in drosophila, some lncrnas are thought to be important for male-specific processes  <cit> . therefore, we selected  <dig> lncrna candidates that have poly tail from sperm transcriptome and verified them by 3′race. eight novel lncrnas  were successfully validated by 3′race , and spnc <dig> was expressed specifically in males .

recently, nam et al. identified ~ <dig> polyadenylated lncrnas in c. elegans, and many of these lncrnas are predicted to be associated with male identity and sperm functions  <cit> . thus, we compared these lncrnas with the non-coding portion of our sperm transcriptome dataset by blast .  <dig> lncrnas were found in sperm transcriptome, and linc- <dig> was shown to be male-specific . together, these results suggest that apart from coding genes, substantial numbers of lncrnas are expressed and may play functional roles during spermatogenesis.

sperm are enriched in ion binding proteins
by microarray analysis, reinke et al. identified hundreds of hermaphrodite and male germline genes; the hermaphrodite germline genes were further classified as sperm-enriched, oocyte-enriched and germline-intrinsic groups  <cit> . these gene sets were compared with our sperm transcriptome data. the comparison showed that sperm transcriptome overlaps with  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the hermaphrodite and male spermatogenesis gene sets, respectively; in contrast, this sperm transcriptome covers only  <dig> % and 28% of the oogenesis-enriched and germline-intrinsic gene sets, respectively . this result shows a consistency of our sperm transcriptome data with previous microarray analysis. we were particularly interested in the hermaphrodite and male sperm genes identified in both studies . gene ontology  analysis of the two sperm gene sets showed that sperm significantly enrich in kinase/phosphatase  activities and ion binding activity  . kp has been linked to sperm function in c. elegans <cit> ; however, enrichment of the genes encoding ion binding proteins was not reported previously. because cl-, na+, k+ and ca2+ channels were implicated to modulate sperm function  <cit> , ion binding proteins may play crucial roles in post-translational regulation in sperm. we also performed go analysis of the whole sperm transcriptome, and the result resembles the above go analysis: sperm are significantly enriched in phosphatase and ion binding activities  . additionally, go analysis of the sperm proteome confirms that kps and ion binding proteins are three most enriched classes in sperm . in contrast to kps and ion binding activities, transcription factor activity and signal transducer activity are significantly low in sperm  , verifying the transcriptionally and translationally quiescent nature of sperm.

we also reasoned the transcriptome dataset has deeper depth than previous microarray data, thus we employed rt-pcr and used the germ cell mutants fem- <dig>  fem- <dig> and fog- <dig> to screen for novel sperm specific/enriched genes. the expression of the genes with rpkm above  <dig>   in sperm transcriptome was surveyed in these mutants , and  <dig> genes that represent 56% of the genes investigated were shown to be sperm-specific/enriched . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were not defined to be spermatogenesis-enriched in previous microarray analysis . expression of the  <dig> genes is mostly detectable in both males  and hermaphrodites , suggesting that they play common roles in the sperm of both sexes. in this screen, we identified sperm-specific/enriched genes in so high efficiency, demonstrating the sperm transcriptome data serves as a valuable resource for studying spermatogenesis.

sperm gene/protein abundance exhibits a skewed distribution
when examining sperm mrna/protein abundance , we found that the majority of sperm mrnas/proteins have very low abundance, whereas a small set of mrnas/proteins are hugely enriched in sperm . we should note that biased expression for male-enriched genes has been observed in zebrafish  <cit> , fly  <cit> , and recently in c. elegans <cit> . these results indicate that sperm may only rely on a small number of proteins to complete their post-translational regulations, e.g., signalling cascades regulating sperm activation, motility and interaction with oocyte.

rnai analysis of sperm enriched genes
to explore the functions of sperm genes, we firstly tested the rnai of  <dig> genes that have read counts above  <dig> using the rrf-3;him- <dig> strain. most of the rnai-treated hermaphrodites had normal fertility. to examine the fertility of the rnai males, we crossed them with spe-8;dyp- <dig> hermaphrodites. the crossing progenies were also normal , suggesting that the sperm of these males had no defect. we identified only one gene, act- <dig>  whose knockdown leads to a significantly reduced brood size , as shown in figure 8g. act- <dig> was previously shown to be expressed in spermatheca  <cit> . this actin is possibly involved in the contraction of spermatheca.

we further tested the rnai of  <dig> genes that have read counts above  <dig> using the strain pie-1::gfp::h2b at 25°c . rnai was conducted over three generations  <cit> . however, our rnai assay did not produce as many defective phenotypes as those collected from the wormbase rnai dataset. we describe five unreported genes that control fertility as below. first, rnai for the gene ogdh- <dig> or asb- <dig> resulted in complete sterility. ogdh- <dig> is a mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. ogdh- <dig> rnai worms had severe germline defects without germ cells being produced . asb- <dig> is the subunit of a mitochondrial atpase. asb- <dig> rnai worms failed to produce living embryos and its germline growth was retarded when compared with the rnai control . the dissected germline of some asb- <dig> rnai worms evidently lacked sperm . moreover, rnai for the genes nspd- <dig>  f22b <dig>  and k09e <dig>  led to production of unfertilized oocytes . the brood sizes of the rnai worms for these three genes were significantly reduced when compared with that of rnai control  . the observation of unfertilized oocytes in the uterus of rnai worms as well as reduced brood sizes hints that these genes are involved in spermatogenesis.

collectively, our rnai screen identified a few genes that regulate germline development and sperm fertility. it is worth noting that our study, consistent with prior studies, showed that downregulation of sperm genes by rnai feeding approach is inefficient to produce defective phenotypes  <cit> .

endo-rnai pathway represses sperm gene expression
regarding to the phenomenon that rnai of sperm genes produces fewer defective phenotypes than the corresponding mutants, we speculated it is due to that the exogenously triggered rnai pathway could not compete over the endogenous rrf-3/eri-1/alg- <dig> rnai pathway. the competition of these two rnai pathways has been proposed  <cit> . supporting this hypothesis, mutants lacking rrf- <dig> and eri- <dig> have been successfully used as tools for enhanced rnai screening. when comparing our sperm transcriptome data with the published sperm primary sirnas data  <cit> , we did find the sperm 19g-28g primary sirnas have a strong correlation with sperm transcriptome; i.e., for the sperm-enriched mrnas, the corresponding antisense sirnas are also enriched . this result further supports the previous view that the endo-sirna pathway represses the expression of sperm genes  <cit> .

we also examined the expressions of the  <dig> sperm specific/enriched genes  between him- <dig> and him-5;rrf- <dig> adult worms  by rt-pcr . notably, of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were expressed at elevated levels in the him-5;rrf- <dig> as compared with him- <dig> . this expression elevation is particularly evident for worms grown at restrictive temperature . this result demonstrated that rrf- <dig>  as a vital component of the endo-sirna pathway, negatively regulates the expression of sperm genes. together, we propose that the inefficient rnai of sperm genes might result from the competition between exogenous rnai and endogenous rnai pathways during spermatogenesis .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the sperm cell has highly condensed nucleus packed with protamines instead of histones and lacks many essential organelles, such as ribosomes and golgi apparatus  <cit> . therefore, sperm cell is devoid of transcriptional and translational activities. the long assumed view was that, at fertilization, sperm transmits solely its dna to the oocyte, which has all the components necessary for early embryonic development. however, this notion has been changed by recent advancement of high-throughput technologies that made the unravelling of the sperm transcriptome and epigenome possible. it was discovered that sperm not only retains the histones that may play significant roles during early embryogenesis  <cit> , but also contains complex rna species, including mrnas and non-coding rnas, some of which are vital for early embryonic development  <cit> . c. elegans is an easily manipulated model organism, and is ideal to study sperm biology. by microarray analysis, reinke et al. identified spermatogenesis, oogenesis and sex-regulated genes in c. elegans <cit> . to improve study of spermatogenesis, here, we isolated highly pure sperm cells and obtained sperm transcriptome and proteome by high-throughput approaches.

first, sequencing sperm transcriptome showed that considerable numbers of lncrnas are present in sperm. lncrnas are a major group of ncrnas whose functions are poorly understood. in drosophila, some lncrnas were thought to be involved in male-specific processes related to sexual dimorphism  <cit> . recently, nam et al. showed that, in c. elegans, many lncrnas are associated with processes such as dauer formation, male identity, sperm formation, and interaction with sperm-specific mrnas  <cit> . in our small-scale screen, eight novel lncrnas were isolated, one of which was specifically expressed in males.

we showed that sperm gene sets are significantly enriched in not only kinase/phosphatase genes as previously reported  <cit> , but also genes encoding ion binding proteins. sperm development is regulated posttranslationally. the cl-, na+, k+ and ca2+ ion channels have been implicated to respond to extracellular signals and mediate sperm activation  <cit> . therefore, our identification of the sperm genes encoding ion binding proteins will help uncover the intracellular ion regulated pathways associated with sperm function.

we showed that sperm genes or proteins have skewed abundance, i.e., a small set of genes/proteins are greatly enriched in sperm. this supports previous observations that male-enriched genes have biased expressions than female-enriched genes in zebrafish  <cit> , fly  <cit>  and c. elegans <cit> . this result may suggest that compared with somatic cells, sperm only require a small number of proteins to complete their post-translational regulations, e.g., signalling factors for sperm activation, msp dynamics and interaction with oocyte.

by rnai of hundreds of sperm-enriched genes, we identified a few genes, whose knockdown leads to production of unfertilized oocytes and significantly reduced brood size. it is worth noting that previous study showed that rnai of sperm genes is inefficient for producing defective phenotypes  <cit> . to our knowledge, the mechanism behind this phenomenon has been unclear. it could be caused by the low penetrance of rnai to germline tissue. because endo-rnai pathway strongly acts during spermatogenesis  <cit> , here, we presume that this phenomenon might result from the competition between endogenous and exogenous rnai pathways. the endogenous rnai pathway may compete over the exogenous rnai pathway, leading to the failure of rnai of sperm genes.
