BACKGROUND
within the natural environments, crop plants are continuously confronted with different potential pathogens and pests because of their sessile characteristics. as a result, they have evolved complicated defense mechanisms to protect themselves from these pathogenic microorganisms. these include hypersensitive reaction , increased expression of defense related genes, and the oxidative burst  <cit> . the well-studied plant defense mechanism is the host resistance mediated by the products of plant resistance  genes. up to date, large numbers of r genes have been identified and isolated from major crop species such as wheat , rice  and maize   <cit> . the majority of these plant r genes encode proteins containing a central domain with a nucleotide binding site  and a carboxyterminal domain consisting of a series of degenerated leucine-rich repeat  residues. all of the isolated crop r genes reported so far confer resistance to a narrow spectrum of resistance to a small number of pathogen races in a gene-for-gene manner. this kind of race specific resistance is normally short-lived in agricultural utilization resulting from either loss or alteration of avirulence gene products in the fast evolving pathogens  <cit> .

although highly effective in controlling many diseases, host resistance mediated by r genes does not exist in some other cases in any specific host plant species. for example, xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  and xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola  are two highly related pathogens of rice  that constrain rice production in large rice growing areas of asia and africa. the former causes bacterial blight by invading rice vascular tissues and the latter causes bacterial leaf streak by colonizing plant parenchyma. tremendous progress has been made in breeding for resistance to xoo in rice by using one or more of the identified  <dig> r genes  <cit> . to xoc, however, no resistance controlled by single r genes has been identified in rice, even though a few quantitative trait loci for resistance to bacterial leaf streak have been reported  <cit> .

non-host resistance refers to the immune responses of all members of a plant species to all members of a given pathogen species  <cit> . there have been increasing interests in non-host resistance because of its potential use in disease control of heterologous plant species. a successful case in this area was the cloning of a maize r gene, rxo <dig> and demonstration of its function in conferring hr to xoc in transgenic rice  <cit> . rxo <dig> is a dominant nbs-lrr type r gene identified in maize. the transgenic rice lines with cloned rxo <dig> exhibited a distinct hr symptom when inoculated with xoc  <cit> , demonstrating that certain r genes can be effectively transferred between distantly related cereals.

although significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of r gene mediated defenses against pathogens in plants, much less is known about the non-host r gene- pathogen defense responses in heterologous plants. in this paper, we report the use of the affymetrix genechip system to identify genes that are differentially regulated during incompatible and compatible interactions between rxo <dig> and xoc in a near isogenic pair of transgenic and non-transgenic lines in the  <dig> background. our results elucidated some interesting molecular mechanisms underlying rice resistance to xoc mediated by the non-host nbs-lrr maize r gene, rxo <dig> 

RESULTS
phenotypic reactions of 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> to xoc
a susceptible chlorotic symptom was visible as soon as  <dig> days post-inoculation  on the inoculated flag leaves of  <dig> plants, and then the water-soaked lesions began to spread along the pricked sites  <dig> dpi . at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> had an average lesion length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm with masses of bacteria accumulated on the lesion surfaces . the lesions expanded further on the inoculated leaves of  <dig>  <dig> dpi . in contrast, the transgenic 9804-rxo <dig> plants were resistant to xoc, showing typical lightly brown edges around the pricked sites and restricted necrotic lesions on the inoculated leaves  <dig> dpi  with an average lesion length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm at  <dig> dpi. the resistance phenotype of the 9804-rxo <dig> was more apparent at  <dig> dpi with the typical ring-shaped necrosis surrounding the infection sites . lignin histochemical staining revealed that when compared with susceptible  <dig>  lignin deposition occurred to a great extent in the distinctly thickened hydathodes and xylem walls of the infected leaves of the resistant 9804-rxo <dig> plants within  <dig> h , an indication of hr  <cit> .

quantitative differences in gene expression between 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> after in response to inoculation with xoc
we detected  <dig> and  <dig> differentially regulated genes  in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig>  <dig> dpi using a combined criterion of more than two-fold change in expression and a p value <  <dig>  in t tests. the difference between 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> in expression patterns of these up- or down-regulated genes was more striking. of the  <dig> and  <dig> up-regulated genes in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> induced by xoc, only  <dig> genes were in common between the transgenic line and its recipient. similarly, of the  <dig> and  <dig> down-regulated genes in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> induced by xoc,  <dig> genes were commonly repressed in both the transgenic line and its recipient . in particular, we detected  <dig> genes which were regulated in opposite directions between 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig>  including  <dig> genes up-regulated in 9804-rxo <dig> but down-regulated in  <dig> and  <dig> genes down-regulated in 9804-rxo <dig> but up-regulated in  <dig>  respectively.

fig.  <dig> shows all drgs classified into different functional categories according to gene ontology analysis using fatigo http://fatigo.bioinfo.cipf.es combined with uniprot http://www.uniprot.org identified in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig>  9804-rxo <dig> had many more genes involved in cellular processes and post translation modification significantly up-regulated, while most up-regulated genes in  <dig> belong to the function categories of abiotic stress response, defense response and disease resistance, metabolism and transport . interestingly, of the small number of drgs that were commonly regulated in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> , the up-regulated genes belong to functional groups of abiotic stress responses, cellular process and cell wall biogenesis, defense responses, disease resistance and redox regulation, while the down-regulated ones were mainly involved in transcription regulation and signal transduction.

fig.  <dig> shows the rt-pcr profiles of a selected group of  <dig> drgs of different categories identified in the microarray experiment. the rt-pcr results confirmed the microarray results with regard to the expression patterns of all selected genes in the infected leaves of 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> 

differential expression of transcription factors  in 9804-rxo <dig> and 9804
the infection of xoc resulted in diferential expression of  <dig> and  <dig> tf genes in most tf families  in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> , but most of differentially expressed tfs were different in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> except for six tf genes . in addition, three tfs  showed opposite expression patterns in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> in response to the infection of xoc.

of these differentially regulated tfs detected, we detected  <dig> and  <dig> tf genes of the wrky family in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig>  respectively , of these three genes, oswrky <dig> , oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig>  were commonly induced by xoc in both lines. one gene, oswrky <dig>  was significantly down-regulated in 9804-rxo <dig>  but highly up-regulated in  <dig>  this gene plus the remaining  <dig> differentially regulated wrky tfs, including  <dig>  detected in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig>  in  <dig> may have played an important role in mediating the resistance reaction of 9804-rxo <dig> to xoc.

the second group of interesting tf genes included several iaa responsive genes that were significantly repressed in either or both lines under the infection of xoc , plus osarf <dig>  which was induced only in 9804-rxo <dig>  the former group included osiaa <dig> which was down-regulated by xoc in both lines; os06g <dig> and osarf <dig> that were repressed only in 9804-rxo <dig>  and six other genes  that were repressed only in  <dig>  distinct expression patterns of these auxin responsive genes 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> indicated that they may have played important roles in both resistant and susceptible reactions of rice to xoc.

specific groups of genes possibly related to post-transcription regulation in the rxo <dig> mediated resistance to xoc reaction
we detected several other groups of drgs in this study that might be related to rxo <dig> mediated resistance in rice to xoc. the first group included  <dig> drgs functionally classified as post-transcription regulation. of these,  <dig> putative genes encoding pentatricopeptide repeat  were differentially regulated specifically in the infected 9804-rxo  <dig> plants, and strikingly,  <dig> of them were significantly up-regulated. an additional group of  <dig> genes encoding rna recognition motif  proteins were all highly induced in 9804-rxo <dig> under the xoc infection .

to identify the common cis-elements of the drgs coding for ppr, we searched the cis-regulatory elements in the  <dig> kb regions upstream of these drgs using weederwin <dig>  software. three unique sequences: aactggac, gaaactgg and aactgg, were found specifically enriched in the upstream of  <dig> up-regulated ppr genes . in most cases, the three motifs locate between - <dig> to - <dig> bp upstream of the atg start codon of the ppr genes. further analyses revealed a g-box, aactgg, within the cis-element in the promoter fragments of these genes, which is known as the binding  site to a ja-responsive myc <dig> transcription factor  <cit> , indicating that these ppr genes may have been involved in the ja mediated disease responses.

drgs involved in hr in 9804-rxo <dig> under the infection of xoc
because 9804-rxo <dig> showed the same hr phenotype to the infection of xoc as that mediated by most r genes in host plants, we expect that rxo <dig> must be able to trig expression of genes involved in hr. indeed, large numbers of genes involved in calcium ion fluxes and oxidative burst were uniformly up-regulated in the infected 9804-rxo <dig> plants compared with those in  <dig> of our microarray data . specifically,  <dig> genes associated with calcium ion fluxes were significantly up-regulated in 9804-rxo <dig>  including calcium-transporting atpase  <dig> , calcium-dependent protein kinase , and calmodulin . the expression patterns of the  <dig> genes were further confirmed by rt-pcr . four other genes associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species during hr were specially up-regulated in 9804-rxo <dig>  including amine oxidase , vacuolar h+-pyrophosphatase , respiratory burst oxidase  <dig> , and flavin-containing monooxygenase family protein .

a third group of  <dig> genes possibly associated with pcd were differentially expressed in infected 9804-rxo <dig> leaves . of these  <dig> were significantly up-regulated, including genes of the nb-arc domain, ankyrin repeat protein acd <dig>  and genes encoding proteins of the ankyrin repeat family. the nb-arc domain is a novel protein motif shared by many important plant and animal proteins which activate cell death  <cit> . table  <dig> shows  <dig> nb-arc domain containing protein genes that were differentially expressed in the infected leaves of 9804-rxo <dig>   <dig> of which were significantly up-regulated.

inoculation of 9804-rxo <dig> with xoc also specifically up-regulated  <dig> genes, including four ankyrin repeat family proteins or ankyrin protein kinases genes , two genes  of putative hypersensitive-induced response proteins, a protein homologue prmc <dig> , the death-associated protein kinase  <dig>  and a ribosome inactivating protein  gene , and repressed a gene encoding the cell death suppressor protein lls <dig> homolog . all these genes were previously reported to play key roles in the hypersensitive cell death reaction, biotic and abiotic stress-related biological processes  <cit> . the expression patterns of  were confirmed by rt-pcr . we noted that only  <dig> hr related genes  showed the same expression patterns in both 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig>  the former was up-regulated in both lines and the latter was down-regulated in both lines .

drgs involved in sa/ja/et signaling pathways
inoculation of xoc resulted in identification of several drgs involved in sa-, ja- and et-dependent signaling pathways in 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig>  for example, two genes, osnpr <dig>  and oswrky <dig>  involved in the sa pathway  <cit> , were specifically up-regulated in 9804-rxo <dig>  three additional sa-responsive pr genes encoding pathogenesis-related protein  <dig> precursor , pr protein  <dig>  and pr bet/v <dig> family protein  were  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold up-regulated in the infected 9804-rxo <dig> . in contrast, the expression of the five genes didn't show any change in the xoc infected  <dig> plants. we further examined the timing expression patterns of osnpr <dig>  and ospr <dig> precursor  in 9804-rxo <dig> using real-time pcr. these two genes were induced in both 9804-rxo1and  <dig> at  <dig> dpi, but the expression level of the two genes were much higher in the infected 9804-rxo <dig> plants than that in the infected  <dig>  and increased gradually in the infected 9804-rxo <dig> from  <dig> dpi to  <dig> dpi. in contrast, the expression of osnpr <dig> and ospr <dig> genes in the infected  <dig> plants remained relatively stable at a very low level.

in addition, several drgs related to the ja and et signaling pathways were also identified. these included three genes encoding ethylene-responsive factor-like protein  <dig> , ethylene-responsive transcription factor  <dig> , ethylene receptor , which were highly  up-regulated in the 9804-rxo1plants by xoc. however, a small set of genes related to ethylene biosynthesis  and ethylene signaling pathway  were detected up-regulated only in the infected  <dig> plants. two additional genes  encoding jasmonate-induced protein functioning in the ja signaling pathway were significantly up-regulated by the xoc attack in both rice lines.

discussion
non-host resistance is rarely studied since this form of resistance is generally thought to be genetically complex and the activation of any specific defense component may not be sufficient to render a plant resistance reaction  <cit> . there is growing evidence that single non-host r genes can activate complex defense processes such as hr in heterologous host plants in response to specific host pathogens, resulting in similar resistance phenotype governed by host r genes . however, this process remains poorly understood at the molecular level. to answer this question, we analyzed the genome-wide responses in gene expression of the transgenic rice line carrying a non-host maize r gene, 9804-rxo <dig> and its recipient  <dig> to a bacterial pathogen of rice, xoc. the difference between 9804-rxo <dig> and  <dig> in this aspect revealed some interesting aspects on the molecular mechanisms underlying the non-host resistance of rice mediated by the maize r gene, rxo <dig> 

first, the non-host maize r gene, rxo <dig>  was able to induce the differential expression of large numbers and diverse categories of genes in the heterologous rice plants, 9804-rxo <dig>  but not in  <dig> under the infection of xoc. this clearly indicates that the maize r gene was involved in the early steps of the interaction between rice and xoc.

second, consistent with the hr phenotype of 9804-rxo <dig> to xoc, our results that numerous genes associated with each step of hr were specifically up-regulated in the infected 9804-rxo <dig>  in particular, the specific group of wrky tf genes induced only in 9804-rxo <dig> are known to be involved in hr of plants  <cit> . in particular,  <dig> ap <dig> tf genes were uniquely differentially expressed in 9804-rxo <dig>  suggesting their involvement in the hr of the transgenic rice plants mediated by rxo <dig>  thus, our results strongly suggest some common molecular mechanism of rxo <dig> and typical host r genes in mediating hr in rice. however, we noted that there was no change in the expression level of ndr <dig> and pbs <dig> in the infected 9804-rxo <dig> plants, which are known to be regulated by typical cc-nbs-lrr type of r genes in the interaction between plant and pathogen  <cit> . although rxo <dig> belongs to the group of nbs-lrr  <cit> , how its product recognizes effector  of xoc and triggers signal transduction cascade leading to hr remains a mystery.

third, a large set of genes encoding ppr and rrm proteins were uniquely up-regulated in 9804-rxo <dig> by xoc, but not in  <dig>  suggesting that the post-transcriptional modification might be an important feature in the rxo <dig> mediated hr in the heterologous rice plants. ppr and rrm proteins are reportedly involved in a wide range of different post-transcriptional processes in plant organelles  <cit>  and may also affect nuclear gene expression by plastid to nucleus signaling pathway  <cit> . the presence of a common g-box, aactgg, within the cis-element in the promoter regions of these ppr genes strongly suggests these ppr genes may have been involved in the ja mediated disease responses  <cit> . it is generally accepted that sa plays a major role in activating defenses against biotrophic pathogens, whereas ja and et are usually associated with defenses against necrotrophic pathogen attacks  <cit> . thus, the cross-talk between these two defense signaling pathways is important in plant defenses system to specific pathogens  <cit> . in this respect, our results suggested that rxo <dig> could activate the gene networks of some basal defense signaling pathways in rice, including both et and ja-dependent signaling pathways, even though how rxo <dig> mediated the complex signaling pathways leading to hr of rice to xoc remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
the molecular mechanisms underlying hr of rice to its bacterial pathogen, xoc mediated by a non-host maize r gene, rxo <dig> were investigated using a microarray experiment and a pair of transgenic and non-transgenic rice lines. our results indicated that rxo <dig> appeared to function in the very early step of the interaction between rice and xoc, and could specifically activate large numbers of genes involved in signaling pathways leading to hr and some basal defensive pathways such as sa and et pathways. in the former case, rxo <dig> appeared to differ from the typical host r genes in that it could lead to hr without activating ndr <dig>  in the latter cases, rxo <dig> was able to induce a unique group of set of wrky tf genes and a large set of genes encoding ppr proteins that share the same g-box in their promoter regions with possible functions in post-transcriptional regulation. some key genes that function in the downstream of rxo <dig> were identified, including osnpr <dig> and ospr <dig>  thus, our results elucidated some interesting aspects on the molecular mechanism of the non-host resistance of rice mediated by rxo <dig> and provided useful information to understand on the evolution of plant resistance genes.
