BACKGROUND
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  are a group of organic compounds composed of two or more fused aromatic rings in linear, angular, or cluster arrangements  <cit> . pahs are of particular concern because of their hydrophobic, recalcitrant, persistent, potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic properties, and their ubiquitous occurrence in the environment.

over 90% of pahs in the environment reside in surface soil  <cit> . furthermore, plants grown in pah-contaminated soils can become contaminated with pahs due to their absorption  <cit> . therefore, they may pose human and animal health hazards. previous studies have shown that dietary intake of pahs can be a significant route of exposure to the general population where vegetables and grains are a major source of dietary pahs  <cit> . it is thus important to understand exactly how pahs are transported into the plant root system and into the human food chain, since it is helpful to produce pah-free crop products by means of genetic engineering, to remove pahs from pah-polluted soils or water through phytoremediation, and to model potential uptake for risk assessment.

over the last three decades, organic compounds uptake by roots, particularly pesticides/herbicides, has been widely studied  <cit> . plant roots can take up organic contaminants via passive diffusive partitioning  and/or active  process, depending on the properties of the organic contaminant and the plant species. passive transport proceeds in the direction of decreasing chemical potential; nevertheless, active transport is against the chemical potential gradient, requiring expenditure of energy  <cit> . the absorption of non-ionized organic compounds by roots of higher plants is generally thought to be a passive, diffusive, partitioning and nonmetabolic process  <cit> . uptake of non-ionized organic compounds is influenced by the properties of the contaminant  <cit> . briggs et al.  <cit>  established a linear relationship between the octanol/water partition coefficient  of non-ionized chemicals and the observed root concentration factor  from their experiments involving in the uptake of omethylcarbamoyloximes and substituted phenylureas into barley plants. with consideration of the passive transport of non-ionic organic pollutants into plants , a partition-limited model has been proposed to estimate the concentration of a contaminant in plants  <cit> . however, during further test of the partition-limited model through uptake of pahs by plant roots, some researchers observed that predicted and measured values of pah content in plant roots fitted well at low pah concentrations in soils or hydroponic solution, whereas the prediction error was considerably large, with a maximum of more than 81%, at high pah concentration in soils or hydroponic solution  <cit> . collins et al.  <cit>  pointed out that looking at root uptake of non-ionic organic chemicals purely as a partitioning process may be incorrect as this assumes it is independent of concentration, which it is not when the roots become saturated. wild et al.  <cit>  visualized the occurrence of anthracene and phenanthrene within the root cell vacuole using two-photon excitation microscopy. all of the above-mentioned seem to indicate that the passive uptake cannot satisfactorily account for the transport process of pahs into plant roots.

despite much work regarding uptake and accumulation of non-ionized organic compounds like pahs in plants conducted previously, mechanisms for pahs uptake by plant roots and translocation in plants still remain unclear, in particular, whether active transport is involved in root uptake of pahs and what the proportion of active transport to the total uptake of pahs by roots is.

in this paper, it is hypothesized that there are two general mechanisms for pahs uptake and transport, i.e. a passive and an active component coexisting in higher plants with their relative contribution being dependent much upon the plant species and pah levels. the objectives of this study are i) to confirm whether active transport is involved in the uptake of pahs by plant roots and ii) to evaluate the relative contribution of active and passive components with respect to pahs uptake and transport processes in higher plants. to our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that an active component is involved in pahs uptake.

RESULTS
absorption of pahs as a function of time
to investigate uptake of phe, wheat roots were exposed to  <dig>  μm phe for differing lengths of time and the amount of phe that passed into the root was determined. figure  <dig> shows the time-dependent phe accumulation in roots of intact wheat seedlings. phe uptake by wheat roots was nonlinear over  <dig> h. wheat roots continued to accumulate phe through  <dig> h. a characteristic immediate, rapid rate of uptake was followed by continued uptake but at a decreasing rate. phe uptake rates between  <dig>  and  <dig> h, and  <dig> and  <dig> h were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol g- <dig> fr wt h- <dig>  respectively. phe uptake rate in the first period  was almost  <dig> times higher than that in the period of  <dig> to  <dig> h.

effect of temperature
concentration-dependent uptake of phe by wheat roots has features of saturating kinetics within the range of  <dig>  μmol l- <dig>  phe water solubility . the curve can be described with michaelis-menten equation:   

where vmax  is the maximal transport rate when all available carrier sites are loaded, c  is the external concentration of phenanthrene, km  is the michaelis constant, equal to the substrate concentration giving half the maximal transport rate. generally, the lower the km value, the stronger the affinity between carrier and substrate carried  <cit> . the apparent km value  for the saturable curve was  <dig>  μm, significantly higher than the phe solubility in water . the vmax value was  <dig> nmol g- <dig> fresh weight h- <dig> 

the uptake of phe was significantly temperature-dependent . absorptions of phe at 25°c were markedly higher than at 4°c , suggesting that low temperature  inhibited the uptake of phe by wheat roots compared with phe uptake at 25°c. the inhibition by low temperature became stronger with an increase in phe concentration in hydroponic solution. the inhibition effect of the low temperature was slight for the treatment with phe concentrations of 0- <dig>  μm, whereas the inhibition effect was strengthened for the treatment with phe concentrations of  <dig> - <dig>  μm. the inhibition rate, i.e.,  × 100/uptake of phe at 25°c, ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

effect of  <dig> -dinitrophenol
in general, dinitrophenol  is considered primarily as an uncoupler of oxidative  phosphorylation, and of proton-coupled fluxes at the plasma membrane and endomembranes via the dissipation of transmembrane electrochemical gradients of protons. the effect of  <dig> -dnp, a common metabolic inhibitor, upon the uptake of phe was investigated in this study. uptake of phe was strongly depressed by  <dig> mm  <dig> -dnp but was not completely inhibited . the decreased phe uptake induced by  <dig> -dnp was statistically pronounced with paired t-test, at 95% confidence level. similar to the inhibition effect of low temperature on uptake of phe, the depression effect of  <dig> -dnp also exhibited a dependence on phe concentration. at phe concentrations of 0- <dig>  μm, the inhibition effect of  <dig> -dnp was lighter. but the inhibition effect of  <dig> -dnp was much stronger at phe concentrations of  <dig> - <dig>  μm with rates between  <dig> % and  <dig> % .

effect of naphthalene
most of the studies regarding pah uptake by plant roots have hitherto focused on an individual pah  <cit> . however, pah uptake by plant roots with the presence of two or more types of pahs is less addressed. phe uptakes by wheat roots with the absence and presence of naphthalene  are presented in figure  <dig>  although the water solubility of nap  is much higher than that of phe   <cit> , wheat roots took up more phe than nap  with phe uptake  <dig>  times more than that of nap. the presence of nap inhibited phe uptake, in turn, phe also inhibited nap uptake. uptake of phe decreased by as much as  <dig> % with the presence of nap, whereas nap uptake decreased by  <dig> % in the presence of phe. the inhibition rate exhibited a similar trend. the inhibition rate of phe uptake by nap, i.e.,  × 100/uptake of phe by wheat roots treated with phe, was  <dig> %, and that of nap uptake by phe, i.e.,  × 100/uptake of nap by wheat roots treated with nap, was  <dig> %. both decrease in uptake and the inhibition rate revealed that the inhibition of nap uptake by phe was stronger than that of phe uptake by nap. therefore, competitive inhibition occurs when  <dig> or more types of pah are present in culture solution.

effect of ph
the interaction between protons  and other cations or anions is of general importance for plant mineral nutrition. thus, external solution ph has received much attention during absorption of compounds by plant roots  <cit> . in the present work, phe uptake by wheat roots caused significant increase in external nutrient solution ph . moreover, Δph  increased with the increase of phe uptake by wheat roots. for example, Δph is  <dig>  in the control, about a 2-fold increase in the treatment with  <dig>  μm phe, and an increase factor of  <dig> in the treatment with  <dig>  μm phe. in the control, the increase in nutrient solution ph resulted from a no3-/h+ symport  <cit> . obviously, nutrient solution ph increase in the other two treatments was caused by phe uptake when compared with the control. the change in ph during uptake of phenanthrene by wheat roots in millipore water further confirmed this phenomenon .

hoagland nutrient solution  and millipore water  were employed for hydroponic solution. a, b, c, p <  <dig> . phe, phenanthrene. ph <dig>  phinitial. ph <dig>  phafter  <dig> h. Δph = phafter  <dig> h - phinitial.

discussion
in contrast to uptake of ions by plant roots, mechanisms for uptake of non-ionic organic chemicals like pahs still remain poorly understood. chemicals may enter plant roots through passive and/or active process and this process is much dependent on the types of plant and chemical, and chemical level in solution. passive uptake is a nonmetabolic, 'downhill' process, driven by diffusion or mass flow. however, active uptake is an 'uphill', energy-consuming process against the gradient of potential energy. it is generally accepted that the uptake of anthropogenic organic chemicals by plant roots is a passive, diffusive process  <cit> . thus, the uptake of pahs by plant roots is assumed to be a passive, partitioning process  <cit> . actually, the process of pahs absorption by plant roots is considerably complex and little information about mechanisms for pahs uptake by the plant roots addressed is available.

kvesitadze et al.  <cit>  have reported that roots absorb environmental contaminants in two phases: in the first fast phase, substances diffuse from the surrounding medium into the root; in the second they gradually distribute and accumulate in the tissues. in this study, the time course of phe uptake within  <dig> h can be divided into two parts : a fast influx period  and a slow influx period . during the fast period, sorption by root cell wall, diffusion and transpiration flow cause a high rate of phe uptake. gao et al.  <cit>  have also found an initial rapid uptake phase of phe by ryegrass. nevertheless, the low rate of phe uptake after the initial rapid uptake phase is mainly attributable to passage into root cytoplasm and vacuole. the time course of phe uptake by wheat roots is consistent with that of glyphosate uptake by suspension-cultured potato  <cit> . denis and delrot  <cit> , and tilquin et al.  <cit>  have observed that glyphosate uptake by broad bean and catharanthus roseus cells is an active process. this seems to imply that the active process is involved in phe uptake by wheat roots.

to further understand the uptake process for phe in wheat roots, the investigations with respect to the effects of temperature and inhibitor were conducted. phe uptake by plant roots is related to its concentration  <cit> . in the concentration range of phe studied, phe uptake is best explained by a single saturable system with a km of  <dig>  μm and a vmax of  <dig> nmol g- <dig> fresh weight h- <dig>  denis and delrot  <cit>  have found that phosphate uptake by broad bean is characterized by a saturating nature. hart et al.  <cit>  have also observed the similar characteristic in paraquat uptake by roots of intact maize seedlings. they attributed the saturable kinetics to uptake via a carrier-mediated process due to the kinetics of ion or molecule transport through membranes of plant cells like the relationship between an enzyme and its substrate, using terms of enzymology. our result is in agreement with those reported by denis and delrot  <cit> , and hart et al.  <cit> , which indicates that the carrier-mediated process exists during phe uptake by wheat roots. naphthalene is a pah with two benzene rings, and phenanthrene consists of three condensed benzene rings. the competitive effect of phe and nap upon root uptake may appear on account of their similar physico-chemical properties . reciprocal inhibition in root uptake between phe and nap further suggests that pah uptake by wheat roots proceeds with a carrier-mediated system, and nap and phe share a common transport mechanism.

the fact that uptake is not affected by temperature is an indicator that the compounds are retained by physical sorption rather than biochemically  <cit>  and metabolically coupled membrane transport processes may be inhibited by low temperature  <cit> , whereas physical processes such as adsorption and diffusion are only slightly affected by temperature  <cit> . moreover, hart et al.  <cit>  have pointed out that the difference in ion levels measured in intact roots at 23°c and in intact roots incubated at low temperature  can represent ion taken up across the root plasma membrane. the results presented in figure  <dig> display that the rate of phe absorption at 4°c was a part of the rate at 25°c. the reduction in absorption of phe by low temperature increased with increasing external phe concentration in hydroponic solution. a similar effect of low temperature upon zn2+ uptake was found previously for sugarcane leaves  <cit> , barley roots  <cit>  and wheat roots  <cit> . in addition, liang et al.  <cit>  also found si uptake by cucumber roots was inhibited by low temperature. the above authors interpreted these findings as evidence of the metabolic control of absorption. in the present study, we found that lower temperature of 4°c didn't result in a distinct decrease of phe apparent solubility in hoagland nutrient solution containing  <dig> % methanol as compared to the temperature at 25°c. therefore, the reduction in phenanthrene uptake by wheat root at low temperature is not due to the decrease in phenanthrene apparent solubility caused by low temperature. figure  <dig> shows that  <dig> -dnp may inhibit phe uptake by wheat roots and the inhibition effect of  <dig> -dnp on phe uptake is gradually strengthened with increasing external phe concentration in the culture solution. the inhibitions by  <dig> -dnp and by low temperature are approximately even, with inhibition rate up to almost 40%. the data from figure  <dig> and  <dig> suggest the existence of metabolic mediation in the phe absorption process.

phe uptake by wheat roots results in an increase in external solution ph . furthermore, the larger the amount of phe taken up by wheat roots, the higher external solution ph. however, the passive absorption process cannot satisfactorily explain the phenomenon that occurs during the absorption of phe . it is well known that the no3-/h+ symport can cause an increase in external solution ph  <cit> . williams et al.  <cit>  and noiraud et al.  <cit>  have reported that sucrose transport across the plasma membrane is a sucrose-h+ symport process. similar to sucrose, phe is present in solution as a form of molecule. we presume that phe influx may be coupled with h+ influx and that phe transport across the plasma membrane proceeds via a phe/nh+ symport mechanism. although the hypothesis of phe/nh+ symport remains to be further tested, the change in external solution ph during root uptake of phe indicates that active absorption is involved in phe influx into wheat roots.

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained in this study show that two biochemical mechanisms interplay in the root uptake of phe:  a fast partitioning, nonmetabolic, and 'downhill' process driven by sorption, diffusion or mass flow, which takes place immediately after the transfer of wheat roots into culture solution, and  a later, slow component, which is mediated by an transporter and metabolism. in the slow process, the competition between phe and nap during uptake exists. this study demonstrates that a carrier-mediated, energy-consuming process is involved in phe uptake by roots of intact wheat seedlings. this information may be beneficial to govern crop contamination by pahs, and to yield safe produce. it is also useful in remedying soils or waters polluted by pahs with plants.
