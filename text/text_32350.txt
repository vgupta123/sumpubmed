BACKGROUND
crop plants take up sulphur  mainly in the form of sulphate and assimilate it into many compounds such as cysteine, methionine, glutathione , co–enzymes and vitamins. in addition, s is present within many plant secondary metabolites possessing various functions in plant metabolism  <cit> . compared with other crops such as cereals or legumes, oilseed rape  is particularly sensitive to s limitation because it has a high demand for s  <cit> . the decline in industrial emissions of so <dig> leads to a depletion of sulphate  in soil, which impacts on oilseed rape growth and on both grain yield and oil quality  <cit> . recent transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches have shown that alterations in the expression levels of numerous genes associated with metabolic and physiological changes allow arabidopsis thaliana to respond to s limitation or restriction  <cit> . first, the limitation of s supply provokes a decrease in cysteine and an increase in o–acetylserine , its precursor. the accumulation of oas and the decrease in gsh are then presumed to regulate the expression of numerous genes, such as the induction of genes implicated in s uptake, assimilation and redistribution, improving the acquisition and the utilisation of s for plant growth  <cit> . nevertheless, as reported by rouached et al. <cit> , these regulatory roles are questioned in the light of a number of experimental outcomes. oilseed rape is also able to enhance its s remobilisation efficiency to sustain the s demand for growth under s restriction  <cit> . this is highly related to  the level of the so42– pool previously stored in source leaves and  the up–regulation of bnsultr4; <dig> and bnsultr4; <dig> expression  <cit> , which are two genes encoding transporters that have been implicated in vacuolar efflux of so42– <cit> . other sulphate transporter genes in oilseed rape leaves and roots also respond positively to s limitation, leading to an increase in sulphate absorption and transport capacities at the whole plant level  <cit> . in spite of these processes, a lasting s limitation leads to an accumulation of amino acids, which is assumed to down–regulate nitrogen uptake and assimilation, while processes that increase the turnover of organic s compounds and stress defence responses are induced. severe s limitation can ultimately result in a reduced growth, which is particularly associated with a reduced shoot:root ratio .

compared to the numerous results obtained through metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches, studies of proteomic modifications occurring in response to s restriction remain scarce in the brassicacea family. however, this kind of approach has the advantage of integrating the regulation of gene expression, taking into account any post–transcriptional control. indeed, transcriptome analysis is not sufficient for observing such regulation and does not completely predict the corresponding proteomic profile, especially in allopolyploid species such as oilseed rape. as recently reported by marmagne et al. <cit>  in different neo synthesised oilseed rape lines, the majority of genes encoding proteins that exhibit additive gene expression are not expressed additively at the protein level. such differences between transcription and protein expression could also occur in the case of s limitation, which could partially explain the observed temporal differences between metabolomic and transcriptomic responses  <cit> . additionally, the decrease in cysteine and methionine contents from restriction of s could have an impact on the expression of essential proteins. the effect of s limitation on the proteome was mentioned in regard to arabidopsis by higashi et al. <cit> . these authors have reported a significant disruption in the seed proteome in response to a s restriction, such as a reduction in the expression of proteins rich in s–amino acids  that was not related to the accumulation of corresponding mrnas. therefore, a proteomic approach is particularly relevant in oilseed rape for the study of s limitation impacts on metabolic pathways. in order to address this question on a major oleaginous crop such as oilseed rape, our study aims to determine the leaf proteome modifications caused by a long–term s depletion occurring at the rosette stage . this proteomic approach was combined with a physiological study to provide new insights about the plant response to s restriction.

RESULTS
impact of s limitation on physiological parameters
at the rosette stage, the low s treatment did not affect shoot and root growth significantly, compared to the control . however, a slight increase in the shoot:root ratio appeared after  <dig> d of s restriction  compared to control plants. the growth of leaf # <dig>  identified as a young leaf at the beginning of s treatment, and leaf # <dig>  which appeared between  <dig> and  <dig> d after initiation of treatment, did not differ depending on the level of s supply . despite such lack of difference in growth, the length of petioles  as well as the biomass of petioles of younger leaves  were significantly reduced by  <dig> d of low s treatment  compared to the control .

data are means ± standard error . none significant difference from the control was observed.

there were no significant differences in the chlorophyll and flavonol contents in leaves # <dig>  and # <dig> . however, after  <dig> d of s restriction, a significant increase in the relative anthocyanin content was observed in leaf # <dig> compared with control . in particular, this increase was also visible on the abaxial face of leaf # <dig> of low s plants, which showed a violet colour that is indicative of anthocyanins at  <dig> d of s restriction .

a significantly lower photosynthetic activity  and a higher intercellular co <dig> concentration  were also observed in leaf # <dig> of s restricted plants  compared to control after  <dig> d. the s amounts of leaf # <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> d of treatment were significantly lower in low s plants , while the 34s quantities did not differ in this leaf between the two considered treatments .

in order to evaluate the impact of s restriction on the occurrence of oxidative stress, the h2o <dig> content was determined in young leaf . while the h2o <dig> content of young leaf at position # <dig> remained unchanged after  <dig> d, it was significantly higher after  <dig> d of s limitation compared to control conditions. after  <dig> d of s treatment, h2o <dig> content in the young leaf of s-limited plants was  <dig> -fold higher than in the young leaf of control plants .

s restriction affects the young leaf proteome
the proteomic profiles of leaf # <dig> were compared after  <dig> d of treatment between control and low s plants. the total protein extracts showed no significant difference in protein content between these two treatments . analysis of gels obtained after two–dimensional electrophoresis revealed that  <dig> protein spots were modulated in this leaf in response to s limitation compared to the control . beyond those spots,  <dig> and  <dig> spots were respectively induced and repressed by low s treatment. lc–ms/ms enabled the identification of  <dig> spots, as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

significant anova was followed by a mann–whitney test  carried out on the leaf–normalised spot volumes . experimental and theoretical pi / mr, the number of lc–ms/ms matched peptides , the score and the percentage of sequence coverage  obtained are also indicated. the assigned best–matched protein is listed with the organism in which it was identified and its genbank protein accession number.

among the  <dig> proteins that were repressed in low s conditions , several chloroplastic proteins were characterized: a photosystem i chlorophyll a/b binding protein ; a protein showing similarity with ferredoxin–nadp reductase ; and a chloroplastic malate dehydrogenase  that could be involved in the “malate valve”. the “malate valve” catalyses the export of malate from the chloroplast when the nadph to nadp+ ratio is high  <cit> . thi <dig> , a protein located in the chloroplast and mitochondrion that is involved in thiamine synthesis, was also repressed. a mitochondrial chaperonin, heat shock protein , and a glutathione s–transferase , an enzyme especially involved in detoxification of xenobiotics, were also negatively affected. spots  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  similarly repressed by the s restriction treatment, were identified as germin–like proteins, which may present an oxalate oxidase activity  <cit> .

spots  <dig> and  <dig>  strongly induced in our study  correspond to chloroplastic water soluble chlorophyll binding proteins  in brassica oleracea, which present a dual function of protection of chlorophyll against reactive oxygen species  and protease inhibitor activity  <cit> . a trypsin inhibitor propeptide , was also significantly induced in leaf # <dig> after  <dig> d of s restriction , compared to control. the atp synthase f1–subunit , responsible for the atp synthesis that occurs during the light phase of photosynthesis, was also induced. a strong accumulation of a β–carbonic anhydrase was also observed . this enzyme, that reversibly catalyses co <dig> hydration into carbonate , is involved in various metabolic processes  <cit> . similarly, a protein associated with the chloroplastic cu-zn superoxide dismutase  encoded by the csd <dig> gene in a. thaliana <cit>  was induced in leaf # <dig> after  <dig> d of s restriction. this protein is well known to be involved in defence against oxidative stress. a spot identified as a putative myrosinase–binding protein from brassica rapa  was also induced under s restriction. the enzymes 12–oxophitodienoate reductase  and 1–aminocyclopropane–1–carboxylate synthase , which catalyse jasmonate and ethylene synthesis respectively  <cit>  were similarly induced in leaf # <dig> after  <dig> d of s restriction. finally, a slight induction was observed for a vacuolar atpase subunit , a tonoplastic protein involved in active transport in vacuoles  <cit> .

discussion
s limitation at the rosette stage does not change the total shoot biomass but inhibits growth and photosynthesis of young leaves
as previously described in brassica olearacea <cit>  and oilseed rape  <cit> , s restriction applied at the rosette stage over  <dig> d does not result in a significant inhibition of the total shoot growth . however, these results contrast with two studies showing a growth reduction after a shorter period of s depletion in oilseed rape  <cit> . in these cases, the chlorophyll content of young leaves was also affected by the s restriction, a symptom that was not found in our study. our finding suggests that during the  <dig> d preceding the sulphate limitation, plants have sufficiently absorbed and stored s for sustainable growth and maintenance of the various physiological processes measured during the following  <dig> d of treatment. it thus appears that at the rosette stage, s limitation has varying effects on oilseed rape, depending on the initial level of s storage.

nevertheless, in our experiment, a significant reduction in biomass and length of petioles in the younger leaves  was observed after  <dig> d of low s treatment compared to the control. if this reduction in petiole length is confirmed in further experiments, it could be possible to use this morphological trait as an indicator of s deficiency during the early vegetative stage of oilseed rape development. the total s amount in young leaf # <dig> of low s plants was significantly lower than control . this indicates that s limitation has a negative impact on young leaf metabolism. indeed, this is highlighted by a significant increase in anthocyanin content , a decrease in photosynthetic activity , and is associated with a higher intercellular co <dig> concentration . proteome analysis performed on the young leaf # <dig> provides evidence that these physiological alterations were related to modulations of protein expression leading to metabolic changes that occurred in response to  <dig> d of s restriction.

proteins associated with s metabolism and remobilisation of s compounds are specifically modulated by s restriction
among the physiological responses that may contribute to compensating for low s nutrition, the remobilisation of s reserves is a major process. using 34s labelling, it appeared that low s plants are able to maintain the amount of 34s in young leaves at a relatively stable level compared to the control . in contrast, leaf # <dig> of control plants undergoes 34s isotope dilution associated with the chase–period , attesting that unlabelled s is absorbed and transported to this young leaf. as previously reported  <cit> , the redistribution of s in response to s limitation can be achieved by a strong remobilisation of previously stored sulphate, through a tissue–specific induction of genes encoding the sulphate transporters, sultr4; <dig> and 4; <dig>  which are involved in the efflux of sulphate accumulated in the vacuolar compartment. the proteomics approaches  revealed the induction of a vacuolar atpase subunit, which could be implicated in s remobilisation processes through the maintenance of an efficient sulphate efflux from the vacuole, so as to sustain growth  <cit> .

our proteomic analysis does not reveal modulation of proteins associated with primary s metabolism, probably due to the fact that the proteomic study was performed after  <dig> d of s limitation. however, some proteins implied in secondary s metabolism are affected by s limitation. the putative myrosinase–binding protein is induced by s restriction. because of its potential involvement in the regulation of myrosinase activity, this result suggests that glucosinolates can be used as a sulphate source in cases of severe s limitation. this finding is consistent with transcriptomic data and metabolome analysis in arabidopsis thaliana that reveal an induction of myrosinase binding protein gene induction  <cit>  and showed a decrease in the accumulation of glucosinolates in s restricted plants  <cit> . also, the repression of thi <dig>  involved in thiamine biosynthesis, may lead to a preferential allocation of cysteine for gsh and protein synthesis, since thiamine is produced from glyceraldehyde–3–phosphate and cysteine, two molecules whose levels are affected by the s limitation  <cit> . similarly, after  <dig> d of s restriction, the repression of glutathione s–transferase , also shown at the transcriptomic level in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , could reduce the xenobiotic detoxification capacity in the young leaf, may allow regulation of gsh utilisation for other purposes. these proteomic changes associated with the lower s content of leaf # <dig> observed in cases of s restriction clearly indicate a lack of s for the proper metabolism of this leaf.

proteins involved in c metabolism and processes related to energy production are impacted by s restriction
in young leaves, c metabolism appears to be affected by  <dig> d of s limitation, and particularly photosynthetic metabolism , which leads to a c fixation decline and a higher intercellular co <dig> concentration . the proteomics approaches performed in the present study  helped to understand how the s restriction interacts with c metabolism by determining the impact of s limitation on the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis.

the reduction of a putative chla/b binding protein could cause an inhibition of photosynthetic activity in young leaves, since this protein belongs to the photosystem i light harvesting complex  and is involved in chlorophyll protection against degradation. in arabidopsis thaliana, numerous genes encoding for this protein were also repressed in response to s depletion  <cit> . however, the impact of a lower accumulation of this chla/b binding protein would be minimal since the s restriction applied in our experiment did not result in altering the chlorophyll level of the young leaves studied. spots no.  <dig> and  <dig> , identified as water soluble chlorophyll binding protein , correspond to serine protease inhibitor that can bind to chlorophyll. the accumulation of wscps such as wscp <dig>  wscp <dig> and bnd <dig> is also observed in young leaves of oilseed rape subjected to a nitrogen starvation , in comparison with well–fed oilseed rape   <cit> . wscps, that are specific of brassicacea, may also be involved in chlorophyll protection against ros and in the maintenance of protein content  <cit> . interestingly, proteomics approaches revealed the induction of trypsin inhibitor propeptide , which is able to inhibit proteases, binding with them in their active site. therefore, the strong accumulation of wscps and trypsin inhibitor propeptide could be involved in maintaining the protein content and chlorophyll level observed in leaf # <dig> under low s nutrition.

in contrast, two proteins that belong to the electron transfer chain in the thylakoidal membrane were repressed: plastocyanin  and ferredoxin-nadp reductase . because these two proteins act in the final stages of electron transfer during the light phase of photosynthesis and fnr catalyses the production of nadph+h+ required for co <dig> assimilation, it could be hypothesized that the first physiological symptoms of s limitation result in an alteration of the coupling between the light and dark phases of photosynthesis leading to a depletion of c assimilation by the limitation of nadph+h+ availability. indeed, sulphate restriction is known to affect c assimilation leading to a reduction in photosynthetic activity and a distortion of glycolytic flux, which can be assumed as a repercussion of amino acid accumulation, itself resulting from a reduction of s assimilation into cysteine  <cit> . these changes to proteins associated with c metabolism observed in our study may lead to the accumulation of intercellular co <dig> , which may finally result in the inhibition of growth in young leaves.

the strong accumulation of a β–carbonic anhydrase is also indicative of a c metabolism disruption in this leaf in response to  <dig> d of s restriction. this enzyme, which catalyses the reversible hydration of co <dig> to form hco3– and h+, is directly involved in the co <dig> metabolism associated with the calvin cycle  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, s limitation also results in the induction of the gene encoding this protein in leaves  <cit> . the accumulation of this protein would allow a better solubilisation of co <dig> at the cellular level and could therefore promote photosynthetic processes at the leaf level. it may also modify the ph of the intracellular medium, which could impact on numerous protein activities. therefore, it can be assumed that the reduction in photosynthetic activity and the accumulation of co <dig> at the intercellular level are not directly caused by the reduction in the cysteine content or oas accumulation, but could be related closely to c metabolism disturbances.

proteomic analysis also shows an induction of proteins implicated in the maintenance of energy production in young leaves subjected to low s treatment such as the catalytic α–subunit of chloroplastic atp synthase. the induction of this enzyme, involved in atp synthesis at the end of the electron transport chain in the thylakoidal membrane, suggests that the production of atp in chloroplasts is favoured in the case of s limitation. this hypothesis is supported by the induction of proteins  involved in the maintenance of reactions of the light phase of photosynthesis, providing the proton gradient required for atp synthesis.

although the repression of the thiazole biosynthetic enzyme  may lead to a preferential allocation of cysteine, it could have a negative impact on carbohydrate metabolism, whether on glycolysis/neoglucogenesis or on chlorophyll synthesis. thiamine, an s containing molecule, is the precursor of thiamine pyrophosphate, an essential co–enzyme for the activity of key enzymes involved in c metabolism such as pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate oxidase or transketolase  <cit> . the repression of this enzyme could also cause chlorosis if s restriction is extended beyond  <dig> d. indeed, in arabidopsis thaliana, atthi <dig> mutants result in a significant decrease in the chlorophyll level leading to photobleaching  <cit> . thi <dig> repression, similar to hsp <dig>  is also a sign of mitochondrial stress caused by s limitation since this protein is also involved in mitochondrial dna damage tolerance  <cit> .

proteomic analysis has also revealed the repression of a chloroplast malate dehydrogenase  suggesting a relative reduction in malate export  <cit> . additionally, the repression of a mitochondrial mdh that uses nadh to reduce oxaloacetate to malate, which is then exported to the cytosol, also suggests an alteration of energy production through the krebs cycle. this protein, highly regulated in a post–translational manner, is involved in the partitioning of c and energy, and here could be partly responsible for the reduction in net co <dig> consumption, as suggested by tomaz et al. <cit> . these chloroplastic and mitochondrial mdh repressions could also be implied in the malate accumulation observed in oilseed rape in the case of s deficiency  <cit> . indeed, with respect to sulphate decreases, malate may be transported into the vacuole where it could act as a counter ion for cations as assumed by blake–kalff et al. <cit> .

s restriction provokes physiological and proteomic changes related to oxidative stress in young leaves
in accordance with the arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome responses to s restriction  <cit> , our proteomic study showed an accumulation of 12–oxophytodienoate reductase, which catalyses the last step of jasmonic acid biosynthesis. jasmonic acid could have a positive effect on s metabolism in cases of s limitation through the induction of many genes such as aps <dig> and aps <dig> coding for atp sulfurylase, sat <dig> coding for serine acetyltransferase  <cit> . interestingly, among the genes induced by jasmonic acid, there is the myrosinase binding-protein  <cit> . then, it could be postulated that the induction of this protein observed in our study is related to jasmonic acid accumulation in case of s limitation. indeed, several s compounds play a role in plant stress tolerance  <cit> , and jasmonic acid is known to participate in the transduction of stress responses  <cit> . this phytohormone could result ultimately in cell death, particularly via the induction of an oxidative stress. in response to s restriction, analysis of the leaf proteome also reveals the induction of acc synthase, an enzyme implicated in the biosynthesis pathway of ethylene. like jasmonic acid, ethylene plays a potential role in the stimulation of ros accumulation, which acts as a signalling molecule for inducing plant responses against biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> .

the accumulation of the chloroplastic cu–zn sod, associated with o <dig> - detoxification, also indicates that s limitation causes an oxidative stress in young leaves, as previously observed under s deficiency in mulberry plants  <cit> . the repression of protein spots showing similarity to germin–like proteins, which could have an oxalate oxidase activity that generates h2o <dig> and co <dig> <cit> , may thus be involved in reducing oxidative stress. furthermore, the strong accumulation of the β–carbonic anhydrase also suggests a possible antioxidant function of this enzyme as mentioned by slaymaker et al. <cit> . all these results together reinforce the idea that s restriction leads to an oxidative stress that seems to be actively attenuated in young leaves by the modulation of various proteins involved in resistance to oxidative stress. however, our findings show an increase in h2o <dig> content after  <dig> and  <dig> d of s restriction, demonstrating that these defence mechanisms do not appear entirely effective.

CONCLUSIONS
a relatively long period  of s limitation affects c metabolism in the young leaves of oilseed rape, and in particular the photosynthetic activity through the repression of dark reactions, as evidenced by the reduction of co <dig> assimilation and the accumulation of intercellular co <dig>  a general scheme for summarizing the cascade of events that explain the impact of s limitation on photosynthesis was proposed in figure  <dig>  the reduction in co <dig> assimilation in young leaf is not due to a decrease in chlorophylls, which remains stable, but it is probably related to an alteration of the final stages of electron transfer and a limitation of nadph+h+ due to the repression of pc and fnr. the accumulation of h2o <dig> and anthocyanins indicated that s limitation also provokes an oxidative stress in young leaves. this could be explained by  the repression of fnr that might amplify the formation of ros by the mehler reaction, resulting in the transfer of electrons to o <dig> by ferredoxin, producing o <dig> -,  the higher abundance of cu-zn sod, which detoxifies o <dig> - into h2o <dig>  and  the up-regulation of enzymes involved in the synthesis of jasmonic acid  and ethylene , two phytohormones potentially involved in the induction of oxidative stress. simultaneously,  chlorophylls and protein contents remained stable,  wscps which are involved in the protection of chlorophyll against photooxidation, were induced, and  atp synthase f <dig> complex were accumulated. this suggests that, despite the occurrence of an oxidative stress, the capacity of leaves to absorb photosynthetic active radiations by the photosystems and atp production remain efficient for as long as possible. however, these protection mechanisms against ros damage via the regulation of ros production and detoxification are not fully effective to enable tolerance to a long period of s limitation.

our proteomic study does not reveal inductions of well known biomolecular markers of s deficiency that were identified in arabidopsis thaliana such as isoflavonoïde reductase, involved in anthocyanins synthesis, or primary s metabolism enzymes  <cit> . then, it could be interesting to perform a kinetic study of changes in leaf proteome to determine the first events associated with s limitation, and verify if these typical marker genes are also detectable using 2-de in brassica napus.
