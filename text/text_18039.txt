BACKGROUND
in northwest of china, mini chinese cabbage  is highly valued by consumers, and is widely cultivated during winter in solar-greenhouses where low light  fluence  is a major abiotic stress factor limiting plant growth and crop productivity. the exposure of most plants to ll condition affects metabolism in various ways including the alteration of enzyme activity  and disruption of transcription  <cit> . low light fluence also inhibited violaxanthin de-epoxidase, causing failure of the protective xanthophyll cycle  <cit> . the alleviation role of 5-aminolevulinic acid and calcium in cucumber under ll condition was reported  <cit> . therefore, understanding the genetic and biochemical processes that regulate ll tolerance is a vital area of research in plant biology.

ammonium  and nitrate  improved plants tolerance to environmental stress, including low light stress  <cit> , drought  <cit> , salinity  <cit> , alkalinity  <cit> , disease  <cit> , heavy metal toxicity  <cit> , higher co <dig> concentration  <cit> , and ultraviolet radiation  <cit> . in addition, nh4
+ and no3
− have different effects on physiological and biochemical processes including photorespiration, photosynthesis, nutrient absorption and nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . cruz et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that increasing nh4
+ significantly increased photosynthetic acclimation to elevated co <dig> during the early growth stage of cassava. however, the negative effect of nh4
+ on photosynthesis was also observed at the later growth stages.

improving photosynthesis is vital to maintaining sufficient dry biomass accumulation, especially in plants subjected to ll condition. the total co <dig> assimilation rate is limited by light intensity, temperature, co <dig> diffusion , enzyme activity , substrate availability , and respiratory co <dig> release  <cit> . for increasing plant yield, identifying limiting points in photosynthetic process is the central issue. calvin cycle contains  <dig> different enzymes which catalyze  <dig> reactions in the three phases of carboxylation, reduction and regeneration. it is initiated by the enzyme ribulose- <dig>  5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase  which catalyses the carboxylation of the co <dig> acceptor molecule, ribulose- <dig>  5-bisphosphate . the 3-phosphoglycerate  formed in carboxylation stage is then used to form the 3-phosphate glyceraldehyde  and dihydroxyacetone phosphate , through two reactions that consume atp and nadph. the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  plays an important role in the second reaction. the regenerative phase of the cycle involves a series of reactions. these reactions convert gap and dhap into the co <dig> acceptor molecule, rubp. the fructose- <dig>  6-bisphosphatase , fructose- <dig>  6-bisphosphate aldolase  and transketolase  play the vital roles in these reactions. the gap produced in the calvin cycle mostly remains within the cycle to regenerate rubp, while only few exits from the cycle and are utilized to synthesis sucrose and starch  <cit> . the mechanism involved in photosynthesis with different nitrogen forms has been reviewed by guo et al.  <cit> , and includes changes in stomatal density and mesophyll conductance, alteration in photosynthetic enzyme activities, and changes in accumulation of photosynthetic outcome. as a consequence, photosynthesis is limited mainly by light intensity, light use efficiency and co <dig> assimilation capacity among other factors.

as demonstrated by lu et al.  <cit> , total replacement of no3
− by nh4
+ induced a reduction of stomatal conductance and a decreased dry weight. moreover, nitrogen in the form of no3
− alone or nh4no <dig> resulted in a greater dry weight gain in tobacco than when nh4
+ was applied alone. although there have been several studies on altered expression of genes coding for calvin cycle enzymes after exposure to exogenous substance or under environmental stress in cucumber  <cit> , the consequences for nh4
+- induced enhancement of photosynthesis under ll condition has not been extensively explored. however, the application of moderate nh4
+ was recently found to have enhanced the ll tolerance of mini chinese cabbage seedlings in an earlier experiment  <cit> . to understand the underlying mechanism of moderate nh4
+- induced promotion of net photosynthetic rate , investigations are needed to conclusively confirm that the presence of nh4
+ in the nutrient solution promotes photosynthesis. in this study, we reported the mechanisms with which moderate nh4
+: no3
− improved the tolerance of mini chinese cabbage seedlings to ll condition in the greenhouse.

gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters
the net photosynthetic rate , stomatal conductance  and intercellular co <dig> concentration  directly reflect plant photosynthetic capacity, and whether the limiting factor of photosynthesis is stomatal or not can be judged by these gas exchange parameters. the reduction of light fluence was the most determinant factor for all investigated parameters . as shown in fig.  <dig> c, in normal light fluence plants, the highest pn was observed in 15: <dig>  and the lowest in 0: <dig> . the plants supplied with nh4

discussion
photosynthesis is the main process by which plants produce and accumulate dry matter. the importance of water, light, nutrient and co <dig> in this process cannot be over emphasized. in the present study, we found that moderate nh4
+: no3
− application enhanced vegetative characteristics, while non-ammonium or higher ammonium application resulted in reduced growth under normal and low light conditions. this observation suggests that nh4
+ is actively involved in the promotion of plant growth. furthermore, in order to obtain the maximum biomass, less concentration of ammonium was needed in ll condition than in normal light condition. this was probably because low light reduced carbon metabolism of plants and less carbohydrate were accumulated in the tissues of the plants. thus, less photosynthate was transported from the shoot to the root in ll condition, and thus the energy used for ammonium assimilation in plant root was low. therefore, higher nh4
+ concentration in ll condition was not completely assimilated by plant root, and then accumulated in plant cells causing ammonium toxicity. sakakibara et al.  <cit>  reported that inorganic nitrogen  was a substrate for nitrogen assimilation and also functions as a signal triggering widespread changes in gene expression that modulate metabolism and development. they also demonstrated that a large research project that focused on nitrate action in gene expression of arabidopsis has provided the view of the extent of nitrate-dependent regulatory genes, including nitrogen metabolism, carbon metabolism and cytokinin responses. we also observed that nitrogen metabolism of plants decreased under ll condition, but the extent of the decrease of nitrogen metabolism was less than carbon metabolism, causing reduced c: n ratio. however, the application of 10% nh4
+ in solutions enhanced c: n ratio mainly by increasing the total carbohydrate contents. therefore, appropriate nh4
+ concentration in solution was beneficial for plants to maintain the balance of carbon and nitrogen metabolism. these results demonstrate that the level of nh4
+ is a rate-limiting factor for plant growth, and supplying appropriate nh4
+ levels for plants according to the light fluence is an effective way to promote plant growth and improve vegetable yield.

calvin cycle is the main rate-limiting factor of co <dig> assimilation
nitrogen can significantly affect the performance of the three main processes of photosynthesis: stomatal control of co <dig> supply, thylakoid electron transport , and calvin cycle   <cit> . our results indicate that the pn rate of nh4
+-treated plants was higher than those of sole no3
−-treated plants. low light fluence caused a decrease in pn per unit leaf area at 9 days after treatment under nh4
+:no3
−  application. however, the negative influence of ll was not observed in plants treated with nh4
+: no3
− . the addition of appropriate nh4
+ is beneficial for improved photosynthesis in ll condition. this finding was consistent with golvano et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated that nh4
+-fed plants had higher protein content and increased activity of photosynthetic enzymes compared with no3
−-fed plants. frantz et al.  <cit>  also reported that the inhibition of pn was caused by ammonium toxicity. claussen and lenz  <cit>  found that nh4
+ accumulation in leaves led to uncoupling of the electron transport form photophosphorylation in chloroplasts, which consequently led to decreased photosynthetic rate. in our study, we also observed that the reduction of photosynthesis in plants fertilized with sole no3
− was accompanied by decreased chlorophyll content, but this did not occur in plants treated with nh4
+: no3
− . this, therefore, suggests that the reduced photosynthesis is not the result of reduced light-harvesting capacity but possibly as a consequence of decreased gas conductance. it could also be due to the activities of calvin cycle enzymes or negative feedback regulation by accumulated carbon metabolites after sole no3
− treatment or higher nh4
+ concentration  treatment. we also observed that plants fed with only no3
− had significantly lower gs but higher ci, thus, reduced gas conductance as a major factor for reduced co <dig> assimilation was excluded. finally, the decreased pn in plants treated with only no3
− was consistent with reduced contents of glucose, fructose, sucrose and starch, making it unlikely that negative feedback regulation by accumulated carbon metabolites resulted in reduced photosynthetic rates. therefore, our results suggest that the net photosynthetic rate of plant treated by nh4
+: no3
− and light fluence was probably limited by the calvin cycle.

the chlorophyll fluorescence imaging is a helpful measurement to investigate several aspects of photosynthesis. this is because it reflects changes in thylakoid membrane organization and function and inhibition of photosynthesis and oxygen evolution through interactions with components of psii  <cit> . in the present study, the sole application of no3
− significantly reduced etr and fv/fm in normal light condition. low light fluence obviously reduced etr and fv/fm, while the addition of  <dig> and 15% nh4
+ inhibited the negative effect of ll on etr and fv/fm in different levels. as described by krause and weis  <cit> , damage to component of thylakoid membranes, especially those of psii, and inhibition of energy transfers from antenna molecules to reaction centers can result in lower fv/fm. in the chloroplast ultrastructure of mini chinese cabbage, the degree of granal stacking increased in nh4
+:no3
−  treated plants under ll condition  <cit> . similarly, bi et al.  <cit>  reported a decline in fv/fm, Φpsii after exposure to low temperature and low light intensity in transgenic cucumber plants. in our study, in normal light plants, the addition of nh4
+ increased Φpsii and qp, but the sole no3
− decreased the Φpsii and qp; while Φpsii in ll plants significantly decreased in higher nh4
+  treatment. higher ammonium concentration  applied to mini chinese cabbage seedlings under ll condition greatly degraded the grana lamella and decreased the light-captured area  <cit> . the significant decrease in Φpsii was mainly attributed to the decrease in degree of granal stacking, which is deemed as ‘down regulation’ of light energy absorbed area. in nh4
+:no3
−  treated plants under low light, the increase in qp was attributed to the increase in the consumption rate of reductants and atp generated from non-cyclic electron transport caused by enhanced carboxylation rate.

nh4+:no3− and light fluence regulate activities of several calvin cycle enzymes and expression of genes coding these enzymes
the photosynthesis rate is limited by the carboxylation reaction of rubisco and the capacity of rubp regeneration  <cit> . for instance, the capacity of rubp regeneration determines the photosynthetic rate under low irradiance or high co <dig> concentration. analysis of antisense plants with decreased activity of rubisco showed that the control coefficient on photosynthesis varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  depending on the experimental and growth conditions such as light intensity and co <dig> concentration  <cit> , suggesting that rubisco activity does not always dominate the photosynthesis rate and that other rate-limiting steps exist.

our results showed that nh4
+: no3
− and light fluence affected light capture system and the dark reaction - calvin cycle. moreover, calvin cycle is the main rate-limiting factor of co <dig> assimilation. nh4
+: no3
− regulates photosynthetic capacity, to a large extent, by affecting the capacity of rubisco carboxylation and rubp regeneration. the application of nh4
+: no3
−  to the plants under normal light significantly enhanced activities of rubisco, gapdh, fba, fbpase and tk, and the results was similar to the application of 10: <dig>  in ll plants. raab and terry  <cit>  demonstrated that the rubisco content of leaf in nh4
+ supplied sugar beet plants was significantly higher than those in no3
−supplied plants, and similar results were obtained by guo et al.  <cit>  when they conducted their experiment with rice plants. in the present study, the relative expressions of rbcs, rbcl, fba, fbpase and tk were up regulated in nh4
+-treated plants under normal light. low light fluence inhibited the expression of these genes in different levels, but rbcl, fba and fbpase were partially restored. the expression of rbcs and tk were above the control level in nh4
+: no3
−  treated plants. this result is similar to what was observed in rice leaves during ontogeny  <cit> . as described by wingler et al.  <cit> , low light intensity results in reduced expression of light-dependent genes and the disappearance of photosynthetic proteins. several studies have illustrated that up regulation of genes involved in calvin cycle leads to increased pn and enhanced vegetative growth, while reduced expression of these genes results in stunted plant growth  <cit> . we also observed that the relative expression of fba in plants under ll fed with nh4
+: no3
−  was higher than those fed with nh4
+: no3
− , whereas the enzyme activity of fba was reversed. changes in enzyme activity and gene expression under nh4
+: no3
− and light fluence conditions are not always positively correlated, suggesting the possibility of further regulatory mechanisms. the results were consistent with oelze et al.  <cit> , who reported that transcript abundance is poorly linked to de novo protein synthesis due to profound regulation at the level of translation. in general, effects of nh4
+: no3
− and light fluence on transcript levels and enzymes’ activities suggest that nh4
+: no3
− and light fluence play important role in the synthesis and activities of enzymes involved in calvin cycle.

rubp regeneration capacity depends on both photosynthetic electron transport chain and the enzymes downstream of rubisco in the calvin cycle  <cit> . in this study, we observed that while the addition of appropriate nh4
+ concentration promoted photosynthetic electron transport and expression of genes encoding the calvin cycle enzymes required for rubp regeneration, the application of sole no3
− inhibited these. among the examined enzymes involved in calvin cycle, rubisco is a vital enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of the co <dig> acceptor molecule, rubp, gapdh catalysed the conversion of  <dig>   <dig> - diphosphoglyceric acid into gap, while fbpase catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the calvin cycle and carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . the rubisco, gapdh and fbpase are activated by light fluence, usually in two ways: by changing the microenvironment and by producing effector. fba and tk are not controlled by iron - thioredoxin, but they are controlled by carbon fixation of photosynthesis to a greater extent  <cit> . for example, a decreased in fba level resulted in reduced rubp content, and then inhibited photosynthesis and growth of transgenic potato  <cit> . in a previous study, when tk activity decreased from  <dig> to 40%, it led to a significant reduction in rubp regeneration and significantly inhibited photosynthetic rate of plants  <cit> . in our current study, the activities of these enzymes in plants fed with only no3
− or higher nh4
+ decreased in 3 days after exposure to ll fluence and then gradually increased afterwards. nh4
+: no3
−  application alleviated the negative effect of ll on the activities of these calvin cycle enzymes. as demonstrated by rigano et al.  <cit> , ammonium assimilation required photosynthates imported through the phloem, causing a transitory decrease in the concentration of atp, along with noticeable variations in glucose- <dig> -pconcentration, a permanent decrease in free glucose concentration, an increase in respiratory oxygen consumption. the consumption of photosynthates drives the calvin cycling process. thus, the activities of calvin cycling enzymes were activated. rigano et al.  <cit>  also demonstrated that less ammonium was utilized in plants under dark condition than in illuminated plants. therefore, the addition of moderate nh4
+ in ll plants is beneficial for activating calvin cycling enzymes. the application of nh4
+: no3
−  enhanced activity of calvin cycle enzymes in ll fluence, and this was probably due to the fact that the absorbed nh4
+changed the microenvironment of chloroplast, or the nh4
+ assimilation activated the calvin cycle.

CONCLUSIONS
our results have shown that appropriate nh4
+ concentration in nutrient solution under ll condition significantly increased the fv/fm, the activities of calvin cycle enzymes, the relative expression of these genes, the levels of glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch, total carbohydrate and nitrogen, and c: n ratio in mini chinese cabbage seedlings in comparison with those from plants treated solely with no3
− or higher amounts of nh4
+. the enhancement of photosynthesis and ll tolerance in mini chinese cabbage seedlings supplied with nh4
+:no3
−  is largely attributed to the increase in rbcl, rbcs, fba, fbpase and tk expression .
