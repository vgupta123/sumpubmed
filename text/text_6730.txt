BACKGROUND
red raspberry  is an important fruit crop grown world-wide in the northern and southern hemispheres; black raspberry  is a specialty crop grown mainly in the pacific northwest of the united states. interest in improvement of these crops is increasing in light of studies on their nutritional and nutraceutical value . development of new cultivars can benefit from reliable markers linked to important traits, including disease resistance, flowering traits, fruit quality characteristics, and plant architecture. because interspecific hybridization was widely used by caneberry breeders  <cit> , markers that are transferrable between black and red raspberry and even between raspberry and blackberry would be especially useful. in addition, transferable rubus markers could further illuminate mechanisms of sub-genomic organization in hybrids between disomic and polysomic species  <cit> . very few molecular markers exist for rubus in general  and fewer are transferable between species . several genetic linkage maps composed of various types of molecular markers are available for raspberry , and one is available for blackberry  <cit> , however, not all marker types used to construct these maps are transferable between taxa. many more rubus molecular markers and other genomic tools are needed to map important traits, facilitate cultivar development, maintain cultivar identity, and study basic genetic and genomic mechanisms.

molecular markers designed from simple sequence repeats , tandem repeats of 1– <dig> nucleotides that frequently show co-dominant inheritance, are known to be highly variable even within species, and are transferable across taxa to a varying extent  <cit> . gene-based ssr loci derived from expressed sequence tag  are significantly more transferable across large taxonomic distances compared with genomic ssrs  <cit> . this feature makes est-ssrs superior for comparative linkage mapping and interspecific cross-verification and manipulation of genomic regions associated with phenotypic traits . however, est resources available for the genus rubus at the national center for biotechnology information’s  genbank are scarce with only  <dig> and  <dig> cdna sequences for r. idaeus and r. occidentalis, respectively . a main impetus for this sequencing project was to generate a useful set of est-ssr markers to enable further genetic research into the raspberry genome, and to increase the number of dna sequences available for the rosaceae research community and raspberry breeders. est-ssrs reported here can significantly advance comparative linkage analysis among rubus species.

RESULTS
red raspberry cdna library construction and ssr discovery
a red raspberry cdna library of  <dig>  clones  was produced from rubus idaeus cv. heritage  <cit> . ‘heritage’ is a widely grown, everbearing cultivar with resistance to most common raspberry diseases, and medium to large sized fruit with good color, flavor, firmness and freezing quality  <cit> . the cdna library was prepared from the newly emerging leaves of a single plant. a cdna library subset consisting of  <dig> clones was sequenced with sanger technology  <cit>   yielding  <dig> high quality sequences after removal of sequence shorter than  <dig> base pairs  reported as accession numbers jz <dig> through jz <dig> in genbank. the resulting sequences had an average length of 429 bp and an average phred quality score  <cit>  of  <dig>  transcripts derived from the same expressed gene sequence were assembled into  <dig> contiguous sequences  and  <dig> singletons, yielding a unique gene sequence or “unigene” of  <dig> sequences, thus reducing locus redundancy and inflation of marker numbers derived from a single locus.

a search for ssr loci within the unigenes using the ssr mining script tool found in the toolbox on the genome database for rosaceae  <cit>  identified  <dig> short, perfect repeats in the unigene sequences, which are candidate regions for high polymorphism. trimers, 3 bp repeats, are more common repeat lengths for gene coding regions, likely because their increase or decrease in repeat number does not cause a reading frame shift  <cit> . this dataset did demonstrate this tendency with 30 % dimers , 44 % trimers , 20 % tetramers  and 6 % pentamers . primers were designed to facilitate the amplification of the ssr loci, yielding  <dig> primer pairs suitable for testing  <dig> individual unigenes .

black raspberry cdna library construction and ssr discovery
rubus occidentalis cv. bristol  <cit>  was chosen for construction of the black raspberry transcript library. ‘bristol’ fruit ripen early, are medium sized and firm with excellent flavor; plants are susceptible to anthracnose and tolerant to powdery mildew  <cit> . the cdna library was prepared from the newly emerging leaves of a single plant. the same number of cdna clones was produced as for ‘heritage’,  <dig> . because of expected low polymorphism rate in black raspberry ,  <dig> clones were sequenced with a final yield of  <dig> high quality sequences after quality control analysis, reported as accession numbers jz <dig> through jz <dig> in genbank. these sequences averaged 523 bp with an average phred score of  <dig>  the assembly consisted of  <dig> unigenes .

a total of  <dig> ssr sequences were identified and showed a very similar composition to the red raspberry motif lengths: 35 % dimers, 40 % trimers, 21 % tetramers and 5 % pentamers. the final set of  <dig> primer pairs covers  <dig> unigenes .

the percentages of each motif are generally as expected in plants  <cit> , and a high percentage of tetramers is not uncommon in plants  <cit> . an elevated number of tetramer repeats is thought to be an indication that the majority of this motif length may be found in non-coding regions of the expressed genes  <cit> .

amplification using designed primer pairs
a random selection of ssr loci was tested for pcr amplification, amplification of a polymorphic pcr product, and transferability between species. a subset of  <dig> primer pairs from the  <dig> designed to test  <dig> individual unigenes identified in red raspberry, and  <dig> primer pairs from the  <dig> designed to test  <dig> unigenes identified in black raspberry were assessed using two genotypes each of r. idaeus  and r. occidentalis .

table  <dig> summarizes the results of the amplification test. of the  <dig> primer pairs tested that were designed from r. idaeus sequences,  <dig> pairs amplified a product,  <dig> of which produced a polymorphic product in r. idaeus. of the  <dig> primer pairs designed from r. occidentalis sequences,  <dig> pairs amplified a product,  <dig> of which produced a polymorphic product in r. occidentalis. of the  <dig> total primer pairs tested,  <dig>  produced amplification products that could be used to distinguish between the two species. in general, number and size range of alleles produced were similar between the two species. in terms of transferability,  <dig> of the  <dig> primer pairs  designed from r. idaeus sequence amplified a product in r. occidentalis,  <dig>  of which were polymorphic in r. occidentalis. transferability from r. occidentalis to r. idaeus was demonstrated with  <dig> of the  <dig> primer pairs  amplifying a product of which  <dig>  detected polymorphisms in r. idaeus. these results indicate that markers that amplify a polymorphic product in highly-homozygous black raspberry are likely to amplify a polymorphic product in red raspberry, regardless of the sequence source.table  <dig> summary of results for a subset of primer pairs designed for  <dig> expressed sequence tag  loci derived from red raspberry  and black raspberry  sequences. primer pairs were evaluated for the production of polymorphic pcr products and the ability to distinguish between the two species. amplicon sizes are in base pairs . those primer pairs with unclear results are indicated as “unk”



sequence functional characterization
the main reason for creating the rubus libraries and sequence resources was for marker discovery; however, functional annotation of the sequences is a useful supplement for mapping efforts. functional annotation allows investigators to target specific functional signatures of interest when testing molecular markers and allows the application of the sequences in a broader range of research questions. the functional information also provides a quality check for the library; we expect to see almost all sequences matching a model plant species and spanning a diversity of functions characteristic of leaf tissue. for this purpose, we chose to combine the transcripts from the two raspberry libraries into a single unigene set to provide the maximum amount of information about genes expressed in raspberry leaves and get the longest possible transcripts for searching and comparing to other genes. the combined raspberry unigene set has  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons for a total of  <dig> unigenes. the number of combined contigs was less than the sum of the contigs from the two datasets used for ssr identification, as identical contigs derived from both rubus species were combined.

a basic local alignment search tool   <cit>  comparison of the  <dig> unigenes to the non-redundant  protein database from the ncbi  <cit>  yielded matches for  <dig> unigenes . only six of these  had a best match to an organism outside of green plants. the majority,  <dig>  had a best match to a plant in the rosid clade . this confirms that the library has little, if any, contamination with microbes from either the sampling or laboratory procedures.fig.  <dig> a basic local alignment search tool  comparison of the  <dig> combined black and red raspberry unigene set to the non-redundant  protein database from the national center for biotechnology information . results indicate that the majority of the unigenes aligned to genera in the rosid clade



the unigene set was aligned to the gene ontology  database  <cit>  and classified according to the three basic categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component . the most abundant sub-level two go category was biological process with a total of  <dig> sequences associated with metabolic processes , cellular processes , and single organism processes . other representative terms of biological process were response to stimulus , localization , and biological regulation  . go assignments for the category molecular function totaled  <dig> sequences with functions for catalytic activity , binding , and structural molecule activity  . go assignments for the category cellular component totaled  <dig> sequences assigned to cell part  and organelle  . a more detailed view of the go sub-levels 3– <dig> reveals a significant fraction of genes related to metabolic processes such as macromolecule metabolism, organic substance metabolism, biosynthetic processes, and nitrogen/phosphorus metabolism . within the category molecular function, binding-related sub-categories such as cation binding, ion binding, and nucleoside binding were enriched. finally, within the category cellular component, membrane, macromolecular complex, and symplast sub-categories were enriched . contig lengths ranged from 124 bp–1465 bp with an average length of 558 bp. to provide an example of functional diversity we aligned the ten longest unigenes to the go database and identified a diversity of gene functions including heat shock, protease activity, and photosynthetic function . all these annotations are reasonable for a set of genes from a plant leaf, and demonstrate the diversity of activities that were identified from a small set of ests.fig.  <dig> the unigene set was aligned to the gene ontology  database  <cit>  and classified according to the three basic categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. the most abundant level  <dig> go category was biological process with a total of  <dig> sequences associated with metabolic processes , cellular processes , and single organism processes . other representative terms of biological process were response to stimulus , localization , and biological regulation  . go assignments for the category molecular function totaled  <dig> sequences with functions for catalytic activity , binding , and structural molecule activity  . go assignments for the category cellular component totaled  <dig> sequences assigned to cell part  and organelle  



reference genomes have been published from members of the rosaceae: diploid strawberry   <cit> , which is in the same subfamily  as raspberry  <cit> , double haploid peach   <cit> , apple   <cit> , european pear   <cit> , and asian pear   <cit> . if enough sequence conservation exists between these genomes and raspberry, some of these new raspberry-derived markers and primers designed from polymorphic regions may be transferable to the other genera. the gene space in particular should be well conserved; therefore the raspberry unigenes were aligned to the gene sets from strawberry, peach, and apple to evaluate the actual sequence conservation. the best match for each unigene was re-aligned with a smith-waterman search  <cit>  to obtain the best possible alignment. considering all of the best alignments between raspberry and strawberry genes,  <dig>  % of the alignments had greater than 90 % identity; when aligned to the peach genome,  <dig>  % of the matches had a greater than 90 % identity; and for apple genes,  <dig>  % of the matches had greater than 90 % sequence identity. figure  <dig> illustrates this trend for percent identity across all alignments, demonstrating that the raspberry unigenes have an overall higher percent identity to strawberry than to the other two gene sets, which is consistent with their closer phylogenetic relationship.fig.  <dig> the distribution of percent sequence identities from alignments of raspberry unigenes to apple, peach, or strawberry genes. the greater similarity between raspberry and strawberry is a result of their close phylogenetic relationship relative to the other two crops



CONCLUSIONS
we have generated  <dig> and  <dig> est-ssrs derived from leaf tissue of red raspberry  and black raspberry  respectively. we have also designed  <dig> and  <dig> primer pairs for red and black raspberry, respectively. this resource constitutes a first step toward developing rubus-specific, gene-derived markers that will facilitate the construction of linkage maps comprised of transferable markers for studying and manipulating important traits. the utility of some of these markers has been demonstrated already in the works of dossett et al.  <dig>  <cit>  and bushakra et al.  <dig>  <cit> , where some were used to evaluate genetic diversity among a wide selection of black raspberry genotypes and in genetic linkage map construction, respectively.

the advent of inexpensive next generation sequencing technologies has led to an increase in the use of snp markers derived from high-throughput methods such as genotyping by sequencing   <cit>  and restriction site associated dna  tags  <cit> . however, we argue that the long-utilized ssr is still the most effective and efficient marker type in certain circumstances. high-throughput sequencing costs are often reported as attractively low, but additional significant costs are associated with optimizing the restriction enzyme-based dna preparations for a new species of interest, applying an appropriate informatics pipeline to manage the huge amount of sequence data, and finally to call the snps from an often “sparse” resulting data matrix  <cit> . the same statistical power can be achieved with many fewer multiallelic ssrs than with biallelic snps derived from the complex gbs process. in the case of rubus spp., where a reference genome is not yet available, the lack of key informatics poses an even more significant barrier to sequence-based snp assays, such as the inability to align the snps to a reference, which requires additional work to assemble the sequencing reads. also, specific to the rubus spp. system, multiple species often are utilized and crossed in breeding programs. ssrs are significantly more likely than snps to transfer between species with little to no additional informatics investment. considering the significant advantages, we selected ssrs as the best tool for straightforward yet effective genetic marker studies in rubus species.
