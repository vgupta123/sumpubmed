BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is a major health problem with a high mortality worldwide  <cit> . during the infection, mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to remain dormant in the human host without causing active disease for prolonged periods. despite the importance of latency in the epidemiology and pathology of tb, it is not clear how m. tuberculosis controls the latent state in human host. however, to achieve, maintain, or escape from the latent state, m. tuberculosis must carefully regulate cell division by sensing and responding to specific signals in the host environment. to successfully complete this essential process, the m. tuberculosis genome contains a wide variety of transcription regulators, surface receptors, and signaling molecules including eleven "eukaryotic-type" ser/thr protein kinases   <cit> . we previously showed that two of these kinases, pkna and pknb, are key components of a signal transduction pathway that regulates cell morphology  <cit> . one substrate of these kinases we identified is wag <dig>  a homolog of the cell-division protein diviva in other gram-positive bacteria  <cit> .

diviva functions in cell division in many gram-positive bacteria, but the specific roles it plays vary in a species-specific manner. for instance, bacillus subtilis diviva has dual functions in this microorganism: it is required for appropriate septum placement by confining the mincd cell division inhibitory complex at the cell poles in vegetative cells, and it facilitates chromosome segregation by interacting with the oric complex in sporulating cells  <cit> . in contrast, diviva in streptomyces coelicolor is essential for hyphal tip growth, and diviva homologs in corynebacterium glutamicum and brevibacterium lactofermentum are localized to the cell poles and are required for their polar growth  <cit> .

we, and others, recently demonstrated that wag <dig> is an essential gene, and that wag <dig> is localized at the cell poles in mycobacterial cells  <cit> . we further showed that the partial depletion of wag <dig> causes dramatic morphological changes indicative of defects in polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and that wag <dig> and nascent peptidoglycan biosynthesis co-localize at the cell poles, suggesting an important role of wag <dig> in polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis in mycobacterium smegmatis  <cit> . finally, expression of phosphomimetic m. tuberculosis wag <dig>  in the wag31msm deletion mutant of m. smegmatis showed higher growth rate than cells expressing wild-type wag31mtb or phosphoablative wag31t73amtb  <cit> . while wag31mtb appears to have a role in the protection of mycobacterial cells under stress conditions  <cit> , these observations strongly suggested that wag <dig> and its phosphorylation plays a critical role in modulating cell growth through regulating peptidoglycan biosynthesis in mycobacteria.

in the present report, we further characterize the role of wag <dig> phosphorylation. we show that the differential growth caused by the expression of different wag31mtb alleles  is due to, at least in part, dissimilar nascent peptidoglycan biosynthesis. we further show that the phosphorylation state of wag <dig> is important for protein-protein interaction between the wag31mtb molecules, and thus, for its polar localization. in line with these findings, we observe a higher enzymatic activity  of peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway in cells expressing phosphomimetic wag31t73emtb than cells expressing wild-type wag31mtb or phosphoablative wag31t73amtb.

RESULTS
phosphorylation of wag <dig> affects the polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis in mycobacteria
previously, we constructed a conditional wag31msm mutant of m. smegmatis to demonstrate that wag <dig> is an essential gene  <cit> . when the phosphomimetic wag <dig> allele of m. tuberculosis , as a sole source of wag <dig>  was expressed in this mutant, a higher growth rate  was observed than cells expressing wild-type wag31mtb , and cells expressing the phosphoablative wag31t73amtb allele showed the lowest growth rate   <cit> . since wag <dig> had been suggested to play a role in polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis  <cit> , we tested whether the differential growth phenotype among these strains was due to, at least in part, a difference in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. to investigate this, we cultured those m. smegmatis wag31msm deletion mutants expressing wag31mtb , wag31t73amtb  or wag31t73emtb  until mid-log phase, and stained with vancomycin-alexa <dig> conjugate  to examine by fluorescence microscopy with fixed exposure time and diaphragm aperture settings. fluorescent vancomycin binds to the terminal d-ala-d-ala portion of unincorporated, or incorporated but uncross-linked, peptidoglycan precursors on the cell surface, and thus has been used to identify the sites of nascent peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . van-alexa <dig> signals from the polar regions of the cells expressing wag31t73emtb was approximately four-fold higher than those expressing wag31t73amtb . cells expressing the wild-type wag31mtb allele showed an intermediate intensity of van-alexa <dig> signals, consistent with its growth phenotype  <cit> . thus, this result suggests that the phosphorylation state of wag <dig> either regulates polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis, possibly by directly or indirectly affecting enzyme in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway, or affects the level of cross-linking of peptidoglycan leaving non-crosslinked d-ala-d-ala.

protein-protein interactions and polar localization of wag <dig> molecules are affected by phosphorylation
the diviva protein from b. subtilis forms oligomers that assemble into a highly ordered two-dimensional network, which is proposed to create the cell polarity needed for sporulation or tip extension  <cit> . more recently, in vivo and in vitro cross-linking experiments showed that wag <dig> also forms homo-oligomers in m. bovis bcg  <cit> . because our previous and current findings suggest that the phosphorylation of wag <dig> play a regulatory role in polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis  <cit> , we hypothesized that the phosphorylation state of wag <dig> may affect its oligomerization at the cell poles by modulating interactions between wag <dig> molecules, which in turn influence the peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the polar location.

to address this hypothesis, we first determined whether the phosphorylation of wag <dig> affects the protein-protein interaction between wag <dig> molecules using the yeast two-hybrid system  <cit> . wild-type wag31mtb showed interaction with itself, compatible with the finding of the wag <dig> oligomerization in m. bovis bcg by nguyen et al.  . interestingly, interaction between phosphomimetic wag31t73emtb molecules was approximately two-fold stronger than the one between wild-type wag31mtb molecules or between phosphoablative wag31t73amtb molecules, supporting a role of the phosphorylation in stimulating the interaction between wag <dig> molecules. interaction between wild-type wag <dig> molecules was similar to that of wag31t73a molecules, which is likely the result from lack of phosphorylation of wild-type wag <dig> in the absence of the cognate pkn's in saccharomyces cerevisiae.

based on the yeast two-hybrid result, we predicted that the stronger interaction between the phosphorylated wag <dig> molecules would lead to the enhanced localization of wag <dig> to the polar regions. this prediction was tested by comparing the localization of gfp fused to wag31mtb, wag31t73amtb, or wag31t73emtb in the deletion mutants of wag31msm expressing the corresponding wag <dig> allele . quantification of polar gfp signals revealed that cells with wag31t73emtb have  <dig> -fold higher, and cells with wild-type wag31mtb have  <dig> -fold higher gfp signals than cells with wag31t73amtb , while this increase in polar localization of wild-type wag <dig> and wag31t73e could be, in part, due to altered association of wag <dig> with other unknown molecules. this difference in polar wag31-gfp signals was not due to difference in the expression levels of wag31mtb because approximately equal levels of wag31mtb  relative to the levels of housekeeping sigamsm were found from these stains . in addition, such localization was not seen when gfp alone was expressed, indicating that the gfp-wag <dig> localizations are not a gfp artifact ).

to further confirm the effect of the wag <dig> phosphorylation on its polar localization, we examined the localization of wild-type wag31mtb in the presence or absence of pknamtb- or pknbmtb-overexpression. we previously showed that wag <dig> was weakly phosphorylated by pknamtb, which was significantly enhanced by the addition of pknbmtb in vitro  <cit> . consistent with this, pkna-overexpression only slightly increased the polar localization of wag <dig> and polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis ). however, overexpression of pknbmtb, which dramatically increased the phosphorylation of gfp-wag <dig> , elevated the polar localization of wag <dig>  and nascent peptidoglycan biosynthesis  compared to cells without pknbmtb-overexpression. these data further support that the phosphorylation of wag <dig> enhances its polar localization, which in turn heightens polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis.

phosphorylation of wag <dig> affects the enzymatic activity of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway
bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis is a complex process involving many different cytoplasmic and membrane steps  <cit> . in escherichia coli, the cytoplasmic steps culminate in the formation of the udp-murnac- catalyzed by a series of enzymatic activities of mur proteins . the membrane-associated steps are then initiated with the formation of murnac--diphosphoryl-undecaprenol , a reaction catalyzed by mray  <cit> . in a subsequent step by murg, one glcnac residue is added to lipid i to form glcnac-murnac--diphosphoryl-undecaprenol , which is flipped to the outer surface of the membrane to be incorporated into the preexisting peptidoglycan by penicillin binding proteins. the structure of mycobacterial peptidoglycan is believed to be similar to that of e. coli, although it has a few differences  <cit> . the same appears to be true for its biosynthesis because m. tuberculosis possesses all eight mur genes that are present in e. coli  <cit> .

our results described so far suggest that the phosphorylation of wag <dig> has an influence on cell growth, at least in part, by regulating its polar localization and possibly the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan precursors. these data led us to hypothesize that wag <dig> phosphorylation regulates polar peptidoglycan synthesis by affecting, directly or indirectly, the peptidoglycan synthetic machinery. to address this, the activity of mur enzymes was determined among the wag31msm deletion mutant strains expressing different wag <dig> alleles. we began with measuring the combined activity of mray and murg because these enzymes produce the final membrane-bound disaccharide-pentapeptide product. briefly, a cell envelope-enriched fraction  was purified from the wag <dig> deletion mutant cells expressing wag31mtb, wag31t73amtb, or wag31t73emtb , incubated with udp-murnac-pentapeptide , atp and udp-glcnac, and then the reaction product of murg -diphosphoryl-undecaprenol, lipid ii) was analyzed by tlc  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that the p <dig> fraction from cells expressing wag31t73emtb produced  <dig> -fold more 14c-labeled lipid ii, but cells with wag31t73amtb yielded 30% less of this product than cells expressing wild-type wag31mtb. in a repeated experiment with independently purified p <dig> fractions, a similar result was observed  . these data suggested that the wag <dig> phosphorylation, directly or indirectly, regulates the combined activity of mray and murg.

consistent with this finding, we recently found in a raman spectroscopic analyses that cells containing wag31t73emtb allele had increased intensity of the raman peaks that have previously been attributed to d-glutamic acid, d-alanine, and n-acetylglucosamine components of peptidoglycan  <cit>  than cells expressing wild-type wag31mtb, which in turn showed higher intensity of the these peaks than cells with wag31t73amtb  <cit> . an increase in the intensity of these peaks suggests an increase in the quantity of these molecules, thus peptidoglycan in the cell. a corresponding pattern in the intensity of these peaks was also seen in the raman spectra from the p <dig> cell envelope-enriched fractions, indicating that the increase of these molecules is localized in the membrane.

discussion
our current results provide insights into a novel mechanism for the regulation of polar peptidoglycan synthesis in mycobacteria via differential polar localization of wag <dig> depending on its phosphorylation status. this mechanism of the signal transduction system involving the wag <dig> phosphorylation may be widespread among gram-positive bacteria containing diviva because recent studies demonstrated that diviva in streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae is also phosphorylated even though its function is yet to be discovered  <cit> . since some bacteria such as mycobacterium and corynebacterium species lack mreb  <cit>  but have a rod-like shape, and insert peptidoglycan at the cell poles instead of the helical pattern that uses actin-like mreb homologues, our data also suggest that wag <dig> could serve as a determinant that directs peptidoglycan synthesis to the poles in mycobacterial cells. interestingly, a recent study in c. glutamicum found that pknacglu phosphorylates, and thereby regulates, the activity of murc  <cit> . in addition, in m. tuberculosis, glmu, which catalyzes the formation of udp-glcnac , is phosphorylated by pknamtb and pknbmtb in vitro  <cit> , and another enzyme, murd, is phosphorylated by pknamtb  <cit> . these findings suggest that pknamtb and pknbmtb kinases are key regulatory components that modulate peptidoglycan biosynthesis and cell growth in mycobacteria via many targets including wag <dig> and mur enzymes.

what is the molecular mechanism by which wag <dig> and its phosphorylation regulate the activity of peptidoglycan synthetic enzymes? protein sequence alignments of wag <dig> with diviva homologs revealed two conserved coiled-coil regions at the n- and c-termini, which are interrupted by a highly variable sequence, which includes the phosphorylation site of wag <dig>  <cit> . coiled-coil domains are known to function in protein-protein interactions  <cit> , and the two coiled-coil regions in wag <dig> may be responsible for the formation of oligomers of wag <dig> in vitro and the potential superstructure in vivo as proposed  <cit> . these facts, taken together with our current finding of the phosphorylation-dependent localization of wag <dig> thus tempted us to propose that the recruitment of wag <dig> to the cell poles, which is mediated by interactions between coiled-coil regions of wag <dig> molecules and is enhanced by the phosphorylation, modulates, directly or indirectly, the activity of peptidoglycan synthetic enzymes such as mray and murg. it is not clear, however, whether wag <dig> affects these enzymes through direct interactions since we failed to detect the interactions between mur enzymes and wag <dig>  in the yeast two-hybrid or mycobacterial protein fragment complementation system  <cit> . in addition, we were not able to reconstitute an assay system to test the effect of the wag <dig> phosphorylation on the enzymatic activity of mray and murg in vitro because we could not purify these enzymes in e. coli, due to the toxicity of these enzymes when overexpressed. these negative results, however, suggested that the localization, and thus the activity, of wag <dig> in vivo in m. tuberculosis is probably under tight regulation that involves multiple players.

in our previous studies, we showed that wag <dig> is mainly phosphorylated during exponential phase where transcription of the pkna/bmtb operon is high, and remains non- or lowly-phosphorylated during stationary phase as transcription of the pkna/bmtb operon drops  <cit> . thus, our current data support the following model. when mycobacterial cells are growing rapidly as in exponential phase, wag <dig> is phosphorylated by the pkna/bmtb kinases and strongly recruited to the cell poles to facilitate peptidoglycan biosynthesis so that enough peptidoglycan is produced to meet the demands of fast growth. it is possible that pknbmtb senses this favorable external condition by detecting muropeptides through its pasta repeats and regulates peptidoglycan biosynthesis through wag <dig>  because, in b. subtilis, the prkc kinase, a homolog of pknbmtb with three pasta domains, induces germination in response to muropeptide fragments released by surrounding growing bacteria  <cit> . in stationary phase, however, wag <dig> remains non- or lowly-phosphorylated but can still be recruited to the cell poles and lead to polar peptidoglycan synthesis. this idea is consistent with our observation that the phosphoablative wag31t73a does localize at the cell poles , and that wild-type gfp-wag <dig> shows clear localization and peptidoglycan biosynthesis at cell poles at late stationary phase, albeit lower than in exponential phase . this model is also consistent with previous reports that a fairly high capacity for peptidoglycan biosynthesis is maintained in slow-growing and stationary phase bacterial cells  <cit> . either way, wag <dig> itself is essential for mycobacterial survival as we observed in our previous report  <cit>  because wag <dig> must be present and localized to the cell poles for polar peptidoglycan synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that wag31mtb phosphorylation, which is unique among diviva homologues, regulates polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis and optimal growth of mycobacterial cells through modulating the localization of wag <dig> and the activity of peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes.
