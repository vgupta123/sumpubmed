BACKGROUND
placental mammals display a great deal of variation in many life history traits including maximum longevity and body mass. a correlation between certain life history traits has been observed with larger mammals tending towards longer life spans  <cit> , figure  <dig>  certain species do not adhere to this general rule and exhibit extreme longevity with respect to their body size. the naked mole rat and the microbat myotis lucifugus have a maximum longevity of 31 years and 34 years, but with small body sizes of 35 g and 10 g respectively  <cit>  they are out of line with their expected longevity, figure  <dig>  in addition to this, both species do not exhibit the same age related deterioration such as hearing loss or reduced reproductive capabilities that are associated with human senescence  <cit> . for these reasons, both naked mole rat and microbat  have been proposed as candidate study species to further our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning increased longevity and senescence  <cit> . naked mole rats, microbats and human have all evolved increased life-spans but the underlying selective pressures leading to this extreme life history trait are most likely complex and varied.

since the mid 1950s the role of natural selection in senescence has been debated  <cit>  as reviewed by kirkwood and austad  <cit> , and there is agreement that variation in longevity is potentially in response to predation risk  <cit> . microbats have a niche advantage in that flight has reduced the range of predators possible  <cit> . this reduced risk of predation is thought to be a major contributing factor in the evolution of extended life-span. the naked mole rat lives in a subterranean habitat and is therefore largely protected from predation  <cit>  but they are also a eusocial mammal. it is now recognised that social effects influence longevity and considering longevity in a kin-selection framework this places the eusocial naked mole rat with a strong selective pressure for increased longevity in a niche with reduced predation risk. in humans it has been proposed that increased life span is the result of selective pressure to provide care for dependents to increase their fitness . indeed, even within species of anthropoid primates there is variation in longevity depending on the levels of care provided by the male or female, e.g. in species where the female provides the majority of care they have longer lifespans in comparison to males  <cit> . the 'disposable-soma’ theory of ageing predicts that reducing the extrinsic mortality risk, e.g. due to reducing predation, means a species can make substantial investments in growth and 'somatic maintenance’ as they will have more opportunities to reproduce, this is in contrast to a species with high mortality risk, that typically invest more in early reproduction than maintenance  <cit> . species with low extrinsic mortality risk should also select against late onset deleterious mutations and these should therefore not accumulate with age  <cit> . likewise, antagonistic pleiotropy caused by mutations that are beneficial early in life but have negative benefits later in life should not have the same effects in species with low mortality risks  <cit> . selective pressures to improve the fitness of the next generation in reduced predation environments can result in increased longevity by adaptation of a variety of genes. studying species with varying extrinsic mortality risks and divergent life spans should enable a better understanding of the molecular processes involved in ageing.

in  <dig>  blackburn, grieder and stostak won the nobel prize for discovering that repetitive elements on the end of chromosomes  maintain chromosome integrity and that the enzyme telomerase maintains these telomeres. in linear chromosomes, telomeres are crucial “ttaggg” repeat structures that protect the tips of chromosomes in both somatic and germ line cells. telomerase along with a suite of dna repair, telomere binding and chromatin regulators , are key regulators of these protective caps, see review  <cit> . the telomere repeat sequence “ttaggg”, while conserved across vertebrates, can vary in length, for example humans have ~10-15 kb of telomere sequence at the tips of their chromosomes, while mice have approximately ~20-50 kb of telomere sequence  <cit> . telomeres typically shorten during each cell division in the absence of telomerase expression, eventually reaching a critical length, which triggers cell death. this process is known as 'replicative senescence’  <cit> . maintenance of telomere length directly impacts the regenerative capacity of stem cells, and has been associated with premature ageing diseases such as werner’s syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia and dyskeratosis congenita  <cit> . however, recent debate has centered on whether telomere length is correlated with body size rather than life span thereby calling into question the direct role of telomere length in chronological ageing  <cit> . here we sought to determine if there were lineage-specific patterns of evolution in the proteins responsible for telomere length and maintenance unique to those lineages with extended longevity.

adaptation at the molecular level is estimated by the ratio of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site  to synonymous substitutions per synonymous sites , referred to as ω throughout. an ω value of <  <dig> indicates that a gene is undergoing purifying selection, an ω value =  <dig> is indicative of genetic drift or neutral evolution, while ω >  <dig> signifies positive selection. the relationship between positive selection and protein functional shift has been validated biochemically through the rational mutagenesis of various fungal, plant and mammal enzymes  <cit> . whilst positive selection has been reported for between 38% and 62% of protein coding genes in mammals  <cit> , it is generally held that the majority of codon positions are evolving neutrally or under purifying selection  <cit> .

signatures for adaptive evolution have been shown for regulatory regions and protein-coding genes  <cit> . in the case of protein coding regions the genes implicated are frequently those that have emerged through gene duplication  <cit> . gene duplication is a well-known source for new gene function  <cit>  although the precise mechanism of neofunctionalization remains debated  <cit> . in general it is observed that most duplicates tend to become subfunctionalized or pseudogenized in the absence of purifying selection  <cit> . recombination can introduce variability to populations  <cit>  and can also influence the process of natural selection  <cit> . non-adaptive evolutionary forces  are also major contributing factors in shaping gene evolution  <cit>  and should also be considered.

here we assess whether there is enrichment for positive selection in lineages with increased longevity, i.e. the naked mole rat, m. lucifugus and human in those genes responsible for telomere maintenance and integrity. we determine species-specific patterns of adaptive evolution in microbat, naked mole rat, and human and we explore the molecular adaptations that have occurred uniquely in the human lineage using population level data.

RESULTS
the  <dig> telomere associated genes for this study  <cit>  were clustered into  <dig> gene families across  <dig> placental mammals and  <dig> outgroup species . multiple sequence alignments  were generated using both distance and evolutionary aware methods  <cit>  ensuring a comprehensive exploration of alignment space. sequences with less than 60% coverage over the entire length of the msa, or individual columns that did not have 60% minimum coverage across a position, were removed using trimal  <cit> , giving a final dataset of  <dig> gene family alignments for further analyses. these gene families were composed of  <dig> multigene families,  <dig> families that contained lineage-specific gene duplications and  <dig> single gene orthologous families. all msas were of good quality   <cit> , ranging between 786 bp and 5514 bp in length and contained between  <dig> and  <dig> species. the profile of the dataset is described in additional file  <dig> 

adaptive and non-adaptive mechanisms shape the evolution of telomere associated genes
codon models of evolution were applied to the  <dig> gene families using codeml  <cit> . the cladec model  <cit>  allows for a labeled branch or clade to have different selective pressure acting in the foreground and the background, thus providing a framework for the subtle detection of divergent evolution among clades. the cladec model was compared against the m2_rel model  <cit>  and significance was assessed by comparing twice the difference in likelihood scores  to the chi-squared table based on the degrees of freedom between the two models. we controlled for false discovery rates using the benjamini-hochberg procedure  <cit>  and we adjusted the p-values accordingly. using this procedure the lrts between cladec v m2_rel, modela v modelanull, and modela v m1neutral were deemed significant if the adjusted p value  <  <dig> , see additional file  <dig>  the branch-site modela  <cit>  allows for positive selection to occur in the labeled foreground branch while on all other branches , positive selection is not permitted. modela is compared to null models m1neutral and modelanull, and significance is assessed using the same method as described for the cladec model. the posterior probability  of positively selected sites was estimated using the bayes empirical bayes  method  <cit> . to minimize the detection of false positives only sites where a pp >  <dig>  are listed . by applying both model types to our data we can  assess the heterogeneity of divergent evolution across clades, and  obtain a profile of the proportion of species that have undergone positive selection in their telomere associated genes.

the cladec model indicates a large proportion of lineages in the analysis have undergone divergent evolution with 19/ <dig> genes calculated has having between  <dig> and  <dig> branches diverging with an ω value >  <dig>  while the remaining branches are diverging with ω < or =  <dig>  this result highlights the heterogeneity in divergence rates across lineages. we then tested our data using lineage-site model a and identified positive selection in 24/ <dig> placental mammals across 48/ <dig> of the gene families tested, for summary of results see figure  <dig> and additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the effect of saturation at the synonymous level  on ω estimates has been debated in the literature  <cit> . recent studies have shown that ds saturation is more likely to contribute to loss of power in the analysis rather than increased false positive discovery  <cit> . we have estimated the ds level across our data using the yang and nielsen  method in the paml v.  <dig>   <cit>  and found  <dig> genes with evidence of saturation at silent sites. these  <dig> genes are therefore likely to have reduced power but they have been retained in all subsequent analyses as they are unlikely to produce false positive results. trees estimated from ds have been made available in additional file  <dig>  the mean percentage of genes with signatures of positive selection was estimated at  <dig> %± <dig> . there were outliers such as the guinea pig where a large proportion  of the homologs from this lineage displayed signatures of positive selection, on the other hand there were lineages such as cat and pika where none of the homologs had evidence of positive selection.

we tested the hypothesis that increased longevity, body mass, or the ratio of longevity to body mass were correlated with increased levels of positive selection using a pearson correlation. comparisons of the percentage of genes under selection across mammals showed weak negative correlation at the 10% significance level when compared to longevity  and no correlation when compared to body mass  or longevity to body mass ratio . to correct for the influence of gene length on our results, and rather than simply comparing the number of sites to the life history traits of interest, we also compared the life history traits with the proportion of sites under positive selection as a function of gene length. the results were similar to those obtained using the raw positively selected gene counts: longevity , body mass , and the longevity to body mass ratio .

non-adaptive processes such as recombination have been shown to dramatically influence the evolutionary trajectory of a protein sequence  <cit> , but they can also create signatures that mimic positive selection. recombination events were detected in 47/ <dig> of genes in the dataset, and in all lineages. it is difficult to tease apart signatures for positive selection from recombination as accurate break point detection in recombination analysis is difficult  <cit> , and these processes are not mutually exclusive with positive selection known to occur within recombinant regions  <cit> . therefore, the genes with evidence of recombination were not discarded from the analysis, they were analysed for selective pressure variation and the positions of recombined and positively selected sites were compared. it is clear that the interactions between adaptive and non-adaptive events are complex and further development of methods is required to adequately tease apart the effects of these evolutionary processes  <cit> . we have reported our findings in additional file  <dig> but cannot discount the possibility that both processes are acting on these genes simultaneously.

naked mole rat-specific positive selection
we tested  <dig> gene families where the naked mole rat lineage was labeled as foreground,  <dig> of these were significant for differential divergence rates under the cladec model, with  <dig> of these genes  evolving under positive selection. lineage-specific selective pressure analysis under modela identified  <dig> genes under positive selection: ankd <dig>  abl <dig>  fance, msh <dig>  fanca, slx <dig>  brac <dig>  xrcc <dig> and fancl, none of which overlap with positively selected genes in m. lucifugus or human. interestingly, all of the positively selected genes were involved in dna repair. three of these positively selected genes: brca <dig>  fance, and fanca, work together in response to dna damage in the fanconi anaemia/brca pathway  and brca <dig> has been shown to play a crucial role in telomere maintenance  <cit> . we mapped the positively selected sites from naked mole rat for brca <dig> to amino acid positions in the human brca <dig> ortholog to extract functional information . the seven positively selected sites occur in close proximity to one another, all are located within the zinc finger domain - crucial for protein-protein interactions  <cit> , and all are adjacent to natural variants associated with cancer in humans. in the naked mole rate lineage there was no positive selection identified in genes involved in telomere-binding and insufficient sequence data was available to test the telomerase components.

microbat -specific positive selection
in total there were  <dig> sequence alignments with m. lucifugus representation, these were analysed using the cladec model and  <dig> showed evidence of differential divergence in the microbat lineage. the first of these two genes, ankhd <dig>  did not show evidence of positive selection. however, dkc <dig> was identified as being positively selected and with an ω value of  <dig> . the dck <dig> protein is a component of the telomerase enzyme that directly maintains telomere length  <cit> . missense mutations in this gene result in x-linked dyskeratosis congenital   <cit> , a congenital disorder that causes pre-mature ageing. there were no individual sites using the beb calculation that had a pp >  <dig>  of being positively selected under the cladec model, therefore we applied modela to gain more site-specific information.

within the m. lucifugus lineage, modela identified 10/ <dig> gene families as evolving under positive selection: ankhd <dig>  rbl <dig>  tnks, dkc <dig>  nbn, exo <dig>  brca <dig>  brip <dig>  suv39h <dig>  tert. previous analyses have proposed the brca <dig> gene as under positive selection in the myotis davidii species  <cit> . to determine the functional importance of positive selection on these genes we mapped the m. lucifugus positively selected sites in dkc <dig> and tert to the orthologous positions in the human - swiss-prot sequences o <dig> and o <dig> respectively, see figure  <dig>  the majority of positively selected sites  in the m. lucifugus lineage for the dkc <dig> gene map to the pua  domain involved in rna modification  <cit> . within this region, natural variants associated with xdkc are also found, this is a disorder involving defective telomere maintenance  <cit>  . in the m. lucifugus tert gene, there were  <dig> sites identified as being positively selected . this gene has been well characterized and we were able to map these positively selected sites to functionally important regions. as shown in figure 4b, region  and  of the tert protein are required for oligomerization and rna-interacting domain  <dig>  essential for interacting with another telomerease component  and for dna synthesis. within this region we identified two sites under positive selection. the remaining positively selected sites were identified in either region  or  of the tert protein both of which are critical regions in telomere maintenance as they are required for reverse transcriptase and oligomerization activity respectively. mutagenesis studies have been carried out on the human tert to identify regions that result in reduced telomerase activity, sites implicated are: d868a, d869a and positions 930– <dig>  <cit> , and these fall within close proximity to the sites identified in m. lucifugus as positively selected. this provides us with strong evidence that this 'hot spot’ of positive selection in m. lucifugus tert may have tangible functional impact on altered telomere maintenance in this species.

human-specific positive selection
two genes were identified as being positively selected in the human population using modela with p-adj <  <dig> . to address whether the signatures of divergent evolution are manifest within modern human populations we examined the pattern of segregation of single nucleotide polymorphisms  occurring in all genes that were predicted to have signatures of positive selection in the human lineage. we used hapmap data for east asian , northern and western european , and african yoruba  populations and estimated the integrated haplotype score   <cit>  for each population using the snp@evolution database  <cit> . the ihs is a measure of segregation of an allele within a population, ihs scores > + <dig> indicates that the allele is segregating in the population  while an ihs score < - <dig> indicates that the allele is reducing in frequency  <cit> .

using the modela suite of lrts we identified mre11a, and ercc <dig> as having signatures of positive selection , but there were no snp data available for these two genes and therefore a population level analysis was not possible. we found that the wrn gene displayed evidence of positive selection  with a p-adj =  <dig> . although this p-adj value is higher than previously set, we believe that the higher quality data for human merits further exploration of this gene using available snp data, the results are described below.

myotis lucifugus 
the results summarized here are only those that were significant following lrt analyses of modela versus m1neutral model, and modelanull for human, naked mole rat and m. lucifugus. the names of the genes identified in each species as having undergone positive selection are given . the number of gene families identified as under positive selection in each species is represented along with the total number of families tested for that species.

under the cladec model we identified one gene that showed evidence of differential divergence in the human lineage with p-adj <  <dig> , rad51d . examining a more relaxed cut-off criteria of p-adj <  <dig> , both wrn  and rbl <dig>  displayed evidence of positive selection for the species-level comparison under with the cladec model. we performed further analysis on rbl <dig> and wrn to determine whether these genes are under ongoing positive selection or whether these sites are fixed in all modern human populations.

myotis lucifugus 
the significant cladec versus m2_rel model lrt analysis are summarised. results for both positive selection  and divergent purifying selection  are shown for the three species of interest.

the wrn gene is associated with a disorder of premature ageing called werner syndrome  <cit>  and it showed evidence for positive selection under both lineage specific suites of lrts applied in this study. the population level analysis revealed that wrn had an ihs > + <dig>  indicating a continued positive selective pressure acting on this gene in modern humans with two independently segregating alleles in both the european  and african yoruba  populations . rbl <dig> was analysed in a similar way but showed no evidence of ongoing positive selective pressure .

in total nine genes were estimated to have signatures of divergent evolution under the cladec model, on analysis of the human population level data five showed significant levels of segregation , table  <dig> shows a summary of the number of associated snps in each case. these results indicate that there are detectable levels of positive and negative selection acting within modern human populations for genes involved in telomere maintenance. these genes have fundamental roles in key processes that maintain genome integrity, i.e. dna repair  and chromatin regulation .

CONCLUSIONS
there have been many competing hypotheses proposed to explain the observed variation in longevity and ageing in animals, yet molecular evolutionary studies have been lacking. while clear correlations exist between life history traits such as longevity and body mass, there are a number of species that do not follow these general rules and these are particularly interesting for improving our fundamental understanding of the process of longevity and ageing. we sought to test if there were signatures of positive selection in genes associated with telomere maintenance that correlated with incidences of increased longevity and body size in mammals. we found a weak correlation between longevity and levels of positive selection and no correlation between the levels of positive selection and body mass. it was not possible for us to pinpoint one single life trait as the main contributor to the strong signature for positive selection in telomere associated genes that we observe across mammals. our results instead are suggestive of a more complex selective force shaping the evolution of these genes that is likely to incorporate variation across species in demography, metabolic rate, germ line generation time, as well as body size and longevity. as telomere-associated genes underpin important functions in maintaining genomic integrity, cancer as a selective force, or more specifically the selective pressure to reduce the incidence of juvenile cancers, could contribute towards these strong signals for protein functional shift that we observe in this gene set thereby providing an alternative to direct selection for increased longevity.

we cannot completely discount any of the current competing hypotheses for increased longevity, nor can we discount the role that other genes outside of telomere maintenance may play in increased longevity. while we have applied rigorous statistical testing to our dataset, ω >  <dig> may not always be a indicator of protein functional shift as it may reflect variations in effective population size  <cit> , recombination events  <cit> , biased gene conversion  <cit>  or relaxation of functional constraint  <cit> . to this end we also examined non-adaptive selective forces on this genes. the proteins in our dataset control very important cellular functions and one might expect to find signals of strong purifying selection, to the contrary we observe high levels of both non-adaptive and adaptive evolutionary events in the data. identifying proteins under species-specific positive selection is biologically significant as it is synonymous with protein functional shift. here we have identified positive selection in a large number of proteins and lineages with significance values set to p-adj <  <dig>  , but of particular interest are the naked mole rat , microbat  and human  lineages all of which manifest increased longevity. it is particularly interesting that there was no overlap in the specific genes identified as having signatures of positive selection in either of the lineage-specific analyses , and these genes were non-overlapping between the naked mole rat, m. lucifugus and human. despite sharing the life history trait of increased longevity, each of these lineages has different strategies for reproduction and survival that can contribute to these different selective regimes, e.g. in the eusocial system adopted by the naked mole rat it is the older females that produce the most offspring  <cit> , the ecological niche of the m. lucifugus and naked mole rat reduce risk of predation  <cit> , and the variation in effective population sizes across all three species results in very different levels of background mutation upon which natural selection can act.

as well as increased longevity, m. lucifugus and naked mole rat have evolved the ability to postpone senescence. we have identified signatures of positive selection acting within regions of the genes directly involved in telomere maintenance in m. lucifugus  and within the fanconi anaemia/brca pathway dna repair pathway in naked mole rat. these signatures of adaptation could be the result of selective pressure for delayed onset of deleterious attributes of ageing. the human lineage represents a unique situation where there is an observed increased longevity but there is no postponement of the ageing process. the identification of two genes  under positive selection in the human lineage spurred us to examine modern human populations for signatures of ongoing adaptive evolution in these proteins. the observed pattern of segregation in the wrn gene in european and african yoruba populations is suggestive of continued positive selective pressure in modern human populations on telomere maintenance processes. there are of course a number of competing selective pressures acting on human populations , and while pathogen load has been proposed as the most dominant driver of adaptation in the human lineage  <cit> , cancer selection has a distinct possibility as a contributing factor  <cit> . indeed many of the sites identified in this study as positively selected are in close proximity to  cancer.

as positive selection and protein functional shift are strongly correlated, identifying proteins under positive selection in specific lineages lends itself to more accurate molecular modeling of ageing, and cancer across species. furthermore, the identification of specific molecular adaptations in telomere associated proteins in species with increased longevity, i.e. naked mole rat, human and m. lucifugus, provides us with an important fundamental step forward in our understanding of the diverse mechanisms involved in the evolution of increased longevity.
