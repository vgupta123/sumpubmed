BACKGROUND
the amitochondriate protist trichomonas vaginalis is responsible for the number one incidence of sexually transmitted disease  worldwide with ~ <dig> million new cases of vaginitis in the us and  <dig> million cases worldwide  <cit> . there are serious health consequences for women, including adverse pregnancy outcomes, risk for cervical cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and infection by other std agents  <cit> . symptomatic women may experience foul-smelling discharge, severe irritation, and abdominal pain while some men will have a non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial urethritis. trichomonosis is now appreciated to increase the portal of entry and exit for hiv  <cit> , and the disproportionate incidence of this std among american minorities is evidence that this std is a health disparities disease. equally troubling is that unlike other stds like chlamydia, the prevalence of t. vaginalis does not decrease with age  <cit> . offering hope for control of this std is the development of a new point-of-care diagnostic  <cit> . given the significant human morbidity caused by t. vaginalis, there is an urgency towards identifying virulence factors and elucidating the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.

immunoglobulin a  antibodies in external secretions may be important in innate immunity and provide for specific defense against mucosal infections. iga has been shown to be protective against viral, bacterial and parasitic infections  <cit> , and inhibition of adherence and agglutination may be mechanisms for clearance  <cit> . intestinal infection stimulates the mucosal production of secretory iga antibodies shown to block the in vitro adherence of entamoeba histolytica trophozoites to epithelial cells thereby preventing lysis of host cells and damage to tissues  <cit> . in giardia lamblia, iga antibodies act as a first line of defense for immune exclusion of the parasite at the mucosal surface  <cit> . studies performed with mice have shown that protection against chlamydia trachomatis genital infection is attributed to iga. for example, there is a direct correlation between mice cervical iga level and clearance of cervical chlamydial antigen  <cit> . furthermore, iga mab against chlamydial major outer membrane protein confers passive protection in mice  <cit> , and likewise, iga mab protects against murine experimental shigellosis  <cit>  and oral challenge of the invasive salmonella typhimurium  <cit> .

in this report we identify a novel 44-kda  surface protein of t. vaginalis that is recognized by an iga mab. the tv <dig> is single copy in the trichomonad genome and is yet another gene found to be down-regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels among iron-depleted organisms  <cit> . remarkably, in contrast to adhesins that are increased in amounts and surface expression upon contact with immortalized vaginal epithelial cells   <cit> , decreased synthesis and amounts of surface tv <dig> follow interaction of parasites with vecs. this makes tv <dig> of t. vaginalis another member of proteins, including adhesins and α-actinin, with at least two independent signaling pathways involving iron and vec adherence  <cit> . lastly, the gene and surface protein were also detected in the bovine trichomonad responsible for fetal wastage, t. foetus, and the oral trichomonad, t. tenax.

RESULTS
iga detects a surface protein of t. vaginalis
the iga mab 6b <dig> reactive with trichomonads in a wc-elisa was used in immunofluorescence experiments. not surprisingly and as can be seen in figure  <dig>  mab 6b <dig> gave a strong intensity of uniform fluorescence over the surface of t. vaginalis organisms . no fluorescence was ever observed with secondary antibody alone, as before,  <cit> . interestingly, mab 6b <dig> also gave uniform surface fluorescence with t. foetus, the bovine trichomonad . a different pattern of surface fluorescence was observed for t. tenax, the oral trichomonad . next, we probed nitrocellulose blots of total proteins after sds-page with mab 6b <dig>  figure 1b shows a single band of identical mobility identified by the iga mab in t. vaginalis , t. foetus  and t. tenax , indicating the presence of a similar-sized immuno-crossreactive protein among the human and bovine trichomonads. as controls, no proteins were detected in nitrocellulose blots of total proteins handled identically but in the absence of mab, as before  <cit> .

isolation of the tv <dig> cdna and sequence homology comparisons of tv44
we next screened a cdna expression library using mab 6b <dig>  three of eight clones encoding recombinant proteins detected by mab 6b <dig> were sequenced, and one clone with an insert size of 1422-bp represented a full-length cdna with an open reading frame  of 1314-bp  encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids. the tv <dig> coding region was pcr amplified for t. vaginalis, t. foetus and t. tenax, and the dna sequences had 100% identity, indicating the complete conservation of the tv <dig> gene among the human and bovine trichomonads . furthermore, we performed a blast search in the ncbi data bank for sequence homology, and figure  <dig> shows the alignment of the complete sequence with  <dig> proteins that gave the highest percent of homology ranging from 13% to 17%. interestingly, these proteins represented transcription initiation factors, albeit the significance of this homology for function of tv <dig> is unknown.

the tv <dig> is a single copy gene
we then performed southern analysis of the gene in the t. vaginalis genome. genomic dna was restricted with ecori and hindiii, which cut outside the gene and psti that digests close to the 3'-end of the gene. blots were probed with a pcr-derived  <dig> -kb radiolabeled fragment representing the coding region. as presented in a representative blot in figure  <dig>  a single hybridizing band in the different restriction digests was obtained for tv <dig>  no additional band was evident for the psti-digested dna, which is likely due to hybridization of the probe with the larger full-length dna gene fragments coupled with a diminished signal from a 3'-end fragment with only a small portion of the gene. this data suggests that tv <dig> is a single copy gene in t. vaginalis genome.

independent down-regulation of tv <dig> in parasites grown in low-iron medium and after contact with immortalized vecs
trichomonads were grown in medium replete with or depleted of iron and compared to organisms cultured in normal medium. rt-pcr was performed on total rna using primers to amplify a 550-bp fragment of the tv <dig> coding region . the amount of the tv <dig> transcript pcr product was decreased in parasites grown in low-iron medium  compared to organisms cultured in normal  or high-iron  medium. as a control, pcr was performed using primers to α-tubulin , and equal amounts of transcript were obtained regardless of the iron status of the parasites, showing equivalent amounts of rna in the reactions. the amounts of tv <dig> detected by mab 6b <dig> in nitrocellulose blots of total proteins from equal number of trichomonads corresponded to the rt-pcr data. as presented in figure 4b, tv <dig> was decreased in amounts in trichomonads grown in low-iron medium  compared to parasites grown in normal  and high-iron  medium, which had equivalent amounts of protein. equal amounts of protein from identical numbers of parasites were electrophoresed and blotted. these data suggest that expression of the tv <dig> gene is regulated by low-iron medium conditions.

we recently demonstrated the up-regulation of parasite genes following adherence of trichomonads to immortalized human vecs  <cit> . therefore, we tested for the expression of tv <dig> following contact of normal grown trichomonads with immortalized ms- <dig> vecs. to our surprise as shown in figure  <dig> and in contrast to adhesins and other genes increased in expression  <cit> , we observed an immediate decreased fluorescence by mab 6b <dig> after adherence  when compared to trichomonads handled identically in the absence of vecs . we then performed combined rt-pcr and immunoblot analysis, and t. vaginalis organisms after contact had decreased amounts of both tv <dig> pcr product  and tv <dig> protein  in contrast to duplicate trichomonads without vecs . amounts of rt-pcr product and protein were decreased 80%  and 53% , respectively, when compared to controls . as a control we showed equal amounts of rna for the rt-pcr reaction by performing rt-pcr with primers specific to α-tubulin . further, equivalent amounts of total proteins for identical number of parasites without and with vecs was evident by equal intensities of duplicate stained gels. as these experiments were done with organisms grown in normal medium, these data reinforce the notion that contact with vecs is an alternative signal to low iron in modulating expression of tv <dig> 

discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first report describing iga mab reactivity to a surface protein of t. vaginalis. other novel features of this protein are as follows: first, tv <dig> is identical to a protein in t. tenax, the oral trichomonad of humans, and in t. foetus, the bovine trichomonad responsible for fetal wastage  <cit> . second, tv <dig> becomes a member of other trichomonad protein families down-regulated in expression by low-iron, such as the adhesins  <cit> . third, expression of tv <dig> is down-regulated independently by either growth of organisms in a low-iron environment or by trichomonads grown in normal medium after contact with host vecs. in this respect, the tv <dig> gene and tv <dig> represent members of other genes and proteins, like adhesins and α-actinin, with distinct regulatory networks involving iron and adherence  <cit> . therefore, it is now evident that multiple signaling pathways are functional for distinct surface proteins of t. vaginalis. it is likely that structure-function characterization of tv <dig> will help determine the significance of these two distinct regulatory pathways for this surface protein. nonetheless, this finding makes clear that t. vaginalis responds during infection both to environmental cues like iron and to adherence to the vaginal epithelium by up- and down-regulating expression of genes  <cit> , a theme that has been consistent for this mucosal pathogen.

with regard to function, the low percent homology of tv <dig> with higher eukaryotic transcription initiation factors  may not be significant, and it would be unreasonable at this time to hypothesize such a function for tv <dig>  nonetheless, these are the only known proteins in the ncbi data bank to which any homology was observed. given the surface localization and the fact that tv <dig> is not detected in purified nuclear extracts by immunoblot analysis , it seems unlikely that this protein functions in transcription regulation. however, the complex regulatory pathways for gene expression of tv <dig> are consistent with those of other known virulence factors of t. vaginalis  <cit> , and therefore, a role for this protein in virulence and pathogenesis cannot be discounted. the down-regulation in transcription and surface expression upon contact with vecs may be indicating a role for tv <dig> for maintenance of morphologic integrity in an ellipsoid form for non-adherent, free-swimming parasites compared to the amoeboid adherent forms  <cit> . alternatively, tv <dig> may interfere with efficient cytoadherence thereby necessitating immediate removal of the protein from the surface upon contact, essentially involving surface remodeling by t. vaginalis. it is not inconceivable that a similar function may exist for the opportunistic t. tenax and the pathogenic bovine trichomonad. indeed, neisseria meningitidis has extensive surface remodeling  <cit> , and candida albicans undergoes both up- and down-regulation of surface proteins after host cell contact  <cit> . future work will be required to fully understand the function of this contact-modulating protein in the host-trichomonad interrelationship.

the biological protective role of iga in recognition of surface protein immunogens in trichomonosis is poorly understood. the iga immunoglobulin has been associated with resistance to a number of mucosal pathogens  <cit> . a positive correlation has been established in e. histolytica between the presence of iga antibodies and the lower incidence of amoebiasis among breast-fed children and individuals from endemic areas  <cit> . there also appears to be protection through inhibiting trophozoite adherence, a blocking ability of human iga antibodies  <cit> . a mucosal iga anti-lectin antibody response was also associated with immune protection against e. histolytica colonization  <cit> . it is significant that iga mab has been shown to be protective for c. trachomatis in rodent studies  <cit> , and likewise, iga mab protects against murine experimental shigellosis  <cit>  and oral challenge of the invasive s. typhimurium  <cit> . moreover, iga-deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to mycobacteria infections  <cit> . it is noteworthy that no inhibition of adherence was evident when trichomonads pretreated with the mab at concentrations known to give intense fluorescence  were added to vecs . this apparent absence of a role for this surface protein in adherence was not surprising given that a ligand assay to identify adhesins  <cit>  did not show tv <dig> bound to vecs . furthermore, that contact with vecs results in disappearance of the surface tv <dig>  suggests only a temporal role, if any, for tv <dig> in any adherence event. of interest is whether this iga mab can be evaluated in animal protection studies  <cit> . indeed, these types of experiments may provide clues as to the importance of this protein to the biology of these parasites and the conservation of identical tv <dig> proteins in different human species and in the bovine trichomonads. therefore, it is important that the nature of antibody responses in patients insofar as protection by iga through recognition of specific surface proteins of t. vaginalis be better characterized in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper describes the identification and characterization of a novel t. vaginalis iga-reactive surface protein called tv <dig>  among the unique features of this single copy gene is identity to a gene in the human oral trichomonad, t. tenax, and in the bovine trichomonad, t. foetus. the tv <dig> gene is another in this parasite regulated in expression by two independent signaling mechanisms involving iron and contact with host cells. this makes tv <dig> a member of a growing number of t. vaginalis proteins with complex regulatory networks.
