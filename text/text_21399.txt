BACKGROUND
drought continues to be one of the most significant environmental stresses as a result of continuous decrease in soil moisture content and increase in global temperature  <cit> . rapid expansion of water-stressed areas necessitates improvement of crops with traits such as drought tolerance and adaptation, through conventional breeding and/or genetic manipulation. for cultivated crops like chickpea, where improvement through conventional breeding is difficult because of a narrow genetic base, comparative gene expression profiling is an alternate way to identify pathways and genes regulating the stress response  <cit> . plants induce expression of a number of genes in response to water limitation. the early response at the cellular level results partly from cell damage, and corresponds partly to adaptive processes that initiate changes in the metabolism and structure of the cell that allows it to function under low water potential  <cit> . a wide range of techniques and strategies are being deployed these days to identify genes involved in stress responses  <cit> . but, while the advent of microarrays and protein profiling has generated a lot of information on gene expression during stress response, conventional gene-by-gene analysis is needed to validate these claims.

most of the data on gene expression in plants in response to drought and other abiotic stresses has been generated using arabidopsis  <cit> . however, in view of the wide genetic diversity that exists in the plant kingdom, this data may not hold true for other species. therefore, individual crop-types should be studied to understand crop-specific responses to a particular stress. among crop plants, cereals are the most studied with respect to gene expression because of their economic value and ample resources for research  <cit> . for example, a comparative gene expression study between a salt-tolerant and a salt-sensitive rice cultivar has shown that expression of genes related to protein synthesis and turnover were delayed in the sensitive variety and were perhaps responsible for the differential response  <cit> . however, a recent report suggested that salt-tolerance was due to the constitutive expression of some stress responsive genes that in the sensitive variety were inducible  <cit> . transcriptional profiling of developing maize kernels in response to water deficit indicated that two classes of stress-responsive genes exist; one being specific to concurrent application of stress and another remains affected after transient stress  <cit> . a previous study from our group also indicated that the dehydration-induced expression of some genes in chickpea remain unaffected even after removal of dehydration stress and may lead to adaptation  <cit> . all these data point towards a hypothesis that a plant that is well adapted to stress has two basic mechanisms of stress-tolerance; constitutive expression of genes required for adaptation and quick expression of genes required to repair cellular damage and physiological reprogramming in adverse conditions. comparative gene expression studies using cultivars with contrasting stress-tolerance features has become a useful tool to identify these two classes of genes.

in this study chickpea , a popular food legume crop was used for analysis of gene expression under drought stress. although chickpea is generally grown in relatively less irrigated lands and some cultivars adapt well to the water-limited environment  <cit> , drought poses a serious threat to chickpea production causing 40-50% reduction of its yield potential  <cit> . lack of adequate genetic and genomic resources impede progress of crop improvement in chickpea. in one study, a pulse microarray, containing about  <dig> cdnas from chickpea, grass-pea and lentil, was used for the analysis of gene expression in response to water limitation, cold temperatures, and high salinity, in chickpea cultivars with contrasting stress-tolerance features  <cit> . similarly, a database was generated from an est library constructed by subtractive suppressive hybridization  of root tissue of two chickpea cultivars  <cit> . comparative proteome maps of chickpea nucleus and cell wall also revealed differentially expressed proteins during water-deficit stress  <cit> . an exhaustive study on rapid dehydration-induced  <dig> bp supersage tags that were generated from root est libraries of untreated and  <dig> h rapid dehydration-treated chickpea seedling has been reported. in addition, over  <dig> unitags having more than  <dig>  fold abundance were identified in the dehydration libraries. microarray analysis of  <dig> of them exhibited about 80% congruency with the supersage data  <cit> .

we have previously reported  <dig> ests of chickpea that were up-regulated more than  <dig> fold in response to rapid dehydration as compared to control conditions in the laboratory  <cit> . however, drought conditions in the field are quite different. furthermore, transcriptional activation of a particular gene by drought might not be directly related to drought tolerance. in this study, the gene expression of a relatively drought-tolerant and a drought-sensitive chickpea cultivar were compared in response to progressive depletion of water. we have constructed ssh libraries from whole seedlings of the two cultivars at different stages of water depletion. a number of genes that express constitutively, as well as many that were induced quickly after application of stress in the tolerant cultivar, were identified. annotation by homology search indicated that these genes are involved in cellular organization, protein metabolism, signal transduction and transcription.

RESULTS
differential drought tolerance in two chickpea cultivars
a comparison of drought tolerance between two cultivated chickpea varieties  was conducted to establish their contrasting characters. the changes in leaf relative water content , chlorophyll content, abscisic acid  and proline were measured in seedlings grown for  <dig> d after germination before stopping irrigation  for different time points. rwc is a measure of stress-adaptation and accounts for osmotic adjustment, which is considered to be one of the most important mechanisms for adaptation to water-limited environment in plants. during the treatment both cultivars showed a little increase in rwc after  <dig> d . this could either be due to increased transport of water from other compartments of the plant to the leaf in order to maintain turgor, or may have resulted from an osmotic adjustment due to increased synthesis of osmolytes. after this initial increase, leaf rwc of both the cultivars showed steep decrease up to the end of treatment . however, pusabgd <dig> registered about 10% higher rwc than iccv <dig> at the end-point . although the role of proline in stress tolerance is debatable, its accumulation is considered to be one of the indicators of adaptive response  <cit> . both the cultivars showed greater proline content within  <dig> d of treatment and maintained the increase up to  <dig> d. however, proline accumulation in pusabgd <dig> was more than two fold higher than in iccv <dig> . chlorophyll content is considered to be the measure of rate of photosynthesis. this started decreasing with the initiation of dh in both the cultivars, but better maintenance in the rate of photosynthesis was displayed by pusabgd <dig> throughout the course of stress treatment . aba acts as a key regulator of the dehydration response  <cit> . most of the dehydration-inducible genes respond to treatment with exogenous aba  <cit> . the course of aba accumulation in both cultivars followed the same pattern, with pusabgd <dig> showing constitutively higher aba content than iccv <dig>  there was a sharp increase in the accumulation of aba within  <dig> d indicating its involvement in early response to stress, whereas in the later period of treatment, aba content was re-adjusted and maintained. overall, aba accumulation in pusabgd <dig> throughout the treatment was  <dig> fold higher than in iccv <dig> . taken together pusabgd <dig> displayed a better tolerance to drought stress than iccv <dig> with respect to the above assays.

cloning and sequencing of chickpea ests differentially expressed during drought stress
plants perceive and respond to stress. upon perception of stress, a signal is communicated to downstream components resulting in change of gene expression and thereby of proteins required for the initial damage-repair and physiological re-programming for better adaptation. since physiological parameters studied under drought stress conditions indicated that pusabgd <dig> was more drought-tolerant compared to iccv <dig>  we intended to identify the transcripts that were more abundant in the former. we used subtractive cdna suppression hybridization  technology to clone these transcripts. ssh is widely used to screen differentially expressed genes because of its high efficiency in enriching low expressing genes and normalization of targeted fragments, four subtracted cdna libraries were constructed with poly  rna as described in methods .  <dig> randomly selected clones from all the libraries were single-pass sequenced and  <dig> high-quality unique ests were generated, which were deposited to genbank. these were analyzed for putative functional classification by similarity search in the current genbank database using the blastx algorithm. of these,  <dig> ests showed significant similarity to known sequences, while the remaining  <dig> ests were deemed novel . further,  <dig> could be functionally categorized according to their blastx match and the remaining  <dig> ests of unknown function along with the  <dig> novel ests were kept under 'unclassified' category. the  <dig> functionally categorized ests represented genes involved in metabolism , cellular organization , protein metabolism   and signal transduction  cell defense , cell transport , energy metabolism , hormone biosynthesis , and transcription . the 'unclassified' est clones  accounted for 12% . a number of ests representing known stress-responsive proteins were present in abundance in the libraries, indicating their high expression in drought stressed seedlings. among the most notable are the genes encoding β-amylase , mips , albumin , polygalacturonase inhibiting protein , 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase , chaperons , dehydrins , proteases , translation factors  and transporters .

comparative transcript profile of pusabgd <dig> with respect to iccv2
the expression of  <dig> unique ests obtained from the ssh libraries was analyzed by reverse-northern experiment as described previously  <cit> . pcr amplified ests were spotted in duplicate on nylon membranes in a 96-spot format. chickpea actin gene was spotted as a control for normalization and the kanamycin resistance gene, nptii was used as the negative control for background subtraction. radio-labeled first strand cdna probes prepared using poly  rna isolated from control/stressed samples of pusabgd <dig> or iccv <dig> were used for hybridization and ests expressed differentially in the two cultivars were identified by the obtained differential hybridization intensities. expression of each clone was tested in at least three independent drought stress experiments to confirm reproducibility. expression ratio was calculated following the methods described in previous studies  <cit> . signal intensity of each spot was normalized by subtracting the intensity of the negative control . fold expression was presented as the expression ratio  of pusabgd <dig> to iccv <dig> relative to the ratio of intensity of actin. genes showing ≥  <dig> fold higher expression in pusabgd <dig> at any time point in comparison to iccv <dig> were considered as differentially expressed and studied further. approximately 23%,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the ests showed more than two-fold abundance in pusabgd <dig> at control,  <dig> d,  <dig> d and  <dig> d dh conditions respectively. relatively higher number of ests expressed differentially during dh treatment in pusabgd <dig>   <dig> % of all the ests showed ≥  <dig> fold higher abundance in pusabgd <dig> relative to that in iccv <dig> at all the time points. ests expressing more in pusabgd <dig> in comparison to iccv <dig> at control condition naturally include drought-responsive and non-responsive genes.

to achieve a comprehensive overview of relative expression profiles,  <dig> ests were clustered according to their relative expression patterns in pusabgd <dig> in comparison to iccv <dig> by the hierarchical clustering method using the correlation coefficient of average linkage of the log-transformed ratio  <cit> . sota clustering classified all the ests into  <dig> groups according to the distance of correlation . the data was taken in terms of fold expression of ests at control or dh stress in pusabgd <dig> relative to that in iccv <dig>  the data sets were log-transformed to the base  <dig> to normalize the scale of expression and to reduce the noise. the clusters with n> <dig> were used to study the co-expression patterns of the genes. detailed information on ests within each cluster is presented in additional file  <dig> and  <dig>  the ests belonging to cluster  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> particularly were never found to be expressed less in pusabgd <dig> as compared to iccv <dig>  ests of cluster  <dig> showed equivalent expressions in both the cultivars at control condition, however, expressed relatively higher in pusabgd <dig> during dh treatment. apart from the ests in the unclassified group, these ests are mainly involved in cellular organization, metabolism and protein translation category. cluster  <dig> ests exhibited higher expression in pusabgd <dig> at all the time points during the dh treatment. genes related to cellular organization, metabolism and signal transduction mostly constitute this cluster. seven transcription-related and eighteen protein metabolism-related ests are also included in this cluster that comprises nearly 36% of the total ests. cluster  <dig> genes represented those that had higher expression in pusabgd <dig> only at  <dig> d and at  <dig> d dh conditions, but were similar to iccv <dig> at the later phase of stress. important genes to mention in this cluster are several defense related genes such as polygalactouronase inhibitor proteins, mrp like abc transporter and genes involved in sugar metabolism and photosynthesis. interestingly, these three clusters included a lot of genes that showed homology with those encoding ribosomal proteins and translation elongation. this is in keeping with a previous study that also reported an early expression of genes involved in protein synthesis in a salt-tolerant rice variety in response to salt stress  <cit> . genes involved in signal transduction showed a simple pattern of relative expression. most of them, present in cluster  <dig>  showed a steady higher abundance in pusabgd <dig> at all time points. interestingly, three ests representing a cbl-interacting protein kinase, a receptor-like kinase and a phosphoglycerate kinase showed higher relative expression in pusabgd <dig> only at  <dig> d dh . most of the ests that were more abundant in pusabgd <dig> represented functions for cellular organization and metabolism. they displayed complex relative expression patterns probably because they were involved in different pathways. the ests that belong to the unclassified group showed no distinct clustering patterns, which may be due to their heterologous composition. comparative transcriptome profiling suggested that pusabgd <dig> possesses a different gene expression pattern from iccv <dig> under drought stress.

it is already mentioned that about 23% of the ests  showed ≥  <dig> fold higher abundance in pusabgd <dig> relative to that in iccv <dig> at unstressed condition. comparative transcript profiling revealed that 84%  of these ests expressed more during the course of dh stress in pusabgd <dig> in comparison to iccv <dig>  this result indicated that expression of most of the ests in this category is regulated by dh stress.

monitoring expression profiles of selected high expressing genes
more stringent criteria were applied to shortlist the genes that were showing drastic expression differences in the two cultivars. the genes showing ≥  <dig> fold higher relative expression at the unstressed condition and ≥  <dig> fold higher relative expression at any point of dh stress treatment in pusabgd <dig> in comparison to iccv <dig> were considered. this stringent parameter screened  <dig> genes  from the  <dig> described above. eight of these belonged to signal transduction category e.g. cbl-interacting protein kinase  , putative protein kinases , protein phosphatase 2c , g-protein coupled receptor , 14-3- <dig> protein homolog . implication of sos2-like protein kinases  in providing abiotic stress tolerance by activating the membrane-bound transporters is well documented  <cit> . protein phosphatase 2c was shown to interact with sos <dig> and mediate aba-responsive signals  <cit> . seven genes of transcription factor category mostly represented ap2-domain containing proteins. members of the ap2/erebp family of transcription factors, especially those that recognize drought-responsive element  in target promoters mediate distinct responses to abiotic stresses such as drought, salt and cold  <cit> . another gene in this group putatively encoded a α-nac transcription factor. nac belongs to a family of proteins specific to plants and are found to play a role in a diverse set of developmental processes including formation and maintenance of shoot apical meristem and floral morphogenesis  <cit> . overexpression of a nac transcription factor in arabidopsis up-regulated several stress-responsive genes in the transgenic plants, and thereby conferred drought tolerance  <cit> . zinc finger proteins  are ubiquitous; some of them were shown to provide tolerance against abiotic stresses  <cit> . six ests represented well-known stress responsive genes encoding aba-responsive protein , stress activated protein , salt tolerance proteins , dehydration-induced protein . high expression of ten genes under cellular organization category was well understood as they putatively encoded leas and dehydrins. higher accumulation of dehydrin mrna transcript in drought tolerant sunflower was associated with cellular turgor maintenance under drought stress  <cit> . dehydrin, lea and proline rich proteins are thought to provide stability to other proteins in osmotic stress  <cit> . high relative expression of six genes related to protein metabolism corroborates the results of a previous study with rice cultivars  <cit> .

overexpression of superoxide dismutase has been implicated in free radical detoxification and suggested to have a major role in defending the mangrove species against severe abiotic stresses  <cit> . four ests were identified on the basis of early expression upon dh treatment in pusabgd <dig>  one of them was a cbl-interacting protein kinase , two represented ribosomal proteins  and one was a leucine rich repeat protein  . absolute expression of all these  <dig> ests in the two contrasting cultivars was compared and presented in figure  <dig>  these  <dig> ests can be clustered in four groups according to their expression in the tolerant cultivar pusabgd <dig> .  <dig> out of  <dig> high expressing ests belonged to clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  the mean curves of these two clusters registered a steady increase in gene expression from unstressed condition to the end of dh stress treatment, although, there was a basic difference between these two clusters. average expression intensity of the cluster  <dig> genes was much higher than that of the cluster  <dig> genes and there was uniformity in the expression of the cluster  <dig> genes. two ests  of the cluster  <dig> displayed a rapid induction at  <dig> d dh; but their expression went down bellow their basal expression level at  <dig> d dh time point, however, upregulated again at  <dig> d. their expression was checked in three different biological samples in triplicates by qreal time-pcr to avoid any error . one of these two ests encoded pr- <dig> protein. although, the pr proteins are implicated in cellular defense as they express under pathogen attack abiotic stresses like drought and salinity also induce their expression. stable expression of a pea pr- <dig> in brassica enhanced its germination and growth in presence of sodium chloride  <cit> . the other est coded for a nac transcription factor. interestingly, most of the ests belonging to signal transduction category exhibited a steady increase in expression under dh stress condition from their basal level. only two of them, one encoding a protein phosphatase 2c  and the other, cbl-interacting protein kinase  showed sudden high expression at  <dig> d dh and then reduced at  <dig> d dh. naf domains of cipks were shown to interact with phosphatase 2c   <cit> . similar expression pattern of these ests correlates with their mutual interaction. except nac, the other ests encoding transcription factors in this cluster expressed steadily higher than their basal level. five genes of cluster  <dig> that showed sudden high expression at  <dig> d dh condition mostly represent proteins of unknown function. another est of this cluster encoded a putative rna binding protein and suddenly expressed  <dig> fold high at  <dig> d dh in pusabgd <dig>  expression of this est in iccv <dig> also followed a similar pattern, but with a much lower absolute value . role of a specific glycine-rich rna binding protein in regulation of stomata and thereby in abiotic stress response is already reported  <cit> . the cluster  <dig> genes, that showed a rapid high fold of expression at  <dig> d dh and maintained that up to  <dig> d dh belong to protein metabolism category. three of them were related to protein synthesis , and exhibited 15-fold high expression early in the dh treatment. another represented a factor involved in protein degradation and expressed about  <dig> fold higher than its basal expression level at  <dig> d dh. fold expression of these genes in the sensitive cultivar iccv <dig> at the same time point was comparatively much lower. interestingly, two ests representing elongation factor  <dig> alpha  and ribosomal protein l18a  also showed early induction in iccv <dig>  but their absolute levels of expression were much lower than that in pusabgd <dig> . to validate the results obtained by reverse northern analysis, rna accumulation of ten ests  was monitored in both the cultivars by northern analysis . overall, the result of northern blot analysis was in agreement with the expression data obtained by reverse-northern analysis.

we recently reported the functional validation of two chickpea genes corresponding to two differentially expressed ests described in this study; one  codes for a cbl-interacting proteins kinase  and another  for a zinc finger protein . expression of cacipk <dig> in tobacco and arabidopsis conferred improved tolerance against high concentration of sodium chloride and mannitol  <cit> . ectopic expression of cazf improved germination efficiency of transgenic tobacco in presence of high salinity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to date, a limited number of studies on drought stress-mediated gene expression in chickpea have been reported. in this study we described an analysis of gene expression in chickpea in response to drought stress and intended to carry out a comparative transcript profiling between the contrasting chickpea varieties. we focused on a set of transcripts that exhibited higher abundance in a drought-tolerant cultivar in comparison to a drought-sensitive one. we took suppressive subtractive hybridization  approach to construct the est libraries because chickpea est resources are limited. we applied water-deficit stress by withdrawal of irrigation for three different periods. this allowed us to perform a series of comparison of transcript abundance between and within the chickpea varieties at different time points of stress treatment. comparative expression profiles categorized the ests in  <dig> clusters according to their relative expression patterns.  <dig> ests were identified on the basis of their very high fold of relative expression in the tolerant variety. high fold of abundance of these transcripts in the tolerant variety might be just correlative and establishment of any relation between this transcript abundance and drought-tolerance in chickpea is beyond the scope of the experiments performed in this study. we also do not intend to comment that the mechanism of drought-tolerance in chickpea is limited to only transcriptional upregulation of some genes. the purpose of this study was to compare two contrasting chickpea varieties and to generate a resource to initiate gene-by-gene analysis for drought-tolerance mechanism.

the differential expression pattern of the transcripts observed might be applicable only to these two particular chickpea varieties used in this study, although the genes identified on the basis of differential expression patterns corroborate with results from some of the similar studies on other plants  <cit> . in this study, a stress condition close to field drought was applied. field drought is a slow process and the plants go through an adaptive process in contrast to the drastic condition of rapid dehydration. furthermore, due to narrow genetic diversity among the cultivated legume varieties the genes that express co-incidentally due to dh stress may be common in both the varieties and, therefore, might not have been highlighted in a comparative gene expression analysis. these might be the reasons for less number of differentially expressed transcripts detected in our study in comparison to that in the sage analysis  <cit> .

temperate grain legumes such as pea, fava bean and lentil share similar gene arrangement with chickpea  <cit> . it is, therefore, expected that this data will benefit the study of the similar grain legume crops. since the genes that experience subtle changes in expression in dh stress might not have been detected due to the stringent method of construction of ssh cdna library, much robust experimentation involving oligonucleotide-based microarrays supported by enough est resources is required for clear understanding.
