BACKGROUND
the species brassica rapa  includes several subspecies providing human nutrition in the form of leafy, root and stem vegetables and edible oil. it also represents the origin of the brassica 'a’ genome and contributes to other cultivated oilseed crops of brassica allopolyploids: b. napus  and b. juncea   <cit> . therefore, b. rapa has great potential as a model for genomic and evolutionary research in brassica species. over the past decade, a growing number of genomic resources for b. rapa have become available  <cit> , in particular the whole genome sequence of b. rapa accession chiifu-401- <dig>  an inbred chinese cabbage line, which was published in late  <dig>  <cit> .

with the availability of the b. rapa genome sequence  <cit> , it is essential to further identify and determine the activity of all functional elements on a genome-wide scale. for this purpose, a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome is required to reveal potentially transcribed regions and understand expression patterns of the entire b. rapa gene model sets across tissues. high-throughput rna-seq technology represents a powerful and cost-efficient tool for transcription profiling  <cit> . first, it can detect and quantify gene expression with digital measurements, and is especially sensitive for low-expressed genes  <cit> . second, it allows researchers to improve gene annotation by extending transcriptional boundaries of genes and permits the discovery of novel genes or transcripts  <cit> . third, the most attractive advantage is that rna-seq can survey alternative splicing  events at single nucleotide resolution  <cit> . in addition, rna-seq data show a high level of reproducibility in both technical and biological replicates  <cit> .

in this study, we generated rna-seq data from six different tissues  of the b. rapa accession chiifu-401- <dig>  which was the reference line used for whole genome sequencing  <cit> . by performing a comprehensive analysis of these rna-seq data from various tissues, our goals were:  to identify actively transcribed regions in the b. rapa genome, including annotated coding sequences and novel transcribed regions ;  to unveil the transcriptome dynamics of b. rapa gene models, and identify candidate genes that are conserved, specific, or show correlated expression across tissues; and  study the as of b. rapa genes and investigate whether 'as-preferred’ genes are enriched in certain functional categories or are associated with particular gene structure, such as short introns.

RESULTS
generation, mapping, and assessment of rna-seq reads
paired-end rna-seq reads of  <dig> bp in length were generated from six major organs or tissues of b. rapa including root , stem, leaf , flower, silique and callus. the base quality of rna-seq reads was checked and analyzed using fastqc  . we used relatively stringent criteria for quality control by removing the pair-end reads containing ns or those where the number of bases whose phred-like score was less than  <dig> exceeded 10% . for eliminating the errors from the mis-priming of primers in rna-seq experiments, the first nine base pairs of reads were trimmed before read alignment. using the software tophat <dig>  <cit>  and allowing an at most 2-bp mismatch, we obtained over  <dig> million uniquely mapped reads for subsequent analyses . seventy-four percent of uniquely mapped reads were contiguously mapped back to the b. rapa v <dig>  genome sequences, and the others were splice-mapped to, and spanned potential splice junctions of the genome . the uniquely mapped reads covered over  <dig> million bases of the total genomic bases, with an average read-depth of 26– <dig> per base across different samples . around 81% of uniquely mapped reads confirmed the expression of ~ <dig> mb out of a total of  <dig> mb of annotated b. rapa coding sequence . the remaining ~16% and ~3% of uniquely mapped reads were aligned to another ~ <dig> million genomic bases in intergenic and intronic regions, respectively , implying that large amounts of actively transcribed regions remain unidentified in the b. rapa genome. the average read depth of coverage in cds, introns and intergenic regions are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  as expected, the read depth in intergenic regions and introns was lower than that in exons, which correlated with the subsequent observation in this study that novel transcripts discovered from these regions are commonly expressed at low levels. the read depth seemed to be distributed relatively evenly along the whole body of genes , reflecting no introduction of obvious bias during randomly primed reverse transcription and subsequent rna sequencing. the two samples of root and leaf tissues from different individual plants both showed a high degree of concordance in gene expression of log2-transformed fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped  values .

rna-seq data improved the annotation of the b. rapa genome
the transcribed regions/units were constructed independently in individual tissues and then merged into a final dataset containing  <dig>  transcripts .  <dig>  transcripts from this dataset completely  or partially  overlapped with  <dig>  annotated gene models in b. rapa, and the remaining transcripts results in the identification of  <dig>  novel transcribed regions  in the b. rapa genome .

the b. rapa gene models  were annotated only using open reading frames , and thus the 5′ and 3′ boundaries of untranslated regions  have not been defined. here, through globally comparing length-complete transcripts with corresponding b. rapa gene models, we defined the 5′-boundary regions of  <dig>  transcribed genes and the 3′-boundary regions of  <dig>  transcribed genes . the median 5′- and 3′-utr lengths determined by the rna-seq data were  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively . the estimated length of 5′-utrs in b. rapa is longer than that in the closely related model species, arabidopsis thaliana ; however, their 3′-utrs are similar   <cit> .

gene ontology  categories with significantly longer or shorter utrs were obtained by comparing the lengths of all utrs of each go category with total utr length . the transcripts/genes related to regulatory signals and binding domains seem to have long 5′ and 3′-utrs, as exemplified in the transcripts/genes encoding protein kinases, membrane proteins, and signal transducers . by contrast, ribosomal genes seem to have short 5′-utrs. this observation is consistent with previous reports in other organisms  <cit> . in addition, we scanned a small upstream orf  of start codons, and found that  <dig>   genes contain a uorf  in the 5′-utr region . the importance and mechanism of uorfs as regulatory factors for gene expression have been revealed clearly in recent years  <cit> ; therefore, further analyses of these novel utrs should greatly aid research towards identifying all known regulatory elements in the b. rapa genome.

discovery of novel transcripts
we identified  <dig>  ntrs that are not linked to any annotated gene models in b. rapa . over  <dig> %  of the ntrs have an orf greater than  <dig> amino acids as predicted by augustus  <cit> , and  <dig> of them contain pfam protein domains  <cit> . additionally,  <dig> ntrs have sequence similarity  to transposable elements  in repbase , reflecting substantial te activity in the b. rapa genome. only ~20% of them are supported by expressed sequence tags  , despite using  <dig>  ests from the national center for biotechnology information  database. to validate the predicted novel transcripts, we randomly selected six of them for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  analysis. all six were confirmed to have transcriptional activity in at least one tissue .

we quantified the expression of the constructed transcripts using fpkm values  <cit> , and then compared the novel transcripts with annotated ones in terms of expression level and tissue breadth of expression. first, the fpkm cumulative distribution revealed that these novel ntrs had much lower transcription levels than known transcripts  . this agreed with another comparison that showed that novel ntrs without est support were expressed at a significantly lower level than those with est support . this feature of low expression level may explain why these novel ntrs have not been annotated before, but were detected effectively by rna-seq technology. second, we found that novel ntrs showed narrow tissue breadth compared with annotated genes, as shown by the t value which scores a value between  <dig> for housekeeping genes and  <dig> for tissue-specific genes  <cit>  . the feature of preferential organ-specific expression may be another reason for these genes not being annotated in the b. rapa genome  <cit> . it should be noted that some tissue-specific ntr may not be real, because we could not collect all diverse tissues or sufficient replicates; however the conclusions were based on the comparison of tissue breadth between ntrs and annotated genes in the same background.

these ntrs were difficult to discover previously because of their low-level and organ-specific expression; however, high-throughput sequencing technology and individual organ libraries permitted their discovery. further analysis showed that highly expressed and poorly expressed novel transcripts were relatively equally detected in silique and callus tissues, unlike in other tissues, where poorly expressed novel transcripts were preferentially discovered . we speculated that because the current b. rapa genomic annotation is mainly based on ests collected from normal tissues, transcripts preferentially expressed in these two relatively specialized tissues could have remained unannotated. thus, generating rna-seq data from more diverse tissues from different developmental stages or environmental conditions will be helpful for improving the annotation of the b. rapa genomic sequence.

tissue dynamics of b. rapa transcriptomes
the read depth of coverage for each b. rapa genomic location was calculated across all tissues. this information is presented in .wig files, which, together with raw rna-seq data have been submitted to the geo database . transcriptome characteristics including tissue specificity, and conserved or novel transcripts in the genome, can be viewed with implemented integrative genomics viewer  or other visualization tools .

for each gene model, it was considered expressed if lower boundary of the fpkm values for the 95% confidence interval of the abundance of gene was greater than zero .  <dig>  genes  were detected as expressed in at least one tissue, of which  <dig>  genes were constitutively expressed in all tissues . the clustering of log2-transformed fpkm values of constitutively expressed genes shows the transcriptomic relationship between tissues as a dendrogram: , root), ), callus) .

we obtained a dataset containing  <dig> highly and stably expressed genes representing tissue-conserved expressed genes whose fpkm values are greater than  <dig> in every tissue . this dataset contains potential useful housekeeping genes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, actin, ubiquitin, tubulin and elongation factor 1-a, ribosomal protein, calmodulin, glutathione peroxidase and g-box regulating factor. for tissue-specific expressed genes, we observed some significantly meaningful gene groups in flower and silique tissues . many genes encoding lipid transfer proteins, oleosin, glycosyl hydrolase, lipase and transferases involved in protein amino acid glycosylation and phosphorylation, biosynthesis of flavonoids, biosynthesis of long chain fatty acids, and cellulose biosynthetic process were specifically expressed and functional in siliques. with respect to flower-specific gene expression, rapid alkalinization factor, pectate lyase, pollen ole e  <dig> allergen and extensin family protein, pectinesterase family protein, arabinogalactan-protein involved pollen tube growth, invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor, pectate lyase, and s <dig> self-incompatibility protein-related were identified.

to identify highly correlated groups of genes , we conducted weighted gene correlation network analysis using the r-package  <cit> . after inspection of functional annotation of genes  in each module, we identified some meaningful co-expressed genes . first, four modules  abundant in ribosomal genes  were highly expressed across all tissues. second, one module  is nearly exclusively committed to photosynthesis, with predominant expression of genes in leaf tissue encoding photosystem i and ii subunit proteins, chlorophyll i and ii binding proteins, rubisco subunit and activase, and other genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, the photosynthetic electron transport chain, carbon utilization by fixation of carbon dioxide and light harvesting. we noticed that a similar group of co-expressed genes was reported in the maize leaf developmental transcriptome  <cit> , implying that indispensable co-expression of these genes is required for leaf photosynthesis. third, three modules  were significantly enriched for protein kinases and transcription factors  , which were highly expressed in flowers.

identification of splice junctions and alternative splicing  events
a total of  <dig>  unique splice junctions  were detected using tophat  <cit>  ;  <dig>   of them confirmed  <dig> % of all known  <dig>  exon-exon junctions in the b. rapa genome. examination of the dinucleotides at the splicing borders showed that  <dig> % of them had gt-ag splicing junctions .

these predicted junctions allowed us to further define four main types of as events as intron retention , exon skipping , alternative 5′ splice site donor , and alternative 3′ splice site acceptor  in each tissue  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  as events in all tissues, representing the four known types of as, were identified in  <dig>  genes . only  <dig>  of the  <dig>  expressed genes contained two or more exons; therefore, it was estimated that about  <dig> %  of the intron-containing genes are alternatively spliced. we also found that about  <dig> % of them underwent multiple as events, producing a variety of transcripts from a single gene , illustrating the high complexity of the transcriptome.

similar proportions of as genes have been observed in rice  and maize ; however, the proportion detected in b. rapa was lower than that in a. thaliana   <cit> . this difference in the distribution of as genes may be explained by higher numbers of est/rna-seq that are available for the model species a. thaliana. we believe that the figures presented here represent an underestimate and more as events in b. rapa remain to be revealed, because as is estimated to occur in 95% of intron-containing genes in humans  <cit> . in addition, we observed that ir is the most common event and the use of alternative 3′ splice sites is more than two-fold more frequent than the use of alternative 5′ splice sites. this pattern, particularly the abundance of ir, is conserved in diverse plants such as medicago truncatula, populus trichocarpa, a. thaliana, oryza sativa, chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and brachypodium distachyon <cit> . the prevalence of ir in b. rapa and other plants supports an intron-definition mechanism for pre-messenger rna splicing  <cit> . we found that the average size of retained introns was significantly shorter than that of introns in general in b. rapa . this observation in b. rapa further supports the hypothesis that plants always have small introns compared with animals, which have large introns and therefore use an exon-definition mechanism, resulting in higher rates of es  <cit> .

we further investigated the tissue distribution of predicted splice junctions . we divided all  <dig>  read-supported splice junctions into two classes: the  <dig>  known or annotated genomic exon-exon splice junctions and the remaining  <dig>  novel splice junctions. it could be assumed that the former represent the junctions used for normal transcription, whereas the latter  always reflect the existence of as and produce novel splice variants of transcripts  <cit> . we observed that each tissue dataset contributed between 50% and 78% of the read-supported known exon-exon splice junctions and the majority  of them was detected to be shared by more than two tissues. this represents the normal and most frequent use of constitutive transcripts or isoforms in different tissues. for novel splice junctions,  <dig> % of them were shared by more than two tissues and the remaining were detected in only one tissue representing tissue-specific or tissue-restricted splice variants . it may be that as events appear to be tissue-specific because they are rare, and more samples and replicates must been included to confirm the estimation for the tissue-specific splice junctions. however, a larger proportion of novel splice junctions are commonly detected in multiple tissues, indicating the prevalence of as across tissues in the b. rapa genome.

'as-preferred’ genes
analysis of go enrichment for as genes, using all b. rapa genes as the background, revealed that go categories enriched with as genes were associated with signal transduction, regulation, response, binding and catalytic activity . it is worth noting that a go category  and its paternal go categories were significantly abundant in as genes. ras/small gtpases generally play a role in signal transduction as molecular switches for a variety of cellular signaling events  <cit> , and as may be essential for these genes to function in regulation and signal transduction.

considering the possible as effect on 'regulation’-related genes, we conducted a systematic survey of as events that occurred in genes encoding tfs. first, based on annotated tf genes in a. thaliana , we identified  <dig>  b. rapa genes and classified them into  <dig> different tf families through homology searching and domain identification . second, about 89% of tf genes showed expression in at least one tissue and  <dig> % of those underwent as. subsequently, we examined the ratio of as genes in each tf subfamily, and identified  <dig> tf subfamilies, such as arf, ap <dig>  mikc, c3h and myb-related, that have higher as frequencies than others . we found that previously reported as events in tf genes, such as in cca1/lhy-like myb  <cit> , r2r3-type myb  <cit> , mikc-type mads  <cit> , bzip  <cit> , and nac  <cit> , almost all belong to these 'as-preferred’ tf subfamilies. as suggested in metazoan  <cit> , the above observation shows that alternative splicing may serve as an important and prevalent mechanism for these tf-encoding genes to form protein complexes that function in transcription in b. rapa.

intriguingly, these 'as-preferred’ genes were also those that were more likely to have been retained in mesopolyploid b. rapa during the diploidization process following a recent whole genome triplication that occurred in a brassica ancestor ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit> . in other angiosperms tfs and signal transducer genes are preferentially retained as duplicates after whole genome duplication  events  <cit> . this was popularly explained by the gene balance hypothesis  <cit> , which suggests that genes participate in the formation of macromolecular complexes, or are involved in more interaction or regulation are dosage sensitive and are thus expected to be retained more often after wgd  <cit> . as is able not only to remove functional domains to produce non-functional transcripts, thus regulating gene dosage  <cit> , but also causes subfunctionalization between wgd-derived paralogous genes  <cit> . thus, the observation that over-retained genes always have a high frequency of as suggested that alternative splicing, as a fundamental aspect of the expression of many genes, may be a form of divergence of duplicated genes and thus contributed to their retention, although the possibility that as and retention may are parallel and independent phenomena driven by a third selective factor, could not be excluded.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the rna-seq data revealed the extent of transcription of the b. rapa genome, and simultaneously improved the existing gene annotation. the identification of numerous novel ntrs, commonly poorly or tissue-specifically expressed, led to the proposal that further transcriptome data from high-throughput platform will unveil previously unidentified functional regions of the b. rapa genome. a complete picture of the transcriptome across the major organs of b. rapa was provided, including candidate tissue-specific, tissue-conserved, or tissue-correlated expressed genes. the comprehensive analysis of as and splice junctions increased our understanding of the complexity of the b. rapa transcriptome.
