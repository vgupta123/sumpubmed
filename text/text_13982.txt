BACKGROUND
angiogenin  is a  <dig> kda protein that belongs to the pancreatic ribonuclease a  superfamily  <cit> , and is involved in angiogenesis by inducing the formation of blood vessels  <cit> . ang is over-expressed in tumoral cancer cells  <cit>  and inhibition of ang function through protein-protein interactions blocks the establishment, progression and metastasis in mice  <cit> . ang may function as a trna-specific ribonuclease that binds to actin on the surface of endothelial cells; once bound, angiogenin is translocated to the nucleus, promoting the endothelial invasiveness necessary for blood vessel formation. the biomedical importance of this protein has been recently pinpointed by studies that have associated point mutations in ang to neuro-degenerative disease as in the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <cit> .

human ang  has been widely studied and has been the first to be isolated from human colon adenocarciroma cells  <cit> . crystallization of the hang protein in  <dig>  <cit>  has been instrumental for many molecular and biomedical studies, however little insight has been achieved regarding the structural and functional constraints on ang mutational dynamics. despite the important function of ang, and therefore its expected evolutionary conservation, many research groups found this protein to be evolutionarily variable, probably linked to the divergent function between hang and angiogenin from other organisms. for example, hang exhibits a ribonucleolytic activity that is weaker than bovine pancreatic rnase a, around  <dig> to  <dig> times less efficient  <cit> , probably due to a single amino acid substitution at position  <dig> of the protein  <cit> . it cleaves preferentially on the 3' side of pyrimidines and follows a transphosphorylation/hydrolysis mechanism when inducing angiogenesis, differing not only in magnitude but also in the specificity for the bovine pancreatic rnasea. whether the angiogenin functional plasticity is correlated with an evolutionary plasticity remains to be tested. to conduct this test it is important to define the set of functional domains and amino acid sites that provide ang its function and to identify the evolutionary/functional potential of this protein--which refers to the potential of this protein to evolve towards novel functions. functional and comparative structural analyses have been paramount to unravel key sites for ang function . many of these studies have specifically assigned functions to particular amino acid sites within the ang protein. for example, his <dig>  lys <dig> and his <dig> have been shown to be essential in the catalytic activity of ang  <cit> .

mouse is the model used to study the implications of mutations at angiogenin in some human illnesses and studies of murine angiogenin  have highlighted a burst of other amino acid sites essential for its activity including: i) the b <dig> binding site comprising thr <dig> and ser <dig>  <cit> ; ii) the poorly conserved b <dig> binding site, that binds a purine ring on the opposite side of the scissile bond, with glu <dig> being key at this functional domain  <cit> ; iii) the p <dig> site that facilitates, in conjunction with b <dig> binding site, the binding of ang to the nucleus of the cell owing this activity to the amino acids arg <dig> and his <dig>  <cit> ; and iv) another putative binding site that has been described to be required for ang activity, covering the range of residues asn <dig> to asn <dig>  residues ala <dig> to phe <dig> and residue asn <dig>  previous studies pointed to the possible implication of some of these residues  in the binding of ang to the cell and in causing aggregation rather than purine binding as in the case of rnasea  <cit> . in addition to these regions, there is a nuclear localization signal that spans amino acids arg31-leu <dig> of mang  <cit> .

due to the variable copy numbers for mang generated by gene duplication, mang become a questionable model to infer the effect of mutations in hang, because the functional constraints on amino acid sites in ang may have changed after gene duplication. this problem is magnified in mice for which six different ang paralogs genes have been so far described , all resulting from tandem duplications of the hang ortholog . only four out of the six copies  have been tested for activity. among these, mang <dig>  mang <dig> and mang <dig> present a ribonuclolytic and angiogenic activity .

sites involved in ang activity have been identified through comparative structural analyses and functional data  <cit> . moreover, mang <dig> has been reported to lack angiogenic activity and has been considered to be a pseudo-gene  <cit> . to date, no function has been reported for either mang <dig> or mang <dig>  recent studies have provided evidence for the action of diversifying selection post-dating the duplication events that gave rise to five of the mang <dig> paralogs  <cit> . adaptive evolution has also been found in the duplicated gene of ang from rats   <cit>  and primates  <cit> . aside from these studies, exhaustive analyses of evolutionary dynamics and structural constraints at this gene in mice remain unperformed.

here we present an evolutionary study of the duplicated ang genes in mice to identify amino acid regions that may have played key roles in its functional diversification. we test for the fixation of adaptive amino acid replacements after mang duplication events to identify shifts on the functional constraints of amino acids after gene duplication and we explore the structural consequences of such shifts. we finally discuss on the putative functional roles of the different ang proteins in mouse based on our evolutionary analyses.

RESULTS
evolutionary history of ang
the aim of this study was to understand the evolutionary dynamics post-dating the different duplication events in mang. the phylogenetic position of mang was paramount to infer accurately the evolutionary processes corresponding to each of the multiple duplication events. maximum-likelihood approach identified jtt with a heterogeneous distribution of substitution rates among sites  as the best evolutionary model to use in ang alignments. we tested the support of the phylogenetic position of mang in two ways. in the first method we inferred the bootstrap support values for each of the node using  <dig> alignment pseudo-replicates and inferring the support for each of the nodes. the resulting phylogenetic tree  supported five mouse specific repeated duplication events, while a single duplication could be reliably assigned to the rat lineage . the second approach involved the comparison of the likelihoods for the four alternative phylogenetic positions of mang. these comparisons were performed using the hasegawa-shimodaira  test  <cit> , which is implemented in the program paml version <dig>  this test pointed to the tree of figure  <dig> as the most likely hypothesis for the position of mang <dig>  given our alignments . we therefore used this topology in all our downstream evolutionary analyses.

among the most interesting observations when examining the tree of figure  <dig> is that repeated ang gene duplication events occurred during the radiation of murine and rat clades . these duplication events led to the asymmetric expansion of the ang proteins in both these lineages with the mouse lineage showing a substantial amount of paralogs  as compared to the rat lineage, which showed only two paralogs . rat paralogs present symmetric branch lengths and hence equal evolutionary rates. unlike rat, mice paralogs show substantial differences in their evolutionary rates  hinting their possible functional divergence after gene duplication. the nature and consequences of this functional divergence are elusive and more analyses are needed to determine whether such divergence led to neo-functionalisation or sub-functinalisation of the paralog copies. mice present large effective population sizes in comparison to human and hence the probability for neo-functionalisation in mice is greater than in humans. theoretical and population genetics data predict that in large populations strong constraints act against slightly deleterious mutations, hindering the subsequent fixation of compensatory mutations, and consequently the probability of sub-functionalisation is lower than that of neo-functionalisation  <cit> . regardless the final outcome, asymmetry between mice paralogs point to the fixation of burst of mutations by adaptive evolution, which may have driven mang copies to angiogenin functional diversification. the asymmetry in mice angiogenin paralogs is substantial, but what is the selective value of this asymmetry? and what changes have been essential for mang functional diversification?

diversifying selection has driven the evolution of mang copies
to identify events of diversifying selection in the murine angiogenin, we applied the maximum likelihood based models implemented in the program codeml of the paml package. in addition, we applied the parsimony sliding window approach implemented in the program swapsc. this second approach was convenient for several reasons: i) the sliding window approach allows identifying regions of the proteins under diversifying selection, or other non-neutral selective constraints such as accelerated rates of evolution and mutation hotspots; and ii) swapsc accounts for nucleotide bias and for non-neutral evolution of synonymous sites.

maximum likelihood based approach supported a heterogeneous distribution of the intensities of selection throughout the phylogeny, as pinpointed by the fact that free-ratio model outperformed significantly the model of goldman and yang . using the intermediate model b implemented in codeml, we tested the direct hypothesis of the evolution of each branch before and after duplication events in mice . model b identified several of the branches to have undergone different selection constraints before gene duplication compared to after each of the several gene duplication events. swapsc also detected the action of adaptive evolution in specific branches of the tree convergently with maximum likelihood analyses. for example, branch a , which leads to the ancestor of all the duplication events in the murine lineage, and branch g, which leads to mang <dig>  were found to be under positive selection using both approaches. positive selection at these branches was supported by non-synonymous-to-synonymous rates ratio of ω =  <dig>  and ω =  <dig>  in the case of branch a and ω =  <dig>  and ω =  <dig>  for branch g, as computed by maximum likelihood and sliding window analyses, respectively.

branch f , which leads to the ancestor of mang <dig> and mang <dig>  was detected to be under positive selection using codeml as the estimated ω = ∞ was greater than one, although synonymous changes were estimated to be  <dig> and therefore we should be careful in interpreting this result. in branch a we found several sites under ps, including amino acids spanning the region between met <dig> and gly <dig>  importantly, this region includes the sites responsible for the nuclear localization of the protein  <cit> . at branch g several sites were found to be under positive selection using both approaches, including residues ser <dig> to gly <dig>  although the functional importance of some of these amino acids is as yet unknown, some of the residues detected to have undergone positive selection have been reported to be close or directly involved in the nuclear localization region of mang   <cit> . this could be an indication that functional divergence of mang <dig> was due to positively selected amino acid replacements at these sites.

inspecting the rest of the branches leading to the different duplicates we found that branch h, which leads to mang <dig> , seems to have been evolving under negative selection, with ω =  <dig>  and ω =  <dig>  for maximum likelihood and sliding window, respectively. in contrast some branches such as branch d, which leads to the ancestor of mang <dig>  mang <dig> and mang <dig>  seems to have been evolving neutrally . similar results were obtained for branch e , that corresponds to the mang <dig> lineage and branch i , that leads to mang <dig>  this neutral evolution points to the possible non-functionalization of these copies, but as mang <dig> and mang <dig> have been shown to be functional, we expected mang <dig> to be functional as well; we show further analysis that point to this hypothesis as the most plausible one.

interesting was the case of branch c, mang <dig> , because it seems to have been evolving at the same rate  as the rest of the species included in the phylogenetic analysis . it has been described that mang <dig> is a possible pseudo-gene, however we have not detected any evidence for relaxed constraints in this lineage in comparison with other lineages of the mammalian tree that could suggest neutral fixation of amino acid replacing nucleotide substitutions . conversely, mang <dig> seem to have undergone moderate purifying selection.

gene's expression is one of the main factors affecting evolutionary rates, with expressed genes being those highly conserved. to account for this when comparing non-synonymous-to-synonymous rates ratios among mang gene copies we investigated the expression of each of the copies using codon adaptation index  as a proxy to gene expression. cai was calculated using the webpage http://www.cbib.u-bordeaux <dig> fr/pise/cai.html. the values of non-synonymous-to-synonymous nucleotide substitutions are not due to different expression levels of the gene copies because, on average, the different mang copies presented similar expression levels . these gene copies also presented similar expression levels to that of hang . difference in evolutionary rates therefore was not due to differences in expression levels among duplicates.

the fact that these copies remain in the proteome of mouse argues against previous studies suggesting non-functionalisation  <cit> . in addition, all post-duplication lineages presented similar intensities of selection except the pairs of post-duplication lineages f-g  and h-i that lead to mang <dig> and mang <dig>  respectively . the elevated ω values are more consistent with shifts in the evolutionary rates after gene duplication and with the possible functional divergence of the resulting paralogous copies. in the first pair , both post-duplication lineages underwent adaptive evolution  indicating the possible functional divergence type ii . functional divergence type ii involves a change of the ancestral amino acid at a particular amino acid site of the protein after gene duplication. this replacement involves the fixation of two different residues in the post-duplication lineages and their high conservation after the speciation of each of the copies due to their different but equally important functional role in each of the paralogs. conversely, both post-duplication lineages in the second pair  evolved under purifying selection, although mang <dig> presented significantly accelerated rates of evolution compared to mang <dig>  indicating possible functional divergence type i . unlike functional divergence type ii, type i involves the fixation of a function conferring residue mutation in one of the paralogs where it becomes highly constrained, while this amino acid sites evolves neutrally in the other where amino acid replacements occur with no functional consequences.

co-evolution between residues proximal to functional regions in ang
relaxed selection is a common phenomenon after gene duplication and it can take place in one or both copies of the gene because of gene redundancy  <cit> . one of the gene copies therefore may accumulate deleterious mutations while the other copy can remain under strong purifying selection to preserve the ancestral function. the most expected fate for one of the gene copies is non-functionalization followed by its disintegration within few million years of evolution depending on the effective population sizes of the organism  <cit> . the two copies of a gene can persist in the genome either if the combined function of both paralogs performs the ancestral function  or if one copy reproduces the ancestral function while the other diverges towards other functions . survival of a pseudo-gene in the genome for long evolutionary periods is very unlikely, and therefore copies that remain are likely to be functional. however, evolution of gene copies after duplication can be very complex and up to twelve models have been recently proposed to account for all possible evolutionary scenarios  <cit> . based on this assumption, we examined whether the mang gene copies that were kept in the genome were followed by functional divergence after duplication. functional divergence is likely to happen in two ways: i) classic functional divergence involves the accumulation of functionally innovative advantageous mutations in one of the gene copies  <cit> ; or alternatively ii) after gene duplication functionally innovative but structurally destabilizing mutations may have become fixed once they have been compensated for by other mutations : in a normal physiological background the effect of both two mutations is neutral but the phenotypic advantage of the destabilizing mutation may be expressed under novel environmental conditions.

applying the method of gu  <cit>  we could not identify classical functional divergence in any of the considered clusters. to identify the second type of functionally divergent mutations we first performed analysis of co-evolution . the co-evolution method identified several pairs of amino acids showing correlated changes. groups of coevolution --with each group including only amino acids that present correlated evolution with each and all the members of that group -- highlighted several amino acid sites to be correlated in their evolutionary patterns . most of the sites are close  to essential amino acids of the active site , or to the binding sites, or to the domain responsible for the nuclear translocation . these proximities support the possible compensatory relationship between such amino acid sites because their proximity to important functional regions makes it likely that mutations at these sites can have deleterious effects. the next question we asked was whether these constraints have undergone substantial changes after gene duplication. to answer this question and the hypothesis of compensatory effects we analysed the distribution of co-evolving pairs of amino acid sites in the protein structure and tested their proximities.

amino acid position and residue  of the detected amino acids is included.

detection of compensatory mutations
in order to understand the relationships between co-evolving amino acids in ang, we plotted these in the crystal structure of hang and asked whether pairs of co-evolving residues presented evidence of interaction with one another. in spite of the fact that mang <dig> and mang <dig> have been isolated and crystallized, we used hang as a reference structure due to the medical relevance of this protein for humans and because it was identical to mang. all other mouse ang structure copies have been synthetically modified from the mang <dig> in previous studies. the procedure utilized to answer this question consisted in determining whether the pair of co-evolving residues was located within 4Å from each other, being indicative of their possible functional or structural interactions. alternatively, for those distantly located amino acids , we asked whether they were contacting common amino acids that showed highly conserved evolutionary pattern . many of the co-evolving amino acids presented distances greater than 4Å . importantly, most of these amino acids were proximal to residues that showed a significantly conserved evolutionary pattern compared to the rest of the alignment . this method was used previously with significant success to identify compensatory relationships between mutations  <cit> . the highly conserved sites identified nearby co-evolving residues are close to the sites responsible for the ribonuclease activity and to those involved in the translocation of the protein to the nucleus.

after examining the different co-evolution groups we found that groups g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  presented pairs of amino acids with strong evidence for their compensatory effects--that is to say they fall within  <dig> Å of each other in the protein structure and are therefore likely to present interacting effects. the pair of amino acid sites asp41-lys <dig> , classified within co-evolution group g <dig> , presented evidence of compensatory effects. asp <dig> and lys <dig> are involved in dimerization of angiogenine and are closely located to amino acid regions that interact with inhibitors and the catalytic centre . another example of possible compensatory interaction is that presented by the pair of amino acid sites lys73-asn <dig>  that are classified within group g <dig> . importantly, this pair of amino acids is located structurally close to the putative binding site . his84-gln <dig> and his84-thr <dig> where detected as compensatory and they are in two co-evolutionary groups, g <dig>  and g <dig> . these sites are close to catalytic sites and are both involved in binding the inhibitor of angiogenin. the pair his84-ile <dig> was also found as a coadaptation pair in g <dig> . another pair thr97-ala <dig>  which has been consistently detected to co-evolve in many of the groups, also presented evidence for a compensatory relationship in g <dig>  and g <dig> . thr <dig> and ala <dig> are involved in angiogenin dimerization . in g <dig>  we also found other compensatory mutations lys82-gln <dig> and lys82-thr <dig>  all compensatory mutations have been highlighted in red in figure  <dig>  it is interesting to notice that, although many of the sites detected to be under adaptive evolution fall within the same domains of those co-evolving , there was no match between these two sets of sites. one possible reason may be purely methodological because both selection and functional divergence analyses have been performed in a qualitatively different manner. in selection analyses we focused the detection of adaptation on particular lineages of the tree. conversely, in co-evolution the entire tree was used which makes it more difficult to identify selection at co-evolving amino acid sites: pairs of amino acids that changed in a correlated way in few lineages may have undergone strong purifying selection in most of the remaining lineages of the tree. this would imply that on average these sites would be under strong negative selection most of the time alternating with punctual episodic adaptive evolution, which would be unlikely to be detected by actual selection methods. we consider therefore both the selection methods and co-evolutionary analyses to be complementary approaches to identify adaptive evolutionary events.

we identify highly conserved amino acid sites  that are structurally close to or within functionally important regions of ang protein and that are close  to coevolving pairs with potential compensatory relationships. in bold we highlight those co-evolving amino acid positions reported to be involved in dimmer formation of hang, in italic we remark positions implicated in the interaction with angiogenin-inhibitor in human. we finally underscore those positions identified to be important as catalytic sites in hang, as described in ncbi-ibis database  <cit> .

structural bases of amino acid variability in mang
to understand the structural basis of amino acid variability among the mang copies, we modelled three-dimensional structures for the different mang copies that lack such structure  by homology using the program 3d-jigsaw  <cit> . several ang structures are available in the databases, including three belonging to mice  and many other belonging to synthetic versions of humans or resulting from different approaches of crystallization. two of the mang structures belong to mang <dig>  but have been crystallized using different protocols, while a third structure  belongs to mang <dig>  we however adopted the hang  as a reference to number all sites because the remaining human structures are highly similar in sequence and structure to this one. to identify differences among the six copies of mouse angiogenin proteins' structures we used the program ccomp, which measures the distance between the mass centres of amino acids of two structures by the root mean square deviation  <cit> . although we observed no important differences in the structure among the ang copies , our results point to the possible blockage of the active site in mang <dig>  which may explain the lack of mang1-like activity . the similarity at the structural level but the difference regarding the functional site supports the hypothesis of functional shift after the duplication, which may have given rise to mang <dig> and its departure from an angiogenic activity. this result also argues against the non-functionalization of any of the mouse ang copies. unlike mang <dig>  mang <dig> has been previously reported to be active  <cit> , although we observed an important difference in the structural configuration of the active centre when compared to mang1--that is to say, the active centre of one copy was structurally displaced and presented slight structural differences when compared to the other copy .

similarly to mang <dig>  mang <dig> shows a structural departure from mang <dig> in the active centre with evidence of activity blockage . this supports the previously observed poor angiogenic activity and the suggested involvement of mang in other processes  <cit> .

finally, our selective constraints analyses show evidence of adaptive evolution in mang <dig>  the fact that our structural modelling detects a structurally different active centre in this protein compared to other protein copies where we detect adaptive evolution suggests functional divergence after the split between mang <dig> and the remaining ang copies. furthermore, intra-molecular co-evolutionary analyses show evidence of compensatory mutations events located nearby important functional regions of the ang protein. for example, pro <dig> and thr <dig>  frequently identified as coevolving with many other residues in the structure, are probably responsible of the operability of the active site as its location suggests its role in maintaining the proper orientation of sites his <dig> and thr <dig> that belong to the active site. the rest of the pairs of coevolution are mostly surrounding the active site--which comprises amino acids his <dig>  thr <dig> and his <dig>  others are either included within or surrounding the nuclear peptide signal . these results indicate therefore that, in general, amino acid sites close or included in important protein domains may have coevolved to maintain the structural features necessary for the proper functional activity of angiogenin. we have also detected two groups of compensatory mutations in mang after duplication. the importance of these sites is further enhanced by their location in or nearby amino acids arg <dig> to leu <dig> that have been described to be involved in the nuclear localization of the protein in mouse  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
even though all the duplicates in mouse are different from mang <dig>  and that nothing has been described for mang <dig> and mang <dig>  there is no reason to think that these copies are non-functional. remarkably it has been reported the non-nuclear localization of mang <dig>  the identification of positive selection in amino acids involved in the nuclear localization of the protein may be related to a functional shift of this angiogenin mouse copy. moreover, mang <dig> seems to be functional in contrast to previous reports.

in conclusion, our analyses yield novel results that shed light on the mutational dynamics of angiogenin when exploring diversifying natural selection and functional divergence. we present the structural and functional interpretations for these evolutionary dynamics and provide a list of amino acid sites that are likely to have a functional impact on the mang copies suitable for further experimental testing. we also reject the previously supported non-functionalization of duplicated mang based on evolutionary and structural analyses and we invite researchers for a rather more detailed investigation of the roles and redundancies of duplicated angiogenin genes.
