BACKGROUND
bone morphogenetic proteins  are members of the tgf-β superfamily and were originally identified by their ability to induce endochondral bone formation  <cit> . there are at least  <dig> bmp family members and they are involved in a myriad of biological processes both during embryonic development and adult life. these include pluripotency of embryonic stem cells  <cit> , dorsoventral patterning of the mesoderm, neurogenesis, hematopoiesis, somite formation, osteoblastic differentiation and bone homeostasis  <cit> .

bmps are synthesized as precursor proteins that are intracellularly proteolytically cleaved following dimerization to produce active mature protein dimers. the bmps signal via hetero-oligomeric complexes of combinations of three type ii receptors:- bmp receptor type ii , activin a receptor type iia  and acvr2b  and four type i receptors:- acvrl <dig> , acvr <dig> , bmpr1a  and bmpr1b   <cit> . following ligand induced receptor hetero-oligomerization the type i receptors are activated by type ii receptor mediated phosphorylation events. the receptor complexes then transduce their signals via activation of the canonical smad pathway and several non-smad signalling pathways. the receptor regulated smads , smad <dig>  smad <dig> and smad <dig> are directly phosphorylated by the type i receptor kinases which enables complex formation with the co-smad, smad <dig>  r-smad/smad <dig> complexes accumulate in the nucleus and regulate target gene expression by binding to gene regulatory elements and recruiting transcriptional co-repressor and/or activation complexes  <cit> .

as well as playing critical roles in normal physiological processes, dysregulation of bmp signalling can have pathophysiological consequences  <cit> . mutations of bmp receptors have been observed in several human pathologies. for example, inactivation of alk <dig> results in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type  <dig>   <cit>  and mutations of bmpr <dig> are found in primary pulmonary arterial hypertension patients  <cit>  and pancreatic cancers  <cit> . similarly, polymorphisms/mutations have also been observed in bmps in several human pathologies  <cit> . evidence is also accumulating to suggest that aberrant expression of the bmps may also have pathological consequences. decreased expression of bmp <dig> in primary breast cancer specimens has been associated with bone metastasis  <cit>  and is reduced in advanced prostate adenocarcinoma  <cit> . in contrast elevated bmp <dig> levels correlate with shorter tumour recurrence in malignant melanoma  <cit>  and increased bmp <dig> levels in colorectal cancer correlates with depth of tumour invasion, liver metastasis, advanced duke's classification and poor prognosis  <cit> . elevated levels of bmp <dig> have also been observed in the synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis patients  <cit> . bmp <dig> levels have also been found to increase in late colonic adenocarcinomas and are higher in primary colonic carcinomas with liver metastasis than matched normal mucosa  <cit> . bmp <dig> levels have been observed to decrease in diffuse large b cell lymphoma and correlate with reduced survival  <cit>  and to be elevated in prostate cancer  <cit> . bmp <dig> expression has also been observed to be elevated in lung tumours  <cit> .

the observations that bmp signalling may play important roles in both normal and aberrant physiology suggest that the ability to conveniently measure bmp bioactivity in biological samples may have clinical diagnostic and prognostic value and this has driven the development of elisa  <cit> , enzyme linked immunoreceptor assays   <cit>  and cell based assays to measure bmp activity  <cit> . the inhibitor of differentiation transcription factor id <dig> is an immediate early bmp target gene and the bmp responsive elements of the human and mouse id <dig> promoters have been well characterised  <cit> . synthetic engineering of two copies of the bmp response elements of the mouse id <dig> gene enabled the generation of a highly specific and sensitive bmp responsive luciferase based reporter construct termed bre-luc  <cit> . recent reports have described the development of bre-luc based bioassays in stable reporter cell lines which are capable of measuring the activity of bmp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . here we describe the development of a c2c <dig> bre-luc bioassay cell line. we demonstrate that this cell line is capable of measuring the activity of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> at physiological concentrations and show that by using isoform specific blocking antibodies this assay can be used to measure simultaneously the levels of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> in fetal calf serum  and human serum samples. this assay paves the way for measuring the activity of multiple bmps in complex biological samples.

RESULTS
generation of a stable bmp reporter cell line
the bmp responsive c2c <dig> mouse myoblast cell line was stably transfected with the bre-luc construct which contains the bmp responsive elements of the mouse id <dig> gene cloned into the pgl <dig> luciferase vector  <cit> . multiple stable clones were tested for bmp inducibility in media containing  <dig> % serum by treatment with  <dig> ng/ml recombinant bmp <dig> . clone  <dig>  was found to be the most sensitive  and was used for all subsequent experiments. this cell line was maintained in  <dig>  mg/ml g <dig> for routine passage and tested at each passage for bmp responsiveness. we found no change in the bmp responsiveness of c2c12bre cells measured over  <dig> passages and after multiple rounds of storage in liquid nitrogen and re-culture .

dose dependent induction of luciferase by multiple bmps in c2c12bre cells
having established that the c2c12bre cells were sensitive to bmp <dig> treatment we investigated the dose dependent effects of multiple recombinant bmps on this cell line. cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant human bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  all  <dig> bmps tested stimulated luciferase activity in a dose dependent manner, with maximal stimulation reached with > <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>  > <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig> . we next assessed the specificity of the assay for bmps by treating the cells with other members of the tgf-β superfamily. tgf-β <dig>  nodal and mullerian inhibiting substance  failed to increase luciferase activity, even at concentrations as high as  <dig> ng/ml  tgf-β <dig>   <dig> ng/ml  nodal or  <dig> ng/ml  mis . having observed that bmps stimulate luciferase production in c2c12bre cells over a range of concentrations in an isoform specific fashion, we next determined the linear range of the assay with each bmp tested. we found that the assay maintained linearity up to  <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig> . using these titration analyses we also determined the lower sensitivity limits for each bmp. we could reproducibly measure as little as  <dig>  ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig>  ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig>  ng/ml  bmp <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig> . thus, this assay is sensitive and robust enough to measure  <dig> – <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig> – <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>   <dig> – <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig>  1– <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig> and 1– <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig> 

simultaneous measurement of multiple bmps from biological samples
the ability of the assay to measure many different bmps over physiological concentrations prompted us to investigate if we could use the assay in combination with specific blocking antibodies to measure the activity of different bmps in biological samples. as the assay could measure bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> over at least a tenfold range of concentrations we focused our efforts on these isoforms. first we determined the ability of commercially available blocking antibodies to block induction of reporter activity by recombinant bmps. cells were treated with an excess of recombinant bmps  bmp <dig>   <dig> ng/ml  bmp <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml  bmp9) with or without a  <dig> minute pre-treatment with increasing concentrations of their matched blocking antibodies. the minimum concentration required for complete inhibition of bmp induced luciferase activity for each bmp was determined as  <dig> ng/ml bmp <dig> antibody ,  <dig> ng/ml bmp <dig> antibody  and  <dig>  ng/ml bmp <dig> antibody . we next assessed the specificity of these blocking antibodies by treating c2c12bre cells with several bmps  and the blocking antibodies for bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> . bmp <dig> induced luciferase activity was only blocked by bmp <dig> antibody , bmp <dig> induced luciferase activity was only blocked by bmp <dig> antibody  and bmp <dig> induced luciferase activity was only blocked by bmp <dig> antibody . likewise, the blocking antibodies only blocked their respective bmp .

we next determined that culture of our cells in 10% fcs did not significantly affect cell proliferation or morphology in our assay conditions . this fact coupled with the sensitivity of the assay and the availability of the specific blocking antibodies allowed us to develop a method for the quantification of a specific bmp in fcs which we used as a test complex biological sample . c2c12bre cells were treated with media containing 10% fcs with and without pre-incubation of the media with  <dig>  ng/ml bmp <dig> blocking antibody. the antibody treated samples produced less relative luciferase units than the untreated samples indicating the presence of bmp <dig> in this serum sample . c2c12bre cells were also treated with three different concentrations of bmp <dig> over the pre-established linear range in parallel to generate a standard curve. by measuring the change in luciferase activity  and then extrapolating this value to the bmp <dig> standard curve we determined that this sample contained  <dig>  ng/ml bmp <dig> .

next we performed a similar analysis by treating cells with three different concentrations within the linear range of recombinant bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> to generate standard curves  and in parallel incubated samples with 10% fcs containing media with and without blocking antibodies to bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  treatment with each of the blocking antibodies revealed that fcs contained all three bmps . measurement of Δ luciferase units and extrapolation to the standard curves indicated that bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> were present in fcs at concentrations ranging from  <dig> – <dig>  ng/ml .

having determined that fcs contains bmps  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> we tested if the concentrations of these bmps varied over different batches of fbs obtained from different sources. we found that treatment of the three serum samples with the bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> blocking antibodies reduced luciferase measurements in all three cases  indicating that these different batches of serum all contained bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  addition of the Δ luciferase obtained with each antibody also indicated that serum  <dig> and serum  <dig> samples contained an additional activity capable of inducing the bre-luc construct indicating that fcs is likely to contain at least one other bmp . the total amount of luciferase activity induced by serum stimulation varied approximately two fold between serum samples  as did the amount of each of the bmps  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . bmp <dig> was found in a higher concentration than bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> in all samples whereas the relative amounts of bmp <dig> to bmp <dig> varied between samples .

having identified and quantified bmp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in fcs we performed similar analysis on human serum samples. we readily detected bmp <dig> in three out of four human serum samples in concentrations ranging from  <dig> – <dig>  ng/ml . similarly we detected from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ng/ml bmp <dig> in all four human serum samples tested . we did not detect bmp <dig> or any other bmp activity in human serum samples . taken together these findings indicate that our assay is capable of determining the relative amounts of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> from complex biological solutions.

discussion
the pleiotropic and fundamental roles of bmps in both normal physiological and pathophysiological processes, indicates that the ability to measure bmp activity may have clinical use. in this paper we describe the development of a highly sensitive and specific assay to measure bmp activity from biological samples. we generated a stable cell clone "c2c12bre" expressing a luciferase reporter under the control of the bmp response elements from the mouse id <dig> promoter. when compared to other available bioassays, our assay has enhanced bmp isoform range, increased sensitivity and is capable of simultaneously measuring multiple individual bmp isoforms from the same complex biological samples.

the most widely used cell based assay to assess bmp activity employs measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity in c2c <dig> myoblast cells  <cit> . however, this assay may lack sufficient sensitivity to measure physiological levels of bmps, takes several days to perform and is susceptible to influence from other signalling pathways  <cit> . recently, other cell based assays using c3ht10t1/ <dig> embryonic mouse cells  <cit> , c2c <dig> and hepg <dig> cells  <cit>  have been described. these assays are capable of measuring bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  we show that our assay is also capable of measuring bmp <dig> levels from 4– <dig> pm and bmp <dig> levels from 40– <dig> pm. our assay has enhanced sensitivity for bmp <dig> , bmp <dig>  and bmp <dig> . elisa assays are commercially available for the measurement of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> but are currently unavailable for bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> elisas are reported to measure  <dig> – <dig> ng/ml  and  <dig> – <dig> ng/ml  similar to the sensitivity of our assay . an elisa for bmp <dig> is reported to measure  <dig> – <dig> ng/ml  similar to our assay sensitivity range . a bmp <dig> elisa is reported to have enhanced sensitivity but limited linearity  when compared to our bioassay . our assay therefore has similar sensitivity to elisa assays but has the advantage that it measures biologically active bmp and not total bmp levels. importantly, we develop the bioassay methodology further and show that by using bmp isoform specific blocking antibodies it is possible to measure the specific activity of individual bmps in complex biological samples whereas previous methods have so far only been capable of detecting total bmp activity. furthermore using recombinant bmps and isoform specific blocking antibodies we demonstrate that is possible to simultaneously quantitate total bmp activity and individual isoform bmp activity from the same biological sample.

as shown in figure  <dig> our assay is specific for bmps as related tgf-β superfamily members tgf-β, nodal and mis had no effect on luciferase activity. by careful titration analysis we were able to define the linear ranges of activity for different bmp isoforms. our assay is most sensitive for measuring the activity of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> and is capable of measuring as little as  <dig> pm of bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> . as we could measure bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> over greater than  <dig> fold ranges of concentrations coupled with the availability of isoform specific blocking antibodies for these species we focused our efforts on developing the assay using these bmps. using recombinant bmps and blocking antibodies we demonstrated that it is possible to determine the specific activity of individual bmps .

we next used fcs as a test complex biological fluid for determining the versatility of our assay. by performing titration analysis with recombinant bmp <dig> and serum stimulation of c2c12bre cells with and without bmp <dig> blocking antibody we discovered that fcs contains high levels of biologically active bmp <dig> ranging from 5– <dig> ng/ml . whilst this paper was in preparation, sabine bailly and colleagues discovered that bmp <dig> is present in human serum at similar concentrations from 2– <dig> ng/ml and acts as a circulating vascular quiescence factor  <cit> . our data indicates that bmp <dig> may also play roles during bovine development and reveals a remarkably conserved steady state level of bmp <dig> in serum samples between species. bmp <dig> has been shown to signal via alk <dig> in endothelial cells  <cit>  and indicates that either c2c <dig> cells express functional alk <dig> or that bmp <dig> may also engage alternative receptors. we are currently investigating these hypotheses. our analysis also revealed that fcs contains bmp <dig> ranging from 3– <dig> ng/ml and bmp <dig> ranging from  <dig> – <dig> ng/ml . bmp <dig> has previously been purified from fcs  <cit>  but our study is the first to measure the concentration of bmp <dig> in fcs. to our knowledge this current study is the first to identify bmp <dig> in fcs. our experiments also revealed that in two out of three fcs samples the combined activity of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> could not account for the total bmp activity in these samples. we therefore conclude that fcs may also contain at least one other bmp isoform . remarkably, our studies reveal that fcs contains high levels of bmp activity and that typical cell culture conditions of 5–10% fcs contain bmp activity from  <dig> – <dig> ng/ml of bmps. given the profound biological effects of bmp signalling on cell biology and the interaction of these events with other signalling cascades, we believe that it is important to consider the potential effects of bmp signalling when assessing tissue culture experimental results.

as well as measuring bmps in fcs we expanded our analysis and found that bmp <dig> is present in human serum in 1– <dig> ng/ml quantities in concordance with recently published findings  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge we identify bmp <dig> as a human serum factor for the first time. we failed to detect bmp <dig> or any other bmp activity capable of inducing bre-luc in human serum indicating that bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> maybe the only circulating bmps present in normal human serum.

an increasing body of evidence is revealing that aberrant bmp signalling and changes in bmp levels may have important biological consequences during normal and pathophysiological processes  <cit> . we have demonstrated that our bioassay is capable of measuring the activity of individual bmp isoforms from serum samples. it is an exciting possibility that determination of bmp levels in patient biological samples such as serum, or body cavity fluids may have prognostic and/or diagnostic utility in the management of human disease. recent studies have also suggested the possibility of using recombinant bmps to treat osteogenic disease  <cit> . the use of bmp bioassays may also be useful in monitoring the bioactivity of bmps in these clinical settings. our assay could also be used in determining the specificity and efficacy of agents designed to target bmp signalling. with the increasing availability of commercial bmp blocking antibodies and recombinant proteins it should be possible to broaden the applicability of our bioassay. furthermore, by extrapolating the methodology we describe new cell lines capable of measuring further isoforms of bmp for the use in laboratory research and clinical practice could be developed.

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated a rapid, sensitive and specific bioassay for the simultaneous measurement of total and individual isoform bmp activity from complex biological solutions. this assay can be used to study bmp activity in experimental and clinical settings and to screen for pharmacological modifiers of bmp signalling.
