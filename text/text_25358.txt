BACKGROUND
there have been many studies about groups of genes and their transcription factors , called transcriptional modules, by integrating heterogeneous data sources such as chromatin immunoprecipitation on microarray , gene expression data and cis-regulatory motifs  <cit> . chip-chip data alone do not possess functional regulatory information and gene expression data alone do not contain physical binding information. data integration tries to compensate for such limitations of a single type of data source alone. this process can often generate more complete biological hypotheses than those from each data source separately. a particularly important issue in biology is to discriminate regulatory binding of tfs from mere physical binding events. one way to tackle this problem is to integrate functional data such as gene expression with physical binding data such as chip-chip  <cit> .

modules are believed to be a fundamental organizational unit of cellular networks  <cit> . transcriptional modules are one type of such modules related to gene regulatory networks of tfs and target genes. the computational studies mentioned above aimed at the identification of such modules as independent or inter-connected functional units in regulatory networks. experimentalists face the challenge to verify predicted modules in their functional contexts at the level of all individual links. this is currently impossible as the number of regulatory links in modules predicted from large-scale data analysis is in the order of thousands. in this work, we aim to prioritize regulatory interactions in transcriptional modules as an attempt to overcome this issue.

our approach starts with putative transcriptional modules  derived from genome-wide chip-chip data . these ptms are defined by all possible combinations  of regulators and their respective bound genes at a given chip-chip p-value threshold  <cit> . then our algorithm identifies a subset of ptms which are  coherent in expression profiles of target genes and at the same time  enriched in functional categories . that is, both gene expression and functional annotation data are used to extract functional signals after binding signals are retrieved from chip-chip data. we use the terms, 'functional' and 'regulatory', interchangeably when we discuss tf binding throughout this study. all links between tfs and target genes in the identified subset of ptms, called coherent modules, are considered candidate functional links. the goal is then to narrow down those candidate functional links to core functional links. our key strategy is to focus on intersections of coherent modules for all enriched functional categories . this short list of tf-gene pairs is our predicted functional pairs and consequently has priority over the others in coherent modules for further mechanistic analysis or experimental validation.

our method is applied to chip-chip data by lee et al.  <cit> , gene expression data by spellman et al.  <cit> , and mips functional category data  <cit> . we evaluate our method in terms of the number of true functional links between tfs and target genes among our predictions with respect to two reference datasets . we also compare our method with two previous algorithms, gram  <cit>  and ma-networker  <cit> , which integrated two of our data sources, chip-chip and gene expression data. finally, we investigate our predictions in more detail and focus on those predicted tf-gene pairs whose expression profiles are highly correlated with each other. this further enables us to suggest functional interaction among gene products and novel conserved binding sites for those pairs.

RESULTS
putative transcriptional modules
we generated a total of  <dig> putative transcriptional modules  by taking all non-empty subsets of  <dig> tfs from chip-chip data by lee et al. with a binding p-value threshold  <dig>  . we imposed a constraint of the minimum number of target genes in all modules being  <dig> for the purpose of statistical assessment in our subsequent analysis. the list of ptms was examined in subsequent analysis by incorporating gene expression and functional annotation data.

prioritization of tf-gene functional links from coherent modules
in contrast to earlier works on identification of transcriptional modules themselves, we seek to identify only the most reliable tf-gene functional links from those modules. to this end, we first identify coherent modules from ptms using expression and functional annotation data . we have two p-value threshold parameters to define coherent modules: one for expression coherence  and the other for function coherence . given two threshold parameters, we predict regulatory tf-gene pairs from functional intersection of identified coherent modules . we varied the parameters by taking all combinations of four significant thresholds:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . then, positive predictive values  were calculated with respect to the combined reference of the literature and conserved motif references . in this work, we report all results based on τe =  <dig>  and τf =  <dig> , which gives the highest ppv among the  <dig> combinations . with this combination of p-value thresholds, we obtained  <dig> coherent modules with a total of  <dig> coherent functional categories .  <dig> out of the  <dig> enriched functions are shared by at least two of  <dig> coherent modules with common target genes, i.e., coherent linker genes. this functional intersection resulted in  <dig> coherent linker genes and  <dig> associated tfs, yielding  <dig> tf-gene functional pairs as represented in figure  <dig> . notice that coherent modules themselves are not the focus of our analysis.

evaluation
validation
we first confirmed the validity of our method by assessing our predicted tf-gene functional pairs in view of the chip-chip data we started with . we calculated the two performance measures, positive predictive value  and sensitivity , with respect to literature and conserved motif reference datasets . as shown in table  <dig>  we obtained higher ppvs at the expense of lower snsts, which is to be expected as we aim at prioritization of regulatory links for individual experimental validation.

we also investigated whether coherent modules themselves or functional intersection alone could have given us better performance than our combined strategy . first, taking all pairs in coherent modules without functional intersection does not yield higher ppvs at the expense of snsts for both reference sets , indicating that functional intersection is an important step. second, we took tf-gene pairs from functional intersection of the initial ptms from the chip-chip data  without applying the expression coherence test. this functional intersection from the initial ptms yields higher ppv than our predictions  for the literature reference but lower ppv than ours  for the conserved motif reference . this suggests that functional intersection is the key to good performance with respect to literature. however, using conserved motifs as a reference, the ppv  is lower than the ppvs from either the chip-chip results alone  or coherent modules above  . on the other hand, the snsts after this functional intersection are lower than our predictions for both reference sets . therefore, the combination of both prescriptions is important for detecting regulatory signals from chip-chip data. further support for validation of our method is presented in additional file  <dig> 

comparison with other methods
the performance of our validated method was compared with results from two previous algorithms, gram  <cit>  and ma-networker  <cit> , using the literature and conserved motif references. both studies used the same chip-chip data by lee et al. and different expression datasets which they combined from diverse publications . we used the published results in their original papers for comparison. the gram algorithm predicted  <dig> tf-gene pairs  and the ma-networker  <dig> pairs.  <dig> pairs from gram and  <dig> pairs from ma-networker overlap with our  <dig> pairs and  <dig> pairs were predicted by all the three algorithms . we observe that our method has higher ppv than the two methods and lower in snsts for both reference sets . on the other hand, the two overlaps of  <dig> pairs and  <dig> pairs with the two algorithms give rise to yet higher ppvs with respect to the literature reference: 27% and 18% respectively. for the conserved motif reference case, the overlaps yield 50% and 45% ppvs respectively, which are similar to our performance of 48%. of the  <dig> pairs predicted by all three algorithms,  <dig> pairs are found in the literature reference and  <dig> pairs in the conserved motif reference .

to illustrate the generic applicability of our approach, which does not depend on our definition of modules, we applied the functional intersection to the  <dig> final modules of the gram algorithm. this may be considered as analogous to our expression coherent modules in the absence of incorporation of functional annotation data. then, ppvs were calculated and compared with those of their final modules for the two reference sets. the functional intersection yielded  <dig> pairs between  <dig> tfs and  <dig> genes  with higher ppvs than their own modules;  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the literature and conserved motif reference sets respectively . this illustrates that our approach of functional intersection may be applied to any set of modules identified in other works to yield more reliable regulatory links.

finally, we present results of an additional comparison with a recent module prediction study by lemmens et al.  <cit> . their work integrated three types of data sources , rather than two as in gram and ma-networker. by applying our method to the same chip-chip and gene expression data  <cit>  as in their study, we predicted  <dig> regulatory interactions and yielded  <dig> % ppv with respect to the literature reference. for a comparison, we used their "seed modules" which contain  <dig> tf-gene interactions, a comparable number of predictions to ours. their  <dig> predictions yielded  <dig> % ppv with respect to the literature reference we used. although the prediction accuracies are similar, there is only little overlap between the predicted sets of regulatory interactions . see additional file  <dig> for more details on this comparison with lemmens et al.

examples
we now continue with detailed inspections of some of our systematic results shown in figure  <dig>  it is well-known that activity profiles of tf proteins are not necessarily reflected in expression profiles of the corresponding genes because of post-transcriptional and post-translational regulations of tfs  <cit> . we took, however, any such correlation as an additional indicator of a functional relationship among our predictions and aimed at identifying all tf-target pairs with high correlation for detailed analysis. to this end, we calculated pearson coefficients for our predicted tf-gene pairs and compared them with a background distribution of pearson coefficients for all pairs between ~ <dig> tfs of harbison et al.  <cit>  and all other genes. by taking those observed pairs whose coefficients fall within 5% of both tails from the distribution of all the coefficients , we obtained a list of  <dig> highly correlated pairs between  <dig> tfs and  <dig> target genes:  <dig> positively and  <dig> negatively correlated pairs . in the following we restricted ourselves to some of these more specific tf-gene pairs.

functionally interacting proteins
as an application from our functional tf-gene predictions, the  <dig> pairs with high expression correlation can provide a basis for identifying functional interactions of proteins. we hypothesize that those target genes regulated by the same tf with high expression correlation have related roles in more specific biological processes than those encapsulated by the 3rd level mips category. in figure  <dig>  we observe that some groups of genes are highly correlated with their common tfs. they include known examples such as the associations between hir <dig> and the six histone genes  <cit> , and the known role of ino <dig> in the regulation of fas <dig> and fas <dig>  <cit> .

as another such group of genes, our method yielded a group of  <dig> genes, kre <dig>  exg <dig>  scw <dig>  psa <dig> and hxk <dig>  which are highly correlated with their common regulator swi <dig> . all these genes share a high-level annotation of 'c-compound and carbohydrate metabolism'. there is no literature evidence for the transcriptional regulation by swi <dig>  but all genes were found to have binding sites of swi <dig> conserved in at least one other yeast species  <cit> . previous experimental studies show that  <dig> out of the  <dig> gene products, kre <dig>  exg <dig>  scw <dig> and psa <dig>  are related to the cell wall synthesis and that cell wall genes are controlled by cell cycle progression where swi <dig> has a regulatory role  <cit> . the  <dig> proteins are specifically implicated in synthesis of either glucose chains  or mannose-bound proteins  which are two main inter-connected components of the cell wall.

the remaining protein, hxk <dig> , is known to be a major upstream regulator of the glucose signalling pathway, which also impedes on cell wall genes. specifically, a glucan synthase subunit, gsc <dig>  is regulated by hxk <dig> via snf <dig> and mig <dig>  <cit> . hence, it is possible that hxk <dig> is functionally related to the  <dig> other gene products through glucose regulation and utilization for glucan synthesis. glucose signalling is also known to act downstream on the cell-cycle, although the precise mechanisms are not yet fully understood  <cit> . our result may suggest a possible feedback onto glucose regulation through the regulatory interaction of swi <dig> with hxk <dig> 

conserved binding sites for three regulators of cis3
we predicted two target genes cis <dig> and uth <dig> regulated by three tfs, swi <dig>  fkh <dig> and ndd <dig>  the expression profile of cis <dig>  is highly correlated with all those three tfs , which additionally supports functional regulation of the gene by the three tfs. on the other hand, uth <dig> is not well correlated with the tfs , hence we do not postulate a functional interaction between cis <dig> and uth <dig>  in contrast to the analysis in the previous subsection. while conserved binding sites for all the three tfs were found upstream of uth <dig>  harbison et al.  <cit>  did not identify any conserved binding sites upstream of cis <dig> 

as we predicted that the three tfs functionally regulate cis <dig>  we searched for any putative binding sites of those tfs and their conservation across species in the upstream region of the gene. to this end, we used the matrices for swi <dig>  ndd <dig> and fkh <dig> provided by harbison et al.  <cit>  and scanned the  <dig> kb upstream region of cis <dig> for matrix hits above the balanced thresholds introduced by rahmann et al.  <cit> . we set the gc content of the background model to 50%. all putative binding sites detected are located within  <dig> base pairs . for the investigation of conservation of the putative tfbs region, we used the fungal sequence alignment tool in sgd  <cit>  and found a high degree of conservation for  <dig> orthologous upstream regions .

it is worth noting that ndd1-fkh <dig> interactions have been suggested to be important in regulating g2/m-specific genes in cell cycle together with the mads box protein, mcm <dig>  forming a permanent protein-dna complex  <cit> . in fact, the position specific frequency matrix of ndd <dig> from the study of harbison et al. is very similar to that of mcm <dig>  so we were able to detect a binding site overlapping with that of mcm <dig> . this indicates that ndd <dig> could act as a functional co-factor, which cannot be distinguished from mcm <dig> in chip-chip assays and motif scans. similarly, swi <dig> is known to have a regulatory function forming sbf or mbf complexes with swi <dig> or mbp <dig> respectively  <cit> . we found a binding site of swi <dig> overlapping with the binding site of swi <dig> . as before, it may not be possible to differentiate between the binding properties of these two factors. these inspections show that our method correctly predicted tfs which have a regulatory function among the components of the tf complexes, even though the regulatory relationship may be indirect. taken together, this detailed investigation highly supports our prediction of the functional regulatory links between cis <dig> and the three tfs.

discussion
modular organization has been proposed as a fundamental principle in cellular systems and many computational algorithms have been developed to identify such modules. in particular, transcriptional modules have been extensively investigated using genome-wide data sources in yeast. it is practically impossible to verify all regulatory links identified in those modules in a single laboratory. as an attempt to overcome this problem, we developed a simple 3-step method to prioritize regulatory links in modules using three types of data sources . first, we defined putative transcriptional modules based on genome-wide binding data from chip-chip. we then identified coherent modules using gene expression data and functional annotation data. finally, and in contrast to other works, we focused on coherent linker genes which appear in several coherent modules by way of functional intersection. these genes and their regulators from coherent modules resulted in a list of  <dig> regulatory interactions which have a high level of support and serve as reliable candidates for further experimental validation.

our analysis showed that the proposed approach increased the positive predictive value  when compared with two previously published results by bar-joseph et al. and gao et al., at the expense of sensitivity. this should be expected considering the fact that we integrated one additional data source of functional annotation with the two data sources of chip-chip and gene expression which the other two algorithms used for their predictions. one point to make, however, is that while we utilized functional annotation data for the purpose of prediction, they used annotation data for validation of their prediction. note also that because the validation using annotation data involves over-representation or enrichment of genes in sets of genes, it cannot serve for validation of all predicted functional target genes. in addition, while those works utilized gene expression data to derive coherent modules from chip-chip binding data, their published work did not focus on individual regulatory interactions. their predicted interactions are simply all members of statistically predicted modules themselves. in contrast, our predictions do not exclusively aim at modules, but individual regulatory interactions, which we obtained by means of functional intersection. by this prioritization approach we purposefully predicted less functional associations , but doubled ppv with respect to the literature reference . although this validates our approach, it may illustrate a limitation of the literature reference which covers only a fraction of all experimentally verified genes to date. because of this limitation we also compared the different methods with respect to a more comprehensive reference set of predicted regulatory interactions. these predicted interactions are based on updated chip-chip data and sequence conservation across other yeast species. we took them as an indication for functional interactions. using this reference set, we achieved 48% as compared to 25–39% from the two other works. we stress that all methods compared here have their own specific aims and merits although they share the overall goal to derive functional interactions from physical interactions . a conservative strategy to identify functional interactions, would combine the results from multiple algorithms. we provide our results of such analysis in additional file  <dig> 

using the updated chip-chip dataset by harbison et al.  <cit>  also enabled us to compare our approach with a recent algorithm  by lemmens et al.  <cit> . their algorithm is similar in spirit to the gram algorithm but integrates three types of data sources  in a concurrent way. this is different from our sequential approach, but yielded similar prediction accuracy. yet, in terms of predicted regulatory interactions, there was only little overlap with our results, indicating the complementarity of these two methods.

in general, it is difficult to directly compare the performance of different algorithms which are designed for different purposes. our comparison of published results highlights the fact that different approaches have so far been used with different aims and yield different trade-offs between specificities and sensitivities. a more comprehensive evaluation study would require re-running different algorithms in different regions of parameter space. notice though that in this work we did not vary p-value thresholds of chip-chip results to adjust ppv or sensitivity as was done by bar-joseph et al.  <cit> , for instance.

another strategy to improve all methods is to incorporate activity profiles of tfs . experimental data of protein concentrations are currently lacking and using mrna expression profiles of tf-encoding genes is not promising because of weak correlation as we discussed earlier  <cit> . also notice that the computational effort to infer activity profiles of tfs, as attempted by the ma-networker algorithm, did not result in better performance than our simpler approach. here we focus on tf-gene pairs with high expression correlation  only for the purpose of a detailed analysis, but not as part of the systematic study.

specifically, we suggested  <dig> functionally interacting proteins in cell wall formation and a possible feedback regulation of glucose utilization through swi <dig>  we also predicted that the glycoprotein-encoding gene cis <dig> is regulated by three cell-cycle regulators, swi <dig>  ndd <dig> and fkh <dig>  in addition, our detailed analysis revealed that the conserved binding sites of the three factors are located very close to each other. we further identified binding sites of swi <dig> and mcm <dig> which overlap with those of swi <dig> and ndd <dig> respectively, suggesting formation of two complexes, swi6-swi <dig>  and ndd1-fkh2-mcm <dig>  the two complexes may interact with each other through fkh <dig> on the basis of the identified binding sites. on the other hand, a previous study on cell cycle by the young laboratory identified cis <dig> as a target of two cell cycle activators, the sbf complex and fkh <dig>  but not as a target of the ndd1-fkh2-mcm <dig> complex. see table  <dig> in  <cit> . hence, our results suggest a new regulatory link between the ndd1-fkh2-mcm <dig> complex and cis <dig>  it might also be the case that fkh <dig> recruits either the sbf complex or the two other components of the ndd1-fkh2-mcm <dig> complex according to distinct cell-cycle phases.

by the design of functional intersection, our predictions suggest multiple transcription factors for each gene. this could be taken as a sign of combinatorial regulation. we would like to caution, however, that the inference of combinatorial regulation requires further analysis, such as the vicinity of binding sites, as in the example of cis <dig>  or a clear indication that the combination of factors is required for synergistic expression  <cit> . our predicted list of multiple transcription factors did not result from such an analysis since we did not pursue the issue in this work.

CONCLUSIONS
here we proposed a simple method to obtain functional regulatory interactions from physical interactions . to this end, we utilized gene expression and functional annotation data which helped to refine transcriptional modules and identify coherent linker genes for prioritization. we demonstrated that our method is able to increase the fraction of functional interactions with respect to two reference datasets and complementary to other existing methods. finally, we suggested several novel individual interactions for further mechanistic analysis and experimental validation.
