BACKGROUND
as one of the fastest growing diseases in the world, t2d has developed a main public health problem with more than  <dig> million people affected by this disease, and is the major type of diabetes with about 90% patients of all the diabetes patients  <cit> . t2d is characterized by insulin resistance and the decrease of insulin secretion <cit> , and the major complications comprise the abnormally high or low blood glucose caused by diabetes related medications, the heart and blood vessel disease, osteoporosis, skin and mouth problems, and the damage of other organs, including kidneys, eyes, feet, nerves and so on. t2d is also the risk factor for alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. t2d could be diagnosed by detecting the levels of blood glucose, glucose tolerance and hba1c  <cit> .

in the unbiased genome-wide studies on t2d risk genes, the insulin-producing β cells in islets have been considered as the crucial object of researches <cit> . the pancreatic β cells were stimulated to secrete insulin to regulate the homoeostasis of the blood glucose by the postprandial high levels of blood glucose  <cit> . until now, hundreds of genetic variations related with t2d or glucose/insulin have been identified by gwas   <cit> . most t2d risk genes identified in gwas performs the biological processes which affect the number or function of the pancreatic β cells, emphasizing the important effect of β cells in the occurrence and development of t2d  <cit> . currently, the variances of molecular level in human islets have been analyzed systematically by the integration of gwas, cdna chips and the measurement of the response reaction of insulin for glucose and hba1c  <cit> . in another study, a manually created database t2dgadb was built using the genetic association data provided by  <dig> publications of t2d studies, including the data source derived from gwas and meta analysis  <cit> . but these genetic variants could only explain part of the heritability of t2d, so there need for the new methods to identify the t2d susceptibility genes.

most previous studies often investigated the t2d etiology in the field of genetics, but the recent researches found that the environmental and lifestyle factors could also affect the t2d pathogenesis  <cit> , in addition to the genetic influence. and epigenetic variations could establish the links between the environmental exposure and pathological mechanism of t2d  <cit> . epigenetic variations were heritable and reversible, which were considered to play an important role in metabolic diseases. as the major environmental risk factors of t2d, the unhealthy diet causing obesity and sedentary lifestyle might cause the epigenetic changes and even promote the occurrence of t2d <cit> . current studies have shown that dna methylation and histone modifications could change by the metabolic or nutritional disorders and other environmental factors, thereby affecting the development of the pancreatic β cell and the function of insulin secretion to cause the decline of the sensitivity of insulin response, and ultimately lead to the occurrence of t2d. there is also evidence to suggest that the low birth weight is considered as an indicator of fetal malnutrition and associated with impaired glucose tolerance  and t2d later in life <cit> . recently, the genome-wide maps of epigenetic markers have been described in several cell lines of mouse and human, including the human islet tissue. a map of histone modifications for human islet tissue was constructed by chip-seqencing , including the active  and inhibitive  histone modifications, which was considered as the reference to the researches for the t2d etiology  <cit> . these epigenetic findings provide a reliable resource for understanding the crucial roles of the regulatory elements for the human islets in t2d susceptibility.

the statistically significant overlaps between the complex disease pathologies might be caused by the protein variances which are involved in the same pathways or protein complexes, or have the same or similar functions <cit> . the increasing evidences also showed that the proteins, whose corresponding genes contributed to the same disease, often tend to interact with each other sharing the same or similar biological processes and co-expressing in the same tissues <cit> . therefore, the computational systems biology methods based on network theory have been widely used to investigate into the human complex diseases. in the network-based approaches, it is hypothesized that the biological networks consist of the interacting proteins with specific functions  <cit> . the functional interactions could be shown in the interaction level, including physical interaction, co-expression, co-regulation and phenotypic interaction. the functionally related genes usually cluster in the biological networks, and the interactome could explain the complexity of the network linkages. the human interactome has been used to identify the potential disease-causing genes. in a recent research, based on the combination of human interactome and the genome-wide dna methylation, a weighted cancer-related dna methylation network was constructed and a list of potential cancer-related genes with aberrant dna methylation was prioritized <cit> . still, there are few studies about disease network combined the dna methylation and chromatin modifications with the human interactome.

as one of the metabolic diseases affecting the health and normal life, t2d is related with genetic, autoimmune, environmental and other factors. recent studies have shown that the epigenetic factors also contribute to the pathogenesis of t2d, but still unclear currently. in this study, based on the network theory, the two major epigenetic modifications, dna methylation and chromatin modifications were used to construct t2d-related dna methylation network and chromatin modification pattern network, respectively. the interplay modules of both dna methylation and chromatin modifications were detected, and then the genes with epigenetic disorders of t2d were identified. these genes and modules might affect the development of t2d by the epigenetic dysregulation, and could be the biological markers for the t2d etiology.

RESULTS
identification of t2d-related differentially methylated genes
variations in dna methylation with pathology were found in a variety of cancers and other complex diseases, including diabetes and autoimmune diseases. the patterns of genome-wide dna methylation were diverse in different states, representing the characteristics under the certain state. comparing the distributions of dna methylation of t2d and control samples covering  <dig> genes, it is shown that there was a bimodal distribution in the control samples .  <dig> genes accounting for  <dig> % of the total were hypomethylated , and a few genes in the control samples were hypermethylated , including  <dig> genes . figure 1b revealed the dna methylation distribution of t2d islet tissue had only one peak in the hypomethylation region. although dna methylation distribution in t2d state was different from the control state, the majority of genes showed the low dna methylation level with the number of  <dig> genes accounting for  <dig> % of the total, which was similar with the count of control state. but the number of genes with high dna methylation levels was significantly reduced by nearly 1/ <dig>  containing  <dig> genes and only accounting for  <dig> %,

based on the significant differences of genome-wide dna methylation distributions between t2d and control samples, it is suggested the differentially methyalted genes might contribute to the occurrence and development of t2d.  <dig> differentially methylated genes were identified using sam with the fdr value <  <dig> , most of which were hypomethylated and only  <dig> genes were hypermethylated . comparing differentially methylated genes in t2d and control groups , the mean value of differentially methylated genes were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in t2d and control group, respectively. in control group, the differentially methylated genes were mainly in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> , but mainly in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  in t2d group. for the differentially methylated genes in control group, there were  <dig> hypermethylated genes , while only  <dig> genes in t2d group. reversely, for the hypomethylated genes, there were  <dig> genes in control group, much less than the  <dig> genes in t2d group. the results indicated that the dna methylation patterns reflected the global hypomethylation in the genome of t2d islet cells and there was a set of genes with the dna methylation level reduced in t2d might play the crucial role in the development of the t2d pathology.

construction and analysis of t2d-related dna methylation weighted networks
dna methylation in complex disease has become the hot topic of intense investigation. in this study, t2d-related network was constructed by the dna methylation level of genes in genome-wide scale. we hypothesized that dna methylation variances related with t2d may cluster in the complex network, targeting the specific molecular pathways. based on the integrated background network and t2d-related dna methylation data with the genome-wide scale , the weighted methylation ppi network  was built, composing of  <dig> interactions  and  <dig> genes . it includes  <dig> differentially methylated genes .using the subset of  <dig> differentially methylated genes as the seed set, the t2d-related dna methylation weighted subnetwork  was extracted form wmpn  . tmsn contains the seed genes and the genes which connect with the seed genes in wmpn, comprising  <dig> genes  and  <dig> interactions . the largest component of tmsn was comprised of  <dig> interactions and  <dig> genes which contained  <dig> seed genes. it is generally considered that proteins often interacts with each other if owning the similar phenotypes in the complex diseases. thus, tmsn might represent a set of epigenetic-specific dysregulated pathways caused by the aberrant dna methylation, contributing to the epigenetic disorders of t2d.

in the subsequent analysis, the network topological features of wmpn and tmsn were compared . wmpn and tmsn all followed the power-law distribution, with rwmpn= <dig>  and rtmsn= <dig>  . they were called as scale-free networks with the characteristics of a few hub nodes and the majority nodes with low connectivity . as shown in the table  <dig>  the network topological features were calculated. tmsn has the network average degree and clustering coefficient much significant higher than that of wmpn, the degrees of tmsn and wmpn were  <dig>  and  <dig> , and clustering coefficients were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

in order to assess the reliability of tmsn, the global network randomization was performed . the topological features of the  <dig> global random subnetworks were calculated and compared with tmsn. the results showed that tmsn was significantly different from the global random null model, the three topological features were all significant less than the global random null model with the empirical p value of <  <dig>  . the possible reason for this phenomenon might be that the seed set was a collection of genes with the relative low degree in wmpn resulting in the tmsn gene set with low degrees. therefore, comparing the node and edge sizes of tmsn and global random null model, it is found that the sizes of the node set and the edge set for tmsn were less than the sizes of all the  <dig> global random subnetworks. and the average degree of the seed gene set was  <dig> in wmpn, less than all the average degrees of the  <dig> random seed gene sets.

to validate the statistical significance of the network modularity for tmsn, the giant component of tmsn was extracted. the local network randomization was performed and  <dig> local random subnetwork giant components were constructed . the topological features of local random null model were calculated and compared with the giant component of tmsn. the results shown that the clustering coefficient and betweenness of the tmsn giant component were  <dig>  and  <dig>  much higher than the local random null model, indicating the statistically significant differences in the network structures between tmsn and the local random null model .the findings revealed that tmsn might reflect the relationship between t2d-related genes with aberrant dna methylation and disease cause genes.

analysis of the t2d-related differentially methylated genes
some researches on disease networks had indicated that the vast majority of disease-related genes were nonessential and did not tend to encode the hub proteins. they often located in the functional the topological periphery of the complex biological networks  <cit> . based on the hypothesis above, the t2d-related seed gene set was compared with a set of housekeeping genes and a set of cancer genes. the housekeeping genes were derived from cheng et al. <cit> , including  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes were mapped into wmpn. and then,  <dig> random gene sets with the same size of  <dig> were obtained by sampling from the wmpn gene set. the average degree of the housekeeping genes was  <dig> , much higher than all the  <dig> average degrees of the random gene sets . cancer gene set was obtained from the national cancer institute for cancer gene index, including  <dig> genes, and  <dig> genes were remained after mapped into the wmpn gene set. also  <dig> random gene sets with the same size of  <dig> were obtained by sampling from the wmpn gene set. the average degree of the cancer genes was  <dig> , significantly higher than all the  <dig> average degrees of the corresponding random gene sets. the cancer genes were more likely to encode the hubs, and so were the housekeeping genes .

housekeeping genes were defined as the constitutive genes that were required for the maintenance of basic cellular function, and were expressed in all cells of an organism. thus, the functional centrality of housekeeping genes determined the network topological centrality of these genes, performing the crucial functions with the high degrees. studies have shown that cancer-related genes tend to perform the basic cellular functions, named with essential genes. therefore, the cancer gene set also had the functional and topological centrality in complex biological networks and played the critical role in the development of diseases. many researches have shown that t2d is the chronic metabolic disease with the complex pathological mechanism unclear so far. but the causing genes of t2d might be the nonessential genes with the non-critical functions in organisms, so the dysregulation caused by these genes might be the non-fatal disorders. in this study, the average degree of t2d-related differentially methylated genes was only  <dig> , significant less than all the random gene sets, revealing that t2d-related genes had the functional and topological peripherality in tmsn obtained from wmpn was the biological significance.

the pattern of chromatin modifications for t2d
recent studies have shown that dna methylation, histone modifications and other epigenetic modifications often effect together and lead to the common results. histone modifications were considered to play the important roles in the regulation of the gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomal structure. in this study, we examined five chromatin modifications, including h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  ctcf  and dnasehs  in t2d.

the chromatin modification intensities were mapped into the tss proximal regions of genes in the genome-wide scale, and the distribution patterns of chromatin modifications were compared for all the genes and the t2d-related differentially methylated genes . it was found that the intensities of chromatin modifications in t2d-related differentially methylated genes were significantly different from those in genome-wide scale. based on the results above, we further compared the chromatin modifications in t2d-related differentially and non-differentially methylated genes . the results revealed that the chromatin modification intensities in t2d-related differentially methylated genes were much higher than those in non-differentially methylated genes, indicating the specific pattern of chromatin modifications in t2d. there were  <dig> t2d-related differentially methylated genes in all, including  <dig> hypomethylated genes and only  <dig> hypermethylated genes with the count  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total number, respectively. there were  <dig> non-differentially methylated genes, including  <dig> hypomethylated genes and  <dig> hypermethylated genes, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total, respectively. for the differentially and non-differentially methylated gene sets, the count ratios of the hypermethylated genes were approximate, while the count ratio of the hypomethylated genes in differentially methylated gene set was much more than that in non-differentially methylated gene set .

the t2d-specific chromatin modification patterns might result in the aberrance of dna methylation, which affected the expression levels of the corresponding genes or directly affected the interactions of dna histone to regulate the expression levels of the genes. therefore, as same as dna methylation, chromatin modifications also had the important roles in the occurrence and development of t2d. dna methylation and chromatin modifications were combined to investigate the interplay for the epigenetic dysregulation contributing on the development of t2d in the subsequent analysis.

construction and analysis of t2d-related chromatin modification weighted networks
here, the weighted chromatin modification ppi network  was constructed using the integrated background network and t2d-related chromatin modification data, which was composed of  <dig> interactions  and  <dig> genes   . wcpn might represent the t2d-specific relationship of patterns of chromatin modifications between genes.

the findings above revealed that tmsn had the t2d-specific network structure, which might contain a set of epigenetic-specific dysregulated pathways caused by the aberrant dna methylation, contributing to the epigenetic disorders of t2d. furthermore, the chromatin modification patterns of t2d-related differentially methylated genes were significant distinguished from those of non-differentially methylated genes, indicating that the tight correlation between dna methylation and chromatin modifications in t2d. the combination of dna methylation and histone modifications is helpful to the understanding of the epigenetic dysregulation of t2d. therefore, the chromatin modification patterns of the t2d-related differentially methylated genes and their connected genes were investigated. the t2d-related chromatin modification weighted subnetwork  was built, composing of  <dig> interactions  and  <dig> genes , of which  <dig> seed genes were contained  . the giant component of tcsn comprises  <dig> interactions and  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> seed genes inside. tcsn might reflect the chromatin modification patterns for differentially methylated genes and their connected genes in t2d. it provides the theoretical basis for t2d-spicific epigenetic disorders caused by the dna methylation aberrance and the histone modifications, and promotes the further understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms contributing to the occurrence and development of t2d.

next, the network topological features of wcpn and tcsn were compared. and they all approximately followed the power-law distribution, with rwcpn= <dig>  and rtcsn= <dig> , also called as scale-free networks . the network topological features were calculated. as shown in the table  <dig>  the network average degree and clustering coefficient of tcsn were much significant higher than that of wcpn; the degrees of tcsn and wcpn were  <dig>  and  <dig> ; and clustering coefficients were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . but the betweenness of tcsn was  <dig>  higher than that of wcpn with the betweenness value of  <dig>  similar with the topological features of tmsn .

in order to assess the reliability of tcsn, the global network randomization was performed and  <dig> global random subnetworks were constructed . the topological features of the global random subnetworks were calculated and compared with tcsn. the results showed that tcsn was significantly different from the global random null model, and two topological features  were all significant higher than the global random null model with the empirical p value of <  <dig> , while the betweenness of tcsn is less than that of wcpn with the statistic significance. comparing the sizes of tcsn and the global random null model, it is found that the sizes of the node set and edge set for tcsn were  <dig> and  <dig>  larger than those of all the  <dig> global random subnetworks. the results showed that the chromatin modification patterns of t2d-related differentially methylated genes and the associated genes tended to be similar with each other.

to validate the statistical significance of the network modularity observed in tcsn, the giant component of tcsn was extracted. the local network randomization was performed to contribute  <dig> local random subnetwork giant components . the topological features of local random null model were calculated and compared with the giant component of tcsn. the results were found that the clustering coefficient and betweenness of the tcsn giant component were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively , significantly higher than the local random null model, indicating the statistically significant differences in the network structures. it is revealed that tcsn may reflect the similar relations of chromatin modification patterns between t2d-related aberrant dna methylated genes and the connected genes.

detection of interplay modules of dna methylation and chromatin modifications for t2d
tmsn contained  <dig> components, in which the giant component was composed of  <dig> genes and  <dig> interactions, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total, respectively. for the giant component of tmsn,  <dig> dna methylation specific modules were detected by removing the modules only containing  <dig> elements . tcsn contained  <dig> components, and the giant component was composed of  <dig> genes and  <dig> interactions, almost containing all of the genes and interactions in tcsn with the proportions of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. it was indicated that the chromatin modification patterns of t2d-related differentially methylated genes and their connecting genes were high similar. finally, after removing the modules under the threshold,  <dig> chromatin modification specific modules of t2d were detected from the giant component of tcsn . the dysregulation of biological processes in organisms were often resulted by the combined effects of dna methylation and chromatin modifications. the results above showed that the chromatin modification intensities of t2d-related differentially methylated genes were significant higher than those of non-differentially methylated genes, indicating the t2d-specific chromatin modification patterns.

thus, as the important epigenetic modifications, dna methylation and chromatin modifications contributed to the epigenetic disorders of t2d together. in the  <dig> t2d-related dna methylation modules and  <dig> t2d-related chromatin modification modules, the interplay modules of dna methylation and chromatin modifications for t2d were detected by the cumulative hypergeometric test method . of the two groups of modules, there were  <dig> overlaps, and the minimal overlap only contained one gene, while the maximum overlap contained  <dig> genes. the module combinations  with the smallest overlap size of  <dig> were remained, and after the bonferroni multiple testing correction ,  <dig> significantly enriched sub-modules were identified and considered as the interplay modules of dna methylation and chromatin modifications .

due to the absence of a gold standard to evaluate whether the identified interplay modules were related to t2d, we used the public database pubmed as the reference list  <cit> . for the  <dig> interplay modules, there were  <dig> genes in all. the automated texting of literature for the relationship of the interplay module genes and t2d was by the query terms that contained these genes and type  <dig> diabetes /insulin for the co-occurrence either in an abstract or in the title of previous publications. the results showed that  <dig> genes were related to t2d or insulin with  <dig> publications . and these genes were involved in the almost interplay modules, of which only  <dig> interplay modules had no publication support for their member genes . there may exist the false positive relations for the text-mining of pubmed, because the co-occurrence of the two terms donot mean the gene is indeed related with t2d or insulin. and also, the two terms may be the negative relations for the co-occurrence. because of the positive and negative relations both existing in the titles and abstracts, the deviation could be ignore. so, the results could reflect the relationship between the genes and t2d.

these interplay modules might contribute to the epigenetic disorders of t2d through the combined effects of dna methylation and chromatin modifications. also, t2d-spicific chromatin modification patterns might lead to the aberrance of dna methylation levels and further affect to the expression levels of the corresponding genes, or directly affect the binding of dna and histone to regulate the expression levels of genes. on the other hand, the aberrant dna methylation could directly affect the expression without the cooperation of chromatin modifications. in the following analysis, the effects of dna methylation and chromatin modifications on gene expression were investigated.

the analysis of the effects of dna methylation and chromatin modifications to the expression of genes
firstly, we investigated into the relationship between dna methylation and expression for the corresponding genes. a set of expression data for t2d and control states was derived from jalal taneera et al.. <dig> upregulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes were identified. then, the differentially expressed genes were mapped into the differentially methylated genes, and a subset of  <dig> genes which both differentially expressed and methylated was extracted. in tmsn gene set, there were  <dig> differentially expressed genes were included . many current researches suggested that dna methylation was negatively correlated with gene expression and even affected the expression levels of corresponding genes. in this study, the spearman correlation between dna methylation and the expression of the corresponding gene was calculated, and the correlation coefficient was - <dig>  , consistent with the previous studies. the linear regression model of dna methylation and gene expression was built, and the 95% prediction interval was remained. it is considered that the genes expression levels within this threshold were affected by the genes dna methylation levels  .  <dig> genes had both the dna methylation and expression levels, of which  <dig> genes were above the threshold of the 95% prediction interval, indicating that the expression levels of these genes might be regulated by the dna methylation of the corresponding gene.

in the next analysis, the interplay modules of dna methylation and chromatin modifications for the expression levels of the corresponding genes were investigated. module  <dig> in tmsn contains three genes including two hypomethylated genes, and module  <dig> in tcsn contains seven hypomethylated genes within all  <dig> genes. the overlap of the two modules contained  <dig> genes, and was identified as the interplay module in which the genes were significantly enriched with the cumulative hypergeometric test p value less than  <dig>   . tuba1c , is an encoding gene of tubulin family, which is the major component of microtubules. it is as a skeleton to determine the cell morphology, and with the moter proteins together, provide a scaffold to organelles and vesicles for the movement . this gene was both differentially methylated and expressed in the comparison of the t2d and control samples. and in the analysis of correlation between dna methylation and expression, the expression level of tuba1c might be affected by the dna methylation level. although, so far there has been no reports about the relationship between the gene tuba1c and insulin secretion, a study on the insulin secretion in mouse showed that a microtubule associated protein, syntabulin, which was the necessary protein for the glucose stress and insulin secretion protected by camp. therefore, it is considered that the microtubule encoding protein of human islet tissue tuba1c might be related with the insulin secretion  <cit> . another gene gapdh, connected with a differentially methyalted gene, although the dna methylation level of this gene was not aberrant, researches have shown that, this gene could change the etinal müller cells fate in diabetes <cit> , and müiler cells are the most important retinal glial cells of vertebrate <cit> . it is shown that h3k4me <dig> was negatively correlated with dna methylation. the chromatin modification pattern of gapdh was significantly correlated with that of the two connected differentially methylated genes, but the modification intensities of dnasehs and h3k4me <dig> were higher than the two differentially methylated genes. the dna methylation levels of gapdh in t2d and control samples were both low, and were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, which might be associated with the high intensities of dnasehs and h3k4me <dig> 

next, another interplay module was investigated. module  <dig> in tmsn giant component contains six genes, of which there was one differentially methylated gene with no variance of the expression level. module <dig> in tcsn giant component contains five genes, and the differentially methylated gene within the module <dig> of tmsn was included. the overlap of the two modules was four genes with the statistical significance of the p value less than  <dig> , considered as the interplay module of dna methylation and chromatin modifications . chmp1a is the differentially methylated gene in the interplay module of dna methylation and chromatin modifications, and the dna methylation pattern of this gene was all negatively correlated with that of the connected genes. the findings revealed the specific dna methylation pattern different from other genes, indicating that the aberrant dna methylation pattern of chmp1a might result in the disorders of epigenetic modules in t2d. and the gene, atp6v1b <dig>  connecting with chmp1a, was reported a potential factor contributing to the development of t2d  <cit> . next, another connected gene atp6v1h which was not included in the interplay module, showed a decreasing trend of expression level in t2d, considering that the variance of expression level might be resulted by the aberrant chromatin modifications. in summary, in this study, a set of interplay modules of dna methylation and chromatin modifications was detected, and might play the extremely important roles in the development of t2d.

discussion
in this study, based on the network theory, the t2d-related dna methylation and chromatin modification networks were constructed by the integrated epigenetic data and protein interactome, and the two networks showed the specific topological features. the t2d-related dna methylation and chromatin modification modules were detected and the interplay modules of the two epigenetic modifications with the statistical significance were identified as the epigenetic markers for t2d. the interplay modules might lead to the epigenetic disorders by the aberrance of dna methylation and chromatin modifications, and affect the development of t2d. it is helpful for the understanding of the etiological mechanism caused by epigenetic disorders and the treatment for t2d.

here, the dna methylation data was examined by human methylation 27k beadchip using bisulfite conversion technology. the genome-wide dna methylation chips with bisulfite conversion technology could provide the accurately quantified at single-base resolution level, more than  <dig> cpg sites could be interrogated by human methylation 27k beadchip, but only  <dig> genes with the promoter-specific regions were covered. and in this study, the chromatin modifications could be mapped into the tss proximal regions of  <dig> human entrez genes, of which only  <dig> genes had both the dna methylation and chromatin modifications data, approximately  <dig> genes lacked the dna methylation data. but the t2d-related dna methylation data of human islet tissue we obtained from geo were only detected by human methylation 27k beadchip, and the coverage of dna methylation is the limitation for this study.

we extracted the t2d-related differentially methylated subnetwork from wmpn, which representing the physical and pathway interactions between the t2d-related differentially methylated genes and the connected genes. this subnetwork showed the t2d specific dna methylation patterns between genes. in the analysis of the network topological features, it is found that the topological features of tmsn were all less than the global random null model with the statistic significance. one reason for this phenomenon is speculated that the most t2d-related differentially methylated genes had the low degrees, and leaded to the size of the tmsn extracted by these genes less than the permutations. considering that t2d is the non-fatal chronic metabolic disorder, tmsn might show this biological significance. the genes contributing to the occurrence and development of t2d might be a set of the nonessential genes involved in the biological processes, so the dysregulation of these genes leaded to the non-fatal disorder, t2d. similarly, the non-essentiality of these genes with the biological functions determined the peripherality of function and topology in the biological network. to validate this hypothesis, housekeeping genes and cancer genes were used to compare with the t2d-related differentially methylated genes. the average degrees of the three gene sets in wmpn were calculated, the results showed that the average degrees of housekeeping genes and cancer genes were significantly higher than that of the wmpn gene set and the corresponding random gene sets, while the average degree of t2d-related differentially methylated genes was less than that of the wmpn gene set and the corresponding random gene set. therefore, tmsn constructed by the t2d-related differentially methylated genes showed the t2d specific network characteristics.

the current studies showed that the biological events often caused by the combination of dna methylation and chromatin modifications. therefore, the epigenetic disorders of t2d were caused by both dna methylation and chromatin modifications. in this study,  <dig> interplay modules of dna methylation and chromatin modifications were identified by the cumulative hypergeometric test with the statistic significance , considered as the epigenetic disordered modules of t2d by the interplay between dna methylation and chromatin modifications. in the analysis with the combination of the t2d expression level for human islet tissue, it is found that there existing the aberrant expressed genes caused by the abnormal dna methylation and chromatin modifications. it is shown that dna methylation was inversely corrected with the expression of the corresponding gene in the linear regression model. but the spearman correlation coefficient was only - <dig> , seemed weakly. only part of the genes has shown the negative correlations between dna methylation and expression of the corresponding gene. this phenomenon could be partly explained by the reason that the probes could not cover all the promoters in the genome-wide scale in human methylation 27k beadchip <cit> . each promoter could cover  <dig>  cpg sites, but the gene might have several promoters. while the probes in expression chips usually could be positioned in the common exons of the all transcripts for the corresponding gene. therefore, the promoters that located by cpg sites were not must be the corresponding promoter of the transcript. so only a part of genes showed the negatively correlations between dna methylation and expression of the corresponding gene. it is inconvenient for the analysis of the correction of dna methylation and expression.

CONCLUSIONS
t2d is one of the most common chronic metabolic diseases, and related with genetic, autoimmune and environmental factors. epigenetics could establish the interface between environmental factor and the t2d pathology mechanism. in this study, it is considered that the biological events were affected by both dna methylation and chromatin modifications through tmsn and wcpn. the analysis of expression levels of human islet tissue for t2d showed that the variances of expression levels of the genes were caused by the aberrant dna methylation and the intensities of chromatin modifications. thus, t2d epigenetic networks provide a new way for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of t2d caused by epigenetic disorders.
