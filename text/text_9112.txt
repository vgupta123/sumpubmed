BACKGROUND
foxe <dig> is a member of the large and evolutionarily ancient family of forkhead domain-containing transcriptional regulators, which are involved in a variety of developmental and physiological processes in organisms from yeast to mammals  <cit> . foxe <dig>  previously termed thyroid transcription factor- <dig>   was originally isolated by screening a rat cdna library  <cit> . the foxe <dig> protein was shown to bind specifically to the thyroglobulin promoter and function as a transcriptional repressor  <cit> . during mouse embryogenesis foxe <dig> is expressed in developing thyroid, rathke's pouch, palate, tongue, epiglottis, pharynx, and oesophagus and in the epithelium of the pharyngeal wall and arches  <cit> . foxe <dig> transcripts are also found in the hair follicle and are regulated by sonic hedgehog signaling in the human and mouse  <cit> . consistent with its expression pattern, foxe1-null mutant mice exhibit either a sublingual or completely absent thyroid gland, cleft palate and abnormal hair structure and growth  <cit> . similarly, mutations in the forkhead dna-binding domain of the human foxe <dig> gene cause thyroid agenesis, cleft palate and choanal atresia similar to the phenotype observed in foxe1-null mutant mice  <cit> . taken together, the crucial role of foxe <dig> in thyroid formation, palate, and hair development is well established in placental mammals.

expression of foxe <dig> orthologs in other vertebrates is similar to their mammalian counterparts. for example, in the xenopus embryo, foxe <dig> is expressed in the developing thyroid, pituitary mesoderm of brachial arches and the pharyngeal endoderm  <cit> . in the zebrafish embryo foxe <dig> is expressed in the thyroid, pharynx, and pharyngeal skeleton  <cit> . in addition, the gene is strongly expressed in the gill and weakly expressed in the brain, eye, and heart in adult zebrafish. however, in contrast to the role of foxe <dig> in placental mammals, a loss-of-function study demonstrated that zebrafish foxe <dig> is not required for the thyroid formation but is necessary for chondrogenesis during pharyngeal skeleton formation  <cit> . these data suggest that foxe <dig> may have acquired the role in the regulation of thyroid development during the evolution of tetrapods, or may have lost this role in the fish lineage. on the other hand, foxe <dig> is involved in the regulation of hair morphogenesis, which is a relatively recent skin organ, appearing in the mammalian lineage  <cit> . this suggests that foxe <dig> has acquired a novel regulatory function in the mammalian lineage. taken together, the data supports substantial functional evolution of foxe <dig> during vertebrate evolution.

despite progress in understanding the function of the mammalian, amphibian and fish foxe <dig> genes, nothing is known about foxe <dig> gene in birds. the study of foxe <dig> of birds can help fill the missing link and provide important insights into the evolution of this gene in vertebrates. here, we have identified foxe <dig> genes in multiple avian species and characterized its expression pattern during chicken development using in situ hybridization. our data shows that chicken foxe <dig> expression is limited to developing thyroid and feathers. we also observe a significant sequence divergence of the n- and c- terminus of the avian foxe <dig> proteins and a loss of two repressive domains. our codon analysis  of avian foxe <dig> genes suggests that relaxed purifying selection, or alternatively, positive selection in a subset of residues, might have driven sequence divergence of the avian foxe <dig> c-terminus.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of foxe <dig> genes of chicken, zebra finch, and turkey
chicken foxe <dig> is currently listed in the ensembl database as ensgalg <dig> located at chromosome 8:  <dig> ,482- <dig> , <dig>  although foxe <dig> genes in other species are listed as orthologs for this gene, the lack of synteny with other foxe <dig> genes indicates that this region is not homologous to foxe <dig> but with foxe <dig> . a true homolog  of foxe <dig> has not been previously reported in the chicken. we searched for the foxe <dig> gene in the chicken genome database using a mouse foxe <dig> gene as the query sequence in the blast search. a genomic region of the highest homology to the query sequence was found on the chicken bac clone ch261-25p <dig>  representing a part of the sex-determining z chromosome. the expression of the chicken foxe <dig> gene was confirmed with rt-pcr using a chicken embryonic cdna library . analysis of the region of homology revealed an uninterrupted orf of  <dig> bps, encoding a  <dig> aa protein sequence with a molecular weight of  <dig> da . the deduced protein sequence shows the highest similarity to the foxe <dig> forkhead domain  with ~88% identity, whereas the c-terminus outside the forkhead domain shows a much reduced similarity . the c-terminus of the chicken foxe <dig> protein is shorter  than those of orthologous foxe <dig> proteins. moreover, the n-terminal  <dig> aa of chicken foxe <dig> has no significant similarity to the n-terminal domains of other foxe <dig> proteins. the chicken foxe <dig> gene is extremely gc-rich , and the highest gc-content is in the 3'-region of the gene, encoding the c-terminus  . the syntenic arrangement of surrounding genes confirmed that this was foxe <dig> . thus, we identified the chicken foxe <dig> gene consisting of a single exon similar to orthologous genes.

we further searched for the presence of a zebra finch foxe <dig> using a chicken foxe <dig> gene as the query against the genomic dataset of zebra finch. the blast search identified a genomic region of  <dig> bps on the minus strand of z chromosome with the coordinates 31552116- <dig> bps,  exhibiting 88% similarity to the chicken foxe <dig> nucleotide sequence. an orf was identified in this chromosomal region , and the corresponding protein sequence exhibited the highest homology to foxe <dig> proteins. thus, this similarity clearly indicated that the indentified region is a zebra finch ortholog of chicken foxe <dig> . however, the zebra finch genomic sequence lacked a 5' - part, encoding an entire n-terminus and a 5' - portion of the forkhead domain because of a gap in the sequence of the z chromosome. nevertheless, the region represents a major portion of the gene, encoding a portion of the forkhead domain and an entire c-terminus.

to better characterize foxe <dig> in avian lineages, we further searched for foxe <dig> gene in the reference genome of turkey. however, despite the recent sequencing of the turkey genome, the foxe <dig> gene sequence was not identified. upon closer inspection, we concluded that the corresponding genomic region is missing from the turkey reference genome. therefore, we identified the foxe <dig> gene from turkey by direct genomic pcr amplification and sequencing. remarkably, the putative turkey foxe <dig> gene exhibited 97% identity to the chicken gene, which is consistent with the reported high similarity of chicken and turkey genomes  <cit> .

interestingly, avian foxe <dig> genes in both chicken and zebra finch are located on the sex-determining z chromosome, which is distinct from the chromosomal location of vertebrate orthologs. fish and mammalian foxe <dig> are located on autosomal chromosomes . this difference in localization indicates two possibilities: the avian foxe <dig> was either part of the ancestral autosomal chromosome which has evolved into the z chromosome in an ancestral amniote  <cit> , or foxe <dig> genomic locus was translocated onto the z chromosome. synteny between the chicken chromosome z and human chromosome  <dig>  which includes the sex determining dmrt <dig>  indicates that the chromosome z evolved from the autosomal chromosome  <cit> . human foxe <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  therefore, a distinctive chromosomal localization of avian foxe <dig> in birds is likely associated with the ancestral autosomal chromosome that subsequently evolved into the z chromosome.

in summary, by synteny-based analysis of orthology in chicken, and by direct sequencing in turkey, we have identified the avian orthologs of mammalian foxe <dig> gene, at least two of which are localized on the sex-determining z chromosome.

expression of chicken foxe <dig> gene is restricted to the developing thyroid and feathers
to determine the expression pattern of foxe <dig> during chicken embryogenesis, whole mount in situ hybridization was performed on chicken embryos spanning embryonic stages 3- <dig>  <cit>  with a  <dig> bps antisense probe for foxe <dig>  expression of foxe <dig> was observed at but not before stage  <dig>  and was restricted to the primordial thyroid placode . at this stage the thyroid placode is forming by anterior bending of the pharynx floor, and is characterized by a low proliferative index  <cit> . foxe <dig> expression is clearly visible when the placode is discernible . at stage  <dig>  the thyroid primordium is in an advanced stage of evagination, and expression of foxe <dig> was more pronounced in the indentations rather than in the shoulders of the evagination . at stage  <dig>  expression of foxe <dig> was restricted to the anterior pharynx at the level of the second pharyngeal arch . by stage  <dig>  the thyroid develops into a vesicle  <cit> . foxe <dig> expression is maintained in the forming vesicle during budding off of the gland from the pharynx. foxe <dig> expression is maintained at stage  <dig>  when the thyroid separates from the pharynx and exhibits a dramatic change in shape that marks the beginning of bilobation  <cit> . at stage  <dig>  the thyroid is invaded by vascular and connective tissues and strong expression of foxe <dig> was observed throughout the follicle primordium . this suggests that foxe <dig> may be involved in the maturation of the gland as well. we confirmed this tissue as the developing thyroid using the transcription factor gene hhex, which is expressed in the developing thyroid . hhex, is important for proliferation of thyroid cell precursors and for thyroid morphogenesis  <cit> . in situ hybridization showed that expression domains of foxe <dig> and hhex are similar, clearly marking the developing thyroid. although no expression of foxe <dig> was detected in feather buds at stages 30- <dig>  foxe <dig> is expressed in distal growing feathers by hh stage  <dig> . interestingly, no chicken foxe <dig> expression was observed in the developing pituitary or, palate, as has been reported for amphibian and murine foxe <dig> genes, respectively. in conclusion, in situ hybridization analysis shows that chicken foxe <dig> is a thyroid and feather-specific transcription factor, and suggests a possible role for foxe <dig> in the evagination, and morphogenesis of the thyroid and feathers.

evolution of the avian foxe <dig> proteins: a loss of a repressive domain and the eh <dig> motif
to investigate the basis for the size reduction and sequence divergence of the avian foxe <dig> proteins relative to mammalian and amphibian counterparts, we constructed a multiple sequence alignment of all foxe <dig> genes. the sequence alignment revealed two deletions at the c-terminus: a first deletion corresponding to  <dig> aa and a second deletion corresponding to  <dig> aa protein region . the first deletion resulted in an avian-specific loss of a  <dig> aa aromatic domain , which previously was shown to exhibit transcriptional repression activity in cell culture  <cit> . the second deletion led to the loss of sequences encoding almost the entire eh <dig> motif and adjacent sequences except for a conserved phenylalanine residue, which is preserved in avian proteins. the eh <dig> motif is a conserved eight amino acid sequence fsinl, which is present in a majority of foxe <dig> proteins of fish, amphibians and non-placental mammals  <cit> . similarly, the loss of the eh <dig> motif is observed in foxe <dig> of placental mammals  . the eh <dig> motif is known to mediate physical interactions of fox proteins with the groucho/tle co-repressors  <cit> .

additionally, a novel feature in the avian foxe <dig> proteins is the presence of an n-terminal polyalanine repeat , varying from five to nine alanine residues. the polyalanine repeat is also found in foxe <dig> of mammals where it is distal to the forkhead domain, but is absent in foxe <dig> proteins of amphibians and fish. this suggests that the avian polyalanine repeat arose independently in the avian lineage. the c-terminus of the chicken foxe <dig> protein is also enriched with alanine, glycine, and proline residues , as well as short tandem repeats of proline and alanine . proline and alanine-enriched domains are commonly found in transcriptional repressors  <cit> . this suggests that the avian foxe <dig> protein may function as a transcriptional repressor. thus, while there appears to be an avian-specific loss of two repressive domains in foxe <dig> as a result of deletions, we also found an avian specific gain in proline-alanine repeats, which can potentially confer transcriptional repressive activity to avian foxe <dig> 

analysis of codon evolution in the avian lineage of foxe1
next we investigated whether, consistent with a functional divergence, foxe <dig> has experienced accelerated evolution  specifically in bird ancestry and specific bird lineages using codeml  <cit> . multiple sequence alignment was constructed using three bird and seven other tetrapod foxe <dig> sequences encoding a portion of the forkhead domain and an entire c-terminus, where most of the sequence divergence in the available sequence is concentrated. we first compared two models of evolution using a likelihood ratio test   <cit> . in model- <dig>  all lineages were assumed to have the same evolutionary rate ω <dig>  in the gene phylogeny ; the most likely estimate of ω <dig> in this case was  <dig> . according to model- <dig> , the bird lineages and their ancestral lineage  evolved at a rate of ω <dig> while all other lineages evolved at rate ω <dig>  the estimates of ω <dig> and ω <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, corresponding to a  <dig> -fold increase in the evolutionary rate in the bird lineage. model- <dig> had a significantly better fit to the data than model- <dig> . in model- <dig>  we assumed that the common ancestor of galliformes , and turkey and chicken were evolving at rate ω <dig> and the common ancestor of the avian species and zebra finch were evolving at ω <dig>  while all other lineages evolved with rate ω <dig>  comparing this model with the first model yielded a p-value =  <dig> , with ω <dig> =  <dig> , ω <dig> =  <dig> , and ω <dig> =  <dig> . in model- <dig> , we assumed ω <dig> for the zebra finch branch and ω <dig> for the four branches - common ancestor of all birds and the three galliformes branches. comparing this model with the first model resulted in a p-value =  <dig> , with ω <dig> =  <dig> , ω <dig> =  <dig> , and ω <dig> =  <dig>  corresponding to a  <dig> -fold increase in the evolutionary rate in the zebra finch lineage. these results indicate that there is overall evidence of accelerated evolution in avian foxe <dig>  thus, we conclude that foxe <dig> is likely to have evolved either under relaxed purifying selection or restricted positive selection in a few specific residues in the avian lineage. placental foxe <dig> genes, which also lost the eh <dig> motif, were tested for evolutionary rate by assigning ω <dig> to the placental branch, which resulted in ω <dig> =  <dig>  and ω <dig> =  <dig> . thus, no increase of the evolutionary rate in foxe <dig> of placental mammals is observed in our dataset. this suggests that overall, avian foxe <dig> has experienced either relaxed purifying selection or positive selection on a few specific residues.

as an alternative analysis, we also estimated the average dn/ds profile in the sliding window analysis across foxe <dig> sequences of three pairs of species groups - birds and mammals, birds and amphibians, and, mammals and amphibians . a low dn/ds ratio is estimated for the forkhead domain in all groups, which is indicative of a strong purifying selection. in contrast, the dn/ds profile shows a large variation in the c-terminal region of foxe <dig>  nonsynonymous substitutions were predominantly concentrated within the c-terminus of foxe <dig>  in the two groups that included the birds, dn/ds is much more pronounced when compared to the amphibian and mammal groups.

next, we applied the branch-site model to estimate the fraction of codons that are likely to have evolved under positive selection specifically in the five avian branches using the beb procedure implemented in paml. we used the five avian branches as the foreground and the other branches as background. the test compares two models:  no change in selection was observed in the foreground branches compared to the background branches, and  a certain proportion of sites went from being under negative or no selection in the background branches to being under positive selection in the foreground branch. the lrt test statistic  of the second model relative to the first model was  <dig>  , indicating that a certain fraction of sites did undergo positive selection specifically in the avian lineages. based on the bayesian posterior probabilities  of site class, this analysis detected nineteen sites with beb ≥  <dig> . of those, six sites were selected in the branch leading to galliformes; however, the beb values for these were less than  <dig> . two of the sites, 196q and 203l, were detected to be adaptively evolving in bird lineages with probability >  <dig> . there were seven additional sites with beb ≥  <dig> , which are 134r , 162a , 164r , 173p , 175p , 211p  and 249r . the amino acid coordinates are provided relative to the chicken foxe <dig> protein. these results indicate a change in selective pressure on specific amino acids on the branch leading to birds.

a single positively selected site, 134r, was identified within a forkhead dna-binding domain, which resulted in the non-synonymous substitution of arg to glu. the rest of the positively selected residues were identified in the c-termius, which is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions. it is known that the trans-regulatory domains of transcriptional factors are comprised of short co-factor interaction motifs. by adapting a blast search for short sequences, we searched for short c-terminal segments of chicken foxe <dig>  consisting of  <dig> residues with the positively selected sites. we found that segment 195- <dig> aa of the chicken foxe <dig> protein exhibited a high similarity to the n-terminal region of the homeobox-related transcriptional factor hoxa <dig> . the hit between foxe <dig> and hoxa <dig> had the highest score of ~ <dig> bits. this sequence contains two adaptively evolving sites, 196q and 203l, with the highest posterior probability, and 199s with beb =  <dig> . based on the highest scores and number of hits, the match is likely to be associated with transcriptional function. interestingly, the majority of hoxa <dig> proteins that exhibited the match were from tetrapods; catfish hoxa <dig> was detected but with a lower log-odds score. the region of similarity in hoxa <dig> proteins is located in the n-terminal domain outside of the homeodomain. therefore, it may be potentially associated with activation or protein interaction function. another short segment, 209- <dig> aa matched short proline enriched sequences in homeobox proteins hoxb <dig> and hoxa <dig> in the blast search with a score of  <dig> bits . this sequence contains a positive selected site, 211p with a beb =  <dig> . this short sequence is also enriched with proline and alanine residues, which are commonly found in minimal repression domains  <cit> . it is possible that this sequence can exhibit repressive activity and an increase of the proline residues can enhance repressive activity. the consensus of both sequences is shown on figure 6c. in hoxb <dig> this sequence is located in the n-terminus outside of the homeodomain. the search of hits to other segments of avian foxe <dig> proteins with the selected sites did not retrieve any significant matches to other transcriptional factors. thus, we were able to identify two potentially functional sequences in avian foxe <dig> proteins containing four positively selected sites.

discussion
in this study we report on the identification of the foxe <dig> gene of three bird species and the characterization of foxe <dig> expression pattern during chicken embryogenesis. both foxe <dig> of chicken and zebra finch are distinctively localized on the sex-determining z chromosome, in contrast to placental and marsupial foxe <dig> genes which are localized on autosomes. in situ hybridization shows that the expression of the chicken foxe <dig> gene is restricted to the developing thyroid and feathers. its thyroid expression is initiated at the stage of placode formation when the thyroid cells evaginate from the pharyngeal floor and migrate, and is also maintained during the stage of thyroid maturation. the process of evagination is characterized by tissue remodeling, which includes modulation of cell adhesiveness and cell mobility. based on the pattern of foxe <dig> expression, we propose that the transcription factor foxe <dig> may regulate evagination of thyroid primordia by regulating specific genes required for cell motility and adhesiveness. this observation is supported by previous loss- and gain-of-function studies in the mouse and cell culture, respectively. for example, in foxe1-null mice the secondary palate remains opened  <cit> , which indicates inability of the palate shelves to adhere in the mutant mice  <cit> . forced expression of mammalian foxe <dig> in cell culture resulted in significantly increased expression of an actin-binding protein, tropomyosin isoform  <dig>  and lower expression of integrin beta- <dig> and collagen type xi alpha- <dig>  <cit> . tropomyosin has been shown to be important for regulating the actin mechanics in the cell cytoskeleton, and can mediate changes in cell morphology, adhesion and migration  <cit> . similarly, integrin beta- <dig> has been shown to mediate cell migration  <cit> . moreover, it has been recently shown that human foxe <dig> directly regulates the signaling molecule tgf-3β  <cit> , which in turn, is involved in regulation of cellular adhesion and extracellular matrix  <cit> . thus, foxe <dig> may be involved in regulation of a set of genes and signaling pathways that are required for controlling cell adhesiveness and motility during migration and morphogenesis of thyroid cells. in the future, it will be important to determine whether chicken foxe <dig> directly regulates a similar set of genes during the migration and morphogenesis of the thyroid gland. we also detected expression of foxe <dig> in the growing feather, which suggests the acquisition of a novel expression domain by foxe <dig> in the bird ancestry; since the feather is a bird specific integumentary appendage.

two striking features are found in the sequence of avian foxe <dig> proteins, which are the sequence divergence of the c-terminus and the loss of two functional domains: a c-terminal aromatic domain and the eh <dig> motif as a consequence of two microdeletions. both domains appear to be involved in mediating transcriptional repression. the aromatic domain of the mammalian foxe <dig> protein can inhibit transcription in cell culture when fused to a heterologous dna-binding domain, thus acting as a transferable repression domain  <cit> . nothing is known about direct targets of this repression domain. interestingly, mammalian foxe <dig> represses transcriptional activation mediated by pax <dig> in cell culture, which suggests that it may directly interact with transcription factor pax <dig>  possibly via this repression domain  <cit> . we noted that the avian genomes lack transcription factor pax <dig> , which is important for thyroid formation in mammals  <cit> . this is consistent with an extensive loss of genes in the chicken genome  <cit> . thus, it would be interesting to determine whether the loss of the aromatic repressive domain was associated with the loss of the pax <dig> locus in birds.

the eh <dig> motif is a conserved amino acid sequence  <cit> , known to mediate physical interaction of other fox proteins with groucho/tle co-repressors. foxg <dig>  slp <dig> , foxd <dig> and foxh <dig> have been shown to interact physically with groucho/tle co-repressors via the eh <dig> motif . strikingly, the eh <dig> motif is conserved in all foxe <dig> of fish, amphibians, and non-placental mammals, but it was lost in those of birds. interestingly, a loss of the eh <dig> motif is also observed in foxe <dig> of placental mammals as an outcome of a microdeletion . the loss of the eh <dig> motif in the avian foxe <dig> protein is likely to lead to the loss of groucho/tle recruiting activity mediated by the eh <dig> motif, and the loss of specific repressive activity dependent on the aromatic domain. even though the functional implication of both domain losses in avian foxe <dig> proteins is not clear, it is likely to affect transcriptional function. it is intriguing that the loss of two putative repressive domains is accompanied by a gain of an n-terminal polyalanine repeat. the avian foxe <dig> domain losses may be associated with either functional divergence, loss of co-factor interacting proteins, or even reduction of expression domain. in situ hybridization in the chicken embryo shows that expression of foxe <dig> is restricted to the developing thyroid and feathers, and no expression was observed in other internal embryonic tissues. foxe <dig> orthologs have additional domain expressions other than in developing thyroid. for instance, frog foxe <dig> is expressed both in the developing thyroid and pituitary  <cit> . foxe <dig> of zebrafish is expressed in pharyngeal skeleton, gills and thyroid  <cit> . it is certainly possible that the reduction of expression of foxe <dig> in birds has resulted in the loss of these functional sequences. similarly, a loss of the eh <dig> motif in foxe <dig> of placental mammals can possibly be associated with a novel functional requirement.

to investigate the role of selection in the evolution of foxe <dig> coding regions in the avian lineages, we used various models of codon evolution dn/ds . overall, dn/ds  of foxe <dig> was estimated to be less than  <dig>  which suggested that foxe <dig> were evolving under purifying selection. significant increase of the dn/ds ratio was estimated between the branches of avian foxe <dig> and those of mammals and amphibians, which is indicative of a change in the selection and of the acceleration of evolution of avian 3'foxe <dig>  the increase of the dn/ds ratio can be a result of either a relaxation of purifying selection or positive selection in specific sites of the c-terminal domain of foxe <dig> in the avian lineage. in paralogous regulatory genes, the relaxation of purifying selection was proposed to be a result of paralogous proteins binding to a subset of interacting proteins relative to the ancestral gene copy  <cit> . by this analogy, relaxation of purifying selection in avian foxe <dig> could be a result of loss of ancestral protein interactions and possibly formation of interaction with novel binding proteins. overall, the c-terminal domain is subjected to fewer functional constraints when compared to the dna-binding forkhead domain. an increased evolutionary rate of c-terminal regions can be attributed to the capacity of trans-regulatory domains to interact with co-factors and the transcriptional machinery via short interaction motifs. in turn, interaction peptide motifs can evolve quickly due to short size and low affinity of interaction with co-factors  <cit> .

our branch-site model identified eighteen c-terminus residues under positive selection in the avian lineage, and two residues, 196q and 203l, had the highest posterior probability, suggestive of adaptive evolution. only a single adaptively evolving residue, 134r, was identified in the forkhead dna-binding domain, which resulted in a non-synonymous substitution in the avian lineage, whereas all other residues lie in the c-terminus. interestingly, the 196q and 203l residues are located in a segment  of avian foxe <dig> proteins. this segment shows a strong homology to n-terminal short sequences of the homeobox hoxa <dig> proteins. the n-terminal portion of the hoxa <dig> protein contains a trans-regulatory domain, which is likely involved in regulation of transcription. mouse hoxa <dig> has been shown to function as a negative regulator  <cit> . moreover, hoxa <dig> can inhibit smad-mediated activation of transcription by binding directly to smad co-factors via the n-terminus  <cit> . however, refined mapping of smad-interacting sequences have not been conducted. it is likely that the region  is involved in regulation of transcription based on high homology to the n-terminal segment of homeodomain-containing hoxa <dig> protein, and adaptively evolving residues may have contributed to avian specific foxe <dig> function.

a residue 211p under positive selection was found in the foxe <dig> segment  enriched with proline and alanine residues. this segment shares a high similarity with n-terminal sequences of hoxb <dig> and hoxa <dig> proteins of mammals, which are also enriched with proline and alanine residues. interestingly, the mouse hoxb <dig> protein can function as a transcriptional repressor  <cit> , and is expressed in the thyroid primordia and regulates its migration  <cit> . minimal repression domains of metazoan transcription factors are known to be often enriched with proline and alanine residues  <cit> . it is thus predicated that this region may be involved in repression of transcription. it is possible that the avian-specific gain of proline residues has contributed to enhancement of repressive characteristics or the formation of novel avian-specific motifs. additionally, we cannot exclude the contribution of the n-terminus to transcriptional activity of avian foxe <dig>  which has gained polyalanine repeats. thus, relaxed selection in the avian lineage may be the predominant contributor to the accelerated evolution of avian foxe <dig> and significant sequence divergence of the c-terminus, whereas a limited positive selection could lead to the formation of novel avian specific transcriptional motifs.

evolution of gene expression, and thus, the evolution of transcription factors, is likely to play a major role in morphological evolution. because of the pleiotropic effects of changes in transcription factor sequence, some have argued that changes in gene regulatory networks are predominantly mediated via changes in dna cis-elements  <cit> . however, negative pleiotropic effects can be limited by tissue-restricted expression of transcription factors and changes in the transcription factor sequences affecting their interaction with other tissue-specific co-factors  <cit> . this seems to be the case for foxe <dig> evolution in birds. however, directed experiments will be needed to further clarify the functional underpinnings of the evolutionary divergence of avian foxe <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
identification of functional foxe <dig> orthologs and their codon analysis can provide important insight into their contribution to vertebrate evolution, and offer a foundation for the study of their function across vertebrates. comparative biochemical studies will be necessary to determine transcriptional function and the effect of the loss of two functional domains in comparison to the other foxe <dig> proteins. building on ongoing functional and structural studies should yield a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of foxe <dig> in vertebrates.
