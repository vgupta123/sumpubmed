BACKGROUND
in recent years, it has become evident that structural genetic variants, most of which appear to be in the form of copy-number variants , can cause various common diseases, most notably neurodevelopmental diseases  <cit> . although common cnvs typable on current commercially available platforms are unlikely to play major roles in the pathogenesis of common diseases  <cit> , rare cnvs are suggested to be involved in susceptibility to common diseases, either individually or collectively  <cit> .

recently, rare variants, including rare cnvs, have received much attention in the context of "missing heritability," which indicates that common variants identified to date typically explain only a small fraction of the overall heritability  <cit> . however, statistical methods to analyze rare variants, including rare cnvs, are under development  <cit> . in this study, we report a statistical method for case-control data of genome-wide rare cnvs.

because any given cnv has an extremely low population frequency, the statistical power to detect an individual rare cnv associated with a disease is limited. this fact motivates analytical approaches that test the combined effect of multiple rare cnvs. the simplest version of such analyses compares the frequencies of rare cnvs per individual or the frequencies of genes affected by rare cnvs per individual between cases and controls  <cit> . this analysis, termed cnv burden analysis, does not identify the genes that cause an apparent association. therefore, to identify causal genes from multiple rare cnvs, methods termed gene set analyses that compare the proportion of genes affected by rare cnvs in an a priori defined gene set  between cases and controls, are used  <cit> . in these methods, typically, hundreds of gene sets are tested, and the tested gene sets are often found to overlap . consequently, the statistical power of such tests decreases after adjustment for multiple testing, and the results obtained are difficult to interpret, particularly when many gene sets show statistical significance.

gene set analyses do not use the topological features of functional gene pathways, such as those defined by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  or msigdb  <cit> . genes causing any one disease can be reasonably assumed to be functionally related and therefore closer to each other in a pathway compared to noncausal genes  <cit> .

based on this highly probable assumption, we propose a cluster detection test to detect disease-associated gene sub-pathways from a whole pathway using case-control rare cnv data. for this cluster detection test, we used a scan statistic framework, first presented by naus  <cit> , which has been applied in many different fields including epidemiological studies for detecting disease clustering  <cit> . to apply a scan statistic framework to the context of rare cnvs, we employed methods for association testing with rare nucleotide variants  <cit> . use of the proposed method has been illustrated with a real dataset in which our approach completely avoids multiple testing and the difficulties in interpreting overlapping gene sets derived from typical gene set analyses. we also evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology in a simulation study, which assumes that any one gene disrupted by cnv in a causal gene sub-pathway  may lead to a common disease.

RESULTS
application to an empirical dataset
we applied the proposed test to a published case-control rare cnv study of autism spectrum disorder   <cit> . the original paper details the dataset information. in brief, genome-wide scans for cnvs greater than  <dig> kb were performed on genomic dna from  <dig> asd cases and  <dig> controls using illumina infinium  <dig> m single arrays. considering rare cnvs that were present in less than 1% of the sample,  <dig> cnvs present in  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls of european ancestry were included in this study after stringent quality-control criteria were consistently applied between cases and controls.

using the gene pathway defined by pathway commons  <cit> , we could identify a statistically significant gene cluster only for deletions  but not for all cnvs . note that a deletion was defined as the loss of one copy  or two copies . because only deletions were significantly enriched in gene sets in cases over controls in the original paper  <cit> , we first analyzed all cnvs and, subsequently, analyzed the copy-number losses  in this analysis. the detected gene cluster includes  <dig> genes within a radius of two, which is centered on the acat <dig> gene .

to interpret this gene cluster, we examined the overlapping proportion between this gene cluster and predefined gene sets. for this purpose, we used all  <dig> curated gene sets in the broad institute's msigdb ver  <dig>   <cit> . table  <dig> and figure  <dig> list the gene sets overlapping with the detected gene cluster at a proportion of more than 50%. in table  <dig>  three gene sets  are specific to a particular disease, e.g., malignant glioma or liver cancer and are not useful for interpreting the biological function of the detected gene cluster. eight of the  <dig> remaining gene sets  are ubiquitin-related. the relationship between ubiquitin and asd has been postulated and recognized  <cit> . the ubiquitin-proteasome system operates in pre- and postsynaptic compartments and regulates synaptic attributes, including neurotransmitter release, synaptic vesicle recycling in presynaptic terminals, and dynamic changes in dendritic spines and in postsynaptic density  <cit> . we noted that ube3a, park <dig>  rfwd <dig>  and fbxo <dig> of the ubiquitin gene family were significantly enriched in asd cases according to case-control cnv analyses  <cit> . these results suggest that our approach correctly extracted a potential disease susceptibility gene cluster for asd.

this table lists the gene sets with an overlapping proportion ≥50% for the gene cluster detected by the proposed test. for this analysis, we used all  <dig> curated gene sets in msigdb   <cit> .

finally, we compared our proposed method with fisher's exact test on a  <dig> ×  <dig> table with rows corresponding to the inside and outside of a predefined gene set, and columns corresponding to cases and controls . these are not strict comparisons, because the nature of these hypotheses are different. our proposed method pertains to the null hypothesis of no gene cluster being associated with a disease in a gene pathway, versus the fisher's exact test, which pertains to the null hypothesis of no association between a disease and a predefined gene set. however, the general goal is to select gene sets with biological relevance. results of the fisher's exact test for deletions are given in table  <dig> where we used the holm's method and the benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate  method to correct for testing all  <dig> gene sets. table  <dig> illustrates that all nominal associations disappeared after adjusting multiple testing by the holm's method, with all tests having p-values of more than  <dig> . using a relatively relaxed threshold of  <dig>  fdr , the top seven gene sets appeared significantly associated with asd. these seven gene sets are not among the gene sets overlapping with the detected gene cluster . it should be noted that the gene sets in table  <dig> were selected based on an overlap with the detected gene cluster, while the gene sets in table  <dig> were selected based on an association with asd. therefore, to compare these two methods, a direct comparison between the detected gene cluster and the gene sets in table  <dig> would be preferable. for this comparison, table  <dig> also illustrates some overlap, though a relatively small one, with the detected gene cluster. this is presumably because these gene sets are not strongly associated with asd.

this table lists the  <dig> most statistically significant gene sets as determined by a one-tailed fisher's exact test, according to pinto  <cit> . this analysis was based on the  <dig> ×  <dig> contingency table shown in table 3b. multiple testing was adjusted using benjamini-hochberg and holm's procedures. results of unadjusted and adjusted tests  are referred to as nominal p-value, fdr q-value, and holm's p-value, respectively. overlap proportions with the gene cluster detected by the proposed test are referred to as overlap proportion.

type i error rate and power
subsequently, we conducted a simulation study to assess the type i error rate and power of the proposed approach. first, we estimated the standard statistical power, which is the probability that the null hypothesis is rejected at a significance level of α =  <dig> , without considering the overlap between the detected and real clusters. permutations of case-control status were used to obtain the critical values of scan statistics. for α =  <dig> , this value is defined as the 50th highest scan statistic when  <dig> permutated replicates are used. the estimated power then equals the proportion of  <dig> simulated datasets that have a scan statistic higher than the critical value obtained from the permutated replicates. for the simulated datasets generated at a cluster risk ratio  of  <dig> , the proportion defined above is, in turn, the type i error rate . an empirical type i error rate of  <dig> , which is close to the nominal level, was achieved.

to evaluate the performance of the scan statistic for cluster detection, the standard power was derived in the same manner as that for usual hypothesis tests. however, it should be noted that the standard statistical power reflects the "power to reject the null hypothesis for whatever reasons," while the probability of both rejecting the null hypothesis and accurately identifying the true gene cluster is a different matter altogether. therefore, for this purpose, we used the joint power, which can be defined as the probability of accurately detecting the true cluster under an alternative hypothesis  <cit> .  

the joint power is more suitable for evaluating the accuracy of scan statistics for detecting clusters than the standard power, but the joint power is too stringent to measure the accuracy of cluster detection. for example, even if the gene cluster detected by this test is slightly larger  than the true gene cluster, the gene cluster detected is considered as "failure to detect" in terms of the joint power, although the accuracy of cluster detection is considerably high in reality. therefore, as additional measures of the accuracy of the test, we considered sensitivity and specificity  <cit> . first, we defined the sensitivity of cluster detection tests as the probability of detecting genes that actually constitute the true gene cluster, i.e., the average proportion of the number of genes in the true gene cluster that are included in the detected gene cluster. similarly, we defined the specificity of cluster detection tests as the probability of not detecting the genes that do not actually constitute the gene cluster, i.e., the average proportion of the number of genes outside the true gene cluster that are not included in the detected gene cluster.  

both summary measures are better the larger they are, with  <dig>  being the optimal. figure  <dig> shows all these measures of the test for simulation datasets generated under each crr. the standard power and sensitivity of the proposed test eventually plateaued around  <dig>   at crr =  <dig> . however, even if crr exceeds  <dig> , the joint power tends to increase slightly with increasing crr, and ends up at the same level of  <dig>  at crr =  <dig> . in contrast, the levels of specificity are quite high across all crrs  because the number of genes outside the true gene cluster  is much higher than those falsely detected .

finally, we compared the expected number of genes affected by cnvs  per case and control in the "true" gene cluster with each observed number. for calculating the expectations, we used the expectation for the binomial distribution, as shown in the appendix section. based on a mutation rate of p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  cluster size m = 100- <dig>  prevalence p = 1%, and crr γ =  <dig> - <dig> , the expected number of gene counts per case and control in the "true" gene cluster is comparable to each observation per case and control, respectively, although a smaller cluster size is preferable to fit the observations .

discussion
using a scan statistic framework, we proposed a novel method to extract gene clusters associated with a specific disease from a global gene pathway. unlike conventional methods of gene set analyses, our method completely considers the topology of the gene pathway. in the global gene pathway , each gene has a specific role determined by its position. gene set analyses dismiss such topological pathway information, which generally reduces statistical power. in fact, when we tested whether each gene set was more frequently affected by deletions in asd cases compared with the controls using fisher's exact test, statistical significance disappeared after adjustment for multiple testing, which indicated a severe loss of power . in contrast, our method detected the gene cluster showing a statistical significance for deletions, although the result was not adjusted for testing twice .

another problem with gene set analysis is overlap between gene sets. typically, many gene sets share the same genes. for example, the gene sets listed in table  <dig> considerably overlap, as shown in figure  <dig>  this overlap makes interpretation of results from gene set analyses difficult. however, this problem can be completely avoided by extracting one or a few gene clusters from the whole gene pathway. in contrast to approaches using a predefined gene set, it is difficult for this approach to yield meaningful biological interpretations of identified gene clusters.

to interpret the detected gene clusters from a biological point of view, we examined overlap  with predefined gene sets . these overlapping gene sets can then be used to interpret detected gene clusters using the consideration of each overlapped proportion as a type of "weight". although we believe this interpretational method is sufficient, it is also possible to identify overlapping gene sets more formally, using fisher's exact test on the cross-tabulation of the number of affected genes  in/out of a detected gene cluster and by gene counts in/out of a gene set.

in general, scan statistics are used for the scanning of time and space to look for clusters of events . the idea is to scan a small window over the whole "map" and to calculate some locality statistic for each window. the maximum of these locality statistics is then defined as the scan statistic.

in this study, we chose the test statistic for testing the difference between two proportions as a locality statistic for calculation ease; nevertheless, other locality statistics can be considered. for example, a locality statistic might be the p-value derived from a one-tailed fisher's exact test in this study setting. moreover, for each locality statistic, we can use a  <dig> ×  <dig> table with columns that correspond to cases and controls, and rows that correspond to the number of subjects with or without at least one cnv in each window . this approach has been previously proposed for the analysis of rare single nucleotide variants  <cit> , but it is less powerful than a method based on the number of rare variants  in the context of a quantitative trait  <cit> . therefore, we employed the latter "gene count" approach. the locality statistic used in the present study is the same as the cumulative minor-allele test  statistic, which was developed for analyzing rare nucleotide variants  <cit> . note that other statistics that collapse genotypes at multiple rare nucleotide variants into a univariate test may be used as a locality statistic for the scan statistic proposed here  <cit> .

 this table summarizes the cross-tabulation between the disease status  and the location of each gene affected by cnvs  in terms of subject number. xi and yi denote to the number of genes in a window z that were affected by cnvs of the ith case and control, respectively. m <dig> and m <dig> denote the total number of subjects with genes affected by cnvs in cases and controls, respectively. "affected genes" mean genes affected by cnvs in a sample. i is an indicator variable taking the value  <dig> if a > <dig> and  <dig> otherwise.

 this table summarizes the cross-tabulation between disease status  and the location of each gene affected by cnvs  in terms of a gene count. xi and yi denote the number of genes in a window z that were affected by cnvs of the ith case and control, respectively. n <dig> and n <dig> denote the total number of genes affected by cnvs in cases and controls, respectively. "affected genes" mean genes affected by cnvs.

although scan statistics make no assumptions about the shape of the scanning window in general, we used a circular window for computational feasibility. however, tests using circular scan statistics make it difficult to correctly detect non-circular clusters, and tend to detect a larger cluster than the true one by absorbing surrounding regions  where there is no elevated risk  <cit> , which leads to a decrease in power, sensitivity, and specificity. in fact, the gene cluster detected in the asd dataset is relatively large but may, in fact, be smaller than estimated. therefore, scan statistics using flexibly shaped windows are preferred, although a more efficient algorithm is needed for practical feasibility.

next, to evaluate the performance of the proposed scan statistic, we conducted a simulation study based on a simplified scenario, which assumes that genes causative for a disease will be localized proximally to each other in a gene pathway, resulting in one causal gene cluster  <cit> . this simulation also assumes that any one variant in these genes may lead to disease  <cit> . in this scenario, the simulation revealed that the statistic shows a high level of accuracy in detecting circular clusters with crr ≥  <dig> , where crr is defined as the risk of developing a disease in a person with at least one cnv in a causal gene cluster versus a person with no cnv in that cluster.

based on the simulation scenarios used here, the expected number of genes affected by cnvs per case and control in a "true" gene cluster is comparable to each observation per case and control, respectively, although a smaller cluster size is preferable to fit the observations . thus, the simulation scheme used appears reasonable to some extent, although other radii, sizes, and locations of gene clusters were not investigated.

this table compares the expected number of genes affected by cnvs in the most likely gene cluster per case and control with each observation. the expected numbers were calculated from the disease model for crr =  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  and cluster size =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> .

with regard to a gene pathway, in this study, we treated a gene pathway as an undirected graph, where the direction of the interaction  between genes  is not specified. in addition, we defined the shortest paths among all pairs of nodes as distances, which were calculated using the dijksta's algorithm implemented in the rbgl package  <cit> . this definition of distance is commonly used in the functional genomics field  <cit> , but other definitions should also be investigated in terms of graph theory.

finally, as our method is expected to strongly depend on the spatial configuration of genes, an extensive and reliable functional gene pathway is crucial for its performance. our knowledge of human pathways is still far from complete, and thus, the extent to which our method is influenced by incomplete information remains to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has provided a sound statistical framework for analyzing genome-wide rare cnv data by incorporating gene pathway information. the scan statistic approach proposed here shows a high level of accuracy in detecting gene clusters in a whole gene pathway. for other settings, this framework can be easily applied by choosing locality statistics suitable for the desired purposes. this proposed method is not restricted to cnvs and can, in principle, be used for analyzing genome-wide resequencing data. with the amount and quality of gene pathway information expanding rapidly, the method of handling such information in a statistically proper manner is becoming increasingly important for analyzing rare variants, including rare cnvs.
