BACKGROUND
the study of human adenoviruses  has made major contributions to our understanding of gene expression, cell cycle regulation and cancer  <cit> . the ad <dig> serotype was originally classed as 'highly' oncogenic in the newborn syrian hamster model due to its propensity to induce local tumours within  <dig> to  <dig> months following injection by various routes  <cit> . in contrast, ad <dig> does not induce tumours in newborn hamsters  <cit> . furthermore, although all human ad serotypes can transform primary baby rat kidney  cells in vitro, only brk cells transformed by the species a human ads  can induce tumour formation in immunocompetent adult rodents . in addition, substantial evidence indicates that cells transformed by species a ads actively evade the cellular immune system  <cit> . investigation of the mechanisms directing such oncogenesis has bestowed a greater understanding of cell cycle control and apoptosis; for example, it is well established that products of ad e1a and e1b genes target the retinoblastoma gene product  and p <dig> genes, respectively  <cit> . binding of prb by e1a and subsequent release of e2f plays a central role in cell cycle progression and proliferation of infected cells. in the presence of e1b  <dig> kda protein expression, this deregulated cellular proliferation is enhanced due to subversion of cell cycle control exerted by p <dig>  furthermore e1b-19k, a bcl- <dig> homolog, suppresses apoptosis. although rb and p <dig> are undoubtedly critical players in cell transformation, in order to gain a better understanding of the extent of changes involved in the process of oncogenesis, the challenge is to understand the extent of dysregulation of all the cellular networks and gain a more thorough insight of how the immune response is avoided.

all human ad serotypes can subvert the apoptotic response to the presence of foreign viral dna within the cell, however only a small subset of ads possess the ability to outmanoeuvre the immune surveillance system of immunocompetent rodents, giving rise to a tumour resulting from uncontrolled cell division. the only viral genes found to be necessary and sufficient for cell transformation by ad <dig> are the early genes e1a and e1b. the ad e1a proteins lack enzymatic activity and are incapable of directly binding to host cell dna yet can dysregulate host cell gene expression by acting as transcriptional activators or repressors and can also affect the activity of proteins of the host cell . adenovirus e1a has been shown to reduce levels of surface mhc class i expression on the surface of rat, human, mouse and hamster ad12-transformed cells, compared to cells transformed with non-oncogenic ad <dig> . however, given the complexity of interactions and pathways in vivo, it is unlikely that mhc class i down-regulation alone determines the oncogenicity of serotypes such as ad <dig>  in addition, mhc class i down-regulation does not involve a region known to be essential for tumorigenesis that consists of  <dig> amino acids unique to ad <dig> e1a and resides between two regions conserved in both e1a sequences of the ad <dig> and ad <dig> serotypes .

the persistence of cells either infected with or transformed by dna tumour viruses is dependent not only on the avoidance of the immune system but also on dysregulation of a complex network of cellular pathways. as a first step to address this issue, we have examined the global changes to cellular gene expression that occur as a result of adenovirus transformation of primary brk cells. microarray studies of adenovirus-transformed cells  <cit>  as well as cells infected with adenovirus  <cit>  or plpc retroviruses carrying the adenovirus 12s e1a gene  <cit>  indicate that numerous host cell genes are targets for dysregulation. we therefore hypothesize that the comparative analysis of gene profiles from untransformed brk cells and brk cells transformed with ad <dig> or ad <dig> e <dig> will, to a large extent, reveal expression differences between cells transformed with oncogenic versus non-oncogenic adenovirus serotypes and provide candidate genes and pathways involved in the processes of transformation and oncogenicity.

here, we report the gene expression profiles of normal brk cells and brk-derived cells transformed with the e <dig> region of adenovirus  <dig>  or ad <dig> . overall  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in normal versus ad-transformed brk cells. after data normalisation, exclusion of genes with less than a  <dig>  average fold-change in expression and bioinformatics analysis, we were able to assign identities to  <dig> out of these differentially expressed transcripts. gene ontology information was available for the majority  of the identified genes and the functional annotation suggests a wide spectrum of physiological changes that are likely to correspond to differences between transformed and untransformed cells. analysis of steady-state levels of mrnas and proteins was performed on a subset of the differentially regulated cellular genes and possible roles for these genes in adenovirus transformation  are proposed.

RESULTS
analysis of rna transcript levels from  <dig>  genes in cell-lines transformed with ad <dig> or ad <dig> e <dig> region
the microarray study was performed in order to obtain insight into how transformation with ad <dig> or ad <dig> e <dig> region affects levels of expression of rna in primary brk cells. any change from normal levels may reflect viral modification of host cell rna transcription, processing and/or stability. in total,  <dig>  rat genes were screened by genefilters cdna microarray releases gf <dig>  gf <dig> and gf <dig>  excluding control spots  the total number of genes on gf <dig>  gf <dig> and gf <dig> was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. two copies of each rat genefilters cdna microarray filter set  were screened in duplicate with labelled cdna derived from independent preparations of rna from adenovirus e1-transformed and untransformed brk cells.

identification of  <dig> differentially expressed cellular genes
following normalisation,  <dig> cdnas with an expression value above twice that of background in both duplicate hybridisations of at least one cell type were selected for further analysis. expression ratios of tgdna between duplicate samples was consistent with good reproducibility  and genes whose expression ratio was greater than ±  <dig>  were investigated further. consistent with previous studies which show cell surface expression of β2-m in ad12-tc is reduced  <cit> , β2-m was shown by the microarray study to be down-regulated between  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in ad <dig> e1-tc and is essentially unaltered in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to brk cells. however, the expression level of β2-m  was below that of twice background in any of the hybridizations so was not reported in table  <dig>  in addition, cdna clones for various alleles of mhc class i heavy chain were also present on the arrays. however, although one clone  showed upregulation of approximately  <dig> -fold in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells, this was only apparent in filter set b and not filter set a so was not taken as significant; in contrast the upregulation in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells was of low variability . most of the cdna clones with signals above twice that of background were below the usual 2-fold threshold used by microarray studies to define genes that are dysregulated . due to the low sensitivity of the arrays, it was decided to set the threshold of fold-change to  <dig> .

the ncbi accession numbers for the cdna clones on the filters used in the initial microarray study are listed with the accession numbers for the corresponding mrna records identified by bioinformatics analysis. abbreviations for primers correspond to the gene symbols of the target genes; zinc finger and btb domain containing  <dig> , v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog a  , mixed-lineage kinase  <dig> , collagen type  <dig>  alpha  <dig> , protein phosphatase regulatory  subunit 1a  and nuclear factor of activated t-cells  <dig> . positions of the forward and reverse primers within the mrna sequence are given in base pairs .

overview of alterations in cellular gene expression induced by ad-transformation
a conservative  <dig>  fold change in gene expression between two or more cell types was used for further analysis, yielding  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts. excluding expression ratios for duplicates associated with high variability , the total number of rna transcripts with known identities altered between ad <dig> e1-tc and ad <dig> e1-tc was  <dig>  in comparison to untransformed brk cells,  <dig> rna transcripts of known identities were differentially expressed in the ad e1-transformed cells with the majority of this dysregulation occurring in brk cells stably transformed with ad <dig> e <dig>  a small subset of eleven rna transcripts of known gene identities showed dysregulation compared to levels of expression in untransformed brk cells as a result of the process of transformation by either ad <dig> or ad <dig> e <dig> 

analysis of cellular functions targeted by ad-transformation
the additional file  <dig> summarises all of the differentially regulated transcripts, with expression levels in ad <dig> and  <dig> e1-tc compared to each other and to untransformed brk cells. in an attempt to identify cellular functions that are predominantly affected by ad transformation, we searched the list of dysregulated genes for statistical over-representation of functional classes. gene information was available for  <dig> clones, whereas the genes for  <dig> clones had not been identified . using gene ontology  classifications and literature searches, known or suggested functions were used to classify  <dig> of the identified genes into thirteen defined categories: signal transduction; transcription; stress & immune response; cell cycle and proliferation; matrix, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton; transport; muscle contraction; visual perception and related disorders; protein metabolism; protein ubiquitination; apoptosis; mrna processing and carbohydrate metabolism .

to identify signalling pathways involved in adenovirus transformation, data sets comprised of gene expression ratios were analysed by ingenuity. the ingenuity pathways analysis  is a system that transforms large data sets into a group of relevant networks containing direct and indirect relationships between genes based on known interactions in the literature. it was possible to map  <dig> out of the  <dig> dysregulated targets with certainty to the ipa knowledge base:  <dig> of the mapped genes were eligible for network analysis and  <dig> were eligible for functions and pathways analysis. genetic networks were created by the ipa network generation algorithm from lists of fold-change expression in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells, ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells and ad <dig> e1-tc compared to ad <dig> e1-tc. comparative analysis across all results was also performed and results were analysed in terms of biofunction  and canonical pathway .

from this analysis, six genes indicative of defined biological processes were selected for further study at the mrna level by real-time pcr; v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog a  , zinc finger and btb domain containing  <dig> , nuclear factor of activated t-cells , collagen type  <dig> alpha  <dig> , mixed-lineage kinase  <dig>  and protein phosphatase regulatory  subunit 1a . the expression levels of these mrna transcripts were investigated in the ad e1-tcs used for the microarray study and also in brk cells immortalised with ad <dig>  or ad <dig> e1a  alone. expression of col1a <dig> was investigated at the protein level by immunofluorescence microscopy and expression of rela, mlk <dig> and ppp1r1a was also investigated at the protein level using cell lysates derived from the previously mentioned cell-lines and also from cells transformed with inactivated ad <dig>  or inactivated ad <dig> . relative levels of e1a expression in these cell lines are indicated in figure  <dig>  differential splicing of the e1a transcript and phosphorylation of the e1a protein gives rise to several bands ranging from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> kda  <cit> . the cell line transformed with inactivated ad <dig> showed the highest level of e1a expression in comparison with the cell lines transformed with ad <dig> e <dig> or e1a alone. this could be related to the number of copies of the viral dna sequences that have been integrated in each cell line. previous studies have shown that adenovirus dna integrates at multiple sites  and these are subject to methylation and loss/rearrangement, such that only the transforming  are constitutively expressed in the transformed cell thus driving cell proliferation  <cit> . expression of e1a in cell lines immortalised by the acci-h fragment corresponding to the  <dig> % of the ad <dig> genome  or the hpai-e fragment corresponding to the left-terminal  <dig> % of the ad <dig> genome  is lower than that shown by cell lines transformed by the entire e <dig> region, in agreement with previous observations that the e1b region acts to increase the frequency and stability of transformation by e1a  <cit> . the lowest levels of e1a expression are in the ad <dig> e1a immortalised cell-lines; probably due to the absence of the poly  signal of e1a in the hpai-e fragment of the ad <dig> genome used to immortalise this cell line  <cit> .

genes dysregulated in ad <dig> e1-tc relative to untransformed brk cells
functional analysis of the ad <dig> e1-tc vs brk dataset showed that the most significant disease which was associated with the mapped genes was cancer, consistent with the transformed phenotype. eleven genes from the submitted expression dataset  met the threshold p-value of  <dig>  , so are classified in this high-level category by ipa . our results agree with previous microarray results indicating up-regulation of gadd45b as a result of adenovirus  <dig> infection of hela cells  <cit> . in addition, in concordance with previously findings that suggest ad <dig> e <dig> induces down-regulation of both egfr  <cit>  and col1a <dig>  <cit> , our microarray results showed down-regulation of both egfr  and col1a <dig>  in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells . col1a <dig> is the most highly differentially expressed target involved in cellular adhesion as identified by the microarray study and was investigated further. significant down-regulation of col1a <dig> in both ad <dig> e1-tc and ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells was observed at the rna level by real-time pcr and at the protein level by immunofluorescent antibody staining .

a summary of the five top scoring networks generated by ipa based on the fold-change in gene expression in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to brk cells shows that egfr and col1a <dig> are part of the highest scoring network of genes . the most significant function for this network is cancer, with twelve targets dysregulated over  <dig> -fold  mapped to this network being classified in this disease category with p-values ranging from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  the process associated with cancer that is most significantly affected by the dysregulated genes in this network is the category of developmental process of tumour cell lines . this category encompasses an assortment of findings involving the effect of dysregulation on the growth and differentiation of tumour cells: atm protein increases cellular growth  <cit>  and srf and tfap2a increase differentiation  <cit> , whereas up-regulation of cd <dig> and down-regulation of egfr are associated with a decrease in cellular growth  <cit> .

ppp1r1a is also present in the highest scoring network . ppp1r1a inhibits pp <dig>  a major serine/threonine protein phosphatase that plays roles in diverse pathways, namely carbohydrate metabolism, cell cycle, protein synthesis, muscle contraction and neuronal signalling. protein phosphatase inhibitor  <dig> mrna is widely expressed in mammalian tissue and, when phosphorylated by camp-dependent protein kinase  on thr- <dig>  the protein product ppp1r1a  is a potent and specific protein phosphatase  <dig>  inhibitor  <cit> . ppp1r1a is closely related in terms of both structure and function to the more extensively investigated dopamine and cyclic amp regulated phosphoprotein of relative molecular mass  <dig>  , which is predominantly found in the cytoplasm of neurons of the neostriatum  <cit> . the microarray study suggested that levels of ppp1r1a were increased nearly 2-fold in ad <dig> e1-transformed cells over untransformed brk cells, which was confirmed by the real-time pcr data. up-regulation of ppp1r1a at the protein level in ad5-tc, ad <dig> e1-tc and ad <dig> e1a-tc was also observed .

many of the pathways in the merged networks shown in figure 7c converge on fos, one of the downstream effectors of the mapk/erk signalling cascade involved in growth and differentiation, which the comparative analysis suggests is significantly dysregulated in the ad <dig> e1-tc . expression of c-fos is suppressed in some human tumours  <cit>  and also in rat embryo fibroblast cells transiently transfected or stably transformed by ad e1a and ras, acting on chromatin remodelling factors  <cit> . the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  pathway is one of three major mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase  signalling pathways; the others being the p <dig> mapk pathway, and the c-jun nh2-terminal kinase  pathway.

a component of the jnk pathway, map3k <dig>  was classed as the highest scoring mapped molecule by ipa assessment of fold-change regulation in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells and plays a role in the merged high scoring networks . map3k <dig>  is a member of the mlk family of serine/threonine kinases and is known to activate the jnk pathway by phosphorylating  mkk <dig>  upstream of jnk  <cit> . mlk <dig> is thought to be activated by the small gtp binding proteins rac <dig> or cdc <dig>  as rac <dig> or cdc <dig> are known to activate both the jnk and the p <dig> pathways, it has been suggested that mlk <dig>  like mlk <dig>  is capable of activating both the jnk and the p <dig> pathway by activating mkk <dig>  several lines of evidence suggest that over-expression of c-jun by the jnk pathway plays an essential role in transformation and tumorigenesis  <cit> . furthermore, mlk <dig> has been found expressed at the mrna level in epithelial tumour cell lines of colonic, breast and esophageal origin  <cit> .

the microarray data suggested that mlk <dig> is up-regulated in ad <dig> e1-transformed cells compared to untransformed brk cells by  <dig> -fold  which was confirmed by real-time pcr . significant up-regulation of mlk <dig> at the protein level was observed in ad5-tc, ad <dig> e1-tc and ad <dig> e1a-tc. the elevated expression of mlk <dig> in adenovirus-transformed cells in comparison to brk cells could be contributing to activation of the jnk pathway leading to the transformed phenotype.

genes dysregulated in ad12-tc relative to untransformed brk cells
notably fewer genes were found to be dysregulated by over  <dig>  fold by ad <dig> e <dig> transformation of brk cells compared to ad <dig> e <dig> transformation  and none of the networks returned by ipa overlap . the top scoring network  generated by ipa analysis of genes dysregulated in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells only contains two mapped molecules dysregulated over  <dig> -fold  that are classified as associated with cancer.

both col1a <dig> and plat have been found to increase the proliferation of tumour cells  <cit> . up-regulation of col1a <dig> is involved in progression of gastric carcinoma  <cit>  and the methylation status of the col1a <dig> promoter is inversely proportional to col1a <dig> expression in human cancer cell lines  <cit> , so it is possible that dysregulation of col1a <dig> is an effect of the chromatin remodelling capability of e1a. down-regulation of col1a <dig> protein was observed in both ad <dig> e1-tc and ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells . a difference between the invasive properties of ad12- compared to ad5-tc would be expected as ad12-tc can form tumours in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. ad12-tc cells are known to prefer attachment to collagen type iv over collagen type i  <cit> , but to what extent this affects the metastasis of these cells is unknown. interestingly, collagen type iv expression is affected by one of the targets dysregulated uniquely in ad12-tc cells; tissue-type plasminogen activator , a secreted serine protease which plays a pivotal role in ecm production and degradation. the main role of plat is to convert the proenzyme plasminogen to plasmin. plasmin directly degrades components of the ecm and amplifies this effect by activating matrix metalloproteinases   <cit> . given the importance of plat for ecm homeostasis, presumably the up-regulation of plat mrna, which is associated with human pancreatic adenocarcinoma  <cit>  and colorectal cancer  <cit>  contributes to tumour metastasis. plat was found to be up-regulated over  <dig> -fold by ad <dig> e <dig> transformation but not significantly dysregulated by ad <dig> e <dig> transformation .

the two other genes in the highest scoring network that were dysregulated in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells were stromal antigen  <dig>  and hop homeobox . studies in transgenic mice suggest that, although incapable of directly binding to dna, hopx acts as a repressor of serum response factor  dependent transcription by recruiting histone deacetylase  activity  <cit> . the loss of human hopx  expression evident in choriocarcinoma is thought to be involved in malignant conversion of placental trophoblasts and has lead to the suggestion that hopx is a candidate tumour suppressor gene  <cit> . furthermore, a link between human hopx and lung cancer has also been proposed, based on the observation that this gene was significantly down-regulated in primary lung tumours compared to normal lung tissue samples  <cit> . interestingly, uterine expression of hopx in the progesterone receptor knockout  mouse has been found to be increased by injection of progesterone  <cit> ; a steroid hormone known to decrease the risk of developing uterine cancer.

genes dysregulated in ad12-tc relative to ad5-tc
as transformation by ad <dig> e <dig> is highly oncogenic compared to transformation exerted by the nonocogenic serotype, investigation of differences in gene expression between ad12-tc and ad5-tc should provide a foundation that allows mapping and identification of genes involved in neoplastic transformation. this section provides insight into the comparative expression of genes in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to ad <dig> e1-tc in terms of networks. however, it is important to note that any difference between the response to ad <dig> e <dig> and ad <dig> e1-tc in vivo will involve additional factors; for example, factors involved in the immune response of the recipient animal to transformed cells are not considered here.

there is considerable overlap between the top five networks that scored highest by ipa , with the majority of molecules in the merged network associated with cancer . a total of  <dig> molecules are annotated as affecting neoplasia and eight of these are dysregulated over  <dig>  fold in ad12-tc compared to ad5-tc: down-regulation of atm, cd <dig>  cd3g, gadd45b, hpse, tfap2a and tfpi was observed, whereas levels of egfr were found to be up-regulated .

the microarray results also suggested significant down-regulation of two components of the p <dig> signalling pathway in ad12-tc compared to ad5-tc; atm and gadd45b. expression of these targets was not significantly dysregulated in ad12-tc compared to brk cells, yet was significantly up-regulated in ad5-tc compared to brk cells. therefore, it could be possible that either this represents a unique effect of product from the ad <dig> e <dig> region on the p53-signalling pathway or that a unique ad <dig> e <dig> gene product is negating the effects of a gene product common to both ad <dig> and ad <dig> e <dig> regions. the role of atm in neoplasia is not due to dysregulated levels of expression: mutated atm plays a role in neoplasia  <cit>  and the mouse atm gene decreases the development of neoplasia by acting through vj recombination  <cit> .

down-regulation of gadd45b has been associated with neoplasia  <cit> ; however levels of gadd45b were not significantly dysregulated in the brk cell line stably transformed by oncogenic ad <dig> e <dig> in comparison to untransformed brk. the down-regulation of gadd45b in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to ad <dig> e1-tc is due to significant up-regulation of gadd45b by ad <dig> e <dig> transformation, as previously discussed. another dysregulated target affected by p <dig> is tp53i <dig> ; a p53-inducible gene with no go annotation available . levels of tp53i <dig> were up-regulated over  <dig> -fold in ad <dig> e1-tc over ad <dig> e1-tc and could be exerting a tumour suppressor effect in these cells, as there is in vitro evidence that such up-regulation retards cancer cell growth  <cit> .

another dysregulated target with no go process available is the family with sequence similarity  <dig>  member b gene . fam84b, usually involved in formation of the dna repair complex, is up-regulated in breast cancer tissue, in which it localises to areas of cell-to-cell contact where it interacts with and may block the tumour suppressor function of the cell adhesion protein α1-catenin  <cit> . up-regulation of fam84b has also been reported in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas  <cit> .

the microarray results suggested over  <dig> -fold down-regulation of tfap2a in ad12-tc compared to ad5-tc. transcription factor activator protein- <dig> alpha has been suggested as a candidate tumour suppressor protein, as loss of tfap2a protein in several human cancers is associated with enhanced tumorigenicity  <cit> . loss of function of tfap2a in cancer cells could be due to hypermethylation of the cpg island from the human tfap2a, which strongly correlates with decreased expression of the gene in neoplastic breast epithelial cells  <cit> .

not all of the targets listed in table  <dig> were mapped by ipa. one target of particular interest that was not mapped by ipa was the microarray clone ai <dig>  identified as rattus norvegicus v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog a  by manual blast searching of the non-redundant nucleotide database . rela is a component of the nf-κb complex and is involved in transcriptional regulation. nfκb <dig> binds to rela to form the p <dig> /p <dig> heterodimer, which activates transcription of many genes in multiple tissues once phosphorylated on p <dig> by protein kinase a  <cit> . as approximately equal amounts of p <dig> and p <dig> have been previously reported to exist within the nuclei of ad <dig> and ad5-transformed cells  <cit> , it would be reasonable to assume that the expression of rela would not vary greatly as a result of ad12-transformation. however, others have reported that ad <dig> e1a 13s can block the proteolytic processing of the inhibitor of nfκb  resulting in unusually high levels of the inhibitor within host cells that sequester nfκb to the cytoplasm  <cit> . in the cell lines transformed with either the early region of ad <dig>  or ad <dig> , as well as in cell lines transformed with either inactivated ad <dig> or ad <dig> , levels of rela transcripts were slightly up-regulated compared to expression in untransformed brk cells . at the protein level, the up-regulation of rela was least pronounced in ad <dig> e1a-tc . if this was to occur in infected cells, ad <dig> e1a could be acting to reduce the level of rela induction which would complement inhibition of the tumour necrosis factor receptor  <dig>  signalling pathway; such a block in proinflammatory or pro-apoptotic signalling would be beneficial for viral persistence.

other targets that were not mapped by ipa but were identified by manual blast searching include zbtb <dig>  nfat <dig> and ssg <dig>  no go information about biological function is available for zbtb <dig> , originally identified as a gene within the  <dig> kbp segment flanking the tapasin locus on human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , within the extended collection of genes known as the major histocompatibility complex . as zbtb <dig> contains both a zinc finger domain and a poz domain, the suspected function is transcriptional repression. figure  <dig> shows that there is good agreement between the microarray and real-time pcr results, with up-regulation of zbtb <dig> in ad <dig> e1-tc and, to a lesser extent, in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to untransformed brk cells. all of the genes assigned to the stress and immune response category were found to be up-regulated in ad <dig> e1a-tc compared to either untransformed brk cells or ad <dig> e1a-tc . these genes include nfat <dig>  which was confirmed by real-time pcr results as being up-regulated in ad <dig> e1a-immortalised cells compared to brk cells .

steroid sensitive gene  <dig>  was originally identified as an estrogen-regulated gene whose over-expression correlated with rat mammary carcinogenesis  <cit> . subsequently, elevated expression of urb was reported in the adipose tissue of a strain of mice exhibiting mild late-onset obesity  <cit> . our microarray results indicated significant up-regulation of ssg <dig> expression of over  <dig> -fold in ad <dig> e1-tc compared to ad <dig> e1-tc . given that ad <dig> e1a has previously associated with induction of cl <dig> in rat thyroid cells and cl <dig> is down-regulated in human thyroid neoplastic cell lines and tissues  <cit> , it is tempting to consider this gene as an important player in the process of neoplastic transformation. the finding that dro <dig> expression is down-regulated following neoplastic transformation of an e1a-immortalised rat kidney epithelial cell line  mediated by β-catenin provides further evidence for the potential role of ssg <dig> in neoplastic progression  <cit> .

discussion
from the information obtained about the dysregulated genes and the levels of expression determined by the microarray study, a subset of six transcripts were selected for further study at the mrna level by real-time pcr on the basis of involvement in the immune system and/or possible involvement in oncogenesis. expression levels of mrna transcripts were investigated in the ad e1-tcs used for the microarray study and also in brk cells immortalised with inactivated ad <dig>  or ad <dig>  or ad <dig> e1a  or ad <dig> e1a . both these results and those from studies at the protein level showed good agreement with the results obtained by microarray.

gene ontology analysis of the microarray results revealed that the majority of classifiable dysregulated transcripts were products from genes that play roles in signal transduction and transcription . this is perhaps not surprising as adenovirus is known to exert a pleiotropic effect on cellular signalling pathways and perturb host cell gene expression at the transcriptional level . our real-time pcr and western blotting results confirmed dysregulation of ppp1r1a and mlk <dig>  which play roles in signal transduction pathways, and zbtb <dig> and rela, involved in transcription processes.

the real-time pcr results did suggest highly increased expression of ppp1r1a as a result of transformation with inactivated ad <dig> or the ad <dig> e <dig> region alone; however, this contradicts both the microarray and wb results, which indicate no significant dysregulation in ad12-tc, ad <dig> e1-tc or ad <dig> e1a-tc. significant up-regulation of ppp1r1a was observed in ad5-tc, ad <dig> e1-tc and ad <dig> e1a-tc so it is possible that this represents a unique effect of products from the ad <dig> region. presumably, increased expression of ppp1r1a would have a beneficial effect on virus survival by altering one of the many other pathways involving pp1; for example, the cell cycle. it is known that ad e1a directly binds to prb and releases the e2f transcription factor from prb family-mediated repression resulting in reprogramming of cells to enter s phase . the increase in ppp1r1a could complement the ad e1a mediated displacement of e2f from prb by preventing pp <dig> activating  prb; this would maintain cell cycle progression.

the results also indicated that another possible unique effect of ad5-transformation could be elevated expression of mlk <dig>  perhaps the over-expressed levels of mlk <dig> in ad-transformed cells are causing preferential activation of the jnk pathway, as indicated in figure  <dig>  leading to transformation and anchorage-independent growth.

levels of egfr in ad-transformed cells have already been well-characterised. over-expression of egfr has been observed in a variety of tumour types and it is thought that this may induce aberrant signalling, giving rise to uncontrolled cellular growth . several lines of evidence suggest that the significant down-regulation of egfr observed in ad <dig> e1-tc makes sense both in the context of kidney cells and lack of oncogenicity of this ad serotype: over-expression of egfr is associated with poor prognosis and metastatic spreading of renal cancer  <cit>  and monoclonal anti-human egfr antibody has been found to increase delay in tumorigenesis of human kidney cancer cell lines  <cit> .

the effect on the development process of tumour cells exerted by dysregulation of the other targets within these categories is less well-defined. interference of human pak <dig> mrna by sirna has been reported to decrease anchorage-independent growth of hela cells  <cit> , suggesting that the observed down-regulation of pak <dig> would adversely affect anchorage-independent growth. human stathmin  antisense dna decreases the growth of k <dig> cells  <cit> , so possibly up-regulation of stmn <dig> has a stimulatory effect on growth. the effect of up-regulation of mta <dig> on the tumour cell line is even less clear: as it is known that the fate determination of h <dig> cells is dependent on mta <dig>  <cit> , perhaps mta <dig> is playing a pivotal role in fate determination of the transformed brk cells. however, the high variance associated with the duplicates for mta <dig> suggests that the dysregulation may not be significant .

a particularly well-characterised effect of dysregulation of host cell gene expression by ad transformation of brk cells is the down-regulation of surface expression of mhc class i in ad12-transformed rodent cells, which plays a major role in the evasion of the rodent immune response to ad12-tc. it is known that the down-regulation of mhc class i molecules on the cell surface of ad <dig> e1-transformed cells is due to decreased binding of nf-κb and increased binding of the repressor coup-tfii to the enhancer, with the converse occurring in ad5-transformed cells . however, this is thought to be due to the effect of ad <dig> on the p <dig> component of nfkb  as hypophosphorylation of p <dig> in ad12-tc renders the nfκb heterodimer incapable of binding dna  <cit> , so is not likely to be affected by dysregulation of levels of rela by ad transformation. however, it is possible that the less-marked increase in rela expression in ad <dig> e1a-tc observed in this study could be acting to complement inhibition of the tnfr <dig> signalling pathway to prevent proapoptotic or proinflammatory signalling.

however, it is important to appreciate that down-regulation of mhc class i alone does not govern oncogenesis. a suggestion of the complexity involved is provided by the fact that many genes that play roles in the stress and immune response are also implicated in other pathways within the cell: for example, nfat <dig> and gadd45b.

the up-regulation of nfat <dig> at the rna level in ad5-tc was confirmed by real-time pcr, however the real-time pcr results for the ad12-tc were more variable . the dna binding domain of nfat <dig> is thought to have evolved from nf-κb and, as nfat <dig> can be induced by a wider range of stimuli than just the best characterised one of osmotic stress, the protein is thought to be a potential player in a wide range of cell signalling pathways; for example, studies in nfat- <dig> deficient mice have suggested roles in embryonic development, integrin-induced cellular migration, and proliferation  <cit> .

gadd45b, another member of the stress and immune response category, is up-regulated in normal cells in response to environmental stresses, mediates p38/jnk pathway activation by binding and activating mtk1/mekk <dig> kinase and has been found to regulate cdc <dig> and p21waf <dig> activities, resulting in g <dig> arrest, inhibited cell cycle progression, and apoptosis  <cit> . as down-regulation of gadd45b is associated with neoplasia  <cit> , it is perhaps not surprising that gadd45b was found to be significantly up-regulated in brk cells stably transformed with the non-oncogenic ad <dig> e <dig> region .

the other heavily populated go categories contain genes related to cell cycle and proliferation and matrix, cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton: perhaps unsurprisingly, as these processes are known to be altered by the transformation process. the real-time pcr and immunofluorescence microscopy results confirmed the microarray study finding that significant down-regulation of collagen type i, alpha i occurs as a result of transformation of brk cells with both ad <dig> e1a and ad <dig> e1a. collagen type i is a major component of the extra cellular matrix  and the observed down-regulation is presumably involved in the loss of growth contact inhibition displayed by transformed cells.

the lesser populated go categories defined in figure  <dig> are no less important. for example, products of the ad e <dig> region are known to be involved in subverting the host cell apoptotic response to viral infection. only four genes related to apoptosis were found to be dysregulated by ad transformation. one of these, zmat <dig> , has been found to increase apoptosis  <cit>  and decrease growth of tumour cells  <cit> . the zmat <dig> protein contains three zinc finger domains and a nuclear localization signal. wildtype p <dig> up-regulates both mrna and protein produced from the zmat <dig> gene. as over-expression of zmat <dig> inhibits tumour cell growth, a role for this gene in the p53-dependent growth regulatory pathway seems probable. comparative analysis of all dysregulated genes across the three cell lines revealed the p <dig> canonical pathway to be significantly affected . this is unsurprising, given that p <dig> is central to numerous pathways already known to be disturbed by adenovirus transformation, as indicated in figure  <dig> 

approximately 30% of identified genes had associated go processes that did not readily fall into any of the categories mentioned in figure  <dig> . the transcripts which fall into this multifaceted 'other' category are nevertheless important considerations in the conundrum of what governs adenovirus transformation. for example: tissue factor pathway inhibitor  appears in two high scoring networks  which share a degree of overlap with other statistically significant networks . cancer is one of the top biofunctions associated with these merged networks and two molecules dysregulated by ad <dig> e <dig> transformation of brk cells show a statistically significant association with this category : tfpi and zinc finger matrin type  <dig> . up-regulation of tfpi mrna is associated with human metastatic colorectal cancer  <cit> . tfpi regulates the proteolytic function of the tf-viia complex – a major initiator of coagulation pathways involved in wound healing in vivo  <cit> . given that, pathologically, human solid tumours such as colon cancer are characterised by desmoplasia and tumour stroma has been compared to a 'wound that does not heal'  <cit> , it is perhaps unsurprising that the interaction of tfpi and tf-viia has been implicated in tumour cell adhesion and migration  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the classification of genes corresponding to rna transcripts that were found to be up-regulated by microarray reported here demonstrates that many different processes have been altered as a result of ad transformation. this underlines the difficulty in unravelling the cellular networks involved in the transformation process and oncogenesis. the largest group were classified as genes encoding for proteins involved in signal transduction. one of the hallmarks of neoplastic growth is the deregulation of cellular signalling pathways. it may be possible in the future to gain insight into the dysregulation at the protein level with advances in methods for producing oncoproteomic and oncogenomic data sets and bioinformatics. our dataset serves as a starting point for further investigation into dysregulation of host cell networks as a result of adenovirus transformation. it is important to note that the relative low number of entries limits the comparative expression of genes dysregulated by ad transformation presented in this paper. in addition, the  <dig>  unique genes screened by the microarray filters used in this study represent 62% of the rat genome. as more is found out about the rat genome, it is conceivable that data relating to genes that are currently uncharacterised in this study, for example those that lack clear identities or are defined as ests, will yield more insights into the process of adenovirus transformation. further work is required to investigate which splice variant of ad e1a is responsible for the observed dysregulation at the pathway level and the mechanisms of e1a-mediated transcriptional regulation.
