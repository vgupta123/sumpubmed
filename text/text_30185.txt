BACKGROUND
the development of microarray techniques and high-throughput genomic, proteomic, and bioinformatics scanning approaches  has enabled researchers to simultaneously study tens of thousands of biological features , and to identify a set of features for further investigation. however, there remains the challenge of interpreting these features biologically. for a given set of features, the determination of whether some biological information terms are enriched , compared to the reference feature set, is termed the feature enrichment problem. the biological information term may be, for instance, a gene ontology  term  <cit>  or a pathway in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> . we call this problem the feature enrichment problem.

this problem has been addressed using a number of high-throughput enrichment tools, including david, mappfinder, onto-express and gominer  <cit> . huang et al.  <cit>  reviewed  <dig> distinct feature enrichment analysis tools. these authors further classified feature enrichment analysis tools into  <dig> categories: singular enrichment analysis , gene set enrichment analysis , and modular enrichment analysis . in this article, we propose empirical bayes solutions to the sea problem using genes as archetypal features. without loss of generality, we consider whether some specific biological categories are enriched for differentially expressed genes with respect to the reference genes.

indeed, like other enrichment-detection methods, our methods apply much more broadly. they can assess enrichment given any sub-list of features selected for future study, not just a list of genes considered differentially expressed. an anonymous referee pointed out these examples of such lists of candidate features that arise in the context of whole genome sequencing: 

•genes with snps

•genes with copy number variations

•genes with loss of heterozygosity

these examples and those of our first paragraph do not exhaust contemporary applications, and the feature enrichment problem may occur in unforeseen domains of study. thus, our illustrative use of differential gene expression as a running example should not be interpreted as a limitation.

existing enrichment tools mainly address the feature enrichment problem using a p-value obtained from an exact or approximate statistical test . for each go term or other biological category, the null hypothesis tested and its alternative hypothesis are as follows:

  h0:the go term is not enriched for the preselected genesh1:the go term is enriched for the preselected genes 

here and in the remainder of the paper, we use go terms as concrete examples of biological categories without excluding applications of the methods to categories from other relevant databases. the general process begins as follows: 

•for each go term, construct table  <dig> based on the preselected genes  genes) and reference genes .

•compute the p-value for each go term using a statistical test that can detect enrichment for the preselected genes.

here, xi  is the number of de  or ee genes  in the go category; n is the total number of de genes; n is the total number of reference genes.

multiple comparison procedures  are then applied to the resulting p-values to prevent excessive false positive rates. the false discovery rate   <cit>  is frequently used to control the expected proportion of incorrectly rejected null hypotheses in gene enrichment studies  <cit>  because it has lower false negative rates than bonferroni correction and other methods of controlling the family-wise error rate. methods of fdr control assign q-values  <cit>  to biological categories, but q-values are too low to reliably estimate the probability that the biological category is not enriched for the preselected features. thus, we study application of better estimators of that probability, which is technically known as the local fdr . hong et al.  <cit>  used an lfdr estimator to solve a gsea problem and pointed out that this was less biased than the q-value for estimating the lfdr, the posterior probability that the null hypothesis is true.

efron  <cit>  devised reliable lfdr estimators for a range of applications in microarray gene expression analysis and other problems of large-scale inference. however, whereas microarray gene expression analysis takes into account tens of thousands of genes, the feature enrichment problem typically concerns a much smaller number of go terms. while these methods are appropriate for microarray-scale inference, they are less reliable for enrichment-scale inference  <cit> . thus, we will specifically adapt lfdr estimators that are appropriate for smaller-scale inference to address the sea problem. again, we will focus on genes and go terms for the sake of concreteness. nevertheless, the estimators used can be applied to other features and to other biological terms .

the sections of this paper are arranged as follows. we first introduce some preliminary concepts in the feature enrichment problem. next, two previous lfdr estimators and three new lfdr estimators are described. following this, we compare the lfdr estimators by means of a simulation study and an application to breast cancer data. finally, we draw conclusions and make recommendations on the basis of our results.

preliminary concepts
the feature enrichment problem described in the background section is stated here more formally for the application of lfdr methods in the next section.

likelihood functions
in table  <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig> are the observed numbers de genes and ee genes in a given go category, respectively. whereas n is the total number of de genes, n is the total number of reference genes. thus, n − n is the total number of ee genes. the columns gives the numbers of de genes and ee genes, and the rows give the numbers of genes in the go category and outside the go category.

let x <dig> and x <dig>  respectively, denote the random numbers of de and ee genes in a go category. the observed values x <dig> and x <dig> are modeled as realizations of x <dig> and x <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig> follow binomial distributions, namely, x <dig> ∼ binomial and x <dig> ∼ binomial, where π <dig> and π <dig> are the probabilities that a gene is de and ee, respectively, given that it is in the go category. under the assumption that x <dig> and x <dig> are independent, the unconditional likelihood is

  l=pr=nx1n−nx2π1x1n−x1π2x2n−n−x <dig>  

where  <dig> ≤ x <dig> ≤ n,  <dig> ≤ x <dig> ≤ n − n, and  <dig> ≤ πi ≤  <dig>  i= <dig> .

if we define

  λ=ln, 

and

  θ=ln−λ 

then θ is the parameter of interest, representing the log odds ratio of the go term, and λ is a nuisance parameter. under the new parametrization, the unconditional likelihood function  is

  l=nx1n−nx2×ex1ex2λnn−n, 

where  <dig> ≤ x <dig> ≤ n and  <dig> ≤ x <dig> ≤ n − n.

in equation , we take the interest parameter θ and also the nuisance parameter λ into consideration. consider statistics t and s, functions of x <dig> and x <dig>  such that t = x <dig> and s = x1+x <dig>  thus, t represents the number of de genes in a go category, and s represents the number of total genes in a go category. let t and s be the observed values of t and s. the probability mass function of t = t evaluated at s = x1+x <dig> = s, say pr, does not depend on the nuisance parameter λ <cit> . see also example  <dig>  of severini <cit> . thus, we derive the conditional probability mass function

  fθ=pr=ntn−ns−tetθ∑j=maxminnjn−ns−jejθ 

understood as a function of t.

by eliminating the nuisance parameter λ, we can reduce the original data x <dig> and x <dig> by considering the statistic t = t. however, the use of the conditional probability mass function requires some justification because of concerns about losing information during the conditioning process. unfortunately, in the presence of the nuisance parameter, the statistic s = x1+x <dig> is not an ancillary statistic for the parameter of interest. in other words, the probability mass function of the conditional variable s may contain some information about parameter θ <cit> . however, following the explanation of barndor-nielsen and cox , the expectation value of statistic s equals the nuisance parameter. hence, from the observation of s alone, the distribution of s contains little information about θ <cit> . s satisfies the other  <dig> conditions of an ancillary statistic defined by barndor-nielsen and cox  <cit> : parameters θ and λ are variation independent; ,s) is the minimal sufficient statistic; and the distribution of t, given s = s, is independent of the parameter of interest, θ, given the nuisance parameter λ. therefore, the probability mass function of s contains little information about the value of θ.

hypotheses and lfdrs
considering go term i, we denote the t, s, t, s, and θ used in equation  as ti, si, ti, si, and θi. from table  <dig>  hypothesis comparison  of go term i is equivalent to

  h0:θi=0versush1:θ≠ <dig>  

let s = 〈s <dig> s <dig> ⋯,sm〉 and s = 〈s <dig> s <dig> ⋯,sm〉. let bfi denote the bayes factorof go term i:

  bfi=prpr. 

it is called the bayes factor because it yields posterior odds when multiplied by prior odds. more precisely, the posterior odds of the alternative hypothesis corresponding to go term i is

  ωi=prpr=bfi×Π <dig>  

where Π <dig> is the prior conditional probability that a go term is not enriched for the preselected genes given s, i.e., Π <dig> = pr. thus, /Π <dig> is the prior odds of the alternative hypothesis of enrichment. according to bayes’ theorem, the lfdr of go term i is

  lfdri=pr=11+ωi, 

where ωi is defined in equation .

methods
this section is divided into two parts: 

 <dig>  previous lfdr estimators. while not unique to this paper, these methods are included for comparison.

 <dig>  new lfdr estimators. our main methodological innovations are the uses of a conditional probability mass function and of normalized maximum likelihood for lfdr estimation.

the other original contributions of this paper are the estimator comparisons of the next section. the comparisons are made by simulation and by a case study.

previous lfdr estimators
binomial-based lfdr estimator
the version of the fdr that generalizes the lfdr is the nonlocal fdr, which is defined as the ratio of the expected number of false discoveries to the expected total number of discoveries  <cit> . in our running example, a discoveryof enrichmentis a rejection of the null hypothesis of non-enrichment at some significance level α, and a false discoveryof enrichment is a discovery of enrichment corresponding to a case of no actual enrichment. .

let α denote any significance level chosen to be between  <dig> and  <dig>  for all go terms of interest, the nonlocal fdr may be estimated by 

  fdr^=minmα∑j=1m1{pj≤α}, <dig>  

where m is the number of go terms, pj is the p-value of go term j, and 1{pj≤α} is the indicator such that 1{pj≤α}= <dig> if pj ≤ α is true and 1{pj≤α}= <dig> otherwise. thus, ∑j=1m1{pj≤α} represents the number of discoveries of enriched go terms, and mα estimates the number of such discoveries that are false.

let ri be the rank of the p-value of go term i, e.g., ri =  <dig> if the p-value of go term i is the smallest among all p-values of m go terms. based on a modification of equation , the binomial-based estimator of lfdr of the go term i is

  lfdr^i=minmp2ri2ri, <dig> ri≤m <dig> ,ri>m <dig>  

it is conservative in the sense that it tends to overestimate lfdr  <cit> .

histogram-based lfdr estimator
efron  <cit>  devised reliable histogram-based lfdr estimators for a range of applications in microarray gene expression analysis and other problems of large-scale inference. let zi = Φ −  <dig> be the z-transformed statistic of go term i, where Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function  and pi is the 2-sided p-value of go term i. for each go term, the density is a mixture of the form

  f=Π0f0+f <dig>  

where f <dig> is the density function of z for the non-enriched go terms, f <dig> is that for the enriched go terms, and Π <dig> is the probability that a go term is non-enriched. the histogram-based lfdr of go term i is estimated by equation :

  lfdr^i=f0^f^, 

where f^ is the estimator of f that is estimated by a nonparametric poisson regression method  <cit> . we call lfdr^ithe histogram-based estimator  if the density function f <dig> is assumed to be standard normal, n, and the histogram-based estimator with empirical null  if the density function f <dig> is estimated based on the truncated maximum likelihood technique of  <cit> . dalmasso et al.  <cit>  compared the precursor of hbe-en  <cit>  to other lfdr estimators.

new lfdr estimators
type ii maximum likelihood estimator
bickel  <cit>  follows good  <cit>  in calling the maximization of likelihood over a hyperparameter type ii maximum likelihood to distinguish it from the usual type i maximum likelihood, which pertains only to models that lack random parameters. type ii maximum likelihood has been applied to parametric mixture models  for the analysis of microarray data  <cit> , proteomics data  <cit> , and genetic association data  <cit> . in this section, we adapt the approach to the feature enrichment problem by using the conditional probability mass function defined above. the particular models we use in this framework correspond to new methods of enrichment analysis.

let g={gθ;θ≥0} be a parametric family of probability mass functions with 

  gθ=12×fθ+f−θ, 

where fθ is defined in equation . we define the k-component pmmas

  g=∑j=0k−1Πjgθj, 

where θ <dig> =  <dig> and θj≠θj for all j,j∈ <dig> …,k− <dig> such that j≠j.

let t = 〈t <dig> t <dig> ⋯,tm〉 and t = 〈t <dig> t <dig> ⋯,tm〉 be vectors of the tis and tis used in equation . assuming ti is independent of tj and sj for all i,j∈ <dig> …,m such that j≠j. i≠j, the joint probability mass function is

  g=∏i=1mg=∏i=1mg, 

where si is the observed value of si for go term i, and s=〈s <dig> s <dig> ⋯,sm〉.

moreover, we assume that for a given number of genes in go term i, ti satisfies the k-component pmm shown in equation . in other words, we assume that the possible log odds ratios of go term i are the θ <dig> θ <dig> θ <dig> …,θk −  <dig> of equation  if the alternative hypothesis h <dig> in hypothesis comparison  is true.

therefore, the log-likelihood function under the k-component pmm for all go terms is

  logl=logg=∑i=1mlog∑j=0k−1Πjgθj. 

the lfdr of go term i is estimated by

  lfdr^i=Π^0gθ0g, 

where θ^ <dig> …,θ^k− <dig> and Π^ <dig> …,Π^k− <dig> are maximum likelihood estimates of θ <dig> …,θk −  <dig> and Π <dig> …,Πk −  <dig> in equation . we call lfdr^i the k-component maximum likelihood estimator . our lfdrenrich and lfdrhat software suites of r functions that implement mle <dig> and mle <dig> are now available at http://www.statomics.com. moreover, θ^i  and Π^j , also in lfdrenrich and lfdrhat, are maximum likelihood estimators of θi  and Πj  under given constraints.

lfdr estimator based on the normalized maximum likelihood
combining equations -, we obtain

  lfdri=1+bfi×Π0− <dig>  

therefore, given a guessed value of Π <dig>  we may use an estimator of the bayes factor to estimate the lfdr of a go term.

we now develop such an estimator of the bayes factor. for go category i, let ei stand for the set of all probability mass functions defined on { <dig> ,…,si}, the set of all possible values of ti. based on hypothesis comparison , the set of log odds ratios, denoted as ℋ, is {0} under the null hypothesis and is r∖0=θ∈r:θ≠ <dig>  the set of all real values except  <dig>  under the alternative hypothesis. with the assumption that random variable ti is independent of random variable sj for any i≠j, the regret of a predictive mass function f¯∈ei is a measure of how well it predicts the observed value ti∈{ <dig> ,…,si}. the regret is defined as

  reg=logfθ^if¯, 

where θ^i is a type i mle with respect to ℋ under observed values ti given si <cit> .

for all members of ei, the optimal predictive conditional probability mass function of go category i and the hypothesis that θi∈ℋ is denoted by fi†. it minimizes the maximal regret in sample space { <dig> ,…,si} in the sense that it satisfies

  fi†=argminf¯∈eimaxt∈ <dig> ,…,sireg. 

it is well known  <cit>  that the predictive probability mass function that satisfies equation  is 

  fi†=maxθ∈ℋfθki†, 

where fθ is the conditional probability mass function defined in equation , and ki† is a constant defined as

  ki†=maxθ∈ℋfθ=∑y=maxminmaxθ∈ℋfθ=∑y=maxminnyn−nsi−yeyθ^i∑j=maxminnjn−nsi−jejθ^i, 

where

  θ^i=argmaxθ∈ℋfθ. 

we call fi† the normalized maximum likelihood  associated with the hypothesis that θi∈ℋ.

thus, bfi is approximated by

  bf^i†=fi†fi†, 

which we call the nml ratio. . therefore, by combining equations  and , if we guess the prior probability Π <dig>  the lfdr estimate of go category i in the hypothesis comparison  is

  lfdr^i†=1+1−Π0Π0×bf^i†− <dig>  

where bf^i† is defined in equation . we call this lfdr estimator the nml estimator .

to assess the reliability of nml ratio bf^i† for a particular data set, it will be compared to an empirical bayes estimate of the bayes factor that unlike nml, simultaneously takes all go terms into account. equations  and  suggest

  bf^i=1−lfdr^ilfdr^i×1−Π^0Π^ <dig> 

as the empirical bayes estimator of bfi.

RESULTS
in this section, we compared the lfdr estimators using simulation data and breast cancer data.

for each go category, the p-value used in bbe to estimate lfdr is computed based on the 2-sided fisher’s exact test. in computing mlek , θi  in equation  was constrained to lie between  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas Πi  in equation  was allowed to take any value between  <dig> and  <dig> such that ∑i=0k−1Πi= <dig> 

simulation studies
the aim of the following simulation studies is to compare the lfdr estimation biases of bbe, mle <dig>  mle <dig>  hbe, and hbe-en. nmle is not taken into account because its performance depends not only on the data, but also on the specified prior probability Π <dig> 

the simulation setting involves  <dig>  genes in a microarray with  <dig> genes identified as de and  <dig> go terms. we conducted a separate simulation study using each of these values of Π0: 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 94%.

since the pmm behind mle is optimal when the number of enriched go terms is equal to the number non-enriched go terms, we assessed the sensitivity of mle to that symmetry assumption by using strongly asymmetric log odds ratios and by using symmetric ones. for each go term, two configurations were used in this simulation to choose log odds ratios: the asymmetric configuration shown in equation  and the symmetric configuration shown in equation . we used these values of odds ratio of the ith go term:

  ϕiasymmetric=5i <dig> ≤i≤ <dig> ,100<i≤100; 

  ϕisymmetric=5×2i <dig> ≤i≤ <dig> −5×2i <dig> <i≤ <dig> ,100<i≤ <dig>  

considering the log odds ratios of all go terms in each simulation study, we generated table  <dig> for go term i and for each of the  <dig> simulated data sets as follows: 

•x <dig> is generated from a binomial distribution with parameter π <dig> used in equation ; π <dig> is a real value randomly picked from  <dig> to  <dig> 

•x <dig> is obtained from a binomial distribution with parameter π2=×2ϕiπ1+1− <dig>  obtained by solving

  ϕi=log2−log <dig>  

thus, according to equation , we obtain ϕi = θi log2e for go term i. each of those artificial data sets represents what might have been a real data set such as that of the next subsection.

the p-value of each go term used in bbe, hbe, and hbe-en is obtained from the 2-sided fisher’s exact test. the k-component pmm  used in mle is shown in equation  with Πj=1−Π0/kj= <dig> …,k and gθi defined in equation . for every log odds ratio sequence, we estimated the lfdr for each go term and each data set using bbe, mle <dig>  mle <dig>  hbe, and hbe-en. we compared the performances of the  <dig> estimators by means of computing the absolute value of the estimated lfdr bias. the true lfdr is computed by equation , where

 f0=ntin−nsi−ti∑j=maxminnjn−nsi−j 

and f <dig> is computed by

 1j∑j=1jfθj, 

where fθ is defined in equation .

to assess the performance of the  <dig> estimators for smaller go terms, we added simulation studies using  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as the total number of go terms. the proportion of non-enriched go terms  and log odds ratios of simulation studies are shown in table  <dig>  the simulation studies were otherwise the same as those for  <dig> go terms. figure  <dig> shows the performance of lfdr estimators by means of computing the absolute estimated lfdr bias for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> go terms with log odds ratios based on formulas shown in table  <dig> 

here, index i labels the go term.

considering every  pair of the simulation studies with symmetric log odds ratios for the case of  <dig> go terms, we recorded the lfdr estimator with the lowest absolute estimated lfdr bias among the  <dig> lfdr estimators . moreover, we determined the maximum absolute lfdr bias over the proportion of non-enriched go terms  in order to evaluate the worst-case bias of each estimator at each value of m. figure  <dig> shows the results.

breast cancer data analysis
the single-channel microarray data set used here to illustrate our new methods is from an experiment applying an estrogen treatment to cells of a human breast cancer cell line  <cit> . the affymetrix human genome u-95av <dig> genechip data are from four samples from an estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell line. two of the samples were exposed to estrogen and then harvested after  <dig> hours. the remaining two samples were left untreated and then harvested after  <dig> hours. for simplicity of terminology, we call probes in the microarray experiment “genes.” the relevant data consist of measurements of gene expression across the reference class of  <dig>  genes. the purpose of the study was to determine which genes are affected by the estrogen treatment. 

we applied the r function expresso in the affy package  <cit>  of bioconductor  <cit>  to convert the raw probe intensities from the the cel data files to logarithms of gene expression levels without background correction. in doing so, we applied the “quantiles,” “pmonly,” and “medianpolish”  <cit>  preprocessing settings.

we selected as genes of interest those that were differentially expressed between the treatment group and the control group according to the following criterion. using the lfdr as the probability that a gene is ee, we considered genes with lfdr estimates below  <dig>  as de. in other words, we selected as de genes those that were differentially expressed with estimated posterior probability of at least 80%. considering four samples of each gene in the microarray, we used the unpaired t-test with equal variances to compute the p-value. the lfdr of every gene is estimated using the theoretical null hypothesis method of efron  <cit> ; the empirical null hypotheses method can lead to excessive bias due to deviations from normality  <cit> . when we compared gene expression data for the presence and absence of estrogen after  <dig> hours of exposure, we obtained  <dig> de genes.

defining unrelated pairs of go terms as those that do not share any common ancestor, we selected for analysis all unrelated go molecular function terms with at least  <dig> de gene, thereby obtaining a total of  <dig> go terms of interest. figure  <dig> compares the bbe to the mles based on the 2-component  and 3-component  pmm. figure  <dig> displays the probability mass of go: <dig> under the null and alternative hypotheses of hypothesis comparison . figure  <dig> compares mle-based estimates of the bayes factor given by equation  to the nml ratios given by equation .

for two go terms, opposite conclusions would be drawn about their enrichment, depending on which estimator is used. as seen in figure  <dig>  the estimated lfdrs of go: <dig> and go: <dig> using mle <dig> were 100%. however, the lfdrs estimated by mle <dig> were essentially  <dig> 

using the mle formula shown in equation , and the k-component pmm shown in equation , we conclude that the sensitivity of the lfdrs of go term i estimated by mle <dig> and mle <dig> depended mainly on the sensitivity of the bayes factor, based on the number of pmm components. comparing the probability masses of go: <dig>  based on the 2- and 3-component pmms shown in figure  <dig>  we found that the probability mass of go: <dig> under the null hypothesis is larger than that under the alternative hypothesis based on the 2-component pmm . in contrast, the probability mass under the null hypothesis is smaller than that under the alternative hypothesis based on the 3-component pmm . thus, the lfdr estimated by mle is strongly dependent on the number of pmm components.

while a real data set can in that way indicate the impact of selecting an appropriate method, that impact does not in itself say which method has lowest bias. for that, we rely on the simulation study of the previous subsection.

CONCLUSIONS
as seen in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  hbe and hbe-en have relative high biases for a small number and a medium number of go terms, respectively. the performance comparison displayed in the left-hand side of figure  <dig> indicates that bbe contains the lowest minimum estimated lfdr bias for a small number of go terms  when the proportion of non-enriched go terms is  <dig>  although the minimum bias of bee is not the lowest for some Π0s under a small number of go terms, it is very close to the lowest value of bias based on plots shown in figure  <dig>  the right-hand side of figure  <dig> indicates that mle <dig> has the lowest maximum absolute estimated lfdr bias in  <dig> go terms. mle exhibits bias similar to that of bbe when the number of go terms is much larger than k except for when the proportion of non-enriched go terms is high . moreover, mle <dig> has lower bias than mle <dig> as an lfdr estimator. due to its conservatism and freedom from pmm, we recommend using bbe for a small number of go terms of interest  and mle for a medium number of go terms of interest .

finally, we recommend that nmle be used when there is only  <dig> go term of interest since none of the other estimators is able to estimate lfdr in such a case except by conservatively giving  <dig> as the estimate. otherwise, unless Π <dig> is known with sufficient accuracy, nmle is not recommended since it depends not only on the data but also on a guess of the value of Π <dig>  which in the absence of strong prior information, is often set to the default value of 50%. a closely related approach is to use the logarithm of the nml ratio as a measure of statistical support for the enrichment hypothesis  <cit>  without guessing Π <dig>  by using  <dig> and  <dig> as thresholds of the approximate bayes factors from equations  and  to determine whether a go term is enriched, we reached similar conclusions with both nml and mle . thus, in our data set, the nml ratio tends to estimate the bayes factor almost as accurately as methods that simultaneously use information across go terms. while we do not expect the same for all data sets, we note that similar results have been found for an application of a modified nml  <cit>  to a proteomics data set  <cit> .
