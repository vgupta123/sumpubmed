BACKGROUND
the process of cellular transformation involves the conversion of normal cells into malignant cells by acquisition of distinctive features such as indefinite life span, anchorage and serum independent growth, tumor formation, chromosomal abnormalities and altered gene expression  <cit> . it has been shown that if adhesion dependent normal cells are not allowed to adhere to the substratum, they undergo anoikis; however, many cancer cells can survive without adhering strongly to a substratum  <cit> . several other studies have also shown that signals related to cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion play a role in cellular transformation  <cit> . oba-shinjo et al.,  <cit>  have shown that sequential cycles of forced anchorage inhibition can act as a stimulus for development of cancer. thus, anchorage independent growth plays a pivotal role in developing cancer cell invasion and metastasis and it is considered as a hallmark of cellular transformation  <cit> .

in addition to the above, many genetic alterations also increase the proliferative potential of normal cells and desensitize them to signals that normally inhibit growth or promote cell death. these changes, which initially lead to the formation of tumors, can later also, be responsible for their metastatic spread  <cit> . more recently, it has been shown that initiation of metastatic events in tumors depends on certain specialized cancer cells that are referred to as cancer stem cells. these cells are capable of multipotent cell differentiation which implies that they can self renew and they can produce more malignant cells that migrate to other tissues  <cit> . it has been reported that the tumor phenotype and its cellular heterogeneity are modulated by the microenvironment, which comprises stromal interactions, hypoxia, paucity of nutrients, impaired differentiation, and activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition  associated pathways  <cit> . chromosomal non-disjunction and the subsequent production of aneuploid daughter cells during mitosis is also a common characteristic of tumour progression  <cit> .

the availability of xenograft tumor models has enabled the verification of the above-mentioned observations and it has allowed us to study the in vivo facets of tumorigenesis, which include angiogenesis and metastasis. although several xenograft models are available, the genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with the conversion of tumorigenic to metastatic cells are only poorly understood  <cit> .

we have developed a xenograft tumour model with transformed rat fibroblasts, which are obtained by rescuing cells from the process of anoikis. this model is based upon our earlier studies on the signalling properties of these cells during anoikis  <cit> . in our model we have demonstrated that cells that can survive the process of anoikis in the early stages exhibit properties of transformed cells such as tumour formation and chromosomal instability. they also express genes correlated with the metastatic properties of cancer cells. we propose that this model could be very useful in understanding the relationship between anoikis and cell transformation and it could be used to identify new targets for drug development to prevent cancer metastasis.

RESULTS
cell viability and transformation
we estimated the viability of f <dig> fibroblast cell line  and skin fibroblast primary culture  cells , under adherent and non-adherent conditions. when cells, from either cell type were incubated on agarose-coated surfaces, they lost their viability very significantly with passage of time, as shown in figure 1a. approximately, 15-20% f <dig> cells and 3-5% pc cells remained viable even after remaining suspended for  <dig> h; but an insignificant number of f <dig> na <dig> cells  were viable after  <dig> hrs. the surviving cells after remaining suspended for  <dig> h on agarose have been referred in text as f <dig> na <dig>  cells and pc na <dig>  cells respectively.

f <dig> na <dig> and pc na <dig> cells were subjected to the soft agar colony formation assay as described and the results are shown in figure 1b. the colonies obtained from both cell types are shown in additional file  <dig> figure s1e&f. we observe only background of  <dig> colonies from adherent pc cells , but with pc na <dig> cells approximately  <dig> colonies/1× <dig> viable cells were observed. f <dig> a <dig> cells showed  <dig> colonies, which increased to  <dig> colonies in f <dig> na <dig> cells. with na  <dig> cells, derived either from pc or f <dig> cells, a very small number  of colonies were seen due to loss of viability to near zero levels. these results clearly show that both pc and f <dig> cells exhibit the transformed cell phenotype in their na <dig> but not in the a <dig> counterpart. the colonies seen in f <dig> a <dig> cultures could be due to some partially transformed cells, containing chromosomal changes, which were present in the original cultures .

tumour formation in nude mice
to further confirm the transformed status of pc na <dig> and f <dig> na <dig> cells, all cell types were injected subcutaneously in to 6- <dig> week old homozygous nude mice . tumour formation was measured at weekly intervals. pc cells did not show any tumour growth with either a <dig>  or na <dig> cells  . with f <dig> a <dig> cells, we observed only a small nodule like outgrowth after 4- <dig> weeks post injection in  <dig> out of  <dig> animals. this nodule did not grow further and regressed. in f <dig> na <dig> cells,  <dig> out of  <dig> animals showed tumour growth after  <dig> weeks post injection and tumors grew rapidly and reached to a size of approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm <dig> within  <dig> weeks, after which tumor-bearing animals died.

histopathological examination of tumours and other tissues in these  <dig> animals was done by h&e and collagen specific masson-trichome staining. in all tumor sections, we found that the injected cells grew densely as spindle shaped neoplastic cells with crescent shaped nuclei and high amount of collagen secretion, indicative of fibrosarcomatous growth . staining pattern of lung and liver sections from these animals showed that these neoplastic cells with crescent shaped nuclei, invaded into the lung and liver between 8- <dig> weeks of post injection , indicating the metastatic nature of the tumour.

chromosomal abnormalities and clonal selection
for identification of numerical and structural chromosomal changes we did the spectral karyotype analysis of metaphase chromosomes stained with whole chromosome paints of the rat in all the cell types as described in methods. the classified karyotypes of all cell types are shown in figure  <dig> and the karyotypic formulae of all the cells studied for each cell type are shown in table  <dig>  full karyotypes including the inverted dapi images, g banded images and rgb color assigned, are shown in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  pc a <dig> cells showed a normal karyotype with a 40xy chromosomal complement indicating the veracity of our chromosomal painting methodology. f <dig> cells showed aneuploidy, which increased remarkably in f <dig> na <dig>  colony derived and tumour derived cells. metaphases analysed from all the cell types showed a t robertsonian translocation however, cells with another robertsonian translocation t , which were < 15% in f <dig> a <dig> cells, increased to approximately 25% in f <dig> na <dig> and upto 100% in colony derived and tumour derived cells. other chromosomal abnormalities also increased in f <dig> na <dig>  colony derived and tumour derived cells. these data clearly depict that cells bearing chromosomal derivative t  had a survival advantage in the non-adherent condition. these cells also had the tendency to accumulate other chromosomal abnormalities.

the chromosomal arrangement of different karyotypes from a <dig>  na <dig>  colony cells and tumour cells.

rna profiling and differential gene expression
rna was isolated from a <dig>  na <dig>  colony and tumour-forming f <dig> cells as described in additional file  <dig>  f <dig> a <dig> rna was used as reference to obtain the fold change  values in other cell types. each microarray experiment is repeated biologically and technically twice. venn diagrams of the number of genes showing up or down regulation with fc value >  <dig>  and with p value of <  <dig>  have been shown in the figure 3a. the same results are represented as volcano plots in figure 3b, c and 3d. as can be seen in the plots, the number of genes affected continues to increase with the process of transformation as shown in figure 3a. in the up regulated category this increase is represented by the expression of hypoxia related gene stc <dig>  which increased to a fc value  <dig>  in f <dig> na <dig> cells, dropped below the fc value >  <dig>  in colony derived cells and again increased to fc value  <dig>  in tumor derived cells .

tumor formation/
total rna was collected from f111-na <dig>  colony and tumour cells and validated for the selected genes of hypoxia, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and tumour formation/metastatsis from microarray data and were compared with control. genes showed the same trend in regulation in the qpcr and microarray experiments, but not necessarily by the same fold change. no change  refers to a gene whose expression was below twofold with p value less than  <dig>  for the microarray.

we classified the genes into  <dig> different pathways using genmapp and affymetrix databases . the information for the functional classification of different pathways is taken from genmapp and gene annotation list for each pathway was obtained from the affymetrix. the maximum number of genes alterations  were seen in the tumor formation/metastasis category  but the maximum quantitative change in gene expression occurred in genes belonging to the hypoxia and glycolysis pathways . we validated the expression of some genes in these  <dig> pathways  in greater detail by using quantitative pcr . the primers used for this analysis are shown in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> and the gel pictures of qpcr are shown in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  comparison of the microarray and the qpcr results, as shown in table  <dig> clearly validate the microarray data for all the genes that we have analysed.

cellular expression of hypoxia related proteins
further validation of  <dig> genes in the hypoxia pathway  was done by immunofluorescence staining of cells and immune blotting methods. the results clearly showed the maximum expression of all the  <dig> proteins in f <dig> na <dig> cells by both methods  although the colony and the tumor derived cells showed higher protein levels compared to a <dig> cells. the significance of these results could be reflected in the fact that na <dig> cells survive under highly stressful conditions.

cancer stem cell like properties
abcg <dig> and cd- <dig> are usually expressed as specific cell surface markers on stem cells. side population analysis is based upon the stainability of cells with a vital fluorescent dye hoechst  <dig> that enters live cells and quantitatively binds to nuclear dna. in stem cells the dye is pumped out due to the activity of multi drug resistance  family of proteins of which abcg <dig> is a member. due to this stem cells stain poorly with hoechst  <dig> as compared to other cells and this process is inhibited by verapamil which acts on the pump. our results with confocal microscopy showed an increase in expression of both abcg <dig> and cd <dig> proteins in f <dig> na <dig> cells and in the colony derived cells but expression of both these proteins in tumour derived cells was lower . side population  cell analysis of each cell type by flow cytometry also showed an increase in the percentage of sp cells from  <dig> % to  <dig> % from a <dig> cells to na <dig> and further to  <dig> % in colony cells but sp cell number in tumour cells was very low . this low percentage of sp in tumour cells could be because the expression of abcg <dig> protein was not maintained from na <dig> to the tumour stage because of the diversification in there expression pattern. the sp phenotype of these cells was valid because when the cells were treated with verapamil for  <dig> minutes, prior staining with hoechst, the sp cell number in each cell type was negligible .

discussion
transformation at cellular level refers to the collective changes, such as uncontrolled cell division and morphological alterations etc., which occur to convert a normal cell to cancer cell  <cit> . in this report we have analyzed the involvement of anchorage independent cell survival in inducing cellular transformation by considering the properties of primary skin fibroblast cultures and the f <dig> cell line. upon prevention of adhesion to the substratum these cells entered into apoptosis during which their morphology and gene/protein expression profile were altered significantly. na cells of both origins showed an incremental increase in the percentage of cells that are committed to die with passage of time that they have spend in the non-adherent state . in the f <dig> na <dig> cell population, about 20% cells stayed alive and they were rich in apoptotic proteins such as caspase  <dig> and they also showed dna fragmentation  <cit> . however, these cells could be rescued as transformed cells if they were plated in soft agar, or injected subcutaneously into nude mice. thus, f <dig> na <dig> cells which, as shown earlier  <cit> , exhibit both cell death and cell survival pathways, represent a transition state between normal and transformed cells, showing a preferential cell survival with a particular karyotype and an altered gene expression profile. our cells provide a model system to study the relationship between normal cell-matrix adhesion pathways and the steps that lead to the transformation of skin fibroblasts. a somewhat similar model has been reported earlier also where changes in the adhesion state in melanocytes led to their transformation  <cit>  however; there are not many similar reports available in the literature.

colony formation in soft agar
anchorage independent growth of cells is defined further by the ability of cells to proliferate in a semisolid medium  <cit> . non adherent cells that can grow in soft agar are considered transformed and those that cannot grow in this condition are considered normal. thus, colony formation in soft agar is considered to be a transition state of a normal cell to a transformed cell. we have shown here that na <dig> cells from both pc and f <dig> cell types exhibited this transition because both grew as colonies in soft agar however; the colony size for the pc na <dig> cells was smaller. our observation that efficiency of colony formation was highest for both the cell types only after the cells had remained non adherent for  <dig> h indicated that cells underwent a clonal selection during transformation after experiencing prolonged stress conditions and gene alterations imposed by non-adhesion. the high background of colony formation in f <dig> a <dig> cells but not in pc a <dig> cells indicated that if cells had been maintained in culture for prolonged periods, they would exhibit properties of partially transformed cells without undergoing anoikis, as per the reasoning discussed by rubin  <cit> . the inability of f <dig> a <dig>  to make subcutaneous tumours in nude mice is consistent with the earlier reports that murine cells require alterations in at least two collaborative oncogenes such as ras and c-myc  to exhibit full transformation  <cit> . we have earlier shown that f <dig> a <dig> has less ras activity than f <dig> na <dig>  <cit> .

tumour formation and metastasis in nude mice
when f <dig> na <dig> cells were injected subcutaneously as xenografts into nude mice they grew efficiently as fibrosarcomas, as envisaged by the cell morphology and higher collagen secretions . the minimum latent period required by these cells to grow as tumours of a measurable size was 4- <dig> weeks, therefore in this period the injected cells could be considered as 'in vivo cultures' representing the intermediate step between transformed and tumor forming cells as described by frese and tuveson  <cit> . during this "in vivo culture" period the in vitro transformed cells acquire additional properties, such as angiogenic activity and tissue invasion capacity, in order to metastasize and re-establish themselves in other tissues. in our system also cells were able to metastasize to distant organs such as lung and liver 8- <dig> weeks post-injection.

keeping in view that these metastatic cells were derived by simply rescuing them from the process of anoikis in vitro and grafting them subcutaneously in vivo we propose that our tumor model system is different from the previously reported models of cancer in which tumors arise either spontaneously or due to various environmental exposures including radiation, chemicals, pathogenic viruses and microbial flora  <cit> .

clonal selection during anoikis induced transformation
one of the important features revealed by our results is that selection of transformed cells within the cell population undergoing anoikis is done on a clonal basis. comparison of spectral karyotypes from cells at different stages of transformation were analysed as described by buwe et al., <cit> . these results showed that f <dig> a <dig> cells were cytogenetically heterogeneous because most cells showed a t  translocation with or without some other random abnormalities ; this could be a result of the prolonged maintenance of these cells in culture, however it was not sufficient to make the cell line fully tumorigenic i.e. these cells could make colonies in soft agar but did not make tumors in nude mice. during the process of anoikis and subsequently during growth in soft agar colonies and in xenografted tumors, we observed the selection of another cell type, which contained the t  translocation along with the t . this abnormality which was seen only in < 15% f <dig> a <dig> cells and < 25% f <dig> na <dig> cells was observed in 100% cells obtained from the colonies and tumors. in the latter case it was seen along with a wide range of other random chromosomal abnormalities thereby indicating that cells bearing the t  translocation had a survival advantage in the transformed phenotype. the higher range of chromosomal aberrations in the tumor cells indicated that these cells were genetically unstable. telomere length analysis done by the fish method showed that telomere length in tumor cells was significantly shorter than in the adherent f <dig> cells  thus further strengthening this conclusion. it has been reported by others that progressive accumulation of dna damage leads to the selection of transformed cells  <cit> . cell transformation is also described as a cause for increase in the instability and clonal selection in cancers  <cit> . earlier reports have also indicated that several genes from rat chromosome # <dig> are involved in the control of tumour growth or development  <cit>  and association of t  as a chromosomal marker in the phenotypic transformation of rat cell lines  <cit> . in summary the genomic instability observed in the transformed cells derived from f <dig> na  <dig> cells is an important step to accumulate mutations that are necessary for cancer development, as is reported for many other cancers  <cit> .

hif- <dig> and its role in regulating gene expression
gene expression profiles of our experimental cell types indicated that among other pathways, genes related to hypoxia, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and tumour formation/metastasis pathways are significantly affected in f <dig> na <dig> cells . in particular, enzymes from the glycolysis/gluconeogenetic pathway, such as phosphofructokinase , hexokinase , aldehyde dehydrogenase , adh  <dig>  pyruvate kinase  were over expressed in f <dig> na <dig> cells. this could be because f <dig> na <dig> cells in contrast to f <dig> a <dig> cells have less oxygen diffusion due to a rapid change in their morphology which leads to a metabolic shift from aerobic to anaerobic glycolysis for atp generation as has been shown for many cancer cells  <cit> . another related marker which is up regulated in f <dig> na  <dig> cells was slc2a <dig> , a glucose transporter required for glucose uptake for anaerobic glycolysis to sustain the viability . it is interesting to note that all these genes are known to be predominantly controlled by the transcription activator protein hif- <dig>  a heterodimeric protein normally found in the nucleus under acute hypoxic conditions by the association of the α and β subunits  <cit> . in our case we could visualize active hif-1α in the plasma membrane of na <dig> cells by immunofluorescence staining. an active hif- <dig> further binds to specific hypoxic elements that encodes for vegf , stanniocalcein , carbonic anhydrase ix , gult- <dig> and other glycolytic proteins, rb <dig>  matrix metalloproteases and osteopontin ,  <cit> . another target of hif-1α regulation is the abcg <dig> protein, which facilitates the sp phenotype and a stem cell marker, cd <dig> expression confers the combined effect, for the better survival in hypoxic conditions, were also overexpressed in all the transformed cells  <cit> . thus, the gene expression profiles of cells in our model, whether they were na <dig>  colony derived or tumour derived, support the contention that hypoxia related pathways play role in the selection of transformed cells from within the anoikis resistant cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that the process of anoikis and cell transformation can be directly related i.e., if cells are rescued from the cell death pathway induced by anoikis it is possible to obtain transformed cells. at present our observations are restricted to the cell types we have studied, but it should be noted that chemical and physical agents do not easily transform rat fibroblasts and hence rescue from anoikis could act as a natural method for getting fibrosarcomatous tumors in rat fibroblasts.
