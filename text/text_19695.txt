BACKGROUND
with the increase in multi-center studies has come an increased need to perform cellular studies that can be standardized. the responses of blood mononuclear cells are commonly used as surrogates for in vivo immune responses to adaptive and innate immune stimuli. performing cellular assays at a single central laboratory by the use of cryopreserved and shipped specimens is generally thought to improve their feasibility and uniformity. this approach has been used extensively in vaccine and tumor immunology research, and several methodological investigations on the use of cryopreserved cells demonstrate preserved viability, as well as preserved functional responses such as proliferation and the frequency of cytokine producing cells – particularly to class i-restricted antigens  <cit> . in contrast, others have reported some loss of function in cryopreserved cells  <cit> .

as part of the niaid-sponsored inner city asthma consortium, the urban environment & childhood asthma  investigation is a birth-cohort study examining the relationship between innate and adaptive immune responses, including responses to allergens, and the development of allergic asthma. there are four ureca clinical sites located in baltimore, boston, new york and st. louis.

few studies comparing the immunologic responses of fresh and cryopreserved mononuclear cells specifically examined responses to allergens and even fewer have assessed the impact of cryopreservation on the functional outcome of cytokine secretion  <cit> . furthermore, as one of the primary benefits of centralization is thought to be decreased assay variability, we wished to directly compare assay variability using a 'peripheral lab' model in which each site obtains and stimulates freshly isolated mononuclear cells to that of a 'central lab' model, in which cells are locally cryopreserved and then shipped to a central site for stimulation assays.

we found that the response of cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells  and cord blood mononuclear cells  may not correlate with those of fresh cells. we also found that by careful standardization of laboratory procedures across participating laboratories, variability within the peripheral lab model is not different from that of the central lab model. these findings indicate the need to carefully evaluate effects of cryopreservation on immunologic outcomes and demonstrate that use of freshly isolated cells is a viable alternative for multicenter studies.

RESULTS
cytokine secretion of mitogen and antigen stimulated pbmc before and after cryopreservation
we first compared secretion of a panel of cytokines from cryopreserved and fresh atopic and non-atopic donor pbmc to innate , polyclonal  and adaptive  immune cell stimuli in order to evaluate whether these responses are adequately preserved in cryopreserved cells. accumulated ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> were measured at several time points from supernatants of separate, parallel cultures . lps induced strong il- <dig>  tnf-α and ifn-γ responses that tended to peak on days  <dig> or  <dig>  pha strongly induced ifn-γ, tnf-α and il- <dig>  and lesser levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the major dust mite allergen, der f  <dig>  induced il- <dig>  tnf-α and il- <dig> in some individuals. these responses were maximal on day  <dig>  responses to bla g  <dig> were obscured by heavy endotoxin contamination and were not analyzed further.

there were significant differences in cytokine secretion between fresh and cryopreserved cells for a number of stimulants , and several responses appeared to be blunted. for example, pha-induced il- <dig> was approximately four to five-fold lower from cells cryopreserved using either of two methods. pha-induced il- <dig> peaked at day two with responses of  <dig> and  <dig>  pg/ml  for nalgene-preserved and fresh pbmc respectively. cryopreservation in a constant rate freezer  produced similar effects. il- <dig> responses to der f  <dig> also were diminished by either method of cryopreservation . lps-induced il- <dig> secretion was strongly blunted in nalgene preserved pbmc, though this was not consistently seen in the crf preserved cells.

in contrast, some responses were consistently increased in cryopreserved cells. unstimulated pbmc cryopreserved by either method produced significantly greater  amounts of tnf-α than fresh pbmc, although levels were low  for all methods . il- <dig> secretion from pha-stimulated cells was significantly greater in nalgene pbmc , and the same effect , was seen in the constant rate preserved cells .

quantitative differences in cytokine secretion between fresh and cryopreserved cells may be acceptable if there is a predictable bias and qualitative differences are preserved. we therefore examined the correlation between stimulated fresh and cryopreserved cells. we assessed the quantitative differences between the different methods using two approaches: the pearson correlation  and the concordance correlation coefficient   <cit> . the pearson correlation measures a linear relationship, and the concordance correlation measures the absolute agreement between the two methods. as seen from representative scatter plots of secreted cytokine from fresh vs. cryopreserved cells from the same individuals stimulated with pha  or der f  <dig>  there was generally poor concordance  though for nalgene preserved der f-induced il- <dig> and crf preserved pha-induced il- <dig>  there was statistically significant pearson correlation . poor correlation was also observed for other significantly affected responses, including pha-induced ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> .

not all responses were altered as strongly. in particular, lps-induced ifn-γ at both  <dig> and  <dig> ng doses were relatively well preserved with small differences only at some time points and good overall correlation . however, the majority of measurable responses to pha, lps and allergens were significantly altered with poor correlation between fresh and cryopreserved cells.

effects of cryopreservation on cytokine secretion from lps and pha stimulated cbmc
we next compared the responses of fresh and cryopreserved cord blood mononuclear cells . freshly isolated cbmc secreted significant amounts of ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig> p <dig> in response to lps . cryopreservation inhibited lps-induced il- <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig> and tnf-α , and similar effects were noted for ifn-γ . cryopreservation also significantly inhibited pha-induced il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifn = γ .

next, we analyzed the dataset to determine whether cryopreservation altered cytokine responses in a predictable fashion. in general, there was weak agreement between the fresh and cryopreserved cells with concordance correlations between - <dig>   for pha-induced ifn-γ , and  <dig>   for pha-induced il- <dig> . there were also no significant pearson correlations between fresh and cryopreserved cell responses, although pha-induced il- <dig> from either fresh or preserved cells showed a trend toward linearity .

finally, we examined the reproducibility of cytokine secretion when cells are stimulated fresh, or following cryopreservation . the reproducibility between replicate cultures of fresh cells for lps-induced il- <dig> , pha-induced il- <dig>  and lps-induced il- <dig> p <dig>  was strong. there was lower concordance, however, between replicate cultures of cryopreserved cells .

performance of fresh vs cryopreserved mononuclear cells in a multicenter study
although these data demonstrate that cryopreservation can affect pbmc cytokine secretion, cryopreservation and central laboratory cellular stimulation in the context of a multi-site study could minimize site-to-site variability, and this might outweigh disadvantages related to cryopreservation. in order to address this, we conducted a reproducibility study between the four ureca study sites and a central laboratory.

on three separate occasions, blood from a single donor was collected, diluted 1: <dig> in rpmi, and transported to each site via commercial aircraft. once received, half of the cells were stimulated  within  <dig> hours from the time of the blood draw . the other half were cryopreserved, shipped to the central laboratory, thawed and then stimulated in an identical fashion. both the fresh and cryopreserved cells were processed in duplicate so that the variability of each protocol could be determined. this experimental design allowed us to directly address variability due to performance of stimulation assays at multiple sites versus the variability of the assay at a central site after cryopreservation.

cell recovery  and viability  after cryopreservation were not significantly different between sites . consistent with what was seen in the previous experiments, cytokine secretion was altered in cryopreserved cells . for example, il- <dig> responses were generally suppressed . pha-induced ifn-γ and tnf-α secretion also were both significantly blunted , as was tt-induced ifn-γ .

values are geometric mean ; percent coefficient of variation shown in parentheses. red color and * indicates < <dig>  for difference in cytokine produced between fresh v. cryopreserved pbmc; blue color and # indicates < <dig>  for difference in variance

next, the variances of duplicate samples were compared for the two processing protocols. only three comparisons of variances were found to be statistically different when comparing the peripheral and central laboratory methods: pha-induced il- <dig>  lps-induced il- <dig>  and tt-induced il- <dig> . for all three, there was greater variability in the centrally cultured cells that had been cryopreserved than in the fresh cells cultured at separate sites.

discussion
the urban environment and childhood asthma  study is investigating the relationship between early childhood exposures to allergens and viral infections and the development of asthma. mononuclear cell cytokine responses to environmental antigens will be assessed over the first three years of life in a cohort of children at high risk for the development of asthma. the pilot studies reported here addressed the feasibility and optimal methodology for performance of those cellular assessments.

assay standardization and inter-site variability are of great importance for multicenter studies. several studies have documented substantial inter-site variation in assessing pbmc viability and responses following cryopreservation and shipment. for example, in a recent study comparing variability in cellular assays  <dig> ×  <dig> cells were shipped from a central lab to  <dig> different sites. cell recovery at those sites ranged from  <dig> % to 114%. the viability ranged from  <dig> % to 100% and coefficients of variation for hiv-1-specific ifn-γ secreting cells  ranged from 36%–256%  <cit> . while the results from these laboratories were consistent with respect to internal ranking of responses , a direct quantitative comparison between laboratories was not possible.

since direct comparisons of quantitative measurements are essential for our multi-site study, we assessed multiple approaches to minimize variability. to quantify variability we measured cytokine production from cord blood and peripheral cells that were isolated and stimulated fresh with a panel of innate and adaptive stimulants, at each laboratory . these results were then compared to the results obtained using the same donor's cells that were isolated and preserved at each site and then shipped to a central lab where they were thawed and stimulated by an identical panel of stimulants . techniques for cell isolation, cell stimulation and cryopreservation, and all reagents were carefully standardized.

using this approach, we determined that cytokine responses from cryopreserved mononuclear cells were significantly different from those of fresh cells. cryopreservation reduced il- <dig> secretion by pbmc in response to pha, lps or antigen  and also reduced il- <dig> secretion from pha- and lps-stimulated cbmc. suppression of pha-induced il- <dig> has been reported previously  <cit> . the strong and consistent suppression of il- <dig> secretion from cryopreserved cells, even while other responses are preserved or enhanced, suggests that specific cellular subsets may be affected more strongly by cryopreservation. some reports have suggested that antigen-presenting cells may be such a subset,  <cit>  and several pbmc subsets with apc function may be potent producers of il- <dig> including dcs, monocytes and b cells. additionally, regulatory t cells may be an important source of il- <dig> in these cultures and may have differential sensitivity to cryopreservation  <cit> .

we next conducted a reproducibility study using cells from a single donor that were shipped to multiple sites. protocols and reagents for the five sites had been standardized and all personnel had attended centralized training to minimize variability. using this approach we demonstrated that with careful preparation and training, inter-lab variability was more similar in fresh cells processed in multiple laboratories than using centralized processing of cryopreserved cells in a single laboratory.

many study designs seek to minimize variation by performing cellular assays at a single central laboratory using cells that are locally obtained, and shipped, usually after cryopreservation. this approach is valid so long as cryopreserved cell responses show a reasonable correlation with those of fresh cells. several reports comparing fresh and cryopreserved pbmc responses have shown that some responses remain intact. reimann et al. found that fewer than 10% of  <dig> pbmc samples lost proliferative responses to a panel of mitogens  and recall antigens  <dig>  cryopreserved pbmc from renal carcinoma patients have been shown to retain proliferative capacity to il- <dig>  capacity to generate cytolytic activity, and secretion of pha-induced ifn-γ <dig>  both of these studies were conducted at a single site and did not address the potentially deleterious impact of shipment and/or dry ice.

some of the differences among experimental results obtained using cryopreserved cells are likely due to differences in techniques, protocols, and reagents that have been employed in different studies. for example, disis et al. evaluated effects of storage on dry ice, specific media additives, and temperature at thawing on viability of cryopreserved pbmc  <cit> . in this study, cell viability was adversely affected by use of human ab serum in the media and by thawing of cells at 4°c rather than 25° or 37°c. for our study, several lots of ab serum were screened for effects on viability, and the viability of our cryopreserved samples was consistently above 90%. nevertheless, we acknowledge that there may to be steps and/or reagents in our protocol that could be improved so that deleterious effects on pbmc cytokine responses could be lessened or even eliminated. the results of our own study, and previous studies, should be interpreted with the understanding that the protocols and technical details of both the cryopreservation protocol and the immunologic assays could influence comparability of results obtained using fresh vs. cryopreserved cells.

similar to our study, several investigators have found blunted responses from cryopreserved cells, particularly to class ii-restricted antigens. weinberg et al.  found that cryopreservation blunted proliferative responses to some antigens tt and candida, but not others   <cit> . this may be due to a selective impact of cryopreservation on specific populations of antigen-presenting cells. this concept is supported by data from maecker et al. who found that pbmc responses to pooled peptides were superior to whole antigen <dig> 

data are quite limited regarding the effects of cryopreservation on allergen-induced cytokine secretion. a small study of four patients found that ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> responses to a panel of antigens, including grass and dust allergens, were maintained in cryopreserved cells  <dig>  however, these authors compared cytokine response by elispot, and the analysis of allergen-specific responses was limited to a single subject.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our data, we have adopted the peripheral laboratory model for the ureca study. our results indicate that with centralized training and standardized reagents and protocols, inter-laboratory variability of cytokine secretion assays at our four clinical sites could be reduced to levels comparable or better to that obtained using cryopreserved cells and central processing. this approach also eliminates alterations of cytokine response profiles created by our method of cryopreservation. collectively, these findings underscore the need to carefully assess the effects of cryopreservation, processing protocols and shipment of cellular specimens on specific outcomes of interest.
