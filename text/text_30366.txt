BACKGROUND
pulmonary dendritic cells, activated th <dig> effector cells, and their respective cytokine and chemokine networks in the sensitization and initiation phase of allergic airway inflammation have been explored intensively
 <cit> . the question, whether the most abundant resident cell type in the alveolar space, the macrophage, plays a significant role in these processes has been neglected in this setting for years
 <cit> . increasing knowledge about macrophage polarization brought alveolar macrophages back into focus. in the context of allergic airway inflammation the contribution of the alternatively activated m <dig> phenotype with its specific functionality appears to be of special interest
 <cit> .

m <dig> polarization encompasses at least two subtypes m <dig> and m2-like macrophages dependent on the cytokine milieu macrophages are subjected to. m <dig> macrophages differentiate in response to il- <dig> and il- <dig> whereas m2-like macrophages acquire their phenotype in response to tgf-b, il- <dig> or pge and additional tlr activation
 <cit> . m2-like macrophages release high amounts of il- <dig> and are thus considered to be anti-inflammatory. however, m <dig> macrophages are functionally considered to promote clearance of parasite infections
 <cit> , they are involved in tumor progression
 <cit> , and they contribute to tissue remodeling
 <cit> . markers for m <dig> macrophages differ between mice and man, with ym <dig>  fizz <dig>  arg specifically described to be up-regulated in mice
 <cit> , whereas expression of the mannose receptor cd <dig> was defined for m <dig> macrophages from both species
 <cit> . in humans, several markers for m <dig> polarization have been described such as up-regulation of hla-dr and increased expression of th <dig> chemokines ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl24
 <cit> . importantly, most data on macrophage polarization are derived from animal studies. m <dig> markers between mice and man are not identical, and our understanding of the characteristics of m <dig> polarization in human asthma is still incomplete
 <cit> . recently, staples and colleagues published an important paper in which they phenotypically characterized m <dig> polarization of alveolar macrophages in a group of non-asthmatic subjects and asthmatic patients
 <cit> . using the currently accepted panel of human m <dig> markers, they showed a partial m <dig> polarization of sputum and bal macrophages in symptom-free asthmatics. interestingly, the ccr <dig> ligand ccl <dig>  a key chemokine for the recruitment of ccr4+ effector cells, was prominently induced, indicating that m <dig> macrophages might also facilitate the inflammatory immune response in humans.

with the current study we extended the phenotypic and functional characterization of alveolar macrophages in asthmatic patients, by paying special attention to the late phase of allergic airway inflammation. therefore, we investigated macrophage polarization before and after endobronchial allergen challenge. as significant levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig> are predominantly present in the acute effector phase of the allergen response, we first assessed the kinetics of macrophage polarization in a murine asthma model beyond the acute phase of inflammation. to study m <dig> polarization, we further established a human in vitro model with monocyte-derived macrophages  of atopic donors. subsequently, human alveolar macrophages isolated from non-asthmatic and mild asthmatic subjects undergoing an endobronchial allergen challenge were analyzed. two doses of allergen were used in separate lobes of the subjects in order to investigate the impact of the severity of the inflammatory response on the extent of polarization. our findings confirm and extend previous findings and provide data about the plasticity of macrophages in mild asthmatic subjects under stable non-inflamed conditions and during the late phase of the allergic airway inflammation.

RESULTS
m <dig> polarization persists after resolution of the acute allergic airway inflammation in mice
to evaluate the time course of alternative activation of pulmonary macrophages a mouse model of acute allergic airway inflammation was used to study the expression of m <dig> marker genes in alveolar and interstitial lung macrophages. the mrna expression of previously described murine m <dig> markers  and inos  was analyzed over a period of three weeks after the induction of acute inflammation in mice. the inflammation kinetic assessed by inflammatory cell influx and cytokine levels in bal revealed elevated eosinophils 24 h and 1 week after allergen provocation , whereas il- <dig> and il- <dig> levels in bal were only increased during the peak of the acute inflammation at 24 h  . messenger rna expression of arg, fizz <dig>  and ym <dig> was markedly increased in alveolar and interstitial macrophages of ovalbumin sensitized animals compared to the control group  whereas inos mrna expression was not altered . the expression of m <dig> marker genes declined over time, but after three weeks amΦ still revealed a higher expression of these genes compared to the control group. interestingly, the level of expression for the  <dig> genes in imΦ and amΦ constantly fell to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at 3 weeks compared to 24 h.

in vitro m <dig> polarization of human derived macrophages
to characterize m <dig> markers in human cells in more detail, macrophages were generated from peripheral blood monocytes of atopic subjects and stimulated with il-4 ± allergen. co-stimulatory surface markers like hla-dr and cd <dig> were significantly up-regulated on the surface of macrophages in the presence of il- <dig>  compared to control macrophages . protein expression of the mannose receptor  was not regulated by il- <dig> . compared to control macrophages, the mrna expression of m <dig> markers ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> as well as clec10a were found to be significantly increased in the presence of il- <dig>  . interestingly, the mrna expression of ccl <dig> was further increased when allergen was present during stimulation with il- <dig> , whereas allergen exposure during culture had no effect on the mrna expression of other m <dig> markers.

induction of autologous lymphocyte proliferation by human mdm
as mouse m <dig> macrophages revealed an increase of co-stimulatory molecules and an enhanced endocytosis of soluble antigens
 <cit> , we investigated the potential of these macrophages to present antigen to autologous t-cells. macrophages were generated from human peripheral monocytes isolated from asthmatic patients and stimulated with il- <dig> and in addition with grass allergen extract prior to co-culture with autologous lymphocytes.

native macrophages, not stimulated with il- <dig>  did not induce any t-cell proliferation in contrast to m <dig>  macrophages which induced low but significant induction of proliferation when primed with allergen  . in comparison to professional antigen presenting dendritic cells , m <dig> macrophages revealed a five-fold lower capacity to induce specific t-cell proliferation .

analysis of cytokines in the supernatant after il- <dig> stimulation revealed increased amounts of ccl <dig> compared to control mΦ. furthermore, macrophages induced th <dig> cytokine release like il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> by lymphocytes when stimulated with il- <dig> and allergen . in contrast, tnf-α, ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig> release were found unchanged compared to medium control macrophages .

m <dig> polarization of human amΦ after endobronchial allergen challenge
next, we investigated the extent of macrophage polarization after endobronchial allergen challenge in healthy and asthmatic subjects . the inflammatory response in the control and allergen challenged segments was assessed by cell differentiation and cytokine measurements of the recovered bal fluid. the two segments that received the standard allergen dose were similar with respect to the influx of eosinophils . a lower percentage of eosinophils was found in the segment that received 1/ <dig> of the standard allergen dose . compared to baseline, levels of il- <dig> in bal increased after allergen provocation , however with no significant differences between the allergen doses . for further analysis, cells and supernatants from the two standard allergen segments were pooled. on protein level, ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> were found to be increased due to endobronchial allergen challenge with differences between allergen doses  .

the protein expression of cd <dig> measured by flow cytometry was significantly higher in macrophages from asthmatic patients compared to healthy subjects and further up-regulated after standard allergen provocation in asthmatic patients  . the mfi value of surface hla-dr was higher in asthmatic patients compared to non-asthmatic subjects but did not reach statistical significance. no differences were observed for the surface expression of cd <dig> .

compared to isolated macrophages from the saline segment, the mrna expression of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and clec10a  was increased after application of the standard allergen dose, while low dose allergen challenge increased ccl <dig> and clec10a but not ccl <dig>  . in contrast, the mrna expression of cd <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and the m <dig> marker cxcl <dig> were not changed by allergen provocation . in healthy subjects no alteration of m <dig> marker mrna expression was observed in isolated macrophages in none of the different segments .

the mrna expression of ccl <dig> and clec10a  in macrophages isolated from the standard allergen and low allergen segment correlated with the percentage of eosinophils in bal fluid . as mrna expression of m <dig> markers in healthy subjects was not altered due to allergen exposure, we normalized expression levels in macrophages from asthmatic subjects relative to mean baseline values of healthy subjects . this analysis showed an increased baseline expression of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and clec10a in macrophages from asthmatics patients compared to healthy subjects.

human amΦ from endobronchial allergen challenged lung segments are functionally altered
according to the in vitro model using human mdm and autologous t-cells from peripheral blood, we evaluated the induction of antigen-specific t-cell proliferation of human amΦ which were primed with allergen in vivo. alveolar macrophages were isolated from bal fluid by adherence and co-cultured with autologous t-cells from peripheral blood.

mean values of t-cell proliferation were higher with macrophages isolated from the low dose and standard allergen dose challenged segments, respectively compared to the saline segment . however, the overall magnitude of proliferation was about 10-fold lower when compared to the proliferation induced by pulmonary myeloid dendritic cells of asthmatic patients in a previous study. in this study dendritic cells were isolated from bal after endobronchial allergen challenge by flow cytometry based cell sorting and co-cultured likewise with autologous lymphocytes
 <cit> . cytokine and chemokine analysis of co-culture supernatants of either amΦ or amΦ + t-cells showed that amΦ isolated from asthmatics after endobronchial allergen challenge released increased amounts of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> compared to amΦ isolated from the saline challenged segment . in addition increased levels of ccl <dig> and cll <dig> were also found in bal fluid from asthmatic patients after endobronchial allergen challenge with both allergen doses .

in contrast to the human mdm co-culture model, no induction of th <dig> cytokines by cd4+ t-cells was observed. alveolar macrophages isolated from healthy subjects did not induce any proliferation nor did they release cll <dig> or cll <dig> .

discussion
this study provides evidence for an augmented expression of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and clec10a in amΦ from patients with mild asthma during episodes of acute allergic airway inflammation. the expression of macrophage ccl <dig> and clec10a was related to the degree of eosinophilic inflammation. as increased amounts of ccl <dig> have been shown to attract ccr4+ effector cells like eosinophils or specific th <dig> lymphocyte subsets
 <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that macrophages play an important role in modulating the degree of allergic inflammation. our data is in line with and confirms recent results of staples and co-workers, who showed that human amΦ from asthmatic patients display a partial m <dig> polarization already under non-inflamed conditions with increased mrna expression of ccl <dig>  clec10a and protein release of cll <dig> and ccl22
 <cit> .

it has been demonstrated in mouse models that macrophages undergo m <dig> polarization during the acute phase of allergic airway inflammation. however, the time course of polarization markers after resolution of the acute inflammation has not been investigated. our data demonstrate that the up-regulated expression of established murine m <dig> polarization markers  outlive the inflammatory response. the decline of polarization markers over time might be due to replacement by new monocytes entering the alveolar space after resolution of the cellular inflammation, which is also supported by the concordant and continuous decline of all  <dig> investigated m <dig> related genes. an impaired phagocytosis of e. coli by murine m <dig> macrophages supports the hypothesis that clearance mechanisms might be altered, making the airways more susceptible for bacterial or viral infection during this resolution period
 <cit> . therefore, polarized macrophages seem to be capable to play a role in sustaining an inflammatory condition after acute allergen exposure.

we found several markers of m <dig> polarization to be induced in response to il- <dig> in human mdm such as ccl <dig> and clec10a. these polarized macrophages induced allergen-specific t-cell proliferation and th <dig> cytokine secretion. importantly, il- <dig> polarized human mdm do not fully reflect the amΦ phenotype in asthmatics, as the cytokine milieu in vivo is not restricted to solely m <dig> stimuli.

it was previously shown that il- <dig> stimulation of murine macrophages in vitro leads to increased ccl <dig> release
 <cit> . we could extend these findings for human amΦ derived from allergen challenged segments as these cells express increased amounts of ccl <dig> on mrna and protein level after allergen challenge. however, it remains to be elucidated to which extent macrophages account for the increased ccl <dig> levels in bal of asthmatic patients since dendritic cells and epithelial cells have also been identified as prominent sources
 <cit> . we did not observe ccl <dig> release by native t-cells of asthmatic patients in our co-cultures
 <cit> . in opposite to findings of staples, we found ccl <dig> mrna already increased at baseline in macrophages from mild asthmatic patients compared to healthy subjects and additionally identified ccl <dig> to be up-regulated. ccl <dig> is a potent chemokine which attracts ccr3+ cells like eosinophils, th2-lymphocytes, basophils and correlates with asthma exacerbation
 <cit> . ccl <dig> protein has been shown to be increased in bal of asthmatic patients compared to healthy controls
 <cit> . our mrna results in amΦ show that polarized macrophages represent an additional source of this protein beside epithelial cells in response to allergen provocation in the airways.

the macrophage galactose-type c-type lectin  clec10a which we and others found up-regulated on alveolar macrophages from asthmatic patients
 <cit>  recognizes carbohydrate structures with terminal galactose or n-acetylgalactosamine residues, which are present on naturally occurring allergens
 <cit> . additionally, the mannose receptor 
 <cit>  and igg receptor 
 <cit>  are described to be increased on macrophages from asthmatic patients. whether this up-regulation is capable to alter phagocytosis of m <dig> macrophages remains to be elucidated. interestingly, phagocytosis of bacteria is impaired in patients with severe asthma
 <cit>  and igg-opsonized yeast are less effectively cleared by macrophages from asthmatic patients
 <cit> . impaired phagocytosis of bacteria was also reported from various in vitro models of m <dig> polarization, also supporting the hypothesis that pulmonary clearance of inhaled pathogens might be hampered
 <cit> . in our study, cd <dig> was not differentially expressed on macrophages from asthmatic patients compared to healthy subjects and not regulated in response to allergen exposure.

in asthmatic patients chitinases  and chitinase-like proteins  in serum and bal correlate with the severity of the disease, the degree of airway remodeling, and the frequency of asthma exacerbations
 <cit> . these molecules are released from activated monocytes and macrophages and are suggested to be linked with remodeling processes
 <cit> . ccl <dig>  a macrophage-derived chemokine has been described to attract t-lymphocytes and to promote collagen production by human fibroblasts
 <cit> . interestingly, we did not observe ccl <dig> up-regulation in alveolar macrophages 24 h after segmental allergen challenge, while we found ccl <dig> increased in mdm in vitro at 48 h after il- <dig> stimulation. this is in line with a recent in vitro study investigating the kinetics of ccl <dig> induction showing maximum release at 72 h but no significant change at 24 h after stimulation with allergen
 <cit> . in line with older reports, we found an increased expression of hla-dr and other co-stimulatory surface markers on m <dig> macrophages
 <cit> . although the results from our in vitro allergy model show that m <dig> macrophages induce t-cell proliferation and the release of th <dig> cytokines, we were not able to confirm the magnitude of proliferation and cytokine release in similar experiments using amΦ. consequently, this questions their relevance for allergen presentation. as a limitation, we did not investigate whether macrophages from asthmatic patients exhibit a suppressive function on dc-induced t-lymphocyte proliferation as has been reported before
 <cit> .

there is increasing evidence that the different models available to study the concept of macrophage polarization are providing controversial results. murine models of allergic asthma revealed that the course of the allergic airway inflammation was not influenced by the presence or absence of il- <dig> receptor-α bearing macrophages which become polarized during the allergic inflammation
 <cit> . in contrast, the transfer of il- <dig> receptor-bearing macrophages aggravated the eosinophilic inflammation in il- <dig> receptor-deficient mice
 <cit> . however, in an animal model of acute exacerbation m <dig> macrophages triggered th <dig> cytokines in cd4+ t-lymphocytes through the interaction with cd80/cd <dig>  which was not seen in a model of mild chronic asthma
 <cit> . a rhinovirus-induced exacerbation study identified m <dig> macrophages after allergen challenge which subsequently released more th <dig> cytokines and ccl <dig> after additional rhinovirus infection. on the other side, depletion of macrophages before allergen/rhinovirus challenge lead to reduced eosinophilia, ccl <dig> and il- <dig> levels
 <cit> . thus, functional consequences of macrophage polarization might become more apparent during asthma exacerbation phases.

CONCLUSIONS
the main focus of our study was the role of macrophage polarization in asthmatic patients. taken together, we were able to show a close relationship between the degree of eosinophilic inflammation and m <dig> polarization, which is characterized by an increased expression of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and clec10a. together with the data from the animal and in-vitro models these data indicate that m <dig> macrophages might contribute to the acute inflammation by their th <dig> cytokine and chemokine release. future studies need to refine functional implications of m <dig> polarized macrophages in particular with pathogen-induced exacerbations and with different asthma phenotypes.
