BACKGROUND
because there is a gap between sequence and structure, the prediction of protein structural classes is still a hot research field today. one protein usually can be classified into one of the four structural classes: all-α, all-β, α/β and α+β. many different algorithms and efforts have been made to address this problem so far. a review about prediction of protein structural class and subcellular locations by chou  <cit>  presented this problem systematically, and introduced and compared some existing methods.

in  <dig>  klein and delisi  <cit>  first put forward the prediction of protein structural classes, and shortly afterward, klein  <cit>  brought discriminate analysis method to this problem. a new weighting method  <cit>  was proposed to predict protein structural classes from amino acid composition in  <dig>  after that, another new method, called maximum component coefficient method, was proposed by zhang and chou  <cit> , which had a higher correct rate than other methods. later, a new neural networks based algorithm  <cit>  was developed that considers six hydrophobic amino acid patterns together with amino acid compositions, and a cross-validation test was used to verify the accuracy of this method. chou  <cit>  brought a novel approach to predict protein structural class in a -d amino acid composition space, which takes into account the coupling effect among different amino acid components of a protein by a covariance matrix. a method based on the scale of mahalanobis distance is proposed by chou and zhang  <cit>  in  <dig>  and it also incorporates the correlative effect among different amino acids automatically. chou et al.  <cit>  proposed the component-coupling algorithm that took into account the coupling effect among different amino acid components. this method was ever thought to be one of the most accurate algorithms to predict protein structural classes. later, zhou and assa-munt  <cit>  revealed the subtle relation among the mahalanobis algorithm, the component-coupled algorithm, and the bayes decision rule, and that the component-coupled algorithm is much more efficient than the simple geometry algorithm in protein structural class prediction.

in  <dig>  cai et al.  <cit>  introduced support vector machine, a machine learning method based on statistical learning theory, to deal with this problem. functional domain composition was introduced by chou and cai  <cit>  to predict protein structural class, meanwhile they introduced three other classes: μ , σ , and ρ , so that the prediction was expanded from  <dig> to  <dig> classes and that sequence-related and function-related features could both be incorporated into the predictor. recently, shen et al.  <cit>  introduced supervised fuzzy clustering approach to this problem. another recently developed powerful method, logitboost, was proposed by fend et al.  <cit> , which classifies protein through combining many weak classifiers together in order to build a stronger classifier; and actually logitboost has performed very well.

in this study, we developed a method based on supervised learning approach, rough sets  <cit> , to predict protein structural classes. two datasets constructed by zhou  <cit>  from scop were used to verify and test the efficiency of rough sets. the rough sets platform we used was the rosetta system developed by Øhrn  <cit> , which was a publicly available platform for data mining with rough sets. amino acid composition and  <dig> values of physicochemical properties were extracted from primary sequences of datasets to construct the decision table.

RESULTS
in order to verify the performance of this rough sets based method, we carried out self-consistency test and cross-validation based on jackknife test to evaluate the prediction results. both are thought to be the most rigorous and objective methods for evaluation of prediction.

self-consistency tests are performed against the two datasets, and the results of self-consistency tests are showed in table  <dig>  all the percentages of correct prediction on both datasets reach 100%, which is the same as the results of svm method  <cit> . the results indicated that rough sets captured the characteristics between sequences and their classes through amino acid composition and physicochemical properties.

jackknife test is performed on the datasets. the results are illustrated in table  <dig> 

through the reduction of decision tables, two sets of decision rules are generated as classifiers. the classifier trained by  <dig> domains contains  <dig> decision rules in total, and the one of  <dig> domains contains  <dig> decision rules. the distribution of  <dig> structural classes in decision rules is shown in table  <dig>  these rules can be used to classify new protein sequences to the  <dig> structural classes.

discussion
from the results of jackknife tests, we can see that α/β class has the highest accuracy, no matter compared with whichever class or algorithms. this may be related to the proportion of α/β class in the training sets in which α/β class occupied the biggest part, as shown in figure  <dig>  as a supervised learning method, it makes it easier to capture characteristics that feed more training objects to rough sets.

although the average accuracy of  <dig> domains of rough sets is slightly lower than the svm, they are still much better than others. so, from the results of jackknife, we can conclude that the performance of rough sets should have exceeded the component-coupled algorithm and neural networks in this study, and parallel with svm algorithm. in addition, since the extraction of data, coupling effects among amino acids are not considered yet, we only take into account the amino acid composition and  <dig> physicochemical properties which may influence the secondary structure of proteins. based on this point, we consider it is reasonable to believe that the algorithm based on rough sets still has potential to improve.

rough sets is a very promising method in bioinformatics. however, a quick search of biological literatures shows that rough sets are still seldom used in bioinformatics, except for some applications in medical and health related fields. one obstacle for the application of rough sets in bioinformatics may be the large amounts of biological data and the comparatively slow computational speed of rough sets algorithm. the computation of discernibility has a time complexity of o, which is still higher than many other algorithms in bioinformatics.

there are several factors that may affect the precision of prediction based on rough sets. one of them is the conditional attributes, and another is the scale of datasets. the selection of conditional attributes must reflect the relation between sequences and their structural classes. if a set of conditional attributes does not make this bridge, rough sets can not induce effective rules from the decision system. from this study, we can see that amino acid compositions and physicochemical properties certainly can be used to discriminate protein sequences from different structural classes. however, the conformation of secondary structure of protein is very complex, and there are still other factors that may influence this process and that can be taken into account to improve this method.

in theory, the more objects in the dataset, the more accurate the prediction would be; in other words, the more information there is about the problem, the more likely to induce useful rules from it. we have seen that the accuracy of  <dig> domains is much higher than the  <dig> domains. if possible, we can get more accurately predicted results through constructing as large a dataset as possible to train a rough sets model with a proper attribute set. in the future study, we will deal with larger datasets and improve the performance of rough sets based method.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we reported a successful method based on rough sets theory to predict protein structural classes. we used two datasets constructed by zhou  <cit>  to test this new method. high prediction accuracies have been achieved through self-consistency and cross-validation test. this suggests that the rough sets approach holds a high potential to become a useful tool in bioinformatics. furthermore, as elucidated in a recent review by chou  <cit> , the past progresses in protein structural class prediction had a series of impacts to the development for predicting many other attributes of proteins. we believe that the current rough sets approach might also stimulate the development in predicting other protein attributes, such as subcellular location  <cit> , membrane protein type  <cit> , and enzyme family classification  <cit> , among many others.
