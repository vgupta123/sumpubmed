BACKGROUND
citrus canker is a disease with worldwide distribution that has severe economic impact on the citrus industry  <cit> . disease symptoms consist of water soaked lesions that develop into blisters, then pustules, and, finally, cankers. in severe cases, citrus canker can lead to defoliation and premature fruit drop  <cit> . eradication of infected plants is the method of choice to control the disease where it is not yet endemic. when the disease is endemic, control is attempted by planting disease-free trees, limiting the spread between orchards, and using preventive copper sprays  <cit> . however, none of these measures controls citrus canker efficiently.

there are three types of citrus canker described in the literature: types a, b and c. type a originated in asia, probably in southern china, indonesia or india, and it is the type that is most widespread and causes the greatest economic damage  <cit> . the other two types have only been found in south america. type b  was originally identified in argentina in  <dig>  this type is present only in argentina, paraguay, and uruguay  <cit> , whereas type c is limited to the state of s√£o paulo, brazil  <cit> .

the causal agent of canker a is xanthomonas citri subsp. citri . xac causes disease on many citrus species, with c. paradisi  and c. aurantifolia  being most susceptible in the field and c. reticulata  and c. sinensis  being relatively tolerant  <cit> . importantly, no citrus species is resistant to xac after artificial inoculation, suggesting that there is no true genetic resistance against xac and that field tolerance is mainly due to variation in growth habit  <cit> .

the genome of xac strain  <dig> from brazil was completely sequenced in  <dig>  <cit>  and compared to the genomes of xanthomonas species that are pathogenic in other plants  <cit> . this comparative genomics approach has greatly accelerated the study of the molecular basis of pathogenicity and virulence of xac. xac has a hrp/hrc cluster coding for a type iii secretion system  that is used by the pathogen to inject virulence proteins, called effectors, into host cells. while several genes coding for putative effectors have been identified in the xac genome, the single most important effector is ptha  <cit> . even in the absence of the pathogen, ptha induces canker-like symptoms when transiently expressed in plants  <cit> . deletion of ptha abolishes the ability of xac to cause cankers  <cit> . intriguingly, ptha induces cankers in all citrus species while it triggers plant immunity in other plant species, thus being the prime determinant of xac specificity toward citrus  <cit> .

two variant forms of canker a have been described. the first was found in southeast asia in  <dig> infecting c. aurantifolia. the pathogen was classified as xac variant a*  <cit> . the second variant was isolated in  <dig> in southern florida in c. aurantifolia and c. macrophyla , and was named xanthomonas citri variant aw  <cit> . aw strains have been shown to be a sub-group within a*  <cit> . these strains are primarily pathogenic on c. aurantifolia and do not cause disease on c. paradisi, even after artificial inoculation  <cit> . a t3ss effector, called avrgf <dig>  was found to contribute to the exclusion of c. paradisi from the a* host range  <cit> . a recent study  <cit>  suggests that a* strains  have a wider genetic diversity than the strains that cause a-type canker.

canker b is mostly restricted to c. limon , but has also been found in c. sinensis and in c. paradisi  <cit> . its causal agent has been described as x. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii type b . even though symptoms are similar to canker a, they take longer to appear, perhaps reflecting the slower growth of xaub in culture when compared to xac. canker c has the same symptoms as type a, but, similarly to xac a* and aw, it is restricted to c. aurantifolia and does not occur in c. paradisi  <cit> . the causal agent has been described as x. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii type c . fig. 1a summarizes observed phenotypes in three different citrus species. recently, what appears to be a new type of x. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii infecting swingle citrumelo  has been reported in brazil  <cit> .

xac, xaub and xauc have been compared phenotypically and analyzed phylogenetically. all three strains present polar flagella with perceptible motility when cultured in semi-solid media  <cit> . they all grow in the presence of lactose, manitol, and celobiose. however, only xac is able to grow in the presence of maltose and aspartic acid, and it is also capable of pectate and gel hydrolysis  <cit> . xaub and xauc have little or no affinity for polyclonal antisera prepared against xac, and xac is susceptible to bacteriophages cp <dig> and cp <dig> while xaub and xauc are not  <cit> . it is notable that xaub has fastidious growth in culture media where both xac and xauc grow well, for example in agar nutrient and tryptophan-sucrose-agar media. all three grow well in media rich in glutamic acid  <cit> . multilocus sequence typing and other molecular analyses  <cit>  have shown that xaub and xauc are more closely related to each other than to xac.

under the rationale that the availability of the genome sequences and annotations of the causative agents of the b and c canker types can substantially improve our understanding of the genomic basis of the disease, we have sequenced the genomes of xaub and xauc to draft status. we have compared them with the genomes of xac and other xanthomonads. identified commonalities among the three canker genomes represent candidate genes that may help explain the differences between citrus canker and diseases caused by other xanthomonads. we have also identified numerous gene differences between the three citrus canker genomes. some of these genes were previously shown to contribute to the virulence of xac  <cit>  and are thus primary candidates for explaining the higher virulence of xac compared to xaub and xauc as well as the host range differences that exist between the three canker types.

a note on species abbreviations
the organisms studied in this work do not have names that are universally accepted. at the time when its genome was sequenced, the accepted name for xac was xanthomonas axonopodis subsp. citri. in the meantime, xanthomonas citri subsp. citri has been validly published as a name of this organism  <cit> . however, because the locus tag prefix of xac genes is 'xac' we opted for this abbreviation to avoid confusion along the text. similarly, the causative agents for the b and c cankers are known by different names, but we use xaub and xauc as acronyms so that they are in agreement with their respective locus tag prefixes. for the b species we use the name x. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii type b and for the c species we use the name x. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii type c  <cit> . we refer to the three organisms collectively as the citrus canker strains .

RESULTS
for each strain the numbers are totals for the chromosome plus plasmids. the asterisk  denotes that the numbers for xaub and xauc come from their respective incompletely sequenced genomes.

xac strain  <dig> has two plasmids, pxac <dig>  and pxac <dig> . based on similarities between contig sequences and xac plasmid sequences it appears that both xaub and xauc have plasmids. at least 46% of plasmid pxac <dig> sequence is found in xaub contigs ; at least 61% of plasmid pxac <dig> sequence is found in xaub contigs . we do not have enough sequence data to ascertain the exact number of plasmids in each xau genome.

the phylogenetic relationship of the three strains with respect to each other and to fully sequenced members of the xanthomonas and xylella genera based on their shared protein-coding genes is shown in fig.  <dig>  the tree shows that the three organisms under study form a well-defined group within the family xanthomonadaceae. this tree is in agreement with trees of the xanthomonas genus based on multilocus sequence analysis  <cit> .

at http://bioinfo.facom.ufms.br/xanthomonas we provide an interactive tool that allows user-defined gene content comparisons among all sequenced xanthomonas genomes.

genes shared by all three strains but not present in other xanthomonadaceae species
xac, xaub, and xauc have  <dig> families of orthologous genes specific to them when compared to all other fully sequenced members of the genera xanthomonas and xylella . among these  <dig> families we have identified  <dig> syntenic blocks. not surprisingly, almost half of these genes code for hypothetical proteins of unknown function. of the genes with a predicted function the genes encoding the predicted effectors xope <dig>  and xopai   are especially noteworthy. the large number of genes coding for various kinds of transporters are also worth mentioning: four tonb dependent receptors including one with homology to the escherichia coli receptor fepa, which is involved in transport of siderophores across the bacterial membrane  <cit>  and seven abc transporters, which might be used either for translocation of substrates from the citrus apoplast into the bacterial cell to provide nutrients for the pathogen, or, alternatively, for secretion of toxins . an additional transporter specific to the three cc genomes  is an alkanesulfonate transporter substrate-binding subunit, which is reported to enable e. coli to use sulfonates other than taurine  <cit> . besides transporters, several genes encode metabolic enzymes . this conspicuous presence of transporters and metabolic enzymes suggests that the cc strains might have adapted to specific metabolites present in the citrus apoplast. however, this will need to be confirmed experimentally by comparing growth of wild type strains and strains mutated in cc-specific genes in apoplastic fluid of citrus species and of other plant species. one other interesting gene present in all cc genomes is a gene coding for a methyl parathion hydrolase , predicted to degrade the insecticide methyl parathion  <cit> . orthologs of this gene and other genes that degrade organophosphates are common in soil bacteria and in the soil-borne pathogen ralstonia solanacearum but have not yet been found in any other foliar plant pathogen.

some of these syntenic cc-specific regions are anomalous in terms of nucleotide composition as determined by the program alienhunter  <cit>  and may thus have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer.

the three cc genomes have important differences in regard to their repertoires of type iii secreted effectors
the hrp/hrc genes encoding the t3ss are basically the same and found in the same order in all three cc genomes. however, there are notable differences in the three putative t3ss-secreted effector repertoires.

a list of twenty-seven t3ss effector genes predicted in the genomes of the cc strains is shown in table  <dig>  effectors are important determinants of virulence and host range in many plant pathogenic bacteria, in particular in xanthomonas sp. and pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . comparison of effector repertoires between the three cc genomes and all other xanthomonas genomes can thus give us important clues. the effector genes avrbs <dig>  xopl, xopq, and xopx are present in all three cc genomes, in all sequenced genomes of other xanthomonas species, and in all x. citri and most xanthomonas strains that were surveyed by pcr and hybridization for these genes by hajri et al.  <cit> . these effectors thus belong to the xanthomonas core set of effectors possibly important for pathogenicity on all plants. the putative effector genes xopk, xopr, and xopz also belong to this group since they can be found in all sequenced xanthomonas genomes. however, no data exist for these effectors in regard to other xanthomonas strains  <cit> . the effector genes xopi, xopv, xopad, and xopak are present in all three cc genomes and in several, but not all, sequenced xanthomonas genomes. these effectors, therefore, might contribute to disease in some plant species while they might trigger immunity in others.

some of the effectors appear to be pseudogenes . in column 'effector family' we provide the standard effector name along with the names of related proteins belonging to the same family; in column 'effectors' we provide the reference where the effector indicated was characterized.

as already mentioned, ptha is well known to be an important x. citri effector that plays an essential role in citrus canker, while limiting the host range of cc strains to citrus because it triggers immunity in all other tested plant species . the ptha gene is a member of the avrbs <dig> family of effector genes, members of which are present in most xanthomonas genomes and in some r. solanacearum genomes  <cit> . however, only ptha is known to induce citrus canker. besides ptha , three paralogs of ptha are also present in the xac genome . all four copies are found on plasmids. the three paralogs do not seem to play an important role in citrus canker  <cit> . we found two ptha homologs in the xaub genome  and two in the xauc genome . not all of these genes have been completely assembled due to the repetitive regions found in avrbs <dig> family members. however, el yacoubi et al.  <cit>  previously assembled a ptha homolog  from the pxcb plasmid  of a xaub strain with the same repeat copy number  as ptha, and al-saadi et al.  <cit>  sequenced and assembled another homolog  from a xauc strain. these genes functionally complemented a ptha deletion in xac without affecting host range  <cit> . the xauc_ <dig> gene has 99% nucleotide identity to pthc and thus probably corresponds to pthc and would be the functional ptha homolog of xauc. we do not have enough data to confidently report on the repeat copy number of the other three xau pth homologs, but a phylogenetic analysis  suggests that xaub_ <dig> is the functional ptha homolog of xaub.

to get insight into the evolution of the ptha/avrbs <dig> family, a phylogenetic analysis of all available avrbs <dig> family members in the genus xanthomonas was performed . the tree shows that the four xac pth genes group together, while the xaub and xauc genes form two families, with one member from each strain participating in each family. moreover, the xaub and xauc pth genes group separately from the xac genes, with good bootstrap support, which is a surprising result when compared with the species tree . the genes that flank the pth copies in xaub do not have xac genes as their best blast  <cit>  hits. in particular, the two genes upstream of xaub_ <dig>  xaub_ <dig> and xaub_ <dig>  do not match any xanthomonas genes; instead, their best blast hits  are gene sequences from burkholderia pseudomallei nctc  <dig>   we derive the following conclusions from these results: an ancestor of the current xaub and xauc strains already had two different copies of the pth genes; hence the existence of the two noted families. the fact that in xac the four copies are nearly identical, the fact that the xau and xac pth genes group in a way distinctively different from the species grouping, and the fact that the genomic context in which the xac pth genes are found is different from that of xaub leads us to believe that xac acquired its pth genes by a different route and that their duplication is more recent when compared to the xaub and xauc pth duplications. the ability to cause citrus canker may thus have independently evolved by xac and by xaub and xauc, and may represent an example of convergent evolution. al-saadi et al.  <cit> , based on a neighbor-joining phylogeny of pth genes that included the pthb and pthc sequences, have come to the same conclusion.

effectors xopai and xope <dig> may play a role in citrus canker
a comparison of effectors present in all three cc strains with those present in fully sequenced xanthomonas species, and data from the study by hajri et al.  <cit> , suggest that two additional putative effectors may play a special role in citrus canker. these are xopai and xope <dig>  both are present in all three cc genomes.

the putative effector xopai is not found in any other sequenced xanthomonas species and it was not included in the hajri et al.  <cit>  analysis. we do have evidence that it is present in xanthomonas vesicatoria str.  <dig> . interestingly, the c-terminal region of xopai has similarity to predicted adp-ribosyl transferase domains of the effector hopo1- <dig> of pseudomonas syringae and of hypothetical proteins in acidovorax citrulli, ralstonia solanacearum, and other bacteria. the n-terminus has high similarity to the n-terminus of the effector xope <dig> of x. campestris pv. vesicatoria 85- <dig> as well the n-termini of a number of other xanthomonas and pseudomonas syringae effectors .

xope <dig> belongs to the hopx/avrpphe family of effectors. effectors belonging to this family have been found in diverse phytopathogenic bacteria including ralstonia, pseudomonas, acidovorax, and xanthomonas, suggesting their conserved role in virulence on a wide range of hosts. sequences from this family have similarity to the transglutaminase superfamily of enzymes, which are responsible for modification of host proteins  <cit> . the hopx/avrpphe effector from pseudomonas syringae has been shown to be involved in host protein proteolysis, thereby suppressing host defenses  <cit> . in xanthomonads, multiple effectors belonging to this group have been found, such as xope <dig>  xope <dig>  xope <dig>  xope <dig>  xope <dig> and xope <dig> have been found in most of the xanthomonads. xope <dig> effector gene homologs have been found by pcr and dot-blot hybridization methods in some xanthomonas axonopodis strains belonging to the alfalfae, anacardii, glycines, phaseoli, malvacearum, fuscans, mangiferae, indicae, and citrumelo pathovars  <cit> . however, sequences of xope <dig> from these strains could not be compared against homologs from cc strains since sequence data from the x. axonopodis strains mentioned are not currently available. phylogenetic analysis of hopx orthologs shows that the xope <dig> effector genes found in the cc strains group together with hopx <dig> effector genes from pseudomonads .

although all hopx orthologs show conservation of the catalytic triad  as well as the conserved domain "grgn" n-terminal to the triad, the region c-terminal to the triad shows high degree of variability. this variable region has been hypothesized to be responsible for targeting different host proteins  <cit> . in fact, while some avrpphe  alleles from p. syringae pv. phaseolicola strains trigger gene for gene disease resistance in some bean cultivars, other alleles were shown to be virulent on these same cultivars. amino acid differences in the c-terminal region of avrpphe were identified between alleles  <cit> . similarly, comparing xope <dig> homologs from different strains at the amino acid level and their corresponding reactions on different hosts might give clues regarding the variable c-terminal domains of xope <dig> family members and might determine whether this variability is responsible for targeting different proteins in different host species.

both xope <dig> and xopai belong to an interesting xac chromosomal region of approximately  <dig> kbp in size  that has been hypothesized to be a genomic island  <cit> . an alignment of the xac chromosome sequence with the chromosome sequences of x. campestris pv. campestris str. atcc <dig> and x. oryzae pv. oryzae str. px099a strongly suggests that this region is an insertion . the presence of three transposase genes and two phage-related genes in the region provides additional evidence for this hypothesis. the central part of this region  duplicates a region found in xac plasmid pxac <dig> , suggesting a chromosome-plasmid dna exchange. in the plasmid we find the effector gene xope <dig> , which - as described above - shares its n-terminal region with xopai  . transposons and phage elements in this region might thus have been responsible for a shuffling process, described as terminal reassortment  <cit> , resulting in the novel effector gene xopai. although we can characterize this region completely only in xac, xaub and xauc contigs contain the most important elements of this region . next to xope <dig>  we find gene xac <dig>  whose product is annotated as tranglycosylase mltb. this gene has strong similarity  to hopaj <dig> fromp. syringae pv. tomato strain dc <dig>  where it is annotated as a t3ss helper protein. although the hopaj <dig> gene is not itself a t3ss substrate, it contributes to effector translocation  <cit> . a mutant with a deletion of xac <dig> has reduced ability to cause canker   <cit> . we thus conclude that the effector and effector-related genes in this region probably play an important role in citrus canker.

additional differences in effector repertoires among cc genomes
in addition to the pth differences noted above, other effectors that distinguish the xac genome from the two xau genomes are xopb, xope <dig>  xopj , xopaf , and xopag, which are all present in both xau genomes but absent from xac strain  <dig>   the absence of these effectors from xac strain  <dig> raises the possibility that these effectors might be responsible for limiting the host range of both b and c strains. interestingly, xaub and xauc strains both contain xopag, an effector gene belonging to the same effector family as avrgf <dig> from x. citri aw, which has been shown to be responsible for triggering a hypersensitive defense response in c. paradisi   <cit> . the xopag gene from the b and c genomes shows 44% identity to avrgf <dig> at the amino acid level. the xaub and and xauc genes are almost identical to each other, with one important difference: in xaub xopag is interrupted by a transposon. therefore, the incompatibility between xauc and grapefruit and the ability of xaub to cause disease in grapefruit could be explained by this single gene difference. the xope <dig> dna sequence is identical in the two xau genomes and has similarity to avrxace <dig> but only with 31% identity at the amino acid level; this is why we named this gene xope <dig> instead of xope <dig>  unlike other xope family members, xope <dig> does not have a predicted myristoylation site, suggesting that it may not be targeted to the cell membrane as the other xope family members.

presence of an additional effector gene, the avirulence gene avrxcca <dig>  has been shown in some x. aurantifolii b  and x. aurantifolii c  strains by hybridization and pcr analysis  <cit> . however, this avirulence gene was not found in the two sequenced xau genomes. a homolog of the effector xopf <dig>  was found only in the xauc strain. it is located in a 5-kbp region that lies between the t3ss genes hrpw  and hpa <dig> . the same two genes are adjacent in xaub. two transposases are present in this region, and the sequence of xopf <dig> has a frameshift, suggesting that this gene is likely the result of a recent insertion and is not active.

there are four effector genes present in the xac and xaub genomes that have not been found in the genome of xauc: xope <dig>  xopn, xopp, and xopae. these effectors could explain the wider host range of xac and xaub compared to xauc, assuming a virulence activity of these effectors on citrus species. xopn has been shown to interact with the plant protein tark <dig> and to interfere with immunity triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns   <cit> . further experiments are required to determine the possible role of xopn in extending host range to lemon, grapefruit and sweet orange. another effector that could have a similar role is xopae   <cit> .

the harpin-like protein hrpw with a pectate lyase domain is present in all cc strains. in the sequenced xac genome, it is not associated with the t3ss gene cluster, whereas in the genomes of xaub and xauc it is. the role of harpin-like proteins like hrpw as virulence factors or t3ss accessory proteins has not yet been determined in the xanthomonas genus. experiments will need to be performed to confirm translocation of the above putative effectors and their putative function as virulence or avirulence genes.

xac-specific genes and genomic regions with respect to xaub and xauc
we compared the xac genome to the xaub and xauc genomes both computationally and by doing experimental whole genome hybridizations. results are summarized in fig.  <dig>  the results of the two methods were consistent. in the following sections we focus on regions and genes specific to xac with respect to xaub and xauc according to these results.

we have identified  <dig> groups of at least four consecutive genes that we term xac-specific regions  . nearly all regions contain or are flanked by transposition elements or phage-related genes, suggesting that they could be the result of lateral transfer.

several genomic differences are related to biofilm formation and quorum sensing
xanthan gum is an exopolysaccharide that plays an important role in biofilm formation and hence in virulence of pathogens of the xanthomonadaceae family  <cit> . moreover, the synthesis of xanthan gum is regulated by variation in sugar concentration in the culture medium and by the activation of regulatory rpf genes  <cit> . these genes are also responsible for the synthesis of diffusible signal factors, fundamental molecules for quorum sensing processes  <cit> . both xau genomes contain an identical xanthan gum operon . the xau genomes contain gene rpfh , but this gene is not found in xac. gene rpfi, present in the xanthan gum operon of x. campestris pv. campestris strain atcc <dig>  is absent from all three cc genomes.

xac and the two xau genomes contain the xanthomonadin biosynthesis regulon as well as sugar metabolism genes. xaub however presents some important variations that may explain its in planta and in culture fastidious phenotype, when compared to both xac and xauc. differences were found in the phosphotransferase system , which specializes in internalization of fructose, and in the rpfn gene, a sugar porin, which is regulated by rpf genes, which also regulate xanthan gum synthesis  <cit> . the importance of the pts-fru system and of the sugar porin encoded by the rpfn gene for growth and pathogenicity of certain bacteria has been reported in the literature: pts-fru mutants of spiroplasma citri, causative agent of citrus stubborn disease, are reduced in virulence  <cit> , and rpfn mutants of xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris show an increase in the level of polygalacturonate lyase  <cit> , an important pathogenicity factor in bacterial plant pathogens. this result shows that the absence of the sugar porin could cause lack of carbohydrate uptake, therefore inducing the synthesis of cell wall degrading enzymes, in order to increase sugar supply  <cit> . in xac the pts system, encoded by genes frubka and rpfn, is organized in one single genomic region  . xauc presents the same organization . in xaub frubka corresponds to xaub_ <dig>  xaub_ <dig> and xaub_ <dig> respectively, but rpfn was not found. in addition, the frua gene sequence contains a frameshift, indicating that it may have become a pseudogene. xaub needs a culture medium with glutamic acid  <cit> , possibly because it is used by the bacterium as an alternative carbon source. xylella fastidiosa 9a5c, which also lacks the pts system and the rpfn gene, is also fastidious  <cit> .

experiments were carried out to compare cellular growth and xanthan gum production in all three organisms under study. results  confirm the fastidiousness of xaub, whereas xac and xauc have similar cellular mass values. we also determined that xac produces more than twice as much gum as xauc and almost three times as much as xaub. we believe this variation is due to the xaub deficiencies in the rpfn and pts-fru genes discussed above. on the other hand, this result also suggests that the lack of the rpfh and rpfi genes in xac, caused by the presence of transposition elements  <cit> , does not influence the gum production capability of xac. the fastidiousness of xaub would thus be related to the low gum production and the consequent decrease in biofilm formation together with the fact that it needs an additional substrate source  to support its growth in culture.

sd - standard deviation

in addition to the differences noted above, five additional xac-specific regions  may be related to its greater biofilm-formation capability when compared to xaub and xauc. several of the genes in these regions facilitate adhesion in a process mediated by hemagglutinin  <cit> .

xacsr <dig> contains two hemin storage system genes, hmsf and hmsh, and hemagglutinin coding genes . genes involved with acquisition and storage of hemin groups  and type i secretion system genes , and their secreted hemagglutinin , are found in tandem and flanked by a trnar in the xac genome . in yersinia pestis the hms genes are present in a cluster  related to temperature-dependent storage of hemin as well as expression of a number of other physiological characteristics  <cit> . mutations in these genes cause drastic decrease in yersinia growth, preventing it from colonizing its point of entrance in infected flies   <cit> . these genes also play a role in exopolysacharide synthesis, and reduction in biolfilm formation has also been observed in these mutants in yersinia  <cit> . among all sequenced xanthomonads only xac and x. oryzae have these genes. in both cases they are similar to  and syntenic with their homologs in yersinia, e. coli k- <dig> and erwinia carotovora .

recent work  <cit>  describing mutations in the genes that code for hemagglutinin in xylella fastidiosa strain temecula  has shown that biofilm composition and virulence  were affected in the mutants. this is consistent with results in xac  <cit> . this is evidence that the apparent absence of these genes in xaub and xauc might have the same effect .

xacsr <dig> contains  <dig> genes. one of them  is a hemolysin-related gene. in enterobacteria hemolysins are an important virulence factor that are associated with proteins related to biofilm formation  <cit> . the protein encoded by this particular gene interacts with vird <dig>  a type iv secretion system component  <cit> , which in turn may play a role in biofilm formation and cell aggregation, as observed for e. coli  <cit> .

xacsr <dig> contains several noteworthy genes. gene xac <dig> codes for the yaph protein. its homolog  in x. oryzae pv. oryzae kacc <dig> when mutated drastically reduced the pathogen adhesion to plant tissue, thus decreasing its virulence  <cit> ; in addition a homolog of this gene in x. fuscans subsp. fuscans cfbp4834-r , was required for adhesion to seed, leaves, and abiotic surfaces  <cit> . xac <dig> and xac <dig> code for hemolysin-type calcium binding proteins, whereas xac <dig> and xac <dig> code for hemolysin secretion protein d  and hemolysin secretion protein b , respectively. the latter four genes do not have xanthomonas matches in the sequence databases; they are similar instead to protein sequences from acidovorax, xylella and pseudomonas species. the best hits are from acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae atcc <dig>  which is also a plant pathogen.

xacsr <dig> contains genes related to the type iv pilus-dependent system . this system takes part in several processes, including adhesion, motility, microcolony formation, and protease secretion  <cit> . in xylella fastidiosa functional studies of these genes have shown that they are crucial for the host colonization process  <cit> .

xacsr <dig> is also related to biofilm formation. laia et al.  <cit>  observed decrease in biofilm activity and virulence in four mutants with changes in this region  . the only mutated gene with functional assignment is rhsd . this gene has been described as coding for a membrane protein related to adhesion  <cit> . in xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris a rhsd protein has been found in the outer membrane vesicle associated with other virulence-associated proteins, such as hrpa/f/x/b <dig>  hrcu, avrbs <dig> and avrbs <dig>  <cit> . xac contains a paralog of this gene , but it was not found in the xau genomes either.

gene wapa , not part of any xac-specific region, and which is an adhesion facilitator by way of hemagglutinins  <cit> , was not found in either of the xau genomes.

xaub contains t4ss gene clusters similar to those found in ralstonia solanacearum and in agrobacterium tumefaciens
in addition to the type iii secretion system, the type iv secretion system  also plays a role in pathogenicity. for example, this system has been shown to contribute to full virulence in the phytopathogen x. campestris pv. campestris strain  <dig>  <cit> . genome clusters containing t4ss genes are found in several bacterial species but with marked differences in terms of gene presence/absence and organization, which relate to the system's function in the organism where it is present  <cit> . all three genomes under study contain t4ss genes, arrayed in clusters. in order to better understand these gene clusters we have classified the t4ss genes found in the three cc genomes as well as t4ss gene clusters from other organisms into four groups, using as criteria presence/absence of genes and synteny . we have found important differences between xac and xaub using this classification; data for xauc was too fragmented to allow a similar general observation.

as reported by da silva et al.  <cit>  xac has two t4ss clusters, one in the chromosome and the other in a plasmid . in xaub we found three clusters. only one of them is similar to a xac cluster , and was therefore placed in group ii, along with the t4ss cluster found on plasmid pxcb . the other two xaub clusters were placed in groups i and iii, respectively, while the xac chromosome cluster was placed in group iv .

the xaub cluster placed in group iii is similar to a cluster found in ralstonia solanacearum  <cit> , both in terms of organization as well as individual gene sequence similarity. this organization is quite different from those found in other bacterial species. this xaub cluster is found in a region containing  <dig> genes, all of which are xaub-specific when compared to other xanthomonas genomes. moreover this cluster is flanked by insertion elements. this evidence suggests that this cluster was likely acquired by lateral transfer.

the third xaub cluster was placed in group i, which contains t4ss clusters similar to those found in agrobacterium tumefaciens c <dig> plasmid ti  <cit> , xylella fastidiosa 9a5c plasmid pxf <dig>  <cit> , and rhizosphere plasmids pipo2t and psb <dig>  <cit> . this xaub cluster is most similar to those found in the rhizosphere plasmids, in particular to pipo2t. the xauc draft genome sequence did allow the identification of one t4ss gene cluster, and it belongs to this group .

the xac chromosomal cluster belongs to group iv . it is flanked by regions xacsr <dig> and xacsr <dig> . in addition, some of the genes in this t4ss cluster had uncertain hybridizations . this adds evidence that this cluster, as a specific unit, is indeed absent from both xau genomes. xacsr <dig> contains genes that code for transporters, alpha-glucosidases, hypothetical genes and transposases, as well as a virb6-related gene. xacsr <dig> contains only hypothetical genes and transposases.

one of the members of this t4ss cluster is vird <dig> . alegria et al.  <cit>  have identified  <dig> xac proteins that interact with vird <dig>  six of these  are apparently absent from the xau genomes, and five belong to xac-specific regions . these genes might thus contribute to the increased virulence of xac when compared to xaub and xauc.

flagellum and motility
the xac genome contains all genes known to be needed for flagellum synthesis  <cit> . three of these clusters  are close to the terminus of replication and are spread out over a  <dig> kbp region . a fourth cluster contains just two genes, coding for flagellar motor proteins a and b . all four clusters are found in both xaub and xauc with one exception: in xaub we did not find cluster f <dig> , which contains  <dig> genes, coding for flagellum proteins that interact with bacterial membranes and coding for flagellar motor components . on the other hand we have observed  that xaub does have a flagellar structure similar to those of xac and xauc, and motility tests have shown that xaub is able to move . although our genome sequence data for xaub is incomplete, we believe it unlikely that a  <dig> kbp long fragment would be entirely missed; moreover, the hybridization experiment did not indicate presence of this fragment. these results suggest that the absence of genes in cluster f <dig> is compensated in xaub by other as yet undetermined genes.

we did not find in xaub nor in xauc genes that lie between clusters f <dig> and f2; this region is xacsr <dig>  in this region the gene xac <dig> has been shown to be important for citrus canker since mutations in it significantly decreased virulence  <cit>  .

lps and o-antigen genes
two of the xac-specific regions contain genes related to lipopolysaccharides  that may play a role in the differing phenotypes between xac and the two xau strains. region xacsr <dig>   is immediately downstream of a cc-specific region  . an alignment with x. campestris pv. campestris atcc <dig> shows that these two regions together occupy roughly the same genomic locus as a 25-gene region related to lps synthesis in x. campestris pv. campestris  <cit>  . immediately downstream of xacsr <dig> we find genes wzt  and wzm , also described as part of the lps synthesis cluster in x. campestris  <cit> . laia et al.  <cit>  obtained significant phenotypic differences in xac  by mutating gene xac <dig> . the wzt gene is present in both xau genomes , although both genes have lost the c-terminus when compared to the xac wzt gene . the wzm gene is also present in both xau genomes .

xacsr <dig>  contains several genes related to lps synthesis, including two copies of asnb , which codes for an asparagine synthase. a homolog of this gene in pseudomonas aeruginosa has been implicated in o-antigen biosynthesis  <cit> .

the gene xacpnp
gottig et al.  <cit>  have identified a plant natriuretic peptide-like protein in xac , encoded by gene xac <dig>  they have shown that a xac2654-deletion mutant resulted in more necrotic tissues and earlier bacterial cell death than in the wild type. xac <dig> lies between regions xacsr <dig> and xacsr <dig>  and is flanked on both sides by phage-related genes. we have experimentally verified that neither xaub nor xauc appears to contain a homolog of xac <dig> . therefore, xacpnp might be another gene contributing to the higher virulence displayed by xac as compared to xaub and xauc.

CONCLUSIONS
citrus canker continues to be an economically important disease. the publication of the xac strain  <dig> genome in  <dig> opened up new avenues of research, and several important insights into the genetics of canker have been obtained since then, most of them cited here. yet, understanding the genomic basis of a bacterial plant disease is a complex undertaking. by obtaining the genome sequences of two additional citrus canker strains we have uncovered several new clues towards a thorough understanding of this disease.

we have approached the problem from two basic perspectives. the first was to determine commonalities among the three cc strains that were not found in other xanthomonas genomes. such traits are excellent candidates for the general genomic basis of canker and/or adaptation to citrus hosts. the second was to carefully compare the three cc genomes to one another, with special attention to genes that xac has that the others  do not, as well as genes present in the xau genomes but absent in xac. because of the draft nature of the xau genomes here presented, all results concerning gene absence in their sequences are tentative. however, our hybridization platform provided additional evidence for the specificity of xac genes and regions with respect to the other two strains.

our most important findings are related to presence/absence of effector genes. in addition to the already known ptha gene, the genes xope <dig> and xopai deserve special attention in future studies. moreover, we have identified several genes  that differentiate xac from xaub and/or xauc. these genes or their homologs in other bacterial plant pathogens have demonstrated roles in virulence and/or host specificity. hypotheses on their role in citrus canker and in host range differences between cc strains can now be tested experimentally.

we anticipate that knowledge in regard to cc-specific effectors and other cc-specific genes will be used in the future to engineer citrus species with durable resistance to citrus canker, thus reducing the economic impact of this disease on the citrus industry worldwide. such knowledge will also be crucial for dealing with new canker variants that may emerge in the field, exemplified by the recent detection of what appears to be a new variant of xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolii in swingle citrumelo  <cit> .
