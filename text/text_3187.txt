BACKGROUND
during the development of the nervous system neurons respond to attractive and repulsive guidance cues to navigate to their final targets  <cit> . the nine mammalian plexins, a1– <dig>  b1– <dig>  c <dig>  and d <dig>  <cit>  are characterized by a sema domain, three cysteine-rich repeats , three glycine/proline-rich repeats , a single-pass transmembrane region, and an intracellular sp  domain consisting of two different parts  <cit> . plexins are known as semaphorin receptors  <cit> . molecules associated with plexins in receptor complexes include cell adhesion molecule l <dig>  the scatter factor receptors met and ron, erbb- <dig>  otk, and vegfr <dig>  <cit> . interactions have been shown between plexin c <dig> and semaphorin 7a  <cit> , plexin d <dig> and semaphorin 3e  <cit> , plexin b <dig> and semaphorin 4d  <cit> , and plexin b <dig> and semaphorin 5a  <cit> . semaphorin 5a induces growth cone collapse in retinal ganglion cells, has axon-repelling activity  <cit> , induces cellular collapse, and leads to inhibition of integrin-based adhesion of nih-3t <dig> fibroblasts expressing recombinant plexin b <dig>  <cit> . the cytoplasmic c-terminus of b plexins activates rho gtpase through rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors pdz-rhogef and larg  <cit> . based on this c-terminal interaction, plexin b <dig> mediates semaphorin 4d-induced growth cone collapse in neurons  <cit> . independently of this mechanism, a direct down regulation of the activity of neurite outgrowth-promoting gtpase r-ras by the gtpase activating protein -homologous domain of plexin b <dig> has been shown  <cit> . thus, according to published data, plexins appear to be mainly involved in the repulsive activities of semaphorins on neuronal cells.

we found evidence for plexin b3- and b2-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth, subtype-specific homophilic interaction of b <dig> and b <dig>  respectively, and an interaction of b <dig> with neuron-specific gtpase rin, the latter one known for its involvement in neurite outgrowth.

RESULTS
expression and alternative splicing of plxnb3
northern blot analysis of  <dig> different human organs  revealed a strong band of ~ <dig>  kb from the brain sample but not the remaining organs, indicating that plxnb <dig> is expressed abundantly only in brain. the estimated size of the mrna corresponds well with that of the mature message predicted from the cloned full-length human cdna . blastn screening of human dbest by af <dig> revealed  <dig> fully matching entries, all of them representing the 3'-end of the transcript and two variants. est  from oligodendroglioma lacks  <dig> nucleotides of exon  <dig>  corresponding to bp  <dig> – <dig>  of af <dig>  this gap predicts an in-frame loss of  <dig> codons . est  from adult brain lacks the  <dig> 3'-terminal nucleotides of exon  <dig> . this gap predicts a c-terminally truncated isoform of b <dig> due to a frame-shift resulting in the inclusion of nine amino acids  followed by a premature stop. these findings suggest alternative splicing and the existence of at least three different b3-isoforms due to skipping of various parts of exon  <dig>  differential expression of the three isoforms in human organs was confirmed by pcr using isoform-specific primers. as shown in figure 1c the full-length exon 27-isoform was detectable in the majority of the organs analyzed but skeletal muscle and heart. cdna of the truncated isoform was detectable only in the brain , whereas the isoform lacking  <dig> codons was present in skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, kidney, brain, and heart . the structures of full length b <dig> and the two different isoforms are shown in figure 1f–h.

analysis of recombinantly expressed and cerebral plexin b <dig> protein
conceptual translation of plxnb <dig> cdna  predicts a protein of  <dig>  aa with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda and an isoelectric point of  <dig> . western blot  analysis of proteins from cos- <dig> cells stably overexpressing full-length b <dig> and from human neocortex  using antibody pabb3-b against the third ipt-domain of human b <dig> revealed bands of ~ <dig> kda and ~ <dig> kda that were absent in nontransfected control cells . antibody pabb3-a against the human sema domain of b <dig> only detected the  <dig> kda band . taken together, these data suggest proteolytic processing of the extracellular portion of b <dig> similar to that described for plexins b <dig> and b <dig>  <cit> . within the extracellular domains of b <dig> flanked by the epitopes of pabb3-a and pabb3-b there are two rxxr sites corresponding to the minimal consensus motif required by proprotein convertases. cleavage at one of these sites would remove the sema domain leaving the truncated transmembrane part of b <dig> not recognizable by pabb3-a. pabb3-b did not cross-react with plexins b <dig>  b <dig>  or a <dig> expressed in cos- <dig> cells and was therefore also useful for the analysis of co-immunoprecipitation of b <dig> with these molecules . mouse b <dig> was detected by wb analysis of adult murine brain lysate using antibody pabmb <dig> against the sema domain of mouse b <dig> . pabmb <dig> detected bands of ~ <dig> kda, ~ <dig> kda, and ~ <dig> kda. this suggests posttranslational processing of murine b <dig> similar or analogous to that of human b <dig>  minor differences in band patterns between the murine and the human wb may be due to the different epitopes recognized by the antibodies. pabmb <dig> also recognized c-terminally truncated mouse b <dig> expressed in pcdna/mb3v5-transfected cos- <dig> cells used as positive control . b <dig> has ten potential n-glycosylation sites . the  <dig> kda protein detected by pabb3-b in human brain  was resistant to endoh treatment  yielding a distinct band of ~ <dig> kda in addition to a novel band running at ~200– <dig> kda. the latter one suggests the presence of incompletely processed b <dig> non-resistant to endoh in the transfected cells. treatment with tunicamycin resulted in a relatively reduced intensity of the  <dig> kda band and the appearance of a novel band of ~ <dig> kda. these data suggest that the  <dig> kda band corresponds to deglycosylated full-length b <dig>  whereas the  <dig> kda band represents fully glycosylated, mature, full-length transmembraneous b <dig> supposed to be located at the cell surface. this was confirmed by exclusive detection of a sharp band of a biotinylated  <dig> kda protein after pabb3-b-immunoprecipitation of surface-biotinylated protein of stably transfected cos- <dig> cells . as shown by immunocytochemistry of living cells stably expressing full-length b <dig> , a significant proportion of b <dig> is detectable at the cell surface.

b <dig> stimulates neurite outgrowth
we analyzed the effects of recombinant b <dig> and b <dig> expressed by nih-3t <dig> substrate cells on neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons of six days old c57bl/6j mice. polyclonal nih-3t <dig> cells stably expressing recombinant human l <dig>  <cit>   served as a positive control substrate. polyclonal nih-3t <dig> cells, negative for plxnb <dig> and plxnb <dig> cdna in rt-pcr , express at comparable levels recombinant human b <dig> or b <dig> at the cell surface after stable transfection using the respective full-length expression constructs pflag/b <dig> or pires/b <dig> . cells expressing b <dig> displayed increased cell adhesive properties to surfaces and a more flattened cell shape. no such changes were observed in the cells expressing recombinant b <dig>  non-transfected nih-3t <dig> cells, known to stimulate neurite outgrowth only moderately  <cit> , were used as negative substrate control. as suggested by the examples shown in figure 6a and shown in figure 6b and 6c, both plexins stimulate neurite outgrowth. mean outgrowth stimulation through b3-positive substrate cells was significantly higher than that through l <dig> that in turn showed a higher stimulation than b <dig>  mean neurite length differed significantly between all groups . mean length  of neurites of neurons grown on nontransfected cells was  <dig> μm ± 30; mean neurite length of neurons grown on cells expressing b <dig>  l <dig>  or b <dig> was  <dig> μm ±  <dig>   <dig> μm ±  <dig>  and  <dig> μm ±  <dig>  the neurites of the outgrowth experiments revealed similarly shaped size distribution curves .

ca2+/mg2+-dependent b3-homophilic interaction in trans promotes cell adhesion
primary cerebellar neurons , but not astrocytes  or oligodendrocytes  of six days old mice grown under selective conditions express plxnb <dig>  suggesting the possibility that neuronally expressed b <dig> may be involved in mediation of the b3-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth. to determine the in vivo expression of plxnb <dig>  we performed in situ hybridization  in adult mouse cerebellum using two different probes covering nucleotides  <dig>  –  <dig>   or  <dig>  –  <dig>  like the probe used by worzfeld et al.  <cit>  . with both probes, strongest labeling was observed in cerebellar neurons, i.e. purkinje and granular cells. immunohistochemistry  of adult human cerebellum using antibody pabb3-b also revealed staining of purkinje and granular cells . furthermore, murine and human b <dig> co-immunoprecipitate . this allowed us to hypothesize that homophilic interaction of b <dig> and possibly also that of b <dig> may underlie the b3- and b2-specific stimulation of neurite outgrowth, respectively.

in order to investigate the possibility of homophilic interaction, we performed cell aggregation assays using transfected nih-3t <dig> cells stably expressing b <dig> or b <dig>  transfected cells expressing l <dig> and non-transfected cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively. b3-, b2-, and l1-expressing cells were stained with dii  and mixed 1: <dig> with non-transfected cells stained with dio . aggregates of non-transfected dii-stained cells mixed 1: <dig> with dio-stained ones were composed of approximately equal proportions of dii- and dio-labeled cells . in contrast, there was strong predominance of dii-stained b3-expressing cells  in the aggregates as shown in figure 9b, indicating an enhanced aggregation due to homophilic interaction of b <dig> in trans. similar results were obtained with cells expressing l <dig>  and to a smaller extent also for those expressing b <dig> . furthermore, dii-stained l1-expressing cells  were mixed 1: <dig> with dio-stained b3-expressing ones ; the almost monochrome green and red aggregates indicate specific and preferential homotypic interactions of both l <dig> and b <dig> , respectively. as further negative control for the aggregation assay cells expressing b <dig> , l <dig>  or b <dig>  labeled alternatively with dio or dii were mixed 1: <dig>  respectively; all aggregates were composed of approximately equal proportions of dii- and dio-labeled cells.

time dependent aggregation of cells expressing b <dig> was moderately enhanced, whereas that of cells expressing b <dig> or l <dig> was strongly enhanced . after  <dig> min aggregation time the number of particles decreased by 79%, 76%, 64%, and 52% in l1-, b3-, b <dig>  and non-transfected cells, respectively . as shown in figures 10b and 10c, absence of divalent cations abolishes completely both b2- and b3-dependent but not l1-dependent aggregation, the latter one known to be independent of divalent cations  <cit> .

homophilic interaction of b <dig> is mediated by the sema domain
homophilic binding of b <dig> was further analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation  of full-length b <dig> and several deletion mutants . homophilic binding of full-length b <dig> was shown by anti-myc ip of lysates of cells co-transfected with expression constructs pegfp-n1/b <dig> encoding egfp-tagged and psectag2b/b <dig> encoding myc-tagged full-length b <dig>  followed by detection with anti-egfp antibodies . full-length b <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with deletion mutants containing the sema domain alone or lacking the intracytoplasmic part of b <dig>  but not with those lacking both the sema domain and the intracytoplasmic part . in addition, v5-tagged sema domain  co-immunoprecipitates with ha-tagged sema domain . these data indicate that the sema domain is both essential and sufficient for homophilic binding. similarly, full-length human b <dig>  co-immunoprecipitates with mouse b <dig> lacking most of its intracellular part . this supports the assumption that a quasi homophilic interaction of human and murine b <dig> in trans may underlie the observed b3-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth. full-length b <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with its known  <cit>  ligand semaphorin 5a ; ip of lysates of cells co-expressing b <dig> and plexins a <dig>  b <dig>  or b <dig> revealed no evidence for heterophilic interaction of b <dig> with these molecules .

rin, an intracellular interaction partner of b3
in order to determine which intracellular signaling pathways may be involved in b <dig> dependent neurite outgrowth, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens using the sos-recruitment system . psos fusion constructs of the intracellular parts of b <dig>  and b <dig>  expressed in cdc25h cells served as bait and pmyr fusion constructs of human fetal brain library cdnas as prey molecules. putative positive clones were used for re-transformation of cdc25h cells together with psos/b3ic or psos/b2ic, or psos vector without insert. only those clones were defined positive in which co-expression of the bait was essential in order to restore cell growth at 37°c on galactose. these experiments suggested an interaction between b <dig> and rin  , a small gtp-binding protein belonging to the ras superfamily of gtpases. for b <dig>  no interaction partner could be identified with this system and no interaction with rin could be demonstrated . three independent cdnas containing the complete coding region of rin were obtained by repeated yeast two-hybrid screens. rin co-transfected with psos-vector without insert was not able to induce growth on galactose at 37°c , showing that rin does not activate the system unspecifically. correspondingly, b <dig> and rin could be co-immunoprecipitated from cos- <dig> cells transiently co-transfected with pflag/rin and pires/b <dig> . rin did not co-immunprecipitate with b <dig> .

cos- <dig> cells transiently overexpressing b <dig> and rin were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . in line with previous findings  <cit> , rin-specific immunofluorescence was enhanced at the plasma membrane and the nucleus of both transfected cos- <dig> cells . co-localization of b <dig> and rin could be demonstrated at plasma membrane-associated sites .

discussion
using a neurite outgrowth assay with murine cerebellar neurons and substrate cells expressing recombinant human plexins b <dig> or b <dig>  we found evidence of neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of both plexins. up to now, in the nervous system plexins were known to act as receptors involved in repulsion and growth cone collapse. the observed stimulation of neurite outgrowth by human plexins b <dig> and b <dig> could not be explained by the mechanisms known so far for b-plexins. for xenopus plexin, homophilic interaction in trans has been described  <cit> . homophilic interaction of various neuronal transmembrane proteins, including molecules involved primarily in repulsion, has been implicated in stimulation of neurite outgrowth. therefore, we hypothesized that homophilic interaction of plexins b <dig> and b <dig> may underlie the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of both plexins. using cell aggregation assays and immunoprecipitation we found evidence of human b2- and b3-specific homophilic interaction in trans. furthermore, human and murine b <dig> co-immunoprecipitated, and we could show expression of plxnb <dig> in cultured murine cerebellar neurons. there seemed to be a correlation between plexin-dependent cell aggregation, adhesion, and neurite outgrowth stimulation, as b <dig>  compared to b <dig>  had a stronger effect on all features. these data, along with the fact that homophilic interaction of various neuronal cams has been implicated in stimulation of neurite outgrowth  <cit> , support the hypothesis that homophilic interaction of b <dig> and also possibly that of b <dig> is involved in stimulation of neurite outgrowth and that in the assay presented both human plexins may stimulate neurite outgrowth of murine cerebellar neurons via a quasi homophilic interaction of the human and murine homologs. however, a reverse signaling mechanism in which b <dig> would act as a ligand for a yet unknown receptor cannot be ruled out as an explanation for the observed b3-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth. such a reverse signaling mechanism has been described for semaphorin 6d / plexin a <dig> in cardiac development  <cit> .

for plxnb <dig>  both glial and neuronal expression have been demonstrated  <cit> . using combined in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, we found plxnb <dig> mrna in cultured primary cerebellar neurons of six days old mice. plxnb <dig> mrna was also detected in adult murine cerebellum and we observed prominent neuronal b3-specific immunostaining in adult human cerebellum. therefore, homophilic interaction of b <dig> is supposed to be a possible mechanism underlying the stimulation of neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons in the assay presented. the new ish-probe used in this work and the probe used by cheng et al.  <cit> , both cover major parts of the 3'-utr of plxnb <dig>  probes hybridizing more upstream appear to detect a lower level of neuronal and a more pronounced non-neuronal expression of plxnb <dig>  <cit> . we also found in addition to neuronal staining a non-neuronal staining pattern using the same probe as worzfeld et al.  <cit> . these data suggest the existence of cell-type specific isoforms of b <dig> with different 3'-ends of the mrna. in human organs we found evidence for the expression of such isoforms. however, in mouse est database  the 3'-end of plxnb <dig> transcripts is strongly overrepresented with more upstream sequences represented very scarcely thus not allowing the rapid detailed analysis of tissue-specific expression of b <dig> isoforms.

b <dig> is a known receptor of semaphorin 5a that induces cellular collapse, growth cone collapse, has axon-repelling activity, and leads to inhibition of integrin-based adhesion of nih-3t <dig> fibroblasts expressing transfected plexin b <dig>  <cit> . our findings of both b3- and b2-associated cell aggregation and stimulation of neurite outgrowth suggest the possibility that plexins b <dig> and b <dig>  via homophilic interaction, respectively, are also involved in signaling pathways independent of semaphorins. the sema domain of semaphorins contains a plexin interaction site  <cit> . by immunoprecipitation of various deletion constructs we showed that the sema domain of b <dig> was necessary and sufficient for the homophilic interaction. since b <dig> does not co-immunoprecipitate with plexins a <dig>  b <dig>  or b <dig>  and since b3-positive cells do not aggregate with l1-positive cells, the homophilic interaction seems to be highly specific. therefore, the sema domain of b <dig> may be involved in both homophilic interaction and heterophilic interaction with semaphorin 5a. under the experimental conditions presented for homophilic co-ip of recombinant b <dig>  b <dig> also co-immunoprecipitates with semaphorin 5a. since recombinant b <dig> and semaphorin 5a were co-expressed in the cells used for these experiments and semaphorin 5a could be co-immunoprecipitated by b <dig> despite its strong homophilic trans-interaction, both homophilic and heterophilic interactions of b <dig> may co-exist in vivo. although the sema domain of b <dig> seems to be involved in both types of interaction, it is not clear whether semaphorin 5a and plexin b <dig> compete directly for b <dig> binding, whether different co-receptors are involved, and which signal transduction pathways are triggered by the different types of interaction.

b <dig> may be a multifunctional player in cell adhesion and both neurite outgrowth and repulsion, possibly due to competing ligands inducing "opposite" effects on neuronal morphology. there is a growing number of cams showing bifunctional characteristics with respect to involvement of homophilic interaction in stimulation of neurite outgrowth, neuronal attraction, migration, or axonal fasciculation, and heterophilic interactions in various functions including repulsion and growth cone collapse. a prominent example is represented by l <dig>  known for its strong stimulation of neurite outgrowth in association with its homophilic binding  <cit>  and also involved in semaphorin 3a mediated repulsion of cortical axons as part of a heteromultimeric receptor complex including plexin a <dig> and neuropilin  <dig>  <cit> . the roundabout  receptor, a transmembrane glycoprotein sharing structural homology with a number of neuronal cams of the immunoglobulin  superfamily, is receptor for slit, an extracellular matrix protein. slit controls midline crossing of axons by inducing growth cone repulsion upon interaction with robo  <cit> . on the other hand, homophilic trans-interaction of robo promotes cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth  <cit> , most likely reflecting robo's known role in selective axon fasciculation. the majority of the known cams which show involvement of homophilic interaction in stimulation of neurite outgrowth or neuronal migration contain ig  or cadherin domains; these cams include l <dig>  ncam, robo <dig>  robo <dig>  fasciclin ii, lamp, dm-grasp, n-cadherin, and celsr <dig>  <cit> . currently, the number of known cams with homophilic binding and neurite outgrowth stimulating characteristics is rapidly growing, with an increasing variety of molecular features not shared by igs, fibronectins, or cadherins, as e.g. the amigos or ninjurins  <cit> . our work shows that b <dig> and suggests that also b <dig> belong to this latter group, adding further molecular heterogeneity to the group of homophilic cams with neurite outgrowth stimulating capacity.

searching for intracellular pathways involved in the b2- and b3-dependent neurite outgrowth using the intracellular parts of b <dig> and b <dig> as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of human fetal brain cdna we identified rin, a neuron-specific and calmodulin-binding ras-related gtpase, as interaction partner for b <dig>  <cit> . an interaction between b <dig> and rin in mammalian cells  could be shown by co-immunoprecipitation of recombinant b <dig> and rin expressed in cos- <dig> cells in which co-localization of these proteins at plasma membrane-associated sites could be shown by confocal laser scanning microscopy. therefore, one may assume physiological interaction of b <dig> and rin as part of a neuronal receptor complex involved in b3-dependent signaling. expression of recombinant rin induces neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma pc <dig> cells and rin interacts with the transcription factor brn-3a, which is known to regulate different genes involved in neuronal differentiation and survival  <cit> . if the homophilic interaction of b <dig> is responsible for b3-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth one may speculate therefore that rin may be involved in this process. since rin and b <dig> do not interact in yeast or mammalian cells, this interaction seems to be specific for b <dig> and other mechanisms seem to be involved in b2-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth. the rin-interacting intracellular subdomain of b <dig> remains to be identified. this may help to elucidate how plexins may be involved in common and subtype-specific intracellular signaling pathways  <cit> .

further experiments are required to investigate whether homophilic interaction of b <dig> or b <dig> is responsible for the observed stimulation of neurite outgrowth, or whether these plexins function as heterophilic ligands of yet unknown neuronal receptors in a reverse signaling mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest an involvement of the homophilic interaction of plexin b <dig> in stimulation of neurite outgrowth. the neuron-specific small gtpase rin, known for its neurotrophic characteristics, was identified as intracellular interaction partner of b <dig>  therefore, both, neuronally and non-neuronally expressed plexin b <dig> may be involved in semaphorin-independent signaling positively influencing neuritogenesis.
