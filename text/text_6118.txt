BACKGROUND
the genome complexity of higher eukaryotes is revealed by a high proportion of non-coding for proteins regulatory elements, of which a class of processed long non-coding rna  is attracting increasing attention. the lncrnas are highly heterogeneous transcripts in length, varying from  <dig> bp to tens of thousands of nucleotides. they pervasively distribute in genomes, not only in intron and intergenic region, but also in some antisense transcripts, pseudogenes and retrotransposons  <cit> . lncrnas have lower level of sequence conservation than protein-coding mrnas  <cit> . they were originally considered as transcriptional by-products or “expression noise” of protein coding genes and were often dismissed in analyses of transcriptome  <cit> , however recent studies uncovered the increasing body of evidences that lncrnas strictly regulated and played important roles in biological process of organisms  <cit> .

recently, a great number of lncrnas had been identified in animals and humans . they participated in numerous biological processes, such as x-chromosome inactivation  <cit> , and human diseases , although only a few of them have been functionally annotated. compared with researches about lncrnas in animals and humans, studies on plants are relatively infrequent, and only restrict to some model plants, such as arabidopsis, rice, maize, and populus . most of the annotated lncrnas are related with regulation of the development of plants.

lncrnas are found to be differentially expressed between different organs, development stage and environment. the fact that lncrnas are expressed in a strong state-specific manner was revealed by the recent analyses of lncrnas expression under abiotic stress conditions . thus it is reasonable to identify the lncrnas associated with stressful environment by comparing the lncrna expression pattern across environments. indeed, the identified differentially expressed lncrnas during abiotic stress had suggested the important role of lncrnas in plant stress response  <cit> . to date, some powdery mildew infection and heat stress-responsive lncrnas were identified in wheat  <cit> , and some lncrnas induced by drought, high salt, cold, and abscisic acid were identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . these studies provide us a good starting point of understanding the role of lncrnas in the process of abiotic stress tolerance in plants  <cit> .

although several studies have identified plant lncrnas that are activated under various environmental conditions, only a few of them have been characterized in population under field condition. due to the low level of expression frequency and strong state-specific expression manner of lncrnas, only a limited number of lncrnas can be identified using rna-seq for a few samples, and the components that are important in specific condition may been overlooked. genome and population wide approaches could provide a larger scale of lncrnas identification and a broader picture of the role of lncrnas as regulators of the massive protein coding genes responding to stress under field environment.

with markedly accelerated consumption of fossil energy and its worsening environmental impact, the development of energy crops to provide renewable feedstock for clean energy and safe material offers an appealing solution to the sustainability problems facing the society  <cit> . the extent to which this can solve the problem depends heavily on whether the crops can be produced in large scales without threat to the food security and at little cost of natural ecosystem function  <cit> . a promising candidate of dedicated energy crops meeting these requirements is miscanthus  <cit> , a group of c <dig> perennial grasses capable of producing high biomass on marginal land  <cit> . the challenge now becomes whether and how the new crop can adapt to meet environmental requirements. the integration of population genetics and new genomic technologies holds a great potential to meet the challenge.

of more than a dozen wild miscanthus species, m. lutarioriparius that produces the highest biomass stood out as a desirable wild progenitor for crop adaptation. fourteen populations of m. lutarioriparius were collected across the distributional range of this endemic species in central china and were planted in two experimental fields in  <dig>  one located aside its native habitat in jiangxia of the hubei province  and the other located in qingyang of the gansu province  in the loess plateau  <cit> . loess plateau, one of the most seriously eroded regions of the world, possesses remarkably large area of marginal land for producing second-generation energy crops such as miscanthus  <cit> . it has been shown that m. lutarioriparius was not only able to establish in qg but also to produce higher biomass than in jh, while the annual precipitation and temperature is nearly two-third and 10-degree lower in qg than in jh .

in this study, we used population rna-seq data to identify lncrnas in miscanthus leaves and to investigate their roles in adaptation to environmental change. here, we obtained a comprehensive list of  <dig>  lncrnas. systematic expression analysis revealed that the expression of lncrnas displayed more variation than protein coding mrnas. integrating with our published datasets of water use efficiency   <cit> , we highlighted potential contributions of lncrnas to improve wue and adaptation to environmental change.

RESULTS
de novo assembly and identification of putative lncrnas
we performed rna-seq to investigate  <dig> individuals of miscanthus transcriptomes. non-directional paired-end rna-seq was carried out and ~ <dig>  billion  <dig> bp paired-end reads were generated after quality control. population transcripts were assembled using the pipeline popart which combined multiple kmers and multiple individuals  <cit> . totally we obtained  <dig>  transcripts, out of which  <dig>  unique mrnas from the  <dig> individuals were identified by blasting against the latest annotation of transcriptome references of close related species including sorghum bicolor, zea mays, oryza sativa, and brachypodium distachyon. to identify lncrnas, we used coding potential calculator software to evaluate the protein-coding potential for transcripts longer than  <dig> bp  <cit> , and transcripts with the evidence of protein-coding potential were discarded. all the remaining transcripts were aligned against rfam database to discriminate lncrnas from previously annotated mirna, rrna, or other small noncoding rna transcripts  <cit> . to obtain a more reliable data of lncrnas and a better comparison between two environments, we discarded the lncrna candidates that expressed in less than  <dig> individuals out of the  <dig> individuals. under this criterion, a total of  <dig>  putative lncrnas were remained. this amount was similar to that of lncrnas in arabidopsis, rice and maize  <cit> .

the lengths of lncrnas ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, the majority  of which were around 200– <dig> bp . the length of lncrna was  <dig> bp in average and  <dig> bp in median, respectively, which was longer than those in arabidopsis  <cit> . the length of protein coding mrnas was 1601bp in average and 1425bp in average respectively. lncrnas were significantly shorter than mrnas in length . in addition, gc content for lncrnas and mrnas were 46% and 51% in median, respectively. the lncrnas showed significant lower gc content than mrnas . in order to examine whether these candidate lncrnas sequence assembly were reliable,  <dig> lncrnas were randomly selected and validated by full-length pcr experiments. pcr results showed that the sequence identity ranged from 94% to 100% compared with the reference sequences assembled from population data . as the reference sequences of these lncrnas were assembled from the population transcriptome data, there could be some single nucleotide polymorphisms or indels . for example, the sequence of lncrna_mlulr <dig> by pcr method has an 84bp deletion compared with the reference sequence derived from with rna-seq, which may be due to an alternative splicing of this individual or a chimera between two similar lncrnas in the assembling data. in general, the results suggested a high quality assembly of the lncrnas and they could be used for further analysis.fig.  <dig> sequence characterization of lncrnas compared with mrnas. a the distribution of sequence length. b the distribution of gc content





higher expression diversity of lncrnas compared with that of mrnas within and across environments
we first set out to characterize the global expression pattern of lncrnas in jh and qg. the expression level of lncrnas in population  was calculated. then, the expression levels of lncrnas and those of protein coding mrnas were compared. it was found that e
ps of lncrnas in qg shifted significantly toward to lower levels, suggesting an overall depression of lncrnas expression from jh to qg. the change of lncrnas expression between two environments was examined by e
p ratios of qg to jh for each lncrna, and it was found that the resulting distribution of log <dig> deviated significantly from  <dig> and skewed toward bottom , indicating that lncrnas decreased expression level in qg. compared with protein coding mrnas, lncrnas had significantly lower e
p ratios . meanwhile, lncrnas had a wider range of e
p ratios than that of protein coding mrnas .fig.  <dig> boxplot of log <dig> of lncrnas and mrnas. e
p ratio was calculated with e

to evaluate and compare population variation of lncrnas expression within and between environments, we calculated and compared expression diversity  between jh and qg. compared with protein coding mrnas, lncrnas had significantly higher e
d in both environments . moreover, the distributions of e
d of lncrnas were compared between two environments, and the result showed that e
d were significantly higher in qg than in jh with  <dig> % of e
ds being elevated in qg . the significant differentiation was also detected by e
d ratios between jh and qg for each lncrna, and log <dig> of lncrnas were compared with  <dig>  and the distribution of log <dig> significantly deviated from  <dig> and skewed toward top . in addition, the e
d ratios of lncrnas were significantly higher than protein coding mrnas . the higher expression diversity of lncrnas may suggest a relaxed expression regulation compared with protein coding mrnas.fig.  <dig> expression diversity of lncrnas compared with mrnas. a boxplot of expression diversity of lncrnas and mrnas in jh and qg. b boxplot of log <dig> of lncrnas and mrnas. e

to evaluate the expression variation of lncrnas in the population, we measured the expression frequency for each lncrna in two environments. it was found that lncrnas expressed at significantly lower frequency than protein coding mrnas in both environments . expression frequency in qg showed a lower level than jh for both lncrnas and mrnas , suggesting an overall decrease of both lncrnas and mrna expression frequency from jh to qg. the change of lncrnas and mrnas expression frequency between two environments was examined by difference of qg to jh for each lncrna and mrna, respectively. it was found that lncrnas had a broader range of the difference than mrnas . the lower level and larger difference of expression frequency for lncrnas might suggest the loosen expression regulation compared with protein coding mrnas.fig.  <dig> expression frequency of lncrnas in population compared with mrnas. a boxplot of expression frequency of lncrnas and mrnas in population in jh and qg. b boxplot of the change of expression frequency of lncrnas and mrnas from jh to qg. c boxplot of the number of individuals that expressed lncrnas in jh and qg. boxplot was used for visualization purpose. d the number of lncrnas that expressed in jh with different individuals




differential expression of lncrnas in environment responsive regulation
emerging evidences showed that lncrnas participate in stress responsive regulation when plants are in the face of stressful environment  <cit> , thus we analyzed the differential expression and variation of lncrnas between the two environments. first, we plotted the number of individuals in which lncrna expressed between two environments . only  <dig>  of the  <dig> lncrnas expressed in all individuals , and only  <dig> out of the  <dig> individuals could be detected the lncrna expression in median , suggesting the specific and differential expression manner of lncrnas in our population. specially, it was found that  <dig> and  <dig> lncrnas were detected only in qg and jh , respectively. these newly arisen lncrnas in those regions or environment-specific lncrnas may be related with environmental adaptation. it was also possible that they just lost from the other region and had no function. in addition, except the low frequency of lncrnas which expressed in less than  <dig> individuals in jh, the expression frequency of lncrnas between  <dig> environments was positively correlated , suggesting that most of these lncrnas expressed at robust or similar expression frequency between environment, and also suggesting the accuracy of the estimation of lncrnas expression.

on the other hand, the differentially expressed genes between two sites were tested to identify candidate genes responding to environmental stress. the expression level changes  of  <dig>  lncrnas between two environments were calculated. the magnitude of fold change  in the expression level of lncrnas under new environment was observed between − <dig> to  <dig>  . we obtained a total of  <dig>  lncrnas that were over 2- fold up- or down- regulated with fdrs less than  <dig> , including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated lncrnas . because genes with substantially increased expression diversity in new stress environment qg could have increased phenotypic variation upon which natural and artificial selection could act to improve adaptability of the miscanthus species, we also calculated the expression diversity changes  of lncrnas between two environments for lncrnas. the magnitude of fold change in the expression diversity of lncrnas under stress condition ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . a total of  <dig> stress responsive lncrnas with e
d ratio of more than 2-fold change were obtained. these lncrnas may have higher potential in regulation of genes expression for contribution to adaptation.

to validate the reliability of the expression level, quantitative real-time pcr  was performed to assay the accuracy of the rna-seq by using  <dig> individuals from each field site for  <dig> lncrnas which were differentially expressed between two environments. the relative quantitation of expression levels which was calculated using  <dig> –ΔΔct method was compared with the fpkm values in rna-seq data in each sample  . it was found that the relative expression levels determined by the two methods were significantly correlated except for lncrna_mlulr <dig> which had outlier value in  <dig> samples . the results confirmed that the relative gene expression levels were reliable and could be used for further analysis.fig.  <dig> expression level correlation between rna-seq and qpcr for  <dig> lncrnas . each of the lncrna name was shown on the top of figure. the x-axis denotes the fpkm value quantified by rna-seq, while the y-axis shows the relative expression value obtained by qpcr. positive correlation between fpkm values of rna-seq and the relative expression value of qpcr indicate a consistent estimation of the relative expression levels between the two methods. the r value in the graphs indicates the correlation coefficient. ** represents the significant level . sequences of qpcr primers are given in additional file  <dig>  black and red dots represent individuals sampled from near native site jh and the transplanted site qg, respectively




functions of differentially expressed lncrnas based on lncrna-mrna co-expression network
in order to explore the correlation of lncrnas and mrnas, we used the transcripts with e
d more than  <dig>  to perform pairwise correlation. in total,  <dig>  lncrna-mrna pairs in both environments had the correlation coefficient of more than  <dig>  , which included  <dig>  mrnas and  <dig>  lncrnas, respectively. these lncrna-mrna expression pairs which would represent the consensus or robust relationship between environments were constructed, and the max number of node was  <dig> for mrnas and  <dig> for lncrnas. these results suggested that lncrnas in the robust relationship may play more pivotal roles in the process of regulation network. in addition, there were  <dig>  lncrna-mrna pairs having the correlation coefficient of more than  <dig>  in qg but smaller than  <dig>  in jh. similarly, there were  <dig>  lncrna-mrna pairs having the correlation coefficient of more than  <dig>  in jh but smaller than  <dig>  in qg. these differentially co-expressed lncrna-mrna pairs may involve in environment-specific regulation .table  <dig> pairwise number of lncrna-mrna co-expression in the two environments




the environmental-specific lncrna-mrna co-expression network between two environments can be used to identify key lncrnas responding to environmental change. as genes with increased expression diversity in new environment may be relevant with adaptation, we filtered out  <dig> lncrnas and  <dig> mrnas with e
d ratio larger than  <dig> . finally  <dig>  <dig> lncrna-mrna pairs with spearman correlation coefficients larger than  <dig> , including  <dig>  <dig> mrnas and  <dig>  <dig> lncrnas , were identified for network construction. the similar amount of lncrnas and mrnas potentially responding to environmental change suggested that lncrnas may play the roles as important as mrnas in environmental adaptation. two sub-networks containing  <dig> lncrnas and  <dig> mrnas with lncrna-mrna connection degree more than  <dig> were presented in detail . out of the two sub networks,  <dig> and  <dig> lncrnas were found to be up-regulated and down-regulated respectively, while  <dig> and  <dig> mrnas were up-regulated and down-regulated respectively. our network showed that one lncrna could co-express with multiple mrnas and one mrna could be correlated with multiple lncrnas. the network implied a complex relationship between lncrnas and mrnas.fig.  <dig>

to reveal potential functions of the identified lncrnas, we analyzed gene ontology  terms and families of protein coding mrna genes associated with the stress-responsive lncrnas due to their regulating roles . we detected significant enrichments of  <dig> families with more than  <dig> members and  <dig> go terms in leaves under stressful environment. for examples, we found  <dig> categories of genes that protein kinase domain, ring finger domain, cytochrome p <dig>  wd domain, g-beta repeat had more than  <dig> members . based on the functional categories from the pfam domain annotations, nine of the  <dig> protein coding mrnas in the two sub-networks were found to be related with stress response .table  <dig> the enrichments of families of the protein-coding genes identified by the environmental-specific lncrna-mrna co-expression network




identification of key lncrnas regulating water use efficiency 
previous genome-wide association studies found hundreds of lncrnas containing trait-associated snps, suggesting the putative contributions of lncrnas to agricultural traits  <cit> , and we had identified  <dig> candidate genes whose expression were related with wue in our previous study  <cit> . to find out and reveal the potential contribution of lncrnas to wue, we analyzed co-expression of lncrnas and mrnas using spearman correlation coefficient for each candidate gene of wue, and constructed the wue-lncrna-mrna co-expression network . as a result, this co-expression network contained a total of  <dig> candidate genes,  <dig> unique lncrnas and  <dig> edges . the degree of the candidate genes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  indicating that each of these genes associated with adaptation was regulated by complex network involving multiple lncrnas. we further filtered the co-expression network with more than five nodes for lncrnas . nine lncrnas and  <dig> candidate genes for wue were remained. and the remained  <dig> candidate genes for wue were mainly functioned in abiotic stress responses, photosynthesis and stomatal regulation . of the  <dig> lncrnas,  <dig> and  <dig> lncrnas were up-regulated and down-regulated between two environments,respectively . we inferred that they may represent hub genes or regulators in wue related pathway and played an important role in responding to environmental changes.fig.  <dig>

discussion
the reliability of lncrnas identification
since de novo assembly is disadvantaged by its inability to account for incidents of structural alterations of mrna transcripts, such as alternative splicing, de novo assembly of lncrnas reference without a known genome faces even more huge difficulties due to lack of sequence conservation  <cit> . here we reported population transcriptome-wide identification of lncrnas with high reliability. we substantially improved the accuracy of the m. lutarioriparius lncrnas assembly. first, we perform multiple assemblies with various kmer lengths, which could reach the best trade-off between the length and quantity of transcripts  <cit> . in addition, we used population transcriptome data to retain the best part of each one to form the final assembly  <cit> . the complementary effect of multiple individuals completed the transcriptome assembly in both transcript number and length  <cit> . second, although lncrnas often express in a low frequency, lncrnas that expressed in less than 25% of individuals were filtered out. this procedure could greatly reduce the assembly errors and improve the reliability of the remained lncrnas. moreover, the sequences were further validated by pcr sequencing and the expression level of lncrnas was proved by qpcr. the results suggested the sequence of lncrnas was high-quality assembled and the expression level was accurately evaluated. nevertheless, we would demonstrate that a small proportion of the identified lncrnas may be not real in our data, as non-coding transcripts derived from transposable elements were not filtered out due to the lack of a sequenced genome from m. lutarioriparius. in summary, the population-wide rna-seq assembly approach for identifying lncrnas was proven as an efficient method and could be applied for other species.

relaxed expression regulation of lncrnas and more sensitive to environment compared with protein coding mrnas
in our study, we found the expression diversity of lncrnas were significantly higher than that of protein coding rnas in both jh and qg, the two independent strictly controlled experiments . this result may be explained by that population of miscanthus harbored more substantial variation in noncoding regions of the genome, including extensive genetic variation within cis-regulatory elements and transcription factor binding sites. the results also implied that lncrnas may be loosely regulated compared with protein coding mrnas  <cit> . this may be due to that lncrnas do not directly function and a large number of lncrnas are nonfunctional, and thus changes in most lncrna expression exact little fitness cost  <cit> . higher-level expression diversity of lncrnas may provide the indirect evidence for that lncrnas experienced more relax evolution or divergent selection than protein coding mrnas.

previous results that lncrna expression is typically more variable between tissues  <cit> , which may be an indicator that the expression diversity of lncrnas in population could be larger than mrnas. based on this inference, lncrnas may be more variable among individuals, i.e. preferential expression in some individuals, but the majority of the mrnas were consistently expressed in all individual  <cit> . this hypothesis could be illustrated by the comparison of expression frequency between lncrnas and protein coding mrnas . expression diversity provides raw materials for adaptation, because it represents a source of variation may enrich phenotypic variation at the level influencing more closely than genetic diversity and consequent fitness under natural selection  <cit> . thus the lncrnas and protein coding mrnas with higher expression diversity had the higher potential as a variation factor in contribution to phenotypic variation  <cit> . moreover, the lncrnas had even more higher potential to be the variation factor than compared to protein coding mrnas due to their higher variation of expression frequency .

it intuitively seems that the range and average value of expression diversity ratio of lncrnas between jh and qg are wider and higher than that of mrnas, respectively . the widened ranges of expression levels and larger expression diversity suggest the lncrnas are more sensitive to environmental change than mrnas. as lncrnas can epigenetically regulate the protein coding mrnas by interacting with cis or trans elements  <cit> , the increased expression diversity of lncrnas might have triggered the mechanisms of enriching the expression diversity of genes in response to the environmental change  <cit> . moreover, studies on adaptation in wild populations had revealed that ecologically important phenotypes changed due to the transcriptional regulation . thus, the increased diversity of lncrnas may contribute to the change of ecologically important phenotypes such as wue in our study and play an important role in improving the adaptation to new environment  <cit> . thus, the lncrnas with increased expression diversity could be the potential target contributing to adaptation.

important roles of lncrnas in regulation of stress response and agricultural trait
previous studies have demonstrated that after stimulation with stress, expression level and expression diversity for some genes or transcription factors related to stress response were elevated  <cit> . however, the expression variation for lncrnas had been little reported after stress stimuli. here we found that the expression level of  <dig> lncrnas  and  <dig> mrnas  altered more than two-fold , which suggested the proportion of lncrnas with high expression fold change is comparable to mrnas. among the lncrnas that we identified, we found that  <dig> lncrnas  may be related with stress condition based on the e
d ratio, which reveal that extent of expression variation between two environments  <cit> . in particular,  <dig> lncrnas had e
d ratio of more than 5-fold changes, which exhibited strong stress-responsive expression pattern  <cit> . moreover,  <dig> lncrnas expressed at the level of nearly 100-fold increase from jh to qg. these lncrnas with extreme change of expression could have the potential roles in adaptation to stress  <cit> .

a large number of genes which were highly correlated with lncrnas were identified using mrna-lncrna co-expression network analysis and their go term enrichment analysis  <cit> . and  <dig> categories of genes were closely related to cellular stress response using go term enrichment analysis . protein kinase domain played a role in a multitude of cellular processes, and protein kinase pathway mediated drought and cold signaling  <cit> . ring finger domain mainly involved in ubiquitination pathway and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . cytochrome p <dig> mainly involved in biosynthetic reactions and biotic stress  <cit> . functions of wd domain, g-beta repeat ranged from signal transduction and transcription regulation to cell cycle control, autophagy and apoptosis, and they may response to salt stress and nutrient stress . these enrichment pathways could have been related with the cold and dry climates and poor soil conditions in the loess plateau. these results suggested that lncrnas could have played the roles in many biological processes responding to stress through regulating gene network.

the higher wue was likely to be one reason for the higher biomass production with much less precipitation in more stressful environment  <cit> . using co-expression network analysis, we identified  <dig> unique lncrnas involving in the regulation of these candidate genes, which revealed a regulation pattern of lncrnas in the manner of the accumulation of numerous minor lncrnas for complex traits. out of these lncrnas,  <dig> lncrnas regulated at least  <dig> candidate genes. this suggested that lncrna has the potential to be the regulation center in the wide-range participation. furthermore, the environmental change from jh to qg involves intricate natural condition, including soil water content, light condition, temperature etc.  <cit> . complex co-expression network regulation could be one of the most important molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation to these conditional changes  <cit> . the evidence presented in this study indicates that only a small proportion of lncrnas with large expression variation has an impact on phenotypic variation in wue. it is reasonable to infer that much more lncrnas may participate in the response to other conditional changes. here we revealed the regulation pattern of lncrnas for complex traits  <cit> , which provided a good starting point towards understanding the role of lncrnas in regulation of abiotic stress tolerance.

although we identified a large number of lncrnas related with many biological process, a limited number of lncrnas had been speculated their functions using lncrna-mrna co-expression analysis. further studies are necessary to understand the functional motifs of lncrnas, and how specific lncrnas seek out selective sites in the genome for lncrna-mrna and lncrnas-lncrnas interaction.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified population-wide lncrnas in m. lutarioriparius under two different field conditions. the expression level and the variation of expression of lncrnas in population were systematically characterized and were compared with protein coding mrnas. we proposed that lncrnas may experience more relaxed evolution or more divergent selection compared with protein coding rnas. in response to new environment, lncrnas may be more sensitive to environmental change than protein coding rnas. this study would provide insights into the roles of lncrnas in plant stress responses. such information can be useful in the process of adaptation of second generation of energy crop.
