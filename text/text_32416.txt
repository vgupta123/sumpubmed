BACKGROUND
glial cells have long been considered to have only a supporting role in the central nervous system. substantial advances in the past two decades, however, shed light on the various physiological functions they perform and led to the current view that they are active participants of the tripartite synapse  <cit> , consisting of the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons as well as the glial cells, in particular astrocytes. several studies demonstrated the ability of astrocytes to sense, respond to and regulate neuronal function. importantly, astrocytes possess the complete set of membrane proteins to detect γ-aminobutyric acid  and glutamate , the major inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters of the brain, respectively. they express gaba  <cit>  and glu  <cit>  transporters, as well as ionotropic and metabotropic gaba  <cit>  and glu receptors  <cit> . activation of these proteins initiates various pathways in the glial cells including ca2+signalling  <cit> , eventually leading to the release of gaba or glu in either vesicular  <cit>  or non-vesicular  <cit>  manner.

among the various mechanisms by which astrocytes control neuronal functions, regulation of tonic inhibition may play a major role. gabaergic inhibition of neurons can be divided into phasic and tonic components. the phasic component is composed of discrete, transient inhibitory postsynaptic currents  corresponding to vesicular release events from the presynaptic axon terminal. these currents are mediated by low-affinity gabaa receptors in the synapse. in contrast, the persistent tonic gabaergic inhibition is mediated by high-affinity, slowly desensitizing, extrasynaptic gabaa receptors experiencing low concentrations of ambient gaba  <cit> . tonic inhibition has recently been demonstrated to have paramount importance. by modulating the membrane conductance of the postsynaptic neurons, tonic inhibition greatly influences the excitability of single neurons as well as networks  <cit> . moreover, tonic inhibition gains increasing attention in the treatment of pathophysiological conditions, like epilepsy  <cit>  or stroke  <cit> . despite its significance, however, the source of gaba that generates tonic current is still a matter of debate. some groups claim that ambient gaba concentration is set almost exclusively by vesicular gaba escaping the synapse  <cit> , while others argue that release from astrocytes constitutes a significant source for extrasynaptic gaba  <cit> .

in addition to the well-known interplay between the gabaergic and glutamatergic systems at the cellular and sub-cellular levels  <cit> , we previously demonstrated the existence of a direct interaction between gabaergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions at the molecular level  <cit> . we showed that uptake of glu triggered an elevation in the extracellular level of gaba both in vitro and in vivo. the direct coupling between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter transporters was found to be independent of glu receptor-mediated depolarization, external presence of ca2+ and glutamate decarboxylase activity. it was abolished in the presence of non-transportable blockers of either glial glu or gaba transporters, suggesting that the concerted action of these transporters underlies the process  <cit> .

in the present study, we explore the potential physiological and pathophysiological role of the glu/gaba exchange process in freshly isolated hippocampal slices and in the hippocampus in vivo. we demonstrate that the gaba released from astrocytes in response to glu uptake significantly contributes to the tonic inhibition of neurons during intense excitation. moreover, the generated tonic inhibition emerges in line with the increasing network activity, providing a tuneable, in situ negative feedback. we also describe the molecular mechanism by which glutamatergic neurotransmission is transformed into gabaergic inhibition and identify the source of releasable astrocytic gaba. we show that the negative feedback control of astrocytes on neuronal excitability offers significant neuroprotection during seizure-like activity. the physiological importance of the glu/gaba exchange mechanism is further substantiated by in vivo results, which are in accordance with our in vitro observations.

RESULTS
glial glu and gaba transporters are colocalized
we previously demonstrated that glu uptake evokes gaba release by reversal of glial gaba transporter  subtypes gat- <dig> or gat- <dig> in brain homogenates  <cit> . in the same study we also showed by costainings with the neuronal and glial markers neun, synapthophysin and gfap that, in accordance with the literature  <cit> , gat- <dig> transporters are expressed mostly in astrocytes  <cit> . furthermore, ultrastructural  <cit>  and functional  <cit>  data from other groups showed that gat- <dig> is expressed on glial processes ensheathing excitatory synapses. since the major glutamate transporters eaat <dig> and eaat <dig> are also localized to astrocytic end feet  <cit> , it is a viable hypothesis that gat- <dig> and eaats are coexpressed on astrocytic end feet surrounding glutamatergic synapses.

to evaluate the possibility that gaba and glu transporters colocalize in hippocampal slices, we performed gat-3/eaat <dig> double immunostaining. both stainings showed punctate structures throughout the hippocampus. in accordance with data from other groups, eaat <dig> immunoreactivity was most prominent in the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal cell layer of the ca <dig>  <cit> , while gat- <dig> was mainly localized to the pyramidal layer of ca <dig> and ca <dig>  <cit> . most importantly, the eaat <dig> immunoreactivity was largely colocalized with gat- <dig> in the pyramidal cell layer and stratum radiatum of both the ca <dig> and ca <dig>  region of the hippocampus. the immunoreactive puncta surrounded the cell bodies  and dendrites  of the glutamatergic pyramidal neurons at presumed astrocytic end feet sites. to quantify the degree of colocalization, we determined the pearson's coefficient  and the mander's coefficient   <cit> . the quantification showed high correlation between eaat <dig> and gat- <dig> immunoreactivity . the immunohistochemical analysis of the localization of gaba and glu transporters, therefore, confirms the possibility of close, molecular-level interaction between eaat <dig> and gat-2/ <dig> glial cells. although a minor fraction of gat-2/ <dig> and eaat <dig> may be expressed on neurons as well  <cit> , their density in neurons is much lower than in astrocytes; therefore, they are unlikely to affect each other's activity even if they were colocalized.

glu uptake-induced gaba release through glial transporters contributes to tonic inhibition of neurons
since the glial gat-2/ <dig> transporters are facing the extrasynaptic space instead of the synapse  <cit> , the potential consequence of a transporter mediated glial gaba release is the activation of extrasynaptic gabaa receptors and the subsequent enhancement of tonic inhibition on neurons. to investigate the contribution of glial gats to neuronal gabaergic currents, we performed electrophysiological recordings from ca <dig> pyramidal cells of freshly isolated rat hippocampal slices under control conditions and during enhanced activity of the glutamatergic synapses.

the impact of transporter mediated glial gaba release on neuronal tonic inhibition was assessed by blocking the glial gaba transporters with the gat-2/3-specific, non-transportable inhibitor snap- <dig>  while measuring the gabaergic holding current in ca <dig> pyramidal neurons that are extensively covered by a glial sheat  <cit> . we used csmeso3-based pipette solution to isolate gabaergic  currents in voltage clamped configuration by applying  <dig> mv holding potential to eliminate glutamatergic currents. synaptic currents were identified as gabaergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents  and baseline currents were validated as a measure of tonic gabaergic currents by adding the gabaa antagonist picrotoxin  at the end of  <dig> of  <dig> experiments . the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic current component was calculated as the change in the holding current in response to snap- <dig> application.

under control condition we did not observe significant change in the tonic current following blockade of gat-2/ <dig> transporters by  <dig> μm snap- <dig> . local initiation of glu release in the ca <dig> region by applying stimuli to the schaffer collaterals by a bipolar tungsten electrode also did not reveal a gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic current component .

to investigate whether glu uptake induced glial gat reversal can occur under enhanced neuronal activity, we applied reduced- buffers to remove the mg2+ blockade from nmda receptors  <cit> . it is important to differentiate these reduced- buffers from the low- epilepsy model, used both in our lab  <cit>  and by other groups  <cit> . the conditions applied in these experiments differ from seizure-generating conditions in two essential terms:  extracellular  was not elevated in contrast to the slightly increased value  used in seizure generation  <cit>  and  we used  <dig> μm hippocampal slices in which the connectivity is less preserved than in the  <dig> μm slices usually utilized as an epilepsy model  <cit> . as a consequence, recurrent seizure-like events were observed in only 20% of the slices exposed to the  =  <dig> μm or  =  <dig> μm environment.

application of  =  <dig> μm buffer resulted in a significant increase in both frequency  and amplitude  of spontaneous ipscs . under these conditions, blockade of gat-2/ <dig> transporters significantly suppressed the tonic inhibition of ca <dig> pyramidal cells , demonstrating that, during enhanced excitation, gaba release by reversal of gat-2/ <dig> significantly contributes to the tonic inhibition of neurons. this behavior is in sharp contrast to the direction of tonic current change we would expect from a gaba transporter working in the typical, outside-in direction, where the transporter blockade would lead to increased gabaergic inhibition. snap- <dig> application during combination of reduced- condition with stimulation of schaffer collaterals resulted in similar reduction of the tonic current . it is worth noting that neither the frequency , nor the peak amplitude  of the sipscs changed significantly during snap- <dig> application compared to the preceding period, excluding the possibility that the decrease in the holding current is due to a change in ipsc kinetics.

to confirm that the gat-2/ <dig> mediated gaba release is directly evoked by glu uptake, we investigated whether the snap- <dig> sensitive tonic current component can be eliminated by blocking glu transporters. we specifically blocked the glial eaat <dig>  the dominant glu transporter subtype in the hippocampus  <cit> . if gat reversal was evoked by glial eaat activity, blockade of eaat <dig> should eliminate the snap-5114-sensitive tonic current. on the contrary, if gaba release was triggered by glu receptor activation, the higher extracellular glu level due to eaat blockade should result in enhanced snap- <dig> sensitive tonic current component. in reduced- buffer in the presence of the specific, non-transportable eaat <dig> inhibitor dhk , application of snap- <dig> had no effect on the holding current .

it is of note that the network activity in the presence of dhk was not significantly different from the reduced- condition without dhk , indicating that elimination of gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic current cannot be attributed to desensitization of glu receptors due to dhk blockade. we also excluded the possibility that the observed change in the holding current contributes to proteins other than the gabaa receptor. in the presence of the gabaa receptor antagonist picrotoxin , blockade of gat-2/ <dig> by snap- <dig> did not change the holding current , confirming that gaba released from glial cells by gat-2/ <dig> reversal activates gabaa receptors.

taken together these data demonstrate that during sustained excitation gaba released through gat-2/ <dig> in response to glu transporter activation significantly contributes to tonic inhibition of ca <dig> pyramidal cells.

gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic component emerges gradually with increasing network activity
to investigate whether the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic component turns on beyond a threshold level or emerges gradually in line with the increasing network activity, we explored the effect of gat-2/ <dig> blockade on tonic gabaergic currents in acsf buffers with different levels of extracellular . extracellular  was varied in a wide range from the full blockade to the total unblock of the nmda receptors  <cit>  . we showed that in the control buffer  there is no effect of gat-2/ <dig> blockade on the baseline current . applying  <dig> μm mg2+ that is still sufficient to block the nmda receptors  <cit>  also did not lead to gat-2/ <dig> reversal . partial unblock  <cit>  of the nmda receptors by  <dig> μm mg2+, however, revealed the snap-5114-sensitive component in the gabaergic tonic inhibition . further enhancement of the neuronal activity by applying  <dig> μm mg2+ or nominally mg2+-free buffer  led to a robust increase in the contribution of gat-2/ <dig> reversal to the tonic current .

to specifically measure the gabaergic tonic current, we used csmeso <dig> based pipette solution at  <dig> mv holding potential, the reversal potential of glu receptors. therefore, we could not simultaneously record excitatory postsynaptic potentials and use these values to correlate network activity with the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic current component. to circumvent this limitation, we utilized the sipsc frequency as readout of the network activity. although this rough estimation of the network activity may not be ideal, the frequency of sipscs, indeed, significantly increased in the reduced- acsf , suggesting the reliability of this assumption. the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic component as a function of the sipsc frequency  clearly shows that the tonic inhibition offered by astrocytes is proportional to the network activity.

tonic inhibition can be increased by exogenous glu
we also assessed the level of excitatory drive required to induce the astrocytic gaba release by stimulating eaat activity with different concentrations of exogenous glu. hippocampal slices were superfused with  =  <dig> μm buffer. fifteen minutes prior to glu application, the ampa and nmda receptors were blocked by antagonists cnqx  and dl-ap <dig> , respectively. under these conditions, application of  <dig> μm glu did not change the tonic gabaergic current . however,  <dig> μm glu significantly increased the tonic inhibitory current  without altering the synaptic sipsc parameters . further increase of the tonic inhibition was observed in the presence of  <dig> μm glu . the unaffected sipsc parameters indicate that most of the receptor-mediated actions of glu were indeed blocked by the applied antagonists. this was further confirmed by the addition of the broad spectrum metabotropic glu receptor antagonist -mcpg to the buffer.  <dig> μm glu was still able to significantly increase the holding current in the presence of  <dig> μm cnqx,  <dig> μm dl-ap <dig> and  <dig> μm -mcpg . although the increase in the holding current was slightly smaller in the presence of the metabotropic glu receptor antagonist -mcpg, suggesting the involvement of glutamatergic activation of gabaergic interneurons, the majority of the tonic inhibition increase is clearly attributed to glu transporter activation. additionally, blockade of the gaba release by the eaat2-specific inhibitor dhk  also supports the notion that glu receptors do not considerably contribute to the increase in tonic inhibition, since any glu receptor-mediated effect should have been intensified when glu uptake was blocked. altogether, these data demonstrate that gaba release from astrocytes can be directly evoked by physiologically relevant concentration of glu through the activation of glial glu transporters.

it is worth noting that under control conditions  we did not observe the enhancement of tonic inhibition following application of glu up to  <dig> μm either in the presence or in the absence of glu receptor antagonists cnqx  and dl-ap <dig>  with and without tetrodotoxin , suggesting that the preceding enhanced activity is a prerequisite for the emergence of the glu/gaba exchange process.

glu uptake and gaba release are coupled by changes in intracellular na+ level
next we addressed how the glu transporter activity can lead to gat reversal. both glu and gaba transport gain their driving forces from the concentration gradient of na+ between intracellular and extracellular compartments  <cit> . the co-expression of eaat <dig> and gat- <dig>  raised the possibility that they share a common na+ pool; therefore, the activity of eaat <dig> may directly affect the driving force of gat- <dig>  to investigate whether changes in intracellular na+ level is coupled to the glu-evoked gaba release, we monitored the intracellular  in astrocytes in the ca <dig> str. radiatum and str. pyramidale of rat hippocampal slices. the dye sulforhodamine  <dig>  was used to mark eaat expressing protoplasmic astrocytes  <cit>   that express glu transporters but not glu receptors  <cit> . the glial  was monitored using the na+ ion-sensitive dye sbfi.

under control conditions , application of snap- <dig>  decreased the glial , indicating that the glial gats are taking up gaba and na+ . contrary, activation of the glial eaats by the substrate t-pdc  produced a significant increase of intracellular  as the result of an inward eaat flux . subsequent blockade of the gat-2/ <dig> transporters by snap- <dig> in the presence of t-pdc further increased the intracellular   indicating that gaba transporters work in the reversed mode following eaat activation. comparing these results with the electrophysiological measurements in acsf on the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic current component in response to snap- <dig>  and exogenous glu suggest that although gaba can be released by the glu/gaba exchange mechanism under control conditions as well, its amount is most probably not sufficient to activate the extrasynaptic gabaa receptors.

when the network activity was intensified using the  =  <dig> μm buffer, snap- <dig> alone was able to increase the glial  , indicating that glial gats are reversed even without activating the eaats by exogenously applied substrate in accordance with the electrophysiological results . further triggering the glu/gaba exchange mechanism by  <dig> μm t-pdc resulted in a largely enhanced reverse uptake capacity for gat-2/ <dig> as indicated by the increased response to snap- <dig> .

it is worth emphasizing that the magnitude of the glial  changes in this experiment  underestimates the concentration changes in the vicinity of the transporters because the values were measured in the soma, far from the end feet where the most significant changes occur. as an example for  changes in a domain with the size comparable to the end feet of astrocytes, intracellular  may rise up to  <dig> mm in active dendritic spines of ca <dig> neurons  <cit> .

alternative metabolic pathway provides releasable gaba in astrocytes
electrophysiological studies outlined above clearly showed gat-2/ <dig> mediated gaba release from astrocytes. the source of glial gaba, however, remained undecided. gaba is synthesized mainly from glu by the enzyme glu decarboxylase. the majority of this pathway takes place in neuronal cells  <cit> ; therefore, it is widely believed that astrocytes do not contain significant amounts of gaba. there is, however, an alternative metabolic pathway to gaba. the polyamine putrescine can be converted to gaba by monoamine oxidase  <cit>  in neurons and glial cells as well  <cit> . several lines of evidence suggest that this alternative pathway might play a neuroprotective role in multiple models of epilepsy  <cit> . we previously demonstrated by nmr measurements that glu-induced gaba release is, indeed, independent of glu decarboxylase  <cit> . therefore, we sought to assess whether gaba synthesized from putrescine in glial cells may be the source of the release. unfortunately, 13c or 14c labelled putrescine is unavailable currently. consequently, we could not directly test whether the released gaba originates from putrescine.

instead, we first opted to evaluate the potential of the putrescine-gaba pathway to produce significant amount of gaba by estimating the changes in the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of gaba and putrescine in the reduced- environment. since the ornithine-putrescine conversion represents the rate-limiting step in the polyamine synthesis  <cit> , we also monitored the concentration of the putrescine precursor ornithine. hippocampal slices were incubated in normal acsf and in  =  <dig> μm acsf for one hour. following the incubation, the bathing solutions were removed and used to assess the extracellular concentrations. the slices were subject to a mild digestion procedure  that is expected to selectively extract gaba from the cytosolic compartment and leave the vesicular stores intact. the digestion products were used to estimate the cytosolic concentrations. the putrescine, ornithine and gaba concentrations in both the slice extracts and the bathing solutions were determined by mass spectrometry. under control conditions, cytosolic putrescine concentration was found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/mg wet tissue, while extracellular putrescine was measured as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/mg wet tissue, both in good agreement with data from other groups  <cit> . gaba concentration was calculated as approximately  <dig> mm in the cytosolic compartment and approximately  <dig>  μm in the extracellular space, both in good agreement with previous values  <cit> . although the absolute concentrations should be treated with considerable care due to the indirect sampling protocol, they suggest that we indeed sampled the appropriate pools.

we found that putrescine and ornithine concentrations were significantly decreased in the cytosolic pool  in the reduced- environment. ornithine concentration was also decreased in the extracellular space when exposed to the reduced- acsf . these data demonstrate the increased metabolic conversion of ornithine and putrescine. cytosolic gaba concentration was also significantly decreased compared to the control condition. however, a remarkable increase was observed in the bath concentration of gaba  in accordance with the tonic inhibition measurements . the increase in the bath concentration of gaba and the decrease in cytosolic  were both completely blocked by  <dig> μm snap- <dig> , demonstrating that gaba release was indeed mediated by gat-2/ <dig> transporters. when snap- <dig> was present in the reduced- buffer, both cytosolic and bath  were increased , suggesting that maintenance of the putrescine-gaba conversion requires the continual removal of the synthesized gaba. in the absence of gaba efflux the ornithine-derived putrescine is released to the extracellular space by the depolarization-induced polyamine secretory pathway  <cit> . the marked difference in the putrescine concentrations in the absence and presence of snap- <dig> also signifies the correlation between the putrescine-gaba pathway and gat-2/ <dig> activity.

to confirm the contribution of the putrescine-derived glial gaba to the tonic inhibition of neurons, we investigated the tonic gabaergic currents under blockade of the putrescine-gaba metabolic pathway using the monoamino oxidase inhibitor deprenyl in combination with the diamine oxidase inhibitor aminoguanidine  <cit> . in the  =  <dig> μm buffer that was used to investigate the glu-induced gabaergic currents, the presence of  <dig> μm deprenyl and  <dig> μm aminoguanidine eliminated the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic current component .

furthermore, the involvement of the putrescine-gaba pathway as the source of releasable glial gaba was also confirmed by measuring the glial  changes in response to the eaat substrate t-pdc  and the gat blocker snap- <dig>   in the presence of  <dig> μm deprenyl and  <dig> μm aminoguanidine. activation of the glu transporters by t-pdc resulted in increased glial , however, this value could not be further increased by snap- <dig> during either control conditions or enhanced network activity, suggesting that the releasable glial gaba is missing when the putrescine-gaba pathway is blocked . it is worth noting that the magnitude of the glial  increase in response to t-pdc in the presence of deprenyl and aminoguanidine  was comparable to that measured in the presence of snap- <dig> when the putrescine-gaba pathway was intact , indicating that this  increase can be achieved when the gat-2/ <dig> transporters are not releasing the na+ to the extracellular space.

these data suggest that the putrescine-gaba metabolic pathway emerges during enhanced network activity and provides the glial gaba that contributes to the tonic inhibition of neurons.

glu uptake-induced gaba release from astrocytes reduces the duration of seizure-like events
since the glu uptake-induced gaba release correlates with the network activity and the metabolic pathway yielding the glial gaba is also known to be induced during enhanced activity  <cit> , it is reasonable to expect that the tonic current provided by astrocytes combats overexcitation in pathophysiological states characterized by sustained, enhanced network activity, such as epilepsy. to evaluate this possibility, we exposed freshly isolated,  <dig> μm entorhinal-hippocampal slices from p11- <dig> rats to nominally mg2+-free acsf with slightly elevated  extracellular . in the low- model of epilepsy  <cit> , 73% of slices generated recurrent seizure-like events  within  <dig> minutes from the exposure to low-/elevated- acsf. following the appearance of at least two fully developed sles, we applied  <dig> μm snap- <dig> to block the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic current component . the effects of snap- <dig> on the sles were quantified by measuring the total duration of the sles, the duration of the tonic- and clonic-like periods, the interval between two consecutive sles and the intensity of the sles . total duration of sles significantly increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s when the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic current component was blocked by snap- <dig> . the increase in duration specifically affected the clonic-like period , leaving the duration of the tonic-like period intact . the interval between sles and the sle intensity were also unaffected by snap- <dig> application .

the glu/gaba exchange mechanism modulates electrophysiological properties under physiological conditions in vivo
by monitoring the glial  to determine whether glial gats work in the normal or the reversed mode, we demonstrated that gat-2/ <dig> can be reversed by activating the glial glu transporters under physiological conditions . however, the amount of the released gaba is most probably not sufficient to activate the extracellular gabaa receptors . in vitro, the gaba provided by astrocytes can contribute to the tonic inhibition only when network activity is considerably enhanced. the network activity in an in vitro brain slice preparation, however, is inherently reduced compared to the in vivo intact brain  <cit> . to explore whether the glu/gaba exchange mechanism can provide significant contribution to inhibitory actions in vivo under physiological conditions, we studied the effect of t-pdc and snap- <dig> on the gamma range oscillation in the ca <dig> region of rats under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia.

the ca <dig> and ca <dig> gamma range  oscillations are hypothesized to share similar neuronal mechanisms under in vivo and in vitro conditions  <cit> . it is also well known that the hippocampal inhibitory neural network plays an important role in the gamma range oscillation  <cit> . it was also shown that gamma oscillation is coordinated by the intricate interplay between pyramidal cells and interneurons mostly by a dominant gabaergic inhibitory input on pyramidal cells  <cit> . importantly, under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia the ca <dig> region exhibits gamma range burst activity comparable to that during memory task performance  <cit> , albeit in the low gamma range .

topical injection  of the eaat substrate t-pdc  to the str. radiatum of the ca <dig>  resulted in the power increase of the current source density  in this region in the frequency range peaking around 31- <dig> hz. this effect lasted for about four to eight minutes. representative fft power changes after t-pdc injection compared to the pre-injection period showed significant  increase in the power of the gamma oscillation . in contrast, t-pdc injected with  <dig> mm snap- <dig>  evoked a power suppression at gamma peak . this suppression was also statistically significant in all injections in the ca <dig> str. radiatum, measured by the csd fft power spectrum. injection of 1% dimethyl sulfoxide  in saline solution  that is used to dilute snap- <dig>  did not change the gamma power  in the ca <dig> str. radiatum .

discussion
the experiments in this paper establish, for the first time, a direct conversion of glutamatergic excitation to gabaergic inhibition by astrocytes. we showed that during enhanced network activity a previously unrecognized inhibitory mechanism emerges, by which the uptake of glu is coupled to the subsequent reversal of the glial gaba transporters bringing about an elevation in the level of extracellular gaba and increasing the tonic inhibition of neurons. the presence of this glu/gaba exchange mechanism was demonstrated by measuring the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic inhibitory current component of ca <dig> pyramidal cells and by monitoring the glial  under the blockade of glial glu and gaba transporters in reduced- conditions. we identified the polyamine putrescine as the source of the releasable glial gaba. additionally, we revealed that the level of tonic inhibition provided by astrocytes is directly proportional to the network activity resulting in a tuneable, in situ negative feedback, which in turn counterbalances the excitation during recurrent seizure-like events in an in vitro epilepsy model. furthermore, we provided evidence that the glu uptake-induced glial gaba release occurs under physiological conditions in vivo, showing that increasing the extrasynaptic gabaergic signalling by triggering the glu/gaba exchange mechanism results in the modulation of gamma oscillation power.

proposed model of glu induced gaba release
to explain the current findings, we propose a model for the mechanism underlying extracellular glu/gaba exchange by astrocytes . importantly, we showed that the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic current component can be diminished by blocking glial glu transporters , demonstrating that gat reversal is evoked directly by glu uptake. removal of glu from the extracellular space is coupled  <cit>  to co-transport of  <dig> na+/ <dig> h+ and counter-transport of  <dig> k+, resulting in subsequent disruption of the resting electrochemical potential. because gaba transport is also driven by the na+ gradient, the increased intracellular  may be capable of reversing gaba transporters. both theoretical and experimental studies suggest that gaba transporters operate close to their equilibrium potential  <cit> ; therefore, even small changes in the concentration of the underlying substrates  may initiate the reversed mode. indeed, we found that activation of glu transporters significantly increases the intracellular  even in the soma of astrocytes . following eaat activation, blockade of gat-2/ <dig> further elevates glial  demonstrating that glial gaba transporters are reversed. importantly, the  changes in the local environment of the transporters are expected to be more substantial. taking into account the presence of gat-2/ <dig> on astrocytic end feet ensheathing glutamatergic synapses  <cit>  and the colocalization of eaat <dig> and gat-2/ <dig> , the glial glu and gaba transporters may share a common domain in the astrocytic end feet. therefore, the na+ influx through eaats may robustly change the driving force of gats and can lead to transporter reversal.

according to our model, the released gaba activates the extrasynaptic gaba receptors and contributes to the tonic inhibition of neurons. this transporter-mediated molecular interplay represents a direct link between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission and functions as an adjustable negative feedback that may combat intense excitation in epilepsy. indeed, we found that in the low- model of epilepsy, blockade of the gaba release through gat-2/ <dig> transporters significantly increases the duration of seizure-like events , signifying the role of glu/gaba exchange process in neuroprotection. moreover, beyond the primary benefit of turning excitation into inhibition, the glu/gaba exchange also contributes to the recovery of the transmembrane na+ gradient without using atp thereby saving energy while protecting the neurons. our in vivo findings of increased power in the gamma range due to t-pdc application and its elimination by snap- <dig> also strengthen the hypothesis that glu induced gaba release can play an important role in the hippocampal excitability.

occurrence of the glu/gaba exchange mechanism under in vitro conditions
it is an important issue under what circumstances the glu/gaba exchange appears. under in vitro conditions we observed gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic current component only in low- environment. although glial  measurements suggest that the gat-2/ <dig> transporters can be reversed by activation of the glu transporters under normal, physiological activity , blockade of gat-2/ <dig> did not change the tonic inhibition of ca <dig> pyramidal neurons  under the same conditions. the apparent discrepancy between the measurements of glial  level and of tonic inhibition may denote that the gaba released through gat-2/ <dig> is either taken up before reaching the extracellular gabaa receptors or its concentration is not sufficient to activate them. since gat-2/ <dig> are localized on glial processes facing the extrasynaptic space  <cit>  where the gabaa receptors responsible for the tonic inhibition reside  <cit> , the synaptically localized gat- <dig> transporters cannot take up the released gaba. therefore, having no major route to remove gaba from the extrasynaptic space, it is more likely that under control conditions the released amount of gaba is not sufficient to activate extrasynaptic gabaa receptors.

enhancing the network activity by lowering the extracellular  turns on the glu/gaba exchange process as monitored by both glial  measurements  and gabaergic tonic inhibition . lowered  and increased network activity may lead to diverse physiological actions. as some examples, low mg2+ level can open up trpm <dig> channels resulting in na+ influx  <cit>  and subsequent depolarization of neurons. the increased network activity can also initiate overexpression of glial glu and gaba transporters  <cit>  that may enhance the magnitude of the glu/gaba exchange process. moreover, reversal of glial gaba transporters can also be facilitated by increased glial gaba production in response to the elevated extracellular   <cit> .

glial gaba production can also be enhanced by activation of the putrescine-gaba pathway. although the source of glial gaba is poorly understood, it has been demonstrated that gaba is indeed available in astrocytes  <cit> . apart from the major source of gaba , an alternative pathway does exist in the brain by which gaba is formed by monoacetylation of the polyamine putrescine in both neurons and glial cells  <cit> . although the capacity of this pathway is modest, it can produce detectable levels of gaba in astrocytes  <cit> . importantly, this pool of gaba is inducible. the formation of gaba from putrescine is markedly increased in the epileptic mouse strain dba/2j  <cit> . also, long-lasting increase in putrescine level was demonstrated following kainate-induced seizure activity in rat brain in vivo, particularly in the hippocampus  <cit> . moreover, putrescine production can also be induced by glutamine  <cit> ; therefore, it can be directly coupled to the uptake of glu that is converted to glutamine by astrocytes. the activity induced formation of gaba from putrescine, therefore, is a good candidate to explain the source of the released gaba and may also enlighten why putrescine overproduction offers neuroprotection by significantly increasing seizure threshold  <cit> .

in conclusion, among the various physiological changes in response to the low- environment, we consider the activity-induced enhancement of the putrescine-gaba synthetic pathway as the major determinant of the appearance of the glu/gaba exchange mechanism, because its blockade eliminated the gat-2/ <dig> mediated component of both the tonic inhibition  and the glial  increase .

occurrence of the glu/gaba exchange mechanism under in vivo conditions
either the activation of the putrescine-gaba pathway or some other mechanisms underlie the emergence of the glu/gaba exchange, the gat-2/ <dig> mediated tonic inhibitory component could only be detected during intensified network activity under low- conditions in vitro. the network activity in an in vitro brain slice preparation, however, is inherently reduced when compared to the in vivo intact brain  <cit> . it is, therefore, feasible that the intrinsically higher in vivo network activity may provide sufficient drive to trigger the glu/gaba exchange mechanism. indeed, the gamma range oscillation that is known to be coupled to the gabaergic inhibitory input on pyramidal cells  <cit>  has been modulated by the glu transporter substrate under in vivo physiological conditions. although the application of a glu transporter substrate/inhibitor may affect the network dynamics in several different ways, it is important that the modulatory effect of t-pdc could be fully reversed by snap- <dig>  if the gamma power increase was produced by a rise in the extracellular glu in response to t-pdc application, the resulting excitation cannot be eliminated by the blockade of the glial gaba transporters that are working in the standard, outside-in direction, due to the minor contribution of gat-2/ <dig> to the total gaba uptake capacity. the inversion of the t-pdc induced gamma power modulation by snap- <dig>  therefore, suggests that they are acting on different targets of the same mechanism.

potential therapeutic implications
the magnitude of tonic inhibition provided by glial glu/gaba exchange is proportional to the degree of network activity, thus it is more prominent in excited states. from the pharmacological point of view, treatments that target a mechanism up-regulated in situ in pathological conditions may represent an ideal strategy for drug development.

the coupling between substrate activation of eaats and subsequent gaba release can well explain some previous observations. the mechanism implies that transportable and non-transportable inhibitors of glu uptake should have differential effects on neuronal viability. indeed, this distinction was observed in several cases. in contrast to the non-transportable blocker dhk, the substrate t-pdc did not evoke neuronal damage in vivo even in very high concentrations , despite the fact that extracellular  elevation was similar  <cit>  or even higher  <cit>  after t-pdc application than following dhk treatment. also, in vivo administration of tboa in the hippocampus was demonstrated to induce neuronal damage in the ca <dig> and the dentate gyrus, while t-pdc application did not produce cell death  <cit> .

overexpression of glial glu and gaba transporters may significantly increase the magnitude of the glu-induced gaba release by increasing both the na+ influx through eaats and the amount of gaba released through gats. the antiepileptic drugs clobazam and levetiracetam have been shown to up-regulate gat- <dig> expression in the hippocampus  <cit> . the marked increase of gat- <dig> expression in astrocytes was also demonstrated in the hippocampi of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy  <cit> . the dysfunction of the mechanism may also lie behind the impairment of the cross-talk between excitatory and inhibitory transport processes in temporal lobe epilepsy  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study, together with our previous work, demonstrates the existence of a previously unrecognized adaptive neuroprotective mechanism, by which astrocytes offer an in situ, tuneable negative feedback on neurons. in acute hippocampal slices, the mechanism can be observed only during enhanced network activity evoked by low- condition. however, occurrence of the glu/gaba exchange mechanism in vivo suggests that the glu/gaba exchange can be operational under physiological conditions in the intact brain. we envision that the discovery of the conversion of glutamatergic excitation to tonic inhibition will deepen our understanding of how physiological network activity can be regulated in the brain and may open up new possibilities for the treatments of pathological conditions, such as epilepsy or ischemia.
