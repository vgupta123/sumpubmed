BACKGROUND
prevotella intermedia, a gram-negative, black-pigmented anaerobic rod, is frequently isolated from periodontal pockets of patients with chronic periodontitis  <cit> , acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis  <cit> , pregnancy gingivitis  <cit> , and endodontic lesions  <cit> . this organism possesses a number of virulent factors that underlie it's pathogenic potential for causing infections  <cit> .

p. intermedia strain  <dig> was initially isolated from a chronic periodontitis lesion in our laboratory  <cit>  and some of its phenotypic characteristics were determined. among these included the ability of the organism to:  produce viscous materials in vitro  <cit> ;  invade human oral epithelial cells  <cit> ; and  stimulate cd4+ t cells expressing vβ <dig>  vβ <dig> and vβ <dig>  <cit> . more recently, the whole genome sequence of strain  <dig> was determined by the institute for genomic research   <cit> .

in our earlier study, we demonstrated that a clinical isolate of prevotella nigrescens is able to produce extracellular viscous material that might contribute to its biofilm formation  <cit> . in this context, we hypothesized that the ability of p. intermedia strain  <dig> to produce viscous materials might be essential for its biofilm formation. in this study, we describe the chemical composition of the viscous materials as determined by means of high performance liquid chromatography  and colorimetry. to define the role of the extracellular viscous materials in biofilm formation, we identified and obtained a naturally-occurring variant strain that lacked the ability to produce viscous materials in vitro from our stock culture collections of strain  <dig>  designated as 17- <dig>  we compared the ability of these two strains  in their ability to form biofilms and to induce abscess formation in mice as an indication of their pathogenicity. further, we sought to determine the gene expression profiles associated with the biofilm formation by these two strains using microarray assays.

RESULTS
viscosity of spent culture medium
stock cultures of p. intermedia strain  <dig> were transferred to enriched-trypticase soy broth  and grown for  <dig> h. the viscosities of spent culture media were measured by a rotary viscometer. all tested p. intermedia strain  <dig> stocks, with the exception of one particular stock strain, designated as strain 17- <dig>  produced materials in vitro that were highly viscous as compared to the control tsb medium. in contrast, the viscosity of spent culture medium obtained from strain 17- <dig> was similar to that of the control tsb medium .

cell surface associated structures
sem observations on cells from colonies of these strains growing on blood agar plates revealed that strain  <dig> had dense meshwork-like structures around the cells , but strain 17- <dig> lacked this phenotype . the lack of abilities to produce viscous materials in culture medium and to form meshwork-like structures around cells on strain 17- <dig> were stably maintained despite repetitive passages in vitro or in animals .

biofilm formation assay
the ability to form biofilm was investigated for strains  <dig> and 17- <dig> using crystal violet microtiter plate assay. strain  <dig> was consistently able to form biofilm on flat-bottomed polystyrene microtiter plates, whereas strain 17- <dig> showed poorer biofilm formation . quantitative analysis as measuring the optical density of destained biofilms at  <dig> nm revealed that the ability of strain  <dig> to form biofilm was significantly greater than that of strain 17- <dig>  .

morphology and chemical composition of the viscous materials
negative staining of the viscous material isolated from strain  <dig> culture supernatants revealed that the viscous material was made up of fine fibrous structures formed in curly bundles . chemical analyses of this purified material showed that it primarily consisted of neutral sugars and small amounts of uronic acid and amino sugars , with mannose constituting 83% of the polysaccharide .

gene expression profiles of p. intermedia strains  <dig> and 17-2
to see what kind of gene expression events induce phenotypic differences on p. intermedia, we compared gene expression patterns between strains  <dig> and 17- <dig>  the respective viscous material producing and non-producing strains using microarray analysis. to determine the appropriate time point for isolating total rna, we first observed the morphological changes of cell surface structures in each strain along with the bacterial growth. in general, the growth of strain 17- <dig> was faster than that of strain  <dig>  entering into an exponential phase at around  <dig> h and reaching the plateau in  <dig> h . strain 17- <dig> did not show the presence of cell-associated fibrous materials at any stage of the growth cycle . by contrast, strain  <dig> showed a slower growth rate  with a longer exponential growth phase. morphological observation of cultures at different stages of growth revealed that strain  <dig> exhibited cell surface-associated meshwork-like structures at  <dig> h and the structures became denser with time . from these preliminary data,  <dig> h-old cultures of strains  <dig> and 17- <dig> were chosen for a comparison of gene expression patterns. when the microarray expression data for strains  <dig> and 17- <dig> were compared, a total of  <dig> genes were up-regulated by at least two-fold with statistic significance  in biofilm-forming p. intermedia strain  <dig> . the expression data demonstrated that several heat shock protein  genes, such as dnaj, dnak, groes, groel and clpb were up-regulated in strain  <dig> . we also identified two genes down-regulated at least two-fold in strain  <dig>  site  <dig> protease family). the original raw data files have been deposited in center for information biology gene expression database   <cit> .

mrna levels for hsps validated by real-time rt-pcr
in the microarray analysis, we identified that several of the heat shock protein genes were up-regulated in strain  <dig> as compared with those of strain 17- <dig>  the increased expression levels of these genes were validated in an independent experiment by real-time rt-pcr using the 16s rrna gene as the endogenous control. annotations of these genes  on tigr data base were described in table  <dig>  except pin <dig>  five out of six of tested genes showed an at least fivefold increased average expression levels in strain  <dig> as confirmed by the quantitative real-time rt-pcr. although pin <dig> showed about a three-fold up-regulation in strain  <dig> by the microarray analysis, the average of increased expression level of pin <dig> was less than two-fold in the real-time rt-pcr analyses .

the data obtained from the microarray analysis as well as the real time rt-pcr showed that several of hsp genes were up-regulated in strain  <dig> in  <dig> h-old cultures as compared with those of strain 17- <dig>  next, we addressed the question of whether the different expression levels of hsp genes between the two strains are due to a lag of growth because strain  <dig> showed a slower growth rate than that of strain 17- <dig> . the relative expression levels of hsp genes through the culture period were obtained using real time rt-pcr by the strain. in strain  <dig>  the expression levels of these genes were fluctuating; increased in early exponential phase , decreased once in the middle of exponential phase , and then slightly increased again in early stationary phase. by contrast, strain 17- <dig> did not show such fluctuated transcriptional levels in all hsp genes through the culture period . judging from the comparison between strains  <dig> and 17- <dig> at  <dig> h-old cultures , strain 17- <dig> seems to keep the expression levels of these hsp genes very low.

abscess induction in mice
to examine the influence of the biofilm phenotype on pathogenicity of p. intermedia, the abilities of strains  <dig> and 17- <dig> to induce abscesses in mice were compared. an injection of  <dig> μl of strain  <dig> at a concentration of  <dig> cfu/ml induced abscesses in mice . in contrast, injection of a similar amount of strain 17- <dig> at the same growth phase did not induce abscesses in mice. a much higher cell concentration  of strain 17- <dig> was required to induce abscesses in mice . however, an injection of a similar concentration of strain  <dig> was lethal for mice .

internalization of bacterial cells by human pmnls
in the phagocytosis experiments, strain  <dig> cells were rarely internalized, though many of these cells were bound to the cell surface of pmnls . in contrast, strain 17- <dig> cells were readily internalized by pmnls after  <dig> min incubation. many of these bacteria were found in cytoplasmic vacuoles .

gene expression profiles of strain  <dig> in biofilm in vitro
we next attempted to compare gene expression patterns of strain  <dig> between in biofilm and in planktonic conditions in vitro. total rna was isolated from  <dig> h cultures of strain  <dig> on solid culture media as its biofilm-forming cells and liquid cultures as planktonic cells, respectively. when the microarray expression data were compared, a total of  <dig> genes were up-regulated by at least four-fold with statistic significance  in solid culture condition . the expression of several genes which including those for a levanase , an extracytoplasmic function -subfamily sigma factor , a putative lipoprotein , and a putative polysialic acid transport protein  were protruded. among hypothetical proteins, pina <dig>  showed extremely high levels of transcription.

discussion
it is well known that bacteria assuming biofilm-forming capacity have enormous advantages in establishing persistent infections even though they appear to be innocuous in their planktonic state  <cit> . exopolysaccharide  is one of the main constituents of the biofilm extracellular matrix  <cit> , and recent investigations have revealed that each biofilm-forming bacterium produces distinctive eps components e.g. alginate and/or psl found in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , acidic polysaccharide of burkholderia cepacia  <cit> , collanic acid, poly-β- <dig> -glcnac  or cellulose found in escherichia coli  <cit> , cellulose of salmonella  <cit> , amorphous eps containing n-acetylglucosamine , d-mannose, 6-deoxy-d-galactose and d-galactose of vibrio cholerae  <cit> , polysaccharide intercellular adhesin  of staphylococcus  <cit> , and glucose and mannose rich components found in bacillus subtilis biofilm  <cit> . in this study we found that p. intermedia strain  <dig> produced a large amount of eps, with mannose constituting more than 80% of the polysaccharides. among oral bacteria, the production of mannose-rich polysaccharide by capnocytophaga ochracea has been reported  <cit> . this eps provides a protection from attack by the human innate immune system  <cit> . we have also reported that a clinical isolate of prevotella nigrescens can produce a copious amount of mannose-rich eps  <cit> .

in this study, biofilm-forming p. intermedia strain  <dig> showed stronger ability to induce abscesses in mice than that of strain 17- <dig>  which was a naturally occurring variant of strain  <dig> that did not produce surface-associated fibrous material and therefore not capable of forming a biofilm. it is evidently shown that the slime/eps production is critical for bacteria to exhibit the resistance to the neutrophil phagocytosis  <cit> , though some eps are not essential to bacterial adherence to host cells or for systemic virulence  <cit> . jesaitis et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that human neutrophils that settled on p. aeruginosa biofilms became phagocytically engorged, partially degranulated, and engulfed planktonic bacteria released from the biofilms. deighton et al.  <cit>  compared the virulence of slime-positive staphylococcus epidermidis with that of slime-negative strain in a mouse model of subcutaneous infection and showed that biofilm-positive strains produced significantly more abscesses that persisted longer than biofilm-negative strains. tem observation in our previous  <cit>  and this study showed that p. nigrescens as well as p. intermedia with mannose-rich eps appeared to be recognized by human leukocytes but not internalized. leid et al.  <cit>  have shown that human leukocytes can easily penetrate staphylococcus aureus biofilms but fail to phagocytose the bacteria. though we have to carefully investigate the possibility that multiple mutations exist in strain 17- <dig> and lead to the observed incapability to induce abscesses in mice, it is conceivable that biofilm bacteria being held together by eps as in this case with strain  <dig> might present a huge physical challenge for phagocytosing neutrophils. in our previous study  <cit> , we observed the restoration of the induction of abscess formation in mice when the purified eps from the biofilm-forming strain of p. nigrescens was added to the cultures of a biofilm-non-forming mutant and injected into mice. as a consequence of these neutrophils being frustrated by their inability to phagocytose this bacterial mass, this might trigger the unregulated release of bactericidal compounds that could cause tissue injury as shown in the inflammatory pathway associated with lung injury  <cit>  or chronic wounds  <cit> . the cellular components from neutrophils themselves are known to exert a stimulatory effect on the developing p. aeruginosa biofilm when the host fails to eradicate the infection  <cit> .

bacterial biofilm formation is likely to involve a cascade of gene expression events associating with a crossover of many sensing systems directed against environmental changes  <cit> . when we compare the microarray expression data obtained from strain  <dig> as bacterial cells were producing eps to those of strain 17- <dig> as eps non-producing variant, stress inducible heat shock proteins were up-regulated in strain  <dig> at a gene transcriptional level. we can not particularize functions of these genes in biofilm formation of p. intermedia since a genetic transfer system for having gene-targeted mutants of this organism yet remains to be developed  <cit> . however, recent studies evidently showed a tight relation between stress responses and biofilm formation  <cit> , though stress response genes are not prominently up-regulated in some experimental biofilm formation  <cit> . we found in our earlier study that exposing biofilm-positive p. intermedia to environmental stress such as animal passages of the organism resulted in the up-regulations of hsps at a protein level with increased production of cell surface-associated meshwork-like structures. by contrast, animal passages induced neither the production of viscous materials nor the up-regulation of hsps in strain 17- <dig> .

when we compared the gene expression profiles of strain  <dig> cells plated on baps to those of planktonic cells in enriched-tsb, transcriptional levels of several genes including those for a levanase , putative σe  and a polysialic acid transport protein  were dramatically up-regulated on cells from the solid culture media. the highest transcriptional level was observed on a hypothetical protein  with ltxxq motif which is found in a number of bacterial proteins bearing similarity to the protein cpxp  <cit> . pina <dig>  is homologous to the gene for algu which affects the conversion to mucoidy and alginate production in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . the algu -dependent promoter of rpoh, well known positive regulator of heat shock genes, is known to be activated in mucoid type p. aeruginosa  <cit> . although plating of planktonic cells at an exponential phase itself is known to immediately induce the expression of heat shock regulons in e. coli  <cit> , we now hypothesize that, like algu  in p. aeruginosa  <cit> , p. intermedia strain  <dig> cells keep their stress response via one of ecf sigma factors activated; thus rendering this organism to maintain eps production at high levels in different growth conditions. however, so far we studied, gene clusters responsible for mannose-rich eps still remain to be elucidated. to address the question of whether the gene expression phenomena observed in this study represent gene expression events behind the eps production in p. intermedia biofilm, operon/genes for eps synthesis regulated by stress-responsive systems of this organism must be explored in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the data obtained in this study suggest that the prevotella biofilms mainly composed of mannose-rich polysaccharides contribute to their resistance to host innate defence responses resulting in the development of chronic infections in vivo, and may also suggest that stress responsive systems of this organism might be behind its biofilm formation. to figure out a biofilm formation-gene expression relay system in p. intermedia requires the development of a suitable molecular tool that is capable of introducing specific targeted mutagenesis on genes highlighted in this study.
