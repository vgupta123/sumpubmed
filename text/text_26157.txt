BACKGROUND
escherichia coli  is a common, variable, aerobic bacterial species that inhabits the gut of vertebrates  <cit> . strains of e. coli differ in a number of important characteristics including genome size  <cit> , gene content and virulence  <cit> . e. coli strains are classified into four phylogroups; e. coli strains of phylogroups a and b <dig> contain smaller genomes and are frequently non-pathogenic, while strains of phylogroups b <dig> and d encode more genes and are more often pathogenic .fig.  <dig> flow chart of the e. coli isolates investigated in this study. *fecal e. coli strains used in this study  either tested negative for all  <dig> virulence determinants  and were, therefore, considered fima-negative, or the strains were fima-positive, while still testing negative for all other virulence determinants



approximately 80 % of all e. coli strains of fecal origin are able to produce type  <dig> fimbriae, which are encoded by the chromosomal fim operon  <cit> . this operon consists of fimaicdfgh genes  <cit> , where fima encodes the major fimbrial subunit . fima is arranged in a helical manner along with minor components, one of which includes fimh   <cit> . e. coli type  <dig> fimbriae have been shown to mediate adhesion to a number of host cell types , thus potentially increasing virulence of fima-positive e. coli strains  <cit> .

e. coli strains are able to synthesize two types of bacteriocins - colicins and microcins. while microcins are low molecular weight oligopeptides, colicins are proteins with molecular weights between 30–70 kda. colicins and microcins differ in a number of additional parameters including operon organization, regulation of gene expression, export from producer cells, presence of post-translational modifications, antimicrobial activity, etc. . however, this classification is not strict, since colicin js  <cit>  is known to share features of both bacteriocin types. several bacteriocins  have been found to be associated with virulence factors  in e. coli strains .

previous studies have found associations between several genes encoding bacteriocin types and several virulence determinants, however, no association between type  <dig> fimbriae and bacteriocin genes has been identified . the role of fimbriae type  <dig> in the e. coli virulence is not clear  <cit> . this situation is likely a result of very frequent presence of type  <dig> fimbriae among e. coli strains  and the fact that in most e. coli strains the type  <dig> fimbriae are combined with other virulence determinants. therefore we collected a set of fecal e. coli strains encoding type  <dig> fimbriae as the only detected virulence determinant  and a set of e. coli strains with no virulence determinants .

in this communication, we studied prevalence of bacteriocin production and prevalence of bacteriocin types in both sets of e. coli strains to assess association of fimbriae type i encoding genes and bacteriocin determinants in e. coli strains. in addition, we also tested association between type  <dig> fimbriae determinants and other factors including biochemical profiles and e. coli phylogroups.

RESULTS
characteristics of e. coli strains
fecal e. coli strains used in this study   either tested negative for all  <dig> virulence determinants  and were, therefore, considered fima-negative, or the strains were fima-positive, while still testing negative for all other virulence determinants. to assess presence of other genes of the fima cluster, a fimh determinant, encoding adhesin mediating attachment of type  <dig> fimbriae, was tested on all fima-positive strains. except of  <dig> isolates, fima-positive isolates were also positive for fimh determinants . within groups of strains with different origins , a relatively small proportion  of e. coli strains had no detected virulence determinants. therefore, all strains were analyzed without regard for their origin.table  <dig> origin of e. coli strains and proportion of fima-negative or fima-positive strains



biochemical analysis
e. coli isolates  were positive for the following biochemical reactions: tre , man , sor , onp  ind , lys , suc , orn , esl , ado , h2s , cel , sci , mal , ure , ino  and phe . the utilization of substrate showed variable results in orn and suc reactions between fima-positive and fima-negative e. coli strains. biochemical analysis showed that the production of ornithine decarboxylase was significantly higher among fima-positive e. coli strains  compared to fima-negative strains . in addition, production of succinate dehydrogenase was significantly higher among fima-positive e. coli strains  compared to fima-negative e. coli strains .

detection of phylogenetic groups in e. coli strains
phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> e. coli strains revealed that fima-negative e. coli strains contained a significantly higher prevalence of phylogenetic group a  compared to fima-positive e. coli strains . phylogroups b <dig> and b <dig> were found less frequently among fima-negative e. coli strains , while the prevalence of phylogroup d was similar in both groups of e. coli strains . frequency of bacteriocin production in e. coli strains belonging to phylogenetic groups a, b <dig>  b <dig> and d, respectively, was not significantly different between fima-positive and fima-negative e. coli strains .table  <dig> prevalence of phylogroups and bacteriocin determinants among fima-negative and fima-positive e. coli strains



detection of bacteriocin-encoding determinants
genetic determinants encoding  <dig> bacteriocin types including  <dig> colicins  and  <dig> microcins  were tested in all  <dig> e. coli strains used in this study. strains with identified bacteriocin genes were more frequently found among fima-positive e. coli strains  compared to fima-negative e. coli strains . altogether,  <dig> microcin types and  <dig> colicin types were identified among fima-negative e. coli strains while all  <dig> tested microcin types and  <dig> of the colicin types were found among fima-positive e. coli strains . all of the identified bacteriocin determinants found among fima-negative e. coli strains were also found among the fima-positive e. coli strains.table  <dig> distribution of bacteriocin encoding genes among fima-negative and fima-positive e. coli strains



a higher number of microcin determinants was found among fima-positive e. coli strains  compared to fima-negative e. coli strains . similarly, a higher number of detected colicin determinants was also found among fima-positive e. coli strains  compared to fima-negative e. coli strains . in addition, an increased number of strains encoding colicin e <dig> was found among fima-positive e. coli strains  compared to fima-negative e. coli strains .

in silico analysis of e. coli genomes
a set of  <dig> publicly available e. coli genomes including  <dig> completed genomes in the ncbi database was analyzed for the presence of virulence determinants tested in our study. out of  <dig> genomes,  <dig> genomes  met the criteria of our study . in this set,  <dig>  genomes contained type  <dig> fimbriae as the only detected virulence determinant  and  <dig>  genomes did not contain any of the  <dig> tested virulence factors . no significant difference was found in the prevalence of bacteriocin determinants in the group of fima-positive e. coli strains  compared to fima-negative e. coli strains .

in addition, the subset of  <dig> complete genomes was analyzed. out of them,  <dig> genomes were suitable for our study . while  <dig>  genomes belonged to fima-positive group,  <dig>  genomes were fima-negative. bacteriocin genes were detected in only three fima-positive genomes.

discussion
the fima-negative e. coli, as well as fimbriae type i-possessing e. coli strains, used in this study were found to have similar frequencies in both humans and animals. a relatively small proportion  of e. coli strains had no detected virulence factors. these results are in accordance with other published data where  <dig> – 100 % of fima-positive e. coli strains were found  <cit> . detection of both fima and fimh determinants in majority of strains suggests that the complete fima cluster is present in most of the tested strains.

in silico analysis of  <dig> complete genomes identified fima determinant in 78 % of e. coli complete genomes. this finding is in accordance to previous studies  <cit>  and also with the experimental results of this work, where fima virulence determinant was identified in more than 80 % of isolates. on the other hand, the fima determinant was identified only in 25 % of  <dig> draft genomes suggesting that the fima determinant likely remained unsequenced in a number of draft genomes. similar underrepresentation was found also for bacteriocin determinants . this is in contrast to experimentally determined prevalence of bacteriocinogeny among human e. coli isolates where over 50 % of e. coli strains produced bacteriocins  <cit> . these findings suggest that in silico analysis of draft genomes is of limited value in this and similar studies.

to assess clonal character of isolates, the obtained data from biochemical screening and analysis of phylogenetic groups and bacteriocin determinants were analyzed using paup*  <dig> . using this approach,  <dig> and  <dig> individual strain types  were identified in the groups of  <dig> and  <dig> fima-negative e. coli isolates and fimbriae type i-possessing e. coli isolates, respectively, indicating that e. coli isolates in this study were not predominantly of clonal character.

e. coli type  <dig> fimbriae mediate adhesion to a number of host cell types including epithelial, endothelial and lymphoid cells  <cit> , where they recognize mannose-containing glycoproteins and activate epithelial cells via toll-like receptor  <dig>  <cit> . type  <dig> fimbriae are expressed by both uropathogenic and fecal e. coli strains. in murine models, type  <dig> fimbriae have been shown to be important in the persistence of e. coli urine infections and deletion of the fim gene cluster from the virulent e. coli strain o1:k1:h <dig> has been shown to decrease the virulence of this strain in the urinary tract infection model  <cit> . however, several other studies have demonstrated that the presence of the fim gene cluster was not correlated with uropathogenicity in humans . additionally, e. coli strain a <dig> 34/ <dig> , which has been approved as live oral vaccine preparation for infants in the czech and slovak republic, was shown to possess type  <dig> fimbriae  <cit> . another widely used probiotic strain, e. coli nissle  <dig>  is known to possess type  <dig> fimbriae as well as other adhesins   <cit> . these examples demonstrate that type  <dig> fimbriae are primarily important for attachment to eukaryotic cells and could be, in certain strains, important also with regard to virulence.

while phylogroup a  consists mostly of commensal strains, phylogroup b <dig>  consists mainly of extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli strains . the majority of tested strains in this study  belonged to a and b <dig> phylogenetic groups, which was the direct result of sampling e. coli strains without a specific set of virulence factors or e. coli strains harboring fima determinant as the only detected virulence gene. these findings are in agreement with the observation that non-pathogenic e. coli strains are usually in phylogroup a and b <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, our set of strains also contained strains from group b <dig> . moreover, no virulence factors were detected in of the  <dig> strains from this phylogroup, which indicates that the relationship between e. coli phylogroup and the presence of virulence factors is not exclusive.

since prevalence of phylogroups among fima-negative strains differed from fima-positive e. coli strains, it is possible that the observed differences in the prevalence of bacteriocin determinants between both groups of e. coli strains were in fact due to differences in the e. coli phylogroups. however, there is no clear association between bacteriocinogeny and e. coli phylogroups. gordon and o'brien  detected  <dig> phylogenetic groups and  <dig> bacteriocin types in a set of  <dig> fecal e. coli strains and did not find significant differences in the frequency of bacteriocinogeny in different e. coli phylogroups  <cit> . in our previous study, we have found that prevalence of colicinogenic strains was higher in phylogroups a and d compared to phylogroups b <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the study of budič et al.  revealed increased bacteriocinogeny in the phylogroup b <dig> among  <dig> uropathogenic strains  <cit> . in this study, no differences in the prevalence of bacteriocinogeny were found among fima-negative e. coli, while an increased bacteriocinogeny was found in the phylogenetic group b <dig> compared to phylogenetic group a in the set of fima-positive e. coli strains. although more frequent phylogenetic group b <dig> could be the reason of increased prevalence of bacteriocinogeny among fima-positive e. coli strains, increased prevalence of bacteriocin genes were found in all tested e. coli phylogroups , suggesting the association between bacteriocinogeny and the fima gene cluster.

in humans, two types of commensal e. coli strains  are known to exist. they differ in their ability to persist in the human intestine. while resident strains are present in the intestines of an individual for months at a time, transient strains only persist for days to weeks . in addition, it has been shown that the ability of e. coli strains to persist in the human intestines is associated with several virulence factors, especially various fimbriae  <cit> . since the e. coli strains in phylogroup b <dig> are typical for resident flora  <cit>  and e. coli of phylogroup a is typical for transient strains  <cit>  the fima-negative e. coli isolates in this study appear to be more frequently transient strains.

the fima-positive e. coli strains were more often positive for activity of ornithine decarboxylase compared to fima-negative e. coli. activity of ornithine decarboxylase, which results in production of polyamines , helps to cope with stress conditions, such as oxidative radicals  <cit>  and low ph  <cit> . in addition, polyamines play an important role in biofilm formation  <cit> . there is a relationship between cellular adherence and biofilm formation in certain strains of e. coli  <cit> .

this study has shown that fecal fima-positive e. coli strains produced bacteriocins more often compared to similar, but fima-negative, strains. bacteriocin synthesis appears to be important in microbial communities because of its potential invasive and defensive roles  <cit> . moreover, antimicrobial effect of individual bacteriocin types showed differences with respect to their activity on e. coli strains  <cit> . in previous studies, the occurrence of several bacteriocin genes was found to be associated with several genes encoding virulence factors  and the results of this study extends the original findings. bacteriocin types and their sequences have been shown to be host population-specific  <cit> , indicating that bacteriocin-encoding determinants mainly spread among and within hosts. since virulence genes likely evolved and are being maintained to improve inter-host persistence of commensal bacteria  <cit> , bacteriocin synthesis may further promote stable colonization of the gut. similar findings were published by gillor et al.  <dig>  <cit> , in which they reported that bacteriocinogeny plays a significant role in the colonization of e. coli in the intestinal tract. as with type  <dig> fimbriae, which were shown to increase virulence in the urinary tract infection model  <cit> , synthesis of colicin e <dig> was found to be associated with uropathogenic strains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, fima-positive e. coli strains of human and animal origin were found most often to be in phylogroup b2; additionally, fima-positive e. coli strains tested positive for ornithine decarboxylase, succinate dehydrogenase and bacteriocin synthesis more frequently than fima-negative e. coli strains. all these findings are consistent with increased adherence to intestinal epithelium, increased bacterial virulence, and increased ability to survive in the intestine.
