BACKGROUND
the gram-positive, coryneform, fastidious, xylem-inhabiting bacteria leifsonia xyli comprises two subspecies: l. xyli subsp. xyli  and l. xyli subsp. cynodontis . in its unique natural host, lxx causes ratoon-stunting disease, a malady that affects sugarcane commercial fields worldwide, promoting losses of up to 30% in susceptible varieties  <cit> . sequencing of the lxx genome has provided important insights into the biology and pathogenicity of this bacterium  <cit> . lxc is an endophyte of bermuda grass  and, when artificially inoculated, can grow in and colonize the xylem of agriculturally important grasses , causing no  symptoms of disease  <cit> . some studies suggested that lxc may be a potential vector for expressing heterologous proteins in plants  <cit> . we have initiated a genome-based approach to compare lxc and lxx by sample sequencing the lxc genome. our goal is to comprehensively assess gene content and genomic organization of these two closely related bacteria to enhance understanding of the differences in their pathogenicity and host range. here, we present the in silico characterization of insertion sequence  elements, the most abundant type of mobile genetic element found in l. xyli  <cit>  and their involvement in lxc and lxx genome diversification.

is elements are small transposable dna fragments ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kbp, comprising a transposase-encoding gene and terminal inverted repeats   <cit> . close to  <dig>  different is elements have been reported in the chromosomes and plasmids of nearly all bacteria studied  <cit> . is elements may inactivate genes upon insertion or activate and/or enhance the expression of nearby genes. some are known to recognize specific sites of the genome that are duplicated after is insertion, resulting in direct repeats . is elements may provide the structural basis necessary to enable the rearrangement of genomic fragments and the incorporation of foreign dna either by active transposition process or indirectly, mediating homologous recombination between multiple copies present in a given genome  <cit> . they are believed to undergo frequent horizontal transfer and cycles of expansion and extinction within a given species, most likely as a consequence of transfer between genomes and plasmids  <cit> . their expansion, genome location and composition may differ among related bacteria, representing an important source of genomic diversity  <cit> . because its effects have a direct impact on cell survival, control of transposition is tightly regulated. intrinsic regulation is basically at the transcriptional and translational level  <cit> . in addition, several host proteins have been identified as part of the transpososome, the assembly of which may be controlled by host factors, thus integrating transposition activity and host physiology  <cit> .

previously,  <dig> copies of five distinct is elements  in the lxx genome were reported, along with  <dig> other transposase-related genes from uncharacterized elements  <cit> . in lxc, three is elements have previously been identified: is <dig>  <cit> , islxc <dig> and islxc <dig>  <cit> , located both on the chromosome and on the cryptic plasmid pcxc <dig> that is present in some isolates. a detailed characterization of two new lxc is elements  and one new lxx element  is presented, as well as a comparative review of all elements found in both genomes, their distribution among families  <cit> , and their comparative localization. the results support the hypothesis that is elements are components involved in the diversification of lxx and lxc, with their influence most likely occurring after the divergence of the two subspecies from their common ancestor.

RESULTS
the dataset of lxc genomic dna
the characterization of the is elements were realized within the dataset of lxc dsmz <dig> genomic dna. the dataset is comprised of  <dig>  reads, of which  <dig>  were derived from the shotgun library and  <dig>  from sequencing bac ends, sub-cloning of inserts and primer-walking. all sequences were assembled into  <dig>  contigs accounting for  <dig> , <dig> non-redundant bases, representing approximately 50% of the lxc chromosome. comparing all the sequences of lxc with the complete genome of lxx, we found that nearly 70% share more than 80% nucleotide sequence identity considering a continuous segment of at least  <dig> bases. two other genomes of related subspecies clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis and c. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus that were recently sequenced  <cit>  have nearly 80% of nucleotide identity using the same criteria. these figures were derived from the artemis comparative tool  <cit> .

lxc and lxx each have their own set of is elements
among all the contigs,  <dig> shared sequence similarity to transposase-encoding genes. fifty-six of these represented copies of five distinct is elements that were characterized based on the criteria proposed . the remaining  <dig> contigs correspond to uncharacterized is elements, since no ir, site of insertion and structural limits were identified within the available sequences. they were classified only tentatively based on homology searches with lxx genome, and were placed within is families : is <dig> family ; is <dig> family ; and is <dig> family . elements of the same families were not characterized in lxx as well  <cit> . these uncharacterized transposases may represent degenerated forms of old insertions, however they may also be used as site for rearrangements within lxc genome.

the transposases of characterized is elements shared less than 78% amino acid sequence identity with transposases of lxx elements . to be considered as iso-forms, transposases of a given element must share more than 95% identical amino acids  <cit> ; therefore, lxc and lxx have different sets of is elements. despite of that, most of the elements found belong to the same families , with the exception of is <dig> , which was not identified in our lxc dataset.

n – not complementary nucleotides

a – assuming predicted features for regulation of transposition at translational level are overcome.

b – according to chandler & mahillon family classification  <cit> .

c – three is <dig> copies have a g instead of a in the 3' ir, making perfectly complementary irs.

columns in bold represent the percentage from the total number of predicted transposases in the lxx genome and lxc datasets. the other values are the numbers found within each genome.

description of lxc is elements and comparison with related elements in lxx
in addition to the three is elements previously sequenced for lxc: is <dig> ; islxc <dig> ; and islxc <dig> , we identified two new elements, named islxc <dig>  and islxc <dig>  . a detailed characterization of all these lxc-is elements, and a comparison with related elements in lxx, is presented below.

is <dig> and islxx <dig>  is <dig> family members
is <dig> was first identified in the plasmid pcxc <dig> detected in some lxc isolates  <cit> . recently,  <dig> upstream and  <dig> downstream flanking sequences of is <dig> were described  <cit> . we identified  <dig> copies of is <dig>  represented by two variant forms:  <dig> copies were 899-bp long and almost identical, with a single polymorphism in the 3'-ir; two copies were  <dig> bp long . four copies were inserted within other is elements: one inserted within islxc <dig> and three inserted within copies of islxc <dig>  there was no read-through orf encoding an entire transposase within is <dig>  <cit> . if functional, the coding sequence, starting and ending at nucleotide positions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, would have to change frame  and overcome a premature stop codon . since the coding sequence of all 899-bp long copies sequenced so far were identical, it is reasonable to assume that such translational features could be involved in the negative control of transposition  <cit> . the putative transposase has the expected catalytic domain containing a dde motif  <cit> , but the number of amino acids separating these residues does not follow the pattern of the is <dig> family, and the glutamic acid is located downstream of the premature stop codon. analyzing lxx genome sequence, we identified islxx <dig>  a single copy of which is represented within the genomic island lxxgi <dig>  <cit> . in lxx, lxxgi <dig>  is a depository of is elements encompassing seventeen putative transposase genes  <cit> . islxx <dig> shows the highest nucleotide sequence similarity with an lxc-is element, the  <dig> bp-long is <dig> . interestingly, however, contrary to is <dig>  the islxx <dig> putative transposase gene  is read-through . both elements were classified as belonging to group is <dig> within is <dig> family based on multiple alignment using tribe-mcl . however, they share conserved amino acids with elements of group is <dig> . in addition, islxx <dig> presents a single orf and recognize three nucleotides as site of insertion, also common features of elements of is <dig> group. this may indicate the existence of another group within is <dig> family.

islxc <dig>  an is <dig> family member
islxc <dig>  <cit>  encompasses two orfs similar to the ista and istb transposases found in elements of the is <dig> family  <cit> . in our lxc dataset, we identified one copy of islxc <dig>  which was invaded by an is <dig> element. the is <dig> insertion is located  <dig> bp upstream of the first orf   and has duplicated the "taa" site of insertion within islxc <dig> . a second version of islxc <dig> not carrying a copy of is <dig> was amplified in dsmz <dig> with inwardly oriented primers complementary to the 5' and 3' irs. however this element was not mapped on lxx genome because we did not have the flanking sequences. islxc <dig> is  <dig>  bp long and 99% identical to that previously sequenced  <cit> . within both versions ista is truncated and the dde motif was not identified, therefore ista disruption was prior to the is <dig> insertion. istb may encode a 262-amino-acid protein containing the predicted nucleoside triphosphate-binding domain. it is preceded by a purine reach site, which in other elements is an indicative of ribosome frameshifting and coupled translation of ista and istb  <cit>  .

islxc <dig>  an is <dig> family member
islxc <dig> is a  <dig> -bp-long element   <cit> . the  <dig> copies identified here all contain at least one nucleotide polymorphism in different positions, none of which located in crucial sites such as start and stop codons or the dde motif. the putative transposase contains  <dig> amino acids and is interrupted by an in-frame stop-codon located  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the initiation codon . interestingly, the transposases of islxc <dig> and also islxx <dig> of lxx genome  <cit>  have stop codons within the host insertion site. the nctagn sequence is duplicated after element insertion and flanks both ends indicating that the translational end of the transposase may impose the structural limits on these elements, as described for other elements of the same family  <cit> .

three copies of islxc <dig> were invaded by is <dig>  in all the cases the insertion was located  <dig> bp upstream of the putative transposase gene, duplicating the tta site of recognition. generally, genes invaded by is elements become non-functional, but the is <dig> insertions were all at the same position within islxc <dig>  located upstream of the transposase gene . is elements located upstream of the coding region may create a hybrid promoter between the is element sequence and the gene and favor transcription of the later, which in this case is islxc <dig>  <cit> . however, this should be addressed experimentally.

islxc <dig> and islxc <dig>  is <dig> family members
two novel elements were identified: islxc <dig> and islxc <dig> . eight copies of islxc <dig> were found, six of which being  <dig>  bp long, and two copies with 3' end deletions at different positions. one of these defective variants  is associated with a reorganization event in lxc compared to lxx because one of the flanking regions is common to lxx and the other one is specific to lxc. this is an example showing that an is element may serve as a subject for homologous recombination, independent of its integrity. an imperfect ir of islxc <dig> was defined as a twenty-six bp long sequence starting with three non-complemented nucleotides, "ctt", at the 5'-end and "gcc" at the 3'-end, which were also detected for islxx <dig>  <cit> . the proposed irs were based on the experimentally proved structural limits of is <dig>  an is <dig> family element of neisseria meningitides  <cit> . in fact, the first nine nucleotides of 3'-ir are conserved among is <dig>  islxc <dig> and islxx <dig>  we failed in detect a conserved target site for insertion in multiple alignment considering  <dig> bases upstream and downstream of the element limits, but the duplication of ntg sequence was detected flanking two copies of islxc <dig>  the putative transposase was the only one described in lxc that was not interrupted by a premature stop codon or by a purine repeat associated with a frameshift.

islxc <dig> was found in five copies represented by two variant forms. two copies represented longer versions  and the other three copies  showed the same deletion within the core region, which were considered shorter versions of the islxc <dig> . the irs are twenty-eight bp long, and no dr was identified flanking the occurrences. regardless of been unusual for is <dig> family elements, the long version contain a cluster of purines , resembling a slippery codon for the frameshift . transposases of the is <dig> family encompass the helix-turn-helix  dna-binding domain at the n-terminal part and the well-conserved d--d--e motif at the c-terminal part  <cit> . in islxc <dig>  if the + <dig> frameshift does occur, the transposase  is  <dig> amino acids long and contains two domains. if the frameshift does not occur, the transposase  is  <dig> amino acids long, carrying only the dna-binding domain. truncated transposases with only the dna-binding domain may function as negative regulators of transposition when interacting with irs, resulting in either repression of the transposase gene promoter or competition with full-length transposases  <cit> . neither the dna-binding domain nor dde motif following the rule above were detected within the orf of the shorter variant.

analysis of is element loci in the lxc and lxx genomes
the average nucleotide sequence identity between homologous fragments of lxc and lxx is 93%, as calculated on  <dig> kbp of  <dig> continuous lxc-contigs, which were physically linked based on scaffold orientation. comparing the adjacent regions of all  <dig> lxc-is element with the lxx sequence,  <dig> elements could be mapped onto the lxx genome . all the flanking sequences of is elements were submitted to genbank and the accession number is available in the additional file  <dig>  four of these , which are three copies of islxc <dig> and one copy of islxc <dig>  have only one of the adjacent sequences homologous to the lxx genome. the other end is specific to lxc genome, indicating an association with genomic rearrangements. although some is elements of both genomes belong to the same families and may recognize the same target site for insertion, none of the lxc-is insertion loci were the same as for elements found in the lxx genome . the  <dig> remaining lxc-elements were inserted in specific regions of its chromosome .

is elements were randomly distributed throughout lxx genome , 25% of all insertions were located in what has been described as genomic islands  <cit> , in particular within genomic island lxxgi <dig>  comparatively the distribution of the elements in lxc also seems to be random; however our approach so far does not allow us to make the same inferences about islands in lxc genome.

to assess the impact of is elements in gene disruption, they were classified into three categories: is insertions within predicted genes; insertions in non-coding sequences; and insertions in non-coding sequences, but with one or two truncated genes nearby  . truncated genes were defined as those orfs that have a disrupted coding sequence based on blastx results. most of the elements were found inserted within intergenic regions for both genomes. in the lxx genome, disrupted genes were associated mainly with degradation of polysaccharides, transport and regulatory functions, while in the lxc genome they were linked to cell structure, regulatory functions and hypothetical genes . five of the putative genes truncated in lxc have truncated orthologs in the lxx genome however, in lxx no is insertions were detected: three of them probably encoded hypothetical proteins, lxx <dig> , lxx <dig>  and lxx <dig> ; another one, lxx <dig> , presented a conserved acyltransferase domain, associated with lipopolysaccharide modification; and the last one, lxx <dig> , presented a dna-binding domain. within lxc, those genes were invaded by is <dig>  islxc <dig>  islxc <dig>  is <dig> and islxc <dig>  respectively. no drs were detected within lxx orthologous that could be an indicative of a prior invasion and excision event. therefore is more likely that these genes were truncated prior to the is elements insertion in lxc.

distribution of l. xyli-is-related elements throughout actinobacteria
according to the isfinder database, elements of the is <dig> family are common in both archaea and eubacteria  <cit> . considering all is families found in leifsonia xyli, examining isfinder submission reports and using sequence similarity searches, we found that is <dig> elements were the least represented in the sequenced genomes of actinobacteria, despite being the most highly represented is element in the lxc genome. as observed in l. xyli genomes, transposases from the is <dig> and is <dig> families are abundant in most actinobacteria . each putative transposase of characterized is elements of leifsonia xyli genomes was used as query and compared to transposases of actinobacteria genomes, and the best blastx hit result was considered. most of the transposases shared around 70% of amino acid identity. the exception was is <dig>  which related elements of actinobacteria genomes did not share more than 50% identical amino acids. actinobacteria is one of the largest taxonomic units in terms of number and variety of species  <cit>  and members of is elements of most characterized families are represented within this group  <cit> . as probably expected no correlation was found between phylogenetic relatedness and is family distribution in actinobacteria genomes . not even among subspecies of leifsonia xyli and clavibacter michiganensis, which are much related to each other. this observation is in concert with the cycles of expansion and extinction of is elements proposed before  <cit> .

distribution of is elements in lxc isolates
to further examine the distribution of is elements between genomic dna of two isolates of lxc to check the involvement of these elements in diversification of strains, hybridization experiments were performed using fragments of three is elements of different families as probes. there are two bamhi sites within is <dig>  one within islxc <dig>  and none within islxc <dig>  there are no sites for psti, ecorv or ecori within these elements. is <dig> is the only element showing the same hybridization pattern between the two isolates for all tested enzymes . however, variable dna band patterns were detected for islxc <dig> and islxc <dig> . we believe that partial digestions can not justify such differences because the same stripped membrane was used in each experiment, and we do not see partials in the assay with is <dig>  also, polymorphism at the enzymes restriction site could not explain the differences since they were found for all enzymes used when probed with islxc <dig> and islxc <dig>  and they were not detected for is <dig>  mainly considering the abundance of the later in lxc genome. finally, we assume that these differences were probably not the result of large-scale rearrangements; otherwise they would also have been detected in the distribution of is <dig>  it is plausible to assume that the observed variation may result from homologous recombination between copies of these elements not interspersed by is <dig> copies, or that it may be associated with the presence of a variable number of elements, as a result of transposition of islxc <dig> and islxc <dig> to new locations. to assure any of these two hypotheses the bands should be isolated and the dna sequenced. in any case, the difference exists and is probably originating diversification in the isolates of lxc genomes. consistent with this are the data generated by young and collaborators where isolates of lxc showed different band pattern in dna fingerprinting  <cit> .

discussion
sequencing of approximately 50% of the lxc genome identified  <dig> copies of five distinct is elements, establishing that the lxc chromosome contains a larger number of is copies than the lxx genome  <cit> . the is elements of lxc were subjected to a careful analysis and compared to the elements of lxx and other actinobacterial genomes, in an attempt to understand their contribution to the genome diversification of the two l. xyli subspecies. also, taking into account that genome projects usually fail in a detailed characterization of these elements, we reviewed all the elements in both lxc and lxx genomes.

apart from sharing the same is families, there were no iso-forms in common between the lxc and lxx and the locations of insertions were distinct to each genome. analysis of the impact of is insertions revealed that, in both subspecies, most elements were inserted within intergenic regions. the higher percentage of this kind of insertion in lxx  as compared to the lxc genome  is probably due to the lxx-genome decay process, since a higher percentage of genes were already non-functional, as previously proposed  <cit> . insertions within genes or intergenic regions were independent of is family assignment for both subspecies. the lxc and lxx genome comparative arrangement was assessed by mapping the flanking sequences of each lxc-is element in the complete lxx sequence; some elements were associated with dna rearrangements and others were inserted into specific fragments of the lxc genome.

is <dig> is an unique element, with some similarity to elements of streptomyces coelicolor a <dig> , s. avermitilis ma- <dig>  and frankia sp. cci <dig> . an expansion of it was detected in the lxc chromosome, whereas elements of the is <dig> family were the least represented in actinobacteria. particularly intriguing is the presence of a single copy of an is1237-related element within lxx genome, the islxx <dig>  despite sharing 85% of nucleotide identity with is <dig>  the transposase of islxx <dig> appears to be intact. one would probably expect a larger expansion of it within lxx genome, but somehow its transposition may be controlled by mechanisms other than that regulated at translational level. this is probably an interesting model to be further analyzed. is elements are very often plasmid-borne, and transfer events between genomes and plasmids are common  <cit> , which may be the case of is <dig>  first described in the cryptic plasmid pcxc <dig> present in some of the lxc isolates  <cit> . the extended survey of all lxc and lxx-is elements among actinobacteria genomes showed no correlation between phylogenetic relatedness and distribution of is families, which is probably in agreement with the hypothesis that genomes undergo repetitive extinction-reinfection cycles of different is elements throughout bacterial evolution  <cit> .

most of the is families assigned in l. xyli were characterized by maintaining transposition at low levels using mechanisms, such as regulation at the translational level  <cit> , i.e., transposition occurs only when translation overcomes features of the sequences such as sites for ribosomal slippage and premature termination codons. so far, copies of lxc and lxx elements sequenced within each genome have proved almost identical, therefore, we have assumed that these features are part of the mechanism to regulate transposition, rather than being indicative of defective is elements  <cit> .

to assess the involvement of l. xyli is elements carrying these types of transposases in promoting genome reorganization, the distribution of three is elements of different families was analyzed in two strains of lxc. the observed band polymorphism raised the hypothesis that islxc <dig> and islxc <dig> are involved in diversification, either by being active in transposition or by promoting homologous recombination. variation was not observed for is <dig> hybridization, supporting previous experimental data where mobilization in vitro was not achieved  <cit> . conversely, the elevated number of identical copies within the lxc chromosome, the identical positioning in different isolates, and insertions within other elements suggest recent expansion of is <dig> 

transposon activity is regarded as an important source of bacterial diversity not only in promoting gene inactivation and genome reorganization but also in acquisition of new sequences  <cit> . consequently, there must be some equilibrium between the impact of those events in successful maintenance of the element and host viability. how the differential expansion happens even among close related species and strains remains to be fully understood.

CONCLUSIONS
the impact of is elements on genomic organization and gene content among closely related species has previously been described  <cit> , and our data further support such analyses. although the approach used to sequence the genome of lxc was limited, an extensive study using the data gathered was sufficient to show that the genomic diversification of lxc and lxx is also and perhaps primarily associated with the presence of distinct types of is elements. in addition to that, we have made a detailed characterization of is elements present in each genome, which is often missing in analysis of fully sequenced genomes. the set of is elements being unique to each genome, their specific location in combination with rearrangements and horizontal gene transfer are probably the major forces of genome evolution in leifsonia xyli and consequently should have an impact on its biology. the same is probably true for isolates of lxc as determined by our hybridization experiments. our study also provided information in concert with the concept that distribution of is elements in a given genome happens in evolutionary recent events due to cycles of expansion and extinction.

these data will probably contribute to our ongoing comparative analyses aimed at understanding the biological differences of the lxc and lxx genomes.
