BACKGROUND
th1-dependent immune responses have been shown to protect mammals against many clinically relevant intracellular pathogens, such as mycobaterium tuberculosis, leishmania sp., and human herpes virus, and even against some extracellular pathogens, such as candida albicans  <cit> . adjuvants for th <dig> immune responses could be, therefore, crucial components of a vaccine against this type of pathogens  <cit> .

different compounds have been tested for safety and adjuvant activity in human beings. aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate and montanide®, a new generation of water in oil emulsions, are still the only adjuvants licensed for use in humans  <cit> . lack of detailed data on safety, dose and routes of immunization has restricted to experimental animals the use of adjuvants that have been shown to be more potent or more directed to th <dig> immune responses than the aluminum compounds  <cit> .

the babassu  is a palm tree commonly found in the northeast of brazil. babassu fruit flower is frequently used as food or folk medicine. several important biological properties have been assigned to the babassu mesocarp flour, including an immunomodulatory activity  <cit> . it can increase the production of anti-insulin igm antibodies in mice  <cit>  and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies in rats  <cit> . in addition, the oral administration of an aqueous extract of babassu mesocarp to mice increased the production of inflammatory mediators  by peritoneal macrophages ex vivo and the influx of leukocytes to the peritoneal cavity  <cit> . these known immunostimulative effects of the babassu aqueous extract  have motivated the present investigation on its possible immunoadjuvant activity. immunization protocols utilizing immunogenic preparations that were likely to induce polarized th2-dependent immune responses, namely leishmania promastigote extract  and al <dig> gel-adsorbed le  <cit> , were used. as described below, the injection of bae preferentially stimulated the th <dig> component of the anti-le and the anti-bae immune responses in the immunized mice.

RESULTS
anti-le antibody levels
the addition of bae to the antigenic preparations  <dig> gel-adsorbed le) led to significantly increased levels of serum anti-le igg2a antibodies in the immunized mice  <dig> + bae") in relation to the corresponding control mice that did not receive bae 3"). the co-administration of bae also led to a statistically significant increase in anti-le igg <dig> antibodies in the le-immunized mice that have not received al <dig>  in relation to the mice that were immunized only with le, without adjuvants . however, the addition of bae to the al3-adsorbed le preparation led to a statistically significant decrease in igg <dig> anti-le antibody levels in the immunized mice  <dig> + bae"), in relation to the mice that were immunized with al3-adsorbed le without bae 3"). the results obtained with the use of bae as adjuvant did not differ significantly from the results obtained with the use of cfa as adjuvant, both for igg2a or igg <dig> antibody levels . however, mice immunized with le associated with both bae and al <dig>  <dig> + bae") had significantly lower levels of anti-le igg <dig> antibodies than mice immunized with cfa-emulsified le .

cytokine responses in non-stimulated and in le- and bae-stimulated cultures
when stimulated in vitro with le, the splenocytes from the mice that were immunized with le and received bae as adjuvant  produced significantly higher concentrations of interferon γ  than the splenocytes from the mice that were immunized with le without bae . the same result was observed when the mice were immunized with al3-adsorbed le and received bae as adjuvant  <dig> + bae"). when stimulated in vitro with le, the splenocytes from these mice produced significantly higher concentrations of ifn-γ than the splenocytes from mice that were immunized with al <dig> gel-adsorbed le without bae 3"). the amounts of ifn-γ produced by splenocytes of the mice that received bae, i.e., the mice that were immunized either with le in the presence of bae  or with al3-adsorbed le also in the presence of bae  <dig> + bae"), were comparable to those produced by splenocytes from the mice that were immunized with cfa-emulsified le .

the production of interleukin  <dig> by le-stimulated splenocytes was either not altered by the addition of bae to the immunogenic preparations , or was significantly reduced  <dig> gel-adsorbed le; figure 2b, group "le-al <dig> + bae", p <  <dig> , mann-whitney u test), in relation to the corresponding control mice that did not receive bae 3", respectively).

the production of ifn-γ, and not of il- <dig>  was significantly higher in bae-stimulated cultures of splenocytes from bae-immunized mice, than in splenocyte cultures from saline-treated control mice . spleen cells from the mice that had been immunized with bae spontaneously produced, ex vivo, more ifn-γ than control saline-treated mice . no statistically significant difference in the spontaneous production of il- <dig> by splenocytes of bae-immunized and saline-treated mice was observed .

no statistically significant differences in il- <dig> production by unstimulated, le-stimulated, or bae-stimulated splenocytes from the immunized and the non-immunized mice were observed .

nitric oxide production
the concentrations of nitric oxide in splenic cell supernatants from mice of the groups immunized with bae or with bae-containing preparations  <dig> + bae) were significantly higher than in those from mice of the corresponding control groups, which were treated with saline only or immunized with preparations without bae  <dig>  respectively). the concentrations of nitric oxide in splenic cell supernatants from the positive control mice, which were immunized with cfa-emulsified le , were also higher than the nitric oxide concentrations in splenic cell supernatants from mice of their corresponding control group .

discussion
the purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy, as immunological adjuvant, of an aqueous extract of the babassu mesocarp. this adjuvant activity was investigated with the bae in two different formulations: in soluble form or adsorbed to al <dig>  in both cases, its injection in mice stimulated a th1-dependent immune response, both to itself or to le, as demonstrated by:  a marked increase in circulating anti-le igg2a antibodies;  an increased in vitro production of ifn-γ by le-or bae-stimulated splenocytes;  an increased ex vivo production of ifn-γ by unstimulated splenocytes, and  an increased ex vivo production of nitric oxide by splenic cells. as expected, the immunization of balb/c mice with le alone led to the significant production of il- <dig> by le-stimulated splenocytes  <cit> . the addition of bae to the le did not significantly augment this il- <dig> production. this finding, therefore, does not support the possibility that, in addition to promoting th <dig> immune responses, the bae also enhances th <dig> immune responses. on the other hand, a reduction in il- <dig> production by the antigen-stimulated splenocytes, which could be expected from a th1-polarising adjuvant, was not seen in these mice. however, additional results indicate that the bae does preferentially enhance th <dig> immune responses, and even reduces a th2-dependent immune response. first, the addition of bae to the immunogenic preparation significantly reduced the production of il- <dig> by splenocytes from mice immunized with al3-adsorbed le. the reason why it would exert this inhibitory effect on the il- <dig> production only when the anti-le immune response is concomitantly stimulated by al <dig> is not clear. it would not be surprising, however, that the le and the al <dig> would promote th <dig> immune responses through different mechanisms, and it is possible that the al3-induced mechanism could be more easily inhibited by immune manipulation than the le-induced mechanism. second, in mice injected with bae alone, a recall immune response to antigens that were present in the bae was observed. this response was characterized by significantly increased production of ifn-γ, and no significant differences in il- <dig> production, by the mouse splenocytes when they were subjected to stimulation with bae in vitro, in relation to the splenocytes of saline-injected control mice. an ifn-γ response was already significantly taking place in vivo, since splenocytes from the bae-immunized mice spontaneously produced significant amounts of ifn-γ, and not of il- <dig>  ex vivo, in relation to splenocytes from control, saline-treated mice.

no differences in il- <dig> levels in the supernatants of splenocytes from mice that were injected with bae, in relation to splenocytes from control mice, were observed. this finding, which indicates that bae is not inducing leukocytes to produce il- <dig>  could perhaps contribute to the stimulative effect of bae on ifn-γ-producing immune responses, since il- <dig> would tend to down regulate those immune responses  <cit> .

the addition of bae to the le preparation also led to an increased production of igg <dig> antibodies, apparently conflicting with the absence of increased il- <dig> production by in vitro-stimulated splenocytes. however, igg <dig> antibodies in mice have been shown to constitute two different molecular sub-populations, one which can sensitize mast cells and is dependent on il- <dig> for its production, and another that does not bind to mast cells and depends on the th1-inducing il- <dig> cytokine to be produced  <cit> . thus, whereas the presence of igg2a antibodies can be considered a marker of an ifn-γ - producing th <dig> immune response in most mouse strains, including the balb/c  <cit> , the implication of the presence of igg <dig> antibodies, in terms of the nature of the underlying immune response, is much less clear.

in this study, the th <dig> immune response-promoting activity of bae was shown in mice of the balb/c strain, which are th2-biased  <cit> . it could be expected, therefore, that the th1-promoting effect would be even more pronounced in other strains of mice.

aluminium compounds are the most widely employed adjuvants for human beings  <cit> . their effectiveness is associated with a deposit formation in the site of administration  <cit> . the mechanism responsible for the adsorption of antigenic proteins to aluminium adjuvants involves electrostatic forces and hydrophobic interactions, among other physicochemical phenomena  <cit> . however, the use of aluminium compounds as adjuvants is limited by their failure to stimulate cellular immune responses, including those mediated by cytotoxic t cells  <cit> . these compounds are known to induce a th <dig> rather than th <dig> immune responses  <cit> , whereas cfa, not licensed for use in human beings, usually induces a mixed th1-th <dig> response  <cit> . these properties were confirmed in the present work.

the protective responses against some intracellular pathogens, such as leishmania and mycobacterium, are mediated by th <dig> cells, both in mice  <cit>  and in human beings  <cit> . there is, therefore, a need for highly efficacious, atoxic, th1-promoting adjuvants, to be used in vaccine preparations against these and other pathogens. the th <dig> cytokine profile induced by bae qualifies it as a promising candidate to become one of these adjuvants. indeed, the use of bae as adjuvant led to increased in vitro production of ifn-γ and nitric oxide by splenocytes, and both these biologically active molecules have been shown to be positively involved in the intracellular killing of leishmania and mycobacterium  <cit> . in the case of leishmania, however, the present results suggest that particular parasite antigens that do not induce th <dig> immune responses, either by their intrinsic nature or by amino-acid sequence manipulation, should be used.

advantages of the bae, when compared with other adjuvants, include the ample availability of the babassu mesocarp, and its low cost of manufacture and ease of formulation. the data presented herein justifies further studies to identify the biologically active molecule in the bae. since th <dig> cytokines may inhibit the development of th <dig> immune responses  <cit> , the induction of th <dig> immune responses by bae may therefore also be useful in the control of diseases that are mediated by th <dig> immune responses, such as allergic asthma and rhinitis.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the present findings, it was possible to conclude that:  bae promotes preferentially a th1-dependent immune response in a th2-prone strain of mice;  bae, and/or biologically active molecules derived from it, deserve to be further investigated as possible adjuvants in candidate vaccines for leishmaniases and other diseases caused by intracellular pathogens, and possibly in the immunotherapy of diseases that are mediated by th <dig> immune responses, such as allergic asthma and rhinitis.
