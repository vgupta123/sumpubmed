BACKGROUND
rust fungi are a large group of obligately biotrophic basidiomycete fungi that completely depend on their living host tissue for growth and reproduction. wheat  is a host to three different rust fungi, causing stripe , leaf  and stem  rust. wheat stripe rust, caused by puccinia striiformis westend. f. sp. tritici eriks. , is a serious problem in all major wheat growing countries  <cit> . in the united states, the disease is most destructive in the western united states and has become increasingly important in the south-central and south-eastern states  <cit> . unlike the stem rust  and leaf rust  fungi, pst does not have a known alternate host to complete the sexual cycle. during infection, urediniospores of pst germinate on wheat leaf surfaces to produce germ tubes. depending upon the isolate, pst forms noticeable or unnoticeable appressoria  <cit> , from which an infection peg is formed and penetrates a leaf stoma, followed by infection hyphae that form haustorial mother cells, and a specialized infection structure called the haustorium forms and an intimate feeding relationship is established. haustoria are essential for rust fungi to take nutrients from their host  <cit>  and have also been shown to be involved in vitamin synthesis  <cit> .

plant disease resistance relies on the recognition of pathogen avirulence  gene products by host resistance  genes through either direct  or indirect  association, which induces defense responses. haustoria play an essential role in the reactions of plants with rust fungi. for example, four avirulence genes from melampsora lini, the flax rust pathogen, have been cloned and found to encode small secreted proteins expressed in the fungal haustoria  <cit> . a large number of plant-induced and haustorium-specific genes have been identified in the bean rust fungus uromyces fabae  <cit> . to date, there are no reports of cloning and molecular characterization of either virulence or avirulence genes from any of the cereal rust pathogens.

the stripe rust fungus lacks several features to be an ideal model system for genetic analysis. it does not have a known alternate host for completing the sexual cycle. like the other cereal rusts, pst is very difficult to culture in vitro and stable transformation systems are yet to be developed. while molecular and genetic approaches are currently lacking, some advances are being made in genomics. recently ling et al.  <cit>  constructed a full-length cdna library of pst from rna extracted from urediniospores and identified some genes encoding protein products that maybe involved in virulence or infection. some genes highly expressed in germinated urediniospores of the fungus were also reported  <cit> . our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying infection and development within host tissue is still very limited. a haustorium is a hub of cellular communication between the host and the pathogen for the establishment of a biotrophic relationship. to gain some insights into haustorium-related functions and investigate pst virulence mechanisms, we constructed a pst haustorial cdna library based on a protocol for the preparative isolation of haustoria from rust-infected leaves  <cit>  and searched for expressed sequence tags  encoding putative secreted proteins. more than  <dig>  ests from the haustorial cdna library were generated. fifteen unique sequences were predicted to encode proteins secreted from haustoria. quantitative real-time pcr  studies revealed that some cdnas were specifically expressed in planta.

RESULTS
construction of a haustorial cdna library
stripe rust haustoria were isolated from heavily infected wheat leaves. total rna was extracted from haustoria of race pst- <dig> of pst and a cdna library was constructed with the pdnr-lib vector. most of the cloned cdna inserts in this library were between 300- <dig>  bp in size. a total of  <dig>  random cdna clones were sequenced from the 5' end, from which  <dig>  high quality ests were obtained. while the sequencing reactions covered the full inserts of many of the smaller clones,  <dig> of the clones with larger inserts were also sequenced from the 3' end.

est sequence analysis
the est sequences were subjected to blast searches . of the  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  sequences were found to be likely of plant origin as indicated by significant blast scores  to plant sequences but little or no homology to other organisms. after removing contaminating plant sequences,  <dig>  sequences were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences, of which  <dig> were singletons and  <dig> were contigs represented by multiple clones at frequencies ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  a majority of the contigs contained two, three or four sequences. the frequency of redundant ests was shown in figure  <dig>  the average g+c content of these unique sequences was  <dig> %, which was similar to the g+c content of ests in p. graminis and pst germinated urediniospores  <cit> . the sequences were deposited in the ncbi dbest sequence database .

all unique sequences were used in homology searches of the ncbi non-redundant protein sequences and the p. graminis genome database using the blastx and blastn algorithm. unique sequences with significant homology  to known proteins were grouped according to their putative functions . of the  <dig>  unique sequences, only  <dig>  showed significant similarities to proteins of known function,  <dig>  showed significant similarities to predicted proteins of unknown function and  <dig>  showed no significant similarity to a database entry. based on the examination of the significant sequence similarity to a database entry, a putative functional category was assigned to the specific unisequence. the majority of the genes were predicted to code for proteins of unknown function . the largest group of genes with known functions showed similarities to ribosomal proteins, followed by the group of genes with similarities to proteins involved in primary metabolism and energy production. some unisequences matched ests from pst urediniospores  <cit>  and germinated urediniospores  <cit>  deposited in the genbank. some had high homology to ests from a haustorium-specific cdna library of u. fabae  <cit> .

prediction of ests encoding secreted proteins
to identify putative secreted proteins from the haustorial cdna library, we selected unisequences that appeared to code for full-length open reading frames and predicted their translation products. predicted proteins from open reading frames with in-frame stop codons before the start codon were analyzed with the signal p  <dig>  algorithm  <cit>  and ipsort  <cit> . the analysis identified  <dig> unisequences encoding proteins with secretion signal peptides at the n-terminus . these sequences were predicted to encode proteins ranging in size from 56- <dig> amino acids. seven of them did not show significant homology to known protein sequences, seven matched predicted proteins of unknown function and one had significant homology to sulfate transporters. eight encoded cys-rich proteins with more than 5% cystein residues in the predicted protein.

expression patterns of genes from haustorial cdna library
to examine developmental stage-specific gene expression, ten unisequences were selected from the haustorial cdna library to assay their transcript levels during different developmental and infection stages through qrt-pcr. as determined by the genorm analysis, elongation factor- <dig>  Î²-tubulin and actin showed m values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . elongation factor- <dig> was the most stable gene and was therefore used as a reference to normalize gene expression across different samples. gene expression of the ten genes in uninfected wheat leaves, urediniospores, in vitro germinated urediniospores and infected wheat leaves was shown in table  <dig>  among these genes, six were putative secreted proteins . pstha5a <dig> was specifically expressed in plants and was either not expressed in urediniospores and germinated urediniospores or expressed very weekly. expression levels of pstha2a <dig> and pstha12j <dig> were weak in urediniospores, slightly increased in germinated urediniospores and high in pst-infected leaves. pstha12h <dig> was expressed in all stages of development, with the highest levels in infected leaves. pstha12a <dig> transcripts only increased in germinated urediniospores but not in infected leaves. in contrast, pstha9f <dig> was expressed strongly in urediniospores and germinated urediniospores, and its expression decreased dramatically in infected leaves.

the other four genes for which expression patterns were examined were a thi2p homolog , a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase  <dig> homolog , a predicted chitinase  and a ubiquitin ligase e3c homolog . pstha14i <dig> was expressed with the highest level in infected leaves. pstha14i <dig> was homologous to u. fabae pig <dig>  which was thought to be involved in vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis  <cit> . a similar in planta induced rust gene was also reported in p. triticina, a wheat leaf rust pathogen  <cit> . transcripts for pstha5a <dig> were detected only in plants, while pstha5g <dig> and pstha11n <dig> were down regulated in infected leaves. none of these genes had transcripts in uninfected wheat leaves , indicating that they were indeed pst genes.

discussion
haustoria are specialized structures that are formed within the living cell of a host by biotrophic fungal pathogens during infection. previous analyses of haustorial transcripts from other rust fungi  <cit>  indicated that they are rich in sequences induced in planta and involved in virulence as well as other aspects of parasitism, like nutrient uptake. in the present study, we constructed a cdna library from the wheat pathogen p. striiformis f. sp. tritici haustoria. a total of  <dig>  randomly chosen ests were generated which represented  <dig>  unique transcripts once plant sequences were removed and redundancies eliminated. most of the highly redundant sequences, like several coding for ribosomal proteins, were very similar to other fungal sequences in databases and/or sequences found in pst urediniospore and germinated urediniospore cdna libraries and a u. fabae haustorium-specific cdna library  <cit> . proteins involved in protein synthesis, primary metabolism and energy production were most prevalent in predicted proteins with known functions. similar findings were also reported in other pathogenic interactions during infection  <cit> . overall, the less redundant sequences were surprisingly unique, especially considering the database searches included nucleotide and predicted protein searches of the p. graminis f. sp. tritici genome sequence and nucleotide searches of the melampsora larici-populina genome sequence. approximately 64% of the  <dig>  unique sequences did not show significant similarities to known genes in databases. the frequency of sequences with no matches would likely have been lower if the full sequence of the cdnas were available; some sequences appeared mostly non-coding. however, this frequency was not only high compared to other fungi  <cit>  but also higher than that observed for pst libraries made from urediniospores  <cit>  or germinated urediniospores  <cit> . avirulence proteins from eukaryotic plant pathogens described to date have indicated that they are diverse in function and have "novel" sequences with little sequence similarity to proteins of known function. if genes expressed in haustoria are more likely involved in virulence, which is probably more specific to particular fungal species, this might explain why a high percentage of genes expressed in haustoria share little or no sequence similarity to genes in other fungi.

several of the haustorial transcripts were predicted to encode products homologous to potential virulence-related proteins based on sequence comparison with other plant or animal pathogens. for example, pstha15i <dig> was homologous to glutamine synthetase. several studies have indicated that glutamine metabolism is important for the virulence of various pathogens  <cit> . glutamine synthetase enzyme activities were detected in pathogenic species of mycobacterium, but were not detected in non-pathogenic species, indicating that this activity is potentially involved in the pathogenicity  <cit> . the glutamine synthetase of u. fabae was more strongly expressed in planta than in germinated urediniospores  <cit> . pstha15b <dig> is a putative lpd gene encoding dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. the mutant of the lpd gene in mycoplasma gallisepticum resulted in reduced virulence  <cit> .

several unisequences were candidates for genes encoding the key components of conserved signaling pathways. pstha18c <dig>  pstha10l <dig> and pstha12p <dig> were found to encode camp-dependent protein kinase type  <dig>  protein ras- <dig> precursor and protein phosphatase pp2a regulatory subunit b, respectively. camp-dependent protein kinase pathway elements are remarkably conserved and effects on virulence have been the focus of many studies. in cryptococcus neoformans, the camp signaling cascade is required for both melanin and capsule production, and mating filaments. all elements of the camp cascade are essential for the serum-induced switch of yeast to hyphal growth, which is important for the virulence of this fungus  <cit> . the camp cascade regulates pathogenicity of ustilago maydis <cit> . ras proteins belong to the rho family . the ras <dig> mutants of c. neoformans were avirulent in animals  <cit> . protein phosphatase pp2a is involved in several signal transduction pathways. disruption of rgb <dig> gene, a subunit of pp2a, in sclerotinia sclerotiorum reduced pathogenesis  <cit> . further investigations of these proteins in pst haustoria would be necessary to elucidate their functions in the infection process.

the fifteen unigenes predicted to encode secreted proteins are likely the best candidates for genes involved in specific virulence. many plant pathogens manipulate their hosts through delivery of effector proteins  <cit> . in contrast to host resistant proteins, rust and mildew avirulence gene products described to date often share no significant sequence similarity to proteins of known function  <cit> . about  <dig> avr genes in the flax rust pathogen have been identified by genetic analysis  <cit> . recently ellis and coworkers identified  <dig> hesps  genes by examining a m. lini haustorium transcripts for secretion signals  <cit> . among these hesps, three co-segregated with the independent avrm, avrp <dig> and avrp <dig> loci. transient expression assays have shown that these genes function as avirulence determinants to induce r gene-dependent cell death in flax  <cit> . this indicates that avirulence proteins are very abundant among proteins secreted from haustoria and thus the haustorial libraries are very useful tools for identifying them. in the present study, we identified  <dig> putative secreted proteins from haustoria. the sequences of these proteins provided few clues to their functions except for pstha21o <dig>  which had significant sequence similarity to a sulfate transporter. understanding the functions of these genes should shed light on the mechanisms of pst virulence and biotrophism. ongoing efforts to establish methods for stable transformation and transient expression assays in this biotrophic fungus are therefore a high priority.

CONCLUSIONS
a cdna library was constructed from rna of haustoria isolated from pst-infected wheat leaves. a total of  <dig>  est sequences of high quality were generated and assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences. approximately 64% of them showed no significant similarities in public databases, indicating that many are likely specific to certain puccinia taxa and valuable for future genomic studies of the stripe rust pathogen. most of the transcripts with known functions were predicted to encode ribosomal proteins involved in protein synthesis, followed by proteins of primary metabolism and energy production. some of the unisequences were predicted to encode products that exhibited high similarities to proteins potentially associated with virulence from other fungi. the  <dig> haustorium-specific genes predicted to encode secreted proteins are candidates for future studies to determine their potential functions in the wheat-pst interactions.
