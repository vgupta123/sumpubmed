BACKGROUND
brucellosis is one of the most serious zoonoses worldwide. it causes severe diseases in humans and substantial animal losses. in china, human brucellosis cases are increasing. in  <dig>   <dig>  new cases of human brucellosis have been reported according to chinese cdc , of them are mostly caused by brucella  melitensis infected sheep and goats or their products .

the 31–34 kda outer membrane protein  or  is a major membrane protein of brucellae except for b. abortus  <cit> . omp <dig> plays an important role in cellular and humoral immune protective responses against brucella infection . previously we fully evaluated omp <dig> epitopes in specific t-cell response in sheep vaccinated with attenuated b. melitensis vaccine  <cit> . however, the b-cell epitopes have not yet been extensively investigated. to date, only few epitopes recognized by antibodies to brucella omp <dig>  such as monoclonal antibody a59/10f09/g <dig> recognizing amino acid 48– <dig> of b. melitensis m <dig> and presenting protective activity were reported  <cit> . in this study, we generated and characterized  <dig> novel murine monoclonal antibodies  binding native omp <dig> of b. melitensis. some of these antibodies presented high reactivity with different epitopes of omp <dig>  suggesting potential capacity to identify omp <dig> antigens of brucellae or to detect b. melitensis or other brucella species beyond b. abortus.

RESULTS
production of mabs to omp <dig> of b. melitensis
a total of  <dig> mabs reactive with recombinant omp <dig>  were selected from screening of hybridomas by eia . antibody isotypes were identified for all  <dig> mabs, including 50%  igg2a, 23%  igg <dig> and 27%  igm, respectively.table  <dig> characterization of mabs reactive to the epitopes within omp <dig> of b. melitensis

classification of omp <dig> epitopes by mab’s recognition
in order to classify the omp <dig> antigenic epitopes, all mabs were tested for reactivity with  <dig> 16mer overlapping peptides derived from full-length amino acid  sequence, denatured or non-denatured protein forms of b. melitensis omp <dig> in various immunoassays. thirteen mabs were reactive with  <dig> linear peptides in peptide-elisa . twenty mabs were reactive to the denatured romp <dig> and  <dig> mabs to the denatured native membrane protein extract  by western blot , respectively. the mabs reactivity was also tested against the non-denatured native antigens in elisa using the nmp or the supernatant of sonicated proteins  from b. melitensis, which showed that  <dig> and  <dig> mabs were reactive, respectively .fig.  <dig> reactivity of mabs to omp <dig> antigens of b. melitensis.  binding of mabs to 16mer overlapping peptides derived from omp <dig> in peptide-elisa.  identification of mabs reacting with romp <dig> and nmp  by western-blot.  reactivity of mabs to nmp and ssp  by elisa. ns <dig>  an hcv ns <dig> peptide, recombinant protein and an un-related mab to hcv ns <dig> were used as negative-controls, respectively. the dotted line indicates the level of cut off defined as mean + 2sd of od value to negative controls




according to the nature of omp <dig> antigens recognized by  <dig> mabs, the epitopes were stratified into three groups of linear , semi-conformational  and conformational  forms. among these  <dig> mabs,  <dig> reacted with the linear epitopes,  <dig> reacted with the semi-conformational and  <dig> reacted with the conformational epitopes presented in either romp <dig> or native omp <dig> antigens of b. melitensis .

linear epitope mapping of omp <dig> by mabs
among seven reactive linear peptides , the epitope shared by peptides p <dig> and p <dig> was reactive with mabs 1h <dig>  2d <dig>  2g <dig> and 7a <dig>  however, due to the stronger reactivity with p <dig> than p <dig>  the minimal aa common sequence of omp <dig> was designated as epitope ep <dig>  . similarly, epitope ep <dig>  overlapped by peptides p <dig> and p <dig> reacted with mabs 2c <dig>  2e <dig>  4e <dig>  4h <dig> and 8f <dig>  epitope ep <dig>  reacted with both mabs 2a <dig> and 6d <dig>  epitopes ep <dig>  and ep <dig>  were recognized only by mab 5b <dig> or 5b <dig>  respectively . alignment of omp <dig> aa sequences showed that these five epitopes were completely conserved among b. melitensis, b. ovis, b. suis and b. canis except for a single aa mutation  within ep <dig> of b. ovis strains .fig.  <dig> mapping for linear epitopes of omp <dig> recognized by mabs. the amino acid  sequences of 16mer peptides reactive to the mabs are presented, of which the epitopes  are designated on the top of underlined aa sequences. aa position of omp <dig> is indicated at the beginning and the end of the peptide sequence. mabs are indicated below the epitopes they recognize

recognition of omp31-lentivirus transduced cells
to detect brucella omp <dig> intracellularly, 293ft cells were transduced by recombinant omp31-lentivirus  for mimicking brucella infection in human or animal cells. by using ifs, one igm mab  and  <dig> igg mabs were reactive to the expressed romp <dig> in transduced 293ft cells .fig.  <dig> recognition of lentivirus-mediated omp <dig> expressing cells by mabs in ifs. the lentivirus  transduced 293ft cells were stained by the ifs with individual mabs specific to omp <dig>  reactivity levels are estimated from immune-stained cells by the fluorescent density of strongly reactive , reactive  or non-reactive , respectively. lv-zsgreen is a negative control for lentivirus vector transduced cells; 293ft is a control of cells observed in white light under a nikon labophot photomicroscope




identification of brucella melitensis strains by mabs
to identify reactivity of mabs with omp <dig> on the membrane of bacteria, the intact b. melitensis strains were immunologically stained by ics with mabs, individually. of  <dig> mabs,  <dig> were reactive with intact b. melitensis bacteria by ics .fig.  <dig> identification of b. melitensis strain by mabs in ics. the intact bacteria of b. melitensis strain were stained in ics by individual mabs specific to omp <dig>   positive staining;  negative, indeterminate or control staining. gb, gram staining for bacterial control of b. melitensis strain viewed in white light under a microbiological microscope. nc = negative control for the ics with a mab to hcv ns3




based on cross-matching reactivity levels of mabs to the native omp <dig> antigen carrying different recognition epitopes,  <dig> igg <dig>  and  <dig> igg2a  clones presented high reactive profiles suitable as diagnostic antibodies in immunoassays of western-blot, elisa, ifs or ics . among six igm clones, mabs 2d <dig>  2b <dig> and 5f <dig> showed high-level reactivity in eias , making them more suitable as primary antibodies for capturing the omp <dig> antigen in serological tests. in contrast, mabs 6d <dig>  2a <dig> and 4h <dig> were unable or weakly to react with the native nmp, ssp or intact b. melitensis strains, suggesting that the recognizing epitopes might not be exposed on the protein surface of omp <dig> or brucella strains .

discussion
since omp <dig> was identified in b. melitensis  <cit> , most studies focused on its role in cellular immune protection against brucella infections  <cit> . although omp <dig> elicited specific antibody production and bactericidal activity  <cit> , it was considered a poor diagnostic antigen  <cit> . in this study, we prepared  <dig> murine mabs against omp <dig> of b. melitensis, of which 50%  were igg2a, 23%  igg <dig> and 27%  igm isotypes, respectively. in contrast, we previously found igg <dig> to be the majority of isotypes  of mabs to bp <dig> of b. melitensis  <cit> , which might in part explain why bp <dig> was a diagnostic antigen with higher reactivity to the sera from brucella infected humans or animals. in subclasses of antibodies, mice have igg <dig>  igg2a, igg2b and igg <dig>  which are functionally similar to human igg <dig>  igg <dig>  igg <dig> and igg <dig>  respectively. in general, igg <dig> is mainly associated with th <dig> but igg2a with th <dig> profiles . therefore, a higher population of igg2a induced by omp <dig> may confer th1-type immune protection against brucella infection through ifn-γ and up-regulating phagocytosis. however, bp <dig> mainly induced a major igg <dig> subclass antibody and functionally polarized th <dig> cells in brucella infection . the ratio of igg isotypes might be varied in relating to different antigenic properties of proteins.

besides cellular immune response, a specific monoclonal antibody to omp <dig>  was identified previously as a protective factor against b. melitensis or b. ovis infection in mice  <cit> . mab a59/10f09/g <dig> recognized a hydrophilic loop minimized within aa 48– <dig> of omp <dig>  which was exposed on the surface of pathogenic strains of b. melitensis, b. ovis and b. canis  <cit> . another study reported that  <dig> mabs obtained after immunization with truncated romp <dig> of b. ovis recognized epitopes localized at distant positions, such as aa48– <dig>  aa149– <dig> or aa180– <dig>  <cit> . in our study, we depicted characteristics of  <dig> mabs, and found that  <dig> mabs were reactive with linear epitopes and others with conformational or semi-conformational epitopes  <cit> . none of the mabs reacted with the same epitope as mab a59/10f09/g <dig>  however, we identified five new discreet epitopes  of omp <dig> mapped within  <dig> 16mer overlapping peptides, including ep <dig> , ep <dig> , ep <dig> , ep <dig>  and ep <dig>  . it remains to be investigated further whether some of mabs reacting with these epitopes have the ability to protect animals against b. melitensis or b. ovis infection.

in addition, epitopes ep <dig> and ep <dig> were considered as b-cell epitopes in the present study and shared its aa sequences with omp <dig> t-cell epitopes p <dig> and p <dig>  which were identified in sheep vaccinated with attenuated b. melitensis m5– <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, those mabs recognizing both b and t cell epitopes were all of igg <dig> isotype, while other mabs to b-cell epitopes  were igg2a isotype alone . a  <dig> amino acid polypeptide  was previously identified as both t and b cell epitopes inducing cellular and humoral response in mice, and the igg <dig> titer was higher than igg2a in sera  <cit> . however, it is still unknown whether there are significant discrepancies between igg <dig> and igg2a binding to b or t cell epitopes, or isotypes of mabs sharing reactivity with different types of epitopes. the mab a59/10f09/g <dig> was igg2a and reactive with a common epitope  of t and b cells  <cit> , this finding being inconsistent with the above description of epitopes mostly associated with igg <dig> 

a recent study reported a monoclonal antibody-based b. melitensis lipopolysaccharide antigen detection by elisa  <cit> . in our study, the panel of  <dig> mabs to omp <dig> was tested to evaluate their reactivity with different forms of recombinant and native omp <dig> of b. melitensis, including intact bacteria and bacterial or cell extracts detected by western-blot, elisa, ifs and ics. data in table  <dig> showed that  <dig> igg and  <dig> igm clones of mabs had suitable ability for the detection of omp <dig> or brucella strains by diverse immunoassays. mabs 7a <dig>  5b <dig>  2c <dig>  5b <dig> and 5h <dig> reacted with different omp <dig> epitopes exposed on the surface of b. melitensis strain and identified by ics. few substitutions were found in alignments of omp <dig> aa sequences of b. melitensis, b. ovis, b. suis and b canis strains. the five new epitopes  identified in this study had conserved sequences except for a single aa mutation within ep <dig> , suggesting that these mabs could be used to detect at least four species of brucella strains. the ifs detection of intracellular brucellae might be an alternative assay of conventional bacterial culture for examination of brucella elimination by brucellosis treatment in clinical practice  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study identified  <dig> novel mabs specific to omp <dig> of b. melitensis. five igg and  <dig> igm clones presented high ability to recognize multiple epitopes of omp <dig> antigen, which were exposed on the protein surface of intact b. melitensis and highly conserved among b. melitensis, b. ovis, b. suis and b. canis strains. the monoclonal antibodies obtained in this study could provide a substantial help as key reagents in diagnostic tools for identifying brucella omp <dig> antigens in laboratory, or for detecting intracellular brucella melitensis and other brucella species beyond b. abortus in clinical.
