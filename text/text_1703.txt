BACKGROUND
many northern-hemisphere forests are dominated by evergreen and deciduous oaks . the genus quercus consists of about  <dig> species extending over a wide range of environmental conditions, from temperate to subtropical regions. some sympatric species  occupy different ecological niches  <cit>  and are therefore interesting models for studies of plant adaptation  <cit>  and ecological speciation  <cit> . an important question in biological science concerns the response of these long-lived organisms to rapid environmental change, their ability to evolve and the mechanisms involved. the genes and associated structural and expressional variants required for adaptation must be identified if we are to address these questions. to this end, a number of genomic tools and resources have been developed for oaks , including two bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries  <cit> , a large number of ssrs  <cit>  that have been used to generate linkage maps  <cit>  and expressed sequence tags , mostly obtained by sanger and roche  <dig> sequencing  <cit> . researchers can now use these tools to address concerns about the adaptability of forest trees at the genomic level. however, studies aiming to address this objective have been hampered by a lack of genomic resources. ultra-deep sequencing methods, in particular, could help to expand the oak transcript catalog for studies of the genomic mechanisms underlying plastic responses and evolutionary adaptation to environmental change. rna-seq is a method of choice for quantifying gene expression  <cit> , and for identifying genes preferentially expressed at specific developmental stages  <cit>  or in specific physiological conditions  <cit> . rna-seq can be used to infer gene regulatory networks on the basis of enrichment analysis for pathways and gene ontology groups  <cit> , using established knowledge from model organisms  <cit> , or with dedicated statistical approaches  <cit>  for the de novo identification of sets of co-expressed genes. in this study, rnaseq was used to identify genes regulated during bud dormancy release, an important phase of vegetative bud phenology, known to be strongly affected by temperature and photoperiod and therefore, likely to be greatly disturbed by the unprecedented warming associated with climate change  <cit> . low temperatures are essential to overcome endo-dormancy , but high temperatures are also required for bud break . the effect of climate change, with milder autumns and warmer winters, on the timing of bud flush and the impact of exposure to late spring frost are key questions in forestry requiring a detailed understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms  involved in dormancy release. we addressed these questions, by studying the dynamics of gene expression over this critical period, focusing on two successive phases of bud dormancy release: i) eco-dormancy, a dormancy state prevailing in late winter and spring imposed by environmental conditions unfavorable for growth , and ii) swelling bud, which occurs in spring, just before bud burst, when the heat requirement for bud break is almost satisfied.

once established, transcriptome analysis can also be used in a comparative framework, to reveal some of the evolutionary features of a genome, through the inference of whole-genome duplication and speciation events, for example  <cit> . it has been proposed that modern eudicots have derived from a founder ancestral genome structured in  <dig> protochromosomes followed by series of whole genome duplications  or polyploidizations and ancestral chromosome fusions and fissions  <cit> . polyploidization has been proposed as a key evolutionary mechanism in providing new genetic material leading to morphological and phenotypic innovations through neo and/or subfunctionalizations of duplicated gene pairs  <cit> . to this regards, how the twelve modern oak chromosomes evolved from the eurosid ancestor with respect to duplication and chromosome rearrangement patterns is still largely unknown. in this context, the main objectives of this study were: i) to enlarge the current oak est resource through the use of ultrahigh-throughput sequencing technology and to combine the data obtained with available sequences expressed in different tissues, at different developmental stages, and in response to different biotic and abiotic stresses, to generate the most comprehensive annotated unigene set for oak, and ii) to use this resource to increase our understanding of the structure, function  and macroevolution of the oak genome.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly of the oak transcriptome
transcriptomes are a valuable genomic resource for studies in non-model organisms for which genome sequences are not available, because they are smaller and less complex than genomes. the de novo assembly of transcriptome sequence data from a single sequencing platform has become a routine task, and a handful of de novo transcriptome assemblers have been developed  <cit> , but combining the outputs from multiple sequencing platforms remains challenging  <cit>  and involves the use of suitable assembler software for different types of datasets . in this study, we used a combination of sanger, roche- <dig> and illumina technologies and bioinformatic tools to generate a catalog of oak transcripts from rna obtained from different tissues, developmental stages and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses . long and short reads were assembled independently, with robust assemblers  and the resulting assemblies were combined to produce a final meta-assembly . the main characteristics of these two pre-assemblies and the final meta-assembly are summarized in table 1a.figure  <dig>

long-read pre-assembly
the sequencing of  <dig> and  <dig> cdna libraries with sanger and  <dig> technologies  resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> trimmed reads respectively. the distribution of trimmed ests is shown in additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  putative fl-cdna clones  sequenced with the illumina/solexa ga-ii x , yielded  <dig> , <dig> paired end reads. then, de novo assembly with velvet and tgicl software yielded  <dig>  contigs. by combining sanger, roche- <dig> and reconstructed fl-cdna data, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> long sequences used to construct a long-read pre-assembly with mira. we finally obtained  <dig>  contigs, with a mean sequence length of 937 bp .

short-read pre-assembly
a total of  <dig> , <dig> illumina reads ,  <dig> % corresponding to illumina sequences generated in the present study, allowed to generate a short-read pre-assembly of  <dig>  contigs with a mean sequence length of 877 bp .

meta-assembly
the meta-assembly was generated with mira. using the  <dig>  pre-assembly contigs , we obtained a final assembly  consisting of  <dig>  contigs, which is available from the quercus portal . in total,  <dig>   and  <dig>   contigs yielded significant hits with the oak chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes, respectively. the mean contig size for ocv <dig> was  <dig>  bp  which is close to the mean gene length in eukaryotes . by assembling short and long reads together in a single unigene set, we were able to improve the first oak transcriptome assembly  established by ueno et al.  <dig>  <cit>  from sanger and roche- <dig> reads . simultaneously, we improved ocv <dig> recently established for a single q. robur genotype . it is difficult to compare the size of the meta-assembly  with those of other projects with similar aims and approaches, because it is influenced by genome and transcriptome sizes, the diversity of tissues/developmental stages/environmental conditions, the number of cdna sequences produced, and the assembly method used. however, if we consider recent studies on forest trees, the ocv <dig> meta-assembly is of a similar size to those of pseudotsuga menziesii  and pinus pinaster , larger than that of castanea molissima , and smaller than of pinus contorta .

functional annotation
sequence similarity to swissprot accessions and other plant proteomes
we characterized the oak transcriptome by a similarity-based approach, using proteomes of closely related plant species and swissprot accessions. we used the blastx algorithm to align the  <dig>  ocv <dig> contigs with these proteomes, and obtained a significant match for  <dig>  oak contigs . similar numbers of hits were obtained with the selected gene models:  <dig>  hits in arabidopsis thaliana , the species most phylogenetically distant from quercus considered, to  <dig>  hits in prunus persica, the closest species considered . ocv <dig> contigs matched a total of  <dig>  different swissprot accessions and between  <dig>   and  <dig>   sequences in plant gene models. the number of oak contigs displaying similarity in terms of deduced amino-acid sequences with the content of at least one of the databases studied  was much greater than the number of genes present in oak . this overestimation may be due to contig redundancy, contig fragmentation , unassembled alleles, particularly for highly polymorphic diploid species of this type, with a mean of one snp or indel every 25–30 bp  <cit> , splicing variants, sequencing errors, or sequence read misattribution between closely related paralogs due to the presence of recently duplicated genes. we found that the  <dig>  prunus persica gene model sequences with a hit in ocv3-91 k matched, on average,  <dig>  oak contigs each, highlighting the redundant nature of ocv3-91 k. however, we also found that  <dig>   of the matched prunus gene model sequences displayed 75% coverage with a single oak contig each, indicating that many of the oak genes for which a closely related gene was present in peach were well assembled. however, paralog assembly may also have contributed to erroneous gene predictions. in the species with the closest phylogenetic relationship to quercus analyzed here  more than  <dig>  different genes were tagged, corresponding to about two thirds of the protein-coding genes of oak.table  <dig>

the remaining  <dig>  contigs without blastx hits in swissprot or the selected plant gene models  were then aligned  with the nr protein database and the genome sequence of prunus persica . only  <dig> % of these contigs could be aligned with sequences in the nr protein database. these contigs also diverged much more than the ocv3-91 k subset  from the prunus persica genome. matches to the prunus persica genome sequence were obtained for 59% of the ocv3-91 k contigs but only  <dig> % of the ocv3-101 k contigs. moreover, we successfully mapped  <dig>  ocv3-91 k and only  <dig>  ocv3-101 k contigs onto  <dig>  and  <dig>  prunus persica gene models, respectively . the number of exons per gene model was three times higher for ocv3-91 k than for ocv3-101 k. all together, these results indicate that ocv3-101 k consisted mostly of non-coding rna. besides, ocv3-91 k contained  <dig>   contigs supported by short reads only, whereas ocv3-101 k contained  <dig>   such contigs. the shorter mean size of contigs in ocv3-101 k may also have resulted in the presence of less biological meaningful information. indeed, mean and median contig sizes were three times greater in ocv3-91 k than in ocv3-101 k , consistent with the presence of a larger amount of valuable information for functional characterization of the oak transcriptome in ocv3-91 k. we therefore concentrated on ocv3-91 k for subsequent analyses.table  <dig>

functional annotation and go classification of oak transcripts
we assigned functions to the ocv3-91 k contigs with the gene ontology  classification, which provides a standardized set of terms to describe the genes and gene products of different species. first, we designated functions for each contigs on the basis of matches with the pfam database. a total of  <dig>  go terms to  <dig>  contigs  were identified. a second series of go annotation was based on the goa database. for the  <dig>  ocv3-91 k contigs giving significant matches to a. thaliana proteins,  <dig>   were annotated with at least one go term. we retrieved the functional categories associated with their best blast hits in swissprot, and this yielded  <dig>  go terms for  <dig>  contigs. based on best blast hit results, we were able to associate  <dig>  contigs with go terms in this second round. overall, at least one go term was assigned to  <dig>  contigs  ;  <dig>  of these contigs  were associated with go terms from both series,  <dig> contigs  were associated with go terms from the first series, and  <dig>  contigs  were associated with go terms from the second series. for the  <dig>  contigs associated with at least one go term,  <dig>  were associated with  <dig>  go terms  for biological processes  ,  <dig>  were associated with  <dig> go terms  for cellular components  and  <dig>  were associated with  <dig> go terms  for molecular functions  , accounting for a total of  <dig>  go terms . these proportions are similar to those in the goa database:  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   go terms for bp, cc and mf, respectively. setting the gene ontology graph level to  <dig> decreased the number of go terms considerably, to  <dig> for bp,  <dig> for cc and  <dig> for mf . the most abundant go slim terms were cellular process , binding  and cell , for bp, mf and cc, respectively. comparing the ranking of the main go terms with those for other phylogenetically related species  and more distantly related species , a remarkable match was found for the go category molecular functions, for which sufficient comparable data were available for the four species . these results suggest that a large proportion of the plant’s genes were present in ocv3-91 k. finally, it would be tempting to highlight the differences in functional classes between the ocv3-91 k sequences associated with go terms and at go annotations. however, we believe that such an analysis would be misleading, given the complex nature of any transcript catalog. we will wait until the generation of an oak gene model before carrying out such analyses, to avoid making erroneous predictions  <cit> .figure  <dig>

comparative genomics and the detection of conserved orthologous sequences common to peach
the rosids comprise two major clades of orders  <cit> : the fabids  and the malvids . quercus species are fabids and are relatively closely related to prunus . blastx alignment of the ocv3-91 k contigs with the malvid , fabid  and basal rosid  gene models  demonstrated that evolutionary relationships  between oak and fabid representatives  were stronger than those between oak and malvid representatives . in particular,  <dig>  ocv-91 k contigs yielded blastx hits with prunus persica  model genes,  <dig>  of which  were located on eight major scaffolds corresponding to the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. these  <dig>  orthologous sequences  delivered the following chromosomal relationship density: chromosome #1:  <dig>  peach genes / <dig>  oak orthologs , chromosome #2:  <dig> / <dig> , chromosomes #3:  <dig> / <dig> , chromosome #4:  <dig> / <dig> , chromosome #5:  <dig> / <dig>  chromosome #6:  <dig> / <dig>  chromosome #7:  <dig> / <dig> , chromosome #8:  <dig> / <dig> figure  <dig>

this similarity in genome organization between oak and peach was used as an input to highlight the collinearity between the oak and peach genomes and to investigate whether genetic information from one species can be transferred to another, particularly as concerns phenology-related qtls. in particular, further genetic mapping of the  <dig>  characterized cos markers between oak and peach will immediately illuminate the synteny relationships with the malvids and fabids and ultimately evolutionary history of the  <dig> oak chromosomes from the eudicot ancestral genome reported as structured in  <dig> protochromosomes. finally the delivered heterologous oak/peach map offer the opportunity to select oak genes either covering the entire peach genome or specifically located in a peach locus of interest related to a specific agronomic trait.

expression pattern for oak transcripts
this analysis was based on the high-throughput sequencing  of six cdna libraries : ecodb, eco-dormant bud; swb, swelling bud; xy, secondary differentiating xylem; ro, root; le, leaf and ca, in vitro dedifferentiated callus. two approaches were used to determine the tissue-related expression of oak contigs. first, the contigs were classified according to the tissue of origin of their reads, and the tissues were clustered on the basis of their expression profiles. second, statistical tests were used to identify genes displaying significant differential expression between pairs of tissues. for biological interpretation, we focused on the comparison between two developmental stages of vegetative bud dormancy release: eco-dormancy  and swelling bud before bud break  . the reference for this analysis was the ocv3-91 k subset.table  <dig>

identification of transcripts differentially expressed across a panel of tissues
an inventory of the numbers of contigs present in several oak tissues or specific to a given tissue revealed that ro  made the greatest contribution to the ocv3-91 k contigs, with  <dig>   matching contigs . adding a second tissue  to the ro dataset further increased the number of contigs by  <dig> % . successive additional inclusions of le, ca, swb and xy increased the number of contigs by  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. we found that  <dig>  contigs  contained reads from all six tissues. these  <dig>  contigs were particularly long, with a mean length of  <dig>  bp. we also found that  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs contained reads from at least  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tissues, respectively. finally, in total,  <dig>  contigs were associated with a single tissue type:  <dig>  were specific to ro,  <dig>  to ecodb,  <dig> to le,  <dig> to ca,  <dig> to swb and  <dig> to xy). the mean length of these contigs was 684 bp . as expected, a large part of the transcriptome is shared by all tissues. nevertheless, sequencing of diverse tissues allowed to identify transcripts specific to each of them and was required for comparing expression level of genes involved in dormancy. the list of “tissue-specific” transcripts, with annotations, is provided in additional file  <dig>  these “tissue-specific” transcriptomes yielded valuable and specific additive information for inclusion in the catalog of oak transcripts, which can be accessed by interested scientists. normalized read counts are provided for ocv3-91 k and ocv3-101 k in additional file  <dig> 

tissues were then clustered according to their transcriptomic distances, based on the 91 k annotated contigs. two major groups were identified on the resulting dendrogram, shown in additional file  <dig>  the first cluster included tissues resulting from primary  and secondary  meristem activities. interestingly, encodb clustered more closely with xy than swb, suggesting that very different regulatory networks control these two phenological phases of bud dormancy release. in the second cluster the two highly specialized tissues, ro and le, clustered closer to each other than to ca, probably due to the very specific nature of the totipotent state of the in vitro dedifferentiated callus tissue.

we used three methods to identify contigs displaying differential expression between each pair of tissues: r statistics, edger, and deseq . ro and xy were ranked first in terms of the number of contigs with expression levels different from those in other tissues , whereas ecodb showed the lowest level of differential expression, particularly when compared with swb and xy, consistent with the clustering result. the results for in vitro callus tissue  were not consistent with our initial expectations, i.e. the expression of a much larger array of “specific” genes than the more specialized tissues, such as root, leaf or xylem.figure  <dig>

identification of candidate genes for differential expression during bud dormancy release
the mapping of the  <dig> , <dig> ecodb and  <dig> , <dig> swb paired-reads onto the ocv <dig> assembly was successful for  <dig> , <dig> ecodb reads and  <dig> , <dig> swb reads. the ecodb and swb reads were integrated into  <dig>  ocv <dig> contigs. the ecodb and swb reads were distributed between  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, respectively. reads from both libraries were simultaneously detected in  <dig>  contigs, whereas  <dig>  contigs contained reads from ecodb only and  <dig>  contigs contained reads from swb only. analysis of the  <dig>  integrated contigs with r statistics  identified  <dig>   contigs displaying differential expression , whereas the deseq and edger r bioconductor packages detected  <dig>  and  <dig>   differentially expressed contigs, respectively . only  <dig> contigs were identified by all three methods  and  <dig> contigs were identified by at least two statistical methods . in total,  <dig> of these  <dig> contigs belonged to ocv3-91 k. go term enrichment analysis was performed for these  <dig> differentially expressed contigs, with pathway studio software. both the gene and plant ontology databases were used.figure  <dig> 
venn diagram showing the number of differentially expressed genes during bud dormancy release identified by  <dig> statistical algorithms;  <dig>  differentially expressed contigs were identified by the r statistics method,  <dig> by deseq and  <dig>  by edger .




among the  <dig> contigs,  <dig> were found to be upregulated in ecodormant buds . for this first set of genes, enrichment analysis for pathways and groups  yielded  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hits for the biological process , cellular component  and molecular function  categories of the gene ontology database, respectively . the five bp terms displaying the highest level of enrichment corresponded to “ribosome biogenesis”, “translation”, “response to cold”, “response to water deprivation” and “response to cadmium ion”. similar results were reported by ueno et al. in  <dig>  <cit>  for  <dig> sequencing on eco-dormant buds. in this previous investigation, a forcing test was used to determine the dormancy status of the buds. no such test was carried out in our study. the similarity in bp terms between the two studies suggests that the buds analyzed here were also in the ecodormancy phase. the first five mf groups related to “structural constituent of ribosome”, “transmembrane receptor activity”, “calmodulin binding”, “translation factor activity”, “nucleic acid binding” and “nucleoside-triphosphate activity”. finally,  <dig> significant hits  were obtained against the plant ontology database, with the ontologies displaying the highest levels of differential expression corresponding to “guard cell”, “stamen”, “lp. <dig> eight leaves visible”, “lp. <dig> six leaves visible” and “male gametophyte”.

a total of  <dig> contigs were upregulated in swelling buds,  <dig> being “specific” to this phenological stage and  <dig> being more strongly expressed in swb than in ecodb . for this second set of genes,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> eapg hits  were obtained with the bp, cc and mf terms of the gene ontology database, respectively. the five bp categories displaying the highest level of enrichment were “dna-dependent dna replication initiation”, “regulation of cell cycle”, “dna unwinding involved in replication”, “cell cycle and microtubule-based movement activity”. the mf categories displaying the highest level of enrichment were “carboxylesterase activity”, “lipid binding”, “microtubule motor activity”, “dna-dependent atpase activity” and “cyclin-dependent protein kinase regulator activity”. finally,  <dig> significant hits  were obtained against the plant ontology database, the bp categories displaying the highest level of enrichment being “il. <dig> inflorescence just visible”, “pedicel”, “f mature embryo stage”, “expanded cotyledon stage” and “ <dig> anthesis groups”.

subnetwork enrichment analysis  was then performed for this set of  <dig> differentially expressed contigs . two distinct subnetworks were constructed from arabidopsis homologs of ecodb and swb contigs with pathway studio; they were merged, as presented in figure  <dig>  mean expression values shown in red  and blue  highlight the differences in central hubs and associated partners between these two phenological stages. eapg  on entities of these two subnetworks clearly supported our view that the gene expression patterns in eco-dormant and swelling buds were truly different. indeed, the central hubs identified during ecodormancy related mostly to resistance to cold stress and water deprivation, whereas those identified in swelling buds related mostly to cell division and development .figure  <dig>

discussion
the unigene set established in this study constitutes the most comprehensive transcript catalog assembled to date for the genus quercus. we have also used this resource to design a high-density snp array, and we have validated the snps detected in silico, by evaluated their mendelian segregation in four pedigrees and determining their level of diversity in four white european oak species  <cit> . we discuss here the ways in which this resource improves our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in vegetative bud dormancy release, by comparing the abundance of mrnas at two phenological stages: ecodormant buds and swelling buds just before bud break. this section therefore provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in dormancy release in pedunculate oak in light of both the ontologies and central hubs identified in the enrichment analysis . tissue specificity was also considered, in an attempt to identify specific markers of these two phenological stages.

transcripts upregulated during ecodormancy
in trees, ecodormancy occurs when unfavorable environmental conditions  prevent bud break in early spring. the molecular machinery involved in ecodormancy is poorly understood, but recent studies have reported an accumulation of transcripts relating to cold stress, water deprivation and hormonal stimuli  <cit> .

ribosome biogenesis
in total,  <dig> genes belonged to this functional category, a key component of the regulation of gene expression . thirteen of these genes were expressed in a bud-specific manner, but four were expressed in all the tissues studied. most of the bud-specific genes encoded proteins very similar to ribosomal proteins , but one  encoded a zinc-binding ribosomal protein. in plants, exposure to low temperatures rapidly leads to major changes in the proteome, probably driven to some extent by changes in ribosome biosynthesis modulated by changes in levels of expression of the structural components of ribosomes. degenhardt et al.  <cit>  reported that the two paralogs of the arabidopsis thaliana rpl <dig> gene  responded coordinately to developmental and stress stimuli, such as cold acclimation. a gene  encoding a plastid ribosome protein  was also identified in this functional category. prps are major components of the plastid ribosome. in  <dig>  song et al.  <cit>  showed, in a rice mutant with prp protein downregulated, that the accumulation of the corresponding transcript was strongly regulated by cold stress. they hypothesized that this gene was essential for normal chloroplast development during freezing tolerance.

in ecodormant buds, the cells have to deal with the instability of biomolecules. the synthesis of new ribosomes may facilitate maintenance of the translational machinery of the cell under unfavorable conditions. in the meantime, protein catabolism should eliminate malformed or non-functional proteins. we found significant enrichment for the term “ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process”, which was represented by five genes .

response to cold
in total,  <dig> genes belonged to this functional category, four of which were expressed specifically in buds, five of which were overexpressed in buds  and six of which were constitutively expressed . two relevant transcription factors for cold acclimation  were identified in this study. these transcription factors are known to regulate the expression of many cold-responsive genes  <cit>  promoting the initiation of cold acclimation and freezing tolerance in plants. their overexpression in ecodormant buds may therefore increase the tolerance of meristematic cells to low temperature. a los <dig> gene encoding a translation elongation factor 2-like protein was also identified in this category. this gene has been strongly implicated in the development of freezing tolerance in arabidopsis thaliana. guo et al.  <cit>  identified the los <dig> gene as a key regulator of the cbf1/dreb <dig> complex. indeed, they showed that a lack of expression of this gene led to a lack of translation of the cbf <dig> and dreb <dig> transcripts, resulting in the repression of genes involved in cold acclimation. several cold-responsive genes  were also identified, including lti <dig>  which encodes a dehydrin protein known to accumulate during cold stress. the expression of this gene is also tightly regulated by the cbf transcription factors  <cit>  and aba, an important hormone involved in seed dormancy. rci <dig>  which encodes a rare cold-inducible protein, was also identified. the precise role of rci genes in dormancy regulation remains unclear, but several studies have reported the accumulation of transcripts from these genes in the bud during dormancy  <cit> , suggesting a possible role in freezing tolerance. finally, a fib gene, encoding a fibrillin protein, was also identified. fibrillins are lipid-binding proteins known to accumulate under cold stress. it is thought that they may be involved in the photoinhibition of psii during cold stress  <cit> , thereby protecting the chloroplast against frost damage. this gene is also regulated by the cbf transcription factor  <cit> .

response to water deprivation
eight genes belonged to this functional category . one was specifically expressed in the bud , three were overexpressed in the bud  and four were constitutively expressed in all the tissues of the panel. some of these genes were also identified in the ontology terms corresponding to the response to cold stress, suggesting that some molecular functions are common to these two biological processes. atbi- <dig> encodes a bax inhibitor  <dig> protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. bax inhibitor genes were identified in both animals and plants. the precise molecular function of these genes is poorly understood, but they are probably involved in preventing the cell death induced by diverse biotic and abiotic stresses . this suggests that this gene may be involved in delaying cell death in the bud during cold stress, enabling the cell to cope with unfavorable environmental conditions. sip <dig> encodes cbl-interacting protein kinase  <dig>  once activated, the products of cbl genes transduce the calcium signal by phosphorylating downstream signaling components. he et al.  <cit>  reported that the cbl-interacting protein kinase  <dig> of cotton played a role in the drought stress response, through regulation of the expression of targeted genes. arabidopsis mutants constitutively expressing this gene are also characterized by an enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stress, suggesting a possible role of this transcription factor in adaptation to diverse abiotic stresses. finally, cbl <dig> encodes calcium sensor calcineurin b-like  <dig>  doğramaci et al.  <cit>  reported the involvement of this calcium sensor protein as a key component of the aba signaling pathway. mutant line overexpressing this gene was found to be hypersensitive to aba during seed germination and seedling growth.

response to gibberellin stimuli
five genes belonged to this functional category. three genes were overexpressed in the bud  and two were constitutively expressed . two of the genes identified  encode a ga-stimulated transcript  homolog. da silveira falavigna et al.  <cit>  reported the overexpression of gast genes in the dormant buds of apple trees. a similar result was also reported by doğramaci et al.  <cit>  for leafy spurge. the precise role of gast genes in dormancy regulation remains poorly understood, but these authors suggested a key role for gibberellin in dormancy regulation. the agl <dig> gene, another gene from this category, encoding a protein very similar to the agamous-like  <dig> protein, was also identified. agl- <dig> is a mads box gene that has been reported to encode an integrator of several environmental stimuli. its level of expression is correlated with flowering time in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . trainin et al.  <cit>  reported the possible involvement of polymorphism of this gene in the regulation of dormancy release in apricot, suggesting a possible role for agl <dig> in the breaking of dormancy.

response to high light intensity
three genes were identified in this category. one was specifically expressed in buds , one was overexpressed in bud  and one was constitutively expressed . bag proteins are much less well understood in plants than in animals. bag proteins are characterized by a bag domain that interacts with the atpase domain of hsp 70/hsc <dig>  in arabidopsis thaliana, bag proteins are encoded by an eight-member multigene family thought to be involved in programmed cell death through calcium signaling  <cit> . kobayashi et al.  <cit>  described a possible role for plant bag proteins in floral transition, through activation of the expression of the constans gene. to our knowledge, our study is the first to report the overexpression of this gene during ecodormancy.

transcripts upregulated in the swelling bud
the mechanisms underlying bud break have been less thoroughly studied than those underlying ecodormancy and endodormancy. the ontology terms associated with this subset of genes correspond to cell division , indicating a “restarting” of mitotic activity in the meristematic cells. this reinitiation of mitosis must occur before bud break, when environmental conditions become favorable.

dna-dependent dna replication initiation
five genes belonged to this category . none were specifically or preferentially expressed in the highly specialized tissues of the bud. four of these genes  encode proteins very similar to minichromosome maintenance proteins . in plants, mcm proteins have been implicated in cell division and are responsible for ensuring that the dna of the cell is replicated only once per cell division. mcm proteins are encoded by a six-member multigene family and they interact with each other to form a complex. mcm proteins are relatively well characterized in plants. we identified mcm <dig>  in this study, a gene that has been reported to be essential for normal plant growth and development  <cit> . dang et al.  <cit>  showed that its expression was induced during salt and cold stress. this gene is also strongly expressed in active dividing tissue, suggesting a major effect of mcm <dig> during cell cycle and proliferation  <cit> . a prolifera gene  was also found to be upregulated. prl also belongs to the mcm family and encodes an essential component of the dna replication apparatus operating during the s-phase of the cell cycle. this gene is known to be strongly expressed during plant development. springer et al.  <cit>  reported this gene to be particularly strongly expressed in dividing cells during embryo development. they subsequently  <cit>  showed that the prl gene was also expressed in the cells responsible for initiating flower primordia. finally, a cdc <dig> gene from this category was also identified. several authors have suggested that the product of the cdc <dig> gene may function with the mcm complex, because several genetic and biochemical interactions between these components have been reported . other authors  have demonstrated particular interactions between this gene and the mcm <dig> gene  in dna elongation during the cell cycle. these findings are consistent with a strong reinitiation of mitotic activity in the meristematic cells of the swelling bud, enabling the bud to burst when environmental conditions become favorable.

regulation of the cell cycle and cell division
this functional category was defined by merging two highly similar ontologies . it included  <dig> genes, but the redundancy rate was high because most of the cyclin  genes were present in both ontologies . as for the previous ontology, no gene was found to be specifically and preferentially upregulated in buds. cycd genes are known to be upregulated during the breaking of dormancy and their products act during the transition from g1- to s-phase in the cell cycle. in plants, cells in g1-phase expand and prepare for dna replication, which occurs during s-phase, just before mitosis . the transition from g1- to s-phase is well understood in plants and several cycd proteins have been identified in arabidopsis thaliana . the cycd proteins are also known to respond to various stimuli, including brassinosteroids and gibberelic acid  or sugar . in non-dormant cells, the product of the cycd gene interacts with the cyclin-dependent protein kinase  to form a complex. the formation of the cycd/cycb complex induces phosphorylation the retinoblastoma protein. this phosphorylation step triggers the release of transcription factor-like ef <dig>  which induces the expression of a battery of genes essential for dna biosynthesis, leading to transition from the s- to the g1-phase in the cell undergoing mitosis. the genes from this functional category identified in this study suggest that the genes involved in cell division are reactivated in swelling buds, to produce new cells and to prepare the bud for budburst.

response to auxin, gibberellin and brassinosteroid stimuli
this category was obtained by merging three different ontologies  . fifteen genes involved in hormone responses were identified in the go terms enrichment analysis. hormones are an essential component of dormancy regulation in perennial species. for example, anderson et al.  <cit>  reported involvement of an interaction between aba and gibberellin in the loss of apical dominance. gibberellins are also known to regulate several developmental processes, such as stem elongation, seed germination and dormancy. five genes from the response to gibberellin stimulus ontology were found, including i) a gasa4-encoding protein. gasa genes are gibberellin-responsive genes involved in several developmental processes in plants. gasa <dig> is expressed mostly in meristematic regions, consistent with a possible role in cell division  <cit> . similar results were obtained for leafy spurge, in which the gasa <dig> gene was found to be overexpressed in tissues undergoing active cellular division  <cit> , and ii) a myb <dig> gene. the precise role of this transcription factor in the regulation of dormancy regulation has not been determined, but several authors  have reported an essential role for this gene in anther development and the regulation of its expression by both auxin and gibberellin.

seven genes involved in the response to auxin stimulation were identified, including i) an obp <dig> gene highly similar to the gene encoding the dof <dig> protein. in arabidopsis thaliana, skirycz et al.  <cit>  reported the involvement of the dof <dig> protein in the control of cell division and showed that the overexpression of the gene encoding this protein led to the upregulation of many cell-cycle genes. using ssh hybridization technology, derory et al.  <cit>  also showed that some dof genes were upregulated in sessile oak during bud burst, and ii) an aux <dig> gene. in arabidopsis thaliana, aux <dig> belongs to a multigene family involved in regulating various auxin-dependent developmental processes, such as root gravitropic responses . other authors have reported upregulation of the aux <dig> gene during seed germination, in a mechanism comparable to dormancy release  <cit> . these findings suggest that plant hormones involved in swelling buds are essential for the regulation of cell division in meristematic cells.

finally, three genes were identified in the response to brassinosteroid stimulus category. again, none was specific to or preferentially expressed in the bud. these genes included: i) the bas <dig> gene encoding a member of the cytochrome p <dig> family. arabidopsis plants in which the bas <dig> gene is downregulated have a shorter hypocotyl, due to a phytochrome b defect. neff et al.  <cit>  showed that these mutants were also hypersensitive to brassinosteroids in a light-dependent manner, suggesting that the bas <dig> gene played an important role in connecting the photoreceptor and the brassinosteroid signaling pathway. photoreceptors are essential for dormancy regulation. indeed, several authors have shown that phytochrome and the constans genes are essential components of the short-day signaling pathway during growth cessation , and ii) a t5i <dig>  gene, similar to the hercule <dig> gene from arabidopsis thaliana. hercule genes encode receptor protein kinases from one of the largest known multigene families, with up to  <dig> members identified to date. hercule genes are also known to be regulated by brassinosteroids. riou-khamlichi et al.  <cit>  reported a possible role for some hercule genes in regulating a battery of genes involved in plant growth and showed that hercule genes were required for cell elongation during vegetative growth.

response to sucrose stimulation
three genes were identified in this category . sucrose appears to be a central molecular actor in the reinitiation of mitotic activity, as it is an essential component in the activities of the cell. indeed, in perennial species, sucrose is the main source of carbon. several authors have suggested that sucrose is a key factor involved in cell division and that there must be a specific mechanism for sensing cellular sugar levels in plants, to control the cell cycle  <cit> . it is well known that, during paradormancy, sugars are essential for expression of the cycd genes , which are involved in cell division . among the genes from this category identified here was a gbf <dig> gene very similar to a basic leucine zipper  <dig>  gene. hanson et al.  <cit>  reported that the translation of the basic leucine zipper  <dig> gene transcript was strongly regulated by cellular sucrose concentration. moreover, two key genes encoding enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism  have been shown to be strongly regulated by the bzip <dig> transcription factor. comparisons of ripened and dormant wheat seeds have shown an activation of nitrogen metabolism in the ripened seeds, suggesting a possible role of nitrogen metabolism in the recommencement of cell activity in pedunculate oak  <cit> . a gasa <dig> gene was also identified. gonzali et al.  reported a downregulation of the arabidopsis thaliana gasa <dig> gene after sugar application  <cit> . however, there is currently no functional annotation for the gasa <dig> gene, making it difficult to speculate on the function of the product of this gene in dormancy regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
oaks are cornerstone species with a fundamental role in temperate forest ecosystems. we therefore carried out a large-scale transcriptome analysis on two sympatric european white oaks. the resulting reference transcript catalog , established with various actively growing tissues/organs, provides the most comprehensive survey of gene expression for the quercus genus published to date. the information provided by this study already has proven useful, for the development of molecular markers for high-density linkage map construction and for studies of the degree and structure of genetic diversity in different oak species  <cit> . the regulation of some transcripts was found to be “tissue-specific”. these transcripts may therefore be considered good candidates for genes with specific functions in these tissues. in particular, the gene expression networks identified during vegetative bud release are of key importance as far as the seasonal growth of oaks is concerned, and are a valuable target for investigation in terms of the environmental changes resulting from global warming. a comparative analysis with prunus persica, a phylogenetically related species, led to the detection and location of sequences orthologous to oak transcripts on peach chromosomes, providing relevant anchor points for further comparative genomics and genetic analyses of these two genera. finally, this atlas will serve as a useful resource for annotating the reference genome sequence  <cit>  and will provide support for forward genetics and population genomics approaches aiming to identify genes of importance for forest tree adaptation.
