BACKGROUND
fas and its ligand fasl are a pair of trans-membrane proteins critically involved in apoptosis. fas is expressed in many types of tissues, whereas fasl expression is more restricted  <cit> . fasl expression is predominantly found in activated t cells. however, its expression is also reported in and outside of the immune system, such as nk cells, macrophages and sertoli cells in testis  <cit> .

in male mammalian, the sexual hormone testosterone is secreted by leydig cells in testis. we have recently demonstrated that the high levels of corticosterone  that are typically achieved during stress induce apoptotic death of leydig cells and the activation of the fas/fasl system, cleavage of procaspase- <dig>  loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased ros generation are all implicated in the process of cort-induced leydig cell death  <cit> . but the mechanism of fasl expression regulation in cort-mediated leydig cell apoptosis is unclear. transcriptional regulation of fasl expression is a complicated process, which could be involved in a variety of transcriptional factors  <cit> . it was known that fasl expression is dependent on nuclear factor of activated t-cells  in t lymphocyte. in our another study, it was found that the expression of fasl was increased in  <dig> nm cort-treated rat leydig cells and the increased expression could be alleviated by nfat inhibitor csa. meanwhile, western blot analysis of nfat protein in the cytoplasm and nuclei demonstrated that nfat was activated by cort treatment  <cit> . these results indicated that nfat is involved in cort-induced fasl expression in leydig cells, but the molecular basis for this process is not clear yet. therefore, the present study is dedicated to investigate how nfat be involved in regulation of fasl transcription.

RESULTS
analysis of nfat <dig> expression in leydig cells
to observe whether nfat is expressed in leydig cells, nfat mrna and protein expression in leydig cells was assessed using rt-pcr and western blotting respectively. as shown in fig. 1a, a band corresponding to nfat mrna was observed. fig  <dig> b shows that a  <dig> kda band corresponding to nfat was identified by anti-nfat antibody.

assay of fasl expression in mltc- <dig> cells
for assay of fasl mrna in mltc- <dig> cells, a total rna were extracted from the cells. a signigicantly increased level of fasl mrna was found in mltc- <dig> cells treated with cort . to further assay the product of fasl expression in mltc- <dig> cells subjected to  <dig> nm cort treatment, the lysates from mltc- <dig> cells were examined by western blotting. as predicted, immunoblotting with anti-fasl antibody revealed the expression of a band with a m.w about  <dig> kda . taken together, these results indicate that cort increase expression of fasl in mltc- <dig> cells. to analyze the effect of csa in cort-induced fasl expression. mltc- <dig> cells were treated with  <dig> nm cort and  <dig> ng/ml csa for  <dig> h followed by detection of fasl mrna with rt-pcr and fasl protein with immunoblotting. as shown in fig. 2a, b, the addition of csa alleviated cort-induced up-regulation of fasl expression.

rna interference-mediated silencing of nfat <dig> gene
the rt-pcr and western blotting were used to evaluate the efficiency of sirna on nfat <dig> expression. after transfection of mltc- <dig> cells with sirna targeted to nfat <dig>  expression of nfat <dig> is specifically abrogated compared with the control sirna . to determine whether nfat <dig> is responsible for fasl expression in mltc- <dig> cells, fasl expression were also detected by rt-pcr and western blotting. as shown in fig. 3c, d, fasl expression is decreased in sirna-transfected mltc- <dig> cells, whereas control sirna-transfected cells were not affected.

cort-induced nfat2-gfp nuclear translocation
to determine whether cort induces nuclear translocation of nfat <dig>  plasmids expressing a nfat2-gfp fusion protein were transfected into mltc- <dig> followed by cort or cort plus csa treatment. as shown in fig.  <dig>  nfat2-gfp was distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm in control cells. after cort treatment, nfat2-gfp translocate to the nucleus, which was blocked by nfat inhibitor csa. these results suggest that high level of cort induces nuclear translocation of nfat in mltc.

enhancement of fasl promoter activity by cort treatment
to determine whether cort regulates fasl promoter activity, fasl-p <dig> reporter construct was used to transiently transfect mltc- <dig> cells. fig. 5a shows schematically the - <dig> to + <dig> bp 5' regulatory region of fasl promoter  and the - <dig> to + <dig> bp fasl luciferase construct . as shown in fig. 5b, cort induced a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity over untreated cells. this result suggests that cort treatment enhanced fasl transcriptional activity in mltc- <dig> cells. these data show that the -618- + <dig> region is sufficient for cort-mediated activation of fasl expression.

transfection of mltc- <dig> cells with deletion constructs of fasl promoter
to localize the promoter regions responsive to cort-induced fasl expression and define the minimal functional region, a detailed 5' deletion analysis of - <dig> to + <dig> bp region was undertaken with fasl-p <dig>  fasl-p <dig>  fasl-p <dig>  fasl-p <dig>  fasl-p <dig>  fasl-p <dig>  these constructs were transiently transfected into mltc- <dig> cells followed by  <dig> nm cort treatment. as shown in fig.  <dig>  a significantly increased luciferase activity was presence in fasl-p <dig>  fasl-p <dig> and fasl-p <dig>  fasl-p <dig> showed the maximal promoter activity and minimal 5' regulation region among these constructs. these data suggest that the  <dig> bp sequence might be the regulatory elements that respond to cort-induced signaling and served as a basis for mutational analysis.

transfection of mltc- <dig> cells with mutant fasl promoter constructs at  <dig> bp sequence
activation of fasl promoter activity with transfection of nfat expression construct
to further establish that whether the nfat directly activates fasl promoter, cotransfection with the nfat expression vector pcdna <dig> -nfat and fasl-p <dig> were conducted in mltc- <dig> cells. pcdna <dig> -nfat is under the control of pcdna <dig> . pcdna <dig> -nfat with fasl-p <dig> induced potent promoter activity. however, co-transfection of pcdna <dig> -nfat with fasl-p272m induced little promoter activity . the data indicate that nfat is capable of binding to the ggaaa site of the fasl-p <dig> promoter construct.

specific binding of nfat <dig> to the fasl promoter in vivo
chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay was employed to assess the specific binding of nfat to the target site in promoter region of the fasl gene in vivo . a five-fold enrichment for fasl promoter dna over dna immunoprecipitated with a nonspecific immunoglobulin g  control antibody was demonstrated. this result indicates that nfat bind directly to the fasl promoter region.

detection of cort-induced apoptosis of mltc- <dig> cells
to verify whether  <dig> nm cort which induces up-regulation of fasl in mltc- <dig> could induce apoptosis, pi and annexin v-labeled facs assay were performed . cort treatment resulted in a significant increase of apoptotic frequency of mltc- <dig> cells, and csa, the specific inhibitor of nfat, alleviated the increase of apoptosis.

discussion
the receptor-ligand pair of fas and fasl mediates apoptosis in a wide variety of different cell populations. the importance of these interactions has been convincingly demonstrated in murine and humans possessing loss of function mutations in either molecule  <cit> . the biological importance of fasl has been highlighted recently by work demonstrating its critical role in both activation-induced cell death in t cells and in the maintenance of immune privilege within certain tissues  <cit> . however, relatively little is known about factors that regulate inducible expression of fasl outside of the immune system. our previous studies established a critical role for fasl in leydig cell via its action in cort-induced apoptosis. we are the first to demonstrate that involvement of nfat on regulation of fasl expression in cort-induced leydig cell apoptosis  <cit> . but the molecular mechanisms of nfat-mediated up-regulation of fasl expression in cort-induced leydig cell apoptosis are unknown. regulation of fasl expression is a complicated process, which could be involved in a variety of trascriptional factors including nfat, sp <dig>  early growth response gene  and so on. the nfat family of transcription factors is composed of four family members nfat <dig>  nfat <dig>  nfat <dig> and nfat <dig>  and is best known for its role in the regulation of the t cell immune response  <cit> . the principal function of nfat in t cells is to couple stimulation of the t cell antigen receptor to changes in the expression of a number of cytokine and other immunologically important genes. nfat are regulated primarily at the level of their subcellular localization through the actions of serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin . in resting cells, nfat family members are normally located in the cytoplasm in a hyperphosphorylated latent form. however, following activated can directly dephosphorylates nfat proteins, nuclear import and increased intrinsic dna binding activity occur, which could be specially inhibited by csa. once located in the nucleus, nfat are then free to bind to their target promoter elements and activate the transcription of specific nfat target genes, either alone or in combination with other nuclear partners.

this aspect of nfat regulation is likely to be significant, since both the extent and duration of nfat activity have recently been shown to influence the qualitative pattern of nfat-dependent gene expression induced during t cell activation  <cit> . the nfat signaling pathway is certainly best known for its role in the regulation of the immune response. the nfat is expressed in many cell types and contributes to diverse cellular functions  <cit> . therefore, it has become increasingly apparent that this pathway also plays an important role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular responses in a number of other tissues.

our recent study had verified that nfat was involved in cort-induced expression of fasl in rat leydig cells  <cit> . owing to relatively little is known about nfat regulation of fasl expression outside of the immune system, no doubt, it is very interesting to observe whether nfat regulate fasl expression through affection fasl promotor activation in cort-treated leydig cells.

in the present study, mltc- <dig> were selected as cell model due to its suitability for transfection. although it is widely accepted that mltc- <dig> is a favorable model for study on biology of leydig cells, we validated firstly that cort-induced up-regulation of fasl expression is also present in mltc- <dig> by rt-pcr and western blotting analysis. western blotting analysis showed nfat <dig> is the predominant isoform in mltc. however, other members of nfat family, i. e. nfat <dig>  nfat <dig> and nfat <dig> exprssion is very low compared to nfat <dig> in mltc- <dig> . it was also shown that nfat2-gfp chimeric protein translocated from cytoplasm to nuclus after cort treatment and sirna-mediated silencing of nfat decreased the extent of cort-induced fasl expression. these results were in accord with our finding in rat leydig cells, i.e. high level cort activates fas/fasl signal pathway through activation of nfat.

previous studies from other investigators suggested the presence of multiple elements at - <dig> bp at 5' untranslated region of fasl promoter, which is capable of enhancing transcriptional activity of the fasl promoter in t cells  <cit> . furthermore, we predicated the transcription start site and transcription factor binding sites on fasl promoter by analyzing the sequence of fasl 5' untranslated region through online-based computer program. based on these messages, the - <dig> bp at 5' untranslated region of fasl promoter was selected as an object to observe nfat regulation of fasl promoter activity in present study. in order to elucidate the mechanism of cort-triggered up-regulation of fasl expression in cort-treated leydig cells, we cloned - <dig> bp  at 5' untranslated region of fasl promoter and found that the -618- + <dig> region is available and sufficient for further establishment of mechanisms of nfat-triggered fasl expression in cort-treated leydig cells.

the data presented in this paper firstly suggested that activity of fasl promoter  was enhanced in cort-treated mltc. to establish the minimal function region on fasl promoter which is interaction with nfat, we synthesized a series of 5' deletion constructs and tested their transcriptional activities in response to cort treatment. it was firstly found the presence of a high active site situated between -201- + <dig> . our present data showed that there are two nfat binding sites between -201-+ <dig> region  and only one nfat binding site between -167-+ <dig> region . the  <dig> bp showed the maximal activation in whole fasl promotor sequences. latinis et al. reported that the binding of nfat to the ggaaa site on fasl active core sequence is critical for triggering fasl promoter activity  <cit> . so this specific short sequence was selected as mutated site in present experiment. it was found that the mutated sequence significantly resulted in an inhibition of fasl promoter activity following the nucleotides sequence was mutated. finally, co-transfection experiments with the nfat expression vector and fasl promoter with report gene further showed that nfat enhanced transcriptional activity of fasl promoter by interaction with its - <dig> bp dna sequence, thereby regulating fasl promoter activity in cort-treated leydig cells. in addition, mutation at - <dig> bp dna sequence also resulted in an inhibition of transcriptional activity of fasl promoter in co-transfection experiments. furthermore, the chip result further confirms that nfat directly bind to fasl promoter sequence in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
our present findings provide further insight into the mechanisms involved on the regulation of the fasl expression in response to cort treatment in leydig cells. in summary, the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of fasl expression in cort-treated mltc- <dig> is an activation on transcription factor nfat. the active transcription factor interact with specific nfat target genes in fasl promoter sequence at - <dig> to + <dig> region, thereby regulating fasl expression.
