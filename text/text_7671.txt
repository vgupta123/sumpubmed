BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori is a spiral, microaerophilic, noninvasive, gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract, primarily the stomach  <cit> . this organism has been identified as an aetiological agent of chronic active gastritis, peptic ulcer disease  <cit> , gastric adenocarcinoma  <cit> , and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue  lymphoma  <cit> . a number of factors such as the vaca cytotoxin, the cag pathogenicity island , motility, and the urease enzyme are known to be involved in the virulence of this organism  <cit> .

biofilm development is initiated when bacteria transit from a planktonic state to a lifestyle in which the microorganisms are firmly attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces, and biofilms are strongly implicated in bacterial virulence  <cit> . biofilm formation is critical not only for environmental survival but also for successful infection by numerous pathogenic bacteria. among human bacterial pathogens, the biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, pathogenic escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, staphylococci and streptococci are some of the best studied  <cit> . bacterial biofilms are frequently embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix  <cit> . the extracellular polymeric substance  matrix, which can constitute up to 90% of the biofilm biomass, is a complex mixture of exopolysaccharides, proteins, dna and other macromolecules  <cit> .

previous studies have alluded to the ability of h. pylori to form biofilms  <cit> . a polysaccharide-containing biofilm has been observed at the air-liquid interface when h. pylori was grown in a glass fermenter  <cit> . h. pylori is also capable of binding to a heterotrophic mixed species biofilm grown on stainless steel coupons  <cit> . recent studies indicated that  <dig> strains including some animal-adapted strains, clinical isolates and laboratory strains, were able to form similar three-dimensional architectures implicated in biofilm development  <cit> . cellini et al. reported that an environmental h. pylori strain, named mdc <dig>  displayed a well structured biofilm  <cit> . cole et al. also indicated that mucin greatly accelerated planktonic growth relative to the expansion of h. pylori biofilms  <cit> . in addition, a recent study indicated that h. pylori can exist in human gastric mucosa forming biofilms  <cit> . these studies indicated that the topic of biofilm formation in this organism has the potential to contribute to our knowledge of h. pylori pathogenesis. however, little is known regarding the mechanism of h. pylori biofilm development. in the present study, we characterized the ability of  <dig> reference strains and  <dig> clinical isolates of h. pylori to form biofilms. furthermore, we investigated the potential role of outer membrane vesicles  released from this organism in biofilm development.

RESULTS
biofilm formation by h. pylori strains
we attempted to grow biofilms of the  <dig> strains of h. pylori on glass coverslip surfaces in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs with shaking for  <dig> days or  <dig> days and found that all strains formed biofilms at the liquid-gas interface of the cultures. under these conditions, all of the strains except strain tk <dig> formed relatively little biofilm biomass . in contrast, the clinically isolated strain tk <dig> showed significantly higher levels of biofilm formation . the growth yields of these strains for 3- or 5-days of culturing were comparable for all of the strains . to determine the kinetics of h. pylori biofilm formation, strains tk <dig> and ss <dig> were assessed for biofilm forming ability and growth rates from day  <dig> to day  <dig> . both strains showed similar growth kinetics with both strains fully grown within  <dig> days although the maximum titers of strain ss <dig> were slightly lower compared to that of strain tk <dig>  after  <dig> days of incubation, the growth yields were slightly decreased and plateaued at day  <dig>  on the other hand, biofilm formation by strain tk <dig> increased until day  <dig> . after  <dig> days of incubation, biofilm formation reached a plateau up to day  <dig>  biofilm formation by strain ss <dig> was not significantly different from day  <dig> to day  <dig> , and biofilm formation was significantly lower than that of tk <dig> upon cultivation for up to  <dig> days.

morphological analysis of biofilms
the biofilms were stained with a baclight live/dead bacterial viability kit solution which could differentiate between live cells  and dead cells . strain tk <dig> formed strong biofilms covering the entire visible area  but the other strain ss <dig> formed relatively poor biofilms . in the biofilms of both strains, the majority of the biofilm cells were stained green . in order to confirm that the tk <dig> biofilm cells were viable, the 2-day and 3-day biofilms cells were scrapped into pbs and the optical densities and the cfu values of the mixtures were evaluated . the 2-day and 3-day cultures of this strain in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs were also measured as controls. the optical densities and cfu of the 3-day biofilm cells showed increases compared to those of 2-day biofilm cells. further, the cfu values were normalized to optical densities. the values for the 2-day biofilm cells were similar compared to the controls . however, the normalized values for 3-day biofilm cells tended to be decreased, although there was no significant difference in the normalized values, suggesting that 3-day biofilm cells might contain some dead cells or morphologically altered cells.

a) the biofilm cells were scrapped by mechanical treatment into pbs. the cell suspensions were examined by optical densities and cfu were also calculated.

b) the standard broth cultures of strain tk <dig> in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs were examined by optical densities and cfu.

data are shown as the mean value of the 3-independent experiments ± standard deviations.

next we analyzed the biofilm thickness of strains tk <dig>  ss <dig>  tk <dig>  and atcc  <dig> with cmls observations. strain tk <dig> exhibited 2-fold or greater biofilm thickness compared to the other strains . to clarify the architectural characteristics of h. pylori biofilms, we compared tk <dig> and ss <dig> biofilms by sem analysis. in the biofilms of strain ss <dig>  the bacteria attached to glass surfaces in thin layers . interestingly, the biofilms consisted mainly of bleb-like or amorphous structures. on the other hand, the tk <dig> biofilms were composed primarily of cells with bacillary morphology which were clearly outlined . in addition, these later bacteria showed layer formation with bacterial aggregates in the biofilms. the biofilm bacterial aggregates appeared to result from direct cell-cell attachment. intriguingly, tk <dig> biofilms showed the presence of many omv-like structures on the glass surface as well as on the bacterial cell surfaces . these structures were not detected in the biofilms of the other strains . a recent report indicated that omv production from h. pylori clinical isolate mdc <dig> was apparent under sem observation  <cit> . we thus decided to focus our attention more on the omv-like structures in subsequent experiments.

potential role of the omv in tk <dig> biofilm formation
we observed more closely the omv-like structures in the thin-sectioned biofilms using tem . these structures consisted primarily of bilayered proteolipids which were mainly spherical in shape . these structures also exhibited the characteristics typical of gram negative bacterial omv  <cit> . we confirmed that the omv-fraction did not contain flagella by observation with sm and western blotting with anti-flagella antibody.

we next found that the fcs concentration in the biofilm growing medium affected biofilm formation of h. pylori tk <dig> . the lower concentrations of fcs  caused a significant decrease in biofilm formation in this strain compared to that in 7% fcs. therefore, the intensity of biofilm formation was dependent upon the concentration of fcs. the omv were isolated from the cells under these conditions and characterized by sds-page . as the components of fcs might be present in the omv fraction, the control fractions from brucella broth supplemented with various concentration of fcs  without the microorganism were used as controls. there were many protein bands which did not conform to fcs components . to quantify the production of omv under these conditions, the omv-fractions were analyzed by western blotting with anti-h. pylori strain nctc  <dig> antibody. there were many positive bands and the intensity of these bands correlated with the fcs concentrations . as a negative control, control fractions from brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs without the microorganism were used and there were no detectable corresponding bands . in addition, we observed the biofilms under these conditions with sem . there were no omv in the biofilms of brucella medium only . in contrast, a large number of the omv were detected in biofilms in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs . under these conditions, the quantity of the omv in the biofilm appeared to be dependent upon the concentration of fcs . these results suggested that the production of omv might be related to the biofilm forming ability of strain tk <dig> 

we further determined that 3-day biofilm formation with strain tk <dig> in brucella broth supplemented with 7% hs or  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin was significantly weaker than that in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs . other strains, which form thin biofilms in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs, also formed weaker biofilms, similar to or weaker than those in fcs broth with either horse serum or β-cyclodextrin. the final densities of strain tk <dig> evaluated by od <dig> units after  <dig> days of culture were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  following growth with brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs, 7% hs, or  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin, respectively. we then isolated the omv from tk <dig> cultured in brucella broth containing 7% fcs, 7% hs, or  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin and western blotting with the anti-h. pylori antibody was carried out . the 50- to 60-kda omv protein band intensities from growth in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs were much greater than comparable fractions from 7% hs or  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin-grown cultures. these results suggested that lower production of omv might lead to weaker biofilm formation in brucella broth supplemented with 7% hs or  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin.

to directly verify that the omv were components of the tk <dig> biofilm matrix and that the production of the omv can induce strong biofilm formation, tk <dig> biofilm formation with  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin medium was analyzed following the addition of the omv fraction from tk <dig> cultures in brucella broth containing 7% fcs. the protein concentration of the omv-fraction was adjusted to  <dig>  mg/ml or  <dig>  mg/ml. the omv fraction  was added to brucella broth with  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin and biofilm formation with strain tk <dig> was carried out. as the components of fcs might be present in the omv fraction and could affect biofilm formation, a control fraction from brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs without the microorganism was used. the levels of biofilm formation in the  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin medium supplemented with the control omv fraction was similar to that of the  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin medium alone . on the other hand, the addition of the  <dig>  mg omv fraction from tk <dig> showed significantly higher levels of biofilm formation than those in  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin medium with the control fraction . the levels of biofilm formation with omv addition were similar to that in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs . we further determined that the  <dig>  mg omv fraction from h. pylori cultured in brucella broth containing  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin could also enhance biofilm formation but at levels lower than  <dig>  mg of this fraction. the omv fraction induced more biofilm formation than  <dig>  mg of the omv fraction from 7% fcs medium .

evaluation of biofilm formation by other isolated h. pylori strains
in order to detect other strains having similar biofilm forming ability to strain tk <dig>  we assessed the biofilm forming ability of ten additional clinical isolates of h. pylori. only strain tk <dig> showed similar levels of biofilm formation to that of strain tk <dig> . the other strains showed lower levels of biofilm formation than strain tk <dig> . the structure of tk <dig> biofilms was then observed by using sem . cellular aggregation was observed to be similar to that of tk <dig> biofilms and many vesicle-like structures were also detected with tk <dig>  moreover, 3-day biofilm formation with strain tk <dig> in brucella broth supplemented with  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin was weaker than that in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs. however, the addition of the omv fraction from tk <dig> in brucella broth supplemented with  <dig> % β-cyclodextrin restored biofilm formation similar to that in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs .

discussion
in this study, we characterized biofilm formation in h. pylori strains and demonstrated differential abilities to form biofilms in reference and clinical isolates. in addition, the production of omv in strain tk <dig> was correlated with strong biofilm formation. several reports indicated that h. pylori has the ability to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces in vitro as well as on human gastric mucosa  <cit> . the results of the biofilm formation analyses demonstrated that strain tk <dig> has strong biofilm forming ability compared to other strains independent of its growth rate. development of strain tk <dig> and ss <dig> biofilms from day  <dig> to day  <dig> demonstrated that it took  <dig> days for biofilm maturation under these conditions, suggesting that h. pylori biofilm formation might proceed in an organized fashion through early , intermediate  and maturation  phases of development. similar distinct developmental phases have been reported for biofilm formation by other bacterial species  <cit> . since development of biofilms is closely associated with the generation of a matrix, the majority of which is extracellular material, biofilm development in h. pylori appears to share common basic steps with other biofilm forming bacteria.

the biofilm forming cells at day  <dig> generally appeared to be viable when the cells were exposed to live/dead baclight staining. in addition, the normalized cfu values for the biofilm and broth culture cells following  <dig> days of incubation were comparable. in 3-day biofilm cells, this value was slightly decreased compared to 3-day broth culture cells, suggesting the presence of some dead cells in the biofilm. these results are consistent with the maturation phase of the development of biofilms in 3-day biofilms of strain tk <dig>  since biofilms are thought to be encased in an eps matrix as well as dead cells  <cit> . in addition, strain tk <dig> exhibited thick biofilm formation. the biofilm morphology of strain tk <dig> showed direct cell-cell bound aggregates as well as flagella-dependent binding forms. the cell-cell interacting forms might act as precursors for thick biofilm formation. gots et al. indicated that cell-cell aggregation induces a multilayered architecture during staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation  <cit> . moreover, in our sem observations, for the majority of the h. pylori strains examined, ie., ss <dig>  biofilms may contain autolysed cells. on the other hand, there were clearly intact cells in tk <dig>  as well as tk <dig>  biofilms and the later is also another strong biofilm forming strain. these observations suggested that these strong biofilm forming strains may remain in an active metabolic state for a relatively long time without exhibiting morphological changes or autolysis, in comparison with the other strains. these later properties could be responsible for the weaker biofilm forming activities of most of the strains examined in this study.

in the sem observations of tk <dig> biofilms, there were many omv. omv production is a physiologically normal function of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . it was also reported that the h. pylori strains released omv into the extracellular space  <cit> . a recent report indicated that omv were a component of the matrix of p. aeruginosa biofilms  <cit> . we analyzed thin-sections of strain tk <dig> biofilms with tem. the omv were located at the substratum-bacterium interface and extracellular space. interestingly, some of omv appeared to be involved in attaching one cell with another. this observation suggested that the omv produced by strain tk <dig> could be intimately involved in biofilm formation.

previously, several reports indicated that vaca, urease and lipopolysaccharides are present on the surface of omv from h. pylori along with other outer membrane proteins  <cit> . we quantified omv production in brucella broth supplemented with various concentration of fcs using western blotting with anti-h. pylori antibody. moreover, the sem observations were also carried out to directly confirm this. the fcs concentration in the biofilm medium showed a direct positive correlation with omv production as well as biofilm forming ability. further, similar results were detected by the addition of serum from different hosts as well as with synthetic substrates. on the other hand, observation with biofilm forming bacteria indicated that lps plays a role in biofilm development and architecture  <cit> . recently, keenan et al. reported that lps detected in omv under iron-limited conditions were notably shorter than those under iron-replete conditions  <cit> . we hypothesize that strain tk <dig> has an altered lps, particularly lps o-antigens under different experimental conditions including the use of different animal sera, synthetic substrates, or different fcs concentrations. to confirm this, we analyzed the lps profiles of h. pylori cultured in different culture media by sds-page and silver staining. however, there were no differences in the lps o-antigen profiles. we then isolated the omv from the tk <dig> culture supernatant in order to examine the role of these structures in biofilm formation. biofilm formation by this strain was increased following the addition of the omv-fraction in a dose-dependent manner. although the quantities of omv added were three- to five-fold more than the quantity of the omv which exist in biofilms under our experimental conditions, the omv appear to play an important role in the formation of the extracellular matrix of strain tk <dig> biofilms. the extracellular matrix serves a role in bacterial attachment to abiotic and cellular surfaces in the initial stage of biofilm formation  <cit> . it is possible that specific proteins in the omv released from strain tk <dig> may take part in bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation. which component of the omv contribute to biofilm formation still remains to be determined. additional investigations are now in progress to determine such components in the omv.

in the present study, we searched for other clinical isolates with strong biofilm formation and one strain, tk <dig>  exhibited similar ability to form biofilms as strain tk <dig>  this suggested that h. pylori strains exhibiting strong biofilm forming ability are relatively rare. indeed, williams et al. indicated that fcs inhibited adherence to abiotic surfaces in some of the h. pylori strains  <cit> . this apparent discrepancy between their study and our present results in terms of the effects of fcs might be due to differences in the h. pylori strains used.

strain tk <dig> was isolated from a patient with duodenal and gastric ulcers in japan. this strain contains the caga, cagpai and vaca genes as demonstrated by pcr  <cit> . it was also shown that this strain expresses the lewisy antigen  on the cell surface. moreover, strain tk <dig> was reported to exhibit virulence in gnotobiotic mice  <cit> , c57bl mice  <cit> , and mongolian gerbils  <cit> . these reports indicated that the tk <dig> strain has the ability to colonize the stomach of these animals as well as in humans. these results as well as our present findings suggest that this colonization ability might be correlated with the strong biofilm forming ability of strain tk <dig>  therefore, we speculate that strong biofilm forming ability is related to gastric colonization by h. pylori in various animals as well as in humans. it is recognized that an understanding of h. pylori biofilm formation is still in its infancy. the ability of h. pylori strains, as exemplified by strain tk <dig>  to form biofilms may play a part of role in the infectious process.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that strain tk <dig> has strong biofilm forming ability. in addition, the results suggested that this property is dependent upon direct cell-cell binding mediated by the omv of this strain. this represents a new observation relative to a potentially novel gastric cell colonization factor of this organism.
