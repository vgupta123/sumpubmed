BACKGROUND
recent progress in genome projects has generated a vast amount of nucleotide sequence data, and analyses of gene expression by global approaches have started to broaden our understanding of cell systems. as a useful model for systems biology and genomics, many studies use bacillus subtilis, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium whose genome sequence has been determined  <cit> . the ultimate goal of post-genome analysis is to specify transcriptional regulation in the entire genome. computational algorithms to locate transcription units  have been developed based on analysis of signal sequences that are located at the boundaries of tus from promoters to terminators, homologous gene pairs on other genomes, intergenic distance, functional categories, and gene clusters conserved among various species  <cit> . in the present study, a string of one or more genes co-transcribed is defined as a tu  <cit> .

identification of transcription factors  and their binding sites on their target genes is an important element of transcriptome analysis in the post-genome-sequencing era. until now, various approaches have been taken to identify specific dna-binding sites of tfs. dna-binding specificities have traditionally been determined by experimental techniques such as dnase i footprinting and electromobility shift assay  <cit> . more recently, putative tf binding sites have been identified by computational techniques such as hidden markov models   <cit>  and position-weight matrices   <cit> . the pwm has one column for each position in the binding site and one row for each nucleotide. each of the matrix elements is proportional to the relative frequency of the corresponding nucleotide at each position, and the score for a particular site is the sum of the matrix values for the sequence. therefore, pwm is often used to predict nucleotide-protein binding sites and is used in the transfac database, which covers many known tfs and binding sites  <cit> . this approach is a convenient way to identify positions that are more highly conserved than others in a whole genome, because any sequence that differs from a consensus sequence has a lower score. the accuracy of detecting promoter sequences thus depends on the conservation of tf-binding sites.

we can now use complete genomic dna sequences from several species and analyze massive amount of data on differential gene expression in microarray experiments  <cit> . using microarrays in various conditions, we can obtain co-expression patterns for adjacent genes, which is an important property for determining transcription units.

in the present study, we identify the tus in b. subtilis using a combination of  a bioinformatics approach, using pwm methods that identify tf-binding sites by detecting statistically significant tf-binding sequences on the genome; and  two dna microarray analyses, one to predict co-expressed gene clusters by calculating pearson correlation coefficients of expression profiles for neighboring genes, and the other to determine genes regulated by each of the tfs in the units by comparing gene expression between wild-type and tf deletion mutants in the genome.

RESULTS
the integrated strategy for tu prediction
the procedures for elucidating tus are outlined in fig.  <dig>  first, co-expressed gene clusters were determined by correlating expression profiles between neighboring genes transcribed in the same direction with no intervening gene transcribed in the opposite direction ). co-expression between neighboring genes was estimated using a t-test of the pearson correlation coefficient. to predict co-expressed gene clusters on the b. subtilis genome, we used  <dig> dna microarray data sets in  <dig> different time-series growth conditions. we then detected various sizes of co-expressed gene clusters and observed that most clusters consisted of four genes or less.

second, we regarded genes having promoters predicted by pwm as the start of the tus ). there are at least  <dig> different σ factors that direct rna polymerase, and a large number of sequence-specific dna binding proteins that play various roles of controlling gene expression, as promoter activators or repressors in b. subtilis  <cit> . we then examined the tf-binding promoter sequences of  <dig> σ factors except σa, which are known to possess multiple cis elements, and  <dig> tfs within  <dig> bp upstream of an open reading frame for all  <dig>  genes of b. subtilis by pwm, and found putative promoters regulated by each tf below the thresholds. figure 2a shows a comparison of coverage  and sensitivity  between the 1% and 5% thresholds. we were able to narrow down the candidates for tf-binding sites to  <dig> % of the candidates  when we changed the threshold from 5% to 1% . on the 5% threshold, we identified an average of 78% known promoters, and an average of 69% promoters on the threshold of 1% . thus, the average difference of detecting known promoters is 9%, corresponding to  <dig>  promoters, by changing the threshold from 5% to 1%. furthermore, in most tfs we could efficiently narrow down candidates for the tf binding site, and found that the number of known promoter sites detected below each of the thresholds hardly changed. therefore, we took these pwm analyses at the threshold of 1%.

third, we derived significant expression change data from tf deletion mutant microarray data to identify genes regulated by each of the tfs ). in these analyses, we applied a one-sided test to examine genes whose expression changed significantly in the normalized microarray data, and found candidate up-regulated genes for  <dig> tfs, including  <dig> σ factors and candidate down-regulated genes for  <dig> tfs. furthermore, we used the false discovery rate  procedure to remove false-positive data from the candidates of significant expression change data and narrow the candidates for genes regulated by each of the tfs  <cit> .

we then integrated these analyses, and present a comparison of coverage  and sensitivity  between two integrated conditions . we were able to narrow down the candidate genes composing tus at the 5% pwm without fdr to  <dig> % of the candidates  when we changed the condition from the pwm 5% threshold without fdr to the pwm 1% threshold with fdr, with  <dig> % of genes detected at 5% pwm without fdr also being detected at 1% pwm with fdr. thus, the candidates can be effectively narrowed without remarkable loss of regulation-known genes under the condition of 1% pwm with fdr. the σl, perr, and purr tus were efficiently detected. regarding the σl tus in particular, we could narrow down the  <dig> tu candidates for the pwm 5% threshold to  <dig> candidates for the pwm 1% threshold with fdr control without any loss of sensitivity. the detected tus for the 1% pwm with fdr and known tus regulated by each of the tfs are listed in additional file  <dig> 

organization of tus in b. subtilis
the difference between tus predicted in the present study and known operons in b. subtilis indicates that most of the predicted tus are consistent with those reported . consequently, the entire tu map on b. subtilis genome can be estimated on the basis of the predicted tus. at the 1% pwm with fdr, we can pick  <dig>  genes composing  <dig> tus, which include known operons, from the complete b. subtilis genome. the average size of the polycistronic transcription unit is  <dig>  genes, which is comparable in size to those in staphylococcus aureus   <cit>  and in e. coli k <dig>   <cit> . distribution of the tus to the number of genes is almost identical between b. subtilis and s. aureus   <cit> . thus the operon organization of those two gram-positive bacteria are fundamentally identical and are approximated by power-law equations, where the correlation of the double logarithm linear relation between the numbers of genes and of tus composed by the genes is - <dig>  in s. aureus and - <dig>  in b. subtilis.

discussion
in the present study, we identified various sizes of tus regulated by each tf and detected gene clusters consisting of part of well-known operons . they are known to be regulated by internal promoters and to constitute functional components  <cit> , for instance, yabpq regulated by σe that plays an important role in synthesis of the spore cortex and coat  <cit> , and divic-yabr regulated by σx which is essential for the initiation of vegetative septum formation  <cit>  in yabmnopq-divic-yabr operon. therefore, these gene clusters separated by internal promoters tend to be functional units.

using the tu data, we examined the transcriptional regulation of genes by  <dig> σ factors whose promoter sequences have been characterized. the properties of individual σ factors are as follows: five σ factors  regulate sporulation through morphological stages that involve the conversion of the growing cell to a two-cell sporangium, which ultimately proceeds to a single spore; σb mediates the general stress response, and more than  <dig> protein-coding genes for general stress belong to the σb regulon  <cit> ; σl mediates cold-shock adaptation and regulation of the acetoin catabolic pathway  <cit> ; σd regulates flagellar synthesis, motility, and chemotaxis  <cit> ; σm mediates salt resistance  <cit> ; and σx and σw play modulatory roles in extracytoplasmic function  <cit> . all the regulative relations of the  <dig> σ factors and  <dig> tfs to targeted genes are listed in table s <dig>  making it possible to characterize individual σ factors according to the genes they target. therefore, we classified genes belonging to each of the tus into  <dig> cog  functional categories  <cit>  for estimating the general roles of the σ factors and tfs in cellular processes .

the similarity of the roles in cellular process between individual tfs was estimated using pearson correlation coefficients for the number of genes belonging to each of the cog categories . the five σ factors associated with regulation of the sporulation process can be classified into three groups corresponding to the sporulation process stage 0-iii  characterized by category , stage iv  characterized by the category , and stage v  characterized by category . gene expression under the σg control occurs in the prespore, and the main functions are to protect the spore from several hazardous conditions, high osmotic pressure  <cit> , uv radiation and dry heat  <cit> , and to prepare the spore for germination and outgrowth  <cit> . in this process, σg regulates carbohydrate content in the cell, for example, by activating expression of the glucose dehydrogenase operon  <cit> , controlling metabolism of the tricarboxylic acid cycle  <cit>  and glucose uptake  <cit> . σk is synthesized and becomes active in the mother cell, and directs formation of the spore coat and spore maturation  <cit> . therefore, these previous experimental studies are consistent with the present results. moreover, we can observe that each tf in a cluster has one of the frequently detected functional categories . the arar protein is well known as a negative regulator of the l-arabinose metabolic operon  <cit> , and most of the genes negatively regulated by arar belong to  . almost all the genes up-regulated by sinr are in category , which consists of proteins controlling cell motility and secretion, while the down-regulated genes belong to category , which consists of proteins operating cell-wall and membrane biogenesis . comk synthesis is regulated by a series of reactions that involve quorum sensing; sinr is one of the activators in this cascade, acting negatively on rok transcription  <cit> , and is known to be a potent repressor of biofilm formation  <cit> . thus, the analysis presented here agrees well with previous experimental data and enables us to assess the roles of the σ factors and tfs in cellular processes.

in addition, the genes targeted by σ factors and tfs are classified into  <dig> categories based on functional classification of the b. subtilis protein-encoding genes  <cit>  to examine the role similarities among them based on b. subtilis-specific gene functions such as the endospore-formation process. we then show the projection of σ factors and tfs in the largest two principal components  and factor loadings of individual categories, indicating the contribution of the category frequencies to the two principal components based on the frequencies of the  <dig> categories . we observe a small cluster composed of σd, ctsr and sinr , which is consistent with the result in fig.  <dig>  here, σd is the σ 28-form subunit of rna polymerase, and many σd-dependent genes are known to be necessary for flagellar synthesis and motility functions  <cit> . in addition, ctsr controls the expression of heat-shock proteins that are required for stress tolerance and growth at high temperature  <cit> , and play essential roles in competence development and motility  <cit> ; sinr also regulates the development of genetic competence and motility  <cit> . thus, the roles of these three tfs in cellular processes are associated with motility, and those are plotted in the same region of the cluster characterized by category  . this result shows that roles of tfs can be estimated by the principal component analysis  based on comprehensive searches for functions of gene composing these tus.

it can also be seen in another cluster composed of fur, zur, iolr, purr, rocr, and glnr . fur and zur regulate the expression of abc transporters and both tfs control iron and zinc uptake and homeostasis pathways in response to available metals  <cit> . iolr and purr also control transport systems. iolr regulates genes encoding inositol transporters and inositol uptake  <cit> , while purr regulates purine transport, metabolism, and biosynthetic pathways  <cit> . in this cluster, rocr and glnr relate to controlling nitrogen sources: rocr controls arginine catabolism  <cit>  and the arginase pathway in which arginine is converted to glutamate  <cit> , while glnr regulates responses to nitrogen availability, such as nitrogen metabolism  <cit>  and assimilation  <cit> .

based on these previous studies, this result shows that we can cluster together homeostatic regulation tfs . moreover, σ factors that regulate sporulation  tend to exist near the y-axis in the region of lower first-principal component  values with negative pc <dig> values, and trer, sinr, and ccpc are also plotted near the σ factors . trer regulates trehalose as the sole carbon and energy source of b. subtilis during spore outgrowth  <cit> , while sinr controls regulatory genes involved in the early stages of sporulation  <cit> . thus, sporulation-related tfs tend to have lower pc <dig> values and negative pc <dig> values, which may be evidence that category  and  are plotted in the area . therefore, ccpc is known to be a regulator of the tricarboxylic acid cycle genes  <cit> , but may also have a function in regulating sporulation genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presented the new approach to tu prediction in the bacterial whole genome using integrated analysis of microarray and dna sequence data, and we efficiently detected genes composing tus in b. subtilis genome. the results demonstrate that the combined approach is very useful for identifying unknown tus in the genome, and also detecting internal operons in the known operons. this methodology should contribute to studies of predicting tu locations in the bacterial genome and estimating roles of tfs.
