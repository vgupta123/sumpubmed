BACKGROUND
chips exposing precisely arranged spots of peptides on top of a solid support constitute a fairly young alternative to widely implemented display  <cit>  or protein-fragment complementation  <cit>  methods - each with its unique strengths and weaknesses - for extracting functional target binders from combinatorial peptide libraries  <cit> . their popularity is at least in part attributable to the rising appreciation of peptides as starting points for the design of novel therapeutics - ideally exhibiting favourable safety, tolerability plus efficacy profiles by merging advantages of traditional small molecule drugs  with those of proteins   <cit> . as highlighted elsewhere , peptide chips can in essence be assembled by  <dig> different procedures, namely parallel on-chip  synthesis, particle-based printing, or deposition of chemically pre-synthesized peptides. fodor and co-workers were amongst the first to convert merrifield solid phase peptide chemistry  <cit>  to a chip format. they introduced a set of photolabile ‘caps’ that only upon selective laser illumination allowed for the liberation of the n-terminus of a growing peptide chain, in this way making it possible to exactly guide repetitive cycles of light-directed de-protection, coupling, and washing away of unreacted monomers  <cit> . in contrast, the conceptually simpler, much more popular spot approach - launched by frank and colleagues  <cit>  in continuing the previous achievements of geysen et al.  <cit>  - delivers small volumes of pre-activated amino acid  solutions on a porous planar support . absorbed droplets create individual reaction compartments for subsequent parallel combinatorial peptide synthesis by standard fmoc  cleavage processes  <cit> . particle-mediated layer-by-layer ‘laser printing’  <cit> , next, relies on  <dig> different toner matrices that encapsulate chemically activated, on-demand addressable building blocks instead of regular colour pigments. when the latter are deposited and heated up, all the solid microparticles at once melt, triggering the release plus instantaneous coupling of the hitherto matrix-arrested aa . spotted peptide chips, lastly, make use of robotic microarrayers to  immobilize  volumes of pre-synthesized  peptide solutions onto coherent substratum  <cit> . solely this procedure offers the option to integrate quality control in the manufacturing process, and might under certain circumstances - e.g. when multiple copies of the same chip are required - be more efficient as each molecules needs to be synthesized only once.table  <dig> strengths and limitations of recombinant peptide chips

 • peptide libraries are created via recombinational cloning .
 • design ranges from entirely random peptide collections to customized content .
 • peptide lengths are not limited as is still the case for state-of-the-art chemical on-chip synthesis, particle-based printing or chemically pre-manufactured peptide spotting.
 • growth, induction and lysis of library-transformed e. coli clones all takes place on a single nitrocellulose membrane.
 • evaporation or merging of spots is not a major concern.
 • the technique is conceptually facile, robust, cost-effective, sensitive, and easily scalable; fast turnaround times.
 • has many promising applications, e.g.: epitope mapping, alanine substitutions, replacement studies, truncation scans, positional/ scrambled peptide library screening, along with unbiased examinations without any a priori knowledge.
 • limited throughput can be compensated by massive parallelization .
 • extracted hits are immediately available as clones.
 • integration of controls for quality estimation, affinity assessment, and inter-blot normalization is possible.
 • at present reachable density  represents an only sparse sampling of the theoretically possible combinatorial random  peptide library diversity.
 • number of peptides that can be screened in a single approach is several orders smaller than feasible in typical yeast two-hybrid  or phage display settings.
 • technical equipment for robotic clone picking, reagent dispensing and/or clone arraying  might be needed .
 • currently only evaluated for moderate and higher affinity  binding strengths, not for weak interactors.



features like utmost aptitude towards miniaturization, multiplexing and automation equip this technology - irrespective of the underlying production method - with far-reaching applications, tentatively only restrained by combinatorial diversity plus realizable resolution. incorporation of modified or non-proteinogenic  segments during chip compilation furthermore offers access to a much wider chemical space. in practice, however, limited synthesizable peptide lengths as well as peptide numbers per area, inconsistent purities  and prohibitively high costs still impede a widespread adoption. the relatively small liquid droplets in spot synthesis, for instance, tend to either evaporate or merge with their neighbors, thus limiting manageable densities to  <dig> to maximally  <dig> peptides per cm <dig>  lithographic policies, in comparison, support much higher crowding, yet allow for only one type of aa building block to be sequentially connected, bringing about fairly low synthesis rates  <cit> . even though first systemic ultra-dense arrangements  have only recently been pioneered  <cit> , recombinant peptide chips could definitely obliterate some of above-mentioned bottlenecks. to this end, we evaluated overall performance, practical diversity as well as throughput of recombinant peptide chips in a test screen against streptavidin, and evaluated isolated hits with biochemical and biophysical methods. from our data we conclude that this conceptually simple, innovative technique could deliver further flexibility to basic and applied research. the underlying experimental workflow is summarized in figs.  <dig> and 2d, and apparent strengths and limitations of this method are highlighted in table  <dig>  fig.  <dig> experimental workflow




methods
subcloning of test constructs
templates for strep-tag i   <cit> , strep-tag ii   <cit>  as well as a  <dig> glycine  linker spaced dimer  resembling a published twin-conformation  <cit>   were de novo assembled by eurofins mwg operon as attb site-flanked oligonucleotides, and directly recombined into gateway® entry vector pdonr™-zeo . resultant constructs were shuttled into bacterial expression vector pdest™ <dig> . inserts were sequence-verified .

acquisition of recombinant streptavidin/streptactin
recombinant streptavidin and/or streptactin proteins, in either unconjugated format  or with horseradish peroxidase  or europium labels, were purchased from thermo fisher scientific, biorad or perkin elmer, respectively.

peptide library construction
templates for linear  or cyclically constrained  hexamer or nonamer peptide libraries were ordered at microsynth ag, and equipped on both ends with full recombinase recognition sites in the course of a standard pcr reaction . resultant pcr products were directly inserted into pdonr™-zeo by bp recombination. two 10 μl reactions each containing equimolar ratios of 150 ng insert  dna, 150 ng vector and 2 μl bp clonase™ ii mix in 1× te  were incubated at room temperature  for 20 h. the mixture was then pooled, purified via illustra’s gfx™ pcr dna and gel band purification kit , transformed into  <dig> aliquots of electrocompetent top <dig> e. coli cells  and propagated on large  low salt lb agar plates supplemented with 25 μg/ml zeocin™ . serial dilutions were in parallel plated to assess the number of independent transformants containing unique inserts. the next day, clones were scraped, pooled, and plasmid dna of resultant primary entry libraries prepared using the genelute™ hp plasmid maxiprep kit . part of the e. coli libraries was 1: <dig> supplemented with 87% glycerol and frozen at −80 °c for long-term storage. for final generation of screening-ready 6/ <dig> or c-6/9-c destination collections, respective constructs were shuttled into vector pdest™ <dig> using gateway® lr clonase™ ii plus mix  according to the manufacturer’s protocols, except that again a 5× scale was used and recommended proteinase k digestion was omitted  <cit> . reactions were purified by running through illustra’s spin columns , and transformed into 100 μl electrocompetent top <dig> e. coli cells. for selection of successfully recombined vectors, cells were plated on  <dig> large lb agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. transformants of two plates each were scraped from solid-surface agar, and plasmid dna recovered. insert diversity was estimated by sequencing  <dig> randomly picked clones each with vector-specific primers .

recombinant peptide chip assembling and screening
competent e. coli one shot® bl <dig> star™  cells  carrying the gene for t <dig> rna polymerase under control of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside -inducible lacuv <dig> promotor were transformed with respective expression libraries, and plated onto large square q-trays. individual colonies were robotically picked  into suitable  <dig> well plates containing liquid lb medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and cultivated overnight at 37 °c. alternative route was to directly split appropriately diluted  transformation reactions  into  <dig> well plates via a programmable flexdrop precision reagent dispenser . the next day, clones were robotically arrayed onto a  <dig>  μm pore size protran™ nitrocellulose sheet  cut in the form of the original masterplate, applying a 1 ×  <dig>  5 ×  <dig>  5 ×  <dig>  or 10 ×  <dig> pattern . following a  <dig> to 8 h incubation interval on top of solid lb at 30 °c, peptide expression was achieved by transferring these membrane-imprinted clones onto lb agar plates supplemented with 1 mm iptg, followed by a 2 h incubation interval at 37 °c. cells were then directly lysed via transfer into a tris-buffered saline  solution containing  <dig> % tween- <dig> and 3% blotting-grade milk powder. membranes were in refined dot-blot reminiscent procedure challenged with  hrp- or europium labeled streptavidin  for 1 h at rt, washed  <dig> times in tbs- <dig> % tween, and scanned with either a chemidoc imaging system  after exposure to immobilon™ western chemiluminescent substrate , or directly with a prototypic spectramax® paradigm® multi-mode detection platform .

fluorescence polarization 
fp assays were performed in es <dig> buffer , applying 80 μl reaction volumes per black-bottomed  <dig> microtitre plate well . 20 nm  of 5’fam-labeled strep-tagi , strep-tag ii or any novel hit were incubated with rising concentrations of streptavidin/streptactin protein  for at least 2 h at rt  to ensure binding equilibrium. fluorescence emission  intensities from both parallel and perpendicular orientations were after excitation at 480 nm measured in a dtx multimode detector , checked for absence of abnormal intensity changes , and polarization values  calculated via the formula mp = 1000/, where g represents the g factor . data were analyzed by graphpad prism  <dig> software, and the dissociation constant kd calculated by non-linear regression .

bio-layer interferometry  binding kinetics
binding between streptavidin and strep-tagii, b <dig> or f <dig>  were in relation to a negative control peptide  analyzed on fortebio’s blitz® system. after recording of the primary baseline for 30 s in es <dig> buffer, hydrated streptavidin-coated biosensors were loaded with chemically synthesized peptides, and a potential increase in bli signal measured for 2 min. dissociation was assessed by transferring the loaded biosensor to a tube containing buffer only. affinities  were calculated using the embedded blitzpro  <dig>  software.

fusion of chip-derived hits b <dig> and f <dig> 
templates for 12g–spaced dimeric f <dig>   and in analogous fashion for b <dig> were ordered at microsynth ag and amplified with attb primers. after subcloning in pdonr™-zeo and further in pdest™ <dig>  any observable change in interaction strength was evaluated on recombinant peptide chip level in relation to enclosed strep-tagii and dim12g control constructs.

recombinant protein production and western blot analysis of b5/f <dig>  tagged s. aureus clfb
primers for c-terminally equipping an exemplary 38 kda s. aureus clfb fragment  with strep-tag i . for small-scale purification, clfb from soluble, iptg induced supernatants was captured on pre-equilibrated magnetic streptavidin coated dynabeads®  in pbs on a rotary shaker, washed  <dig> times in pbs containing  <dig> % bovine serum albumin, eluted by harsh boiling for 2 min in 1× sds sample buffer, and subjected to 12% sds-page electrophoresis. following transfer to nitrocellulose and blocking in 3% non-fat milk in tbs- <dig> % tween for 1 h at rt, membranes were probed either directly with hrp-streptavidin / streptactin  or with an α-6xhis his  / hrp-α-mouse antibody  combination. for dot blot analysis, 1 μl of total cell lysates, soluble supernatants, and recovered eluates were manually spotted each.

RESULTS
both novel and cognate streptavidin binders can be extracted from recombinant peptide chips
screening parameters were first of all optimized: signal-to-background ratios and realizable detection limits were assessed by analyzing the associations between published strep-tagi and ii peptides  and either commercially available hrp- or fluorescence labeled streptavidin. our preliminary screening of a recombinant test peptide chip content assembled from respective control strains  permitted us to clearly distinguish both moderate  and higher affinity  binders in comparison to the enclosed negative control, pointing to the overall practical feasibility of such an approach. we next further optimized e. coli growth times , induction intervals, critical cell densities required, printing conditions, lysis and detection conditions, etc. . incubation of the imprinted membranes for  <dig> to 8 h at 30 °c on top of lb-amp plates prior to iptg induction - but in no case overnight at  <dig> c because of excessively accumulating bacterial biomass - yielded acceptable results for strep-tag constructs in comparison to empty vector reference . despite leaky basal expression and hence observable differences even at time point  <dig> , iptg induction definitively triggered increased peptide expression levels, thereby delivering more consistent results. our applied low concentration of  <dig> % tween- <dig> as weak non-ionic detergent lysed enough bacterial cells to release sufficient recombinant material for immediate immobilization, but simultaneously maintained the ability of fluorescent control proteins to emit light , suggesting that it does not denature peptides/proteins but instead preserves their native  conformation. strep-tagi, strep-tagii and dim12g were further exploited for fine-tuning printing densities , and were enclosed as internal controls in subsequent chip assembly efforts for standardization, quality estimation, affinity assessment, as well as inter-blot normalisation.


bona fide performance in large-scale discovery screening was in a next step addressed by assembling random peptide chips from comprehensive random recombinant peptide libraries, all prepared by in-house up-scaled recombinational cloning procedures  <cit> . these libraries were designed to carry either a linear or a cyclically constrained degenerate nnk triplet configuration , thereby incorporating all  <dig> natural aa  yet merely one single amber tag stop codon  <cit> . transformation efficiencies, overall insert diversities, and lack of apparent bias were determined for all independently cloned entry and destination resources  by counting the number of e. coli clones grown on antibiotics-supplemented lb agar plates, followed by sequencing  <dig> randomly picked single e. coli clones each. following the above-established workflow,  <dig> hits  could be selected.fig.  <dig> recombinant peptide chip optimization. a assessment of best e. coli growth intervals for consistent chip performance. a series of e. coli cells transformed with either strep-tag constructs or empty vector were imprinted on nitrocellulose, grown thereon for the specified period, then exposed to iptg, and subsequently lysed. released peptides were analysed for their interaction with hrp-labeled streptavidin. b signal intensities  between strep-tagii and dim12g were evaluated in relation to empty vector control, as indicated. different peptide spot numbers per single standardized microtiter plate well are compared. c consistent pin performance and maximal detection sensitivity were assessed by spotting a dilution series of biotinylated test protein. d steps required for recombinant peptide chip assembly




candidate b <dig>  was uncovered from altogether screened  <dig>  random peptides arbitrarily selected from  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones of linear nonamers. f <dig>  , on the other hand, was extracted from  <dig>  spotted random cyclic hexamers  by directly dispensing diluted transformation mixes and re-analysing positive pools on single-clone level. the success rate was therefore  <dig> binders from  <dig>  screened recombinant peptides. since dim12g, a fusion of strep-tagi and strep-tagii monomers, performs superior in comparison to a single monomer, our identified candidates b <dig> and f <dig>  were subsequently dimerized , and investigated for increased affinity . whilst the hrp-streptavidin mediated signals remained fairly constant for both f <dig>  mono- and dimer, b <dig> monomer functioned slightly better than its merged counterpart. in both cases we could not increase affinity by linear dimerization, indicating that our hits rather function in a monomeric state.

chip-derived hits can be confirmed in independent assays, underscoring target binding specificity
we confirmed chip-derived hits b <dig> and f <dig>  in cell-free assays , ruling out false-positives . an fp assay - conceptually based on rotational differences between labeled peptides free in solution versus complexed to an interactor - was arranged for chemically synthesized 5’fam-labeled peptides strep-tagi, strep-tagii, b <dig>  and f <dig> . we monitored expected dose-dependent increases in polarization with increasing amounts of recombinant protein for strep-tagi  and streptag ii . saturation binding could also be observed for b <dig>  as well as f <dig>  . despite differences in slopes and amplitudes, both interaction potential and target specificity were in this way evaluated. secondly, label-free biolayer interferometry  was measured on a disposable streptavidin-coated biosensor which we exposed to respective peptides, thereby leading to an increase in optical thickness at the tip and, simultaneously, a real-time measurable wavelength shift  proportional to binding. the calculated kd values were  <dig>  μm for the strep-tagii positive control , 105 μm for f <dig> , and  <dig>  μm for b <dig>  although peptide solvent, applied assay buffer and the fact that only a single analyte concentration was tested admittedly influence detected outcomes, achieved results appear consistent with above data.

further engineering efforts might transform extracted hits into suitable binders
in order to evaluate whether b <dig> or f <dig>  might be directly used as novel western blot detection or even as affinity purification agents, we equipped an exemplary 6xhis-tagged test protein  with respective peptides . comparable signals were observed on both dot-blot  and western blot  level for strep-tagi and strep-tagii in crude lysed cell extracts or soluble supernatants . hpq-containing b <dig> could be successfully detected as well, albeit at reduced intensity. we next tried to affinity-purify all  <dig> tagged proteins  by magnetic streptavidin beads under physiological buffer conditions. consistent with above results, b <dig> performed acceptably , whilst f <dig> -tagged clfb could only be detected in an α-6xhis antibody control blot.

discussion
recombinant peptide chips take advantage of directly growing, inducing and lysing library-transformed e. coli clones on a single nitrocellulose membrane for subsequent screening with labelled proteins or compounds, thereby constituting a htp-compatible alternative to presently available synthetic chemistry setups. we have previously already demonstrated the theoretical feasibility of proposed tactic by mapping the roughly specified epitope of a commercial antibody against vitamin d <dig> receptor by screening  <dig> overlapping peptides to a  <dig> aa encompassing continuous stretch  <cit> . many methodical aspects have since then been fine-tuned , amongst them in-depth evaluation of most optimal e. coli growth and iptg induction times/temperatures, printing densities , etc. in continuation, the present work now examines recombinant peptide chips under optimized conditions  by basically exploiting the well-described interactions between streptavidin and short artificial strep-tag i , strep-tag ii  as well as a 12g–linker spaced dimer as internal controls and reference . strep-tag i specifically binds to a proteolytically truncated ‘core’ version of streptavidin by occupying the same pocket where biotin as the natural ligand with a dissociation constant around 10−15 m normally gets non-covalently complexed  <cit> . it was isolated from a genetic library as novel affinity reagent for the purification of fusion proteins on streptavidin matrices at high purity and maintained functionality/bioactivity. systematic optimizations have over the years yielded strep-tag ii  which exhibits not only higher intrinsic affinity towards streptactin, but also permits greater flexibility in choice of attachment site   <cit> . further parallel in vitro selection attempts have parenthetically brought about the  <dig> aa encompassing sbp-tag with an equilibrium dissociation constant of  <dig>  nm  <cit> , and the 9mer  or 15mer  nano-tags with their nanomolar affinities  <cit> .fig.  <dig> performance of literature-validated strep-tags in our recombinant peptide chip setup, and comparison of target binding affinities to two novel chip-derived binders. a nature and diversity of random peptide expression libraries applied for this study. b detailed comparison of both known  and novel streptavidin/streptactin binders. sbp and nanotags  have not been included in the present study. wb, western blot

we screened streptavidin  against our recombinant peptide chips. the latter were built from either linear or disulfide-bond constrained cyclic libraries. respective peptide populations  consisted on average of 6 ×  <dig> to more than 1 ×  <dig> diverse single clones . despite this substantial combinatorial diversity , this number still represents an only sparse sampling of the theoretically possible combinatorial library diversity. the theoretical sequence space is up to  <dig> or  <dig> inserts, for an exhaustive hexamer or nonamer library, respectively. at present, a maximum of  <dig>  spots can be displayed on a standard microtiter-plate sized membrane . this number is several orders smaller than feasible in typical y2h or phage display screening sceneries, and represents only a tiny fraction of the theoretical possible diversity of a nonamer/hexamer library. this challenge was compensated by parallelization, i.e., by performing either many simultaneous screens, or by initiating elaborate pooling schemes  that initially test pools, e.g.  <dig> clones per array position first  and subsequently re-analyse positive pools on single-insert level. in doing so,  <dig> streptavidin binders could be successfully uncovered, i.e., candidate b <dig> from a representative number of  <dig>  linear nonamers, and f <dig>  from  <dig>  tested cyclically constrained hexamers. this number is still far below cell-based screening techniques, however completely cell-free and based on a biochemical principle, which increases the chance that first hits are confirmed with usually used confirmation methods . practically considered, a number of ~500 k different peptides represents an impressive and useful diversity for screening approaches. candidate b <dig>  of note, contains the typical hpq core consensus motif characteristic for biotin mimetics, underscoring that recombinant peptide chips built from such random libraries indeed constitute a source for specific, functional target binders  <cit> . the lower affinity compared to the original strep-tags for both streptavidin and streptactin can be explained by the flanking aa residues that alter the conformation of the central hpq tripeptide. f <dig>  with its attached cysteine residues, in contrast, does not contain any known pattern  <cit> , and can hence be considered as a new peptide with a different binding mechanism.

the specificities of b <dig> and f <dig>  were finally re-evaluated in complementary experimental setups. for technical confirmation, we used fluorescence polarization and bio-layer interferometry, which delivered also affinity data. a functional evaluation was based on recombinant expression and affinity purification of a tagged test protein. the measured dissociation constants of b <dig> and f <dig>   further corroborated target binding specificities, albeit at significantly lower affinities compared to the enclosed strep-tag positive controls. b <dig>  could on western blot level be successfully detected in crude bacterial cell lysates, and proved even functional in affinity purification of clfb on streptavidin beads. these latter  <dig> applications were, in contrast, not feasible with f <dig> , indicating most likely sterical or conformational problems of this tag in fusion to the test protein, calling for further engineering/maturation efforts .

CONCLUSIONS
our recombinant peptide chip technology couples the merits of recombinant protein technologies and combinatorial cloning strategies with high-density peptide chip assembly and high-throughput screening . features like conceptual straightforwardness, robustness and cost-effectiveness along with sensitivity, consistency as well as fast turnaround times equip this scalable, easily upscaling feasible setup with promising applications. examples range from epitope mapping  to systematic alanine substitutions, replacement studies , truncation scans  and finally positional or scrambled  peptide library screenings. unbiased examinations of comprehensive peptide collections without any a priori knowledge, or, of an entire proteome translated into sets of overlapping peptides might yield unexpected associations missed in limited throughput. on the other hand, customized content  can be launched without any size constraints, enabling a further maturation of interaction strengths or target specificities. peptides uncovered by high-density recombinant peptide chips might therefore offer new possibilities for diagnostic, therapeutic, and basic research purposes. in summary, we could here present the construction and practical application of recombinant peptide chips in a large scale approach which is neither technically nor economically feasible by synthetical peptide strategies.
