BACKGROUND
cancer is one of the main public health problems in the united states and worldwide  <cit> . among the diverse types of neoplasia, prostate cancer is the third most common cancer in the world  <cit> , being ranked as the second leading cause of death in men, the first being lung cancer  <cit> . its incidence and mortality varies in different parts of the world, being highest in western countries, mainly among africans  <cit> .

with the widespread use of the prostate-specific antigen  test, more men are examined, and consequently, identification of patients with asymptomatic low-stage tumors has increased considerably  <cit> . although the majority of prostate cancers is confined to the prostate gland, rarely affecting life expectancy, in about 30% of the cases, a specialized group of cells from the primary tumor mass may invade and colonize other distant tissues causing death, therefore, metastatic disease rather than the primary tumor itself is responsible for death, causing the prognosis to be directly related to the spread of the tumor. unfortunately, the therapeutic approaches used nowadays against advanced stages of prostatic cancers are not effective  <cit> . therefore, it is extremely important to understand the basic molecular biology involved in this disease in order to prevent the progression of the tumor  <cit> . however, the identification and analysis of these molecular mechanisms has been hampered by the heterogeneity and high molecular complexity of the process involved in the development of this disease.

in the last few years, several efforts have been made towards determining the genetic mechanisms involved in the development of this tumor  <cit> . a widely used approach in studying the development of several types of cancers has been the high-throughput gene expression microarray analysis, which has provided a wealth of information about tumor marker genes. conventional methods of microarray data analysis have been systematically used to examine the differentially expressed genes  <cit> , and molecular pathways  <cit>  and discriminative methods have been used in order to identify biomarkers  <cit> .

in general, discriminant studies focus only on the classification accuracy of the method and on a pre-step selection of the features  which best classifies the samples  <cit> . this selection of features is often carried out by selecting a subgroup of the most differentially expressed genes  <cit>  or in a multivariate fashion  <cit> . however, understanding of the structure responsible for regulation of these discriminative set of genes in prostatic cancer is required  <cit> .

many years of intensive research have demonstrated that signaling molecules are organized into complex biochemical networks. these signaling circuits are complicated systems consisting of multiple elements interacting in a multifarious fashion. signaling networks are regulated both in time and space  <cit> ; allow the cell to decide which cellular process  is the most appropriate response for each situation. due to the high connectivity and complexity of these biological systems, small modifications in a few members  of these biochemical networks are sufficient to perturb the whole system  <cit> , consequently resulting in a change on the cell's phenotype  <cit> . frequently, changes in the relative concentration of molecules, such as mrnas and proteins, are the unique parameter analyzed in biological systems. however, the biomolecules' concentration is not the only important variable, but their compartmentalization and diffusion are also determinants of the cell's phenotype. therefore, these approaches are reductionists in defining a good biomarker as the most differentially expressed gene or protein when comparing distinct cellular contexts.

here, we report a cdna microarray-based study in prostatic cancer aimed at understanding why some genes are good predictors in discriminating normal versus tumoral samples and others are not. we demonstrate that the discriminative information between normal and tumoral prostates is related to the change in functional connectivity between certain genes and not necessarily in their differential expression, as has often been assumed. moreover, we present a systematic and straightforward approach based on mlda  to identify putative biomarkers in high dimensional data , and a dependence network analysis in order to interprete sets of discriminative genes. this idea is illustrated in figure  <dig> 

RESULTS
simulation
the combination of pca  + mlda   <cit>  was applied in a simulated data described in the methods section in order to demonstrate that functional connectivity changes may be captured by the proposed approach. figure  <dig> describes the weights in absolute values attributed by mlda to each feature . the features are sorted in a decreasing order of weight. red crosses represent the genes which have their functional connectivity alterated between conditions  <dig> and  <dig>  blue crosses represent the genes which have their connectivities unaltered.

samples classification
applying the pca combined with the mlda approach to all ~ <dig>  genes available in our microarray dataset  <cit> , it was possible to classify the samples with an accuracy of  <dig> % , using a leave-one-out cross validation.

projection matrix ψmlda analysis
the projection matrix ψmlda contains the weights  for each feature . figure  <dig> describes the weights in absolute values attributed by mlda to each gene. the genes are sorted in a decreasing order of weight.

the most informative genes correlated to prostatic cancer
*: genes already described to be related to prostatic cancer. in bold are the genes which do not present statistical evidences to be differentially expressed between normal and tumoral conditions.

we have also manually annotated  this set of  <dig> genes .

putative differentially expressed genes
we have also searched for differentially expressed genes. about 25% of the genes listed in table  <dig> do not present statistical evidence to be differentially expressed between normal and tumoral conditions.

relevance networks
both normal and tumoral relevance networks with the top  <dig> most informative genes were constructed, considering a false discovery rate of 5%, being illustrated in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. nodes in red are the genes which have their functional connectivity  changed considerably between normal versus tumoral conditions, i.e., they become "hubs"   <cit>  in tumoral prostates. "hub" genes were maintained also when relevance networks were constructed under different fdr thresholds .

discussion
firstly, the pca+mlda approach was applied to a simulated data set in order to illustrate that differences in connectivity may be behind the oncogenesis process. sato et al.   <cit>  have already demonstrated in another context  that the information contained in the connectivity may be useful to sample classification. the simulation was performed in a large scale multidimensional condition, where the relevant features  are only 2% . interestinlgy, mlda was able to correctly identify the discriminative features, represented by red crosses in figure  <dig>  notice that the relevant features for discrimination do not present differential expression between conditions  <dig> and  <dig> .

in order to verify whether gene expression data contain the information to discriminate normal from tumoral prostatic samples, we have applied the pca+mlda approach to actual biological data, obtaining a high classification accuracy  by the leave-one-out cross-validation. in this case, we have used all the principal components in order to avoid losing information. pca is applied regarding computational cost and memory limitation. it is important to mention that the numerical results are identical in the absence of the pca step  <cit> . notice that mlda does not require a pre-step feature selection, because it may also work for high dimensional data. therefore, it was possible to include all of the  <dig>  genes of the microarray dataset.

since it was possible to verify that gene expression data retains information for classification, we analyzed the ψmlda projection matrix which contains the weight values for each feature . notice that the majority of the genes shown in figure  <dig> have weights near zero, and only a few genes actually have discriminative information .

by analyzing table  <dig>  it is possible to verify that most of the  <dig> informative genes had already been described in the literature as genes related to cancer  and  <dig> genes had specifically been associated to prostate tumor. interestingly, most of the other  <dig> genes do not have references describing their functionality. therefore, they may be associated to cancer but have not been studied yet. the description of the  <dig> genes in the literature corroborates the results obtained by the pca+mlda method, indicating that these genes are informative to discriminate between normal and tumoral samples. the stability and robustnees of this result were verified by obtaining around 80% of the same top  <dig> genes when five observations were excluded randomly from normal sample and five from tumoral sample in  <dig> re-calculations. for more details about annotation of the top  <dig> genes and the complete list of the ~ <dig>  genes, please see additional file  <dig> 

comparing the weights obtained by mlda and the differentially expressed genes, it is surprising that the most differentially expressed genes are not necessarily the most discriminative ones. in other words, a multivariate combination of genes may be regulating the normal/tumoral state, i.e., the combination of genes may contain more information about normal/tumoral conditions than an univariate differentially expressed gene.

since it is known that a complex network is involved in the regulation of several molecular processes, we further analyzed the dependence network involved in these putative biomarkers in order to gain new insights. the analyis of figures  <dig> and  <dig> indicate that exactly the top seven most discriminative genes described in table  <dig>  have considerably changed their functional connectivity between normal and tumoral conditions as illustrated by red nodes in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  these seven genes become "hubs"  <cit> , i.e., highly connected genes in the tumoral condition, whereas in the normal condition, their connectivity was not different when compared to that of other genes. furthermore, these seven genes maintained the position of the top seven most discriminative ones also when we have re-sampled the samples . a z-value summary table related to these seven genes is illustrated in table  <dig>  z-values increase from normal to tumoral conditions, representing the changes in functional connectivities between these two conditions. the mean z-values were calculated between the "hub" gene and the other  <dig> genes. in addition, in the list of the most discriminative features, there are genes which are more differentially expressed than these seven ones , however, their connectivity did not change. krostka and spang   <cit>  have already suggested that differences in co-regulation between normal/disease states may be related to some pathologies. moreover, sato et al.   <cit>  have reported that changes in networks connectivities may influence classification methods. these reports support our results showing that changes in functional connectivity may be closely related to the normal/tumoral states in prostate and that these changes in dependence may contain an additional information when compared to differential gene expression.

mean z-values obtained by hoeffding's d measure and the corresponding standard errors.

almost all top seven genes identified as the most discriminative features between normal and tumoral phenotypes had previously been described in the literature as being associated to cancer. the only gene that so far has not been correlated to cancer is han <dig>  probably because little is known about this gene . five of these top seven genes namely, mylk, klk <dig>  klk <dig>  ltf and tgm <dig> had already been specifically related to prostate carcinoma .

myosin light chain kinase  is one of them. this enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of a specific serine residue on the  <dig> kd light chain of myosin ii , consequently regulating the actin-myosin ii interaction  <cit> . this reaction is responsible for smoothing muscle contraction/relaxation and organization of the cytoskeleton. due to the central role played by the cytoskeleton in cell division and motility, it has been demonstrated that mylk inhibition induces apoptosis in mammary prostate cancer cells and inhibits the growth of mammary and prostate tumors in rats and mice  <cit> . furthermore, since mlc <dig> phosphorylation is necessary for cell motility  <cit> , mylk inhibition blocks cancer cell invasion and adhesion in vitro. as a result, some reports described the use of mylk inhibitors as anti-cancer agents since they prevent cancer cells migration  <cit> .

klk <dig>  also known as prostate specific antigen , is another gene which presents high functional connectivity in tumoral samples. psa is a serine protease, secreted into seminal plasma, belonging to the human kallikrein gene family, being responsible for semen liquefaction. it is the first fda -approved tumor marker for cancer detection  <cit> . the prostatic gland volume affects the psa level in serum, because it is produced and secreted by prostatic tissue  <cit> . however, increased levels of klk <dig> are also observed in some patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. therefore, elevated psa concentration in patients' plasma may be indicative not only of prostate cancer, but, also of other prostatic pathologies. consequently, the use of psa as a cancer-specific marker is questioned.

nowadays,  <dig> members of the kallikrein family  are described in humans  <cit> . among the klks, the highest homology is found between psa and klk <dig>  in this case, the identity is 78% and 80% at the amino acid and dna level, respectively  <cit> . klk <dig> is another gene that presented functional connectivity changes between normal/tumoral conditions. the ratio of klk <dig> to free psa improves the discrimination of benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer patients  <cit> . in addition, it has already been described that klk <dig> discriminates between high and low grade tumors  <cit> . there is evidence indicating that klk <dig> is more closely correlated to the total volume and higher grade prostate cancers than psa  <cit> .

identification of both of these classic biomarkers of prostate carcinomas , in our list of the most informative genes, provides additional evidence to the hypothesis that functional connectivity changes and not only differential expression levels are highly correlated to normal/tumoral process.

another gene classified as one of the most discriminative prostate cancer biomarkers, whose anti-tumorigenic role has already been described  <cit>  is lactotransferrin . this non-heme iron-binding glycoprotein  <cit>  is found in a variety of biological secretions, such as semen, as well as in several secretions derived from glandular epithelium cells, including the prostate. ltf mrna and protein levels are downregulated in prostate cancer, with significant psa recurrence associations, due to promoter silencing by hypermethylation  <cit> . it has been reported that bovine lactotransferrin significantly inhibits colon, esophagus, lung, bladder and liver cancers in rats  <cit> . prostate cancer cells treated with ltf presented high apoptotic response, growth arrest at g <dig> and reduced s phase, suggesting a role for specific cell cycle regulatory mechanisms in ltf-mediated cell growth inhibition  <cit> .

csrp <dig>  and tgm <dig>  are two other genes that become "hubs"  <cit>  along tumoral development. the former belongs to the csrp family, encoding a group of lim domain proteins, which may be involved in regulatory processes which are important for development and cellular differentiation. hirasawa and collaborators   <cit>  suggest the use of csrp as an important biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma malignancy, because csrp <dig> is inactivated in this model by aberrant methylation  <cit> . the latter, tgm <dig> was described as a candidate biomarker of region-specific epithelial identity in the prostate  <cit> , being involved in the formation of stable protein-protein or protein-polyamide bounds  <cit> .

therefore, the literature supports the suggestion that these top seven genes  may be considered as the most closely and informative prostate cancer biomarkers. consequently, this suggests that the malignant transformation process in prostatic tissue is more correlated to functional connectivity changes in the gene dependence networks than differential gene expression itself.

almost all of the  <dig> genes identified by pca+mlda are correlated to cancer, and, in many cases, to prostate cancer. thus, timp <dig> and adamts <dig>  are genes classically correlated to invasion and the metastatic process, the main cancer attributes responsible for death.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our main goal using pca+mlda was not dimension reduction or verification of the classification accuracy, but to investigate the discriminative characteristics extracted from the whole microarray dataset and how one can interpret them, although this procedure may also be used for classification, yielding good results, as previously described.

we have demonstrated that changes in functional connectivity may underly the biological process which render some genes more informative to discriminate between normal and tumoral conditions. using the proposed pca+mlda method in order to analyze the multivariate gene characteristic, it was possible to capture the changes in dependence networks which are related to cell transformation. identification of seven genes  which have their connectivity altered between normal/tumoral conditions may provide novel insights into specific targets against tumor progression.
