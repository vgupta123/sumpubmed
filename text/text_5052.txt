BACKGROUND
bacteria produces different kinds of antimicrobial substances including ribosomally synthesized bacteriocins and non-ribosomally synthesized antibiotics or lipopeptides as a part of their defense strategies in complex environments such as fermented foods and the human gut. members belonging to the lactic acid bacteria  family with ability to produce bacteriocins are frequently found in these environments  <cit> . lab strains are recognized as gras  microorganisms and have been studied in detail for biotechnological applications together with the bacteriocins produced by these strains  <cit> . members of the genus pediococcus are classified within the lab family and are reported to produce bacteriocins without post-translational modifications that are classified under class ii bacteriocins  <cit> . the bacteriocins classified under class iia are called as pediocin-like bacteriocins because the first antimicrobial peptide of this class  was isolated from pediococcus sp.  <cit> . they include variable size peptides ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda  with high sequence homology, disulfide bonds and a conserved motif ygngvxc in their n-terminal domain  <cit> . however, bacteriocins lacking the consensus motif are also classified under pediocin-like bacteriocins  <cit> . initially pediocin-like bacteriocins were reported to be produced by members of the genus pediococcus  <cit>  but later were also isolated from members of other genera like lactobacillus, enterococcus and bacillus . since pediocin-like bacteriocins are well-known to inhibit the growth of food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria listeria monocytogenes, they are also termed as anti-listerial bacteriocins and considered as potential antimicrobial additives for food preservation. though pediocin producing members of the genus pediococcus are largely isolated from dairy products, they have also been reported from diverse environments including human stool sample  <cit> . however, pediocin-like bacteriocins produced by different isolates exhibited 40-60% similarity in their amino acid sequence  <cit> . among the known variants of pediocin-like bacteriocins, pediocin pa- <dig> is well-studied  <dig>  kda antimicrobial peptide with thermo-stability and wide ph range activity  <cit> . nevertheless, it was inactivated by proteases like pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, proteinase k and pronase e  <cit> . further, structure of the pediocin pa- <dig> revealed presence of two β-strands connected by a β-hairpin made up of five amino acid residues in their n-terminal sequence that play an important role in antimicrobial activity . in this study, we describe the isolation, purification and characterization of a novel antimicrobial peptide produced by p. pentosaceus strain ie- <dig> isolated from a dairy effluent sample  <cit> .

RESULTS
growth conditions and antibacterial activity assay
p. pentosaceus strain ie- <dig> showed very little growth while grown in aerobic conditions and optimal growth was observed under anaerobic conditions. the  <dig> h cell free fermented broth  of p. pentosaceus strain ie- <dig> grown in anaerobic broth displayed antimicrobial activity against different indicator strains in well diffusion assay . in contrast to typical narrow spectrum activity shown by pediocin-like bacteriocins  <cit> , the antimicrobial peptide produced by strain ie- <dig> inhibited growth of gram-positive and gram-negative indicator strains. the most sensitive strain among the test strains was micrococcus luteus that showed a  <dig> mm zone of inhibition. there was no activity observed against other strains of pediococcus, yeasts and fungi. a curve displaying antimicrobial production versus bacterial growth showed that the antimicrobial peptide production was initiated during early log phase  which increased to a maximum level by initial stationary phase  and remained constant thereafter . antimicrobial activity was obtained when the p. pentosaceus strain ie- <dig> was grown in different media including minimal medium with optimal production obtained in media like anaerobic broth, mrs and reinforced clostridial broth, the latter containing reducing agents . significant delay was observed to reach exponential growth phase by strain ie- <dig> while growing in minimal media that resulted in slow antimicrobial production .table  <dig>

purification of antimicrobial peptide
the crude extract obtained by diaion hp <dig> chromatography showed significant increase in antimicrobial activity compared to cfb. gel electrophoresis analysis of this extract displayed a peptide band between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda on tricine sds-page that showed antimicrobial activity against l. monocytogenes in in-gel activity assay . direct detection of antimicrobial activity by in-gel activity assay revealed that the inhibition was caused by a low molecular weight  peptide. the extract was purified on a cation exchange column and the active fraction obtained was used for gel filtration chromatography analysis that anticipated the molecular mass to be in the range of  <dig>  -  <dig>  kda . the purified peptide showed a single peak in reversed phase hplc with absorbance between 260–280 nm  that may be due to the presence of aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine. during storage of the purified peptide at room temperature significant reduction in antimicrobial activity was observed within 24 h, but was stable when stored at −20°c. subsequently, it was found that the loss of antimicrobial activity was due to oxidation of peptide as observed for pediocin-like bacteriocins  <cit> .figure  <dig>

molecular mass analysis and de novo sequencing of lmw peptide
the molecular mass for lmw antimicrobial peptide was determined as  <dig>  da  by maldi-tof ms. the primary structure of the peptide by ms/ms sequencing revealed the sequence as apvpfsctrgclthlv with high score value of  <dig>  . the mass obtained in maldi-tof is in agreement with the estimated theoretical average mass  obtained for the sequence. minor differences in mass may be due to the instrument error which deviates up to 50 ppm. further, bioinformatics analysis of the sequence did not show any significant similarity with known pediocin-like bacteriocins or other bacterial amps available with databases like bactibase  <cit>  or collection of antimicrobial peptide  database  <cit> . in fact, the de novo sequence was used for blast analysis against the published genome of strain ie- <dig>  but could not find any significant blast hit covering the entire peptide sequence in the annotated proteins. further, genome sequence analysis to find the orf coding this peptide did not show any significant similarity. in this regard, it is pertinent to note that the genome of ie- <dig> is a draft version, hence, putative region encoding the small peptide may have missed in the draft genome due to gaps formed during the assembly of raw sequence data . considering ambiguities in de novo sequencing, search was also made by replacing leu residue with ile as well as other de novo sequences obtained with low score values, however, no orf was found in genome sequence. as no orf detected in genome, it is anticipated that antimicrobial peptide might be produced from medium components by the strain ie- <dig>  nevertheless, synthesis of peptide from the medium components is ruled out as the peptide production was observed in minimal medium containing an inorganic nitrogen source. though the de novo sequence similarity search using apd <dig>  <cit>  revealed low similarity  with the eukaryotic antimicrobial peptide, temporin ltb, it did not show any conserved motifs observed for temporins  <cit> . antimicrobial peptide prediction analysis  <cit>  of the de novo sequence suggested that the peptide could be a potential antimicrobial peptide with the presence of cationic, aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids, along with two cysteine residues. moreover, this lmw peptide shares an amino acid arrangement with n-terminal sequence of other pediocin-like bacteriocins such as pediocin pa- <dig>  <cit> . remarkably, the five amino acids  of the peptide showed amino acids pattern similarity with β-hairpin composition  of pediocin-like bacteriocins  <cit>  where the positively charged amino acid play crucial role in antimicrobial activity  <cit> . in fact, addition of a positively charged amino acid within this patch showed significant increase in antimicrobial activity of pediocin pa- <dig>  <cit> . additionally, structure prediction analysis for the lmw peptide showed antiparallel β-sheet confirmation  where hydrophobic and positively charged amino acids are enclosed by two cysteine residues .figure  <dig>

effect of ph, temperature, proteolytic enzymes, reducing agent and h2o <dig> on antimicrobial activity
the lmw antimicrobial peptide was found to be thermo-stable as there was no reduction observed in its antimicrobial activity even after 30 min of incubation at 100°c. however, it displayed sensitivity towards the ph as the maximum activity was observed at ph  <dig> and significant loss was found at ph  <dig> and above . unlike pediocin-like bacteriocins, the low molecular weight peptide in this study was found to be resistant to proteolytic cleavage as an antimicrobial assay performed upon incubation with proteolytic enzymes showed no reduction in activity. stable activity upon treatment with amylase revealed the absence of any sugar moiety associated with inhibition activity of the bacteriocin. interestingly, the peptide showed significant increase in antimicrobial activity when it was tested upon incubation with dtt . the increase in activity was observed with the increase in dtt concentration up to 150 mm . however, peptide incubated with h2o <dig> did not show any antimicrobial activity confirming the inactivation of lmw peptide upon oxidation. results of control dtt experiments showed no effect on the growth of indicator strains.table  <dig>

determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of the lmw peptide
determination of minimum inhibitory concentration  for various indicator organisms revealed that the peptide was most active against m. luteus of gram-positive strains with an mic value of  <dig>  μm. among the gram-negative strains, v. cholera growth was inhibited at  <dig>  μm concentration. the mic values observed for the peptide were higher when compared to other pediocin-like bacteriocins, however, mic determined for peptide treated with dtt were found to be significantly lower than the native peptide . again, m. luteus, l. monocytogenes and v. cholera were observed as the most sensitive, however, test strains like b. subtilis and e. coli were inhibited more efficiently with the dtt treated peptide compared to native peptide. hemolysis of rabbit rbcs was not observed at concentrations up to 100 μm of peptide.

CONCLUSIONS
although production of lmw antimicrobial peptides from different bacteria was reported in the literature, no peptide of less than  <dig>  kda was reported from pediococcus species. pediocin-like bacteriocins are produced by the pediocin biosynthetic gene cluster pedabcd that are highly conserved among pediococcus strains, however, strains like p. acidilactici did not produce any antimicrobial substance though it contained pediocin biosynthetic gene cluster. similarly, the draft genome sequence of strain ie- <dig> in this study showed presence of pediocin biosynthetic gene cluster pedabcd but did not produce any pediocin-like bacteriocin. we conclude that p. pentosaceus strain ie- <dig> produces a lmw antimicrobial peptide with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity that is resistant to proteases. therefore, it may be used effectively against food spoilage bacteria and developed as an efficient preservative for processed foods in food industry.
