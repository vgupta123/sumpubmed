BACKGROUND
the ubiquitin  proteasome system  is a major intracellular protein degradation pathway. the central protein of this pathway is ub, a highly conserved  <dig> amino acid polypeptide that is conjugated to target proteins through a hierarchal enzyme cascade consisting of a ub-activating enzyme , a ub-conjugating enzyme , and a ub ligase . e3s can be single proteins or multi-subunit complexes that recruit and facilitate the transfer of ub to substrates. humans have at least two e1s, 36– <dig> e2s, and up to  <dig> e3s  <cit> . thus, a single e <dig> can partner with a host of e3s, and, likewise, a given e <dig> can engage multiple e2s. ubiquitylation targets recipient proteins to a number of fates, the best studied of which is degradation by the 26s proteasome. ubiquitylation has also been shown to regulate protein localization, dna repair, signal transduction, and a host of other functions . a distinct class of enzymes collectively referred to as de-ubiquitylating enzymes, or dubs, counter ubiquitylation by removing ub from substrates. the balance between ubiquitylation and de-ubiquitylation must therefore be finely tuned to maintain proteostasis and cellular fidelity.

dysregulation of the ups is associated with many pathologies, including cardiovascular, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases. ups activity decreases in normal aging as well as in alzheimer’s disease  <cit> , parkinson’s disease  <cit> , and age-related macular degeneration  <cit> . consequently, a cardinal hallmark of these diseases is the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates; these are often associated with oxidative and proteotoxic stress and damage  <cit> . in most disorders, it remains to be determined if decreased ups activity is a primary cause or a secondary consequence of these neurodegenerative pathologies.

a great deal of work has been done to characterize the biochemical mechanisms employed by e2s and e3s, but few studies have focused on cataloging the expression profiles of these enzymes in different organs, tissues, and cell types. in the work reported here, we analyzed the protein expression profile of ubcm <dig> in the brain. this enzyme is a highly-conserved metazoan e <dig> that plays roles in proteasome-mediated turnover of proteins  <cit> , cell cycle progression  <cit> , and regulation of the antioxidant transcription factor, nrf <dig>  <cit> . the human and mouse protein sequences of ubcm <dig> are identical, and the human form is called ube2e <dig>  although a comprehensive assessment of the in vivo functions of ubcm <dig> has not been performed in higher organisms, a functional homolog in yeast has been shown to mediate the degradation of misfolded and oxidatively-damaged proteins  <cit> . we have previously shown that the enzyme is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body but is enriched in the retina and brain in mice  <cit> . we further characterized the expression profile in the neuroretina as well as the retinal pigment epithelium  <cit> . subsequently, high throughput screens for protein–protein interactions revealed that ubcm <dig> interacts with the huntington’s disease proteins htt  <cit>  and rnf <dig>  <cit>  and with the spinocerebellar ataxia-associated protein atxn <dig>  <cit> . more recently, ubcm <dig> was shown to play a major role in the ubiquitylation status of tdp- <dig>  a dna-binding protein found in aggregates of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration  <cit> . these interactions prompted us to carry out a cell type- and structure-specific immunofluorescence analysis of ubcm <dig> in mouse brain tissue and to determine if expression of the enzyme is altered in aged mice. we report here the first assessment of the localization and abundance of an e <dig> in the brain. this study serves as a launching point for the characterization of e2s in both healthy and pathological brains with the hopes of better understanding how ups deficits contribute to neuropathologies.

RESULTS
validation of the α-ubcm <dig> antibody
to determine the protein expression profile of ubcm <dig> in mouse brain, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the n-terminal  <dig> residues of ubcm <dig> was affinity purified and validated in hela cells treated with either control sirna  or ubcm2-specific sirna . 3 days post-sirna treatment, cells were fixed and immunostained with α-ubcm <dig> and nuclei were counterstained with dapi. α-ubcm <dig> labeling revealed that the enzyme localized to the nucleus , as we reported previously  <cit> , and that the knockdown efficiency was 60–70 % . western blot analysis from human retinal pigment epithelial cell-derived lysates treated with sicon or siubcm <dig> shows a single band at the size of ubcm <dig>  in sicon-treated cells and loss of the band in siubcm2-treated cells . additional validation of α-ubcm <dig> came from analyzing mouse embryo fibroblasts  harboring floxed alleles of ubcm <dig> and stably transduced with trimethoprim-inducible cre recombinase. as shown in fig. 1c, cre was induced in three of the four cells in the field and led to ablation of the α-ubcm <dig> signal in all three cells. the cell lacking cre expression retained ubcm <dig> immunolabeling. in cell lysates derived from mouse cerebellum  and cortex , α-ubcm <dig> detected a single band of the predicted migration for the enzyme .fig.  <dig> validation of α-ubcm <dig> antibody. a hela cells were treated with 12 pmol of control sicon sirna  or ubcm2-specific sirna  for 72 h before fixation and immunostaining with α-ubcm <dig> . nuclei were counterstained with dapi . 60×, size bar 10 µm. b rpe- <dig> cells were treated with sicon  or siubcm <dig>  for 72 h and solubilized for western blot analysis with α-ubcm <dig>  anti-β-tubulin is used as a loading control. c ubcm2flox/flox mefs expressing an inducible cre recombinase were fixed and labeled with dapi , α-ubcm <dig> , and α-cre .  <dig> of the  <dig> cells express cre and lose ubcm <dig> expression whereas the non-cre expressing cell retains ubcm <dig> expression. d cell lysates prepared from mouse cerebellum  and cortex  were analyzed by α-ubcm <dig> western blot analysis

we next co-immunolabeled sagittal brain sections with α-ubcm <dig> and antibodies specific for various cell types resident in brain. co-staining with an antibody against the nuclear neuronal marker neun revealed that the overwhelming majority of ubcm <dig> is expressed in neurons and that essentially all neurons express the enzyme . ubcm <dig> expression was also consistently observed in cnpase-positive oligodendrocytes throughout brain . within the limits of detection of the ubcm <dig> antibody, the enzyme was minimally detected or absent in most microglia, labeled by α-iba <dig> staining , and in astrocytes, labeled by α-gfap staining . curiously, a subpopulation of microglia and astrocytes displayed robust ubcm <dig> expression, examples of which are depicted in representative images of hippocampal ca <dig> sections . what distinguishes these rare cells from the remainder of glial cells that do not express detectable levels of ubcm <dig> remains to be determined. due to the prevalence of ubcm <dig> in neun-positive cells , we focused the remainder of this study on quantitatively analyzing the relative expression levels of ubcm <dig> in neurons.fig.  <dig> ubcm <dig> is expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes but is undetectable in most microglia and astrocytes. representative images from stained 7 μm, paraffin-embedded sagittal c57bl/ <dig> brain sections of dorsal cortex and ca <dig>  along with cerebellum  or thalamus . a nuclear neuronal marker neun  and ubcm <dig>  with yellow indicating colocalization in the merged images . b–d co-staining with cell type-specific marker cnpase for oligodendrocytes , iba <dig> for microglia , or gfap for astrocytes  shown in green with hoechst  to mark nuclei or with ubcm <dig> . white arrowheads indicate oligodendritic , microglial , or astrocytic  nuclei. 60×, size bar 10 µm

ubcm <dig> expression is modestly decreased in aged mouse brain
as the function and efficiency of the ups decline with age , we next compared the expression levels of ubcm <dig> in the brains of young and aged mice. young mice were 1–4 months old, and aged mice ranged from 10–25 months. sagittal brain sections were examined for neuronal ubcm <dig> expression as measured by average cellular α-ubcm2-derived fluorescence intensity in neun-positive nuclei. an analysis consisting of  <dig> distinct substructures revealed a modest but statistically significant global decrease of ubcm <dig> expression of  <dig>  %  in aged animals as compared to their strain-matched, younger counterparts . five substructures in particular  exhibited statistically significant decreases of 10 % or more as a function of age .fig.  <dig> ubcm <dig> expression is decreased in aged mouse brains. a representative photomicrographs showing decreased ubcm <dig> expression in aged  relative to young control  brains in the  <dig> structures with >10 % differences. 20×, size bar 30 μm. b average expression of ubcm <dig> in whole brain, consisting of the analysis of  <dig> substructures, indicating a  <dig>  % global decrease in aged brain relative to young control. n =  <dig> in triplicate; p value =  <dig> . c average ubcm <dig> expression in the  <dig> substructures that exhibited a >10 % decrease. asterisks denote p <  <dig> . cb , mc <dig> , on , sc , vc <dig> 



ubcm <dig> expression is unchanged in aged nrf2-deficient brains relative to aged wildtype
we have shown that ubcm <dig> regulates nrf <dig>  <cit> , an antioxidant transcription factor that induces the expression of genes encoding cytoprotective proteins and enzymes involved in redox homeostasis and proteostasis . thus, genetic ablation of nrf <dig> is predicted to increase the abundance of oxidatively-damaged proteins destined for ub-mediated degradation. nonetheless, we did not observe altered levels or expression patterns of ubcm <dig> in aged cohorts of this knockout strain relative to age-and strain-matched controls . consistent with these data, we found by western blotting that the brains of these animals do not accumulate polyub aggregates or heat shock protein  <dig> , markers of disrupted proteostasis , or have increased anti-ub labeling in paraffin sections . these data indicate that the steady-state level of overt proteotoxic stress in nrf <dig> knockout brains is relatively minimal. curiously, these knockout mice reportedly undergo spontaneous retinal degeneration in an age-dependent fashion  <cit> . we surmise that this phenotype is a function of the retina being exposed to the additional stress derived from constant photo-oxidative challenge throughout the life of the animal.fig.  <dig> ubcm <dig> expression is not altered in nrf2-deficient brains. a average expression of ubcm <dig> in whole brain, consisting of the analysis of  <dig> substructures, indicating no change in aged, nrf2-deficient brain relative to aged, strain-matched controls. n =  <dig> in triplicate. b western blot analyses of nrf <dig> knockout and age/strain-matched wt mice to detect markers of proteotoxicity and stress. antibodies used are listed to the right of each panel, and the age and genotype of the mice are indicated above each lane. the positive control  for hsp <dig> induction and the accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins is from retinal pigment epithelium  cells treated for 8 h with 10 µm proteasome inhibitor mg <dig> and harvested with  <dig> times concentrated laemmli buffer. the vertical line between lanes  <dig> and  <dig> represents a lane in which molecular weight markers were run. the migration of these markers is indicated to the left. c representative photomicrographs of dentate gyrus  and cerebellum  from aged nrf2-deficient  and strain-matched control  brains immunolabeled with an α-ubiquitin antibody

discussion
the principal advance of this work is that it represents the first description of the cell- and structure-specific expression and distribution of a ups e <dig> in the mouse brain. our previous studies to develop a global ubcm <dig> knockout mouse strain resulted in a failure to produce homozygous knockouts, consistent with ubcm <dig> loss causing embryonic lethality  and knockdown of the enzyme inducing a cell cycle arrest/exit  <cit> . the expression profiling described in the present study is therefore a requisite first step for directing future efforts at genetically ablating the enzyme in specific anatomical structures of the brain. such knockouts could provide useful models to determine if and how ups deficits contribute to neurodegeneration.

by immunological staining of paraffin-embedded murine brain sections with a highly specific antibody, we found that ubcm <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes but is undetectable in the majority of microglia and astrocytes . these data largely reflect transcriptional profiling data for isolated astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes showing enrichment of the ubcm <dig> transcript , as well as many other components of the ups, in neurons and oligodendrocytes relative to astrocytes  <cit> . approximately half the amount of ubcm <dig> mrna was detected in astrocytes relative to neurons, and this level of astrocyte expression is likely due to the fact that the isolated cells were derived from very young mouse brains and cultured several days before analysis. ubcm <dig> is expressed in replicating cells and is necessary for cell replication  <cit> . consistent with this, we hypothesize that the rare population of ubcm2-expressing astrocytes and microglia are likely replicating. due to the prevalence of ubcm <dig> in neurons, we quantified the relative expression of the enzyme in neun-positive nuclei in  <dig> brain structures . we observed relatively robust ubcm <dig> expression in hindbrain and cortical structures and lower expression in hippocampus and several basal ganglia components. as ups dysfunction has been linked to multiple age-associated neuropathologies, we also examined whether ubcm <dig> expression levels change as a function of age. we observed a modest  <dig>  % global decrease in neuronal ubcm <dig> expression in aged brain with a more marked decrease  in  <dig> substructures, namely cerebellar granule cell layer, primary motor cortex, olfactory nucleus, superior colliculus, and secondary visual cortex .

our results are largely consistent with a qrt-pcr analysis of ubcm <dig> mrna localization in mouse embryo  <cit> . similar to our findings of protein expression in adult mice  <cit> , ubcm <dig> mrna was enriched in embryonic brain with lowest expression in heart and intermediate levels in lung, liver, and kidney. within embryonic brain, high mrna levels were detected in cortex and hindbrain, but unlike ubcm <dig> protein expression, the mrna was also enriched in thalamus, midbrain, and hippocampus at various stages of embryonic development. these differences may be attributable to changes in ubcm <dig> expression during development versus post-development and/or a discrepancy between protein and mrna levels due to translational or degradative regulation.

although genetic mutations of ubcm <dig> have not been linked to neurodegeneration to date, the enzyme is highly enriched in numerous brain areas devoted to motor output, including primary and secondary motor cortices, reticular formation, pontine nuclei, facial nucleus, and cerebellum. these data fit with the notion that ubcm <dig> may contribute to motor function and thereby potentially play a role in motor deficits that characterize a number of neurodegenerative diseases. notably, gwas data indicate that ubcm <dig> can interact with atxn <dig>  <cit> , a protein linked to spinocerebellar ataxia . this condition is marked by motor deficits resulting from cerebellar degeneration, dysfunction of both the ups and the mitochondria, and an accumulation of ub-positive aggregates  <cit> . interestingly, ubcm <dig> is enriched in the cerebellum and appears to decline with age . moreover, ubcm <dig> has been shown to ubiquitylate tdp- <dig>  <cit> , a protein involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . als is a motor disease that can result from degeneration of upper motor neurons located in the motor cortex or reticular formation of the brainstem, both of which express relatively high levels of ubcm <dig> . these interactions potentially link the enzyme to the neurodegenerative motor disorders of sca and als. ubcm <dig> could also be linked to non-pathological, age-related motor deficits as the enzyme is abundant in the cortico-ponto-cerebellar tract, an important motor pathway, and decreases in motor cortex and cerebellar granule cells with age. both of these structures degenerate in normal aging and contribute to age-related motor dysfunction  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have performed the first protein expression profiling of a ub-conjugating enzyme in the mouse brain. we show that the class iii e <dig> ubcm <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes but is not prevalent in microglia or astrocytes. by quantifying relative α-ubcm2-derived fluorescence from immunohistochemically stained mouse brain sections, we have determined the relative structure-specific neuronal expression of the enzyme. further, we have observed a modest decrease in neuronal ubcm <dig> expression in particular sub-structures of the aged mouse brain.
