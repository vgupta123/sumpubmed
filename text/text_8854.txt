BACKGROUND
calpains are intracellular cysteine proteases that are tightly regulated both temporally and spatially, as they require the binding of ca2+ for their proteolytic function, and they are activated in a highly localized manner within the cells. calpains are widespread and are implicated in a variety of physiological functions   <cit> . they are also associated with a diverse range of pathological conditions such as alzheimer’s, huntington’s and parkinson’s diseases, multiple sclerosis, ischemic and traumatic brain injury, cancer, muscular dystrophy, cataracts, stroke and diabetes  <cit> . in mammals, they form a superfamily which is comprised of  <dig> cysteine protease catalytic subunits ,  <dig> regulatory subunits and the inhibitor, calpastatin. some of the calpains are expressed ubiquitously, while others have a restricted tissue distribution  <cit> .

the role of calpains in the migration of chinese hamster ovary  cells was demonstrated with the aid of cell-permeable calpain inhibitors and a cell line expressing reduced level of capn <dig>  <cit> . both conditions leading to reduced calpain activity blocked cell migration at higher fibrinogen concentrations, inhibited the cell-substratum detachment at the trailing edge of the cells, and decreased the release of integrins from the cell membrane. from this data it was concluded, that calpain destabilizes the connection between the adhesion complexes and the cytoskeleton at the rear of the moving cells. palecek et al. confirmed that a calpain inhibitor decreased integrin release behind the cells when the rear detachment was the rate limiting step of migration  <cit> . the downregulation of a mammalian capn <dig> by rna interference lead to similar results: the dissociation rate of adhesion complexes was decreased  <cit> . moreover, when a calpain-resistant talin <dig> was expressed in cells with talin <dig> null background, the rate of disassembly of the focal adhesion complexes was also lower indicating that adhesion turnover was regulated by the capn2-mediated cleavage of talin <dig>  <cit> . in addition to talin calpain has a whole array of motility related substrates  <cit> . for example in the focal adhesion complexes two essential scaffolding molecules, focal adhesion kinase fak  <cit>  and paxillin  <cit>  have been recently identified as physiological targets of calpain cleavage. despite remarkable progress, our knowledge about the role of individual calpains during cell migration is incomplete due to the large number and variety of calpains as well as their potential substrate proteins.

in contrast to mammals, the drosophila genome contains only four genes encoding calpain-related proteins. out of these, only calpa and calpb encode canonical, active calpain enzymes. the calpc gene product is an inactive protease, while calpd  encodes an atypical calpain molecule  <cit> . the structural characteristics of the drosophila calpains are very similar to that of the mammalian enzymes, although they have two distinguishing features: the calpa protein carries a  <dig> amino acid long hydrophobic insert in its c-terminal end, and the calpb protein has an unusually long n-terminal tail of  <dig> amino acids. the exact molecular functions of these extra sequences are not known. there are two other distinctive enzymatic characteristics of the drosophila calpains: they do not need small regulatory subunits for their catalytic activity, and their proteolytic function is not regulated by an intrinsic inhibitor as the drosophila genome contains neither regulatory subunit nor calpastatin orthologs. in addition to the smaller number of calpain genes, drosophila also offers a genetically well-tractable model system in which the functions of calpains and their molecular interactions can be studied at the organism level.

movement of the border cells in drosophila egg chambers is a well characterized genetic model of the eukaryotic cell migration  <cit> . using this model, here we demonstrate that calpb but not the structurally related calpa has an important modulator function during in vivo cell migration. based on our molecular-genetic and biochemical results we suggest that one of the potential targets of the calpb catalyzed limited proteolysis is talin, an important component of the focal adhesion complex.

RESULTS
calpa and calpb are not essential genes in drosophila melanogaster
the drosophila melanogaster genome contains two catalytically active canonical calpain genes: calpa and calpb, but little is known about their in vivo roles. to characterize their functions, we generated deletions disrupting each gene. for the calpa, the p{supor-p}calpakg <dig> transposon, inserted 948 bp upstream from the calpa translation initiation site, was mobilized to obtain imprecise excisions. a single line, calpa <dig>  carrying a 2490 bp deletion, was identified by pcr. mapping the breakpoints by sequence analysis revealed that the deficiency removed not only the p element, but 459 bp from the calpa gene including the first untranslated exon and a 1907 bp sequence from the adjacent hts gene . in calpa <dig> homozygous mutant flies, the calpa mrna and the calpa protein were not detectable by rt-pcr and western blot, respectively . homozygous calpa <dig> flies are viable, displaying no external morphological phenotypes, but the females are completely sterile; they do not lay eggs. in their ovaries, egg chamber development is arrested at early stages, reminiscent of the egg chamber phenotype of the female sterile mutants of the hts gene . this female sterility was complemented in the calpa808/dfed3716cg <dig> transheterozygotes. the  <dig>  kb long dfed3716cg <dig> deficiency completely eliminates the fak56d and the calpa genes and 834 bp from the hts gene   <cit>  . both the calpa <dig> and the dfed3716cg <dig> deficiencies affect the regulatory sequences of the hts, which in calpa <dig> results in female sterility. presumably, dfed3716cg <dig> can complement this phenotype because it removes a shorter segment of hts and it does not eliminate those regulatory sequences that are responsible for the female sterility. from these data, we concluded that the female sterility of calpa <dig> originates from the hts gene. however, in a more detailed analysis, it appeared that in calpa808/ dfed3716cg <dig> transheterozygous ovaries 10% of the egg chambers display a mild dumpless phenotype  indicating that the dfed3716cg <dig> deficiency can only partially complement the female sterility in calpa <dig>  in the calpa808/dfed3716cg <dig> transheterozygotes, similarly to the calpa <dig> homozygotes, no mrna and no calpa protein were present . since calpa808/dfed3716cg <dig> flies are viable, calpa can be considered a non-essential gene.

to generate mutations in the calpb gene, the p{epgy2}calpbey <dig> p-element, inserted 175 bp upstream from calpb atg, was mobilized. several imprecise excision lines were recovered, and the breakpoints of two alleles  were identified by sequencing: both of them disrupted the calpb gene only . the longer deficiency, calpb <dig>  removes the p-element and 1047 bp from the calpb gene. as a result of this deletion, the calpb <dig> allele lacks the first 873 bp of the coding sequences of the calpb gene. calpb <dig> encompasses a shorter, 922 bp deletion with an identical starting point. in both the calpb <dig> and the calpb <dig> homozygous flies, truncated mrnas were detected by rt-pcr , but no full length or truncated calpb protein bands were discernible in calpb <dig> by immunoblots . the calpb <dig> deficiency, together with the other isolated deletion alleles , is homozygous viable and fertile, displaying no visible external abnormalities indicating that calpb, similarly to calpa, is not an essential gene in drosophila. to test the possible functional redundancy of the calpa and the calpb genes, a double mutant line ed3716; calpb505/calpb505) was generated which was also fully viable and fertile demonstrating that the calpa and calpb genes do not fulfill any common essential functions.

calpb but not calpa modulates border cell migration in egg chambers
since calpb is not required for vital functions, we investigated whether the calpb mutants display any other developmental perturbations. previous studies revealed that the follicular cells of the drosophila egg chambers are particularly enriched in calpb protein, and the gene is also highly expressed in the migrating border cells  <cit> , which originate from the follicular cells. guided by this cellular localization and by the literature showing that calpains are involved in the regulation of mammalian cell motility, we examined whether the egg chambers from flies carrying calpb mutations display any abnormalities in the migration of border cells. in wild-type egg chambers, the border cells usually reach the anterior end of the oocyte by stage  <dig>  while in calpb homozygous mutants a significant portion of the border cells  do not complete their migration by this stage , indicating that the lack of calpb delays but does not arrest border cell migration. the quantitative analysis of the data  revealed no significant difference between the p{epgy2}calpbey <dig> p-element insertion line and the wild type. the extent of the delay in border cell migration was similar in the calpb <dig> and the calpb <dig> lines. in these mutants, the border cells migrated in the correct direction; no guidance defect was observed. in a calpb <dig> hemizygote containing a large chromosomal deficiency ac1) that removes the entire calpb gene, the border cell migration was also delayed, just as much as in the homozygotes. to verify that the disruption of the calpb gene is responsible for the slow migration, the genomic rescue fragment of the calpb gene, termed cbg <dig>  was introduced into the calpb <dig> mutant. the rescue fragment restored the wild-type phenotype proving that the lack of calpb gene is indeed responsible for the less efficient border cell movement.

as calpb mutations do not block border cell migration completely, the possibility emerged that the other calpain gene, i.e. calpa, may also be involved in the process. to test this hypothesis, egg chambers from calpa808/dfed3716cg <dig> transheterozygous flies were investigated. although calpa protein is not expressed in these flies, the border cells migrate normally . furthermore, the calpa and calpb double mutants display a phenotype characteristic of calpb single mutant indicating that calpa is not required for border cell migration. we confirmed these results by downregulating the expression of the calpa and calpb genes in the border cells via rna interference. the slbo-gal <dig> driver was used to induce calpa or calpb specific rna interference. calpa rnai did not influence border cell migration, but calpb rnai resulted in a similar, delayed migration phenotype as observed in the calpb mutant . consistently with earlier reports  <cit>  the slbo-gal <dig> driver operated rather specifically, it induced gfp expression exclusively in border cells, posterior polar cells, and some follicular cells at the anterior side of the oocytes . consequently, the rna interference results not only confirm the mutant phenotype, but also reveal that calpb is required only in the border cells  in order to regulate their migration.

calpb interacts with the focal adhesion complex proteins
to investigate if the reduced cell motility was related to the focal adhesion complex proteins we silenced the expression of the genes encoding drosophila integrins and talin . as expected from the published data  <cit>  the border cell specific silencing of the myospheroid  gene by rna interference slowed down migration. similar results were obtained when the inflated  and the rhea  genes were silenced: in all cases approx. 30% of the border cells were delayed. in the same rna interference lines, border cell migration was normal when the slbo-gal <dig> driver was absent indicating that the slower migration is due to the reduced expression of the affected genes. after establishing the phenotypes of the silenced lines we tested the genetic interrelationship between the focal adhesion protein coding genes and calpb. the frequency and severity of the migration defect increased when the mysif and rhea genes were downregulated in a homozygous calpb <dig> background . rna interference flies without the slbo-gal <dig> driver in the calpb <dig> background showed the expected 30% mutant migration phenotype resulting from the deletion of the calpb gene alone. thus, our data provide genetic evidence for the functional interaction of calpb with the mysif, and rhea genes.

it is known, that the migration of the border cells takes place in two phases: first they proceed posteriorly from the anterior end of the egg chamber, then, after reaching the oocyte, they move towards the dorsal side, and by stage 10b they are positioned next to the germinal vesicle. the analysis of the second stage of migration is of interest, since some mutations, like gurken influence specifically the dorsal movement of the border cells with little effect on the initial posterior migration  <cit> . by investigating the egg chambers at stage 10b, we found that a significant portion of the border cells  in the calpb <dig> mutants displayed a delay in the dorsal movement . the dorsal migration of the border cells was even more severely delayed when the mysif, and rhea genes were silenced by rna interference in the calpb <dig> mutants: at stage 10b most of the cells  remained at the midline of the egg chambers. our data collectively indicate that the calpb gene is involved both in the posterior and in the dorsal migration of the border cells and interacts with the cell adhesion genes mysif, and rhea.

since in cultured cells the reduction of calpain activity not only delayed motility but also reduced the amount of integrins released from the trailing cell membrane  <cit>  we analyzed the role of calpb in this process under in vivo conditions . the egg chambers were stained for β-ps integrin and the released integrins were visualized as discrete spots behind the border cells in the anterior part of the wild-type egg chambers . in the calpb <dig> mutant, the number of the β-ps integrin-containing spots was significantly reduced . the downregulation of the calpb gene by rna interference had the same effect as the calpb <dig> deletion: in the control slbo-gal <dig> driver strain the number of the released β-ps integrin spots was similar to that of the wild type  while in the slbo-gal <dig> >calpb rnai silenced strain this number was close to that of the calpb <dig> mutant . thus, calpb modulates integrin function in vivo in the border cells during their migration. as we found that the downregulation of the talin-encoding gene, rhea, also had a delaying effect on border cell migration, and this effect was aggravated in a calpb <dig> background , we investigated the effects of the same conditions on integrin release. the silencing of rhea alone in the border cells decreased integrin release to about 60% of the wild-type level  while, the integrin spots were hardly detectable when rhea was silenced in the calpb <dig> mutant background . our data lend additional support for the interaction between rhea and calpb, but at the same time indicate that calpb must act via additional targets, since the talin silencing phenotype  is significantly weaker than the calpain knockdown or deletion phenotypes .

functionally competent talin head-domain abrogates the effects of calpb mutation
to dissect the nature of the calpb-rhea interaction we utilized a construct that overexpresses the globular head domain of talin, which can bind to and activate integrins. in a wild-type genetic background, the expression of a talin head-gfp fusion polypeptide in the border cells did not significantly alter the migration of the border cells, but restored the normal migration rate in calpb <dig> mutant egg chambers . in addition, the expression of a mutant  talin head-gfp <cit> , which is unable to bind β-ps integrin , had no effect on the migration delay of the calpb <dig> border cells . in correlation with the above results, we found that the amount of integrins released at the rear of the border cells was normal when the wild-type talin head-gfp was expressed in the border cells , in calpb <dig> mutant border cells talin head-gfp expression elevated integrin release to the wild-type level , while the talin headr367a-gfp expression had no effect on the calpb <dig> mutant phenotype . with these experiments, we demonstrated that overexpression of a functionally competent talin head suppresses the characteristic phenotypes of the calpb mutant border cells, suggesting that calpb mediates cell migration via the proteolytic release of the head region from talin.

calpain directly interacts with talin
to verify that drosophila talin can act as an in vitro substrate of calpb, embryonic extracts were incubated with purified recombinant calpb. in the presence of ca2+, the cleavage of the full length talin was complete within  <dig> minutes, whereas in the presence of the ca2+ chelator  the full length talin band remained intact . it should be noted, that the recombinant protease required rather high ca2+ concentration for activation, but in the in vitro tests of calpain activity it is commonplace to use the metal ion in the non-physiological mm range  <cit> . the physical interaction between talin and calpb was shown by co-immunoprecipitation . after the incubation of embryonic extracts with anti-talin antibody, calpb was detected in the precipitate. as talin is a potential substrate of calpb, and the two proteins make a physical contact with each other, it is feasible to assume that calpb may function via talin scission in the modulation of cell migration. however, we also noted that talin was partially degraded in an untreated calpb <dig> embryo extract , clearly showing that in the absence of calpb other proteases can digest talin, even if ca2+ was not added.

discussion
comparison of calpain functions in mammals and drosophila
the analysis of calpa808/dfed3716cg <dig> hemizygotes and calpb <dig> homozygous mutants clearly shows that both calpa and calpb are dispensable for viability and fertility while the features of the calpa and calpb double mutant prove that they do not share vital functions during drosophila development. these findings were unexpected since earlier experiments with the mammalian capn <dig> gene  suggested that calpains are required for normal development in mice  <cit> . since the lack of capn <dig> can affect both the capn <dig> and capn <dig> activities, these proteases were investigated separately by knocking out their corresponding genes. the elimination of capn <dig> resulted in early embryonic lethality  <cit> , while the disruption of capn <dig> did not affect viability  <cit>  indicating that from the two ubiquitous calpain genes only one  is indispensable. although the loss-of-function mutation of the capn <dig> gene did not influence viability and fertility, it affected platelet aggregation and clot retraction  <cit> . similarly, disruption of the capn <dig> gene has no lethal consequences; the life span of the mutant was normal, but a moderate loss of sarcolemmal integrity could be detected in the ko mice  <cit> . thus, the mammalian capn <dig> and capn <dig> genes are not essential, but play important modulator roles during development. similarly, we observed that the calpb gene in drosophila is not required for essential physiological functions, but has a modifying role in border cell migration.

although the calpa protein is expressed in all stages of drosophila development  the calpa gene is also dispensable for viability and fertility. it should be noted that our results do not confirm the conclusions of a recent paper  <cit>  reporting that the downregulation of calpa by the microinjection of double stranded rnas resulted in the dorsalization of embryos: a significant portion of the larvae did not hatch and bore cuticule defects. in our case, the larvae of calpa808/dfed3716cg <dig> transheterozygotes displayed no visible dorsoventral patterning abnormalities and exhibited no cuticular defects . they hatched, although the hatching rate of the embryos was somewhat lower than the theoretical ratio owing to dumpless eggs  which did not hatch. fontenele et al.  <cit>  also reported that the downregulation of calpb by rna interference has similar dorsalization effects with very low hatching rate and cuticle defects. however, the embryonic development of our calpb mutants was normal without any reduction in hatching . the discrepancy may be related to the utilization of different genetic tools; we suppose that the developmental defects  <cit>  may have been generated by some off-target effects of the microinjection based silencing approach. since both calpa <dig> and calpb <dig> are protein null alleles, it is likely that neither calpa nor calpb are involved in the establishment of the dorsoventral axis in drosophila. nevertheless, the drosophila calpains may have modulator roles in other cellular processes like cell migration, neuronal functions or phagocytosis. indeed it has been shown recently that the downregulation of calpa by rna interference significantly decreases the s <dig> cell phagocytosis of c. albicans <cit> , and that calpb can modify the effect of the human leukemogenic fusion protein aml1-eto when expressed in drosophila blood cells  <cit> .

in vivo evidence for the involvement of calpb in cell migration
here we provide the first in vivo evidence showing that calpains modulate cell motility at the whole organism level. in calpb mutant egg chambers, border cells display a moderate delay during migration. in our study, we were also able to detect released β-ps integrin behind the border cells in wild-type egg chambers. in the absence of calpb, the released β-ps integrin was markedly reduced in the egg chambers that displayed delayed migration. these results are in correlation with previous data obtained with a mammalian cell line showing that the inhibition of calpain activity decreased the rear detachment rate and gave rise to less integrins to be released from the rear of migrating cells  <cit> . we also noticed that the effects of calpb insufficiency on cell motility were synergistically enhanced when the expression of integrins and talin, the components of the focal adhesion complex, were silenced. however, our data are at variance with an earlier paper  <cit>  reporting that the knocking down of talin has no effect on border cell migration. this discrepancy is especially disturbing since our rna interference construct originates from the same source . the only difference between the two experimental conditions was that we performed the silencing at 30°c while llense and martin-blanco  <cit>  did it at 25°c. to test the importance of the cultivation conditions, we carried out the same rna interference experiments at both temperatures. at 30°c, the penetrance was 29%, while in parallel experiments carried out at 25°c it was only 18% . we conclude that the phenotype exists at both temperatures but can be more readily detected and characterized at 30°c. since llense and martin-blanco  <cit>  used a less graded scoring scale than we, it is possible, that they counted the small migration defect as normal. indeed, the migration phenotypes of the single rhea and calpb knockdown strains are mild but the combination of them results in a strong effect that reveals the role of both genes in border cell migration. thus we are convinced that the genetic interaction between calpb and the focal adhesion protein coding mysif and rhea is a solid fact that we substantiated by two independent methods. we also fund that the above interaction is important for both the posterior and dorsal components of the border cell migration, thus it affects a general aspect of cell motility.

it is more difficult to ascertain the molecular mechanisms underlying the above interactions, because the proteins that we manipulated by molecular genetic methods are members of a large complex characterized by a complicated network of direct and indirect, molecular and functional, interactions. although we demonstrated that drosophila talin is an in vitro substrate of calpb, and the two proteins are in physical contact with each other in embryo extracts we do not have direct evidence for a talin cleavage mediated calpain action in the border cells. we cannot exclude the possibility that the protease acts in talin independent pathways as well, for example via the limited proteolysis of fak  <cit> , paxillin  <cit>  or other  <cit>  potential substrates that affect cell motility. in fact, our integrin release tests show that the effect of talin silencing is less pronounced than the effects of calpb silencing or deletion  suggesting that besides talin other calpain targets must be involved in the process. furthermore, we found that in the calpb <dig> null mutant flies other unidentified proteases can also recognize talin as a substrate . disregarding the uncertainty of the exact mechanisms our finding that the overexpression of a talin head-gfp construct can suppress both the delayed migration and the reduced release of integrins at the rear in calpb <dig> border cells is intriguing, especially because only the functionally competent talin head domain was effective, the mutant variant that is unable to bind integrins had no effect. thus calpain b action and the activation of integrins by the active talin head domains are functionally related events. based on circumstantial evidence and analogies with the cell line experiments  <cit>  it is tempting to speculate that calpb generates talin heads that activate integrin clustering, and at the same time calpb weakens the connection between integrin and the extracellular matrix at the trailing end of the cells by cleaving additional protein substrates  <cit> . in these ways calpain b may contribute to the tension generation and the ripping off of the integrins at the rear of the border cells and acts as a regulator of cell migration in the drosophila ovaries.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated at the organism level that the canonical calpains in drosophilacalpa and calpb, are dispensable for vital functions, but calpb has a modulator role in the regulation of cell migration: it fine-tunes the adhesion complexes in the border cells during their migration. it is interesting to note that among the  <dig> mammalian calpain superfamily members, only capn <dig> and capn <dig> are involved in the regulation of cell motility  <cit> , but only capn <dig> can cleave talin in vivo. in an analogous way, only one of the two canonical drosophila calpain genes, calpb, is implicated in border cell migration, and may act via the digestion of talin. thus one of the important calpain functions was most probably conserved between mammals and drosophila.

cell motility is an essential factor governing development  <cit> . the uncovering of the role of calpb and the functionally competent talin head in border cell migration supports existing models and helps the better understanding of cell motility in general. besides cell adhesion, cell spreading and cell protrusion formation are important developmental processes in which the role of calpb remains to be elucidated.
