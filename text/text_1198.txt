BACKGROUND
leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease with a worldwide distribution . it is caused by more than  <dig> pathogenic serovars of the genus leptospira  <cit> . more than  <dig> mammals can be infected with leptospira spp. reservoir hosts include rodents, wild animals and domestic animals  . leptospira interrogans serovar bratislava has been associated with reproductive problems in pigs , which lead to economic loss  <cit> . in addition, pigs are considered to be reservoir hosts for serovars muenchen, pomona and tarassovi mitis and can also be infected with icterohaemorrhagiae from rats, canicola from dogs and hardjo from cattle .

in vietnam, leptospirosis was first identified in  <dig>  and the country is considered endemic with a peak during the rainy season . in  <dig>  a total of  <dig> rats were collected in the mekong delta in vietnam and of those,  <dig> % tested positive for leptospira serovars  <cit> . the identified serovars with the highest prevalence were rattus norvegicus , bandicota indica  and rattus tanezumi . it is assumed that rats are important reservoirs of the disease. in  <dig>  a study conducted in the mekong delta found that the seroprevalence in sows was 73% using a cut-off of 1: <dig>  the serovar with the highest prevalence was braitsalva . although leptospirosis is a notifiable disease in humans in vietnam, only a few cases have been reported to the centralized system. however, previous studies show that leptospirosis is a public health concern and is often responsible for 20% of acute fevers of unknown origin . a study conducted among healthy people in the mekong delta identified the following positive serovars: bataviae , panama , icterohaemorrhagiae  and australis   <cit> .

to our knowledge, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the sero-prevalence of leptospirosis in pigs in vietnam. therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the sero-prevalence and incidence of presumptive infective leptospira serovars in fattening pigs from  <dig> provinces in vietnam.

methods
blood samples from fattening pigs  were randomly collected from the jugular vein at slaughterhouses from  <dig> provinces  between january and early june  <dig>  the selected provinces were representative of the different ecological and climatic zones in vietnam. to evaluate the sero-prevalence of serovars in each province, the research team confirmed that all pigs sampled were raised in the respective province and not imported from other provinces.

all blood samples were immediately placed in cool boxes at slaughterhouses. sera were extracted after centrifugation and stored at −20 °c at local laboratories until they were transported to the national institute of veterinary research  in hanoi for analysis. the sample size was calculated based on 50% prevalence, a precision level of  <dig> and 95% confidence interval using stata. this indicated at least  <dig> samples per province were to be collected using multi-stage sampling . for each province, a total of  <dig> communes  were selected from  <dig> districts, based on the availability of pig slaughterhouses. within each commune, 15– <dig> samples were randomly collected from more than one slaughterhouse. however, we were not able to achieve the sample size in some communes due to lack of time and resources. additional information  was collected using a check-list.

the microscopic agglutination test  was used to identify the serogroups/serovars using two-fold serial dilutions of serum in testing, starting with 1: <dig> up to 1: <dig>  each serovar result was recorded as the highest dilution of the serum which showed at least 50% agglutination of live leptospires compared to the control sample. positive tests were defined as mat results ≥1: <dig> for at least one of the  <dig> serovars . a logistic regression model was constructed with the cluster effect  to evaluate the association between the sex and positivity when controlling for age . the logistic regression model was assessed for goodness-of-fit using the hosmer-lemeshow test  <cit> . the results were expressed as odds ratio  and 95% confidence interval . an alpha level of < <dig>  was set for statistical significance. all data were recorded in microsoft excel  <dig> and analyzed using stata . arcgis version  <dig> . <dig>  was used to generate the map .table  <dig> list of leptospira antigens used in the mat

RESULTS
we collected  <dig> sera samples from  <dig> provinces. however, seven samples from nghe an and three samples from son la showed hemolysis and, were discarded from the study. we detected reactions against nine different serovars. overall, the sero-prevalence was  <dig> % . yen chau district in son la province had the highest sero-prevalence. hanoi province  had the highest sero-prevalence whereas dak lak province  had the lowest sero-prevalence, but the differences were not statistically significant . the most frequently detected presumptive infective serogroup was tarassovi mitis , followed by australis , javanica , autumnalis  and grippotyphosa  using a cutoff titer of ≥1: <dig> . considering province and serovars autumnalis, australis, grippotyphosa, javanica and australis had the highest sero-prevalences in hanoi, son la, nghe an, dak lak and an giang, respectively . by using a low cutoff titer , the percentage of positive mat results for leptospira serovars was highest for tarassovi mitis  and australis  . a total of  <dig> samples were positive for two or more serovars: one sample with three serovars  and five samples with two serovars.table  <dig> sero-prevalence  with 95% ci for leptospira serovars in fattening pigs in vietnam using mat

discussion
this large, national study was conducted to assess the sero-prevalence of specific leptospira serovars in pigs across the country. overall, the sero-prevalence was lower than reported in previous studies  . this may be because our samples were collected during the dry and early wet seasons when sero-prevalence is likely to be lower than in the rainy season  <cit> . also, most of the previous studies were conducted in the mekong delta in southern vietnam that is relatively close to river areas, which might provide more opportunities to come into contact with contaminated water. in addition, samples were collected from slaughterhouses and so represent relatively young animals . one study suggested that older pigs were more likely to be exposed to leptospira  <cit> . moreover, animals sent for slaughter may be less likely to be visibly ill. we found that tarassovi mitis, australis, javanica, autumnalis and grippotyphosa had relatively high positive rates which were similar to those reported by the previous studies  <cit> . pigs are considered a reservoir for serovar tarassovi mitis which had the highest positive rate in our study, but one study showed that pomona had the highest rate  <cit> . another study found that bratislava had the highest sero-prevalence among sows in the mekong delta of vietnam, but it was not included in our analysis  <cit> . serovars australis, grippotyphosa, tarassovi mitis were detected in our study, and other studies also found these serovars in wild boars . in france, a re-emergence of brucellosis in outdoor pigs was linked to contact with wild boars  <cit> . it is possible that wild boars may play an important role in the transmission of leptospirosis to domesticated pigs in vietnam. in addition, we detected serovars javanica and icterohaemorrhagiae, implying that rats may have infected pigs  <cit> . other studies found that increased movement of wild animals during fall and early winter, associated with seeking shelter and food for the winter season, increases contact with domestic animals or organisms shed by wild animals  <cit> . further investigations are required to better understand the role of wildlife in transmission of leptospirosis in vietnam.

leptospirosis in humans is a notifiable disease in vietnam  that should be reported to the preventive medicine networks. however, due to lack of medical facilities and public awareness, few human cases have been reported in vietnam. only  <dig> cases were officially reported between  <dig> and  <dig> . surveys typically find higher levels; one study conducted in tien giang  found a sero-prevalence of  <dig> % among  <dig> and the most prevalent serovars were bataviae, panama, icterohaemorrhagiae and australis  <cit> . a serological study conducted among children in southern vietnam in  <dig> reported a sero-prevalence of  <dig> %  <cit> .

leptospirosis is considered an occupational risk for agriculture workers, mining workers, sewer maintenance workers, veterinarians and other individuals who are likely to come into contact with contaminated water or soil and infected animals  <cit> .

serovars autumnalis, australis, grippotyphosa and javanica have been recognized as major causes of human leptospirosis in asian countries, and were detected in our study. it is possible that the disease could be transmitted from pigs to humans  <cit> . in vietnam, small-scale pig production accounts for 80% of the total production, providing opportunities for transmission from pigs to farmers and their families  <cit> . in the united states of america, an epidemiological study showed that swine producers and slaughterhouse workers had relatively higher sero-prevalence of leptospirosis in comparison with other occupational groups  <cit> . in mexico, keeping domestic livestock  significantly increased the odds of disease in a rural community  <cit> . therefore, swine sero-prevalence may be useful as a surrogate marker of the human/animal leptospirosis incidence in vietnam. additional studies could evaluate the sero-prevalence in agricultural farmers and butchers as well as identifying the modes of transmission and potential risk factors through surveys of farm workers.

in particular, potential environmental risk factors  should be evaluated. previous studies showed a seasonal pattern and a positive association with the amount of rainfall  <cit> . in vietnam, there are two distinct seasons: dry  and wet . it could be possible that outbreaks of leptospirosis are more likely to occur during the wet season in vietnam. therefore, strengthened monitoring and surveillance systems are needed to better understand the epidemiology of leptospirosis and prevent or reduce infection in humans and animals.

CONCLUSIONS
leptospirosis in pigs may be a useful indicator of the human/animal burden in vietnam and a risk assessment tool. these studies are a way of providing evidence to veterinarians on diagnosis, vaccination and control of zoonotic pathogens. in addition, the presence of some of the identified serovars suggests that wildlife may play an important role in the transmission of leptospirosis to domesticated pigs in vietnam. further investigation is needed in each region into the possible role of different wildlife species or environmental conditions in contributing to infection.
