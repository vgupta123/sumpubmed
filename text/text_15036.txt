BACKGROUND
pluripotency is a unique feature of the cells found in early vertebrate embryos. pluripotent stem cells give rise to all cell types of the organism, including germ cells, but, unlike zygotes, they do not have the ability to give rise organisms autonomously  <cit> . the pluripotent phenotype is primarily determined by the expression of a set of pluripotency-associated transcription factors, as demonstrated by the induction of pluripotency in somatic cells transfected with four transcription factors to give rise to induced pluripotent stem  cells  <cit> . of these four transcription factors, oct3/ <dig>  and sox <dig> are known to be essential for maintaining pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . in contrast, the functions of klf <dig> and myc are dispensable for pluripotency, but primarily support self-renewal in the absence of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor  .

pluripotent stem cell populations have been definitively identified in mammalian embryos, but their presence in other vertebrate embryos remains unclear, with no pluripotent stem cell lines yet isolated from other taxa. frog animal cap cells behave similarly to pluripotent cells, but have never been shown to yield stem cells capable of propagating in vitro  <cit> . the absence of pluripotent stem cells is evident in ascidian embryos, since blastomeres exhibit mosaic behavior upon artificial separation  <cit> . likewise there is no evidence of pluripotent stem cells in well studied invertebrates, including fly and nematode. it therefore seems that the presence of a pluripotent stem cell population in the early embryo is a novelty exclusive to higher vertebrates.

addressing the evolutionary origins of transcription factor functions coupled with pluripotency is an interesting challenge, since it may provide insights into the origins of the pluripotency-associated transcription factor network. oct3/ <dig> belongs to the pou family and its evolutionary history has been addressed in several studies . the pou family of transcription factors are categorized into  <dig> classes and oct3/ <dig>  is a member of class v. although homologs of the other classes of pou family members can be found in the genomes of invertebrates, such as caenorabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster, there is no class v pou family member in any invertebrate genome studied to date, strongly suggesting that oct3/ <dig> is a genetic novelty in the vertebrate genome. in fish genomes, pou <dig>  is the evolutionarily oldest member of the class v pou family, but is not syntenic with oct3/ <dig> in mammals, and the functional complementation assays using fish pou <dig> in mouse es cells revealed only a weak ability to substitute for the function of oct3/ <dig> in supporting pluripotency. in the case of amphibian, there are three class v pou family members in the genome of xenopus tropicalis and these are found in tandem at a region syntenic with the pou <dig> locus in the fish genome. one of these, xlpou <dig>  is known to rescue oct3/ <dig> function, providing a signature of molecular evolution. monotreme oct3/ <dig> is a true ortholog that shares conserved synteny with other mammalian oct3/ <dig> genes, and functions to replace native oct3/ <dig> in mouse es cells, although the homology of its pou domain at the amino acid level in comparison to the mouse ortholog is not markedly different from its homology to the pou domain of zebrafish pou <dig>  interestingly, the monotreme genome also possesses the pou <dig> ortholog with conserved synteny, indicating that oct3/ <dig> and pou <dig> are paralogous. recently, it was suggested that a lizard genome may include an ortholog of oct3/ <dig> in a conserved syntenic position, but to date no functional analysis has been reported. the above observations indicate that oct3/ <dig> is a relatively recent evolutionary acquisition whose ancestor evolved in vertebrates as pou <dig>  and subsequently underwent a duplication to generate oct3/ <dig> as a new class v pou family member.

sox <dig> belongs to the sry-related high mobility group -box  family of transcription factors, whose members are characterized by a conserved hmg box dna binding domain related to the mammalian testis determining factor sry. members of the sox family bind to consensus dna sequences and act as either transcriptional activators or repressors  <cit> . in the mouse genome, there are  <dig> members of the sox family categorized into  <dig> groups. sox <dig> belongs to group b <dig>  which has two other members, sox <dig> and sox <dig>  the group b <dig> sox family is well conserved and has been identified in virtually all multi-cellular vertebrate and invertebrate animals, where they share conserved functions in neural development. in pluripotent stem cells, it is known that sox <dig> interacts with oct3/ <dig> to activate the transcription of target genes  <cit> . when and how sox <dig> acquired its function as a partner of oct3/ <dig> is an interesting but as yet unanswered question, although it has been suggested that this function is unique to group b <dig> sox family members. interestingly, it has been shown that in drosophila the group b protein dichaete interacts with the class iii pou protein vvl during neural development and in this role the mouse sox <dig> gene is able to functionally substitute for the fly protein  <cit> , suggesting that sox-pou interactions are ancient.

in the present study, we sought to reveal the molecular basis of the function of sox <dig> in pluripotent stem cells and shed light on its evolutionary origins. we employed a functional complementation assay in mouse es cells in which endogenous sox <dig> alleles were disrupted by gene targeting, while a tetracycline-regulatable sox <dig> transgene supports pluripotency  <cit> . we tested mouse sox family members from different groups along with group b <dig> sox family members from various organisms for their ability to substitute for mouse sox <dig> in maintaining pluripotency. we find that a single evolutionarily-conserved amino acid is important for the function of soxb <dig> proteins in maintaining mouse es cell self-renewal. finally, we report that the drosophila soxneuro protein can substitute for the functions of mouse sox <dig> required to maintain pluripotency.

RESULTS
sox <dig>  sox <dig>  and sox <dig> can replace the function of sox <dig> in mouse es cells
the mouse genome contains  <dig> sox family members, which are divided into eight groups based on the amino acid sequence of the conserved hmg-box  <cit>  . we selected one to three members from each group except group a, which contains sry as its sole member. the full set of open reading frames encoding the sox family members were isolated from mouse cdna pools or fantom cdna clones, and subcloned into the piggybac  expression vector ppbcag-cha-ib . their functions were first tested by reporter assays in hela cells. either the recognition site shared by sox family members  or a mutated version  were placed as  <dig> tandemly arranged copies upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase  minimal promoter driving expression of a luciferase reporter gene. we separately co-transfected hela cells with one of these reporters along with a sox gene expression vector and determined the ratio of sox to sac reporter activities in the presence of  <dig> different sox proteins. from these assays we confirmed that sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  and sox <dig> act as transcriptional repressors, since they repress the expression of the sox reporter. as previously reported, the remaining sox factors function as activators  <cit>  , confirming the validity of our sox expression vectors.fig.  <dig> sox <dig> rescue ability of mouse sox factors. a reporter gene assays of mouse sox factors. the ability to activate or repress the promoter activity via consensus sox binding motifs was assayed and the relative activities are indicated as ‘fold activation’ on the log scale. a value under  <dig>  indicates that the factor functions as a transcriptional repressor. each assay represents the mean of  <dig> replicates, error bars mean standard deviations. b cartoon of sox <dig> rescue experiments. 2ts22c es cells were transfected with an expression vector containing a mouse sox factor followed by culture without tetracycline  in fcs-medium to give a pool of transfectants without sox <dig>  transfectants were serially passaged in ksr-medium with tc at a density 3x103/well, and evaluated for their ability to form stem cell colonies. numbers 1– <dig> indicate the time points of the evaluation demonstrated in columns 1– <dig> of c. c sox <dig> rescue ability. the numbers of primary colonies and standard deviation obtained with each sox gene are indicated under the gene symbol. column <dig> shows colonies of primary transfectants grown without tc. column  <dig> shows secondary colonies grown in the presence of tc. stem cell colonies were recognized their tightly packed morpohology. column  <dig> shows colonies at passage  <dig> in the presence of tc if they yielded stem cell colonies at this stage. stem cell colony formation at this stage indicates rescue of sox2-null es cells. d immunostaining of rescued es cells. rescued es cells at passage  <dig> in the presence of tc were stained for sox <dig>  oct3/ <dig>  nanog and klf <dig>  the absence of sox <dig> staining with rabbit anti-sox <dig> polyclonal antibody in sox <dig>  sox <dig> and sox <dig> transfectants confirmed rescue. 2ts22c es cells cultured with or without tc for 4 days are shown as positive and negative controls, respectively



the sox expression vectors were then introduced into 2ts22c mouse es cells, these lack endogenous sox <dig> and are maintained by transgenic sox <dig> expression regulated by the tet-off system  <cit> . these es cells maintain self-renewal in the absence of tetracycline  but cease self-renewal and undergo differentiation to trophectoderm upon addition of tc. we introduced the sox expression vectors using the piggybac system, that results in efficient integration of transgenes into the mouse genome  <cit> , and individual lines were cultured with or without tc. if an introduced sox family member is capable of replacing the function of sox <dig>  the cells will be able to continue self-renewal over several passages in the presence of tc . in line with this expectation, we found that expression vectors containing sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  and sox <dig> yielded comparable numbers of stem cell colonies after culturing for seven days in the absence of tc . in contrast, both sox <dig> and sox <dig> evidently produced differentiated cell colonies . we found that sox <dig> expression resulted in many trophectoderm-like colonies, perhaps attributable to its strong function as a transcriptional repressor , which could compete with the function of sox <dig>  in contrast, sox <dig> induced parietal endoderm-like cells, in line with our recent report  <cit> . stable cell lines carrying each sox factor were dissociated and  <dig> ×  <dig> cells were seeded in the presence of tc, allowing selective propagation of the rescued stem cells. at the first passage, most of the sox vector containing cells showed obviously differentiated phenotypes as did the cells containing the empty vector control, whereas sox <dig> transfectants maintained an undifferentiated phenotype. at this period, only sox <dig> and sox <dig> supported stem cell colony formation as efficiently as sox <dig>  after the third passage in this condition, the rescuing ability of each sox factor was evaluated by stem cell colony formation. among the  <dig> sox factors tested, only three  showed the ability to restore es cell self-renewal although sox <dig> supported very few stem cell colonies at the first passage .

absence of sox <dig> in these rescued es cells was confirmed by immunostaining with anti-sox <dig> antibody  and the expression of sox <dig>  sox <dig> or sox <dig> from the transgenes were confirmed by immunostaining with the relevant specific sox antibody . we found that the rescued cells maintained expression of the pluripotency-associated transcription factors oct3/ <dig>  nanog and klf <dig> , indicating they behave as self-renewing es cells. these data indicate that the function of sox <dig> in supporting mouse es cell self-renewal is highly specific and shared with few other sox family proteins.

a single conserved amino acid in the hmg box is responsible for the unique function of sox2
sox <dig> and sox <dig> belong to group b <dig> and show high amino acid identity with sox <dig> in the hmg box. sox <dig> belongs to group g and it shows much lower sequence similarity to the sox <dig> hmg box than the sox <dig> and sox <dig> repressors that cannot replace sox <dig> function. we note that group g proteins are phylogenetically closest to group b  <cit>  , suggesting that unique amino acid conserved among groups b <dig> and g may confer their unique rescue function. the hmg box consists of  <dig> amino acids that form three α-helix structures mediating binding to the minor groove of target dna sequences  <cit> . many amino acids are conserved across all sox family members, distinguishing them from other hmg-box-containing transcription factors . sequence alignments also reveal amino acids shared by the members of particular groups that are not found in other groups. group b <dig> sox proteins share  <dig> unique amino acids that are rarely found in other groups: these are good candidates for conferring the unique es cell functions. to test the contribution of these amino acids to the sox <dig> es cell functions, we made a series of  <dig> mouse sox <dig> mutant proteins in which each unique amino acid was substituted for an amino acid shared by other sox groups : nine of the mutants changed a single amino acid and one changed two. all the mutant proteins showed comparable ability to activate the sox-dependent reporter in the hela cell assay, confirming that they retain the wild type ability to bind the target sequence and to activate transcription . when tested in 2ts22c es cells, nine of the  <dig> mutants were able to provide wild-type sox <dig> function and maintain self-renewal . in contrast, the one mutant protein that failed to rescue self-renewal carried a lysine to glutamate substitution at position  <dig> in the third helix of the hmg domain. sox <dig>  the group g protein that rescues sox <dig> self-renewal activity, also contains a lysine at position  <dig> . interestingly, this amino acid was previously reported to confer the differential activity of sox <dig> and sox <dig> in reprogramming somatic cells to ips cells  <cit> . as reported, we confirmed that replacement of e <dig> with k in sox <dig> conferred the ability to support self-renewal of sox2-null es cells . together, these data indicate that a unique amino acid shared by group b <dig> and group g proteins primarily confers the self-renewal function of sox family genes in es cells.fig.  <dig> rescue with mutated mouse sox <dig> proteins. a amino acid alignments of hmg-box from mouse sox family members. amino acids conserved in all sox factors are marked with blue, and amino acids unique to soxb <dig> are highlighted in red. b reporter gene assays of mutant proteins. the position and identity of amino acid substitutions in each line are shown on the left: all proteins show comparable ability to activate the sox <dig> reporter. each assay represents the mean of  <dig> replicates, error bars mean standard deviations. c rescue ability of altered sox <dig> proteins. the numbers of primary colonies and standard deviation obtained with each mutant sox <dig> protein are indicated under the id. colums represent:  <dig> – primary transfectants in the absence of tc.  <dig> – secondary colonies in the presence of tc.  <dig> – colonies at passage  <dig> in the presence of tc. only the m <dig>  mutant failed to provide wild-type sox <dig> function. d immunostaining of rescued es cells. rescued es cells at passage  <dig> in the presence of tc were stained for sox <dig>  oct3/ <dig>  nanog and klf <dig>  mutant forms of sox <dig> were detected by a goat polyclonal anti-sox <dig> antibody



self-renewal in mouse es cells is evolutionarily conserved in group b <dig> sox proteins
next we tested the functions of soxb <dig> homologs isolated from various animals. the vertebrate sox <dig> orthologs found at syntenic genomic locations share a highly conserved amino acid sequence along the entire molecule and retain the ability to replace the function of sox <dig> in mouse es cells . we tested invertebrate soxb <dig> homologs for their ability to replace the function of mouse sox <dig> in mouse es cells. we selected soxb <dig> proteins that showed the highest homology to the mouse sox <dig> hmg box from the genomes of amphioxus , an ascidian  and the fruitfly  . the ascidian and fluitfly soxb homologs we chose were annotated as ci-soxb <dig> and soxneuro , respectively. these soxb <dig> homologs share conservation only within the hmg box, and show no significant sequence homology in other coding regions . a phylogenetic analysis with amino acid sequences from the hmg domains confirmed these proteins were correctly related . we isolated the sequence for the soxb <dig> homologs from their genomes by pcr and subcloned the coding sequence into the piggybac expression vector. all three of these soxb <dig> homologs showed the ability to activate the sox reporter in hela cells at levels comparable to mouse sox <dig> .fig.  <dig> rescue ability of invertebrate soxb homologs. a amino acid alignments of the hmg-box of mouse groupb <dig> family members and soxb homologs from amphioxus, ascidian  and fluitfly . non-homologous amino acids are highlighted in red, the  <dig> helices of the dna binding domain are indicated as yellow bars. b cartoon of soxb protein structures. all share a very similar  <dig> amino acid hmg-box but the n- and c-terminal regions vary in their length and degree of homology to sox <dig> . c a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of soxb homologs. d reporter gene assays with soxb homologs. relative activities are indicated as ‘fold activation’ on the log scale. each assay represents the mean of  <dig> replicates, error bars mean standard deviations. all factors show comparable ability to activate the sox <dig> reporter. e es cell rescue assays. the numbers of primary colonies and standard deviation obtained with each groupb sox protein are indicated under the id colums represent:  <dig> – primary transfectants in the absence of tc.  <dig> – secondary colonies in the presence of tc.  <dig> – colonies at passage  <dig> in the presence of tc. all sox factors assayed showed rescue ability. f immunostaining of the rescued es cells. sox <dig>  indicates staining with goat anti-sox <dig> antibody which shows weak cross-reactivity with soxb homologs, except for the fly soxn protein. sox <dig>  indicates staining with a mouse anti-sox <dig> monoclonal antibody specifically reactive with mouse sox <dig>  confirming the proper loss of mouse sox <dig> in the rescued es cells



we then assessed the ability of the three group b <dig> proteins to functionally substitute for mouse sox <dig> in es cells. we performed the rescue assay using 2tc22c es cells described above and found that amphioxus soxb <dig>  ascidian ci-soxb <dig> and fly soxn possess the ability to support self-renewal of sox2-null es cells . the immunostaining analysis of these es cells confirmed the maintenance of oct3/ <dig>  nanog and klf <dig> expression of with loss of endogenous mouse sox <dig> . therefore, the evolutionally-conserved function of the soxb <dig> homologs is sufficient to maintain mouse es cells self-renewal.

fly soxn maintains pluripotency of mouse es cells
these data indicate that, at least in culture, invertebrate soxb <dig> factors possess the ability to support self-renewal of mouse es cells. to confirm the ability of the invertebrate soxb <dig> to support pluripotency of mouse es cells in vivo we utilised an alternative strategy. 2cg <dig> es cells carry loxp sites in both endogenous sox <dig> alleles as well as the expression vectors of the floxed sox <dig>  dexamethasone-inducible cre recombinase  and dsred under the regulation of the constitutively-active cag promoter  <cit>  . 2cg2-derived es cells have a confirmed ability to contribute to chimeric embryos and we therefore used them as a host for further engineering to generate mouse sox2-null es cells rescued by drosophila soxn. we first replaced one of the endogenous floxed sox <dig> alleles by drosophila soxn without the loxp site using homologous recombination. then these es cells were cultured in the presence of dexamethasone to activate the cre recombinase activity for deletion of the remained floxed sox <dig> allele and the floxed sox <dig> transgene. the correct removal of these floxed regions were confirmed by the pcr analysis of genomic dna and by the constitutive expression of the dsred transgene . as the result, we obtained mouse es cells that lack the expression of mouse sox <dig> but express drosophila soxn under the control of endogenous mouse sox <dig> regulatory sequences.fig.  <dig> mouse es cells maintained by drosophila soxn retain pluripotency. a a strategy to eatablish mouse es cells maintained by drosophila soxn. 2cg <dig> es cells were engineered according to the steps shown. the resulting es cells, designated hae es cells, express drosophila soxn under the regulation of the endogenous sox <dig> promoter. b immunostaining of hae es cells. in the column of αsox <dig>  d and m indicate the staining with anti-soxn antisera and mouse anti-sox <dig> monoclonal antibody, respectively. hae es cells express drosophila soxn but not mouse sox <dig>  nuclear signals indicate the antibody staining whereas the cytoplasmic fluorescence signals were derived from dsred. c chimeric embryos generated by injection of hae es cells expressing dsred  with the negative control 



these es cells, designated as hae es cells, grow normally and maintain the expression of oct3/ <dig> . we confirmed the presence of soxn and absence of sox <dig> by immunostaining with specific antibodies . when we injected these cells into blastocysts followed by uterine transfer to pseudo-pregnant females, we obtained chimeric embryos with obvious systemic distribution of dsred-positive cells . these results indicate that hae es cells retain pluripotency and are able to contribute to many lineages in the developing mouse embryo.

discussion
tissue-specific transcription factors act as the primary determinants of cell phenotypes in multi-cellular organisms. genetic evidence from model organisms suggests that multiple transcription factors cooperate through direct and indirect interactions to determine a single phenotype. several evolutionary novelties arose during the evolution of animals to generate the complex cellular architectures that characterize these organisms. such events were presumably coupled with the evolution of new transcription factor functions. the presence of a pluripotent stem cell population during early developmental stages is a unique feature of higher vertebrates that facilitates flexible developmental processes. we and others previously showed that the pou5f <dig> gene encoding oct3/ <dig>  one of the factors essential for conferring the pluripotent phenotype, may have co-evolved with the acquisition of a pluripotent cell population during vertebrate evolution . in contrast, in the case of its partner sox <dig>  not only do all vertebrates possess sox <dig> orthologs, but soxb <dig> genes sharing high sequence homology in the hmg box dna binding domain are found across all metazoan genomes, indicating an very early origin during animal evolution  <cit> . in the present study we show that invertebrate soxb <dig> homologs possess the ability to functionally substitute for sox <dig> and support the self-renewing state in mouse es cells, indicating that the unique function of sox <dig> in pluripotent stem cells is based on a conserved function of metazoan soxb <dig> proteins.

we identified a single amino acid, k <dig> positioned in the third α-helix of the dna binding domain, is responsible for conferring the unique function of sox <dig> in supporting pluripotency, raising questions about the role of this amino acid. interestingly, a previous report indicated that this amino acid is positioned in the interaction surface with oct3/ <dig> in ternary sox-oct complex formed on the utf <dig> enhancer  <cit> . that study also showed that two amino acid substitutions, including k57e, abolished the interaction with oct3/ <dig>  which agrees well with our finding that mutated sox <dig> proteins carrying the k57e substitution were no longer able to maintain pluripotency. interestingly, this unique amino acid is conserved in all group b sox family members, in mouse group g proteins and in the invertebrate soxb proteins we assayed. the evidence that sox <dig> is able to replace the function of sox <dig> supports the importance of this amino acid. moreover, as reported previously, the introduction of this amino acid to sox <dig> conferrs the ability to functionally substitute for sox <dig> in ips cell assays  <cit> , supporting the view that this amino acid, at least in part, is able to confer unique pluripotency functions of sox <dig>  clearly k <dig> is not a sufficient for sox2-specific pluripotency functions in es cells: for example, the group b <dig> proteins sox <dig> and sox <dig> also possess this amino acid but do not support self-renewal of sox2-null es cells. however, this is not surprising since these two proteins are known transcriptional repressors  <cit> , which we confirmed in our hela cell reporter assay. in contrast, all three invertebrate group b <dig> proteins we tested act as transcriptional activators in the same assay. these data suggested that the hmg-box with k <dig> and a transactivation domain are minimal requirements for sox <dig> activity supporting pluripotency. we previously reported the failure of hydra soxb to replace the function of sox <dig>  which could be due to the lack of proper transactivation domain that can act in mouse es cells since it also possess k <dig>  <cit> .

the functional conservation of soxb proteins in supporting es cell self-renewal and pluripotency is remarkable but not unique, with several reports of conserved function between mouse and fly now published. in a famous example, expression of the mouse pax <dig> gene can induce the formation of ectopic eye-like structures, mimicking the phenotypes elicited by the fly homolog eyeless  <cit> . the mutant phenotype of drosophila tinman was partially rescued by the transgenic expression of a mouse homologue nkx <dig>   <cit> . in the case of sox <dig>  we have shown that mouse sox <dig> transgenes can rescue aspects of neural development in dichaete null mutants  <cit> . however, in all these cases the functional conservation is manifest in homologous developmental processes: pax <dig> and eyeless normally function during eye development, nkx <dig>  and tinman participate in heart development, and both sox <dig> and dichaete have well documented roles in neural development. in contrast, here we show that drosophila soxn can replace sox <dig> function in pluripotent stem cells, for which there is no homologous cells or tissues in drosophila. to our knowledge a comparable case has only been reported with the mouse groupe sox gene sox <dig> and its role in neural crest development. in this case the mouse gene was replaced by the drosophila group e gene sox100b and, as we find here, although the fly lacks any conterpart to the vertebrate neural crest, the fly gene is able to provide substantial function in the absence of sox <dig>  <cit> . we believe these cases provide evidence that supports the idea that conserved functions of homologous genes can be integrated into new functions acquired during evolution that generate biological novelty.

how was the conserved sox <dig> function integrated into the pluripotency-associated transcription factor network? previous work showed that the expression of sox <dig> in es cells is supported by the es-specific enhancers. srr <dig> and srr <dig>  located at the 5′ and 3′ proximal regions of sox <dig>  were first identified  <cit> . srr1/n- <dig> is regulated by oct3/ <dig>  <cit>  and srr <dig> is activated by oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> in es cells  <cit> . comparative genome analysis of human, mouse and chicken sox <dig> orthologs revealed several conserved elements that possess this enhancer activity  <cit> . of these, srr <dig> is conserved in chicken but not in xenopus and zebrafish, suggesting its evolutionally new origin  <cit> . in addition, the recent reports demonstrated that the distal super-enhancer element possesses higher contribution to the transcriptional activation of sox <dig> in es cells although the evolutional origin of this element has not been characterized  <cit> . we consider that the acquisition of novel regulatory elements would be necessary since sox <dig> has evolutionarily conserved functions essential for neural development that restrict the flexibility to acquire new functions by modifying the protein sequence. interestingly, sox <dig> function is also important for self-renewal of mouse trophoblast stem  cells. we previously reported that sox <dig> has an alternative partner, tfap2c rather than oct3/ <dig>  and regulates different sets of target genes in es and ts cells  <cit> . since the trophectoderm lineage gives rise to the placenta, which is an obvious evolutional novelty acquired by eutherians, it will be of interest to dissect the function of sox <dig> in mouse ts cells using a approaches similar to those described here. such an analysis should provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms used during evolution to generate new functions for tissue-specific transcription factors and regulatory networks without increasing the number of genes in the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that the function of sox <dig> to maintain self-renewal of mouse es cells is specifically shared by group b <dig> of sox-family members. the invertebrate soxb <dig> members also possess this activity although they lack pluripotent stem cell population in developmental process, indicating that the function of soxb <dig> factor in pluripotent stem cells is a co-optional use of the evolutionally-conserved function.
