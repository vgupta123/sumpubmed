BACKGROUND
testudo graeca linnaeus  <dig>  or the spur-thighed tortoise, is an endangered species with a broad distribution range. it can be found in northern africa , the middle east , europe , and in asia . surprisingly, t. graeca is absent from egypt  <cit> . speciation and subspeciation in the genus testudo are still highly debated, and are notoriously complicated in testudo graeca. four subspecies have been recognized based upon morphology  <cit>  and are generally accepted, but many more have  been postulated . the latest revision of t. graeca systematics now includes  <dig> subspecies  <cit> : t. g. graeca linnaeus  <dig>  t. g. anamurensis weissinger  <dig>  t. g. antakyensis perälä  <dig>  t. g. armeniaca chkhikvadze & bakradze  <dig>  t. g. buxtoni boulanger  <dig>  t. g. cyrenaica pieh & perälä  <dig>  t. g. floweri bodenheimer  <dig>  t. g. ibera pallas  <dig>  t. g. nabeulensis highfield  <dig>  t. g. nikolskii chkhikvadze &bakradze  <dig>  t. g. perses perälä  <dig>  t. g. soussensis pieh  <dig>  t. g. terrestris forskål  <dig>  and t. g. zarudnyi nikolsky  <dig>  an overview of testudo graeca taxonomy is also available from the embl reptile database  <cit> . however, many novel descriptions have not been extended with population research or dna analysis, and thus the contribution to the classification of t. graeca remains unclear. two dwarf forms of t. graeca that developed in north africa have been described as a new species or even another genus: testudo flavominimaralis and furculachelys nabeulensis  <cit> . a rather large, highly domed form, originally named testudo whitei bennett,  <dig>  was moved into a new genus: furculachelys whitei  <cit> . this latter classification could not be confirmed by mitochondrial dna analysis  <cit> .

of the generally accepted subspecies, t. g. graeca of northern africa, t. g. ibera from the republic of georgia, bulgaria, north-eastern greece, turkey , iran, and northern iraq, and t. g. terrestris from southern turkey, syria, lebanon, jordan and israel, are the best described. the fourth subspecies, t. g. zarudnyi, is restricted to central and eastern iran and afghanistan, while t. g. nikolskii was reported to inhabit dry subtropic ecosystems along the north eastern black sea coast  <cit> . t. g. graeca has been introduced in recent times in southern spain and on the spanish island of mallorca . a morphological study suggested that the first three subspecies should be elevated to full species level  <cit> . furthermore, it was recently hypothesized based on genetic analysis that t. graeca of western morocco constitutes a separate subspecies  <cit> , provisionally named testudo graeca whitei. morphologically it was assigned full species status in an earlier study  <cit> . t. graeca shows variable colouring and patterning, which are greatly influenced by environmental factors and make subspecies identification difficult  <cit> , especially in captive animals of unknown provenance. dna analysis could also be helpful in subspecies determination  <cit> .

t. graeca numbers are steadily declining in the wild, partly due to agricultural developments and partly because the species is one of the most popular tortoises on the pet market, although its protected status and associated regulations have lessened much of the trade. for example export from morocco has been illegal since  <dig>  and import into the european community has been forbidden since  <dig>  because the systematics of the species complex is unclear, and the genetics of wild t. graeca populations has not been investigated, conservation and reintroduction programs are difficult to establish. t. graeca can be bred in captivity, and captive offspring could thus be used to replace wild populations .

using samples obtained from  <dig> testudo graeca, fragments of the mitochondrial  12s rrna gene and d-loop sequence were analysed to estimate haplotype diversity and genetic distances in this tortoise complex. the 12s rrna gene has previously been used to examine genetic variation in t. graeca from morocco and from spain  <cit> . in this study, three 12s rrna gene haplotypes were found in  <dig> tortoises from six locations in these countries. the mt 12s rrna gene was also used to elucidate phylogenetic relationships in the genus testudo  <cit> . in the latter study a total of ten 12s haplotypes were detected in  <dig> t. graeca specimens originating from  <dig> locations in africa and asia.

RESULTS
mitochondrial haplotype variation in testudo graeca
the 12s rrna fragment amplified was 393– <dig> nucleotides in length in our testudo graeca data set, and  <dig> positions were variable . a total of fourteen mt 12s haplotypes were observed in  <dig> unrelated individuals , and six haplotypes were seen only once . five of these haplotypes differed by a single nt change from more frequent haplotypes; one had a single nt deletion. the single nt differences cannot easily be attributed to pcr artifacts, as the analysis was done by direct sequencing of pcr fragments. the d-loop fragment amplified was 410– <dig> nucleotides in length in the twenty-two selected t. graeca, and  <dig> positions were variable . a total of  <dig> mt d-loop haplotypes were observed in  <dig> t. graeca , of which  <dig> were seen only once. four of these differed by a single nt change from other, more frequent haplotypes, while one had a single nt insertion, and one differed by  <dig> nt from the nearest haplotype. the combined data set contained  <dig> different mt haplotypes.

phylogenetic reconstitutions
the 12s rrna gene data set consisted of  <dig> total characters of which  <dig> were constant and  <dig> were parsimony informative. the d-loop data set consisted of  <dig> total characters of which  <dig> were constant and  <dig> were parsimony informative. both data sets were analysed separately, as well as combined, where the 3'end of the 12s sequence was joined to the 5'end of the d-loop sequence . analyses of both fragments resulted in a comparable clustering of haplotypes . only the analysis of the combined data set will be discussed here. two main clusters, present in both the ml  and nj  trees, each supported by bootstrap values of  <dig> in the nj tree, consisted of t. graeca from morocco, tunisia and algeria , and t. graeca from israel, lebanon, and turkey , respectively. four t. g. graeca subclades are detected with both ml and nj methods, all four receive high support  with the nj method. these lineages could represent proposed subspecies, but unfortunately detailed descriptions or geographic origins of the animals sequenced were frequently lacking. the most divergent subclade  corresponds with the haplotype from t. g. whitei  <cit>  and to the west moroccan haplotype of Álvarez et al.  <cit> . within t. g. terrestris / ibera no subclades could be confidently resolved. one wild-caught animal described as t. graeca nikolskii did harbour 12s haplotype tg <dig> , which is common in t. g. ibera. in three animals described as putative t. graeca anamurensis, three different 12s haplotypes were found: tg <dig> , tg <dig>  and tg <dig> . tg <dig>  is the common haplotype of t. g. terrestris, while tg <dig>  is encountered in animals found north of tg <dig> , which are described as t. g. ibera. most likely, two of these three animals are actually terrestris or ibera, also because their geographic origins are unknown. since t. graeca anamurensis has a limited distribution in the south of turkey, the unique haplotype tg <dig>   could eventually belong to this putative subspecies. to confirm this finding, additional wild-caught animals should be analysed. it is possible that additional mt haplotypes are present in animals from the northeastern part of the range of t. graeca , but unfortunately no such samples were available.

nucleotide distances
p-distances were calculated to estimate the average amount of haplotype divergence within clades and between the five well-supported clades. the average distance for the whole data set was  <dig> , with the average p-distance between the tg6/ <dig> haplotypes being  <dig> . the four clades characterized by haplotypes tg <dig>  tg <dig>  tg <dig>  and tg4/ <dig>  showed less within-clade variation , with an overall average distance of  <dig> . the average p-distance between haplotypes tg6/ <dig> and the other haplotypes was  <dig> . so, the highest variation in this data set is found between haplotypes tg6/ <dig> versus all the other haplotypes, with a lower variation within the five supported clades.

dating of mitochondrial dna lineages
t. graeca 12s rrna gene sequences from different locations grouped together when compared to 12s fragments from other tortoise species, suggestive of a single species  <cit> . at least  <dig> closely related but distinct mitochondrial lineages are found in t. graeca over the main part of its distribution range, suggestive of a relatively recent, rapid radiation of mitochondrial haplotypes in this species. earlier, depending on the 12s rrna substitution rate, we have calculated the divergence of t. g. graeca and t. g. ibera to occur between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million years ago  <cit> . based upon fossil evidence, mlynarski  <cit>  dates the emergence of t. cf. graeca to the early pleistocene, with the modern subspecies arising in the holocene. the mitochondrial dna data agree with a recent origin of t. graeca mt lineages . although the exact dating of lineage separation depends upon the  substitution rate of tortoise mitochondrial dna, the foundation of the modern lineages is most likely in the pleistocene . especially the very clear separation of t. g. graeca and t. g. ibera is compatible with an earlier origin of these subspecies than the holocene.

mtdna variation in t. graeca is rather large compared with the related species t. hermanni, probably because no losses occurred due to pleistocene ice age selection as a consequence of the geographic distribution of t. graeca compared with that of the european t. hermanni  <cit> . this variety in mitochondrial lineages in both t. g. graeca and t. g. ibera, although not representing subspecies per se, could be at the bottom of the confusing taxonomy of t. graeca. the mtdna variation observed corresponds with ongoing evolution, and is most likely accompanied by nuclear gene evolution or allele selection that could result in subtle morphological changes, especially when there is simultaneous pressure by environmental conditions.

it is interesting to note that t. graeca 12s fragment is somewhat less variable than the d-loop fragment analysed, a finding compatible with the situation in mammals, where rrna genes evolve slower than synonymous sites and the variable parts of the d-loop  <cit> . also, strong rate variability among mammalian species was detected for the d-loop region  <cit> , making this region less suitable for interspecies comparisons. the average amount of nucleotide substitutions between the t. g. graeca and t. g. ibera haplotype sets is  <dig>  subst/site for the 12s gene, and  <dig>  subst/site for the d-loop fragment.

in testudines, the overall mtdna sequence divergence rate has been estimated at  <dig> – <dig> % per million years  <cit> . others, however, did not find this  <dig> – <dig> × reduced rate for the 12s rrna gene in turtles  <cit>  and other reptiles  <cit> . palkovacs et al.  <cit>  detected an accelerated rate in malagasy pyxis, which they attributed to small body size and a short generation time in this species. in contrast, mammalian body size, generation time, and metabolic rate were not found to influence "taxon specific" mtdna evolutionary rates  <cit> . if we assume that the divergence of t. g. graeca and t. g. ibera occurred approximately in the middle of the pleistocene , the nucleotide substitution rate in t. graeca is estimated to be around  <dig> % per million years for the 12s gene, and  <dig>  % per million years for the d-loop fragment . if we assume the time point of divergence to be earlier , substitution rates decrease to  <dig> % per million years for the 12s gene, and  <dig>  % per million years for the d-loop fragment .

some authors  have proposed to elevate t. g. graeca and t. g. ibera to full species status . full species status is compatible with our mtdna data, and would certainly simplify t. graeca taxonomy. full species status would also be compatible with geography, t. graeca being confined to north africa, and t. ibera to the remaining regions in europe, the middle east and countries belonging to the former soviet union, with egypt serving as a corridor where neither t. graeca nor t. ibera is found. however, as the evolutionary history of a species can be confused by hybridisation, introgression, and incomplete lineage sorting  <cit> , analysis of nuclear markers would be advisable before full-species status can be reached.

CONCLUSIONS
based upon fragments of the mitochondrial 12s rrna gene and a d-loop fragment,  <dig> different haplotypes were detected in animals of the tortoise species testudo graeca obtained from several locations in north africa, the middle east and turkey. phylogenetic analysis suggested a clear separation between the recognized subspecies t. g. graeca and t. g. ibera, which a calculated divergence time in the early or middle pleistocene. many other putative subspecies were not clearly recognizable from their mt haplotypes, and clustered either with t. g. graeca or t. g. ibera haplotypes. awaiting analysis of nuclear markers, we propose full species status for t. g. graeca  and t. g. ibera , based upon their divergent mtdna lineages, with subspecies to be defined.
