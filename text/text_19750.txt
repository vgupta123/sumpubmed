BACKGROUND
cardiac autonomous activity originates in the sinoatrial node  where primary pacemaker cells generate spontaneous rhythmic action potentials that trigger heart muscle contraction. generation of rhythmic action potentials in the heart involves several channel proteins including t- and l-type ca2+ channels, a k+ channel and a pacemaker channel  <cit> . activation of t- and l-type ca2+ channels results in depolarization, followed by repolarization of the membrane potential due to opening of k+ channels. near the k+ equilibrium potential pacemaker channels open and give way to an inward na+ current. subsequent membrane depolarization towards the threshold voltage induces a new action potential. this pacemaker current, also termed ih or if, is an essential component of cardiac automaticity  <cit> .

hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated  channels are the molecular basis of if  <cit> . in mammals four hcn channel subunits  with different biophysical properties and expression patterns have been identified  <cit> . in the murine san the hcn <dig> isoform is the predominant subunit . although reports on expression of hcn <dig> –  <dig> in different species are not consistent, hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> have been identified consistently in murine cardiac tissue . transgenic studies in mice further emphasized the importance of hcn channels for cardiac function. knockout of hcn <dig> as well as a point mutation in the cyclic nucleotide-binding site of hcn <dig> caused embryonic lethality due to cardiac malfunction  <cit> . conditional knockout of hcn <dig> in adult mice was either lethal  <cit>  or induced cardiac arrhythmia with a reduction of if by about 75 % in the san  <cit> . knockout of hcn <dig> reduced sinoatrial if by approximately 30 %  <cit> , while a combined knockout of hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> caused a complete disruption of ventricular if  <cit> .

however, little is known about the link between cardiac functionality and hcn channel isoform expression on the cellular level. here we employed hl- <dig> cardiomyocytes, a murine atrial myocyte-based cell line that mimic properties of adult cardiomyocytes and express cardiac signature genes  <cit> . due to their ability to develop features similar to cardiac tissue, including spontaneous contractile activity  <cit> , hl- <dig> cells are a versatile cellular model system for investigating molecular components of cardiac physiology in vitro.

in this study we focused on expression profiles of hcn channel isoforms in hl- <dig> cells. differential expression of all four hcn isoform genes was examined via quantitative pcr. as an independent method, immunocytochemistry was used to analyze the presence of these proteins in hl- <dig> cells. notably, hcn channel isoforms were not detected in contracting hl- <dig> cells. however, our results suggest a direct correlation between hcn gene expression and hl- <dig> cell differentiation. thus hl- <dig> cells can serve as a model system for in vitro studies of cardiomyocyte development and differentiation.

methods
hl- <dig> cells
hl- <dig> cells were obtained from dr. w. c. claycomb  and were cultured as recommended  <cit> . briefly, cells were maintained in claycomb medium  supplemented with 10 % fbs , 100 μm noradrenaline , 2 mm l-glutamine , 300 μm ascorbic acid , and 100u/ml:100 μg/ml streptomycin:penicillin . cells were cultivated on dishes coated with  <dig>  % gelatin  and  <dig>  μg/ml fibronectin  at 37 °c, 5 % co <dig>  and 95 % relative humidity. for imaging, cells were cultivated either on pre-coated glass coverslips or on 35 mm cell culture dishes with glass bottom .

rna preparation and cdna synthesis
total rna was isolated from hl- <dig> cells and mouse brain using the dna/rna/protein allprep® kit  according to the supplier's protocol. animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional protocols in compliance with national and international guidelines . rna samples were split for two independent first-strand cdna syntheses using oligo-dt primers  and moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase  according to the supplier’s protocol.

quantification of gene expression by real-time pcr
thermocycling was performed in a lightcycler  <dig>   using the quantitect sybr green pcr kit  according to the supplier’s protocol. gene-specific primers were purchased from mwg operon . specificity and efficiency of primers  were confirmed via blast analysis and pcr on cloned gene fragments. qpcr reactions were performed on 1 μl aliquots of first-strand cdna samples in a total volume of 20 μl. the gapdh primers were designed to bind in exons separated by an intron of 134 bp to check for genomic impurities. qpcr runs were concluded by generating a melting curve to confirm homogeneity of amplified fragments. results were analyzed using the ct method. gene expression levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene gapdh. data sets generated in the course of one experimental series were normalized to values at a specified culture density . samples were grouped according to visually determined culture densities: five groups were defined, i. e. with 1–20 %, 21–40 %, 41–60 %, 61–80 %, and 81–100 % cell density. for analysis, mean ± s.e.m. values were calculated.table  <dig> primer pairs for qpcr on hl- <dig> cell and mouse brain cdna

RESULTS
cardiac contraction strongly depends on consecutive activity of different voltage-dependent ion channel classes  <cit> . in the heart, hcn channels not only restore the resting membrane potential from hyperpolarized values but also contribute to a novel depolarization due to their pronounced na+ conductance. in this study we examined expression patterns of four hcn channel isoforms in hl- <dig> cells, both on the transcript and on the protein level.

gene expression of hcn channel isoforms in hl- <dig> cells
for investigation of hcn channel isoform gene expression, specific primers were designed to amplify defined hcn fragments. the specificity of these primers was confirmed on mouse brain cdna , where hcn <dig> -  <dig> isoforms are known to be expressed  <cit> , as well as on hl- <dig> cell-derived cdna . amplified fragments displayed expected sizes, i. e. 184 bp for hcn <dig>  149 bp for hcn <dig>  141 bp for hcn <dig>  153 bp for hcn <dig>  and 150 bp for gapdh. gene expression of hcn <dig> –  <dig> in confluent hl- <dig> cell culture was determined via qpcr and normalized to gapdh . while transcript levels of hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> were rather similar, hcn <dig> transcripts were almost twice as abundant as hcn <dig> or hcn <dig>  in this quantitative analysis only marginal amounts of hcn <dig> transcripts were detected.fig.  <dig> gene expression of hcn channel isoforms in mouse brain and hl- <dig> cells. pcr analysis of hcn <dig> –  <dig> and gapdh gene expression on mouse brain cdna  and hl- <dig> cell cdna . sizes of marker bands are indicated on the right. gene expression levels were determined via qpcr on cdna of confluent hl- <dig> cell cultures. transcript expression levels for hcn  <dig> –  <dig> genes normalized to gapdh are shown in . data points depict mean ± s.e.m.  and student's t test was performed 



hl- <dig> cells develop contractile activity at high culture densities, implicating cell confluency as an important factor of hl- <dig> cell differentiation. to examine whether the development of contractile hl- <dig> cell activity correlates with hcn gene expression, transcript levels of hcn <dig>  hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> were quantified at different hl- <dig> culture densities. the following cultivation strategies were applied:  cells were plated at different densities, and mrna was isolated after 4d in culture;  cells were plated at defined densities, and mrna was isolated after different cultivation times . samples were grouped according to their respective culture densities that were visually determined prior to mrna isolation. transcript expression was examined via qpcr and normalized to the housekeeping gene gapdh.

striking gene-specific changes in expression profiles were observed . expression of hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> increased with increasing culture density. for both genes the highest transcript levels were measured at about 60 % cell confluency. notably, in cultures reaching 100 % confluency hcn <dig> expression decreased almost to the starting level , whereas hcn <dig> levels remained elevated . in contrast to hcn <dig> and hcn <dig>  hcn <dig> expression was high at low cell confluency. with increasing culture density, however, hcn <dig> expression decreased almost linearly . gene expression profiles were similar when comparing data sets generated according to cultivation strategy  or  . based on these transcript expression profiles one might speculate that individual hcn isoforms play a role in hl- <dig> differentiation as well as in establishing hl- <dig> cell contractile activity. however, qpcr data was obtained from the entire cell culture samples not providing information on the individual cell level. therefore, we examined the distribution of hcn proteins via immunocytochemistry.fig.  <dig> expression of hcn genes in hl- <dig> cell samples obtained at different culture densities. gene expression levels were determined via qpcr on cdna from hl- <dig> cells propagated at different culture densities according to cultivation strategy . quantification of genes  is shown in relation to culture confluency . values for hcn <dig> , hcn <dig> , and hcn <dig>  were normalized to gapdh . samples were grouped according to visually determined culture densities. grey inlays denote conditions where hl- <dig> cells displayed strong contractile activity. data points depict mean ± s.e.m. and one-way anova was performed for each group  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; **f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; ***f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> )



analysis of hcn channel isoform expression in hl- <dig> cells
in order to gain insight into expression patterns of hcn proteins in individual hl- <dig> cells we performed a series of immunocytochemical stainings with hcn isoform-specific primary antibodies. expression of hcn <dig>  hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> was reliably detected , whereas detection of hcn <dig> proteins failed. hcn <dig>  hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> were primarily located at the plasma membrane . notably, only a fraction of hl- <dig> cells in culture expressed hcn channel proteins: we observed approximately 3 % hcn1-positive, 1 % hcn2-positive, and 10 % hcn4-positive cells in confluent hl- <dig> cell cultures . hcn <dig> expression was detected in single cells as well as in small cell clusters. expression of hcn <dig> was found mostly in single cells. in contrast, hcn4-expressing cells tended to form large cell clusters. co-immunostaining revealed co-expression of hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> in approximately  <dig>  % of cells , however, the majority of hcn <dig> and hcn4-positive cells expressed only one hcn isoform . co-immunolabeling of hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> showed that these proteins were expressed in different cells or cell clusters . similar expression patterns have been reported in vivo for these hcn isoforms  <cit> . our findings on cell specific and restricted expression of hcn channel proteins suggest that hl- <dig> cells in culture occur in various states, rather than being a homogeneous population of cells.fig.  <dig> expression of hcn channel isoforms in hl- <dig> cells. immunostaining of hcn <dig> , hcn <dig> , and hcn <dig>  in confluent hl- <dig> cell cultures was performed with hcn isoform-specific primary antibodies  followed by fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. hl- <dig> cells were double-immunostained for hcn <dig>  and hcn <dig>  and for hcn <dig>  and hcn <dig> ; merged images of double-immunostainings are shown in  and , respectively. some cells specifically stained for either isoform are indicated by arrowheads; co-immunolabeled cells are marked by asterisks. scale bars specify 20 μm



hcn isoform expression and cell contraction
to investigate whether contractile hl- <dig> cell activity can be attributed to the expression of hcn isoforms, spontaneously contractile cell clusters were microscopically identified on coverslips with integrated grid patterns. subsequently, samples were fixed and stained for hcn isoforms. images taken from live documentation and immunolabeling were superimposed and aligned based on the underlying grids . at high culture densities hl- <dig> cells tend to grow in overlapping layers instead of a confluent monolayer. superimposing live documentation images and maximal intensity projections occasionally suggested an overlap of hcn-expressing cells and spontaneously contracting areas . however, this overlay was completely due to the layered growth of hl- <dig> cell cultures, since spontaneously contracting cells did not express any of the investigated proteins . nevertheless, cell clusters displaying strong contractile activity were often found in the vicinity of large hcn4-expressing cell clusters .figure  <dig> expression of hcn isoforms in hl- <dig> cell cultures displaying contractile activity. contractile activity in confluent hl- <dig> cell cultures was documented  before samples were immunostained with specific primary antibodies  and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. images of hl- <dig> cell contraction and immunostainings were superimposed based on underlying grids . areas of contractile cell clusters are indicated by dotted lines. immunolabeling of hcn <dig> , hcn <dig> , and hcn <dig>  is depicted. arrowheads indicate some cells specifically stained for hcn isoforms. scale bars specify 20 μm



during propagation, hl- <dig> cells acquire strikingly different morphologies. heterogeneity is reflected both, on the phenotypic level, e. g., contractile and non-contractile cells, as well as on the molecular level as demonstrated by the highly diverse expression patterns of hcn channels.

discussion
in recent years, knowledge of the molecular components that are instrumental in cardiac physiology has expanded significantly. contribution of hcn channels to cardiac rhythmicity is well established and has been corroborated by several knockout studies  <cit> . however, only a few studies addressed the potential link between cardiac rhythmic activity and the expression of hcn channel isoforms on the cellular level. here we studied an in vitro cell system of cardiac origin, the hl- <dig> cell line, to examine their molecular repertoire of hcn channels.

the vertebrate heart is separated into distinct, functionally specialized segments that are essential for cardiac rhythmicity. expression of proteins in a developmentally specified manner is essential for cardiac function. since analysis of cardiac processes in vivo is limited, a number of studies have been initiated in cellular model systems, such as cardiomyocytes or cardiac cells derived from murine embryonic stem cells  . hl- <dig> cells are another versatile model for investigation of cardiac processes in vitro, due to their unique feature of retaining properties reminiscent of differentiated adult cardiomyocytes, like contractile activity, even during serial passaging  <cit> . furthermore, hl- <dig> cells have been shown to express several cardiac marker genes, e. g., hcn channel isoforms  <cit> .

in this study, differentiation of hl- <dig> cells under different cultivation conditions was assessed via the emergence of spontaneous contractile activity. we noticed a marked increase of hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> gene expression with rising culture density, that ceased with the appearance of strong contractile activity in the culture. in contrast, we observed that with increasing culture confluency, the amount of hcn <dig> transcripts decreased to approximately 40 % of the transcript level expressed at low confluency . in native cardiac tissue, hcn <dig> gene expression declines with increasing age of mice  <cit> , and the functional contribution of hcn <dig> to cardiac rhythmicity in vivo is successively reduced during the animal's development .

gene expression profiles can provide important information on constitutive or differential transcriptional activity in tissues. however, they do not provide conclusive information on the corresponding protein expression patterns. this has been emphasized previously for hcn channel expression in the heart, where transcript and protein expression levels are not consistent  <cit> . similar results were observed in this study . in hl- <dig> cells, hcn <dig> was the predominant isoform, followed by hcn <dig>  whereas hcn <dig> was the least expressed. remarkably, these results are analogous to reported expression patterns of hcn isoforms in the murine cardiac conduction system  <cit> . furthermore, the property of hcn4-positive cells to form cell clusters has also been found at the center of the rabbit san  <cit> , as well as in mesc-derived pacemaker cell clusters, expressing either hcn <dig> or hcn <dig>  <cit> .

hcn isoforms are expressed in a highly differential manner in the heart that correlates with cardiac physiology . designated expression is emphasized as an essential part of functional tissue differentiation as properties of hcn channels largely depend on subunit composition  <cit> . co-assembly of different hcn isoforms in heterologous expression systems as well as in cardiomyocytes, results in functional hcn channels with biophysical properties that differ from homomeric channels  <cit> . however, detailed studies addressing hcn isoform co-assembly in the heart are lacking. in this study, we observed co-expression of hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> in some hl- <dig> cells, similar to reports in mesc-derived pacemaker cells  <cit> . although we did not perform electrophysiological measurements, it can be hypothesized that co-assembly of hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> increases the functional repertoire of pacemaking channels in hl- <dig> cells.

even though hcn channels have been attributed distinct functions in cardiac rhythmicity, little is known about these aspects on the cellular level. expression of the hcn channel-based if current has been shown in mesc-derived contracting cells, where pharmacological blocking of if caused a reduction of the contraction frequency  <cit> . however, reports on hcn isoform expression in mesc-derived contracting cells are not consistent  <cit> . we found that contractile hl- <dig> cell clusters were devoid of hcn proteins, but cell clusters expressing hcn <dig> were frequently located in the vicinity of contracting cells. thus, the endogenous presence of hcn channels seems not to be required for hl- <dig> cells to develop contractile activity. nevertheless, hcn channel expression in neighboring cell clusters might contribute to signaling events that culminate in cell contraction of nearby clusters. this hypothesis is supported by recent findings showing that contractility of mesc-derived cell clusters relies on the expression of specific transcription factors, e. g., shox <dig> and gata <dig>  in adjacent, non-contractile cell clusters . notably, in mesc-derived model systems shox2-positive cell clusters express hcn <dig>  <cit> , and cgata6/mink-positive cells possess if currents  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the expression patterns of hcn channels were resolved in hl- <dig> cells, both on the transcript and on the protein level. notably, only a small fraction of cells in a confluent culture express these channels suggesting that hl- <dig> cells are present in a variety of molecular and functional states. whether hl- <dig> cell contraction relies on hcn channel expression in adjacent cells and/or which additional factors contribute to the generation of contractile activity, remains to be addressed. it will also be interesting to examine whether a direct correlation between hcn channel expression and differentiation into distinct cellular phenotypes can be revealed.
