BACKGROUND
apolipoprotein-e  is a ~ <dig> kda protein that plays important roles in lipid transport and neurobiology  <cit> . in humans, apoe exists as three major isoforms apoe <dig>  apoe <dig> and apoe <dig> which differ in their cys/arg composition at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  apoe <dig> contains cys <dig>  cys158; apoe <dig> contains cys <dig>  arg158; and apoe <dig> contains arg <dig>  arg <dig>  <cit> . apoe <dig> is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset alzheimer's disease  whereas apoe <dig> is associated with decreased ad risk  <cit> . apoe in the cns is primarily produced by astrocytes, although microglia and neurons may also contribute under certain circumstances  <cit> .

apoe participates in several biological processes that extend beyond lipid transport and include immunoregulation, oxidative stress, stabilization of neuronal microtubules, nerve regeneration, apoptosis and amyloid-beta  peptide clearance and degradation  <cit> . despite intense research into the diverse biological functions of apoe, the precise mechanism by which the apoe <dig> isoform increases ad risk remains to be fully elucidated. however, many differences between apoe <dig> and apoe <dig> structure and function have been reported that are potentially relevant to ad. these include: reduced lipid-binding capacity of apoe <dig> due to isoform-specific domain interactions  <cit> , lipidated apoe <dig> has a lower affinity for aβ  <cit> , apoe <dig> is less efficient at stabilizing microtubules  <cit> , apoe <dig> exhibits weaker antioxidant activity  <cit>  and apoe <dig> is structurally less stable  <cit>  when compared to apoe <dig>  it is also clear that the proteolytic fragmentation of apoe in the human brain is isoform-dependent  <cit> . in addition, a significant proportion of apoe <dig>  is present in plasma, csf and astrocyte conditioned media as a disulfide-linked homodimer and as an apoe-apoa-ii heterodimer  <cit> . this may be important as apoe <dig> lacks cys and cannot form disulphide-linked dimers. in vitro studies have shown that compared to apoe monomers, apoe dimers possess significantly altered functional properties in terms of their capacity to regulate cellular cholesterol efflux and to interact with aβ  <cit> . this further underscores the importance of probing for the possible occurrence of apoe dimers in the human brain. in the present study we demonstrate that disulphide-linked apoe homodimers and heterodimers are present in the human cortex and hippocampus. in addition, we show that apoe dimerisation was not affected by the presence of ad.

RESULTS
apoe <dig> forms disulfide-linked dimers in the human brain
it is established that apoe <dig> forms disulphide-linked homodimers and apoe3-apoa-ii heterodimers in human plasma and csf  <cit> . as apoe <dig> lacks cys it cannot form disulphide bonds. whether apoe <dig> exists in a dimeric state in human brain tissue is unknown and we therefore focused on this issue. western blot analysis of tbs-soluble brain homogenates derived from the hippocampus of a control apoe3/ <dig> subject indicated a clear apoe <dig> homodimer when the sample was run under non-reducing conditions . the homodimer was detected at ~ <dig> kda  which is consistent with previous data  <cit> . apoe contains a major cut site for thrombin in the linker region  <cit> . due to the high proteolytic specificity of thrombin  <cit> , it was used here to further confirm the identification of the ~ <dig> kda band as an apoe homodimer. the putative apoe <dig> homodimer was removed after incubation with thrombin, as predicted, further confirming that the ~ <dig> kda band is not likely to be due to non-specific binding of the antibody used.

incubation of the homogenate in the presence of heat-inactivated thrombin resulted in a partial loss of the apoe dimer which suggests that endogenous proteases may also degrade apoe . a band of relatively lower intensity was also observed at ~ <dig> kda in the non-incubated apoe <dig> control condition. this is consistent with the apoe-apoa-ii heterodimer previously detected in human plasma and csf  <cit> . a series of apoe fragments was also detected with a major band at ~ <dig> kda. this is in close agreement to our previous observations  <cit> .

additional hippocampal and frontal cortex homogenates from control apoe3/ <dig> donors were analysed and this revealed that the apoe <dig> homodimer was present in all samples and accounted for  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  of the total apoe present in the hippocampus and  <dig> % ±  <dig> %  of the total apoe present in the frontal cortex . although the percentage of apoe present as the homodimer was on average increased in the frontal cortex, this difference did not reach statistical significance. we also analysed frontal cortex and hippocampus derived from apoe3/ <dig> ad samples and found that apoe <dig> dimers were detected in all ad samples and were identical to those in the control samples . there was no significant difference regarding the proportion of apoe that was present in the dimerised form when frontal cortex from the two groups were compared .

we also used an additional rigorous extraction protocol employing extraction buffer that contained the detergent triton-x <dig>  this was done in order to maximise recovery of apoe that may be associated with tbs-insoluble material. both the control and ad samples were found to contain apoe homodimers when samples were extracted in detergent-containing buffer . these data are very similar to the results obtained with the tbs-soluble homogenates .

as predicted, apoe dimers were not detected in any of the  <dig> apoe4/ <dig> ad samples analyzed . analysis of heterozygous apoe3/ <dig> ad samples revealed a significant 61% reduction in the percentage of apoe <dig> present as homodimer as compared to apoe3/ <dig> homozygous ad samples . representative blots from heterozygous apoe3/ <dig> ad samples are shown .

apoe <dig> forms disulphide-linked dimers in human sk-n-sh neurons and rabbit brain
one potential issue that arises in the analysis of protein modifications in human post-mortem material is the potential for artifactual changes to be induced by post-mortem interval . even though clear ~ <dig> kda and ~ <dig> kda apoe dimers were detected in apoe <dig> ad homozygous samples with a post-mortem delay of as short as  <dig> h , we also probed for apoe dimers in human neuroblastoma cell lysates and freshly harvested rabbit brain. the human sk-n-sh neuroblastoma cell line expresses the apoe ε3/ε <dig> genotype  <cit>  and synthesizes large amounts of apoe under serum starved conditions  <cit> , whereas rabbits are one of the few non-human species known to contain an apoe cys <dig> residue  <cit> .

analysis of sk-n-sh cell lysates under non-reducing conditions revealed the presence of the ~ <dig> kda apoe homodimer and a more prominent  ~ <dig> kda heterodimer . since the ~ <dig> kda dimer could theoretically represent a disulphide-linked apoe n-terminal domain homodimer , we used a c-terminal specific monoclonal antibody in this experiment and the detection of the ~ <dig> kda band indicates an intact c-terminus. this rules out the presence of disulphide-linked n-terminal domain homodimer. the ~ <dig> kda band may represent an apoe3-apoa-ii heterodimer as has been previously described in human plasma and csf  <cit> .

in the analysis of rabbit frontal cortex, the brain was dissected and processed immediately at the time of death to eliminate post-mortem delay and all measures were taken to prevent serum and csf contamination . an apoe band at ~ <dig> kda was also detected in rabbit brain when samples were run in the non-reduced state , again indicating that apoe containing cys <dig> does form a homodimer in the brain.

to address the possibility that the observed apoe dimerisation may occur during tissue homogenization and processing for electrophoresis, freshly prepared rabbit brain and frozen human frontal cortex tissue  were homogenized in buffer containing the thiol trapping agent iodoacetamide. homogenization was also performed using a detergent-rich lysis buffer to delipidate apoe-containing lipoproteins and help prevent the possibility of dimers forming spontaneously on lipoprotein particles during homogenization and processing. the presence of  <dig> mm iodoacetamide did not result in a decrease in apoe homodimer levels in either rabbit or human brain tissue . the thiol-trapping efficiency of  <dig> mm iodoacetamide was confirmed by spectrophotometric analysis of the total thiol concentration of the homogenates using ellman's reagent ). the total thiol concentration was significantly reduced in both rabbit and human brain homogenates  treated with iodoacetamide . this data demonstrates that apoe dimers are not artificially formed during tissue homogenization and processing, and further indicates that apoe dimers are generated in the brain.

discussion
this study demonstrates for the first time that apoe <dig> disulphide-linked dimers are present in human frontal cortex and hippocampus. furthermore, strikingly similar dimers were also detected in human neuroblastoma cells expressing apoe <dig> and in freshly prepared rabbit brain. these data indicate that apoe <dig> dimerisation is a physiologically relevant process in the human brain; as it is in human csf and plasma  <cit> . the biological functions of these apoe dimers in the brain is not yet clear, however, several studies support the possibility that they may have distinct properties that differ from apoe monomer. previous studies have demonstrated that apoe <dig> homodimers and apoe3-apoa-ii heterodimers have diminished low-density lipoprotein receptor binding activity  in comparison to apoe <dig> monomer  <cit> . in vitro studies have shown that the apoe-apoa-ii dimer is more effective than apoe monomer in binding soluble aβ1- <dig> and inhibiting its internalisation by neurons  <cit> . in addition, a recent study has demonstrated that the apoe <dig> homodimer is more effective than monomeric apoe <dig> at enhancing abca1-dependent lipid efflux from neurons  <cit> .

based on these data, it seems possible that the reported physiological properties of apoe dimers may enhance some of the ad-protective functions attributed to apoe <dig>  for example, the role of apoe in aβ clearance and degradation  <cit>  may be facilitated by enhanced binding with aβ1- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the enhanced neuronal cholesterol efflux that is induced by apoe dimers as compared to monomers  <cit>  may be important considering that high levels of neuronal cholesterol can influence processing of the amyloid precursor protein and increase aβ production  <cit> . thus dimerisation may represent one mechanism by which apoe <dig> and apoe <dig> have a distinct ad-protective advantage over apoe <dig>  however, this feature alone is probably not the crucial regulator underlying apoe genotype-associated risk as the dimers were detectable at similar levels in apoe <dig> homozygous control and ad samples.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the presence of apoe <dig> dimers in the human brain represents a fundamental structural difference between apoe <dig> and apoe <dig>  a greater understanding of the biological consequences of this difference may shed light on the isoform-dependent influences of apoe on ad risk.
