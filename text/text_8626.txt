BACKGROUND
introns in protein-coding genes and pre-mrna splicing are ubiquitous in eukarya and, to a lesser extent, in bacteria. until  <dig>  pre-mrna splicing had not been reported in archaea. in  <dig>  we reported the first examples of archaeal pre-mrna splicing for homologs of the eukaryotic cbf <dig>  protein in aeropyrum pernix, sulfolobus solfataricus, and s. tokodaii . we found that the cleavage of the pre-mrna depends on the recognition of a bulge-helix-bulge -like structure in the precursor  <cit>  by the splicing endonuclease enda  <cit> . in archaea, pre-trna and pre-rrna splicings also depend on the same system . although most species from the orders desulfurococcales and sulfolobales have the  cbf <dig> intron, h. butylicus, p. occultum, p. fumarii, and i. islandicus in the order desulfurococcales do not contain the intron  <cit> . this observation suggested putative secondary loss of the intron. however, phylogenetic analysis of the cbf <dig> protein sequences did not resolve the relationships between species from different orders of crenarchaeota, likely due to the short sequence  studied in the analysis  <cit> .

in the present study, we determined a formerly undetermined region of cbf <dig> sequences from the previously characterized  <dig> species and new sequences from an additional  <dig> species. we studied  <dig> species, which were almost all the available species from type culture collections. we determined up to two-thirds of the coding region, corresponding to about  <dig> amino acid residues, and then examined the timing of the gain and the possible loss of the intron in the archaeal protein-coding gene. we found that the intron existed in the cbf <dig> gene in the common ancestor of the orders desulfurococcales and sulfolobales, and then the intron was lost in some lineages in the order desulfurococcales.

methods
strains and dna for pcr screening
most crenarchaeal strains were grown according to the conditions suggested by the japan collection of microorganisms   <cit> . some strains were purchased from the german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures . in most pcr reactions, the crude dna was prepared as described previously  <cit> . in the case of thermofilum pendens, the obtained dna was too dilute; thus, for pcr with degenerate primers at the initial screening, the dna was pre-amplified by using the illustra genomiphi dna amplification kit . the dna of 'caldococcus noboribetus' was kindly provided by dr. m. aoshima . the dna from aeropyrum pernix strains was prepared as previously described  <cit> . see , table  <dig> and  <dig>  for further information about the strains.

pcr screening of archaeal cbf <dig> genes
the typical reaction mixture for pcr  contained 1× reaction buffer ,  <dig>  mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate,  <dig>  μl of template, and  <dig>  units of extaq . at the first screening to obtain the gene fragment between gly <dig> and ile <dig>  with m <dig> sequencing primer  binding sites at both ends, we used a set of degenerate primers based on conserved regions among known crenarchaeal cbf <dig> sequences , and  <dig> μm p- <dig> ). for ignicoccus pacificus, staphylothermus hellenicus, pyrodictium brockii, 'caldococcus noboribetus', and ignisphaera aggregans,  <dig> μm p- <dig> was used as a forward primer instead of the combination of p- <dig> and p- <dig> to improve the amplification efficiency. in the case of pyrobaculum arsenaticum, p. islandicum, and p. organotrophum,  <dig> μm p- <dig>  specifically designed for the pyrobaculum species, was used as the forward primer. the pcr products were purified and sequenced as described previously  <cit> .

to obtain additional sequence information from the 3' region of the gene in the species described above as well as in the species that we previously studied  <cit> , we designed degenerate primers p- <dig> and p- <dig> with m <dig> sequencing primer binding sites and performed semi-nested pcr with two species-specific primers  and p-1609/p- <dig> . the second pcr products, or in some cases the first pcr products, if observed, were purified and sequenced with specific pcr primers or the universal reverse primer . if necessary, internal primers were designed and used in primer walking.

in the case of sulfolobus metallicus, the reverse primer hybridized outside of the cbf <dig> gene in the 3' downstream region, and the pcr product included up to the termination codon of the cbf <dig> gene as well as the partial sequence of another coding region that partially overlapped cbf <dig> 

in the initial screening of the thermofilum species, the above-mentioned combinations of primers did not work. thus, we used p- <dig>  and p- <dig> . only the t. pendens pre-amplified dna gave a product with the expected size. sequence information from the product was used to design specific primers . a semi-nested pcr that used p- <dig>  and p- <dig>  and a degenerate primer  gave the products from non-amplified dnas from both t. pendens and 'thermofilum librum'. using the obtained sequence information, we designed specific primers . to amplify the remaining portion of the 5' region of 't. librum' cbf <dig>  semi-nested pcr that used p- <dig>  and p- <dig>  and p- <dig>  was performed.

primer sequences as well as species-specific primers used in the nested pcr and sequencing analysis are shown in table  <dig> and , respectively. the deduced protein sequences from the thermofilum species are identical; thus, we used only one sequence designated as thermofilum in the phylogenetic analysis.

for strains of aeropyrum pernix, pcr was performed with p- <dig> and p- <dig> as described in  <cit> . the pcr product was treated with sap-it  and used directly  in a sequencing reaction with one of the pcr primers to determine a 249-bp region.

newly reported sequences were deposited in the ddbj/embl/genbank database under the accession numbers  to ,  to ,  to , and  to .

during the preparation of this manuscript, genome sequence data from staphylothermus marinus  <cit>  , hyperthermus butylicus  <cit>  , metallosphaera sedula  , thermofilum pendens  <cit>  , caldivirga maquilingensis  , pyrobaculum arsenaticum  , pyrobaculum islandicum  , and thermoproteus neutrophilus  , of which cbf <dig> we sequenced, became available. however, the gene annotation was different from ours when the gene had the putative intron . our sequence determination was independently performed before the release date of the data from other groups; the data from the additional  <dig> species were deposited to the database on may  <dig>   <dig>  note that, as for s. marinus and h. butylicus, we released the partial cbf <dig> sequence data on june  <dig>   <dig>  thus, we used our data for the above-mentioned seven species in the following analysis. to avoid the confusion, we did not include information of the above-mentioned seven species from other groups in table  <dig> 

sequence and phylogenetic analysis
rna secondary structure was predicted with the mfold version  <dig>  web server   <cit> . the putative exon-intron boundaries were assigned between the first and second letters of the codon for the catalytic aspartic residue of cbf <dig>  <cit> . the predicted bhb motifs were also considered for the prediction of the exon-intron borders . the alignment of the cbf <dig> protein sequences ) was performed with clustalw  <cit>  . well-aligned regions were then selected  with gblocks  <cit>  with the following parameters: the minimum number of sequences for a conserved position was  <dig>  the minimum number of sequences for a flanking position was  <dig>  the maximum number of contiguous nonconserved positions was  <dig>  and the minimum length of a block was  <dig>  tree reconstruction was performed with the treefinder version of june  <dig>   <cit>  under the wag+g model   <cit> ) and mrbayes  <dig>    <cit>  under the wag+i+g model  and a proportion of invariable sites). for the bayesian inference analysis , a markov chain monte carlo analysis was run for  <dig> , <dig> generations, and trees were built in 100-generation intervals . statistical support for the maximum likelihood inference tree was evaluated with a non-parametric bootstrap test with  <dig>  re-sampling events. the au   <cit> , np   <cit> , and kh   <cit>  tests were performed with consel  <cit> . for these tests, to reduce number of trees to be considered, analyses were performed with the grouping of the sequences to form a reduced number of the dataset  with codeml in paml  <dig>   <cit>  under the wag+g model  . the tree topologies tested were selected by the preliminary maximum likelihood analysis performed with tree-puzzle  <dig>   <cit>  . same dataset was also used for bayesian inference with mrbayes  <dig> . in figure  <dig>  the obtained tree with bayesian inference was shown. the 16s rrna phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by using treefinder version of june  <dig> and mrbayes  <dig>  under the gtr+i+g model . the 16s rrna gene sequences  were aligned with clustal x  <cit>  under the default condition. the well-aligned regions were selected  with gblocks under the default condition for nucleotide sequences. the model was selected by using modeltest  <dig>   <cit>  with paup4b <dig>  <cit>  under akaike's information criterion. the alignment of the cbf <dig> intron with the flanking sequences was performed with r-coffee  <cit>  using default parameters. most calculations were performed using a macpro  with a  <dig> -ghz 8-core  xeon intel processor and 8-gb memory.

RESULTS
our previous analysis of crenarchaeal cbf <dig> genes showed that only orders desulfurococcales and sulfolobales have the  intron in their cbf <dig> genes, although some species in the order desulfurococcales do not have the intron. however, phylogenetic analysis with the previous dataset did not strongly support the sister grouping of orders desulfurococcales and sulfolobales without species from other orders, and the phylogenetic positions of the species in desulfurococcales, which do not have the intron, were unclear  <cit> .

to improve the phylogenetic analysis of the cbf <dig> gene, we extended the analyzed region of the genes from  <dig> species to include an additional area in the 3' region , and we added new sequences from an additional  <dig> crenarchaeal species. we also added the recent information from the newly determined crenarchaeal and korarchaeal genomes. the species and the intron size information are summarized in . when the presence of the intron was expected, the new putative exon-intron borders from seven species among the additional  <dig> species were subjected to a prediction of their secondary structures  intron among the previously characterized  <dig> species, see reference  <cit> ). except for the cases of 'caldococcus noboribetus' and acidianus brierleyi, the predicted structures in the pre-mrnas have an unconventional bhb structure  <cit> , which should be recognized and cleaved by the hetero-oligomeric splicing endonuclease, as demonstrated previously  <cit> . recent x-ray crystallography has revealed that hetero-oligomeric splicing endonuclease is a dimer of hetero-dimers  <cit> . the predicted cleavage sites between the second and the third residues in the bulges of the bhb motif were consistent with the expected exon-intron borders, suggesting that the predicted exon-intron borders were convincing. in fact, partial cdna sequences of spliced cbf <dig> mrna from desulfurococcus amylolyticus, desulfurococcus mucosus, staphylothermus hellenicus, acidianus brierleyi and ignisphaera aggregans were consistent with the predictions , although the definite identification of the borders of the remaining species requires a cdna sequencing and cleavage study using splicing endonuclease. results from our present study, together with the previous study  <cit> , indicate that among the order desulfurococcales, ignicoccus spp. and all species from family pyrodictiaceae do not have the cbf <dig> intron.

using a new dataset, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees of the cbf <dig> protein sequence by using maximum likelihood  and bayesian methods . these trees suggested the monophyly of the cbf <dig> protein sequences from orders desulfurococcales and sulfolobales. we verified this monophyly with several statistical tests . to finish the computation within a reasonable time  using the available computational environment with a reduced number of trees to be considered, we first reduced the number of sequences in the dataset and reconstructed the phylogenetic tree . there was no significant difference in the tree topology before and after the reduction of the sequence . then, we fixed the relationships within each of the eight groups  and examined the relationships between the groups . the results of the tests supported the monophyly of the sequences from orders desulfurococcales and sulfolobales  and also suggested the inclusion of the sequence of 'korarchaeum' into the crenarchaeal sequences. the result is consistent with the phylogenetic association of rrna and protein sequences from 'korarchaeum' and crenarchaea  <cit> .

the sequences from the species of family pyrodictiaceae and ignicoccus spp. are grouped independently, and these monophylies were strongly supported with high statistical values in the trees . although among orders desulfurococcales and sulfolobales, these groups are not likely to be the earliest branching , the branching order among order desulfurococcales, particularly of ignisphaera aggregans, was uncertain. thus, we examined whether the sequences of family pyrodictiaceae and/or ignicoccus spp. branched earliest among the order desulfurococcales, except for ignisphaera aggregans, by using au, np, and kh tests of an alternative grouping set . the monophyly of the desulfurococcaceae  was rejected by the au test  and np test   but not by the kh test . if ignisphaera aggregans was not considered, the monophyly of the desulfurococcaceae  would be supported by only small probabilities by the au test and kh test  and rejected by the np test . the monophyletic grouping of the desulfurococcaceae  with the intron and the pyrodictiaceae was supported by the au, np, and kh tests . these results suggest that the sequences of the pyrodictiaceae  are unlikely to be the earliest branching. the monophyletic grouping of desulfurococcaceae  with the intron and ignicoccus spp.  was also supported by the au, np, and kh tests . these results also suggest that the sequence of ignicoccus spp. is not likely to be the earliest branching as seen in the bayesian tree of figure  <dig>  the monophyly of desulfurococcaceae  + desulfurococcaceae   could not be rejected by the au and kh tests because of their medium probabilities , but this monophyly was rejected by the np test . the monophyly of ignisphaera aggregans + pyrodictiaceae also cannot be rejected by the au, np, and kh tests because of their medium probabilities . the monophyly of desulfurococcaceae  + pyrodictiaceae was not rejected by the tests . finally, the monophyly of species with the intron was not rejected by the tests . therefore, the sequence of both ignicoccus spp. and the pyrodictiaceae was unlikely to be the earliest simultaneous branching, as seen in the tree presented in figure  <dig>  these results suggest that the sequences of these groups are not likely to be the earliest branching, although the possibility was not completely excluded. as a reference, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of 16s rrna of the corresponding species by using the bayesian method . the 16s rrna tree also supported the monophyletic groupings of orders desulfurococcales and sulfolobales, ignicoccus spp. and desulfurococcaceae , and pyrodictiaceae and desulfurococcaceae , suggesting that there was no obvious gene transfer of cbf <dig> from outside of orders desulfurococcales and sulfolobales. about 6% of protein-coding genes in ignicoccus hospitalis are thought to be transferred from its symbiont 'nanoarchaea'  <cit> . however, in our analysis, the monophyletic grouping of cbf <dig> genes in ignicoccus spp. with the nanoarchaeal sequence was not supported. thus, the cbf <dig> gene in ignicoccus spp. is not likely due to gene transfer of the intron-less nanoarchaeal cbf <dig> gene.

we also aligned the  cbf <dig> introns with the flanking sequences using the program r-coffee with the rna secondary structure prediction option . the alignment showed some conservation in the intron region beyond base-pairing with the exon regions to maintain the motif required for cleavage by the splicing endonuclease, suggesting a common origin for these introns. note that the internal region of the introns was highly variable likely due to the independence of recognition by the splicing endonuclease during the cleavage at the exon-intron borders.

the origin of the archaeal cbf <dig> intron is still unclear. we previously proposed that relaxed substrate specificity  <cit>  of the hetero-oligomeric splicing endonuclease  <cit>  led to the birth of the pre-mrna intron, which frequently contains the relaxed cleavage motif . in particular, the recognition of the relaxed cleavage motif within a non-trna context has been shown to be characteristic of crenarchaeal hetero-tetrameric splicing endonuclease  <cit> . although the intron sizes in cbf <dig> and rrna are different from one another, as discussed below, archaeal rrna introns are observed mainly in crenarchaeal species, which are expected to have the crenarchaeal hetero-tetrameric splicing endonuclease  <cit> . in some cases, archaeal rrna introns also have the relaxed cleavage motifs  <cit> . the size of archaeal trna introns  are more similar to those in crenarchaeal cbf <dig>  and accumulation of trna introns in crenarchaeal species is observed  <cit> . the unconventional cleavage motif at the exon-intron borders and the intron location at the position rather than the usual position "37/38" of trna intron are also observed more frequently in crenarchaeal species  <cit> . the contribution of the hetero-tetrameric splicing endonuclease is suggested for the cleavage of the unconventional motif, and has been demonstrated by the crenarchaeal hetero-tetrameric splicing endonuclease .

numerous archaeal rrna introns contain the open reading frame for dna endonuclease, which functions as a homing endonuclease to make the intron as a mobile element . apparently, the archaeal cbf <dig> intron is too short  to encode such a nuclease. nomura et al. found that a. pernix isolates have variations in the number, sequence, and positions of rrna introns  <cit>  . in the present study, we determined partial cbf <dig> sequences of these a. pernix isolates. together with the results of the previous studies for type strain k <dig>  <cit> , we found that at the corresponding positions, all of the analyzed cbf <dig> genes have a putative intron, classified as type  <dig> or type  <dig> , which contains only two base substitutions. there was no correlation between the variation of cbf <dig> and rrna introns . although sequence variation of rrna introns between a. pernix isolates  were observed, this was not correlated with the variation of the cbf <dig> intron. however, a correlation between the cbf <dig> intron and rada phylogeny shown by nomura et al.  <cit>  was observed . our results show that, as for the large-scale in-del event, the cbf <dig> intron was more conserved than the rrna introns with the homing dna endonuclease gene. however, nomura et al.  <cit>  also found that some of the rrna introns are deletion derivatives of the introns with an open reading frame. for example, a. perinix introns i delta and i zeta are deletion derivatives of i alpha and i gamma, respectively  <cit> . the contemporary cbf <dig> introns may be examples of such deletion derivatives. proof of this possibility requires further taxonomic sampling of cbf <dig> genes to find the intron that includes the protein-coding sequence.

peng et al. showed that during the generation of infection, putative 12-bp introns were inserted into protein-coding genes in an archaeal virus genome, although splicing was not demonstrated and the mechanism of insertion of the 12-bp sequence is unknown  <cit> . interestingly, the sizes of the cbf <dig> introns from staphylothermus hellenicus and s. marinus are  <dig> bp ; thus, mechanisms of insertion of archaeal cbf <dig> introns and the putative introns in the archaeal virus genome may be related. furthermore, the cbf <dig> introns of stetteria hydrogenophila  and ignisphaera aggregans , as well as s. hellenicus and s. marinus, do not change the reading frame. the putative introns in the virus genome may not be spliced out and the coding region with such insertions may produce functional proteins. however, in the case of cbf <dig> introns, the insertion disrupts the codon of the catalytic residue of the protein  <cit> , and thus these must be spliced out if the organism needs the functional protein.

one possible explanation of the putative secondary loss of the cbf <dig> intron in certain lineages is that the intron-containing gene is replaced with a sequence without the intron, possibly produced by reverse transcription of the spliced mrna  <cit> , or the spliced mrna itself. although reverse transcriptase activity has not been observed in crenarchaeal cells, the presence of a putative reverse transcriptase gene in some archaeal genomes has been suggested  <cit> . in fact, in the sequenced genomes of ignicoccus hospitalis and hyperthermus butylicus  with the putative secondary loss of the cbf <dig> intron, candidate reverse transcriptase genes were identified . an alternative possibility could be the requirement of higher activity of pseudouridine synthase in a certain environment. previously, we proposed that the cbf <dig> intron functions as a negative regulator of the expression of pseudouridine synthase  <cit> . archaeal cbf <dig> catalyzes pseudouridine formation in rrna and trna together with other associated proteins using a guide rna  <cit>  or without a guide rna  <cit> . incorporation of pseudouridine in rna increases the thermodynamic stability of rna  <cit> . furthermore, pseudouridylation of trna at position  <dig> by trub in mesophilic bacteria escherichia coli supports the resistance to higher temperature  <cit> . archaeal cbf <dig>  a member of trub family  <cit> , also forms a pseudouridine in trna at position  <dig>  <cit> . thus, at extremely high temperatures, the organisms might not prefer the down-regulation system of the pseudouridine synthase and lose it.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study suggest that cbf <dig> gained the intron in the common ancestor of orders desulfurococcales and sulfolobales, and that cbf <dig> lost the intron independently in the ancestors of the family pyrodictiaceae and ignicoccus spp. since we found the first examples of cbf <dig> introns, sequences of three crenarchaeal genomes with the cbf <dig> intron have been determined. however, the cbf <dig> intron in these genomes was misidentified  or ignored . even for the first three examples in a. pernix, s. solfataricus, and s. tokodaii, the gene prediction of these examples was still confused with cases of translational frame-shifting by other researchers  <cit> . although there was no confirmation of archaeal pre-mrna splicing for genes other than cbf <dig>  the presence of the putative intron in other protein-coding genes was predicted  <cit> . to completely understand protein-coding genes in archaeal genomes, tools for effective prediction of introns in archaeal protein-coding genes must be developed with comparative or computational methods  <cit> . experimental confirmation of the predictions, including the putative cbf <dig> introns predicted in our studies, is indispensable.
