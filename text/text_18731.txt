BACKGROUND
chondromodulin-i  is a naturally occurring anti-angiogenic glycoprotein that localizes to the avascular domains of mesenchymal tissues such as cartilage, cardiac valves, and the eye  <cit> , where angiogenesis is strictly limited. using both recombinant and adenovirally expressed chm-i protein, we have demonstrated that chm-i inhibits the migration, proliferation, and tube morphogenesis of cultured vascular endothelial cells, and suppresses tumor angiogenesis  <cit> . moreover, chm-i-deficient mice show a vascularized phenotype in their aged cardiac valves, which is caused by a loss of anti-angiogenic valvular functions and abnormal vascular invasion  <cit> . these studies suggest that chm-i may serve as a matrix component that confers anti-angiogenic resistance to specific mesenchymal tissues.

during mouse skeletal development, expression of chm-i was dramatically increased in association with cartilage formation. in situ hybridization revealed that the transcripts were detected at the sites of chondrogenesis such as the occipital bone rudiments at  <dig> days p.c. in mouse embryos. then the specific expression of chm-i became apparent in all cartilaginous skeletal elements in the body including the nasal septum, tracheal rings, ribs, and vertebral column  <cit> . prior to chondrogenesis, chm-i transcripts were detected in cardiac valve precursor cells of the heart at  <dig>  days post coitum  and its expression persisted in cardiac valves in the adult  <cit> .

in the course of our study to explore the sites of chm-i expression in early stages of development, we carried out northern blot analysis of pregnant mouse uterus and found it to be a prominent expression site at  <dig>  day p.c. or later. then, after detailed analysis, we unexpectedly found that intense  hybridization signals were detected in maternal tissues such as decidua rather than embryos at this early stage of pregnancy. in this study, we determined the differentiated mouse decidua as a novel site of chm-i expression and found that chm-i transcripts were induced by the decidualization of endometrial stromal cells in vitro. we examined here a possible involvement of chm-i in angiogenic events and tissue remodeling of decidua by a matrigel invasion assay in vitro.

RESULTS
expression of chm-i in the decidua during the early implantation period
in mice, implantation occurs at between  <dig> - <dig>  days p.c. and triggers the transformation of uterine stroma into the cohesive spongy tissue called decidua. this event accompanies drastic tissue remodeling via the uterine angiogenesis and the invasion of trophoblasts to make feto-maternal connections required for the maintenance of pregnancy. by northern blot analysis, chm-i transcripts were undetectable in the uterus at  <dig>  days p.c. as well as in the non-pregnant mouse uterus . these transcripts became barely detectable at  <dig>  days p.c. and were at their most abundant levels at  <dig>  days p.c. the expression levels gradually declined from the onset of placentation  onward. the temporal pattern of chm-i expression was thus found to be similar to that of prl8a <dig>  , which is expressed in the trophoblasts and the decidua  <cit> . in contrast, transcripts for timp- <dig>  and vegf-a <dig> , both known angiogenesis-related gene products expressed in the decidua, increased until  <dig>  days p.c., and then rapidly disappeared. as shown in figure 1b, rt-pcr analysis of a pregnant mouse uterus  indicated that chm-i expression was strongly detected in the maternal decidua that also expressed prl8a <dig>  but was marginal in the embryonic tissue that was positive for brachyury, a marker of the mesoderm  <cit> . the placenta , which is formed through the fusion of the decidua, epc , chorion, and parts of the allantois, was also positive for chm-i.

in situ hybridization revealed that the chm-i transcripts were first detected around the epc, which contains undifferentiated populations of trophoblast, at  <dig>  days p.c. . interestingly we found that timp- <dig> was strongly expressed in the primary decidua, a mature portion of this structure, and that the localization of timp- <dig> transcripts was complementary to that of chm-i . at  <dig>  days p.c., the site of chm-i expression was considerably expanded to the entire primary decidua, whilst timp- <dig> expression was restricted to the thin layer of the primary decidua closer to the implanting embryo. the expression sites of these angiogenesis inhibitors were found to overlap with that of prl8a <dig>  and the invasive trophoblast giant cells that express a high level of mmp- <dig>  and prl3d <dig>   at the margin of the implantation chamber. by  <dig>  days p.c., chm-i transcripts were found to be expressed at a lower level around the epc, where mmp- <dig> expressing trophoblast giant cells invade the decidua basalis to form the placenta . these dynamic changes in the expression pattern of chm-i are suggestive of their functional role in regulating the invasion of mmp- <dig> expressing trophoblasts.

localization of chm-i protein in the decidua
just after implantation, trophoblasts immediately invade the decidual matrix and form vascular connections with the maternal blood supply  <cit> . we therefore examined the localization of chm-i protein in the decidua at  <dig>  days p.c., comparing it with the distribution of maternal vascular networks and invading trophoblasts . to visualize the invading fetal tissue and the maternal vasculature, transgenic male mice ubiquitously expressing egfp were mated with wild-type female mice, and the decidual sections were stained with anti-pecam- <dig> antibody . pecam- <dig> immunoreactivity was detected in the whole decidua and was relatively strong in the primary decidua surrounding the egfp-positive fetal invading cells . consistent with its mrna localization , secreted chm-i protein was detected in a punctate distribution in the primary decidua, where pecam-1-positive maternal blood vessels and the invading trophoblasts may strongly interact with each other .

expression of genes associated with angiogenesis and ecm remodeling in cultured decidual cells and epcs
tissue remodeling and angiogenesis are two hallmark events that represent active tissue-tissue interactions at the feto-maternal interface during implantation and decidualization. invading trophoblasts express mmps to facilitate matrix remodeling, and respond to a number of growth factors produced by the decidua. concurrently, the maternal vasculature is also stimulated and directed to the implanted embryo by angiogenic factors produced in the decidua  <cit> . rt-pcr indicated that decidual cells expressed angiogenic growth factors such as vegf-a, fgf- <dig> , and igf-i , whilst epcs were positive for their cognate receptors . moreover, epcs predominantly expressed mmp- <dig>  a molecule believed to be crucial for tissue remodeling. in contrast, cultured decidual cells expressed all of timps that were examined . these results are compatible with the notion that trophoblasts are capable of responding to angiogenic and anti-angiogenic signal cues produced by the decidua.

induction of chm-i expression by the decidualization of endometrial stromal cells in vitro
decidualized endometrial stromal cells swell up their cell volume and produce basement membrane-like ecms such as type iv collagen, laminin, and fibronectin instead of the interstitial matrices  <cit> . to investigate the expression of chm-i in decidual cells, the cells were enzymatically isolated from the decidual capsules of mice at  <dig>  days p.c., and cultured for seven days in vitro in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum . as previously reported  <cit> , the isolated cells were predominantly large, flattened, polygonal, and some were multi-nucleated . the expression of chm-i transcripts was monitored along with the detection of decidual cell-differentiation marker genes by rt-pcr . while abundant type i collagen transcripts were detected only in undifferentiated endometrial stromal cells, a high level of type iv collagen was maintained in the cultured cells  <cit> . . in contrast, the expression levels of prl8a <dig> markedly declined  during one week of culture, although no morphological changes of cells were apparent. expression of chm-i was readily detectable in the  <dig>  days p.c. decidual capsules, but the capacity for chm-i expression was only barely maintained when decidual cells were transferred into culture.

kimura and coworkers have demonstrated previously that mouse endometrial stromal cells undergo decidualization in vitro in the presence of 17β-estradiol  and progesterone   <cit> . we isolated endometrial stromal cells from 4-week-old immature female mice using their protocol  <cit> , and cultured the cells with or without e <dig> and p <dig>  without e <dig>  and p <dig> , endometrial stromal cells retained the spindle-shaped morphology of fibroblasts throughout the culture period. however, when cultured in the presence of e <dig> and p <dig>  these cells adopted rounded morphologies with enlarged and/or multiple nuclei , resembling the decidual cells in culture shown in figure 5a. rt-pcr analysis of total rna from cells indicated that there was no apparent expression of chm-i when the cells were cultured without e <dig> and p <dig> . in contrast, chm-i and prl8a <dig> transcripts were induced by the addition of e <dig> and p <dig> to these cultures, even though the expression level was relatively low compared with that of the decidua at  <dig>  days p.c. . in situ hybridization to the cultured cells revealed that no hybridization signals were present in spindle-shaped endometrial stromal cells cultured without e <dig> and p <dig>  but that hypertrophic rounded cells with enlarged and/or multiple nuclei formed in the presence of e <dig> and p <dig> exhibited positive signals for prl8a <dig> mrna as a result of decidualization . positive immunoreactivity to chm-i protein was readily detected also in these decidualized hypertrophic cells , but not without e <dig> and p <dig>  these results indicate that chm-i is induced in association with the decidualization of endometrial stromal cells.

effects of rhchm-i on the migration of rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells
taking advantage of rat rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells, which are capable of recapitulating trophoblast giant cell differentiation in vitro  <cit> , we examined whether recombinant human chm-i  affects the chemotactic migration of trophoblasts. in the growth medium, rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells retained an undifferentiated state with a low level of expression of genes such as prl3d <dig>  a marker for trophoblast differentiation, and mmp- <dig>  a terminal differentiation associated marker . when the cells reached confluence, the culture medium was replaced with differentiation medium containing horse serum. expression of these marker genes evidently increased by day  <dig> . no chm-i transcripts were detected in cells cultured in either growth or differentiation medium . the effects of rhchm-i were then tested using modified boyden chambers. subconfluent rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells cultured in growth medium were serum-starved and seeded onto migration inserts that had been coated with fibronectin, one of the abundant matrix components in the decidua. among the angiogenic growth factors expressed in the decidual cells , fgf- <dig>  and igf-i, but not vegf-a, exhibited a pronounced stimulatory effect on the chemotactic migration of rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells. igf-i induced the migration of these cells by approximately two-fold over the non-stimulated basal levels . in contrast, the addition of rhchm-i to the cultures clearly inhibited the igf-i-induced migration of the cells in a dose-dependent manner. at a dose of  <dig>  μg/ml or higher, igf-i-induced migration was completely abolished .

anti-invasive effects of rhchm-i upon rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells
the invasive activity of rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells was examined . gelatin zymography revealed that rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells produced the active form of mmp- <dig> in association with their differentiation to trophoblast giant cells when the cells are cultured in differentiation medium containing 10% horse serum . activated mmp- <dig> was secreted as the predominant gelatinolytic activity, and mmp- <dig> and their zymogens were undetectable. gm <dig> , an inhibitor of broad spectrum mmp, partially reduced the activation of pro-mmp- <dig>  but the addition of rhchm-i in culture produced no apparent effect on the formation of activated mmp- <dig> . despite this, rhchm-i clearly inhibited the invasion of differentiated rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells into matrigel in a dose-dependent manner . rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells took on well-spread motile morphologies with active lamellipodia formation  and actively invaded a matrigel layer in boyden chamber  under low serum conditions with  <dig> % horse serum, which allow differentiation of the cells  <cit> . in the presence of rhchm-i, most cells took on quite distinctive static morphologies suggestive of their lower motility .

discussion
along with the invasion of trophoblasts into the maternal endometrium, sequential decidual reactions occur and lead to the formation of two distinct zones: the differentiated zone proximal to an implanting embryo termed the primary decidual zone, and the distal peripheral zone consisting of immature mitotic decidual cells, termed the secondary decidual zone  <cit> . in our present study, we have demonstrated that chm-i is expressed in the primary decidual zone during early pregnancy in mice. in contrast to prl8a <dig>  which is broadly expressed in decidual tissue and strongly induced during decidualization  <cit> , chm-i transcripts were localized to well-differentiated decidual cells in the primary decidual zone and were not detectable in the secondary decidual zone. consistent with this, chm-i was induced in cultured endometrial stromal cells that were undergoing decidualization in the presence of estrogen and progesterone in vitro. both chm-i protein and prl8a <dig> mrna were evident in the enlarged multi-nucleated well-differentiated cells in primary cultures of decidual cells  <cit> .

the invasion of trophoblasts and maternal blood vessels are coordinately regulated in the primary decidual zone during early pregnancy. it has been known that the primary decidual zone remains to be vascularized prior to the invasion of trophoblasts  <cit> . interestingly, chm-i expression is predominantly detected at the mesometrial side of primary decidua facing the zone of vascularization, whereas the intense signals for timp- <dig> expression, another marker for well-differentiated decidual cells  <cit> , were found at the antimesometrial side of primary decidua. when the trophoblasts were extensively detected along the margin of the implantation chamber at  <dig>  days p.c., chm-i was expressed at the entire zone of the primary decidua surrounding the invading trophoblasts, suggesting that chm-i may participate in the invasion processes of trophoblasts.

the capacity for ecm degradation is one of the critical components required for the invasive behavior of cells  <cit> . trophoblasts indeed express various kinds of proteinases, and proteinase inhibitors are localized in the decidua. for instance, it has been shown that timps, cystatins, and plasminogen activator inhibitors are expressed in the distinct domains of the decidua  <cit> . in particular, mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> are expressed at considerably high levels in the periphery of the implantation chamber and are thought to be pivotal regulators of ecm remodeling during the invasion of trophoblasts. however, trophoblast invasion proceeded relatively unhindered by the administration of a synthetic mmp inhibitor gm <dig> into pregnant mice or the overexpression of timp- <dig>  <cit> , while these treatments had led to a reduced size of the decidua and mesometrial displacement of an embryo. these observations are compatible with our present results showing that gm <dig> had only a marginal inhibitory effect on the invasion of rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells. timp- <dig> had also little impact on the matrigel invasion of rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells . in contrast, chm-i exhibited remarkable anti-invasive activity in the matrigel invasion assay of rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells, even though it did not interfere with the production and activation of gelatinases in the cells. the anti-invasive activity of rhchm-i was also evident in the matrigel invasion of huvecs  <cit> , in which gm <dig> was ineffective to block the invasion of cells .

we have previously demonstrated that chm-i inhibits the migration of vascular endothelial cells induced by angiogenic growth factors including vegf-a, fgf- <dig>  and igf-i  <cit> . as suggested by the present rt-pcr study, epcs are also capable of responding to these growth factors. indeed, it has been reported also that igf-i is a potent stimulator of mouse epc cells and human trophoblast migration  <cit> . similarly, igf-i and fgf- <dig>  but not vegf-a , stimulated the migration of rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells in culture. using a modified boyden chamber assay, we found that rhchm-i completely abolishes the igf-i-induced migration of rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells. morphologies of chm-i-treated rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells are also indicative of a critical reduction in cellular motility. this mode of chm-i action is analogous to that on huvecs  <cit> . thus, chm-i is likely to inhibit the invasion of rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells and vascular endothelial cells by suppressing their cellular motility stimulated by igf-i.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that chm-i is expressed in the primary decidual zone during decidualization at feto-maternal interface. recombinant chm-i inhibited the migration and invasion of rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells in a manner independent of mmp activation in vitro.
