BACKGROUND
folate one-carbon metabolism  plays an integral role in human development and disease. genetic variants in folate pathway genes are associated with increased risk for neural tube defects    <cit> , cardiovascular disease  <cit> , cancer  <cit>  and cognitive decline  <cit> . women taking supplemental folic acid prior to conception significantly reduce their chance of having an ntd affected pregnancy  <cit> . the mechanism by which folic acid reduces the incidence of ntd’s has not been fully elucidated.

neural tube defects are a common congenital malformation affecting  <dig> in  <dig> conceptuses. in humans, neural tube closure occurs by day  <dig> post-conception and involves a complex co-ordination of morphogenic activities and regulatory processes. events this early in development are not amenable to study in humans and difficult to observe in mammalian model organisms. the mouse is a well-developed model organism for studying neural tube defects and the role of folate, however the research is limited by litter size and stage at which the defects can be studied  <cit> . for example, homozygous mutants in methionine synthase, an enzyme in the folate pathway , are embryonic lethal and are resorbed prior to e <dig>   <cit> . while the role of the folate pathway during development is being investigated in the invertebrate model organisms drosophila <cit>  and c. elegans <cit>  , these models are evolutionarily distant from vertebrates. as with the invertebrate models, zebrafish can be studied in large numbers and are more closely related to mammals. the mechanical and structural aspects of neural tube formation in zebrafish differ from that found in mammals  <cit>  but the genetic programs of notochord formation and development are shared between fish and humans  <cit> . the significant advantages of working with zebrafish  may render it a useful investigative model for studying the role of folate in development and disease.

folate, also known as vitamin b <dig>  is a cofactor for enzymes involved in cellular transmethylation reactions and de novo synthesis of purines and thymidylate  <cit> . in its reduced form, the folate molecule acts a carrier of single carbon units. the ultimate donors of the methyl groups are serine, glycine, histidine and formate. methylated folates are cofactors in two steps during inosine synthesis  and in the synthesis of thymidylate . the third major cellular reaction using folates as a co-factor is the methionine cycle, whereby the methyl group is added to homocysteine to form methionine. the subsequent product s-adenosyl-methionine is used in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, methylation of phospholipids, dna methylation, histone methylation and mrna capping. folate dependent enzymes are found in the mitochondria, cytoplasm, and nucleus. folate is a water-soluble vitamin found primarily in leafy vegetables. due to its protective effect in early pregnancy, folate fortification is mandated in the us with synthetic folate in the form of folic acid added to milled grain products.

we sought to evaluate the zebrafish as a model for studying vertebrate folate and one-carbon metabolism. we aimed to understand the role of focm in early organ development. there is little to no information on these pathways in fish. using bioinformatics we have identified zebrafish orthologs of  <dig> human folate metabolic genes and characterized their spatial and temporal expression patterns. chemical and genetic disruption of these pathways demonstrated that the folate pathway is essential for several aspects of zebrafish development, as treated embryos are embryonic lethal. we show cell cycle perturbations as a result of defects in focm. we hypothesize these defects are the result of reduced folate substrates for thymidylate synthase, a rate-limiting enzyme in dna synthesis. zebrafish studies of the folate pathway and its deficiencies could provide insight into the underlying etiology of human birth defects and the natural role of folate in development.

RESULTS
cloning & rt-pcr
orthologs of eleven enzymes and one transporter involved in folate-one carbon metabolism were identified in zebrafish by blast searches, cloned, and characterized . the six previously un-annotated genes were sequenced and submitted to the zfin nomenclature committee  and updated sequences were submitted to genbank. expression of these genes during development was measured via rt-pcr and rna in situ hybridization. most genes identified in this pathway appear to be ‘house keeping’ genes that are maternally loaded, present throughout early embryonic development, and whose expression is predominantly enriched in anterior cns .

mthfd <dig> is a cytoplasmic trifunctional enzyme that interconverts methylene thf, methenyl thf, formyl thf, and formate. these folates serve as substrates for downstream reactions that synthesize thymidylate, methionine, and inosine. the protein is partitioned into an n-terminal bifunctional dehydrogenase and cyclohydrase domain , and a c-terminal synthetase domain . the mitochondrial protein, mthfd1l retains a functional synthetase domain. however, while the n-terminal domain is present, mutations in critical residues results in the predicted loss of these enzymatic functions  <cit> . the mitochondrial dehydrogenase and cyclohydrase reactions are performed by the proteins mthfd <dig> and mthfd2l. mthfd <dig> is only found in transformed mammalian cells and embryonic or nondifferentiated tissues  <cit>  and is essential during embryonic development  <cit> . mthfd2l has recently been shown to be the active mitochondrial enzyme in adult tissues  <cit> . orthologs of all these human proteins are found in zebrafish. two paralogs of mthfd <dig>  are found in zebrafish: mthfd1a has 57% identity  to the human protein and is located on chromosome  <dig>  mthfd1b has 77% identity  and is located on chromosome  <dig>  mthfd1b is the likely true ortholog of human mthfd <dig> as it retains the conserved amino acids in the catalytic domains of this trifunctional enzyme. however, mthfd1a has a predicted mitochondrial leader sequence  and has mutations in conserved catalytic residues in the synthetase domain. this transcript is dynamically regulated within the first  <dig> hpf. mthfd1b is expressed throughout early development. at  <dig> hpf, both transcripts are enriched in the cns, with mthfd1b also expressed in the ysl . an ortholog of mthfd1l  can be identified in zebrafish, on chromosome  <dig>  with 81% identity  to the synthetase domain. while the zebrafish transcript is predicted to encode a mitochondrial leader sequence, the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrase domain has only 44% identity to the human protein. this transcript is not maternally expressed and is dynamically regulated throughout early development. its expression is not spatially restricted at  <dig> hpf . one ortholog of mthfd <dig>  is found on chromosome  <dig> in zebrafish with 80% identity . an mthfd2l ortholog is located on chromosome on  <dig>  with 67% identity . both of these transcripts are dynamically expressed throughout the first 72 hours of development, with expression at  <dig> hpf being enriched in the cns .

methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase  catalyzes the irreversible reduction of the one carbon donor group on folate to 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate. this form of folate is the carbon donor in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. an ortholog of the human protein  is found in the zebrafish genome on chromosome  <dig> with 79% identity  . this is also a maternally loaded transcript and is present throughout the early stages of development. at  <dig> hpf its expression is also enriched in the cns and myotomes .

methionine synthase , encoded by the gene mtr, is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, using 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate as the methyl group donor and the vitamin cofactor cobalamin . this enzyme sits at the intersection of the folate pathway and the methionine cycle. zebrafish has one ortholog of this protein  on chromosome  <dig> with 77% identity . the transcript is maternally loaded and present throughout the first three days of embryonic development. at 24hpf its expression is enriched in the cns .

thymidylate synthetase  is an enzyme involved in a rate-limiting step of dna synthesis: the methylation of dump to dtmp. this reaction uses a folate cofactor as the one carbon donor. an ortholog of the human protein  is found in the zebrafish genome on chromosome  <dig> with 82% identity . this is also a maternally loaded transcript and is present throughout the early stages of development. at  <dig> hpf its expression is also enriched in the cns .

we also investigated the transport protein, slc25a <dig> , a mitochondrial membrane protein that transports folate into the mitochondrion  <cit> . two paralogs of slc25a <dig>  are found in zebrafish. slc25a32a is located on chromosome  <dig> and has 66% identity  to the human protein. this transcript is also maternally expressed and is present throughout early development. at  <dig> hpf it is expression is not spatially restricted . slc25a32b is located on chromosome  <dig>  has 70% identity  to the human protein, and is expressed throughout early embryonic development. its expression is enriched in anterior neural tissues at  <dig> hpf .

dhfr inhibition
in order to investigate the role of the folate pathway in early zebrafish development, we inhibited dhfr by using either the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate or antisense morpholino oligonucleotides.

methotrexate is a folate analog that acts by competitively inhibiting dhfr  <cit> . zebrafish embryos were treated with varying concentrations of methotrexate, within 30 minutes of fertilization. at the highest concentration of methotrexate tested, 600 μm, most embryos died prior to  <dig> dpf. the few surviving embryos were morphologically abnormal, arresting between epiboly and early somitogenesis. as the concentration of methotrexate decreased, the severity of the phenotype diminished, but even the lowest concentration of methotrexate tested, 100 μm, resulted in embryonic lethality by  <dig> dpf. these fish were characterized by ventral edema, dorsal curvature, shortened a/p axis, and defective heart morphology. embryos treated with 200 μm methotrexate had a mild delay at tailbud stage. by  <dig> dpf, these embryos displayed necrotic heads and tails with dorsal curvature and a shortened a/p axis . embryos developed ventral edema and heart defects that ultimately resulted in embryonic lethality by day  <dig>  the majority of embryos treated with 400 μm methotrexate resulted in embryonic lethality prior to somitogenesis . a minority of embryos developed past early somitogenesis but had severely shortened a/p axis with necrosis throughout the embryo and cardiac defects.

folinic acid, a folate derivative that can enter the folate metabolic pathway without the enzymatic function of dhfr, is used during chemotherapy to ameliorate the toxic effects of methotrexate  <cit> . embryos pre-treated with folinic acid in addition to 200 μm methotrexate showed fewer severe defects at  <dig> dpf: less edema, fewer embryos with dorsal curvature and a decrease in cardiac defects . however, this treatment was unable to completely rescue methotrexate treatment as the embryos died by  <dig> dpf.

we confirmed the specificity of the observed defects being due to abrogation of the folate pathway by using morpholinos against dhfr. the same spectrum of defects was observed when embryos were treated with either translation or splice blocking morpholinos. microinjection of  <dig>  pmol of translation blocking morpholino  <cit>  resulted in over 50% of embryos displaying the severe defect of developmental arrest after tailbud stage . less than 10% of embryos treated with  <dig>  pmol of splice blocking morpholino, designed to bind the intron 3- exon  <dig> splicing boundary, exhibited this severe early phenotype . rt-pcr analysis of dhfr in treated embryos showed laddering bands characteristic of splicing defects   <cit> . sequencing results from these aberrant bands demonstrated that these bands were the result of skipping either exons  <dig> and  <dig> or just exon  <dig> and resulted in a pre-mature termination codon . with this treatment, most embryos exhibited shortened anterior-posterior axis, ventral edema, dorsal curvature, cardiac defects, and a noticeable decrease in their touch response, culminating in embryonic lethality. in contrast, injection of  <dig>  pmol of the 5 bp mismatch  translation blocking morpholino control resulted in 90% viability at  <dig> dpf. co-injection with a morpholino targeting p <dig>  which blocks nonspecific morpholino induced apoptosis, resulted in similar phenotypes as the dhfr atg morpholino alone .

differentiation and tissue specification
the developmental defects observed in fish with disruptions in one carbon metabolism could be due to failure of differentiation. to test this we performed in situ analysis of markers of primarily neuro-ectodermal tissues. this experiment demonstrated that while phenotypically abnormal, embryos treated with 400 μm methotrexate were able to specify developmentally appropriate tissues . the enveloping layer  develops and migrates, despite delays and defects in blastopore closure. treated embryos form a dorsal shield with involuting cells , which gives rise to neural plate and neural tube structures, respectively, by bud stage. ntl indicates margin cells during shield stage and notochord at bud stage. by  <dig> hpf, ntl staining indicates an abnormal shortened wavy notochord. this observation is supported by somite staining with myod. foxa <dig> and crestin, a marker of neural crest, also showed an abnormal staining pattern, but demonstrates that tissues are specified. finally, the hatching gland, hgg <dig>  indicates the anterior most structure of the zebrafish is also specified. the endothelial marker kdrl was appropriately specified, as were the anterior neural markers wnt <dig>  sox <dig>  and pax6a . while tissues queried were all appropriately specified, the notochord is abnormal and could indicate a defect in the overlying neural tube.

cell cycle aspects of folate pathway perturbations
embryos treated with methotrexate are phenotypically abnormal but tissues are normally specified. we hypothesized the defect is in the number of cells in the embryo, due to defects and delays in the cell cycle in response to reduced folate substrate for the enzyme thymidylate synthetase.

methotrexate treated embryos were assessed in their ability to incorporate the thymidine analog, brdu, into their dna. embryos treated with methotrexate readily incorporated brdu into their dna, demonstrating competence in s-phase . this assay is not sensitive enough to detect an increase in the number of cells in s-phase. in order to assess cells in m-phase, we performed immunocytochemistry using an antibody to phospho-histone h <dig>  a mitosis specific marker. embryos treated with methotrexate showed a decreased number of phospho-histone h <dig> positive cells . these data were supported by dna content analysis via flow cytometry. embryos treated with 200 μm methotrexate for 24 hours showed an increased proportion of cells in s-phase with a concomitant decrease in cells in m-phase . this defect was not observed in embryos pre-treated with folinic acid. embryos treated with 400 μm methotrexate demonstrated a severe skewing of cells to the 2 n and sub-2 n dna content. this sub-2 n dna peak suggests an increase in apoptotic cells. to test this possibility we performed tunel assays on treated and untreated embryos. embryos treated with methotrexate demonstrated an increase in apoptotic cells . methotrexate treatment causes s-phase delay, a decrease in the number of mitotic cells, and an increase in apoptosis, resulting in an overall decrease in the number of cells within the developing embryo.

discussion
our aim was to identify and characterize components of the folate pathway and to interrogate its role in early zebrafish development. twelve genes involved in folate metabolism were identified by blast searches, cloned, and their expression profiles studied by rt-pcr and rna in situ hybridization. we also assessed the impact of inhibiting the folate pathway in the developing zebrafish by treatment with the folate antagonist, methotrexate, and by microinjection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides designed to disrupt dhfr expression. inhibition of the folate pathway caused perturbations in the cell cycle, which resulted in embryonic lethality. while it is not surprising that this pathway is essential for development, the mechanism through which this inhibition acts had not been explored. we propose the primary defect in these fish is the lack of folate substrates for tyms, a rate-limiting step in dna synthesis, which results in the lack of dttp pools for dna synthesis. however, it is also possibile that other methylation reactions, requiring s-adenosylmethionine , also play a role in the defects we observed.

we set out to identify and clone  <dig> orthologs of folate genes in humans. we identified  <dig> orthologs and paralogs, presumably due to the partial genome duplication that occurred in teleosts  <cit> . the presence of paralogs can complicate studies that try to establish gene function by looking at single gene knock-out  phenotypes. one set of duplicated genes we identified was the mats: mat1a and mat2a. mat1a encodes the liver specific isoform of the enzyme. mat2a encodes the globally expressed isoform. zebrafish has four mat genes. one is clearly mat1a, with 77% identity to the human protein and liver expression at  <dig> dpf . two genes, mat2aa and mat2ab, appear to be paralogs of human mat2a, with 80% identity to the human protein and without liver restricted expression. the fourth gene, mat2al, has a temporal expression pattern similar to mat1a, but without the liver restricted expression, similar to the mat2as, and relatively low  identity to the human mat1a and mat2a proteins, respectively. this highlights one of the challenges of transferring pathways between species.

queried members of the folate pathway are generally maternally loaded and ubiquitously expressed , consistent with the idea that they are house-keeping genes involved in an essential cellular process. inhibition of the pathway with either the folate antagonist methotrexate or by using morpholinos targeting dhfr results in early embryonic lethality. further study of methotrexate treated embryos indicates defects in the cell cycle, specifically s-phase accumulation and increased apoptosis. by visual morphological criteria and in situ analysis embryos have a normal developmental program through bud stage. between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf development defects arise, as >80% of embryos treated with 400 μm methotrexate die overnight and the surviving embryos are anatomically abnormal. neural cells condense to form the neural plate around the  <dig> somites stage   <cit> . most embryos treated with methotrexate do not survive treatment to be queried specifically for neural tube defects. despite decreased cell numbers due to s-phase delay and concomitant decreased mitosis, the developmental program proceeds and appropriate tissues are specified, although the anterior-posterior axis is severely shortened and the notochord undulates. convergent/extension defects, resulting in embryos with a shortened a-p axis, are observed in zebrafish expressing rare variants of vangl <dig> that are associated with neural tube defects in humans  <cit> .

one limitation of using zebrafish as a model system for understanding genetic and environmental etiologies of neural tube defects is that the mechanics of zebrafish neurulation differs from that of human and mouse. zebrafish form a neural plate, which then progresses through a neural keel stage, to a solid neural rod which then cavitates to a neural tube  <cit> . zebrafish do not form a neural tube via the bending of the neural plate and fusing of opposing sides. in humans and mice, the failure of these tissues to fuse presents as a neural tube defect, whether in its lethal form of anencephaly or the milder state of spina bifida. however, many of the molecular and genetic aspects of neural tube formation are genetically conserved between humans and fish  <cit> .

the essential requirement for the folate pathway has been documented in other model organisms ranging from yeast to mice. of the genes we studied, only dfr <dig>  and cdc <dig>  are essential in budding yeast. mtr −/− mice are embryonic lethal prior to day e <dig>   <cit> . mthfd <dig> −/− mice also are embryonic lethal  <cit>  as are mthfd <dig> −/− mice, by day e <dig> , and can be distinguished by their smaller size and pale livers  <cit> . in contrast mthfr −/− knock out mice are viable, although with reduced viability, decreased body size, and cerebellar pathology  <cit> . a small number of reports have investigated folate pathway genes and mutants in zebrafish. sun et al. <cit>  reported cardiac defects in zebrafish dhfr morphants. similar cardiac defects were also reported for zebrafish embryos treated with methotrexate, as well as decreased expression of the cardiac markers   <cit> . neither study reports the early severe defects we observed nor do they interrogate cell cycle properties of affected embryos. zebrafish tyms mutants were identified in screens looking for genes essential for embryonic  <cit>  or defective in retinal development  <cit> . another zebrafish mutant with ocular defects has been identified as gart, one of two enzymes involved in purine metabolism that uses folate as a cofactor  <cit> . our identification and characterization of major components of the folate pathway in zebrafish increases the utility of this model organism in studying the role of folate in normal development and disease.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide the first in depth characterization of the folate pathway in zebrafish, by reporting the expression patterns of  <dig> genes, of which we name  <dig> genes in zfin and provide additional sequence information for  <dig> genes. we expand upon earlier studies that implicated dhfr in cardiac development by identifying an earlier defect in zebrafish. folate starved embryos start to show defects prior to segmentation. we propose this is due to defects in s phase, caused by decreased pools of thymidylate and consequently dttp, which in turn leads a lengthened cell cycle. as each round of division takes longer, fewer total cells are available in which to form an embryo. we also observed an increase in apoptosis, which we propose to be a consequence of and in response to extended delays in s-phase. despite the decreased number of cells and decreased size of the entire organism, mutant embryos are able to appropriately specify the neuro-ectodermal and mesodermal tissues that were queried. the typical consequence of folate deficiency is megaloblastic anemia, an enlargement of red blood cells, due to the failure of cellular division of erythrocyte precursors. our data support the idea that in rapidly dividing hematopoietic or embryonic cells, dna synthesis is susceptible before purine synthesis and other cellular methylation reactions. low folate status and hyperhomocysteinemia have been implicated as potentially reversible risk factors for cognitive decline and cardiovascular disease. our work establishes zebrafish as a model system for studying the folate pathway and demonstrates that zebrafish can serve as a model organism for studying the role of folate in development in order to understand the genetic and environmental etiology underlying some neural tube and congenital heart defects.
