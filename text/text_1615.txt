BACKGROUND
short ) non-coding rnas  generally appear to function through protein complexes. a number of such complexes are known to operate in various essential cellular functions . short ncrnas of unknown function are being detected in increasing numbers in a variety of organisms  <cit> . cloning of c. elegans short ncrnas identified  <dig> novel transcripts of which 31% could not be ascribed to any previously known class of rnas  <cit> , while a recent tiling microarray analysis indicated the existence of approximately  <dig> additional short transcripts for which sequence and secondary structure analysis revealed few clues to their cellular functions  <cit> .

rna interference  is a post-transcriptional sequence-specific gene silencing mechanism whose practical application was first demonstrated in c. elegans  <cit> . tests in our lab  suggest that c. elegans short ncrnas are recalcitrant to knock-down by rnai, irrespective of ncrna class or mode of rnai application, thereby rendering unavailable a potentially efficient tool for functional analysis of such transcripts. it was observed, though, that rnai depletion of individual protein components of ncrna complexes in a number of cases would also substantially reduce the expression levels of the associated ncrnas. such effects have been reported for small nucleolar rnas  in yeast  <cit> , and a similar approach has been used to analyse the potential involvement of telomerase rna in human cancers  <cit> . as the majority of known short ncrnas appear to act through ribonucleoprotein complexes, we hypothesised that this effect could be employed to identify novel ncrna-protein interactions which in turn might lead towards elucidating ncrna functions. if proteins belonging to specific complexes or pathways are depleted by rnai, which in c. elegans can be easily achieved by feeding worms with e. coli expressing double-stranded rna  corresponding to fragments of the targeted protein gene, effects on the ncrna population can be observed with a specifically designed microarray, and ncrna-protein interactions subsequently inferred from the reduced expression levels of associated ncrnas. to test the feasibility of this approach, we depleted each protein associated with both classes of snornas, and observed the effect with a microarray  <cit>  containing probes against  <dig> c. elegans short ncrnas . approximately  <dig> snornas are known in this organism, but very few studies have specifically addressed c. elegans snornas. therefore, in addition to serving as a pilot project for the possible analysis of the full short ncrna complement in c. elegans  through rnai knock-down of candidate protein components of ncrnps, the study should also provide further details on the worm snorna-protein relationship. furthermore, the study will contribute to correct annotation of transcripts with indistinct snorna characteristics, an issue that was raised in a recent study  <cit> .

small nucleolar rnas are a class of ncrnas that function in site-specific 2'-o-ribose methylation  and pseudouridylation  of rrnas. the two snorna subclasses associate with specific sets of proteins to form snornps, each of which consists of a c/d box or a h/aca box guide rna and four associated c/d box or h/aca box snornp proteins. the h/aca box snornas are composed of two hairpins of varying length separated by short single-strand regions  <cit> , and associate with four different evolutionary conserved core proteins, the pseudouridylase cbf <dig> , nhp <dig>  nop <dig> and gar <dig>  <cit> . the c/d box snornas contain two conserved sequence elements, boxes c  and d , that are positioned at the 5' and 3' ends of the molecules, respectively  <cit> , and are often flanked by short complementary regions that form short double-stranded stem structures, thought to bring the two boxes in closer proximity  <cit> . the c/d box snornps are also composed of four core proteins, namely the snu <dig>  nop <dig>  nop <dig> and nop <dig>   <cit> .

as additional controls we also used rnai to knock down protein components of the signal recognition particle  and the y rnp, and observed the effect of this on srp  rna and y rna respectively, by northern analysis. the srp is an rnp complex consisting of srp rna and six different proteins  <cit>  involved in directing nascent peptide chains to the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . the y rna is associated with the ro <dig> and la proteins  <cit> , and appears to play a role in rrna quality control  <cit> .

RESULTS
in order to observe the effects on the ncrna expression levels, we carried out rnai against protein components of the corresponding ncrnps. pcr fragments of the targeted ncrnp protein genes were cloned into the l <dig> plasmid, which induces synthesis of the corresponding dsrna fragments when transformed into e. coli ht <dig> . results of the rnais performed against protein components of ncrnps were observed on the c. elegans phenotype and through northern blots and microarray analysis of the expression levels of the corresponding mrnas and of both cognate and non-cognate ncrnas.

depletion of snorna associated proteins produce distinct phenotypes
at first we investigated the effects of down-regulation of the c/d box snorna proteins, snu <dig>  nop <dig>  nop <dig> and nop <dig>  rnai against each of the four c/d box snornp proteins produced distinct phenotypes. depletion of nop <dig>  thought to be the methyltransferase  <cit> , resulted in a majority of the worms  showing a sterile phenotype similar to what had been previously reported in worms  <cit> . depletion of snu <dig> resulted in 100% larval lethal worms, also in accordance with former investigations  <cit> . depletion of nop <dig> and nop <dig> produced worms with ~80% and ~95% sterile phenotypes, respectively. most of these sterile worms  also showed protruding bulges of varying size located at the vulva. when sterile worms with and without protruding bulges were examined under high magnification, it was observed that both types of worms lacked eggs. previous nop <dig> and nop <dig> depletion studies in c. elegans also resulted in sterile phenotypes and protruding vulvas  <cit> . depletion of snu <dig>  nop <dig> and nop <dig> in yeast also yielded distinct phenotypes  <cit> . it is likely that the phenotypes obtained for the down-regulated proteins are the result of the inability to assemble a functional snornp complex  <cit> , and not a specific effect of reduced ncrna expression levels . for each down-regulated c/d box snornp gene, total rna was extracted after  <dig> hours of feeding. northern blots were performed to confirm the rnai depletion of the c/d box snornp mrna genes compared with control worms .

similarly, depletion of each of the h/aca box snornp components nop <dig>  cbf <dig>  nhp <dig> and gar <dig> produced distinct phenotypes. in the case of cbf <dig>  the pseudouridine synthase  <cit>  of the complex, ~60â€“70% of the worms were found to be sterile after  <dig> hours of feeding with dsrna synthesizing e. coli. previous studies in which cbf <dig> was depleted yielded an abnormal phenotype in yeast  <cit>  and a sterile phenotype in c. elegans  <cit> , while reduced expression of the human cbf <dig> homologue dyskerin leads to the condition dyskeratosis congenita  <cit> . depletion of the nhp <dig> protein resulted in 100% of worms with slow growth rates, in agreement with previous studies in c. elegans  <cit> . similarly, rnai down-regulation of the remaining two genes  also produced approximately 95% and 80% sterile worms respectively, after  <dig> hours of feeding, demonstrating the essential role played by these two proteins  <cit> . previous nop <dig> and gar <dig> depletion studies in c. elegans also produced a sterile phenotype  <cit> . for each target protein gene  northern analysis confirmed a strong reduction in mrna levels , and it is reasonable to think that the obtained phenotypes may be a consequence of a loss of function of the targeted protein  rather than an effect of the reduction of any specific ncrna .

snornp depletions specifically reduces snorna expression levels
we then investigated the effect of rnai against snornp mrnas on the snorna expression levels. for this purpose, total rna was extracted at equal time intervals after depletion of each of the snornp component proteins. northern analyses of four snornas showed that the levels of both c/d box and h/aca box snornas fell considerably after depletion of several of their respective protein components of snornps . to make sure that such effects are not limited to snornas, we also depleted protein components of the signal recognition particle  and y rnp and observed the impact on srp rna and y rna expression levels, respectively. for both rnps, depletion of several of the protein components substantially reduced the expression level of the corresponding ncrna .

gene expression profiling using microarrays allows for the study of changes in the rna levels of a large number of genes simultaneously, and we have previously developed a microarray system for profiling the expression of most known c. elegans ncrnas, including snornas  <cit> . analysis employing this microarray showed that the levels of both c/d box and h/aca box snornas fell considerably after depletion of several of the protein components of their respective snornps . the effects on the u snrnas, srp rna and rnase p  were negligible . as is clearly visible from the microarray data, there were no effects of depletion of protein components of snornps on the opposite type of snorna expression levels; i.e. depletion of protein components of c/d box snornps did not affect the expression levels of h/aca box snornas, and vice versa .

relative expression was calculated as treated sample /control . statistical significance was calculated using a two tailed student t-test.

a "other ncrnas" include srp rna, rnase p rna and unclassified ncrnas.

the data agrees over all with a number of small-scale studies reported in the literatures  <cit> . with regards to the h/aca box snornas, depletion of gar <dig> appears to have no effect on their expression levels , despite a distinct phenotype and clearly reduced mrna levels . this is in accordance with previous studies  <cit>  and likely reflects the peripheral position of the gar <dig> in the h/aca box snornp particle, revealed by structural studies in archaea  <cit>  and eukaryotes  <cit> , and is also true for c. elegans. however, consistently negative effects on the h/aca box snorna expression levels after depletion of nop <dig> were unexpected. nop <dig> knock-down is known to affect h/aca transcript levels in yeast  <cit> . however, structural studies do not support a very central position in the h/aca box snornp particle for this protein  <cit> . whereas the effect of nop <dig> depletion might be an experimental artefact, the possibility remains for a structural configuration of the nematode h/aca box snornp particle with nop <dig> having a more central position than in other studied organisms. rnai against the larger, pseudouridinylase cbf <dig> had a less pronounced  effect on h/aca box snorna levels in the microarray, possibly due to incomplete depletion of this protein.

depletion of the protein components of c/d box snornps resulted in a marked and consistent reduction in the expression levels of nearly all transcripts annotated as c/d box snornas for proteins snu <dig> and nop <dig> . these results are similar to findings deriving from analogous experiments on nop <dig> and snu <dig> performed in yeast  <cit> . on the other hand, depletion of nop <dig> appears to have no effect on c/d box snorna expression levels , despite a distinct phenotype and a reduction in nop <dig> mrna levels. nop <dig> has been reported to be dispensable for c/d box snorna stability in yeast  <cit>  and our result is in accordance with this study. moreover, the effect of rnai against nop <dig> on the c/d box snorna expression levels was slightly weaker  than that observed on snu <dig> and nop <dig>  which may be due to incomplete depletion of the protein, as also indicated by the mrna northern blot results  and the lower frequency of worms  with a distinct phenotype.

despite maintaining certain common sequence and secondary structure elements, snornas are quite variable in size, sequence and structure, and hence one may expect this variation to translate into differential affinities for the different protein components of the snornps, and consequently into differential effects of the individual protein depletions. however, the relative response to depletion of the different proteins were consistent across individual snornas . we also analysed specific sequence and structural features of the individual snornas, but found no systematic variable that might explain their overall differential reactions to depletions protein components of the snornps.

snorna annotation
the classification of small non-coding transcripts such as snornas, primarily depends on secondary structure characteristics and short sequence motifs, both of which can be quite variable, and therefore classification of a number of ncrnas has recently been questioned  <cit> . specific snorna expression reduction after depletion of protein components of the snornps might therefore also be used to support  previous classifications of the c. elegans small ncrna complement. although snorna annotations and the microarray data were in sound agreement, two of the  <dig> transcripts annotated as h/aca box snornas and four of the  <dig> annotated c/d box snornas did not cluster with the assumed snorna category . the two unsupported h/aca box snornas  were not only unaffected by depletion of protein components of the h/aca box snornps, but rather showed reduced expression levels after depletion of protein components of c/d box snornps, supporting a recent claim that one of these  belongs to the c/d box snorna sub-class  <cit> . similarly, among the four unsupported c/d box snornas, two  actually clustered with the h/aca box snornas, whereas the remaining two  displayed expression profiles that were untypical of both snorna categories.

effects on non-snornas
whereas the expression levels of spliceosomal u snrnas were generally not influenced by depletion of protein components of the snornps, the expression levels of two other groups of ncrnas showed more marked effects. one of these groups is sm y rnas  <cit>  , of which five  out of the eight transcripts represented on the microarray showed reduced expression levels after the depletion of protein components of the c/d box snornps , while generally remaining stable after depletion protein components of the of h/aca box snornps. this is an unexpected outcome, as sm y rnas are defined by the presence of an sm protein binding element within their sequences, an element commonly found in spliceosomal snrnas, and at least one sm y rna has been shown to associate with proteins in the spliceosomal apparatus  <cit> . the c. elegans transcript annotated as c/d box snorna u <dig>  <cit>  also contains an sm protein binding element and behaves as a typical c/d box snorna in the microarray . the possibility that a few  of the sm y rna transcripts may have been wrongly annotated and hence may possibly belong to the class of c/d box snornas has been suggested  <cit> . however, sm y rnas appear to be a rather numerous class, with  <dig> verified loci  <cit>  and possibly up to  <dig> putative loci  <cit> ) found thus far, of which only  <dig> are represented on the present microarray. although it is still possible that some of these transcripts might have been wrongly annotated, actually being c/d box snornas, their distinct sm protein binding elements and preserved upstream sequence motifs  <cit>  might lead to the assumption that a number of c. elegans non-codingtranscripts may have sequence characteristics common to both snrnas and snornas. this may reflect some aspect of the complex trans-splicing operations of nematode mrna and operon processing  <cit> .

the other group of ncrnas with a marked response were the recently identified stem-bulge rnas , of which four transcripts  showed strongly increased expression levels after depletion of the protein components of the snornps . no sbrna showed reduced expression with the knock down of any of the c/d box and h/aca box associated proteins .

the expression pattern of previously unclassified ncrnas was also analysed. the microarray data showed that out of  <dig> unclassified ncrnas, two transcripts  reacted similarly to annotated h/aca box snornas while another six  revealed a reduced expression after c/d box snornps depletion . secondary structure analysis of these ncrnas further supports the classification indicated by the microarray data . one ncrna  remained stable after depletion of all snornps and it is most likely not functionally related to snornas.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study demonstrates that one can feasibly combine rnai knock-down of known or potential protein components of ncrnps with microarray analysis to detect ncrna-protein interactions. in lieu of an efficient rnai methodology for short ncrnas depletion, this methodology may thus be utilized to elucidate functional properties of the rapidly increasing number of small transcripts identified in whole genome mapping approaches . the study also confirms the observation that removal of protein components of snornps may strongly reduce expression of the corresponding class of snornas also applies in c. elegans, and that this reduction in expression is experienced across entire sets of related transcripts. in addition, the analysis indicates that despite considerable variation in size, sequence and secondary structure characteristics commonly found within a given category of transcripts  their affinity for the core proteins component of the ncrnps is not systematically affected.
