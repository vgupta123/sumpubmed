BACKGROUND
ketogenesis is a common metabolic pathway to provide energy to dairy cows during early lactation; however the synthesis of large amounts of ketone bodies  may result in a typical metabolic disorder denominated ketosis  <cit> . several studies have shown that high levels of bhba are associated with increased risk of periparturient diseases, losses in milk yield and impaired fertility  <cit> . in addition, increased concentrations of bhba were associated with greater milk fat and lower milk protein percentages in the first dairy herd improvement test day of lactation  <cit> .

conjugated linoleic acid  is one component of milk fat that might be beneficial to human health due to anticarcinogenic properties  <cit> . however, this potential benefit has been described for only few isomers of cla, especially for those called cla cis- <dig>  tans- <dig>  strategies such as commercial sources of cla added into dairy cattle diets is one potential means of increasing cla content of milk  <cit> . conversely, there might be several factors decreasing the levels of cla in milk such as feeding excessive grains , corn silage and products rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids   <cit> . as stated previously, the association of high levels of ketone bodies and greater milk fat percentage in dairy cattle has been reported  <cit> . however, these studies did not evaluate fatty acid  profile in milk. the hypothesis of this study was that there is a relationship between bhba levels and fa profile of milk in early lactation holstein cows. the objective of this study was to determine the association of plasma concentrations of bhba and fa profile of milk with special emphasis in cla in early lactation holstein cows.

RESULTS
the median value of bhba concentration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol/l. twenty six cows were classified as having a plasma concentration of bhba of ≤ a  <dig>  mmol/l and  <dig> cows as having a plasma concentration of bhba of >  <dig>  mmol/l. the reason for using the median value as cut-off point was to develop two groups with comparable number of animals. when the cut-off for subclinical ketosis of  <dig>  mmol/l of bhba  <cit>  was considered, only  <dig> cows  were above this concentration, and  <dig> cows were below this value; consequently there was not sufficient statistical power to conduct the analysis.

for all study variables  the interaction of group by parity was not significant; therefore only main effects are reported. the milk fat content  of cows with high and low bhba was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively . consequently, there was a tendency for milk fat content to be higher in the group of cows with bhba >  <dig>  mmol/l. this is in agreement with the study conducted by duffield et al  <cit>  where cows with higher levels of bhba had higher concentration of milk fat than cows with low levels of bhba. this association might be reasonable since bhba is used as precursor for milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland. short- and medium-chain fa  and a portion of the 16-carbon fa are derived from de novo synthesis from acetate and to a lesser extent butyrate  <cit> . conversely, preformed fa that account for the remaining 16-carbon and all of the longer-chain fa  are taken up from the circulating plasma pool. these long fa originate from absorption from the digestive tract or mobilization from body reserves. adipose tissue mobilization accounts for less than 10 % of preformed fa in milk fat, except during periods of negative energy balance when their proportion increases substantially  <cit> .

in table  <dig>  the least squared mean concentration and sem of milk fa  of both group is presented. an interesting finding of this study was that the concentration of cla in milk in cows with bhba ≤  <dig>  mmol/l was higher than in cows with levels of bhba >  <dig>  mmol/l . differences were also found for 18: <dig> . in addition, results from the multivariate regression model  show there was a tendency that for each  <dig>  mmol/l of bhba in plasma, cla  decreased in  <dig>  g/kg of total fat . this association was established correcting for milk yield, solid contents, somatic cell counts and milk urea nitrogen. the total r  <dig> for the predicting equation was  <dig> , indicating that 59 % of the variation of cla in milk was explained by the current model. the partial slope for bhba was essentially linear, without evidence of polynomial effects. fatty acid metabolism in the rumen has a major influence on the fa profile in milk  <cit> . the cla are present at higher concentrations in ruminant products because they are formed in the rumen from dietary linoleic and linolenic acid. this transformation is due to via three major processes carried out by rumen microbes: lipolysis, biohydrogenation and isomerization. these mechanisms are dependent on the type and amount of fat entering the rumen  <cit>  and ruminal ph  <cit> . the question arising is why levels of blood bhba >  <dig>  mmol/l might be negatively related to cla in milk. bhba is synthesized in the liver through the process of ketogenesis  <cit>  and in the rumen through butyrate-producing bacteria  <cit> . in addition, all bacteria that produced substantial quantities of cis- <dig>  trans-11-cla, trans-11-18: <dig>  or both from linoleic acid were butyrate producers . however, not all butyrate producers yield cis- <dig>  trans-11-cla or trans-11-18: <dig>  other source of cla is cell membrane from protozoa. protozoa contained at least  <dig> to  <dig> times more unsaturated fa than bacteria. these unsaturated fa included cla and trans-11-18: <dig>  which were more than 8- and 3-fold more abundant in protozoa than in bacteria, respectively. as a result, the flow of fa from protozoa accounted for between  <dig> and 43 % of the cla and 40 % of the trans-11-18: <dig> reaching the duodenum  <cit> . the contribution of protozoa to the flows of 16: <dig> and 18: <dig> to the duodenum was less than  <dig> and 10 %, respectively. although protozoa do not themselves produce cla and trans-11-18: <dig> by their own metabolism; they might be expected to have a significant influence on cla and trans-11-18: <dig> available to the host animal  <cit> . in this sense, the content of cla in milk is explained by several highly complex mechanisms. since butyrate is precursor for short and medium chain milk fa it is reasonable to suggest that higher concentrations of blood butyrate would increase milk fat through fatty acids <  <dig> c; and would decrease proportionally long chain fatty acids. this is partially true, because in the present study most of short and medium chain fa, and 18: <dig> were higher in cows with bhba >  <dig>  mmol/l than in cows with bhba ≤  <dig>  mmol/l. accordingly, even though, trans- <dig> c18: <dig> and cis- <dig>  trans- <dig> cla are the predominant trans fa intermediates produced from the ruminal metabolism of linoleic acid; ruminal biohydrogenation pathways are dynamic, allowing the production of a wide range of positional and geometric isomers as well as modified fa such as hydroxy and keto derivatives  <cit> .table  <dig> least squared mean concentration and sem of milk fa in cows with bhba plasma concentrations ≤  <dig>  mmol/l  and >  <dig>  mmol/l a



aall models included the effect of parity  and farm ; consequently reported least squared means for all fatty acids are adjusted for these two variables. for all fa, the interaction between group and parity was not significant



finally, if the negative association between levels of bhba in blood and proportion of cla in milk remain consistent in further studies, especially in cows with high levels of bhba , it would be another reason to consider essential the prevention of high levels of ketone bodies, if the dairy industry is looking for milk and its derivatives with high levels of cla.

CONCLUSIONS
early postpartum cows with plasma bhba >  <dig>  mmol/l tended to have higher milk fat content and significantly lower proportion of cla than early postpartum cows with bhba ≤  <dig>  mmol/l. for each  <dig>  mmol/l of bhba in plasma, cla  decreased in  <dig>  g/kg of total fat.
