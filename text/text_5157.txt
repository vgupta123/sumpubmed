BACKGROUND
the gram-negative anaerobic rod morganella morganii is the only species in the genus morganella, which belongs to the tribe proteeae of the family enterobacteriaceae. the other genera in the tribe proteeae are proteus and providencia. species belonging to morganella, proteus, and providencia are found in the environment and as part of the normal flora of humans. they are also important opportunistic pathogens, which cause a wide variety of nosocomial infections following surgery. reports of individual cases of infection and nosocomial-outbreaks have revealed that infection with m. morganii can lead to major clinical problems, which are usually associated with common causes of catheter-associated bacteriuria, infections of the urinary and hepatobiliary tracts  <cit> , wound infection, and septicaemia  <cit> . a few devastating infections with m. morganii that were associated with a high mortality rate following bacteraemia sepsis and/or nosocomial infection have also been reported, although most of such infections respond well to appropriate antibiotic therapy  <cit> .

although m. morganii was formerly classified as proteus morganii  <cit> , it was later assigned to the genus morganella on the basis of dna-dna hybridisation results  <cit> . members of the genus can ferment trehalose, and express lysine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase  <cit> .

like other members of the enterobacteriaceae, m. morganii has a natural resistance to β-lactam antibiotics  <cit> . many strains of m. morganii are resistant to the drugs cefazolin, cefixime, cefpodoxime, and ampicillin  <cit> . members of the tribe proteeae, which include proteus, providencia and m. morganii share homologous genes acquired from horizontal gene transfer via conjugative integration or mobile transposition  <cit> . the drug resistance of m. morganii was introduced via extra genetic elements  <cit>  and/or mobile elements  <cit> . the resistant strains that carry blactx-m gene are capable of producing β-lactamases  <cit> , which can break down the extended spectrum β-lactam drugs  <cit> .

complicated urinary tract infections, especially those associated with long-term catheterisation may be caused by polymicrobes, as well as biofilm formation. in addition to m. morganii, escherichia coli, p. mirabilis, providencia stuartii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently cause urinary tract infections  <cit> . like p. mirabilis, m. morganii is motile, with peritrichous flagellar. the flagella-encoding genes are located in a contiguous manner in a single locus of the p. mirabilis genome  <cit> . besides flagella, adherence is another major determinant of bacterial colonisation and biofilm formation. several fimbriae have also been shown to play important roles in establishing complicated urinary tract infections  <cit> . they are type- <dig> fimbriae, mannose-resistant/proteus-like  fimbriae, uroepithelial cell adhesin , type- <dig> fimbriae, and p. mirabilis fimbriae .

the production of urease has a fitness factor that influences bacterial growth and biofilm formation during urinary tract infections. other virulence factors may include iron acquisition systems, type- <dig> secretion system , two-component systems , proteins that function in immune evasion , and haemolysins  <cit> .

the environment found in the guts of nematodes or insects may be an important determinant of bacterial pathogenicity  <cit> . ethanolamine, which is abundant in human diets and the intestinal tracts of humans, can be used by gut bacteria as a source of carbon and/or nitrogen  <cit> . the association between the use of ethanolamine and the virulence of various pathogens has been reported  <cit> .

phylogenetic assessment of 16s rrna sequences indicates that p. mirabilis is the closest relative of m. morganii. only one complete protues genome sequence and four draft sequences of providencia spp. are available.

here we report the draft genome sequence of a clinical isolate of m. morganii and the results of its bioinformatic analysis to enhance understanding of m. morganii biology. comparative analysis of the sequences with the sequences of other proteeae and enterobacteriaceae genomes identifies potential virulence determinants, which may provide new drug targets.

RESULTS
epidemiological study of m. morganii infection
over a 6-year period , samples were collected from all patients at changhua christian hospital, taiwan, who presented with symptoms of gram-negative bacterial infections. of  <dig>  samples,  <dig>   were positive for m. morganii and  <dig>   were positive for proteus spp. as shown in table  <dig>  m. morganii was ranked between the eighth and fourteenth most prevalent gram-negative bacterial species isolated from the hospital over  <dig> consecutive 6-month intervals during the  <dig> years of the study.

the frequency of infection by  <dig> bacterial species was monitored over 6-month intervals  and ranked such that  <dig> denotes the species most frequently associated with bacterial infection. the column heading '# infections' represents the total number of patients infected with the species indicated. na: data not available, not significant to the ranking list.

the kt strain of m. morganii was isolated from the blood of a patient who developed sepsis during postoperative care. the kt strain was found to be susceptible to amikacin, ertapenem, gentamicin, meropenem, and cefepime but resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefmetazole, flomoxef, and cefotaxime.

general features of the m. morganii draft genome
the genome of the m. morganii strain kt, which carries no plasmids, was assembled de novo into  <dig> contigs , which together comprised  <dig> , <dig> bp with a gc content of  <dig> %. the largest contig is  <dig>  bp long, and the n <dig> statistic  is  <dig>  bp, with pair-end short read sequencing coverage > <dig> -fold. seven small contigs  had low-depth reads , whereas two pairs and one triad shared high sequence identity with minor differences at their ends . the origin of replication assigned on the basis of the gc-skew analysis together with the location of the dnaa gene and dnaa boxes of the genome lies between gida  and mioc  .

as shown in table  <dig>  comparison of the m. morganii sequences with the complete genome of p. mirabilis hi <dig> revealed a  <dig> % difference in gc-content of the two species .

the draft genome of m. morganii strain kt were de novo assembled into  <dig> contigs , the n <dig> contig size is  <dig>  bp, , which together comprised  <dig> , <dig> bp with gc content of  <dig> %. p. mirabilis hi <dig> chromosome has total  <dig> , <dig> bp and g+c content of  <dig> %  <cit> .

database searches identified  <dig>  predicted coding sequences . among them,  <dig>  cdss could be placed into clusters of orthologous groups with assigned biological functions, and  <dig> transposes have also predicted. as p. mirabilis identified  <dig>  predicted cdss,  <dig>  could placed into clusters of orthologous groups and have  <dig> transposes predicted.

m. morganii have predicted  <dig> trnas, as p. mirabilis have  <dig> trnas. m. morganii have one 16s rrna, one  <dig> srrna, and eight 5s rrna were predicted, further analysis of contigs revealed that the 16s rrna had a read depth of  <dig> -fold and that the 23s rrna had a read depth of  <dig> -fold.

sequences that encode eight 5s rrnas, one 16s rrna, and one 23s rrna were identified using the ribosomal rna scan application in rnammer  . further analysis of contigs revealed that the 16s rrna had a read depth of  <dig> -fold and that the 23s rrna had a read depth of  <dig> -fold .

database searches identified  <dig>  predicted coding sequences . among them,  <dig>  cdss could be placed into clusters of orthologous groups with assigned biological functions . the proteins annotated as pathogenicity and fitness factors are listed in table  <dig>  with additional information in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  8: supplementary tables 2- <dig> 

metallo-β-lactamases  mm <dig>  mm <dig>  and mm <dig> 
tellurite resistance operon mm933- <dig> 

m. morganii has longest ethanolamine utilization  operon, eutspqtdmnejghabclk-pdust-eutr which consists of  <dig> genes.

the two novel genes in eut of m. morganii kt, pdut and pdus, were found orthologous protein from pdu operon from other species. sequence identity of best top three hits ranging from  <dig> to 87% and species were varied. abbreviation of species were eco: escherichia coli; eb: enterobacteriaceae bacterium; ko: klebsiella oxytoca; ss: shigella sonnei; sb: shigella boydii; se: salmonella enterica; yi: yerisinia intermedia; yr: yokenella regensburgei; ecl: enterobacter cloacae; cy: citrobacter youngae; ck: citrobacter koseri; ta: tolumonas auensis; ha: hafnia alvei; pa: photorhabdus asymbiotica. id  represent percent of identify compare two orthologous proteins.

prophages and mobile elements
bacteriophages and transposons, which may contribute to genome plasticity  <cit> , are, in general, laterally acquired elements  <cit> . in the m. morganii genome,  <dig> prophages  and  <dig> degenerate prophages together comprise  <dig> prophage-related genes . the prophage  <dig> genes were also found in the genome of proteus mirabilis, providencia alcalifaciens, and providencia rustigianii, whereas the prophage  <dig> genes are orthologous to those found in the other  <dig> enterobacteriaceae genomes.

neither the integrated conjugative element icepm <dig>  nor ice/r <dig>  was found in m. morganii strain kt. however, several integrase recognition sequences, including prfc  and two trna phev sites , are present in the strain kt genome.

drug resistance
a chromosomally encoded β-lactamase from m. morganii has been cloned  <cit> . the clinical strains with high or low levels of cephalosporinase expression were found to harbour the adjacent ampc  and ampr  genes, which are flanked by the hybf and orf- <dig> genes  <cit> . the ampc and ampr genes produce both broad-spectrum and the ampc β-lactamases or only the ampc β-lactamase  <cit> . in providencia spp., the production of metallo-β-lactamases has been associated with resistance to carbapenems  <cit> . the m. morganii kt strain also contains the gene encoding β-lactamase, which confers resistance to aminopenicillins. genes that encode three metallo-β-lactamases  were found. moreover, the m. morganii genome also encodes the tetracycline resistant protein tetaj  and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cata <dig> .

other drug resistance genes include a tellurite resistance operon , the bicyclomycin  resistance gene bcr , a catb3-like putative acetyltransferase gene , and a kasugamycin resistance gene ksga . the tellurite resistance ter operon was also identified in p. mirabilis hi <dig>  p. stuartii atcc#  <dig>  k. pneumoniae ntuh k <dig>  e. coli o157:h <dig>  and e. coli apec o <dig>  the genes involved in multidrug efflux and the cdss predicted to confer antimicrobial resistance are listed in additional file 10: supplementary table  <dig> 

fimbriae, pili, and adhesion proteins
as shown in table  <dig>  eight potential chaperone-usher fimbrial operons were identified. among them, three were previously identified as the operons that encode the components of the mr/p, uca , and pmf  fimbriae  <cit> . an apparent duplicate of the mrp operon immediately adjacent to mrpj was designated mrp' . this is similar to the duplicated operon present in p. mirabilis, albeit with different annotation and orientation of the constituent genes  <cit> . interestingly, the m. morganii genome contains  <dig> paralogues of mrpj, which encodes a transcriptional regulator that represses motility  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  two mrpj genes were associated with each of the fimbrial operons.

together with the hofc  and hofb  genes, four genes, namely ppda , ppdb , ppdc , and ppdd , are involved in the assembly of type-iv pili. two genes that encode putative trimeric autotransporter adhesins  are homologues of proteins found in p. stuartii atcc#  <dig> and y. enterocolitica  <dig> 

motility and chemotaxis systems
fifty three genes that encode proteins required for flagellar structure  and eight chemotaxis-related genes  are contained in the m. morganii genome. with the exception of the genes that encode two lysr family transcriptional regulators , the camphor resistance protein crcb and related genes , a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase sdr , and the three insecticidal toxin complex proteins encoded by xpta1a1c <dig> , the organisation of flagellar genes is similar to that of p. mirabilis.

the genes that flank the locus that encodes flagellar structural proteins encode a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein  and an aerotaxis protein . genes that encode regulators of flagellar motility, such as umoa , umob , umoc , umod , rssba , and the rcsbcd phosphorelay regulatory system , were also identified.

iron acquisition
the m. morganii genome encodes the hmustuv haeme uptake system , the afuabc system for ferric and ferrous iron transport , feoab , the ferric siderophore receptor locus irea , the b <dig> transporter locus btucd , btub , and the siderophore iron uptake systems yfedcba  to circumvent host iron-sequestering mechanisms. a possible haeme-binding system is encoded by mm <dig> and mm <dig>  a gene that encodes a putative iron receptor  is located adjacent to a fecr homologue . there are two other iron-related abc transporters  and  <dig> additional tonb-dependent receptors .

zinc acquisition
the znuacb high-affinity zinc transporter system was recently shown to be a fitness factor for e. coli and p. mirabilis during experimental urinary tract infection  <cit> . the system is encoded by m. morganii gene products mm <dig> through mm <dig> 

type iii secretion system
a t3ss, which comprises gene products mm <dig> through mm <dig> and has a low gc-content , resides in a  <dig> -kb pathogenicity island. this island of  <dig> genes, which shares homologous syntenic blocks with p. mirabilis  <cit> , contains all the components needed to assemble a t3ss needle complex. except for the genes that encode effector proteins, the most homologous proteins were orthologues from p. mirabilis . a putative ipacbd operon, which encodes chaperones for three proteins  was also found. the ipac and ipad proteins have low similarity  to those of p. mirabilis, whereas the ipab protein has the highest homology with ipab of p. mirabilis but low similarity  with that of shigella spp. and salmonella enterica subsp.

two-component systems
nineteen potential tcs were identified. these include the quorum sensors qsebc , yedwv , and bara/uhpa of the luxr family . nineteen orthologues that encode tcs components were identified in p. mirabilis hi <dig>  <cit> , p. alcalifaciens nctc 10286; r <dig>  p. rettgeri dsm#  <dig>  p. rustigianii dsm#  <dig>  enterobacter aerogenes kctc  <dig>  photorhabdus luminescens laumondii tto <dig>  and y. enterocolitica  <dig> 

regulation
analysis of the m. morganii genome identified seven sigma factor subunits of rna polymerase. these are the major sigma factor rpod  encoded by mm <dig>  and six alternative sigma factors: rpoh  encoded by mm <dig>  rpon  encoded by mm <dig> to control promoters for nitrogen assimilation, rpos  encoded by mm <dig> to activate stationary-phase promoters, rpoe  encoded by mm <dig> to regulate extra-cytoplasmic stresses, rpof  encoded by mm <dig> to regulate flagellum-related functions, and a fecr family sigma factor encoded by mm <dig> 

the small rna regulatory gene ryhb found in e. coli and p. mirabilis  <cit> , which regulates a set of iron-storage and iron-usage proteins, is present in only a single copy .

iga protease
the zapa gene encodes a zinc metalloprotease that cleaves a broad range of host proteins, including serum and secretory iga <dig>  iga <dig> and igg, complement proteins, and antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . whereas the m. morganii kt, p. mirabilis hi <dig>  and p. luminescens laumondii tto <dig> genomes all encode zapabcd , the p. mirabilis hi <dig> genome encodes zapeeeabcd  <cit> .

lipopolysaccharide and the cell capsule
lipopolysaccharide , the main structural component of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria, consists of a lipid a molecule and a variable o-antigen. lipid a released during bacterial lysis induces endotoxic shock. several o-specific polysaccharides of m. morganii have been investigated  <cit> , and at least  <dig> o-antigens have been identified  <cit> . the genes predicted to be involved in the synthesis of lps and the enterobacterial common antigen  <cit>  are listed in additional file 6: supplementary table  <dig>  four genes, rcsb , rcsc , rcsd , and rcsf , are implicated in the regulation of capsule synthesis.

immunity-like system
clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats consist of multiple short nucleotide repeats, which are separated by unique spacer sequences flanked by characteristic sets of crispr-associated genes  <cit> . the crispr-associated proteins mm <dig>  mm <dig>  and mm <dig> were identified downstream of the degenerate prophage # <dig>  comparison of the m. morganii genome with that of the other  <dig> members of the enterobacteriaceae analysed revealed orthologues in the pathogens p. stuartii atcc#  <dig>  e. coli uti <dig>  and e. coli apec o <dig>  all of which have been implicated in causing urinary tract infections  <cit> .

haemolysins
the gene hmpa, encoding a secreted haemolysin, was originally identified in uropathogenic isolates  <cit> . the two partner genes, hmpba, encoding secreted proteins that are highly conserved in p. mirabilis  <cit> , are encoded by mm <dig> and mm <dig> in m. morganii kt. functional similarity of the e. coli and m. morganii homologues of hmpba was reported previously  <cit> .

urease hydrolysis and putrescine production
rapid urea hydrolysis is a prominent phenotype of proteeae organisms  <cit> . the urease enzyme is believed to be a cause of urinary stone formation  <cit> . the urease of m. morganii, which revealed a high degree of amino acid conservation to p. mirabilis urease, has been purified and characterised  <cit> . ureases from both m. morganii and p. mirabilis urease gene cluster are required for virulence  <cit> . the analysis revealed that the closest homologues of the members of the urease gene cluster ureabcefgd were the orthologues from yersinia pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica, with amino acid identities that ranged from 69% to 94%. unlike the urease gene cluster of p. mirabilis, the m. morganii genome has a gene that encodes the transporter mm <dig>  in addition to mm <dig> to mm <dig>  on the other hand, the p. mirabilis urer gene, which encodes a transcriptional activator, was not found in the genome.

the genome of m. morganii kt contains genes for two pathways involved in putrescine production. the first of these pathways involves ornithine decarboxylase, which is encoded by spef , and the putrescine transporter, which is encoded by pote . the enzymes in the second pathway, which are encoded by carab , argi , argg , argh , spea , and speb , also participate in urea production. all of the urease cluster genes that encode enzymes from both pathways have orthologues in p. mirabilis hi <dig>  <cit> .

toxins
several cdss that encode potential toxins were found. these include a gene that encodes the cytotoxin rtxa , the two xaxab genes  that encode apoptotic toxins, a putative intimin gene for host-cell invasion , a hlyd-family toxin scretion protein , and a transporter gene . among the nine insecticidal toxin-related genes , tccb, tcca, and tcdb <dig>  are orthologous to the insecticidal toxin genes of pseudomonas spp. the three other insecticidal toxin genes xpta1a1c <dig>  were identified in a continuous locus between the flagellum-related genes and chemotaxis genes.

ethanolamine utilisation system
the ethanolamine utilisation system, which is encoded by the eut operon it were found to vary substantially between species  <cit> , is composed of the genes eutspqtdmnejghabclk-pdust-eutr . this region carries two extra genes compared to the  <dig> eut genes found in other enterobacteriaceae genomes  <cit> . in addition, the gene organisation is unique, with pdust located between eutk and eutr. as shown in table  <dig>  the sequence similarities of the three most similar proteins ranged from 51% to 87%, and species varied.

the comparison revealed that the 17-gene operon is present in klebsiella pneumonia, e. coli, and salmonella enterica serovars. the pdu operon, a paralogous operon required for use of propanediol that is found in these three species, was not found in the m. morganii kt genome.

located upstream of the eut operon, mm <dig> through mm <dig> encode the enzymes of the cob-cbi operon, which is required for cobalamin  biosynthesis  <cit> . under aerobic conditions, the activity of eutbc depends on the exogenous supply of cobalamin.

other determinants of persistence of infection and fitness for infection
pathogenic bacteria produce superoxide dismutase to protect them from being killed by the reactive oxygen species generated by their hosts  <cit> . as shown in additional file 8: supplementary table  <dig>  the genes involved in countering superoxide stress are kata, soxs, sodc, sodb, oxyr, and soda.

the pspabc operon  encodes a phage-shock-protein , which ensures the survival of e. coli during late-stationary-phase stresses  <cit> .

prominent virulence and fitness factors in m. morganii kt--a comparison with enterobacteriaceae and proteeae genomes
sequence comparison between m. morganii kt and the  <dig> members of the enterobacteriaceae family, including  <dig> proteeae species ,  <dig> e. coli strains , k. pneumonia ntuh k <dig>  enterobacter aerogenes kctc  <dig>  photorhabdus luminescens laumondii tto <dig>  s. enterica serovars typhimurium lt <dig>  and y. enterocolitica  <dig>  revealed that  <dig> cdss found in m. morganii are not found in the other proteeae species studied, and  <dig> cdss found in m. morganii are not found in any of the  <dig> enterobacteriaceae genomes studied . the genes specific to m. morganii include the genes in the eut operon, cob-cbi operon,  <dig> insecticidal toxin genes,  <dig> t3ss genes, and  <dig> copies of the is <dig> family transposase gene.

among the orthologous genes,  <dig>  cdss were found in the genomes of the  <dig> proteeae species analysed, and  <dig>  cdss were found in the  <dig> enterobacteriaceae genomes analysed. as shown in additional file 11: supplementary table  <dig>  of the genomes analysed, that of p. rettgeri is the most closely related genome to that of m. morganii, sharing  <dig>  orthologous cdss. the orthologous genes encode proteins for drug resistance, pathogenicity , motility, iron acquisition, ethanolamine use, and urease production, as well as components of an immunity-like system  and fimbrial adhesins, toxins, and haemolysin.

discussion
epidemiological studies have revealed that m. morganii is frequently isolated from clinical specimens collected from patients with nosocomial bacterial infections  <cit> . strains of m. morganii that confirm the chromosomal origin of the plasmid-located cephalosporinases  <cit>  are now found throughout the world  <cit> . genes from m. morganii that encode cefotaxime-hydrolysing β-lactamases have also been reported with increasing frequency  <cit> . plasmid-borne drug resistance factors have also increased the virulence of m. morganii  <cit> . gene products that confer multidrug resistance, including metallo-β-lactamases and efflux pumps for tetracycline, tellurite, bicyclomycin, and kasugamycin, have been commonly reported for clinical isolates of m. morganii. in the event of an outbreak, this situation poses a potential threat owing to the absence of a proper antibiotic therapy.

compared with other members of the genus proteeae, which have gc contents that range from 39% to 43%, the gc content of m. morganii is 51%. which is genetically different from other species  <cit>  and therefore assigned to the genus morganella  <cit> . the plasmid-borne gene that encodes lysine decarboxylase was once used to classify bacteria  <cit> . however, the chromosomal gene that encodes ornithine decarboxylase was subsequently adopted as a characteristic feature to classify members of the genus morganella  <cit> .

information on the 16s rrna gene and paralogs in genome is important for evolution and bacterial population studies  <cit> . the p. mirabilis genome has seven rrna operons   <cit> . analysis of the m. morganii kt genome sequence revealed eight duplications of the 16s and 23s rrna genes while 5s rrna were also  <dig>  the prophage genes that were found in the other enterobacteriaceae species appeared to comprise 7% of the m. morganii genome.

interestingly, the icepm <dig> and ice/r <dig> genes, which are present in many p. mirabilis isolates  <cit> , are not found in strain kt. seventeen copies of transposase genes of the is <dig> family were not present in other proteeae genomes, which implies that different transposition events occurred during the evolution of m. morganii and of these species.

unlike the flagellar genes of p. mirabilis, m. morganii kt has lysr family transcriptional regulatory genes , genes mm <dig> through mm <dig> that encode the camphor resistance gene crcb and related proteins, a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase sdr gene , and the insecticidal toxin complex genes xpta1a1c <dig> .

both m. morganii kt and p. mirabilis have duplicated mr/p fimbrial operons, albeit with different numbers of genes  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  whereas three copies of the mrpi recombinase gene are found in m. morganii kt, only one copy is in the p. mirabilis genome. in m. morganii kt, the mrp' operon is oriented opposite to mrpi, whereas mrpi is not present in the p. mirabilis mrp' operon.

more than half of the pathogenicity island genes are conserved and found to show collinear synteny between m. morganii and p. mirabilis. however, genes that encode components of t3sss have low sequence similarities.

edta-sensitive protease zap gene clusters have been found in many proteus spp. and e. coli clinical strains but are not produced by providencia spp. and morganella spp.  <cit> . the zapabcd genes found in m. morganii kt differ from those in p. mirabilis hi <dig> zapeeeabcd  <cit>  insofar as kt has an incomplete zape gene downstream of zapabcd. although the m. morganii urease shares a high degree of sequence similarity to p. mirabilis ureases, the presence of the unique transporter gene  and the absence of urer in m. morganii suggest that the two species use different systems to regulate urease transport.

although none of the insecticidal toxin genes were found in p. mirabilis, some were found in xenorhabdus  <cit> , pseudomonas  <cit> , yersinia, and photorhabdus  <cit> . in photorhabdus, the related toxin complex is released upon invasion of the nematode host  <cit> . why the m. morganii clinical isolate harbours eight insecticidal toxin genes remains to be investigated.

the urinary and hepatobiliary tracts are two major portals of entry for m. morganii  <cit> . compared with p. mirabilis hi <dig>  <cit> , m. morganii has fewer types of fimbriae  and fewer gene clusters . this implies that m. morganii may be less virulent than p. mirabilis in the context of urinary tract infections.

given that the intestine is thought to provide a rich source of ethanolamine  <cit> , the eut operon likely plays a critical role in enabling m. morganii, e. coli, klebsiella spp., and yersinia spp. to use ethanolamine as a source of carbon and/or nitrogen to colonise the intestine. however, the other proteeae genomes lack the eut operon and pduts, which together encode proteins that help to establish a microcompartment  <cit> , and the cob-cbi operon, which encodes the enzymes needed for cobalamin biosynthesis.

the eut operon, which includes pdust, and the cob-cbi operon likely provide the fitness factors required for colonisation by intestinal bacteria. this may explain why m. morganii is more frequently associated with nosocomial bacterial infections than other members of proteeae.

typically antibiotics target the essential cellular function, like cell-wall synthesis, ribosomal function, or dna replication  <cit> . the whole genome sequencing approaches of human hosts and pathogens facilitate the growing understanding of bacteria infectious disease mechanisms and help to reveal crucial host-pathogen interaction sites  <cit> . the pathogenicity genes allows usage of computation approaches to identify potential drug targets such as the conserved proteins found in common pathogens <cit> . t3sss is highly conserved in many disease-causing gram-negative pathogens and hence has been used as an alternative strategy for drug target design  <cit> . the efflux pumps which help to get rid of toxic substances also promote biofilms, thus making them attractive targets for antibiofilm measure  <cit> . in many bacteria, biofilm formation, siderophore production and adhesion activity are linked traits. therefore, drugs that could target bacterial adhesions while colonization could be therapeutically useful  <cit> . selective toxicity is another antibiotics approach, which aims to have highly effective against the microbial, but no harm to humans. the unique metabolic pathways identified in margonella may be considered as the new drug targets.

CONCLUSIONS
the pathogenicity-related genes identified in the m. morganii genome encode drug resistance determinants and factors that influence virulence, such as fimbrial adhesins, flagellar structural proteins, components of the iron acquisition system, t3ss, and tcs, an iga protease, haemolysins, ureases, and insecticidal and apoptotic toxins. comparative analysis with  <dig> other enterobacteriaceae genomes revealed several systems that vary between species. these include transposes of the is <dig> family, insecticidal toxins, t3ss components, and proteins required for ethanolamine utilisation and cobalamin biosynthesis. it is interesting to note that neither the eut operon  nor the cob-cbi operon is found in other proteeae genomes. nevertheless, the eut operon is also found in several other non-proteeae enterobacteria genomes, albeit with different gene organisation.

in summary, this is the first report of an m. morganii genome sequence. comparative genome analysis revealed several pathogenicity-related genes and genes not found in other proteeae members. the presence of the eut operon  and the cob-cbi operon in m. morganii but not in the other proteeae genomes studied may explain why m. morganii is more frequently associated with nosocomial bacterial infections. moreover, the evidence that m. morganii shares features with other non-proteeae enterobacteria suggests that horizontal gene transfer has occurred between m. morganii and other intestinal bacteria.
