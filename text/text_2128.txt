BACKGROUND
epistasis is a critical factor in viral evolution  <cit> , in which the phenotypic effect of a given mutation varies under different genetic backgrounds. the importance of epistasis has been demonstrated in drug resistance , immune escape  <cit> , and cross-species adaptation  <cit> . therefore, identification of pairwise epistatic interaction offers valuable information to understand the functional basis of viral evolution in nature.

several virus sequence databases are publicly available , which permit interrogation of evolutionary pathways in nature and allow approximation of the chronological order of mutation accumulation  <cit> . numerous computational algorithms and analytical tools have been developed to identify molecular interactions based on coevolving residues . such phylogenetic information may lead to the identification of epistatic interactions  <cit> . however, coevolving mutations may be attributed to genetic drift and hitchhiking, which can be pervasive in evolution , rather than epistatic interactions. subsequently, many different combinations of mutations have to be individually constructed and analyzed to discern epistatic residues. it becomes inefficient to probe for epistatic interaction based on coevolutionary analysis without any prior knowledge of the mutational fitness effect.

recently, high-throughput genetics becomes a popular strategy to profile the fitness effects of a large number of mutations in parallel  <cit> . the basis of high-throughput genetics is to generate a panel of mutations using high-throughput mutagenesis, and to use deep sequencing to monitor the occurrence frequency of individual mutations when selection is imposed. the change of frequency of each mutation can then be translated into a fitness effect. high-throughput genetics opens up the opportunities to identify critical residues in the protein of interest under any given selection condition. a medically important application is to systematically investigate the effects of mutations in a virus gene or genome . it has been shown that high-throughput genetics facilitates the identification of drug resistance substitutions  <cit> , anti-interferon residues  <cit> , and understanding of the evolution of circulating viral strains  <cit> .

high-throughput genetics is often applied to examine mutational fitness effect under only one genetic background of a virus species in one study. however, due to epistasis, a given mutation may have a very different fitness effect among different genetic backgrounds in nature  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising that some mutations with a low replication fitness in a laboratory strain can be prevalent in nature. indeed, such observation has been made in a high-throughput genetics study of the influenza a virus hemagglutinin protein  <cit> . however, it is not always straightforward to identify the genetic determinant underlying the epistatic effect.

matrix  segment is of the influenza a virus encodes two proteins, namely m <dig> and m <dig>  m <dig> is the matrix protein that forms a protein coat inside the viral envelop. it plays an important role in virus assembly and budding  <cit> . m <dig> is a proton-selective ion channel that facilitates the uncoating of virions in the infected cells  <cit> . in addition, both m <dig> and m <dig> are critical determinants in the morphology of the viral particles  <cit> . while m <dig> is a major target for the development of anti-influenza drug  <cit> , resistance mutations can rapidly emerge without any cost on viral replication fitness  <cit> . on the other hand, being a highly conserved protein, m <dig> is an effective antigen to drive heterosubtypic protection through t-cell immunity  <cit> . in fact, m <dig> has been used as a target for the development of t-cell-based vaccine against influenza virus  <cit> . due to the biomedical significance of the m segment of influenza a virus, it is important to comprehend the fitness consequences of individual mutations and epistatic interactions among mutations in m <dig> and m <dig> 

in this study, we described an approach to identify pairwise epistatic interaction by coupling high-throughput genetics with phylogenetic information. using high-throughput genetics, we were able to systematically identify deleterious substitutions in the m segment of influenza virus a/wsn/ <dig>  three substitutions that were classified as deleterious were prevalence in the circulating strains. a phylogenetic analysis on the circulating strains was then performed to examine whether those substitutions of interest were coevolving with other residues. these analyses led us to identify and experimentally validate the epistatic interaction between a209t and q214h, in which a209t was able to compensate the deleterious effect of q214h. interestingly, both substitutions were prevalent in the  <dig> pandemic swine influenza virus strains, but not in the seasonal influenza virus strains. this study demonstrates the power of combining high-throughput genetics and phylogenetic information to identify epistatic residues.

RESULTS
methodology overview and experimental design
the goal of this study was to develop a methodology to systematically identify pairwise epistatic interaction, more specifically between deleterious mutations and compensatory mutations. we proposed to couple high-throughput genetics with phylogenetic information to achieve such purpose . first, high-throughput genetics could be utilized to identify deleterious mutations. second, sequence database was explored to determine whether any of those deleterious mutations could be observed in naturally occurring sequences. third, if a deleterious mutation could be observed in naturally occurring sequences, a coevolution analysis would be performed to identify potential compensatory mutations. such putative epistatic interaction would then need to be confirmed experimentally. in this study, we provided a proof-of-concept using the m segment of influenza virus.
fig.  <dig> methodology overview and experimental design. a the proposed workflow for identifying pairwise epistatic interaction is shown. key methodologies are boxed. b the experimental scheme is shown. briefly, 293t cells  were transfected with the randomly mutagenized m segment  and the other seven wt segments to generate the viral mutant library. this viral mutant library was used to infect a <dig> cells  for 24-hour to generate the post-infection library. the dna library and the post-infection library were subjected to deep sequencing



high-throughput genetics has been applied to study  <dig> out of  <dig> segments of influenza a virus genome, which include pb <dig> segment  <cit> , pb <dig> segment  <cit> , pa segment  <cit> , ha segment  <cit> , np segment  <cit> , na segment  <cit> , and ns segment  <cit> . in this study, the m segment was analyzed by high-throughput genetics. two different mutant libraries were built, namely the whole segment mutant library and “small libraries”. for the whole segment mutant library, the entire m segment was subjected to mutagenesis. in contrast, for each “small library”, only a 240-bp region was mutagenized. ∼ <dig> % of the nucleotide position of the m segment was covered by the whole segment mutant library, or by four different “small libraries”.

each mutant library was transfected in 293t cells and the resultant viral mutant library was used to infect a <dig> cells for  <dig> hours . both the plasmid mutant library and the post-infection mutant library were subjected to deep sequencing. biological replicates were obtained by independent transfection and infection. we have included two biological replicates for the whole segment mutant library  and three biological replicates for each of the “small libraries” . the sequencing coverage for each sample is shown in table  <dig> 
for those replicates with the library type indicated as “whole segment”, the coverage represents the number of error-corrected reads  <cit> . for those replicates with the library type indicated as “small libraries”, the coverage represents the number of sequencing reads



estimation of fitness effect for individual point mutations
relative fitness index , which was computed as the enrichment ratio of the relative occurrence frequency post−infection to the relative occurrence frequency plasmidmutantlibrary  <cit> , was used as a proxy for the fitness effect of individual point mutations. for each point mutation, five independent rf indices were obtained from five replicates. although the distribution of rf index in different replicates are similar , the spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between rf indices for individual mutations across different replicates is only moderate, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the lack of a strong correlation can be attributed to the bottleneck of genetic diversity in the transfection step as described in other high-throughput genetic studies using the influenza reverse genetic system  <cit> . this bottleneck would result in a limited number of virus mutations being reconstituted from the plasmid mutant library. in other words, even though some mutations were present in the plasmid mutant library, they may not be reconstituted into the viral mutant library due to the bottleneck in the transfection step. those mutations that were not reconstituted into the viral mutant library may not be deleterious, but would be identified as deleterious due to their absence in the post-infection pool. this bottleneck can be viewed as an incomplete sampling process of the plasmid mutant library. our recent study suggested that the bottleneck effect could be relieved by scaling up the transfection by using more dna plasmid and more 293t cells  <cit> .

the spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between rf indices for individual mutations across different replicates are shown



systematic identification of deleterious mutations
the ratio of true positive rate  to false positive rate  was used to evaluate the statistical confidence in the identification of deleterious mutations. in the following, this ratio would be abbreviated as tpr/fpr. tpr was computed as the fraction of nonsense mutations, which were expected to be phenotypically lethal, being identified as deleterious. fpr was computed as the fraction of silent mutations, which were expected to be phenotypically neutral, being identified as deleterious. tpr/fpr could be regarded as a measure of signal-to-noise ratio for the identification of deleterious mutations. a larger value of tpr/fpr represented a higher confidence in the identification of deleterious mutations. we acknowledged that fpr may be slightly overestimated because it is known that some silent mutations may impose a fitness cost.

we tested different cutoffs for rf index for the identification of deleterious mutations . to compile the five rf indices from five replicates  into one single rf index for a given mutation, we proposed three different measures: 1) the highest value among the five rf indices from those five replicates  was used, 2) the average value of the five rf indices from those five replicates  was used, and 3) the median value of the five rf indices from those five replicates . a mutation would be identified as deleterious when its rf index was less than the indicated cutoff. here, all three measures of rf index  were tested against seven different cutoffs, ranging from 2-fold to 8-fold decreased in relative occurrence frequency from plasmid mutant library to post-infection library . the tpr/fpr of both rf index mean and rf index median were lowered than that of rf index max across all tested cutoff. this indicates that rf index max would give the highest confidence among all three measures of rf index in identifying deleterious mutations. for rf index max, tpr/fpr was peaked at  <dig>  with a cutoff of 6-fold decreased in relative occurrence frequency . in other words, there would be a  <dig> -fold enrichment of deleterious mutations over non-deleterious mutations using a 6-fold cutoff for rf index max.

we further tested the impact of including different number of replicates on the confidence in the identification of deleterious mutations. a monotonic increase in tpr/fpr was observed as more replicates were included in the calculation of rf index max, indicating the benefit of having more replicates in the identification of deleterious mutations . in contrast, an increase in the number of replicate did not increase tpr/fpr for both rf index mean and rf index median. again, this result shows the advantage of using rf index max instead of rf index mean or rf index median in the identification of deleterious mutations. subsequently, a 6-fold cutoff for rf index max was employed for the rest of this study, in which  <dig>  % of silent mutations,  <dig> % of nonsense mutations, and  <dig> % of missense mutations were identified as deleterious .

we postulated that due to the presence of the bottleneck effect in the transfection step, the usage of rf index max was more efficient than rf index mean and rf index median in the identification of deleterious mutations. as mentioned above, bottleneck effect in the transfection step would lead to a neutral mutation being identified as a deleterious mutation. however, since the bottleneck was independent in each replicate, the probability for a neutral mutation being identified as neutral in at least one replicate increased as the number of replicates increased. whereas a deleterious mutation should be identified as deleterious regardless of the number of replicates. therefore, the power of using rf index max to distinguish deleterious mutations versus non-deleterious mutations would increase as the number of replicates increased. in contrast, as our results suggest, the power of using rf index mean or rf index median to distinguish deleterious mutations versus non-deleterious mutations would not benefit from an increasing number of replicates. since the goal here was to confidently identify deleterious mutations using the data from five replicates, the usage rf index max, was more suitable than rf index mean or rf index median.

the composition of the rf index max was examined . replicate  <dig> contributed the most to the rf index max, in which  <dig> % of the rf index max came from replicate  <dig>  replicate  <dig> contributed the least to the rf index max, in which  <dig> % of the rf index max came from replicate  <dig>  this variation in contribution to rf index max was likely due to different degrees of bottleneck effect in each replicate.

validation and functional relevance of the high-throughput genetics result
to experimentally confirmed the reliability of our dataset, we randomly selected and individually reconstructed  <dig> substitutions on m <dig> that were identified as deleterious . a virus rescue experiment was performed to assess the fitness effect of these substitutions. seven substitutions  had undetectable viral titer, three substitutions  had two-log drop in viral titer as compared to wild-type , two substitutions  had one-log drop in viral titer as compared to wt, and only one substitution  had wt-like viral titer . overall,  <dig> out of  <dig> substitutions displayed a deficiency in viral replication. note that, deficiency in viral replication was defined by at least 10-fold decrease in viral titer in the rescue experiment, which was a reasonable cutoff as indicated by a large-scale mutational analysis of influenza a virus nucleoprotein  <cit> . this experiment validated our approach in identifying deleterious substitutions.
fig.  <dig> validation of the profiling result by virus rescue experiment. based on the profiling result,  <dig> randomly selected deleterious substitutions  were reconstructed and analyzed by virus rescue experiment. the tcid <dig> measured from the virus rescue experiment is shown. the grey dashed line represents the lower detection limit



we aimed to further confirm the functional relevance of our the high-throughput genetics data by analyzing the essentialness of individual residues. for each amino acid residue, essentialness was computed as the fraction of profiled substitutions being deleterious . in general, residues on m <dig> protein  were more essential, hence less mutable, than residues on m <dig> protein  . projecting the essentialness on the structure of m <dig> revealed the non-mutability of the m1-m <dig> interface , which was important for the oligomerization of m <dig>  <cit>  and was required for matrix layer formation during assembly and budding  <cit> . a quantitative analysis was performed to compare the essentialness of buried residues, residues at the dimeric interface, and other surfaced-exposed residues . the essentialness for residues at the dimeric interface is significantly higher than that of other surface-exposed residues  . in fact, the essentialness of buried residues is also significantly higher than that of other surface-exposed residues  but has no significant difference with that of residues at the dimeric interface . this analysis confirmed the essentialness of the m1-m <dig> interface.
fig.  <dig> functional relevance of the profiling result. a at each amino acid residue, essentialness represents the fraction of profiled substitutions being deleterious. the essentialness for those residue with ≥  <dig> substitutions being profiled is shown. each data point is colored according to the value of essentialness: essentialness =  <dig> ,  <dig> < essentialness ≤  <dig>  ,  <dig>  < essentialness ≤  <dig>  ,  <dig>  < essentialness ≤  <dig>  ,  <dig>  < essentialness ≤  <dig> . b the distributions of essentialness for individual residues on m <dig> and m <dig> are shown as boxplots. c the essentialness is projected on the structure of homodimer of m <dig> n-terminal domain   <cit> . residues are color-coded as that of panel a. those residues with <  <dig> substitutions being profiled is colored in grey. d individual residues on m <dig> n-terminal domain were categorized into buried residues, surface-exposed residues at the homodimer interface, and other surface-exposed residues. the distributions of essentialness for these three categories are shown as boxplots. e the essentialness is projected on the structure of homotetramer of m <dig> ion channel   <cit> . residues are color coded according to that of panel a. those residues with <  <dig> substitutions being profiled is colored in grey



for m <dig>  only two highly essential residues, h <dig> and w <dig>  were observed on the structure . these two residues are absolutely required for the ion channel function  <cit> , in which h <dig> acts as a selectivity filter  <cit>  and w <dig> acts as a channel gate  <cit> . overall, these analyses demonstrate the functional relevance of our high-throughput genetics result.

discrepancy between natural sequence variation and fitness profiling data
we were mostly interested in identifying and studying those deleterious substitutions that were prevalent in nature, if any. we then compared the rf index max and the natural occurrence frequency for individual substitutions. this comparison was done separately for h1n <dig> seasonal influenza viruses  and  <dig> h1n <dig> pandemic swine influenza viruses  using the sequence information retrieved from influenza research database  <cit> . interestingly, we identified three substitutions that appeared as deleterious in our high-throughput genetics data , yet were prevalence in naturally occurring influenza sequences  . these three substitutions were c50s on m <dig> , d231n on m <dig> , and q214h on m <dig> . these three substitutions were individually reconstructed. the deleterious effects of m <dig> q214h and m <dig> d231n were validated by virus rescue experiment . in fact, the deleterious effect of m <dig> d231n was also previously demonstrated in another genetic background  <cit> . however, m <dig> c50s, which was shown to be a non-essential palmitoylation site  <cit> , had no fitness cost in the virus rescue experiment . we postulated that either c50s was a false positive from the identification of deleterious mutations or with a fitness cost that could only be detectable under a competitive growth environment which resembled that of the high-throughput genetics experiment. consequently, m <dig> c50s was ignored in the downstream analysis.
fig.  <dig> comparison between natural variation and profiling result. the relationship between rf index max for individual amino acid substitutions and the occurrence frequency in natural circulating strains is shown. this comparison was performed on both m <dig> and m <dig> proteins with seasonal influenza virus strains  and  <dig> pandemic swine influenza virus strains  being analyzed independently. the grey dashed line represents the cutoff for classifying mutations as deleterious

identification of potential compensatory substitutions by coevolution analysis
next, we aimed to investigate the genetic mechanism of the prevalence of those deleterious substitutions in nature. one possibility was that the fitness effects of those substitutions were genetic background-dependent. in other words, substitutions which appeared as deleterious in strain a/wsn/ <dig>  the strain employed in this study, may have no fitness cost in other virus strains. we hypothesized that compensatory substitutions for those deleterious substitutions may exist in certain naturally occurring strains. those compensatory substitutions, if they exist, could potentially be identified using phylogenetic information.

subsequently, a coevolution analysis using caps  <cit>  was performed to search for intra-protein coevolving residues . caps was featured by its ability to eliminate background correlations and minimize stochastic dependencies between sites using phylogenetic information. thus, it possessed a lower false positive rate and a higher sensitivity as compared to other algorithms for detecting coevolving residues  <cit> . here, caps was able to identified four residues  on m <dig> that were coevolving with residue  <dig>  in addition, caps detected that residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were coevolved as a group. residues  <dig> and  <dig> were located on the structurally unresolved m <dig> c-terminal domain  along with residue  <dig>  while residue  <dig> was located on m <dig> n-terminal domain . nonetheless, no residue was found to coevolve with residue  <dig> on m <dig>  as a result, our analysis below focused on residue  <dig> and the two coevolving residues  <dig> and  <dig> that were located in the same protein domain. a significant difference in amino acid usage at these sites was detected between seasonal flu and swine flu. for seasonal flu, glutamine  dominated at residue  <dig> , serine  dominated at residue  <dig> , and alanine  dominated at residue  <dig> . for swine flu, histidine  dominated at residue  <dig> , threonine  dominated at residue  <dig> , and asparagine  dominated at residue  <dig> . therefore, we hypothesized that the replication defect of q214h could be compensated by either s207n or a209t, or both of them.

we also examined the natural variant at residue  <dig>  which was also located in the c-terminal domain and shown to be coevolving with residue  <dig> . nonetheless, glutamine  was dominated at residue  <dig>  regardless of whether the amino acid at residue  <dig> was glutamine  or histidine . it suggests that, at least in natural evolution, mutation at residue  <dig> was unlikely to impose a significant compensatory effect on the fitness cost q214h.

a209t is a compensatory substitution for q214h
to test our hypothesis, the fitness effects of s207n and a209t on q214h were tested by virus rescue experiment. while the addition of s207n further decreased the viral titer, addition of a209t fully restored the viral titer to wt level . a multicycle replication assay was also performed. the viral titer of q214h was ∼100-fold lower than wt across different time points . this defect was rescued with the addition of a209t. however, a209t alone did not improve the replication kinetics above the wild type. together, these results showed that a209t could act as a compensatory substitution for q214h. in fact, a209t and q214h were both located at a putative α-helix, helix  <dig> , of the m <dig> c-terminal domain  <cit> . it has been shown that residue  <dig> was one of the determinants of influenza virion morphology and spreading kinetics  <cit> , whereas residue  <dig> was involved in adaptation to mice  <cit> . in addition, most single-amino acid substitutions at their neighboring residues, namely  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were shown to attenuate the viral growth  <cit> . together with our results, these evidences support the functional importance of residues  <dig> to  <dig> in viral replication. we further speculate that additional epistatic interactions may be present in this region.

the interaction between a209t and q214h in m <dig> demonstrates the feasibility of identifying epistatic residues through an integration of high-throughput genetics and phylogenetic information. this analytic strategy is generally applicable to any viral gene of interest, provided that the information on natural sequence variants is available.

discussion
high-throughput genetics has been applied to many different genes to quantify the fitness effects of a large number of single-mutations in parallel  <cit> . however, high-throughput genetics alone is not sufficient to identify epistatic interactions between sites. although our recent study has successfully profile all pairwise epistatic interactions in a 56-residue protein domain  <cit> , the mutant library complexity, hence the cost, of such approach increases polynomially with the length of the protein. consequently, the feasibility of profiling epistasis using high-throughput genetics alone is limited to small protein domains. by combining high throughput genetics with a phylogenetically-corrected analysis of co-evolving sites in naturally occurring sequence datasets, our approach permits the identification of epistatic residues.

here, high-throughput genetics is performed on influenza virus a/wsn/ <dig>  which is a relatively old strain. however, most part of the high-throughput genetics data obtained in this study should be applicable to more recent strains. previous studies have shown that high-throughput genetics data obtained from strain a/wsn/ <dig> allowed an accurate modeling of natural evolution of influenza a virus across several decades  <cit> . furthermore, a recent study showed that two sets of high-throughput genetics data obtained from two strains separated by more than three decades were highly correlated  <cit> . therefore, we postulate that most deleterious mutations identified in this study should carry a fitness cost when they are introduced to more recent strains. nonetheless, we also acknowledge that additional epistatic interactions may be identified if our high-throughput genetics analysis is performed on more than one strain.

while this study focuses on a single gene, our approach can potentially be applied to study intergenic epistatic interaction. the biomedical relevance of intergenic epistasis can be highlighted by human immunodeficiency virus  resistance to protease inhibitor, in which substitutions on gag can compensate the deleterious effect associated with the drug resistance substitutions on protease  <cit> . in fact, coevolution analysis is a major bioinformatics approach to predict protein-protein interaction  <cit> . we propose that by coupling with coevolution analysis of an appropriate sequence dataset, high-throughput genetics can be applied to any given interacting protein pair to search for interacting residues. nevertheless, we do acknowledged that correlated evolution between proteins can be dominated by similar constraints on evolutionary rate but not coevolution per se  <cit> . therefore, adapting our method to search for intergenic epistasis may be more challenging than to identify intragenic epistasis as described in this study.

compensatory mutation is a type of sign epistasis  <cit> . in the presence of sign epistasis, the fitness effect of a given mutation could exhibit different sign  depending on the genetic background. on the other hand, for magnitude epistasis, the fitness effect of a given mutation would not change sign, but would display a different magnitude depending on genetic background. although our approach is able to identify sign epistasis, it may be difficult to adapt our approach to search for magnitude epistasis, which has a more subtle impact in fitness effect. consequently, identification of magnitude epistasis would require a more accurate quantification of mutational fitness effects and a more sophisticated analysis to infer mutational fitness effect using phylogenetic information.

recently, there is an increasing interest in higher-order epistasis, which describes the epistatic interaction between more than two mutations  <cit> . while this study focuses on pairwise epistasis, we propose that our approach can be adapted to search for higher-order epistasis. for example, higher-order epistasis can potentially be identified by deleterious mutations that emerged as a group in natural evolution, where each mutation within the group alone is deleterious but the entire group of mutations together has a neutral or beneficial fitness effect. therefore, combining phylogenetic information and high-throughput genetics can potentially facilitate the understanding of higher-order epistasis in natural evolution.

during the course of our work, melamed et al. published a study that integrated high-throughput genetics with multiple sequence alignment of evolutionarily divergent variants to identify protein-binding sites on saccharomyces cerevisiae poly-binding protein, pab <dig>  <cit> . more specifically, they have demonstrated that deleterious substitutions that naturally existed could be due to the evolutionary divergence of functional interface. while their aim and approach are different from our work here, both melamed et al. and this study suggest that high-throughput genetics and natural sequence variation can be synergistic for mapping protein sequence-function relationship.

our recent study has indicated that functional residues can be efficiently identified by combining protein structure information and high-throughput genetics  <cit> . in this study, protein structure information was not extensively utilized due to the absence of structural information in the region of interest . nevertheless, it is shown that combining coevolution analysis with structural information improves the identification of residue interactions  <cit> , and helps classify the type of coevolution   <cit> . therefore, protein structure information can be highly valuable for mapping epistatic interaction. future approach for studying second or higher-order interactions may integrate phylogenetic information, protein structure information and high-throughput genetics.

CONCLUSIONS
this work demonstrates a hybrid strategy to identify epistatic residues by combining phylogenetic information and high-throughput genetics. we successfully identified the epistatic interaction between influenza a virus m <dig> substitutions a209t and q214h. while our proof-of-concept is based on a viral protein, our approach can potentially be applied to probe for epistatic residues in any protein of interest, provided that the phylogenetic information is available.
