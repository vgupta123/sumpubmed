BACKGROUND
retroviruses are rna viruses that, when infecting a host cell, produce a viral reverse transcriptase and a viral integrase that make a dna copy of the viral genome and integrate it into the host genome, respectively  <cit> . the family retroviridae comprises a diverse range of animal viruses, including the viral genus lentivirus. lentiviruses have been isolated from primates, domestic and wild felids, and a variety of domestic ungulates   <cit> . until recently, all known lentiviruses were classified as exogenous   <cit> . however, in  <dig>  katzourakis and colleagues  <cit>  reported the first endogenous lentivirus identified in any species, the rabbit endogenous lentivirus type k , present in the genome of the european rabbit . relik has subsequently been reported in other leporid genera , establishing it as at least  <dig> million years  old  <cit> . these striking observations demonstrate that lentiviruses are more widespread than previously thought, extending the host range to a different mammalian order, and demonstrate that lentiviruses can be endogenized  <cit> .

the intense study of lentiviruses in the past  <dig> years, especially of human immunodeficiency viruses , has been more recently accompanied by the study of antiretroviral restriction factors, like the trim5α protein, one of the members of trim family  <cit> . trim proteins contain three domains, which together constitute the canonical tripartite motif, including an n-terminal ring domain, one or two b-box domains and a long coiled-coil  domain  <cit> . trim <dig>  like most trim proteins, also contains a c-terminal pryspry domain, composed of four "variable loops"  <cit> . trim5α is the largest isoform encoded by the trim <dig> gene and restricts infection by hiv- <dig> and other retroviruses, dependent on a species-specific sequence variation in the pryspry domain, upon entry into the host cell cytoplasm and prior to reverse transcription  <cit> . each trim5α domain plays distinct roles in its antiviral restriction activity. the ring domain has been shown to confer e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity crucial for anti-hiv restriction  <cit> . the b-box  <dig> domain influences recognition of the viral capsid by the c-terminal pryspry domain  <cit> . the cc domain plays an important role in the restriction of viral infectivity and it is required for trimerization  <cit> . particularly for hiv- <dig> and n-tropic murine leukemia virus  retroviruses, restriction specificity has been mapped to the pryspry domain for hiv- <dig> and n-mlv restriction specificity is determined by both the cc and pryspry domains  <cit> . human trim5α is not effective against hiv- <dig> but does inhibit n-mlv, while rhesus monkey trim5α restricts both  <cit> . however, a single amino acid change  in the human trim5α pryspry domain causes it to behave like rhesus trim5α with regard to hiv- <dig> restriction  <cit> . the pryspry domain binds to the viral capsid, and the domain sequence variation determines the restriction specificity  <cit> . recently, evidence from several studies began elucidating the detailed mechanism of trim5α activity. also, additional activities linked to viral restriction have been described, including a role in signal transduction, the promotion of innate immune signaling and recognition of the retroviral capsid lattice  <cit> . it has been suggested that direct binding of trim5α to the viral capsid leads to disruption of specific inter-hexamer interfaces, causing structural damage to the capsid. trim5α spontaneously forms a hexagonal lattice complementary to the capsid lattice, a molecular signature of retroviruses, which greatly stimulates trim5α lattice formation  <cit> .

evolutionary studies of primate trim5α revealed a high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes in the pryspry domain  <cit> . the distribution of positively selected residues is not random, but falls in a very tight cluster at the beginning of the domain in a  <dig> amino acid "patch", essential for retroviral restriction and responsible, in part, for the species-specific restriction activity  <cit> . the same domain has also undergone length variation and segmental duplications in different primate lineages  <cit> . however, polymorphisms found in the trim5α coding sequence for multiple individuals from two divergent lineages of old world monkeys , indicated that specificity varies not only between different species but also within species  <cit> . despite the geographic separation and the divergence time , both species presented a highly similar pattern of polymorphisms, which constitutes compelling evidence for long-term balancing selection at the trim <dig> locus  <cit> . similar evidence of selection has been recently reported for the first intron of human trim <dig> gene, which may affect transcription factor-binding sites and trim <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> .

although evolutionary and functional studies of trim5α antiretroviral restriction activity have primarily focused on the primate lineage, trim <dig> orthologs have been reported in other mammalian genomes, e.g. mouse, rat, cow and european rabbit  <cit> . active trim <dig> was identified in the european rabbit and the ability to restrict the replication of multiple unrelated retroviruses was also described  <cit> . besides this leporid, fletcher and co-workers  <cit>  reported the restriction of divergent retroviruses by european brown hare  trim5α and also significant differences between both leporids' trim5α pryspry domains. these authors suggested that retroviruses like relik may have driven the speciation of the old world rabbit and hare trim5α orthologs. the order lagomorpha is divided into two families, ochotonidae and leporidae, which diverged around  <dig> my ago  <cit> . ochotonidae contains only one extant genus, ochotona, while the family leporidae includes  <dig> genera where, lepus, sylvilagus and oryctolagus, the most well-studied leporid genera, diverged around  <dig> my ago  <cit> . it has been suggested that the global development of temperate grasslands  and the formation of the west antarctic ice sheet  promoted the development of land bridges and consequent dispersal of the genus lepus from north america through asia and into africa  <cit> . the new world sylvilagus lineage initially remained in north america from which it more recently colonized south america  <cit> . the genus oryctolagus is the only leporid genus native to europe and consists of two subspecies, o. cuniculus cuniculus and o. cuniculus algirus, which diverged around  <dig> my ago. the subspecies o. c. algirus is restricted to the southwest region of the iberian peninsula and a few atlantic islands, whereas o. c. cuniculus has essentially a man-made worldwide distribution and includes all domestic breeds  <cit> .

as previously suggested, considering that relik must already have been present in a common ancestor of these leporid genera, the hypothesis that lentiviruses might have been the driving force of the leporid trim5α conserved antiretroviral activity can be challenged by extending the study of evolutionary patterns of trim5α to other members of the leporidae family, particularly to the new world sylvilagus lineage. therefore, in this study we have examined the trim5α gene of additional subspecies and species of the three leporid genera: european rabbit subspecies , the old world iberian hare  and european brown hare, and the new world brush rabbit .

RESULTS
trim5α divergence and phylogeny in lagomorpha
in this study, all the deduced trim5α protein sequences obtained from leporids were aligned and compared to that previously described for the european rabbit   <cit>  . to more completely assess the trim5α gene in the lagomorpha order, we also included american pika  trim5α nucleotide sequence retrieved from the whole genome shotgun  project . during this work, we were able to bridge the american pika protein sequence gaps previously reported  <cit>  .

the  <dig> my divergence between european rabbit subspecies apparently allowed the accumulation of one private residue in the o. c. algirus pryspry v <dig> region , different from o. c. cuniculus . amino acid position  <dig> was described as being polymorphic in o. c. cuniculus  <cit> , but o. c. algirus clones presented the same residue . in addition, two other polymorphisms were observed in o. c. algirus clones, one in the bb <dig> domain  and the other in the cc domain  .

the sequencing of european brown hare trim5α confirmed the previously reported findings  <cit> . however, our lagomorpha trim5α alignment was somewhat different from that of fletcher and colleagues  <cit>  due to the inclusion of new species and a more complete american pika protein sequence. out of the  <dig> pryspry v <dig> region residues, we identified  <dig> differing positions between the european brown hare and the european rabbit, resulting in 50% identity among v <dig> regions . trim5α from another species of hare, iberian hare, was also sequenced in this study. with fourteen clones from two individuals, we identified two alleles differing at three positions, each of them located within the pryspry variable region   . as expected, the overall identity between the trim5α protein sequence of european rabbit and the trim5α deduced protein sequence of the iberian hare  was the same as that previously reported for the european brown hare   <cit>  which contrasted with the high divergence at the pryspry v <dig> region  . the six amino acid positions previously identified as being polymorphic residues in the european brown hare  <cit>  apparently were not polymorphic in the iberian hare trim5α sequenced clones. in fact, all the iberian hare clones presented the same residues as the european brown hare allele  <dig> in these six positions . however, four positions of all the iberian hare trim5α sequenced clones  differed from both european brown hare alleles . none of them occurred in the pryspry v <dig> region, which was identical among lepus species, except for two polymorphic positions, one in the european brown hare allele  <dig>  and one in the iberian hare allele  <dig> .

the proposed leporid phylogeny estimates that the lepus lineage diverged  <dig>  my ago from the oryctolagus/sylvilagus clade, and that the sylvilagus and oryctolagus genera diverged  <dig> my ago  <cit> . to extend the study of leporid trim5α, we determined the trim5α nucleotide sequence from brush rabbit . as the sylvilagus and oryctolagus genera are closely related, a higher identity between their trim5α proteins was expected and, indeed, the brush rabbit trim5α deduced protein sequence was 91% identical to the european rabbit protein . however, such increase in similarity was not observed at the pryspry v <dig> region . from the seven clones obtained for this species, no polymorphisms were observed.

the high divergence obtained in the pryspry v <dig> region could be explained by gene conversion with adjacent genes. gene conversion has been reported in other mammalian genes. for example, in leporids, a gene conversion event was observed between the two chromosomally adjacent genes ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  where the sequence motif 194qtlkmt <dig> of the ccr <dig> protein was replaced by the htimrn motif which is characteristic of ccr <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, none of the chromosomally adjacent genes showed clear evidence of gene conversion with trim <dig>  making this explanation unlikely. furthermore, no significant blast matches were obtained during searches of the mammalian ncbi database. no evidence of recombination between alleles was observed.

to obtain evidence of within-species variation, the number of individuals per species should be significant. in this study, the number of individuals was low, limiting the accuracy of the observed polymorphisms. however, it cannot be ruled out that some of the sites that appeared to be variable between species are polymorphisms present within species, especially when considering the two closely related lepus species. a case of trans-species polymorphism was reported in a study of the evolution of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region in oryctolagus and lepus  <cit> . in light of the previously described long-term balancing selection on primate trim5α  <cit> , this scenario cannot be excluded in leporids.

lagomorpha trim5α phylogenetic trees, based on nucleotide, including all described alleles, and amino acid deduced sequences, were obtained with the maximum likelihood method . trim5α nucleotide and amino acid sequences of three primates , chimpanzee  and rhesus monkey ), and trim <dig> nucleotide and amino acid sequences of european rabbit and human were also included. the trees typology was coincident with the known species tree  <cit> , where trim <dig> sequences represented an outgroup, and primate and lagomorph trim5α formed two orthologs groups. due to the identical typology between the two sets of data, only the tree based on nucleotide sequences is represented in figure  <dig> 

inference of positive selection in lagomorpha trim5α protein
to identify a specific pattern of nucleotide substitution in the leporid trim5α protein, synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates were estimated using the nei-gojobori method  <cit>  and a non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratio  was calculated . under neutrality, coding sequences are expected to present a ratio of non-synonymous substitutions  over synonymous substitutions  that does not significantly deviate from  <dig> , while significant deviations may be interpreted as either the result of positive selection  or of negative selection . this simple analysis showed that the ratios obtained between genera ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , clearly higher than  <dig>  suggesting that trim5α is under strong positive selection.

the high variability of the pryspry domain and the positive selection of trim5α described in primates  <cit>  prompted fletcher and colleagues   <cit>  to perform a codon-based selection analysis using the random effect likelihood  model. with this analysis, the authors identified  <dig> positively-selected codons,  <dig> of which were located in the pryspry v <dig> region  <cit> . using the same methodology and parameters, we identified  <dig> positively-selected codons,  <dig> of which are located in the pryspry domain and, more specifically,  <dig> in the v <dig> region . in figure  <dig> the amino acid and nucleotide sequences of lagomorpha pryspry v <dig> region are represented and the non-synonymous substitutions are marked. it should be pointed out that the pryspry domain was the site of the most intense positive selection in primates  <cit> ; its v <dig> region was identified as the major determinant of anti-hiv- <dig> potency distinguishing the human and rhesus monkey trim5α proteins  <cit> . the proposed evolutionary model for primate trim5α in which a history of virus-host interactions led to species-specific adaptations  <cit>  can be considered also for leporids. but again, the trans-species scenario between leporid species cannot be ruled out to explain the species-specific variations.

our striking observation was visually reinforced by sliding-window analysis of trim5α nucleotide divergence between species . comparing oryctolagus with other leporid genera that diverged about  <dig> my ago, the nucleotide differences throughout the gene occurred primarily around  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  nucleotide replacements per site for lepus and sylvilagus species, respectively . nevertheless, the nucleotide differences peak  was observed around nucleotide position  <dig>  where the pryspry v <dig> region is located . the  <dig> my separation between ochotona and the leporids is apparent in the  <dig>  to  <dig>  nucleotide replacements per site when comparing american pika to european rabbit . however, the peak in the v <dig> region is still clearly defined. these observations can be compared to the nucleotide differences among primates. the approximately  <dig> - <dig> my of evolutionary divergence between human and chimpanzee  <cit>  resulted in a nucleotide difference of 0- <dig>  nucleotide replacements per site, although some peaks are still defined, including one around the nucleotide position  <dig> . comparison of the human and rhesus monkey also revealed a peak in the pryspry v <dig> region , variance similar to that observed among leporid genera , although the average nucleotide differences are higher than between leporids , which is consistent with the <  <dig> my divergence time between human and rhesus monkey  <cit> .

the interest in studying ancient extinct viruses  in primate genomes has increased in the past few years. however, using sequences of "modern" viruses to identify paleoviruses has been a problem and some new strategies began to be applied. the approach broadly used consists in looking for signatures of evolutionary adaptation in antiviral genes  <cit> . several primate antiviral genes have already been studied and positive selection was inferred, including the focus of this paper, trim5α . the detection of extensive diversity in primate trim5α led the scientific community to speculate that endogenous retroviruses and/or exogenous lentiviral pathogens may have exerted selective pressure on this host restriction factor and, in the specific case of human trim5α, that the acquisition of resistance to specific ancient endogenous retroviruses may be responsible for our susceptibility to hiv- <dig> in the present-day  <cit> .

assuming that selective pressure acts on the trim5α region that recognizes variation in the capsid of retroviruses, it was predicted that the pryspry v <dig> region represents the interface with the capsid  <cit> . recent studies showed that relik is highly similar structurally to modern-day exogenous lentiviruses and that the capacity of the capsid to form a protein-protein complex with cypa is maintained  <cit> . cypa is a host cell peptidyl proline isomerase that binds to the retroviral capsid  <cit> . with the absence of known exogenous lentiviruses affecting leporids, endogenous retroviruses such as relik were suggested to dominate leporid trim5α evolution after host germline infection  <cit> . our prediction was that the trim5α protein from the third leporid genus known to harbor relik, the new world genus sylvilagus, should also reflect selective pressure patterns in specific regions previously reported for the old world oryctolagus and lepus genera. in fact, despite sylvilagus being more closely related to oryctolagus, the sequence divergence in trim5α is comparable to that found between european brown hare, iberian hare and the two o. cuniculus subspecies, particularly in the pryspry v <dig> region where the majority of positively-selected codons is concentrated.

the current release of both european rabbit and american pika genomes has increased the opportunities to identify other lagomorpha endogenous retroviruses, remnants of ancient extinct viruses. at the same time, while comparing sequence data from several orthologs of lagomorph antiviral genes, signatures of evolutionary change in these antiviral genes could date when different ancient viral pathogens acted. of course, it is not correct to fully assume that only one ancient retrovirus was responsible for selectively pressuring a specific antiviral gene and vice versa, or that an exogenous lentiviruses did not play a preponderant role in trim5α lagomorpha evolution. however, until other endogenous retroviruses are identified in leporid or even lagomorph genomes and due to the absence of known exogenous lentiviruses infecting leporids, we speculate that endogenous retroviruses like relik could have acted as evolutionary forces on leporid trim5α.

CONCLUSIONS
this evolutionary study on lagomorpha trim5α gene shows a remarkable differentiation in the pryspry v <dig> region suggesting that this gene has evolved under a high selective pressure within the lagomorpha order. with the exception of studies on the primate lineage, this is one of the first comprehensive and detailed evolutionary studies of the antiretroviral restriction factor trim5α. furthermore, the similarities observed in the species split within primates and lagomorphs allow the establishment of comparisons of the evolutionary patterns observed in trim5α gene.
