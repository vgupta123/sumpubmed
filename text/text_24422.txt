BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis , the causative agent of tuberculosis, carries different virulence factors, which allow proliferation of the pathogen in the host cell, cell-to-cell spread, and evasion of immune response. among the most known virulence factors, phospholipases c  stand out in several intracellular bacteria, including clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogen <cit> . the most virulent plc characterised to date is the α toxin  from clostridium perfringens exhibiting lethal, haemolytic, dermonecrotic, vascular permeabilising, and platelet-aggregating properties  <cit> . thus, due to their role in the virulence mechanisms of many bacterial pathogens, the relevance of plcs during mycobacterial infection has been the subject of investigation  <cit> .

mycobacterium tuberculosis plcs are encoded by four different genes  <cit> . three of these genes, plc-a, plc-b, and plc-c, are closely located, constituting an operon, whereas plc-d is located in a different region  <cit> . moreover, polymorphisms frequently affect plc genes in mtb, as observed in different clinical isolates  <cit> .

the importance of plc in mycobacterium virulence was brought out by the demonstration that triple Δplcabc and quadruple Δplcabcd mtb mutants attenuated tuberculosis infection in mice  <cit> . in addition, it has been previously shown that all mtb plcs present cytotoxic effects on macrophages in vitro. recombinant plc proteins expressed in m. smegmatis induced necrosis by hydrolysing membrane constitutive phospholipids into diacylglycerol   <cit> . c. perfringens-plc also induces cell necrosis through releases of dag from host membrane by a mechanism dependent on activation of pkc, mek/erk, and nfkb pathways, leading to high concentrations of reactive oxygen species  and oxidative stress  <cit> .

an increasing number of studies have highlighted the relationship between lipid mediators and cell death. also, subversion of host eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways has been used as an evasion mechanism by a virulent mycobacterium  <cit> . it has been recently shown that infection with the attenuated mtb strain h37ra resulted in abundant production of the cox- <dig> product prostaglandin e <dig> , and consequently in activation of membrane repair mechanism. on the other hand, the virulent strain h37rv induces the production of lipoxin a <dig> , which is an inhibitor of cox- <dig> expression and favours necrosis in infected cells  <cit> . thus, the lipid mediators pge <dig> and lxa <dig> appear to exert opposing effects on mtb-induced cell death in macrophages. another central lipid mediator in mtb infection is leukotriene b <dig> . we have previously shown that inhibition of leukotriene synthesis increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infection and pointed out alveolar macrophages as the main target for immunostimulatory actions of ltb <dig> <cit> .

given that mycobacterial plcs have been associated with cell death, in this study we investigated whether this effect is related to the modulation of lipid mediator production induced by plcs. using two mtb clinical isolates bearing genetic variations that affect plc genes, we investigated how plcs affect the outcome of mtb-driven alveolar macrophage death and its relationship with lipid mediator production.

RESULTS
plcs-expressing mycobacterium tuberculosis is more resistant to microbicidal activity and is associated with alveolar macrophage death
the virulence phenotypes of the isolates 97- <dig> and 97- <dig> were compared regarding the resistance or susceptibility to alveolar macrophage microbicidal activity. as shown in figure 1a, after  <dig> hours of infection, the isolate 97- <dig>  was more resistant to killing by alveolar macrophage than 97- <dig> . considering that mycobacterial plcs have cytotoxic effects on macrophages  <cit> , we studied the viability of rat alveolar macrophages infected in vitro with the isolates 97- <dig> or 97- <dig> to investigate if cell death is associated to mycobacterial plcs. in comparison to uninfected cells, mycobacterium isolate 97- <dig> reduced cell viability by more than 40%, which was approximately 20% higher than the cell death induced by 97- <dig> . regarding the cell death modality, alveolar macrophages infected with 97- <dig> underwent significantly more death by necrosis, and no differences were observed in apoptosis induced by 97- <dig> or 97- <dig> isolates . these results suggest that mtb bearing plcs genes plays a role in host-cell death by inducing necrosis, which contributes significantly to mycobacterial resistance to microbicidal activity of alveolar macrophages.

plcs-expressing mycobacterium tuberculosis more efficiently stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines and no by alveolar macrophages in vitro
the results shown in figure  <dig> indicate that the isolate 97- <dig> is more resistant to bactericidal activity by inducing host-cell necrosis. thus, we next asked if the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and no is affected, since these mediators are essential for host control of mtb infection  <cit> . in addition, previous data from our lab revealed that lungs from mice infected with the isolate 97- <dig> presented extended tissue damage, which was suggested to be associated with strong production of pro-inflammatory cytokines . here, in vitro infection showed that both isolates induced a strong production of no and the cytokines tnf-α, il- <dig>  il-1α, il-1β, and il- <dig>  however, the amount of inflammatory cytokines and no released in response to the 97- <dig> isolate was significantly higher than that induced by the 97- <dig> isolate . despite the increased production of il- <dig>  no difference was observed between macrophages infected with the two different isolates .

we also evaluated the ability of plcs to activate cell-signalling. kinase proteins are directly associated to cytokine production in pro-inflammatory cell responses to bacterial stimulus  <cit> , including mtb  <cit> . also, considering that other bacterial plcs were previously reported to trigger host-cell signalling pathways  <cit> , we sought to verify if the mycobacterial isolates from this study differentially activate cell-signalling proteins. alveolar macrophages infected with both mtb isolates showed increased phosphorylation of three serine-threonine protein kinases: mapk p <dig>  erk1/ <dig>  and the c-jun n-terminal kinase jnk1/ <dig>  notably, the isolate 97- <dig> induced higher levels of kinase phosphorylation than 97- <dig> after  <dig> minutes of bacteria–host cell contact. on the other hand, host plc-γ was not activated by either isolate . these data suggest that plc, as a mycobacterial virulence factor, plays a role in the cell activation and induction of proinflammatory cytokines by alveolar macrophages.

plcs-expressing mycobacterium tuberculosis impaired cox- <dig> and pge2/ltb <dig> receptor mrna expression
virulent mtb uses the control of host-cell death pathways as a strategy to avoid immune response through subversion of host eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways  <cit> . thus, to investigate if the plcs represent a virulence advantage to the bacillus, we next evaluated the expression of mrna for enzymes and receptors involved in the eicosanoid synthesis, such as 5-lipoxygenase , 5-lo activating protein , leukotriene b <dig>  receptor , cyclooxygenase- <dig> , and the pge <dig> receptors ep- <dig> and ep- <dig>  no differences were observed in 5-lo or flap mrna expression induced by the mtb isolates. on other hand, the isolate 97- <dig> induced higher expression of blt <dig> gene , which is known to bind ltb <dig> and thus is related to antimicrobial defence   <cit> . differential expression was also observed for genes related to the pge <dig> synthesis pathway. during the first hours of mtb infection , the expression of the inducible gene ptgs <dig>  which encodes cox- <dig>  was higher in response to the 97- <dig> isolate. after  <dig> hours, although the increased ptgs <dig> expression was maintained, it was lower than that induced by mtb 97- <dig>  associated with cox- <dig> induction, gene expression of the prostaglandin receptors ep- <dig> and ep- <dig> was also higher in alveolar macrophages infected with 97- <dig>   <dig> hours after infection . these findings suggest that plcs-expressing mycobacterium tuberculosis subverts the eicosanoid synthesis pathway by inhibiting cox- <dig>  ep- <dig>  and ep- <dig> expression, thereby directly influencing the generation of pge <dig> and its related cellular response.

eicosanoid production is differentially induced by plc-expressing mycobacterium tuberculosis during alveolar macrophages infection
to study whether the modulation of cox- <dig> and eicosanoid receptor expression by the 97- <dig> mtb has effects on the biosynthesis of these mediators, we quantified pge <dig> and ltb <dig> production by mtb-infected alveolar macrophages at different time points. figure 4a shows that  <dig> h after infection, pge <dig> production induced by 97- <dig> mtb was similar to that induced by 97- <dig> mtb. however, after  <dig> h, 97- <dig> mtb-induced pge <dig> production decreased drastically and remained lower at  <dig> h post-infection. differently,  <dig> and  <dig> h after infection, ltb <dig> production induced by the isolate 97- <dig> was higher than that induced by 97- <dig> . together, our results support the idea that plcs-expressing mtb are involved in decreased pge <dig> production and lower ep-2/ <dig> gene expression, impairing eicosanoid-signalling pathway in alveolar macrophages.

cell death and subversion of pge <dig> production are dependent on mycobacterial plcs
thus far, our results showed that the mtb isolate 97- <dig> induces necrotic death in alveolar macrophages, which is associated with lower expression of cox- <dig> and pge <dig> receptors, leading to reduced production of pge <dig>  compared with infection by 97- <dig>  we next examined whether these effects are plc-dependent. to do that, we used the widely described plc inhibitors d <dig> and u <dig>  <cit> . thus, we pre-incubated both mtb isolates with plc inhibitors  separately or combined , and analysed the ability of the bacilli to cause necrosis and the effect on pge <dig> production. the treatment of mtb isolates with plc inhibitors severely reduced necrosis of 97-1505-infected cells, whereas it did not affect the necrosis of plc-deficient 97-1200-infected cells. moreover, treatment with plc inhibitors had no effect on apoptosis induced by both isolates . likewise, pge <dig> production by mtb 97-1505-infected alveolar macrophages presented levels similar to those produced by 97-1200-infected cells, and plc inhibition did not affect the pge <dig> production in cells infected by 97- <dig> . finally, to address the role of pge <dig> in cell death, celecoxib, a cox- <dig> inhibitor, was added to the culture, which increased necrosis rate in cells infected with both isolates. on the other hand, addition of pge <dig> prevented cell necrosis during infection with the isolate 97- <dig> . taken together, these data reinforce that infection with mtb harbouring plcs induces host-cell necrosis, which may be related to the subversion of pge <dig> synthesis.

discussion
the central finding of this study was that plc-expressing mycobacterium tuberculosis is more virulent than mtb lacking these enzymes, through inducing necrosis of alveolar macrophages, which is associated to subversion of pge <dig> production. this is the first study to demonstrate such a role for mycobacterial plcs using clinical isolates, which actually cause tuberculosis, instead of models of recombinant expression of these enzymes in non-pathogenic mycobacteria.

we showed that plc-expressing mtb  induced high rates of alveolar macrophage death, especially through necrosis, whereas the plc-deficient mtb , despite its ability to cause cell death, did not induce necrosis as efficiently. control of macrophage cell-death pathways by mtb has been extensively described as a strategy to avoid innate and adaptive immune responses  <cit> . manipulation of cell-death modality has been successfully used by other intracellular pathogens such as chlamydia, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, shigella flexineri, and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that host-cell apoptosis confers protection to the host, once the uptake of apoptotic bodies derived from macrophages by dendritic cells allows an effective activation of the immune response  <cit> . in contrast, host-cell necrosis can benefit the pathogen because disruption of the cell membrane releases the bacteria to efficiently spread and infect adjacent cells  <cit> . recently, descriptions of the manipulation of cell-death fate by mtb have shown that a virulent bacillus, the h37rv strain, caused macrophage necrosis whereas the attenuated strain h37ra was related to apoptotic death  <cit> . likewise, a ndk-  knockout mtb showed reduced virulence, which was demonstrated by the susceptibility to macrophage microbicidal activity and increased ability to induce host-cell apoptosis  <cit> .

pulmonary macrophages are the primary niches for mtb replication, thus host resistance is critically dependent on innate immune functions played by these cells. in this scenario, proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide  are essential for host control of mtb. macrophage recognition and phagocytosis of mtb stimulates mostly the production of tnf-α, il-1α and β, and il- <dig>  which are fundamental for the resolution of mtb infection in mice  <cit> . our results highlighted the proinflammatory response triggered by 97- <dig> mtb isolate, which induced a higher production of those cytokines by alveolar macrophages than the isolate 97- <dig>  surprisingly, the higher production of proinflammatory cytokines did not result in better outcome for the host cell, as shown by the decreased macrophage survival. stimulation of no generation can cause oxidative stress leading to dysfunction in mitochondrial respiration and also block caspase- <dig> activity by nitrosylation, which may inhibit apoptosis and thereby promote necrosis  <cit> . beyond the effects on the immune response, tnf-α has been associated with necrosis in a caspase-independent mechanism through activation of receptor tnfr <dig> and engagement of rip <dig> kinase  <cit> . recently, it was suggested that alveolar macrophages infected by an attenuated bcg  show high expression of the tnf-α-receptor tnfr <dig> associated with increased cell apoptosis  <cit> . however, in that particular study, only apoptosis rate was analysed and necrosis was not shown. in addition, host-cell necrosis induced by the t3ss pore-forming protein, yopb, from pathogenic yersinia has been associated with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as il-1β and tnf-α  <cit> . these findings support our data showing that proinflammatory cytokines are involved in cell death induced by intracellular bacteria.

activation of the mapk pathway has been directly linked to cytokines production in proinflammatory cell responses to bacterial stimulus  <cit> , including mtb  <cit> . in addition, map kinases have an essential role in production of lipid mediators, such as ltb <dig>  since activation of 5-lo is dependent on phosphorylation mediated by erk1/ <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . in this study, higher phosphorylation of mapk p <dig>  erk1/ <dig>  and jnk1/ <dig> was observed in cells infected with 97- <dig>  although phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> can also be triggered by mammalian plcs, as demonstrated by lps activation of the plc–pkc pathway  <cit> , we observed no differences in plc-γ phosphorylation induced by the mtb isolates 97- <dig> or 97- <dig> when compared to uninfected cells. moreover, different mycobacterial plc isoforms can trigger mapk signalling by directly activating pkc through dag production from cell membrane phospholipids  <cit> . based on these findings, we hypothesise that the differential activation of the mapk pathway in 97-1505-mtb-infected alveolar macrophages may be due to mycobacterial plc actions.

macrophages infected by mycobacteria increase the production of ltb <dig> itself  <cit> , which mediates host immunopathology by enhancing th <dig> responses and by exacerbating inflammation  <cit> . ltb <dig> production induced by both isolates in this study was considerably amplified by plcs; however, no significant differences were observed at the early stages of infection, which suggests that, besides plcs, other mechanisms such as the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines can contribute to immunopathology of mtb infection. the emergent knowledge that the balance in ltb <dig> production is fundamental for the outcome of mtb infection points out that the excessive production of this lipid mediator, associated to dysregulated production of tnf-α, increases mtb susceptibility in the zebrafish model, demonstrated by necrosis of infected macrophages  <cit> . we also found a lower production of pge <dig> to be associated with decreased mrna expression of cox- <dig> and ep-2/ <dig> receptors in mtb 97-1505-infected alveolar macrophages. our group previously demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of cox- <dig> results in increase of ltb <dig> synthesis, during mtb infection in mice  <cit> . in the present study, we show that addition of exogenous ltb <dig> to the culture impairs pge <dig> production by infected cells. these data are in accordance with the concept of a shift in lipid mediator production toward one eicosanoid subpathway  <cit> , which may explain the higher ltb <dig> and lower pge <dig> production observed here. moreover, the finding that down-regulation of pge <dig> and higher necrosis were both impaired after incubation of the isolate 97- <dig> with plc inhibitors, supports the hypothesis that virulent mycobacterium subverts eicosanoid synthesis to manipulate host-cell death to promote proliferation and dissemination  <cit> . here, when exogenous pge <dig> was added to 97-1505-infected alveolar macrophages, the necrosis rate decreased. on the other hand inhibition of pge <dig> by celecoxib enhanced necrosis in cells infected by both isolates. it has been reported that pge2-preventing necrosis is due to pge <dig> involvement in the synthesis of the lysossomal ca2+ sensor syt <dig>  which is essential for prevention of mitochondrial damage, enabling repair of plasma membrane disruption  <cit> . although virulent mycobacteria sabotage of pge <dig> to induce necrosis has been associated with increased production of lxa <dig> <cit> , we did not detect lxa <dig> in the supernatant of mtb-infected alveolar macrophages . nevertheless, the potential relationship between mycobacterial plcs and host-cell necrosis through down-regulation of pge <dig> production shown in this study is new evidence of the relevance of this virulence factor.

indeed, despite the described plc gene polymorphism  <cit> , there is no genome or proteome characterised for either mtb isolate, and further studies are necessary to better understand the differences between 97- <dig> and 97- <dig>  and the role of plc in mtb virulence. however, our data make a valuable demonstration of subversion of lipid mediator synthesis and its association with cell necrosis. furthermore, our data are consistent with the recent finding of bakala n’goma and colleagues  <cit> , who showed for the first time the cytotoxic effect of mycobacterial plcs on macrophages. finally, the relevance of plcs as determinants of virulence in mtb expands our understanding of how these virulence factors can act to the detriment of the host, and highlights eicosanoids, such as pge <dig> and ltb <dig>  as mediators with functions that extend beyond innate immune mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that the mycobacterium tuberculosis bearing plcs genes is more resistant to microbicidal activity of alveolar macrophages and induces cell necrosis, which is associated with subversion of pge <dig> production.
