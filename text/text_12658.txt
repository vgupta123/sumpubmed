BACKGROUND
cholecystokinin stimulates the activity of pancreatic acinar cells via generation of different second messengers in the signal cascades  <cit> . the activation of phospholipase c -linked receptors by cholecystokinin produces an increase in the concentration of inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate  in the cytosol. ip <dig> in turn releases calcium  from cytoplasmic stores leading to an increase in cytosolic free calcium concentration   <cit> . in addition, a co-ordinate influx from the extracellular space  <cit> , ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane  <cit>  as well as ca2+ uptake into intracellular organelles  <cit>  contribute to average ca2+ signals.

a rise in i is an important early signal by which physiological secretagogues elicit the release of digestive enzymes from pancreatic acinar cells, being the spatiotemporal pattern of agonist-induced ca2+ signals of critical importance for exocytosis of enzymes  <cit> . however, although cholecystokinin is a major physiological regulator of secretion by the exocrine pancreas, an over stimulation can cause injury to the pancreas which may lead to dysfunction of the gland and even to activation of death signalling pathways involving caspases  <cit> .

additionally, an impairment of secretion would lead to intracellular activation of digestive enzymes which, in turn, could initiate auto digestion of the gland and surrounding tissues, and to the establishment of an inflammatory disease  <cit> . in relation to this, abnormally elevated i has been proposed to be a shared phenomenon in acute pancreatitis that could induce trypsin premature activation  <cit> .

it has been long recognized that a significant percentage of patients with pancreatitis often presents a history of excessive alcohol consumption. nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying alcohol-derived deleterious effects are not completely understood.

the exocrine pancreas can metabolize ethanol mainly via an oxidative pathway involving the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome p4502e <dig>  although a nonoxidative pathway involving fatty acid ethyl ester synthases has been also proposed  <cit> . therefore, metabolism of ethanol by pancreatic acinar cells and the consequent generation of toxic metabolites are postulated to play an important role in the development of alcohol-related pancreatic injury.

reactive oxygen species  are a molecular group that can be produced in the course of different physiological processes and can react with a large variety of oxidizable cellular components. thus, ros have been considered as pathogenic factors in a variety of tissues and cells, pancreas inclusive  <cit> . nowadays, there is growing evidence indicating that the exocrine pancreas is vulnerable to damage from ros generated by ethanol metabolism  <cit> .

one of the early events leading to alcoholic pancreatitis seems to be the effect of ethanol on stimulus-secretion coupling mechanisms. it has been suggested that ethanol acts to sensitize the pancreas to the deleterious effects of other stimuli such as the physiological agonist cholecystokinin octapeptide , which then leads to an inflammatory response and pancreatitis. this effect is in part mediated by augmenting activation of proinflamatory factors  <cit> , although a decrease in the levels of prostaglandin e <dig> could be as well involved in alcohol-induced injury in the pancreas  <cit> . furthermore, it has been proposed that ethanol induces generation of oxygen radicals in pancreatic acinar cells  <cit> , induces a profound elevation of i via non-oxidative metabolites  <cit> , impairs cck-8-evoked secretion of digestive enzymes  <cit>  and leads to a delayed or reduced ca2+ extrusion from the cytosol towards the extracellular space or into the cytosolic stores  <cit> . however, it was previously proposed that ethanol alone and its oxidative metabolite acetaldehyde have minimal or no effects on ca2+ signalling  <cit> .

we have previously hypothesized that ethanol might exert its deleterious effects in pancreatic acinar cells, at least in part, via generation of ros, although it was not directly demonstrated  <cit> . in addition, despite the great number of investigations carried out to study the action of ethanol on cell physiology, the involvement of ca2+ metabolism in ethanol-evoked effects needs to be further studied, because most cellular activity is initiated by changes in i. in the present study, we have investigated the early effects of acute ethanol exposure on cck-8-evoked ca2+ signals in mouse pancreatic acinar cells. our objective was to shed more light onto the effects of ethanol on the physiological action of cck- <dig>  the findings will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which ethanol causes pancreatic disorders.

RESULTS
changes in i in response to cck- <dig> and effects of ethanol in single cell studies
as it has been previously shown  <cit> , stimulation of fura-2-loaded cells with  <dig> nm cck- <dig>  in the presence of extracellular ca2+, led to a transient increase in i. ca2+ mobilization consisted of an initial increase followed by a decrease of i towards a value close to the prestimulation level . this pattern of ca2+ mobilization was also observed in the absence of ca2+ in the extracellular medium, although, in these conditions, the recovery phase was faster .

when pancreatic acinar cells were stimulated with  <dig> pm cck- <dig>  ca2+ mobilization depicted an oscillatory pattern, which was observed either in the presence  and in the absence  of extracellular ca2+. these patterns of changes in i have been previously observed  <cit> .

perfusion of pancreatic acinar cells with ethanol in the presence of ca2+ in the extracellular medium, led to ca2+ mobilization in the form of oscillations . these changes in i were evoked by  <dig> mm ,  <dig> mm  and  <dig> mm ethanol , and were also observed in the absence of external ca2+ . the effects of ethanol on i did not depict a concentration-dependent effect. in addition, it was not possible to define a pattern for ca2+ mobilization induced by ethanol, because it varied in terms of frequency and amplitude of oscillations, independently of the concentration employed and even at the same concentration of ethanol.

throughout the following determinations, we chose a  <dig> mm ethanol concentration, since it is a concentration falling within the range of blood alcohol levels in intoxicated humans  <cit> . in addition, this concentration of ethanol clearly affected ca2+ transport mechanisms and amylase secretion in response to cck- <dig> in pancreatic acinar cells  <cit> .

in another set of experiments, we evaluated the effect of ethanol on cck-8-evoked ca2+ signals. in the presence of extracellular ca2+, perfusion of cells with  <dig> pm cck- <dig> induced oscillations in i as we have shown above. the amplitude of oscillations progressively decreased after  <dig> minutes in the presence of the peptide. under these conditions, inclusion of  <dig> mm ethanol in the perfusion medium induced a potentiation of cck-8-evoked oscillations in i, observed as an increase in the amplitude of ca2+ spikes .

on the other hand, when  <dig> mm ethanol was first applied to the cells, the oscillatory mobilization of i that we have shown was observed. in the presence of ethanol , perfusion of cells with  <dig> pm cck- <dig> evoked an oscillatory patter of i over an elevated level in the  <dig> % of cells . the majority of cells  showed a single transient change in i, similar to that evoked by the supramaximal concentration of  <dig> nm cck- <dig> .

changes in i in response to cck- <dig> and effect of ethanol in cell-suspension studies
to better analyze the effects of ethanol on cck- <dig> evoked ca2+ mobilization, we performed a series of experiments on cell suspensions, where the behaviour of a population of  <dig> cells/ml was studied. throughout these experiments, pancreatic acinar cells were stimulated with  <dig> nm cck- <dig> alone or in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol.

the time course of changes in i following stimulation of cells with  <dig> nm cck- <dig> in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol can be seen in figure  <dig> 

stimulation of cells with  <dig> nm cck- <dig> in the presence of extracellular ca2+, led to the typical initial increase followed by a decrease of i towards a value close to the prestimulation level. the maximal i calculated at the peak obtained after stimulation of cells with cck- <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm . i reached a steady-state value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm , calculated  <dig> minutes after stimulation with the peptide. the total ca2+ mobilization after the stimulation was estimated to be  <dig> ±  <dig> nm , whereas the decay constant of i to the basal value was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Δnmol/s .

when pancreatic acinar cells were stimulated with cck- <dig>  after  <dig> minute preincubation in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol, the peak of i observed was higher compared to that obtained with cck- <dig> alone . in the presence of ethanol, i reached a significantly higher steady-state value compared to that found in the presence of cck- <dig> alone .

the total ca2+ mobilization evoked by cck- <dig> in the presence of ethanol was significantly increased compared to cck- <dig> alone . in addition, the decay constant of i to the basal value was slowed down in the presence of ethanol, compared to decay observed after application of cck- <dig> alone .

effect of alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition on ethanol-evoked changes in i in response to cck-8
alcohol dehydrogenase  plays an important role in the metabolism of alcohol. the following set of experiments was carried out in order to evaluate whether the effects of ethanol are direct or not. in order to characterize the differences in ca2+ responses between the control experiments with cck- <dig> alone and those performed in the presence of ethanol, it was of interest to investigate the changes in i after inhibition of adh. these experiments were performed on cell suspensions.

under these experimental conditions, cells were preincubated for  <dig> minutes in the presence of the adh inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole   <cit> .

when cells were challenged with  <dig> nm cck- <dig> in the presence of  <dig> mm 4-mp and following  <dig> minute preincubation with  <dig> mm ethanol, the peak i response and the total ca2+ mobilization were significantly increased compared to the values obtained in the presence of cck- <dig> alone. however, the "steady-state level" and the rate of decay of i to basal values did not differ statistically from the values obtained in the presence of cck- <dig> alone .

rate of decay
pancreatic acinar cells were stimulated with  <dig> nm cck- <dig> alone, in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol , after preincubation in the presence of  <dig> mm of the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-mp or following preincubation in the presence of  <dig> μm of the antioxidant cinnamtannin b- <dig> . following cck- <dig> stimulation, the peak i response, the "steady-state level" achieved five minutes after application of the stimulus, the total ca2+ mobilization and the rate of decay of i towards basal values were calculated .

on the other hand, inhibition of adh with  <dig> mm 4-mp in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol, did not significantly change the cck-8-evoked peak i response compared to that obtained after stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with the hormone in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol. however, the "steady-state level" was significantly reduced and the rate of decay of i to basal values was significantly increased, which resulted in a smaller total ca2+ mobilization compared to the responses evoked by  <dig> nm cck- <dig> in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol alone .

effect of ethanol on ros production
it has been shown that ethanol leads to ros production in mouse pancreatic acinar cells  <cit> . to confirm this previous observation, we stimulated mouse pancreatic acinar cells loaded with the ros-sensitive fluorescent probe cm-h2dcfda with  <dig> mm ethanol in the presence of extracellular ca2+. under these conditions, ethanol led to a statistically significant increase in fluorescence, suggesting oxidation of the dye in response to ethanol. the time-course of changes in fluorescence of cm-h2dcfda-loaded cells in response to ethanol can be seen in figure  <dig>  after  <dig> minutes in the presence of ethanol a value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  a.u.  was achieved, which was significantly higher compared to the basal value . at the end of the experiment,  <dig> μm h2o <dig> was added to the cells as a control to show increased fluorescence following additional oxidation of the probe by exogenous h2o <dig> 

in another set of experiments, cells were preincubated in the presence of  <dig> μm of the antioxidant cinnamtannin b- <dig>  this substance is a naturally occurring a-type proanthocyanidin, which belongs to a class of polyphenols that is widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom. these compounds have long been investigated due to the antioxidant functions, which have been shown to involve radical scavenging, quenching, and enzyme-inhibiting actions  <cit> .

pretreatment with  <dig> μm cinnamtannin b- <dig> significantly reduced ethanol-evoked increase in cm-h2dcfda-derived fluorescence by a  <dig> %, although it failed to completely abolish ethanol response on ros production .

effect of ethanol-induced ros generation on cck-8-evoked changes in i
in order to evaluate whether the effects of ethanol on i are mediated by a secondary ros generation, we investigated the changes in i in the presence of the antioxidant cinnamtannin b- <dig>  the time course of changes in i following stimulation of cells with  <dig> nm cck- <dig> in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol and in the presence of  <dig> μm cinnamtannin b- <dig> can be seen in figure  <dig> 

when cells were challenged with  <dig> nm cck- <dig> after preincubation during  <dig> minutes in the presence of  <dig> μm cinnamtannin b- <dig>  and following  <dig> minute preincubation with  <dig> mm ethanol, the peak i response and the total ca2+ mobilization were significantly increased compared to the values obtained in the presence of cck- <dig> alone. however, the "steady-state level" and the rate of decay of i to basal values did not differ statistically from the values obtained in the presence of cck- <dig> alone .

on the other hand, stimulation of cells with  <dig> nm cck- <dig> in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol, and after  <dig> minutes preincubation in the presence of cinnamtannin b- <dig> , did not significantly change the cck-8-evoked peak i response compared to that obtained after stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with the hormone in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol alone. however, the "steady-state level" was significantly decreased and the rate of decay of i to basal values was significantly increased in the presence of cinnamtannin b- <dig>  which resulted in a smaller total ca2+ mobilization compared to the responses evoked by  <dig> nm cck- <dig> in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol alone .

discussion
alcohol consumption has long been associated with cell damage. many studies on ethanol toxicity have been conducted following middle or long term exposition to ethanol  <cit> . however, attention on the early steps initiated by ethanol is currently lacking. furthermore, although relevant studies have been performed on the effect of ethanol on the oxidative state of cellular components and/or apoptosis  <cit> , its effects on ca2+ homeostasis have not received much attention.

to date, it is not clear whether the deleterious actions of ethanol on cellular physiology could result from the production of toxic derivatives from alcohol metabolism or from a direct action of alcohol on cellular structures, which would be morphologically and functionally altered  <cit> .

recently we have shown that ethanol, leading to a delayed or reduced ca2+ extrusion from the cytosol towards the extracellular space or into the cytosolic stores, induces a cytosolic ca2+ overload that could be the basis of alcoholic pancreatitis  <cit> . however, the mechanisms by which ethanol exerted its effect was not clearly demonstrated, although it was postulated that ros generation might be involved in the process.

in the present study, we have further investigated the possible mechanisms involved in the early effects of an acute ethanol exposure on cck-8-evoked ca2+ signals in mouse pancreatic acinar cells, because ca2+ signalling is of critical importance for cck-8-evoked responses in the exocrine pancreas.

our results show that ethanol induces mobilization of ca2+ in the form of oscillations, a pattern of ca2+ mobilization that seems not to depend on the concentration of ethanol applied to the cells. to our knowledge, this is the first time to be shown that ethanol induces ca2+ mobilization in pancreatic acinar cells at such concentrations,  <dig> to  <dig> mm, being the highest a concentration of ethanol found in plasma of intoxicated humans  <cit> . in a former work, higher concentrations of ethanol were employed, up to  <dig> mm, and effects of lower concentrations were discarded  <cit> . in addition, here we show that ethanol leads to a transformation of the typical oscillatory pattern of i, evoked by a physiological concentration of cck- <dig>  into a sustained response usually evoked by supraphysiological concentrations of the agonist. our results support previously reported works, which propose that ethanol-induced sensitization of the pancreatic acinar cell results in pancreatitis responses with low doses of cck- <dig>  that by itself does not cause pancreatitis  <cit> . our observations further support those shown by petersen and sutton  <cit> , who propose that cell death results from excessive loss of ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, which is mediated by ca2+ release through specific channels and inhibition of ca2+ pumps in intracellular stores, followed by entry of extracellular ca2+. all this together leads to abnormal global and sustained cytosolic ca2+ signals.

in the present work, we have further studied the mechanisms by which ethanol evokes its deleterious effects in pancreatic acinar cells, in order to clarify whether the effects of ethanol are direct or mediated through its metabolization, and if ros are somehow involved.

the inhibition of alcohol metabolization would increase those effects that are due to a direct action of ethanol, whereas it would block those effects of ethanol that would be due to its metabolites. through our study, we have employed the adh inhibitor 4-mp. this compound substantially decreased ethanol effects on connective tissue growth factor mrna expression in mouse pancreatic stellate cells  <cit> . inhibition of adh by 4-mp is concentration-dependent, with a range of action from  <dig> μm up to  <dig> μm in different tissues  <cit> . thus, the concentration of the adh inhibitor we have employed falls within the concentration range successfully employed to inhibit ethanol metabolization by this enzyme.

our results show that the effect of ethanol on the peak i response evoked by cck- <dig> was not blocked by the inhibition of ethanol metabolization by adh; conversely, it was slightly increased. however, the "steady-state level" and the rate of decay of i to basal values after cck- <dig> stimulation in the presence of ethanol were significantly changed, i.e., i recovered faster in the presence of adh inhibition.

our results could be explained on the basis of a direct action of ethanol onto the ca2+-releasing mechanisms activated by cck- <dig>  and by an indirect action, mediated through ethanol metabolites, on the i recovery mechanisms. we think that ethanol itself sensitizes the pancreas to the effects of other stimuli such as the physiological agonist cck- <dig>  acting on cck-8-receptor or on the ca2+ releasing channels. this could initially have an effect on the ca2+ releasing mechanisms, and therefore would result in a bigger ca2+ response of the tissue. this is reflected as a transformation of the physiological oscillations in i into a supraphysiological sustained change in i, and by the higher peak of i observed in the presence of ethanol.

on the other hand, the recovery of i is mainly carried out by the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase and the plasma membrane ca2+-atpase, the pumps that actively transport ca2+ into the endoplasmic reticulum and towards the extracellular medium respectively. a delay or decreased extrusion of ca2+ from the cytosol will lead to an increased mobilization of ca2+ compared to normal conditions. this can potentially lead to a cytosolic ca2+ overload. thus, t decrease in the generation of ethanol metabolites by inhibition of its metabolization would allow the ca2+ transport mechanisms to effectively recover resting i, as we have shown in the present study.

this is in agreement with our previous findings, which show that ethanol slows down ca2+ transport into the er and through the plasma membrane, which potentially leads to a cytosolic ca2+ overload  <cit> . however, the exact mechanisms by which ethanol evokes these effects need to be further clarified.

the antioxidant activity of proanthocyanidins is stronger than vitamin c or vitamin e in aqueous systems and its protective effects on diseases related to ros have been demonstrated in a number of cell types  <cit> . our results show that ethanol induces ros production in mouse pancreatic acinar cells, in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . moreover, preincubation of pancreatic acinar cells in the presence of cinnamtanninb- <dig> significantly inhibited ethanol-stimulated ros generation. this supports the hypothesis that ethanol metabolization could lead to ros generation which, in turn, would affect ca2+ transport mechanisms, and is in agreement with our previous findings  <cit> .

on the other side, preincubation of pancreatic acinar cells in the presence of this antioxidant did not block ethanol-induced increase in the peak of i in response to cck- <dig>  this further supports the hypothesis that ethanol might be having direct effects on the ca2+-releasing mechanisms in response to cck- <dig>  as suggested above. however, in the presence of the antioxidant, the "steady-state level" achieved after stimulation of cells with the hormone was lowered compared to that observed in the presence of ethanol, and the rate of decay of i to basal values after cck- <dig> stimulation was faster than in the presence of ethanol, reaching values similar to those observed after stimulation of cells with cck- <dig> alone. this supports the hypothesis that ethanol metabolization could lead to ros generation which, in turn, would affect ca2+ transport mechanisms.

therefore, here we can hypothesize that ethanol influences cck-8-evoked changes in i both by a direct and an indirect action, the latter mediated through ros generation. our findings are in agreement with others which show that ethanol can induce several cellular reactions which result in a modification of cellular red-ox status, leading to overproduction of ros  <cit> . nevertheless, involvement of non-oxidative metabolites from ethanol cannot be excluded.

in summary, our findings show that ethanol has dual effects on the physiology of intracellular ca2+ signalling. first, ethanol induces a direct effect on the ca2+ release mechanisms in response to cck-8; and second, ethanol presents an indirect effect that is mediated, at least in part, by ros generation following its metabolization. all this together leads to higher levels of i following stimulation of cells with cck- <dig>  ethanol will consequently lead to ca2+ accumulation within the cytosol, creating a situation potentially leading to cytosolic ca2+ overload, which is a common pathological precursor that mediates pancreatitis.

CONCLUSIONS
ethanol may lead, either directly or through ros generation, to an over stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells in response to cck- <dig>  resulting in a higher ca2+ mobilization compared to normal conditions. the actions of ethanol on cck-8-stimulation of cells create a situation potentially leading to ca2+ overload, which is a common pathological precursor that mediates pancreatitis.
