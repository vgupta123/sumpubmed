BACKGROUND
metabotropic glutamate receptors  are class c g protein coupled receptors with widespread expression in the mammalian nervous system  <cit> . as such, mglurs are involved in many neural processes regulating important physiological and pathological processes. compared with many g protein coupled receptor subtypes, mglurs have relatively low affinity/potency for their native ligand, glutamate  <cit> . most mglurs exhibit kd or ec <dig> values from the low to mid micromolar range  <cit> . this is likely the case because basal extracellular glutamate levels in the nervous system tend to be relatively high  <cit> . the group iii mglur, mglur <dig> exhibits the lowest potency of any mglur, with estimates in the hundreds of micromolar to low millimolar range, with full activation requiring nearly 10 mm glutamate  <cit> . thus, it is difficult to understand the physiological role of a receptor that may only rarely get fully activated. here evidence is presented that when mglur <dig> is expressed in neurons, it shows a detectable level of constitutive activity. this activity appeared to be relatively low compared to full activation of the receptor, and was reduced when other group iii mglurs were coexpressed. it was further demonstrated that mglur <dig> constitutive signaling can be inhibited by the selective mglur <dig> antagonist mmpip  <cit> , and also by the mglur <dig> selective agonist ppg  <cit> .

methods
scg neuron isolation, cdna injection, and plasmids
the neuronal isolation and injection procedures have been previously described  <cit> . briefly, scg were dissected from adult wistar rats and incubated in earle’s balanced salt solution  with  <dig>  mg/ml trypsin ,  <dig>  mg/ml type iv collagenase  for 1 hour at 35°c. cells were then spun twice, transferred to minimum essential medium , plated, and incubated at 37°c until cdna injection. cdna injections was performed with an eppendorf  <dig> microinjector and injectman ni <dig> micromanipulator  4– <dig> hours following cell isolation. plasmids were stored at −20°c as a 1–2 μg/μl stock solution in te buffer . the mglur <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clones  were obtained from cdna.org . concentrations of cdnas injected were as indicated in the text. all neurons were co-injected with green fluorescent protein cdna  for identification of expressing cells. cells were the incubated overnight at 37°c and experiments are performed the following day. all animal protocols were approved by the university of rochester’s committee on animal resources .

electrophysiology and data analysis
patch-clamp recordings were made using  <dig> glass . pipette resistances were  <dig> - <dig> mΩ yielding uncompensated series resistances of 1– <dig> mΩ. series resistance compensation of ≥ 80% was used in all recordings. data was recorded using an axopatch 1d patch-clamp amplifier from axon . voltage protocol generation and data acquisition were performed using custom procedures written for the igor pro software software package  by stephen r. ikeda  on a macmini intel duocore computer with an instrutech itc <dig> data acquisition board . currents were sampled at 100 khz low-pass filtered at 5 khz, digitized, and stored on the computer for later analysis. all patch-clamp experiments were performed at 21–24°c . data analysis was performed using igor pro software . the external  calcium current recording solution contained : <dig> tetraethylammonium  methanesulfonate , <dig> 4--1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid ,  <dig> glucose,  <dig> cacl <dig>  and  <dig> nm tetrodotoxin, ph  <dig> , osmolality 320 mosm/kg. the internal  solution contained: 120 n-methyl-dglucamine  ms,  <dig> tea,  <dig> egta,  <dig> hepes,  <dig> sucrose,  <dig> cacl <dig>   <dig> mgatp,  <dig>  na2gtp, and  <dig> tris-creatine phosphate, ph  <dig> , osmolality 300 mosm/kg. l-ap <dig>  6--5-methyl-3--isoxazolopyridin-4-one hydrochloride , and -4-phosphonophenylglycine  were obtained from tocris bioscience .

RESULTS
modulation of scg calcium currents by mglur7
to examine its signaling, mglur <dig> cdna was injected into nuclei of isolated scg neurons from the adult rat along with egfp to identify successfully injected cells  <cit> . the following day, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made in expressing cells under conditions designed to isolate currents through the native, mostly n-type  <cit> , calcium channels. because mglur <dig> couples to the gi/o family  <cit> , calcium current was expected to be robust and mediated by gβγ subunits upon receptor activation. indeed, application of the group iii mglur selective agonist l-ap <dig>  produced a strong, reversible inhibition of the scg calcium currents . sample control and 1 mm l-ap <dig> inhibited current traces obtained during a 25 msec test pulse to +10 mv are shown in the inset of figure 1a. as illustrated by the example cell shown in figure 1a as well as the average l-ap <dig> dose–response curve in figure 1b , mglur <dig> responded with relatively low potency to this agonist, exhibiting an apparent ic <dig> of about 170 μm. this is about  <dig> fold lower potency than that observed with other group iii mglurs  <cit> . activation of mglur <dig> by glutamate, the natural ligand also requires considerably more agonist than other mglurs  <cit> , suggesting that mglur <dig> is a low potency receptor in general. it should be noted that the response did not reach saturation even at 2 mm l-ap <dig>  however at higher concentrations, l-ap <dig> was not soluble. the response of uninjected scg neurons to 1 mm l-ap <dig> is also shown in figure 1b . these cells showed no detectable response to l-ap <dig>  indicating that the responses observed were due to heterologously expressed mglur <dig> figure  <dig>

mglur <dig> exhibits constitutive activity
the mechanism of calcium current inhibition in rat scg neurons by gi/o coupled receptors, such as mglur <dig>  is via direct interaction of active gβγ with the channel’s pore forming subunit  <cit> . bean first characterized this modulation by proposing a model in which uninhibited channels gate in a “willing” mode that allows channel opening at moderate voltages  <cit> . inhibition causes the channels to enter a “reluctant” gating mode that requires stronger depolarization to open the channels. these mechanistic features give rise to a few unique characteristics. the first is the appearance of a slow activation phase at moderate membrane potentials evident in the sample current trace in figure  <dig> . the second is a temporary relief of inhibition following strong depolarizations. both of these features are diagnostic hallmarks of gβγ-mediated calcium channel inhibition, and both are thought to result at least in part from the physical dissociation of gβγ from the channels at more depolarized potentials  <cit> . finally, modulation of each member of the cav <dig> x family has been shown to occur through this pathway  <cit> .

by employing a triple-pulse voltage protocol  <cit>  , the degree to which this pathway is active can be monitored in real time. this protocol consists of two 25 msec test pulses to +10 mv. the first  precedes a 45 msec conditioning pulse to +80 mv, and the other  follows it after a brief, 5 msec step back to −80 mv. since the conditioning pulse can transiently relieve gβγ inhibition, the facilitation ratio  provides a real time measure of the degree to which this pathway is active. this approach has the added advantage of allowing an objective measure of the gβγ pathway even in the absence of receptor agonists. for example, higher levels of constitutive receptor activity will produce more free gβγ, which produces a greater inhibition and thus a higher facilitation ratio.figure  <dig>

interestingly, scg neurons made to express mglur <dig> exhibited a significantly higher basal facilitation ratio  than neurons expressing mglur <dig> and recorded on the same days . cells expressing mglur <dig> had a basal facilitation ratio of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig>   cells expressing mglur <dig>  and recorded on the same days. these data suggest that mglur <dig> exhibits some degree of constitutive signaling in the absence of agonist which results in a higher than average amount of free gβγ.

the basal facilitation value of the mglur <dig> expressing cells was indistinguishable from a larger group of control cells obtained on separate days , including uninjected cells and those expressing mglur <dig>  mglur <dig> or both receptors together. the pooled results from these cells are shown in figure 2a and b, labeled “control.” the average basal facilitation of these control neurons was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . interestingly, when mglur <dig> and  <dig> were co-expressed in the same neurons, the basal facilitation resembled control cells at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , suggesting that constitutive signaling of mglur <dig> is inhibited by the presence of mglur <dig>  although the mechanism of this phenomenon is not known.

next, the degree to which mglur <dig> signaled constitutively was investigated. while basal facilitation was elevated in mglur <dig> expressing cells, the facilitation ratio in these neurons was not high compared with that seen in cells over-expressing gβγ  <cit> , or in the presence of saturating concentrations of agonists of gi/o coupled receptors  <cit> . indeed, when the facilitation ratio that resulted from application of various concentrations of l-ap <dig> was plotted, it can be seen that this value could be increased to over  <dig>  by even the somewhat sub-saturating concentrations of 300 μm - 2 mm l-ap <dig> . thus, it can be concluded that while mglur <dig> does appear to signal constitutively, the degree of activation is relatively subtle compared with full activation of the receptor.

inhibition of mglur <dig> constitutive activity with an inverse agonist
if the elevated basal facilitation observed in mglur <dig> expressing sympathetic neurons was in fact due to elevated mglur <dig> signaling in the absence of agonist, then the facilitation should be reduced and current should be slightly enhanced upon application of an antagonist with inverse agonist properties. to test this prediction, the mglur <dig> selective antagonist 6--5-methyl-3--isoxazolopyridin-4-one hydrochloride  was used  <cit> . as shown in the sample cell in figure 3a, application of  <dig> nm mmpip to an mglur <dig> expressing scg neuron did in fact both transiently enhance the basal current level and reduce facilitation, consistent with a reduction in constitutive signaling of the receptors in that cell. sample current traces  show control and l-ap <dig> inhibited currents using the triple pulse voltage protocol described above  and control and mmpip enhanced current traces  from the same cell. note that while mmpip enhanced the current in the prepulse, it did not detectably alter the postpulse current, thereby resulting in a smaller post/pre ratio. figure 3b  shows post/pre ratio values for all of the mglur <dig> expressing cells in which  <dig> nm mppip was applied. in these cells, mmpip significantly reduced the facilitation ratio from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the absolute magnitude of the prepulse current was also enhanced in these cells from − <dig>  ± .22 na to − <dig>  ±  <dig>  na. by contrast, when  <dig> nm mmpip was applied to control, uninjected scg neurons, the current amplitude was not significantly enhanced and the facilitation ratio was not significantly reduced. current amplitude of control cells was − <dig>  ± .1 na in control and − <dig>  ± .11 na in mmpip. the facilitation ratio was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in control and mmpip, respectively , suggesting that the effects of mmpip were due to the expression of mglur <dig> figure  <dig>

interestingly, while mmpip appeared to effectively reduce constitutive mglur <dig> activity, the same concentration of mmpip did not effectively inhibit l-ap <dig> activation of the receptor in the 100 μm - 1 mm range . in scg neurons expressing mglur <dig>  100 μm and 1 mm l-ap <dig> were applied and washed off to obtain control agonist responses  in the same cells, 100 μm, 300 μm, and 1 mm l-ap <dig> were applied in the presence of  <dig> nm mmpip . responses in the presence of mmpip were not significantly reduced compared to control responses. this result was in contrast with those reported by suzuki et al.  <cit> , in which  <dig> nm mmpip was effective as both an inverse agonist and in inhibiting l-ap <dig> responses. the reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but in this study the human mglur <dig> clone was transiently expressed in rat scg neurons, while in that study, rat mglur <dig> was stably expressed in chinese hamster ovary  cells. it is possible that affinity of mmpip for human mglur <dig> is slightly lower than for the rat sequence. unfortunately, application of higher concentrations of mmpip in the scg calcium current assay was problematic due to solubility issues and direct effects of the solvent  on calcium currents.

effect of an mglur <dig> selective agonist on mglur7
fortuitously, the mglur <dig> selective agonist -4-phosphonophenylglycine   <cit>  was also applied to scg neurons expressing mglur <dig>  similar to the effect of mmpip, 1 μm ppg also significantly reduced the facilitation ratio in mglur <dig> expressing cells, suggesting that it may also act as an inverse agonist at these receptors . in mglur <dig> expressing scg neurons, application of 1 μm ppg reduced the facilitation ratio from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . as a positive control, ppg was also applied to scg neurons expressing mglur <dig> . in these cells, the group iii mglur agonist l-ap <dig>  produced a 20 ± 2% inhibition of the calcium current . the current was inhibited similarly, 27 ± 7%, by 1 μm ppg in the same cells, confirming the agonistic activity of ppg. interestingly, in the same cells, application of  <dig> nm mmpip also appeared to function as an agonist, as it induced a reversible inhibition of the calcium current of 32 ± 6%. thus despite their structural dissimilarity, both mmpip and ppg appear to act as inverse agonists at mglur <dig> and agonists at mglur <dig>  two receptors with relatively high homology.

finally, 1 mm l-ap <dig>   <dig> nm mmpip, and 1 μm ppg were applied to scg neurons co-expressing both mglur <dig> and mglur <dig> . it should first be noted that these neurons did not exhibit elevated basal facilitation as the cells expressing mglur <dig> alone did. the facilitation ratio in mglur7/ <dig> expressing neurons was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , consistent with the observation  that co-expression of mglur <dig> with mglur <dig> eliminated constitutive activity. however, in the mglur7/ <dig> expressing neurons, both mmpip and ppg had effects similar to those in cells expressing mglur <dig> alone. that is, each slightly enhanced the current amplitude by 9 ± 4% , suggesting that while the basal facilitation ratio was not strongly elevated, some constitutive signaling may have been occurring. indeed, the facilitation ratio was reduced in these cells from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  by  <dig> nm mmpip and from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  by 1 μm ppg. together, these data indicate that the mglur <dig> selective agonist ppg may act as an inverse agonist on mglur <dig>  and that the mglur <dig> inverse agonist can act as an agonist at mglur <dig> 

discussion
in the current study, the signaling properties of mglur <dig> were examined adult rat sympathetic neurons from the scg. group iii mglurs like mglur <dig> couple to gi/o proteins, which mediate a strong, reversible inhibition of cav <dig> channels  <cit>  mediated by gβγ  <cit> . because gβγ-mediated calcium current inhibition exhibits a characteristic voltage dependence  <cit> , assessment of active g protein levels in the presence and absence of receptor ligand is possible using a simple ‘triple-pulse’ voltage protocol  <cit> . using this strategy, it was shown that scg neurons expressing mglur <dig> by intranuclear cdna injection exhibited significantly higher than normal levels of free, active gβγ, suggesting that expressed mglur <dig> may be constitutively signaling. similar results were not observed in control, uninjected neurons, nor in neurons expressing other mglur subtypes. thus suggests that the elevated levels of apparent mglur <dig> activation were not likely due to elevated levels of glutamate in the extracellular environment, as the potency of mglur <dig> for glutamate is considerably lower than every other mglur subtype  <cit> . the degree of constitutive activation of mglur <dig> was limited however, since application of the agonist l-ap <dig> consistently further activated the receptor, and produced a greater level of calcium current inhibition than was observed in the absence of ligand.

the suggestion that mglur <dig> signals constitutively was confirmed by application of the mglur <dig> inverse agonist mmpip, which consistently increased current amplitudes in mglur <dig> expressing cells, but not in uninjected cells. further, mmpip significantly reduced the current facilitation ratio, an independent measure of the degree of active gβγ in the cells. these data suggest that the elevated gβγ levels in mglur <dig> expressing scg neurons were the result of signaling of mglur <dig> at the level of the receptor, and not likely a secondary effect of mglur <dig> over-expression.

the observation that mglur <dig> can signal constitutively has been posited previously  <cit> , but that observation came only from mglur <dig> expressed in cho cells pretreated with forskolin, a somewhat less physiological system than the one employed here. indeed, another study  <cit>  showed elevated calcium channel facilitation in cerebellar granule neurons that was inhibited by the mglur <dig> binding protein macmarcks. however in that study, untransfected neurons had similar channel facilitation as mglur <dig> transfected cells, despite the fact that the authors could not detect somatic mglur <dig> in untransfected cells. therefore, the authors could neither confirm nor refute the potential constitutive activity of mglur <dig> in those cells. thus this is the first definitive demonstration of constitutive mglur <dig> signaling in neurons.

in addition to the inhibition of mglur <dig> constitutive activity by the inverse agonist mmpip, the effect of the selective mglur <dig> agonist ppg was also examined. surprisingly, ppg showed similar responses when applied as mmpip, both in inhibiting mglur <dig> activity and in its agonist activity at mglur <dig>  suggesting that these two relatively dissimilar compounds have similar activities at both receptors. it is likely however, that the similar responses induced by these compounds are coincidental because mmpip binds at least mglur <dig> at an allosteric site, while ppg has some structural similarity to glutamate and l-ap <dig>  and likely functions as an orthosteric agonist at mglur <dig>  mmpip likely acts on mglur <dig> as an allosteric agonist, or possibly as an ago-pam , although there is currently no evidence for pam activity of mmpip at mglur <dig> 

a surprising and as yet little understood phenomenon is the abolishment or reduction of apparent mglur <dig> constitutive activity when other group iii mglurs were coexpressed. expression of mglur <dig> with mglur <dig> strongly reduced basal facilitation values to control levels, and mglur <dig> expression reduced facilitation somewhat as well. one possible explanation might be that mglur <dig> forms heterodimers with mglur <dig> and  <dig>  and that mglur <dig> containing dimers do not exhibit constitutive signaling. while we do not have data to thoroughly address this claim here, there are some hints in the pharmacological data that could lead to at least some informed hypotheses. in figure 3c, it is clear that both mmpip and ppg produce similar effects as when mglur <dig> is expressed alone, but the reduced basal facilitation  suggests that at least some mglur <dig> is expressed. one interpretation is that mglur7/ <dig> heterodimers are predominantly expressed and that these are affected by mmpip and ppg similarly to mglur <dig> homodimers. however, since mmpip is an allosteric compound and ppg likely acts at the orthosteric site, this explanation may be unlikely. perhaps the more likely scenario is that under these conditions, a small number of mglur7/ <dig> heterodimers are expressed with a reduced  number of mglur <dig> homodimers. this would explain the reduced facilitation values, the enhancement of current by both drugs, and the lack of a clear agonist effect of the drugs as well. the mechanism of the reduced facilitation ratio when mglur <dig> was expressed with mglur <dig> also remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study demonstrate that mglur <dig> can signal constitutively  when expressed in neurons. this constitutive signaling appears to be reduced when mglur <dig> is coexpressed with another group iii mglur.
