BACKGROUND
stat <dig> belongs to the signal transducers and activators of transcription  family of transcription factors   <cit> . stat <dig> is activated in response to several cytokines and growth factors, including il- <dig>  epidermal growth factor , and interferon  α; stat <dig> is also weakly activated in response to other cytokines, including ifnγ. activation of stat <dig> results from the phosphorylation of tyrosine  <dig>  mediated by janus kinases , which are associated to cytokine receptors, and also by the src and abelson  families of protein tyrosine kinases  <cit> . stat <dig> is also phosphorylated on serine  <dig>  sometimes resulting in its activation. following phosphorylation, stat <dig> dimerizes and enters the nucleus by interacting with nuclear import proteins  <cit>  of the karyopherin/importin family  <cit> . the importins interact with nuclear localization signals , one of which is located within the dna binding domain  of stat <dig> and is thought to be the most efficient  <cit> . once in the nucleus, stat <dig> activates the transcription of its target genes, including cyclin d <dig>  survivin, vegf, c-myc, bcl-xl, and bcl <dig> . once released from its dna targets, stat <dig> is dephosphorylated in the nucleus  <cit>  and exported to the cytoplasm by a crm1-dependent process  <cit> . stat <dig> has been described as a key regulator of cell survival and proliferation  <cit> ; its constitutive activation has been observed in many human tumors, including colon, breast, lung, pancreas and prostate cancers, melanoma, head and neck squamous carcinoma, multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and glioma  <cit> . in addition, substituting amino acids located at the stat <dig> dimer interface for cysteines yielded a stabilized stat <dig> dimer that was able to induce a pseudotransformed phenotype  <cit> . thus, its constitutive activation in tumor cells points to stat <dig> as a valuable target for attacking tumor cells. furthermore, despite its essential role in development  <cit> , stat <dig> is not essential for the functioning of mature cells  <cit> . some stat <dig> inhibitors are not specific, such as curcumin  <cit> . in contrast, stattic, which prevents stat <dig> dimerization by specifically interacting with its sh <dig> domain  <cit> , is highly specific, and efficiently induces tumor cell death  <cit> . despite its frequent involvement in cancer, which makes it a highly valuable target for inducing tumor cell death, stat <dig> still lacks more specific inhibitors. besides the sh <dig> domain, another potential target for highly selective stat <dig> inhibitors is its dbd, since it selectively recognizes and binds dna motifs in target genes. decoy oligonucleotides  containing the tfs' dna binding consensus sequences selectively inhibit them by binding to the dbd  <cit> . they can induce, in vitro, the death of tumor cells whose growth depends on these tfs  <cit> . this has notably been shown for several tfs, including nf-κb  <cit>  and stat <dig>  <cit> . stat3-decoy odn efficiently induced cell death in mouse xenografts of a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> . one limitation of stat3-decoy odn is that despite the different functions of stat <dig> and stat <dig> in the cell, they recognize very similar dna targets  <cit> , with the result that stat3-decoy odn can inhibit either one or the other. for example, in the colon carcinoma cell line sw  <dig>  the constitutive activation of stat <dig> contributes to cell survival; its inhibition by stat3-decoy odn induces cell death. however, the odn also blocks ifnγ-mediated cell death through stat <dig> activation in the same cell line  <cit> . the actual mechanism through which decoy odns inhibit tfs is still unclear. of the many studies demonstrating decoy odn-mediated inhibition of tfs such as e2f, nf-κb  <cit> , cre and ap <dig>  <cit> , none have specifically investigated the subcellular localization required for decoy odns to exercise their inhibitory action. a study on ap <dig> suggested that nuclear entry is required for decoy odns to inhibit targeted tfs  <cit> . another study showed that a decoy odn engineered to contain a nuclear localization signal  could enter the nucleus and efficiently inhibit p <dig>  <cit> . it is not clear yet whether these requirements depend on cellular systems or on the tfs that are targeted, since other studies have found that decoy odns did not have to enter the nucleus to exert their inhibitory effect  <cit> . in order to assess their possible use in human cancer, it will be important to understand the mechanism through which the decoy odns interfere with tfs and to determine whether nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling is impaired. in the case of stat <dig>  constitutive shuttling from cytoplasm to nucleus has been demonstrated  <cit> . furthermore, stat3's localization seems to be predominantly nuclear  <cit> , indicating that the shuttling mechanism could be a promising target for achieving effective stat <dig> inhibition, as previously suggested  <cit> . decoy odns' mechanism of action on stat <dig> was therefore studied to determine whether nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling was impaired, leading to stat <dig> inhibition. finally, since stat <dig> has been reported to interact and synergize with nf-κb  <cit>  in tumor cells  <cit> , this study also addresses the functional interplay of nf-κb and decoy odn.

methods
cell culture and reagents
sw  <dig>  and mcf- <dig>  cell lines were grown in dmem , supplemented with 10% fcs   <dig> u/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin ,  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate , mem vitamins  <dig> ×  and  <dig> μg/ml plasmocin . the kg- <dig> cells were grown in 10% fcs supplemented imdm medium . for the stat <dig> overexpression experiments the plasmid plzst3α was used. the stat <dig> dna binding domain -mutant containing two mutations in the dbd that completely prevented dna binding but allowed dimerization and nuclear entry, was a kind gift from dr. c. horvath   <cit> . for some experiments, cells were treated with tnfα  . to enhance stat <dig> activation, cells were treated for  <dig> hr with il- <dig>  . sodium orthovanadate   was from fischer , leptomycin b   was from sigma-aldrich.

rna silencing
for cell infection with lentiviral shrna, a set of two stat1-targeting shrnas that has previously been found to reduce the expression of stat <dig>  <cit>  was used and transduced as previously described  <cit> . efficiency of infection was verified by measuring gfp by flow cytometry, and the efficacy of the inhibition of the shrna's inhibition of stat <dig> expression was verified by western blotting using a stat1-specific antibody .

for sirna stat <dig> silencing, the following double stranded sirna oligonucleotide, previously shown to suppress stat <dig> expression in a colorectal cell line  <cit> , was purchased from sigma-aldrich: 5'-aacaucugccuagaucggcuadtdt-3'; 3'-dtdtguagacggaucuagccgau-5', along with a universal control set of sirna . cells  were transfected using polyethylene imine  with  <dig> nm sirna in culture medium without antibiotics. after  <dig> h or  <dig> h, cells were harvested and analyzed for annexin v binding by flow cytometry. in control cells, the irrelevant control sirna was used. all experiments were performed in triplicate.

preparation of subcellular fractions
cells  were resuspended in cell lysis buffer containing  <dig> mm hepes ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> % np <dig>   <dig>  mm dtt,  <dig>  mm edta and protease inhibitors , and placed at 4°c for  <dig> min. the lysates were centrifuged at  <dig> g for  <dig> min at 4°c, and the supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was stored in aliquots at -80°c. the pellets were resuspended in cell lysis buffer adjusted to 20% glycerol and  <dig>  m nacl and placed at 4°c for  <dig> min. after centrifugation at  <dig> g for  <dig> min at 4°c, the supernatant, containing the nuclear proteins, was stored at -80°c. protein amounts were determined before use with the micro-bca protein determination kit .

decoy oligonucleotides
the stat3-decoy odns used were: rhn6- catttcccgtaaatcgaagatttacgggaaatg -3nhr , derived from the serum-inducible element of the human c-fos promoter  <cit> , and rhn6- catttgccacaatcgaagattgtggcaaatg -3nhr   where r was either h, fitc or biotin. the decoy nf-κb-odn consisted of: rnh6-ctggaaagtccctcgaagagggactttccag-3nhr  and rhn6-tgcagtcactacgcgaagcgtagtgactgca-3nhr  where r is either h or biotin. the synthesis of decoy oligonucleotides with r = h has been published elsewhere  <cit> . for biotin addition, 7- <dig> nanomoles of the oligodeoxynucleotide bearing 3'- and 5'-aminoalkyl linkers were dissolved in  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m nahco <dig>  ez-link nhs-biotin   was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 6- <dig> h in the dark. then  <dig> μl of water were added, and the modified oligodeoxynucleotide was separated from the excess of hydrolyzed reagent by two consecutive separations on micro bio-spin  <dig> columns following the manufacturer's recommendations. after the second spin, the biotinylated oligodeoxynucleotide was precipitated with ethanol-sodium acetate. in control experiments the previously published decoy nf-κb-odn  <cit>  was used. in some cases fitc-labeled or biotinylated decoy odns were obtained from sigma-aldrich. note that the oligonucleotides used for cell death induction, pull-down assays and whole-cell pull-down assays were similar and could be used interchangeably, except that for pull-down biotinylated oligonucleotides had to be used.

preparation of liposomes
liposomes were formulated using a cationic lipid -carbamoyl] cholesterol) iodide  and neutral colipid dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine , as previously described  <cit> . the concentration of cationic lipid was monitored by uv spectroscopy at  <dig> nm and the value was used to calculate the charge ratio assuming one positive charge for each cationic lipid molecule.

gel electrophoresis, western blotting
cells were washed in pbs, lysed in sample buffer , 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate  , 20% glycerol ,  <dig> mm sodium vanadate ,  <dig> mm dithiothreitritol   and  <dig> % bromophenol blue , sonicated and stored at -70°c. proteins  were separated on sds-page  and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes; membranes blocked with 5% dry skimmed milk in tbs were incubated with antibody overnight at 4°c. anti-phosphotyrosine 705-stat <dig> , anti-stat <dig> , anti-nf-κb p <dig> , anti-nf-κb p <dig> , anti-stat <dig> , and anti-oct <dig>  were from cell signaling, anti-karyopherin/importin α  was from santa cruz . blots were washed in tbs-t, incubated with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse  or goat anti-rabbit  secondary antibody  washed in tbs-t and revealed by chemiluminescence  and autoradiography . when necessary, membranes were stripped with blot restore kit  and reprobed with anti-actin antibody . prestained molecular weight standards  were used. for the quantification analysis, the bands from at least three separate experiments were scanned using a chemidoc apparatus  and quantification performed using the quantity one software . p-values were calculated using a t test.

real-time qpcr
the taqman® gene expression cells-to-ct™ kit  was used to extract total rna and to perform reverse transcription and gene amplification. an applied biosystems custom taqman gene expression assay was used; the sequences were chosen to cover exons  <dig> and  <dig> to avoid detecting genomic dna: sense primer: 5'-ccatcttcatcacactcttcctgtt, antisense primer: 5'-accaccgaggagaagatcca, 5'-fam probe: 5-ctacagtgccaccgtcacc. for the taqman gene expression assay  ref. hs00941525_g <dig> was used. for cyclophilin a , used as a reference, the taqman gene expression assay, ref. hs99999904_m <dig> was used. all steps were performed following the recommendations of the manufacturer. relative expression levels of each gene were calculated as previously described.

transfections
cells were grown in 4-well plates to a density of  <dig>   <dig> cells/ml. when the cells reached 50-60% confluence, they were transfected with stat3-decoy odn or the hairpin control decoy odn  in  <dig> μl of dmem medium  combined with the liposomes . after  <dig> h at 37°c in a humidified 5% co <dig> incubator, the cells were placed in fresh serum-containing medium. expression was analyzed after  <dig> h. in other cases, transfection was performed using polyethyleneimine , with an odn-to-polyethyleneimine ratio of 1: <dig> 

flow cytometry, cell viability, immunocytochemistry
to measure cell death, cells were resuspended in annexin v-binding buffer, incubated with  <dig> μl of propidium iodide  and subjected to flow cytometry analysis, using a bd facs canto ii flow cytometer. cell viability was also assessed using the trypan-blue exclusion method with a v-cell counter .

for immunocytochemistry, cells were grown in 8-well plates  to a density of  <dig>   <dig> cells/ml. at 50-60% confluence, cells were transfected with the fitc-labeled stat3-decoy odn or the fitc-labeled mutated stat3-decoy odn. after  <dig> h the cells were washed in nacl-phosphate buffer, fixed in  <dig> % formaldehyde for  <dig> mn, permeabilized in  <dig> % triton x- <dig> for  <dig> mn and blocked in 5% fcs,  <dig> % tween in nacl-phosphate buffer for  <dig> h. cells were stained with anti-stat <dig> antibody   or anti- phosphotyrosine 705-stat <dig> antibody   for  <dig> h and alexa fluor 546-labeled secondary antibody   for  <dig> mn. after counterstaining with 4', 6'- diamidino-2-phenylindole  coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with vectashield . fluorescence images were acquired using a zeiss axioplan <dig> deconvolution microscope  and analyzed with metafer <dig> .

oligodeoxynucleotide pull-down
nuclear protein extracts were obtained as follows:  <dig> million cells were resuspended in lysis buffer  at 4°c for  <dig> min. the lysates were centrifuged at  <dig>  <dig> × g for  <dig> min at 4°c, and the supernatants containing the cytoplasmic proteins were discarded. the pellets were resuspended in the cell lysis buffer adjusted with 20% glycerol and  <dig>  m nacl for  <dig> min at 4°c. after centrifugation at  <dig>  <dig> × g for  <dig> min at 4°c, the supernatants were stored at -80°c. for pull-down assays, 100- <dig> μg of nuclear protein extracts were incubated for  <dig> min at 4°c in binding buffer  containing salmon sperm dna  and  <dig> μg of the biotinylated hairpin decoy odn or the mutated decoy odn. the complexes were captured by incubation with  <dig> μl of avidin-sepharose beads  for  <dig> h at 4°c. for in-cell decoy odn pull-down assays, the cells were first transfected with stat3-decoy odn or its mutated equivalent, as described under oligonucleotide transfection , and then processed as above by cell lysis and recovery on avidin-sepharose beads. after extensive washing with binding buffer, complexes were separated on sds-polyacrylamide  gel, and subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-stat <dig> antibody . results were analyzed by chemiluminescence  and autoradiography .

antibody co-immunoprecipitation
for antibody pull-down assays,  <dig> million cells were lyzed and resuspended in lysis buffer  at 4°c for  <dig> min. the lysates were centrifuged at  <dig>  <dig> × g for  <dig> min at 4°c, and the supernatants containing the cytoplasmic proteins were either used immediately or stored at -80°c. for the immunoprecipitations,  <dig> to  <dig> μg protein was supplemented with albumin-saturated protein g-agarose ; after centrifugation , the pellet was discarded and the supernatant conserved. antibody was added  and incubation continued overnight at 4°c. samples were then supplemented with albumin-saturated protein g-agarose and incubated for  <dig> h  <dig> m. the agarose beads were washed three times with tbs and once with tbs-t, and resuspended in sds-sample buffer. gel separation and western blotting were performed as described above.

RESULTS
survival of sw  <dig> colon carcinoma cells requires activated stat3
stat <dig> is activated in colon carcinoma and in the colon carcinoma cell line sw  <dig>  <cit> . in sw  <dig> cells transfected with specific stat <dig> sirna, the expression of stat <dig> was strongly reduced  and the number of annexin v-positive cells was significantly increased in comparison to cells treated with control sirna . stat <dig> tyrosine  <dig> phosphorylation was detected  as previously reported  <cit> . pull-downs with biotinylated odn were performed, followed by western blotting with anti-stat <dig> antibody. this method is analogous to gel retardation assays, and revealed that stat <dig> is activated. odn-bound activated stat <dig> was detected in nuclear extracts from untreated  and il-6-treated cells ; cytoplasmic stat <dig> only weakly bound the biotinylated odn . treatment of cells with the stat <dig> inhibitor stattic , known to inhibit stat <dig> phosphorylation and dimerization  <cit> , inhibited the nuclear translocation of stat <dig> in sw  <dig> cells , as previously shown in other cell lines  <cit> ; this correlated with induction of cell death .

cytoplasmic sequestration of stat <dig> and phospho-stat <dig> by stat3-decoy odn
the subcellular distribution of stat3-decoy odn in sw  <dig> cells was shown by fluorescence microscopy to be essentially cytoplasmic . immunofluorescence microscopy analyzis of the subcellular localization of phospho-stat <dig> in untreated sw <dig> cells showed that it was essentially nuclear , but following stat3-decoy odn treatment it became mostly cytoplasmic , this was not observed when using mutated stat3-decoy odn . pull-down experiments within cells transfected with biotinylated stat3-decoy odn followed by western blotting showed that phospho-stat <dig> interacted with stat3-decoy odn . in these experiments, the binding of phospho-stat <dig> to the stat3-decoy odn was blocked by the treatment of cells with stattic , known to prevent stat <dig> dimer formation  <cit> , indicating that the stat3-decoy odn binds activated stat <dig> dimers . total stat <dig> was almost exclusively nuclear in untreated cells , but after treatment with stat3-decoy odn it became cytoplasmic . this was not observed when using mutated stat3-decoy odn  but was observed when treating cells with stattic . subcellular localization of stat <dig> studied by cell fractionnation and western blotting showed that stat3-decoy odn efficiently prevented stat <dig> nuclear translocation , whereas neither a mutated stat3-decoy odn , nor a nf-κb-decoy odn did so . a diagram of the data collected from several experiments illustrates the effect of stat3-decoy odn on the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of stat3: in stat3-decoy odn-transfected cells nuclear stat <dig> consisted of 20% of the total stat <dig> ; conversely, in control-, mutated decoy odn-, and nf-κb-decoy odn-transfected cells, it consisted of 50% of the total stat <dig>  suggesting that stat3-decoy odn functions by trapping stat <dig> within the cytoplasm. finally, the binding of stat <dig> to biotinylated stat3-decoy odn within cells was blocked by addition of excess non-biotinylated stat3-decoy odn .

cytoplasmic sequestration of stat <dig> and phospho-stat <dig> by stat3-decoy odn correlates with stat <dig> inhibition and cell death
in stat3-decoy odn-transfected sw  <dig> cells, cell death increased , as previously shown in these  <cit>  and other cells  <cit> . stat3-decoy odn also induced cell death of mcf- <dig> cells, in which a low but detectable stat <dig> activation has been previously observed  <cit> . however, the stat3-decoy odn had no effect on the acute myeloid leukemia cell line kg <dig>  in which stat <dig>  rather than stat <dig>  is activated  <cit>  . the mutated stat3-decoy odn had no effect in any of the three cell lines . the stat3-target cyclin-d <dig> was analyzed by qpcr in stat3-decoy odn-transfected sw  <dig> cells: reduced cyclin-d <dig> expression was observed, similar to that observed with stattic . this suggests that it is the cytoplasmic trapping of stat <dig> by the stat3-decoy odn which leads to cell death. since stat3-decoy odn can also bind stat <dig> and prevent stat1-dependent ifnγ-induced cell death  <cit> , experiments were performed to determine the overall involvement of stat <dig> in stat3-decoy odn-induced cell death. to this end, stat <dig> was silenced using shrna in the sw  <dig> cells. as previously described in other cell systems  <cit> , the expression of stat <dig> was suppressed by specific shrna, and not by empty vector; nf-κb and stat <dig> expression was unchanged . in stat1-silenced sw  <dig> cells, the basal level of dead cells was unchanged. however, stat3-decoy odn-induced cell death was suppressed . there was no effect of the mutated stat3-decoy odn, but ifnγ-induced cell death was suppressed . thus, stat <dig> expression is important for cell death induction by stat <dig> inhibitors, in agreement with observations published elsewhere  <cit> , and in line with the notion that stat <dig> is a key component of the cellular mechanism leading to cell death  <cit> .

blockage of stat <dig> nuclear transfer by stat3-decoy odn is overcome by il-6-mediated activation of stat <dig> or increased expression of recombinant stat3
to evaluate the relevance of stat3-decoy odn/stat <dig> interaction in the reduction of nuclear stat <dig>  cells were transfected with stat3-decoy odn and treated with il- <dig>  and nuclear stat <dig> was analyzed. treatment with il- <dig> significantly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of stat3; inhibition of stat <dig> nuclear transfer by stat3-decoy odn was partially overcome by this treatment , suggesting a titrating effect of the increased amount of active stat <dig> on stat3-decoy odn action. similarly, overexpression of stat <dig> by plasmid transfection of sw  <dig> cells resulted in a marked increase of stat <dig> nuclear localization  and considerably reduced inhibitory effects of stat3-decoy odn  and stattic . however, when more stat3-decoy odn  was added to stat3-overexpressing cells, a reduction of nuclear stat <dig> was observed . conversely, in cells transfected with dbd-mutated stat <dig>  there was no change in nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution after treatment with stat3-decoy odn . this emphasizes the notion that a functional dbd is necessary for stat3-decoy odn to prevent stat <dig> nuclear localization. cell death was also analyzed to determine whether modifications of stat3's subcellular localization affected cell fate. overexpression of stat <dig> in sw  <dig> cells significantly reduced the rate of cell death induced by stat3-decoy odn or by stattic  . combining the cell death data shown in figure 6e with the amounts of nuclear stat <dig> of figure 6b showed that nuclear accumulation of stat <dig> is inversely proportional to cell death . overall, these experiments suggest that stat3-decoy odn-induced cell death results from the inhibition of stat <dig> through its entrapment within the cytoplasm.

stat3-decoy odn interferes with the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of stat3
nuclear transfer of activated stat <dig> through nuclear pores is dependent on nuclear import involving karyopherin/importins, which interact with stat3's nls; the nls located within the dbd being the most efficient in stat <dig>  <cit> . the activated stat <dig> dimer enters the nucleus, binds its dna targets, and is then released, after which it is dephosphorylated by a nuclear tyrosine phosphatase  <cit> ; inhibition of the phosphatase with vanadate traps stat <dig> in the nucleus . the transfer of stat <dig> to the cytoplasm depends in part on the export protein crm <dig>  <cit> , which can be selectively inhibited by leptomycine b   <cit> . to further characterize the mechanism of action of stat3-decoy odn on stat <dig> nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, the cells were treated with lmb or vanadate. treatment with lmb  increased nuclear stat <dig> , as previously shown in v-src expressing cells  <cit>  . treatment with vanadate  or with both lmb and vanadate also increased nuclear stat <dig> . vanadate  and lmb  competed with stat3-decoy odn and opposed its action by retaining stat <dig> within the nucleus.

nuclear transfer of activated stat <dig> involves karyopherins/importins which interact with the nls located within the dbd  <cit> . to verify the possibility of a competition between karyopherin and stat3-decoy odn for stat <dig> binding, stat <dig> immunoprecipitation and stat3-decoy odn pull-downs were compared to one another for their karyopherin content. karyopherin was detected in the stat <dig> immunoprecipitates  and stat <dig> was detected in the karyopherin immunoprecipitates , but neither of them was detected in the igg immunoprecipitate control . on the other hand, stat3-decoy odn-trapped stat <dig>  detected by treating cells with biotinylated stat3-decoy odn , collected on avidin-coated agarose beads and analyzed by western blotting, contained either no karyopherin or only trace amounts, while clearly containing stat <dig> , as previously shown  <cit> . an identical experiment performed with mutated stat3-decoy odn showed practically no detectable stat <dig> or karyopherin . the amount of karyopherin detected in the crude lysates is shown in figures 8a , and 8b . the observations reported here suggest that stat3-decoy odn impairs the binding of stat <dig> complexes to karyopherin.

inhibition of stat <dig> with stat3-decoy odn in sw  <dig> cells is associated with inhibition of nf-κb
experiments were conducted to determine whether the inhibition of stat <dig> by stat3-decoy odn could indirectly affect nf-κb nuclear translocation, since a functional interaction between stat <dig> and nf-κb has been reported in several cellular systems  <cit> . in the sw  <dig> cells, stattic was found to inhibit the nuclear transfer of both stat <dig> and nf-κb , and to inhibit nf-κb activity as measured with a nf-κb-specific reporter plasmid . stat3-decoy odn, but not mutated decoy odn, markedly reduced nf-κb nuclear translocation . pull-down experiments with stat3-decoy odn also showed higher amounts of nf-κb in the complex obtained from the nuclear fraction of il-6-treated cells . tnf-α-stimulated nuclear transfer of nf-κb , which was inhibited by the nf-κb-decoy odn , was insensitive to stat3-decoy odn ; similar results were observed when probing the nf-κb pull-downs with anti-p <dig> antibody, except that the basal levels were somewhat higher . the expression of the direct nf-κb target i-κb, as determined by qpcr analysis, was inhibited to 50% of the control level by stat3-decoy odn . however, tnf-α-induced i-κb mrna remained high in the presence of stat3-decoy odn . on the other hand, the expression of cyclin d <dig>  a stat <dig> target gene, was inhibited by stat3-decoy odn . thus, a decoy odn targeting stat <dig> can inhibit nf-κb indirectly.

discussion
constitutive stat <dig> activation is frequently involved in uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation and therefore constitutes a valuable target for anti-tumor therapy  <cit> . decoy oligonucleotides  have been shown to efficiently induce cell death in many different cellular systems  and to have a potential for specific targeting of tumor cells. however, although it is generally assumed that decoy odns must enter the nucleus to exert their inhibitory action on the targeted tf, little is known of their mechanism of action. to study this issue, the sw  <dig> colon carcinoma tumor cell line was used as a model system. these cells require a basal level of activated stat <dig> for survival  <cit> , as confirmed here by stat3-specific sirna- or stattic-induced cell death. to analyze the impact of a stat3-decoy odn on the subcellular localization of stat <dig> in the colon carcinoma cell line sw  <dig>  a combination of subcellular fractionation, oligonucleotide pull-down and immunofluorescence microscopy was used, in non-stimulated cells in most experiments in order to reproduce physiological conditions as much as possible. the main observations of this study are that: i, the stat3-decoy odn interacts with active phospho-stat <dig> dimers, ii, this interaction results in the cytoplasmic trapping of phospho-stat <dig> and iii, blocked nuclear transfer of active stat <dig> by stat3-decoy odn results in reduced cyclin d <dig>  expression and cell death induction. stat3-decoy odn was found to interact with activated dimeric stat <dig> but not with non-activated stat <dig> . the specificity of stat <dig> targeting by stat3-decoy odn was further evidenced by the absence of any effect on stat <dig> nuclear transfer of either a control mutated stat3-decoy odn or a decoy nf-κb-odn. in addition, stat3-decoy odn did not prevent the nuclear transfer of dna binding domain -mutated stat <dig>  indicating that a functional dbd domain is necessary for activated stat <dig> to bind stat3-decoy odn. nuclear entry of proteins involves a nls within the protein's sequence, which allows interaction with components of the nuclear membrane pore complex . about half of the identified nls lie within the dbd of proteins. stat <dig> contains several nls  <cit> , but its major functional nls lies within the dbd  <cit> ; this dimer-specific nls appears to be essential for stat dimer binding to karyopherin/importins  <cit>  which mediate interaction with the npc. this suggests that stat <dig> cytoplasmic trapping by stat3-decoy odn results from the interaction of the decoy odn with the dbd domain of a functional stat <dig> dimer, thereby masking the nls and preventing interaction with karyopherin/importins as depicted in figure 10a. indeed, stat <dig> immunoprecipitation brought down karyopherin α, while stat3-decoy odn pull-down did not. this observation is in agreement with studies showing that an odn containing the m <dig> sequence can displace the interaction of recombinant phospho-stat <dig> with recombinant importin α  <cit> . the observation that stat3-decoy odn inhibited only activated stat <dig> suggests that it could effectively inhibit stat <dig> in cells in which there is basal nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of activated stat <dig>  constitutive nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of stat <dig> has been observed in several cell systems  <cit> , including v-src transformed cells in which stat <dig> is activated  <cit> . previous immuno-cytochemistry studies have shown that the crm- <dig> inhibitor lmb interferes with the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of stat <dig>  resulting in its nuclear accumulation  <cit>  and inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation  <cit> . in the present study, lmb increased nuclear localization of stat <dig> and prevented the action of stat3-decoy odn, reinforcing the view that the latter acts on nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. similar results were obtained with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate, which increased the amount of nuclear stat <dig>  and also prevented the action of stat3-decoy odn, thereby preventing cytoplasmic retention of stat <dig>  the modification of total stat <dig> subcellular distribution induced by stat3-decoy odn observed here suggests that stat3-decoy odn functions by targeting the nucleo-cytoplasmic traffic itself, as previously suggested  <cit> . the data also indicate that stat3-decoy odn impairs the shuttling of active stat <dig> dimers only, without interfering with the previously reported constitutive activation-independent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of non-phosphorylated dimers  <cit>  . non-phosphorylated stat <dig> was found to be transcriptionally active  <cit> , but whether it can bind stat <dig> consensus sequences is not clear  <cit> . thus, in all likelihood, the inhibitory action of stat3-decoy odn relies on the constitutive activation of stat <dig> in sw  <dig> cells leading to its nuclear localization. the specific inhibition of the nucleo-cytoplasmic turn-over of stat <dig> distinguishes stat3-decoy odn from chemicals, such as stattic  <cit> , that have been designed to prevent stat <dig> dimer formation by interacting with the sh <dig> domain, subsequently impairing nuclear translocation; and from sirnas, which target the entire stat <dig> protein pool in any cell, disrupting functions that may be unrelated to growth and increasing the chances of side effects.

cell death and apoptosis depend partly on stat1-dependent effector genes  <cit>  . in the present study, the suppression of stat <dig> by rna silencing prevented cell death induction by stat3-decoy odn, indicating a critical role for stat <dig>  independent of ifnγ activation, in line with previous observations showing stat1-dependent ifn-independent cell death  <cit> ; . however, stat <dig> is the major effector of ifnγ, which is antiproliferative or tumoricidal in several cancer cell types  <cit> ; although stat3-decoy odn has been found to induce tumor cell death in several different cell systems  <cit> , it can also inhibit stat <dig>  <cit> . despite their opposing biological effects  <cit> , stat <dig> and stat <dig> form heterodimers whose function is unclear  <cit> . thus, despite its efficiency in inducing cell death, and although it has been found to have few side effects when administered to primates  <cit> , suggesting a potential for clinical applications, stat3-decoy odn must be optimized so that it can distinguish between stat <dig> and stat <dig>  work is in progress to try and define the structural constraints that underlie specific recognition of stat3-decoy odn by stat <dig> 

in cancer, stat <dig> and nf-κb have been shown to cooperate in promoting cell growth by interacting at different levels of their activating pathways  <cit> . stat <dig> can trap constitutively activated nf-κb within the nucleus of tumor cells  <cit> . in sw  <dig> cells, both nf-κb and stat <dig> are activated, suggesting a constitutive interleukin secretory loop, as described for several tumor cell systems . the findings of the present paper indicate that active stat <dig> interacts with nf-κb in the colon-carcinoma cell line sw  <dig>  as shown by the presence of nf-κb in stat3-decoy odn pull-downs and by reduced nf-κb transcriptional activity. unphosphorylated stat <dig> also interacts with nf-κb, but apparently binds κb sites  <cit> , and may not be recognized by stat3-decoy odn for this reason. thus, by trapping active stat <dig> within the cytoplasm, stat3-decoy odn can simultaneously trap the fraction of nf-κb that is associated to active stat3; this may potentially allow the targeting of a subset of genes that is essential for uncontrolled tumor cell growth.

CONCLUSIONS
stat3-decoy odn is an efficient inducer of cell death in the colon-carcinoma cell line sw  <dig>  it is shown here to function by trapping activated stat <dig> within the cytoplasm by binding to the active dimer and preventing binding to karyopherin, which is required for the transfer of active stat <dig> into the nucleus. stat3-decoy odn appears to be capable of specifically targeting active stat <dig>  and not its inactive form. thus, stat3-decoy odn inhibits stat <dig> only in cells where stat <dig> is activated, such as cancer cells, resulting in cell death without harming healthy cells. furthermore, the entrapment of stat3-bound nf-κb adds a new powerful anticancer potential to stat3-decoy odn. these results point to the dna binding domain of stat <dig>  as well as the process through which activated stat <dig> enters the nucleus, as potential sources of active anti-cancer compounds.
