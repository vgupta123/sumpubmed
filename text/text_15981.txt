BACKGROUND
caenorhabditis elegans has long been appreciated as a useful model organism for developmental, molecular, and aging biology. as molecular genetic and genomic approaches have become increasingly available, nematode biologists have also become interested in explaining and predicting natural patterns of phenotypic and genomic evolution. these interests have motivated recent efforts to quantify natural phenotypic variation and molecular population genetic structuring, and to characterize the ecology and natural history of nematode species in order to interpret such findings within robust population and ecological genetic contexts . caenorhabditis briggsae was until recently the closest known relative of c. elegans and has therefore been the subject of many different types of comparative analyses . building upon previous discoveries of mitochondrial dna  variation segregating among natural populations  <cit> , we sought to further develop the c. briggsae system by quantifying the degree to which this mtdna diversity is associated with population-level variation in life-history, physiological, and aging related phenotypes. this work will provide a foundation for generating and testing hypotheses in mitochondrial mutation biology and aging research.

mutations that impair functioning of the mitochondrial electron transport chain  are associated with a variety of human metabolic and age-related disorders  <cit> . a barrier to in-depth studies of the inheritance, population dynamics, and effects of clinically relevant mtdna mutations has been the lack of genetic model systems that adequately represent the features of pathogenic mtdna mutations  <cit> . howe and denver  <cit>  discovered a naturally occurring heteroplasmic mtdna deletion segregating among geographically distinct populations of the soil nematode, caenorhabditis briggsae. the deletion eliminates the 5' end  of the nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  gene, the normal protein product of which is an essential and highly conserved core subunit of mitochondrial etc complex i  <cit> . in humans, several neurodegenerative disorders including parkinson's disease are associated with heteroplasmic nd <dig> mutations  <cit> .

the c. briggsae deletion occurs as a consequence of directly repeated 21bp dna sequence tracts in the nd <dig> gene and in an upstream pseudogene named Ψnd5- <dig> . the observed deletion is expected to strongly and negatively affect nd <dig> protein-coding function as the deleted sequences encode more than  <dig> nd <dig> amino acids,  <dig> of which are conserved in c. elegans, d. melanogaster, and humans. two pcr approaches showed that deletion-containing genomes constitute from  <dig> to ~50% of total within-isolate mitochondrial populations .

based on other studies of etc complex i-deficient genotypes  <cit> , we hypothesized that expression of truncated nd <dig> protein products would be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species  production, reduced fitness, and faster rates of aging. higher rates of nuclear  <cit>  and mitochondrial  <cit>  mutation in c. briggsae relative to c. elegans and a negative correlation between nd <dig> deletion frequency and reproductive output in c. briggsae  <cit>  are consistent with this hypothesis, although it cannot yet be ruled out that nuclear-encoded genes are responsible instead.

with the dual goals of further characterizing global phenotypic variation in c. briggsae and developing a novel model system for mitochondrial mutation dynamics, etc dysfunction, and aging research, we performed a survey of natural variation in fitness, physiological, and aging related phenotypes among c. briggsae isolates containing different proportions of nd5-deletion bearing mtdna genomes. we found significant among-isolate variation in all phenotypes studied, some of which was statistically associated with isolate-specific nd <dig> deletion heteroplasmy level. specifically, c. briggsae isolates containing a high proportion of nd <dig> deletion genomes tended to have reduced reproductive fitness and early-onset physical decline compared to isolates with low or zero deletion levels. however, the same isolates did not differ consistently with respect to lifespan, atp content, or acute oxidative stress resistance. additionally, although the c. briggsae isolate with the highest nd <dig> deletion frequency exhibited the highest levels of ros as expected, we found a non-linear relationship between nd <dig> deletion and ros level. these patterns may be explained by as yet unknown differences in physiological adaptations among c. briggsae isolates; e.g., ros detoxification mechanisms and reliance on anaerobic energy metabolism.

RESULTS
we surveyed variation in life history, physiology, and aging phenotypes among wild c. briggsae isolates that represent the full spectrum of natural variation in nd <dig> deletion frequency . we found strong and significant negative correlations between nd <dig> deletion level and both nematode fecundity and population growth rate  . these patterns are driven entirely by two of the three high-deletion isolates as compared to low and zero-deletion isolates  and may indicate that the nd <dig> deletion has a negative effect on c. briggsae fitness only when its frequency reaches a certain threshold . specifically, when isolates were subdivided into deletion frequency categories , we found that high-nd <dig> deletion isolates had significantly reduced total fecundities and r compared to either low or zero-deletion isolates . we also found a significant negative correlation between nd <dig> deletion level and lifespan , but the pattern is far weaker than that for fecundity. indeed, low-deletion isolates were found to live longer than either high or zero-deletion isolates , a pattern driven by the particularly long lifespan of low-deletion isolate, pb <dig>  .

grand means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for all traits measured. f is the test statistic for one-way analyses of variance for each phenotype in c. briggsae isolates. ρ is the pearson correlation coefficient between isolate-specific trait means and deletion frequencies. *, **, and *** denote significance at the  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  levels, respectively.

consistent with findings from c. elegans , we found little evidence for life history tradeoffs in c. briggsae isolates; average correlations between all pairs of reproduction and longevity traits were positive . however, we found one exception to this trend for isolate-specific trait correlations: the three high-nd <dig> deletion c. briggsae isolates are significantly more likely to experience a tradeoff between early fecundity and longevity; i.e., animals that live long tend to have reduced fecundity early in life  when such a reduction will most negatively affect population growth rates. these findings are reminiscent of those for c. elegans long lived mutants assayed either under nutritional stress  <cit>  or benign conditions  <cit>  and are consistent with the idea that the tradeoffs predicted by life history theory  <cit>  may only manifest themselves in nematodes experiencing some form of stress - either exogenous or endogenous stress .

because pharyngeal pumping rate is a reliable biomarker of age in c. elegans  <cit> , we hypothesized that high-nd <dig> deletion c. briggsae isolates would exhibit slower pharyngeal pumping in non-aging individuals as well as faster declines in pharyngeal pumping  with age when compared to low and zero-nd <dig> deletion isolates. in agreement with the first expectation, we observed a striking negative relationship between nd <dig> deletion level and average pharyngeal pumping rates in non-aging worms . this trend persisted with increasing age; however, high deletion strains exhibited a somewhat slower rate of decline in pharyngeal pumping rates compared to low and zero-deletion isolates . this may mean that high deletion isolates experience late-life reductions in their rates of aging compared to other isolates. finally, we found significant natural variation in adult pharyngeal pumping rates throughout early but not late life . the magnitude of among-isolate differences in pumping rates was greatest during the young adult stage  and declined slightly over the lifespan of the worms. interestingly, the sharp decline in mean pumping rates at  <dig> days post-l <dig> coincided with the end of the reproductive period; this pattern is not observed in the congener, c. elegans .

to further quantify natural phenotypic variation and to test whether the observed relationships between fitness-related life history traits and nd <dig> deletion levels may be mediated by mitochondrial etc functioning, we quantified the relationship between nd <dig> deletion level and several aspects of animal physiology. our expectation was that, as a result of reduced mitochondrial etc efficiency, higher-nd <dig> deletion isolates would exhibit reduced levels of atp and oxidative stress resistance, together with increased ros production compared to lower or zero-nd <dig> deletion isolates.

only some of the above expectations were borne out by the data. we found significant among-isolate variation in average atp content of young adult animals; however, there was only a weak, nonsignificant negative relationship between atp content and nd <dig> deletion frequency . if high-nd <dig> deletion isolate, vt <dig> , which produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm atp/mg protein, was removed from the analysis, the correlation became more strongly negative . atp production is known from other studies to sometimes be robust to etc dysfunction; however, these data highlight the need to understand the degree to which nematodes may rely on alternate energy production pathways  <cit> , which could obfuscate any pattern between atp level and nd <dig> deletion frequency, for example.

we found significant among-isolate variation for oxidative stress resistance as measured by survival times of worms during acute paraquat exposure . we predicted that, if higher-nd <dig> deletion isolates experience mitochondrial dysfunction leading to increased endogenous ros levels, these isolates would be less able to survive attack from exogenous sources of ros. a weak but significant negative relationship existed between this form of oxidative stress resistance and nd <dig> deletion frequency . this pattern was largely driven by two low-nd <dig> deletion isolates  with high oxidative stress resistance . we currently have no information on whether c. briggsae isolates vary in their expression of antioxidant proteins and thus in their abilities to detoxify ros, which would provide one possible explanation for the weak relationship between paraquat-induced oxidative stress resistance and nd <dig> deletion heteroplasmy level.

finally, relative ros levels measured for pharyngeal bulbs also varied significantly among c. briggsae isolates . we measured total levels of mitochondrial oxidants using mitosox red . mitosox red is preferentially taken up by actively respiring mitochondria, and while it is nearly exclusively oxidized by superoxide  <cit> --the most common form of mitochondrially generated ros--it is considered an accurate and effective system for measuring total ros levels in vivo  <cit> . in contrast to our simple expectation that a positive, linear relationship would exist between nd <dig> deletion frequency and ros level, we found a significant, non-linear relationship between these variables such that zero and high deletion isolates tended to exhibit higher superoxide levels than low deletion isolates . the in vivo fluorogenic dye-based method used here gives a view of net ros level in living tissue and therefore reflects both the rate at which ros are generated by cells and the rate at which they are scavenged by superoxide dismutases and other antioxidant systems. consequently, we do not yet know which of these sources of variability explain more of the variance in net ros levels among isolates, which was considerable despite modest sample sizes . this variation suggests that c. briggsae may provide a useful system in which to test whether endogenous ros have a role in generating variability in spontaneous mutation rates  <cit> .

thus, while more work is required to understand whether and how the nd <dig> deletion directly affects mitochondrial functioning in c. briggsae, it is clear that there is no simple relationship between isolate-specific net ros production and the detrimental phenotypes associated with high nd <dig> deletion heteroplasmy levels in nature. for example, both japanese isolates, hk <dig> and hk <dig>  exhibit low fitness  and pharyngeal pumping rates , but their relative levels of superoxide  are quite different from one another . these results may indicate that c. briggsae isolates experience different forms of mitochondrial dysfunction  that may or may not be related directly to the nd <dig> deletion.

the limited molecular population genetic structuring of c. briggsae  belies the striking phenotypic variation among isolates reported here, the latter of which suggests an immense capacity for evolution of aging and life-history phenotypes. together with previous findings of geographic variation in mitochondrial genome content among c. briggsae isolates  <cit>  and of elevated spontaneous mutation rates in some isolates relative to the c. elegans n <dig> lab strain  <cit> , the findings from this paper suggest that c. briggsae will provide an opportunity to understand the linkages between mitochondrial function , mutation processes, and aging. and importantly, because c. briggsae contains naturally-occurring mtdna variation that is likely to affect organismal fitness, this system offers a major advantage for studying the evolutionary dynamics of mtdna mutations over c. elegans where the majority of mtdna mutant strains have been isolated from laboratory mutagenesis screens.

CONCLUSIONS
although we found no straightforward relationship between nd <dig> deletion frequency and relative ros levels, our accumulated findings are consistent with the notion that the natural mitochondrial genetic variation observed among c. briggsae isolates is detrimental to the organism. this is particularly true in light of recent studies that show high mutation rates in high-nd <dig> c. briggsae isolates  <cit> , nevertheless, two issues prevent us from demonstrating that the nd <dig> deletion is the root cause of the detrimental phenotypes: 1) nd <dig> deletion level is clearly confounded with phylogenetic relationship , and 2) we cannot disentangle the effects of among-isolate variation in nd <dig> deletion level from among-isolate nuclear variation on the phenotypes studied here. however, the ability to generate inbred lines and mitochondrial-nuclear hybrid strains in which mitochondria from natural c. briggsae isolates with different nd <dig> deletion heteroplasmy levels may be evaluated on uniform nuclear genetic backgrounds  <cit>  will be a major advantage of this nematode system.  a congener of the well-known model nematode, c. elegans, c. briggsae has a similar life-history and mating system, and offers many of the same advantages as c. elegans as an animal genetic model system  <cit> . together with the ample among-isolate variation in nd <dig> deletion heteroplasmy level   <cit>  and aging-related phenotypes, we contend that the c. briggsae system offers a powerful and versatile model for understanding the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and aging in an evolutionary context, as well as the basic biology underlying mtdna deletion genetics. this study lays the necessary groundwork to rigorously test these and other questions in aging biology and life history theory .
