BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a very versatile bacterial organism that has a unique capability to thrive and survive in a great variety of habitats. the bacterium is ubiquitously found in aquatic and terrestic environments and has evolved as an important opportunistic pathogen that causes serious infections in plants, insects and vertebrates  <cit> . in the human host p. aeruginosa is mainly a nosocomial pathogen feared for entailing acute pneumonia and sepsis accompanied with very high mortality rates  <cit> . moreover, p. aeruginosa is a dominant bacterial pathogen that causes chronic infections in patients with burns or suffering from cystic fibrosis   <cit> . most of the cf patients acquire p. aeruginosa from the environment during their early life-time  <cit>  and develop a chronic p. aeruginosa lung infection which largely determines the fate and prognosis in these patients. a very characteristic finding is that the same bacterial lineage usually persists for years or even decades in the chronically infected cf lung and cannot be eradicated even by intensified anti-pseudomonas therapy  <cit> . thus, in order to overcome chronic persistent disease, novel anti-microbial treatment strategies are desperately needed. for that purpose, it seems to be essential to gain detailed insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie bacterial adaptation processes to the environment of the cystic fibrosis lung, which results in the evolution of a protected and persistent bacterial population. recently smith at al.  <cit>  have conducted a very powerful approach to gain global information on p. aeruginosa adaptation to the chronically infected cf lung. they performed whole genome sequencing of an early and a late p. aeruginosa cf isolate and could show that many single-base changes accumulated in the late isolate that were obviously advantageous for the life within the host. intriguingly, these mutations caused loss of functions used by bacteria to invade and injure the host, indicating that they may become a burden once the chronic infection has become established. the work by smith et al.  <cit>  has opened a window to complex questions of bacterial adaptation and evolution during chronic infections. the great challenge now is to expand the search for adaptive mutations and to validate the findings. furthermore a more detailed analysis whether evolution produces one adapted strain or whether it produces a diverse community of infecting bacteria is desirable.

in this study we have designed a p. aeruginosa affymetrix custom made "tiling" array  composed of approximately  <dig>  25-mer oligonucleotides that – due to the large chromosome – depicts approximately 85% of the pao <dig> genome. to our knowledge, pata <dig> is the first tiling array targeting a complete pseudomonas genome. the probes of a tiling array are more or less equally distributed across the genome instead of using a small subset of probes targeting e.g. orfs like the affymetrix pao <dig> genechip® or other available dna microarrays. therefore, tiling arrays produce unbiased data on the whole chromosome. the method has been successfully applied to detect mutations in helicobacter pylori  <cit> . we evaluated whether with a microarray-hybridisation based method this array is capable of identifying genome variations in p. aeruginosa as a cost-effective alterative to whole genome sequencing. by comparative hybridization of chromosomal dna of a pao <dig> and a pa <dig> strain, we clearly demonstrate that our custom made pata <dig> array efficiently detects inter-strain genetic variations even at the level of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and can be used as a highly sophisticated tool for the identification of the p. aeruginosa genome organization.

methods
organism & culturing
the p. aeruginosa strains used for the microarray experiments presented in this study were pao <dig>  and pa <dig> . p. aeruginosa dsm <dig> was used as a reference strain to test for the presence of the pa <dig> deletion. cultures were grown in brain-heart infusion  medium at 37°c in shaking glass flasks or tubes at  <dig> rpm.

dna preparation and microarray hybridization
cell samples were harvested from  <dig> ml of  <dig> h stationary phase liquid cultures. genomic dna was isolated using the dneasy blood & tissue kit . cell lysates were treated with rnase i  to prevent accidental carryover of rna to the microarray. genomic dna was partially digested with dnase i  to a fragment size of ~ <dig> –  <dig> bp, confirmed by gel electrophoresis, and fragments were labeled at the 3'-ends with biotin-ddutp  using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase .

for each sample  <dig> –  <dig> μg of labeled dna fragments were hybridized to an identical lot of pata <dig> array for  <dig> hours at 50°c.

after hybridization the genechips were washed, stained with sa-pe and read using an affymetrix genechip fluidic station and scanner according to affymetrix standard protocols .

validation of a  <dig> kb deletion at pa <dig> by pcr
two sets of primers were designed to test genomic dna for presence of the  <dig> kb deletion identified from microarray data. primers a <dig>  and a <dig>  are placed outside the suspected region while b <dig>  and b <dig>  span a sequence inside this region. dna polymerase gotaq  was used for pcr.

analysis of tiling array data
analysis of microarray data was performed using the affymetrix gcos  <dig>  to generate the raw data files .

the raw data files were further analyzed using 'tiling analysis software'  version  <dig>  by affymetrix. for probe analysis a bandwidth of  <dig>  was applied. the signal ratio for an oligonucleotide i is expressed as di = log <dig>  the log <dig> scaled quotient di of probe signal st,i of the treatment group and probe signal sc,i of the control group of arrays.

integrated genome browser  was used for visualization of signal ratios.

for facilitating array analysis a flexible java program was developed. hereby, result text files containing probe signal and p values for the corresponding oligonucleotides are imported and mapped onto known genes and intergenic regions of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  analysis results are stored in tab-separated files including significantly detected genes. beside obtaining gene information from an implemented file, a variable index file can be constructed from an appropriate file presented by the user. this java program was tested on jre  <dig> . <dig> and is provided for download .

RESULTS
design of a whole genome tiling array for pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1
the p. aeruginosa tiling array pata <dig> was designed in cooperation with and manufactured by affymetrix according to genechip® custom express™ array design guide . this tiling array was originally developed to screen uncharacterized p. aeruginosa strains for genetic differences. the genome sequence of strain pao <dig> available from the pseudomonas genome database  was used as template for designing perfect match  tiling probes with a density of  <dig> bp . the standard practice for probe selection is to prune against specific bacterial and species-specific controls. pruning is a sequence comparison method and increases the quality of the unique probe selected for the design and reduces the risk of cross-hybridization with other sequences . sequences used for hard pruning are generally highly repetitive elements, such as alu-like elements, or abundantly expressed rna, like rrna. probes that cross-hybridize to hard pruning sequences were excluded. this resulted in a total of  <dig> probes with  <dig> base pair length . thus,  <dig> % of the whole genome sequence  is present on pata <dig> with an average tiling of ~ <dig> bases, hence leaving gaps of  <dig> bases average length . for two gap regions  selected probes were removed as a result of hard pruning with  <dig> sequences – 16s rrna and 23s rrna . a second round of probe selection was started including only these gap regions and having gaps greater than  <dig> bp to maximize the coverage of the tiling array while minimizing unspecific hybridization effects. by this we increased the number of probes with  <dig> additional probes. as negative controls we used  <dig> affymetrix arabidopsis tiling probes as an estimate of background activity.

in silico comparison of pao <dig> array probes with the pa <dig> genome sequence
in order to estimate how many genetic differences between the two fully sequenced p. aeruginosa strains pao <dig> and pa <dig> can theoretically be detected with the array we first identified in an in silico approach the best matching sequence of the published pa <dig> genome for each  <dig> bp oligonucleotide present on the array. perfect matches  of oligonucleotides with the pa <dig> sequence were identified in an initial run using ncbi's blast software  <cit> . the blast search was sufficient for the detection of identical sequences. however, since blast uses a heuristic approach that approximates the smith-waterman algorithm  <cit>  the alignment is fast but less accurate in finding optimal matches of non-identical sequences. therefore all oligonucleotides for which blast found no perfect match were aligned in a second run using 'jaligner'  <cit> . jaligner is a freely available java tool that makes use of the original smith-waterman algorithm. this algorithm is very slow  but always finds the single optimum alignment. combining the results from both alignments, we could determine the position of the best matching sequence within the pa <dig> genome, the sequence similarity, i.e. the fraction of nucleotides that is identical in both sequences that are compared, and furthermore the exact positions of mismatches and gaps. additional to the best matching sequence, blast  identified other less than optimal sequences. however, these secondary alignment hits were of much lower quality  and were therefore not considered for further analysis.

the sequence alignment results were subsequently used to classify the oligonucleotides according to sequence similarity .  <dig>  of all oligonucleotides were found to be identical in sequence to their best matching pa <dig> sequence ;  <dig>  showed a single nucleotide polymorphism ;  <dig>  showed more than a single mismatch but still had at least 80% identical nucleotides with not more than  <dig> gaps ; and  <dig>  had a similarity below this threshold and were therefore classified as low matching or 'absent'. it should be noted that, due to the algorithm that was applied, even absent sequences will always result in some match with low similarity that can usually be considered as random.

the core genomes of pa <dig> and pao <dig> show a high synteny  with the exception of a large genomic inversion between two of the four ribosomal gene clusters  <cit> . this inversion is also reflected in the alignment data of the pata <dig> oligonucleotides and the pa <dig> genome: for a major part of the genome the best matching sequences in pa <dig> were found in reversed order and on the opposite strand. the best matches of 'absent' oligonucleotides where distributed over the whole genome of pa <dig>  which indicates that these hits are most probably random hits.

in figure 3a we depicted a 'chromosomal map' of the pao <dig> chromosome displayed as horizontal bands each one representing a region  of  <dig> kb length. regions of low sequence similarity in comparison to the pa <dig> genome, i.e. regions specific to pao <dig>  appear as darker bands  in the maps, whereas regions of high average sequence similarity are white. we furthermore compared this chromosomal map with that generated on the basis of a previously published work  <cit>  where the authors identified  <dig> pao <dig> specific regions that were larger than  <dig> bp by an orf by orf alignment of the pao <dig> and pa <dig> sequence . both analyses generate a very similar pattern suggesting that this pattern could function as a unique 'genomic fingerprint' for strain pa <dig>  recently, the genome-wide comparison of five p. aeruginosa strains identified regions showing significant inter-strain variation  <cit> .  <dig> regions of genomic plasticity  containing variations or insertions that are specific to pao <dig> as compared to pa <dig> were identified and all of them are also represented in our genomic fingerprint .

comparative hybridization of the pao <dig> and pa <dig> genomes
to analyze the potential of pata <dig> to detect genetic differences, we comparatively hybridized dna of pao <dig> and pa <dig> on the array. the probe signals  of different oligonucleotides on a single array showed large variation  for both the pa <dig> and the reference pao <dig> dna, presumably due to different binding affinities that depend more or less directly on the oligonucleotide sequence. however, a comparison of two independent pao <dig> arrays demonstrated that the variation within one microarray was reproducible and variation between data for the same probe on different arrays was considerably low . a pair wise comparison of  <dig> independent pao <dig> arrays showed high correlation of corresponding probe signals with an average correlation coefficient of r =  <dig>  . when hybridizing pa <dig> chromosomal dna to the array, we observed a large number of decreased probe signals putatively indicating genetic variations . the signal ratios  revealed the same unique pattern of pao <dig> specific regions, that was already identified in the in silico sequence alignment . again, pao <dig> strain specific regions appeared as darker bands on a bright background of regions with high sequence similarity. the highly reproducible fingerprint like pattern of sequence similarity on the chromosomal scale does not only provide a tool for strain identification, but also allows detailed determination of the genomic structure, e.g. presence and location of genomic islands and strain specific regions.

as opposed to the identification of the presence or absence of strain specific regions, the detection of inter-strain variations at the level of single oligonucleotides is less clear cut. signal ratios of variant and unchanged regions are overlapping as can be observed in the scatter plot of the comparative hybridization of pao <dig> and pa <dig> . therefore, any threshold applied to filter out variant signal ratios will lead to disregard of some variant regions because their signal ratio is not changed enough  and on the other hand detection of unchanged regions that show for some reason a variation to a lowered signal ratio . the quality of the set of oligonucleotides that is detected as variant by applying a certain threshold can be expressed in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the detection. we defined an oligonucleotide i as 'detected' , if its signal ratio di was below dth, the signal ratio threshold . the sensitivity of detection was defined as

  sens=nvar⁡nvar⁡ <dig> 

where dth denotes the signal ratio threshold, nvar the number of oligonucleotides with sequence variations  that showed a signal ratio di ≤ dth , and nvar⁡ <dig> the total number of variant oligonucleotides. thus, sensitivity describes how many oligonucleotides that are different to the pa <dig> sequence actually are detected upon application of a certain dth.

furthermore, we defined specificity as

  spec=nvar⁡ntotal 

where ntotal is the number of all oligonucleotides with di ≤ dth . hence, specificity describes the fraction of correct detections  among all detections.

in order to find a threshold optimizing sensitivity and specificity we determined the number of detected oligonucleotides for a range of dth values based on a data set obtained from comparative hybridization of  <dig> independent arrays for both pa <dig> and pao <dig> . application of a more restrictive, i.e. more negative, dth generally reduced the detection, as reflected by the detection counts  and thus the sensitivity . e.g., more than  <dig> variant oligonucleotides were detected using dth = - <dig> while only ~ <dig> false positives remained . however, this high specificity of ~ <dig>   lead to a drop in sensitivity to  <dig> , meaning 60% true hits were missed in this case. a significantly higher sensitivity of  <dig>  resulted for dth = - <dig>  while specificity was still high . sensitivity further increased with a less restrictive dth but at the cost of a strong decrease in specificity .

remarkably, such high sensitivities could already be achieved by comparative hybridization of only one single array for each pao <dig> and pa <dig>  though the values showed variation when different arrays were compared . including more arrays in an analysis  did not increase the sensitivity. specificity, on the other hand, increased with larger sets of arrays  indicating that the observed variation in sensitivity is caused by falsely positive detection of oligonucleotides, which occurs randomly. when attempting to identify genetic variations in uncharacterized strains, it seems therefore reasonable to use even only one array for both the test and reference strain as a first scan for putative variations. more arrays could then be used to increase specificity as a validation of results, although this could as well be achieved by less sophisticated  methods such as sequencing of a putative variant gene.

a the four analyses of  <dig> ×  <dig> array are the four possible combinations of arrays that were used in the  <dig> ×  <dig> analysis. the  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> analyses contain the above stated microarrays plus additional ones.

detection of variations at the gene level
since the tiling analysis software  provided by affymetrix can process the results of a comparative hybridization only at the level of oligonucleotides and a user usually might be more interested in the genes that are affected by the detected variations, we also developed a java software tool to translate these results to the level of genes. the software reads the output data produced by tas and applies a signal threshold dth to filter out candidate variant oligonucleotides. the oligonucleotide positions are then used to map these detections to the corresponding genes or intergenic regions. as an example, table  <dig> shows the results of both the sequence alignment and a comparative hybridization analyzed with tas and our java tool for the gene clusters containing wbp and related genes that are involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharides . pao <dig> contains two clusters of wbp genes, one of which  is specific to pao <dig>  <cit>  while the other  is present in both pao <dig> and pa <dig>  in case of the specific genes of the pa3141-pa <dig> cluster, most of the oligonucleotides covering those genes belonged to the 'mism' or 'absent' similarity class in the in silico alignment. the comparative hybridization also detected most of the oligonucleotides of the specific genes as absent, which is also reflected by the high sensitivity close to 100%. the other gene cluster showed a high sequence similarity in both strains with a few snps present in each gene . detection of those snps showed sensitivities around  <dig> – 60% corresponding to the global average for snps.

detection of mismatches is affected by mismatch position and the type of nucleotide substitution
the detection of mismatches by comparative hybridization relies on the decreased formation of probe/sample dna duplexes. it has been show previously that the hybridization of dna fragments on surface tethered probes is affected by various factors, such as the position of the mismatch within the duplex and the stacking energy at this position  <cit> , or surface properties of the array  <cit> . in our in silico analysis  <dig> oligonucleotides with single nucleotides polymorphisms  could be identified , enabling a detailed analysis of snp detection from our experimental data. grouping all snp oligonucleotides according to the location of the mismatch demonstrated that mismatches at marginal positions mostly lead to a much smaller decrease of signal ratio as compared to mismatches located at a more central position . the average signal ratio for a mismatch at a central position was about - <dig>  and approached zero at the positions close to either of both ends, which also severely affected the sensitivity . this significant drop in sensitivity can be observed at the  <dig> outermost positions of either side , while sensitivity was relatively similar  for the central  <dig> positions.

to analyze the influence of the type of nucleotide present in the mismatching position we grouped all snps according to the alleles present in the pata <dig> probes and the pa <dig> sequence, respectively. this analysis revealed a marked bias in the median  signal ratios of certain snps . the median signal ratios differed from - <dig>  for snps where a 't' within the probe corresponded with a 'c' within the pa <dig> sequence  down to only - <dig>  for snps with alleles pao1-c/pa14-a. most notably, this effect seemed to be asymmetric, since the median signal ratios for opposite snps, like e.g. pao1-t/pa14-a and pao1-a/pao1-t, showed large differences in most cases .

numbers in brackets indicate the abundance of each snp in our data.

a mismatching nucleotide in the oligonucleotide probe and in the pa <dig> sequence, respectively.

furthermore, grouping the different snps according to the category of the nucleotide substitution revealed that the bias observed in our data strongly depended on the 'interaction type' of the nucleotides present in either allele. the nucleotides g and c can be categorized as showing 'strong interaction'  because they can form three hydrogen bonds in contrast to a and t which show only weak interaction . while any snp constitutes a mispairing and thus no regular h bonds are formed, the median signal ratio was different for different combinations of interaction types  in the probe and sample alleles . the strongest decrease in signal ratio  was observed for snps, where an s nucleotide in the pa <dig> sample dna corresponded to w in the pao <dig> probe . on the other hand, snps with pao1-s/pa14-w showed only a median signal ratio of - <dig> . this asymmetry cannot be explained by the sequence, which is the same except for the mismatch itself, and probably results from the surface fixation of the probe. it has been shown previously that surface effects affect duplex formation  <cit> .

the marked differences in abundance of snp types  result mostly from a biased transition/transversion ratio. according to our data, transitional substitutions, i.e. mutations from purine  to purine or pyrimidine  to pyrimidine, occur about  <dig> times as often as transversions  . however, the signal ratios of transversions and transitions did not show any significant bias.

we also examined the influence on the signal ratio of the nucleotides that are direct neighbors of the mismatch. there are  <dig> possible trinucleotides formed by the snp nucleotide and its direct neighbors and  <dig> different alleles forming a mismatch at the central position with these trinucleotides. the results for each of these  <dig> different combinations is provided in additional file  <dig>  the signal ratio is on average less negative if a snp is flanked by strongly interacting bases  as summarized in table  <dig>  therefore, such snps are more difficult to detect as indicated by the lower sensitivity.

detection of a  <dig> kb deletion in the washington genome center pao <dig> strain
since pa <dig> is closely related to pao <dig> and more than 75% of the pata <dig> oligonucleotides correspond to identical sequences in pa <dig>  the comparative hybridization of pao <dig> and pa <dig> dna should allow not only the detection of variations in pa <dig> as opposed to pao <dig> but also of variations in the chromosomal dna of pao <dig> as opposed to the hypothetical pao <dig> sequence which was used for designing the pata <dig> oligonucleotide probes. in contrast to the above described variations in pa <dig>  those pao <dig> variations should appear as an increase in probe signal. indeed, we identified a whole set of  <dig> oligonucleotides with signal ratios between  <dig>   and  <dig>  , which all together covered parts of the two hypothetical orfs pa <dig> and pa <dig>  since the increased signal ratio resulted from a decrease in the pao <dig> probe signals while pa <dig> probe signals were unaffected, we postulated a partial deletion of these two genes in the washington pao <dig> strain to be the cause of the observation. this hypothesis was tested by pcr amplification of  the whole region including short parts of the flanking sequence  and  a shorter sequence inside the hypothetical deletion . the size of this deletion could be predicted to be between  <dig> –  <dig> bp considering the location to the unaffected oligonucleotide that were closest to that region. the pcr results using pao <dig> and pa <dig> chromosomal dna, respectively, clearly indicated a size shift of the expected band for primer pair a1/a <dig> of ~ <dig> bp which perfectly fits the prediction  and with primers b1/b <dig> no pcr product was observed for pao <dig>  as an alternative to the washington genome center pao <dig> strain that was used for microarray hybridization, we also tested pao <dig> dsm <dig> which like pa <dig> resulted in pcr products corresponding to the published sequence of pa4684/ <dig>  these results clearly indicate a genetic difference between different strains of pao <dig> 

discussion
in this study we have successfully designed and evaluated a tiling microarray which targets the whole chromosome of the facultative pathogen p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  given pao1's large genome size and a limited construction capacity, one microarray depicted the genome with 25-base-long oligonucleotides tiled with an average  <dig> base pair spacing which corresponded to an average gap between the oligonucleotides of  <dig> base pairs.

the alignment of all pao <dig> derived  <dig> base pair sequences present on the p. aeruginosa microarray with the published genome sequence of strain pa <dig> identified regions specific to pao <dig> that largely correspond the results of previous studies based on orf-by-orf alignment  <cit> . experimental data from comparative hybridization of pa <dig> and pao <dig> dna on the pata <dig> chip reproduced this pattern at the chromosomal scale , indicating that genetic differences affecting multiple consecutive oligonucleotides on the array can be detected at very high sensitivity and specificity, even when data were obtained from only one comparative hybridization.

the comparative hybridization of a reference pao <dig> obtained from the washington genome centre and the pa <dig> strain, furthermore lead to the identification of a  <dig> kb deletion in the washington pao <dig> strain, as compared to the published pao <dig> sequence. this deletion affected part of the pa <dig> and almost the whole pa <dig> gene and explains why in the washington transposon mutant collection no insertions within the pa <dig> gene have been found.

whereas genetic differences affecting multiple consecutive oligonucleotides on the array can easily be detected, we were also interested in the performance of the p. aeruginosa genome array in the identification of single-base pair changes. a similar microarray has previously been developed and successfully applied for the identification of even single-point mutations leading to metronidazole resistance in h. pylori strains  <cit> . to evaluate the performance of the pata <dig> array we compared an in silico alignment with experimental comparative hybridization data in great detail and identified three factors influencing the sensitivity in the detection of single nucleotide mismatches: i) positional bias – mismatches located at the  <dig> marginal positions from either side of the oligonucleotide were detected with a much lower sensitivity than mismatches at central locations, leaving a core region of  <dig> nucleotides; ii) interaction sites bias – sensitivity was decreased for mismatches where a c or g  on the pao <dig> probe sequence was corresponding to an a or t  in the pa <dig> sample sequence and vice versa; and iii) neighbor bias – sensitivity was increased if the nucleotides neighboring the mismatch showed weaker binding, i.e. fewer h bonds , and vice versa.

because the sensitivity towards point mutations was significantly reduced at the outer  <dig> positions at either end of an oligonucleotide, the core regions of all oligonucleotides covered only ~58% of the pao <dig> chromosome effectively. this limitation leaves space for a next microarray generation which should depict the whole genome with 25-base-long oligonucleotides tiled with a  <dig> base pair or less spacing . however, despite this low effective coverage, about 50% of all single nucleotide polymorphisms  theoretically covered by the pata <dig> array could be detected in a comparative hybridization of pao <dig> and pa <dig> genomes using a threshold hybridization ratio of dth = - <dig> . variations larger than snps were detected with a much higher sensitivity  leading to an overall detection of about 60% of all theoretical variations with high specificity.

our results clearly indicate that the microarray hybridization presented in this study represents a very robust method to screen whole sets of p. aeruginosa strains bearing unknown genetic variations. one attractive future application of these microarrays could be to identify and depict the p. aeruginosa genome organization of clinical strains. most of the cf patients acquire p. aeruginosa from the environment early in life and suffer from transient airway infections with diverse strains of p. aeruginosa, whereas at a later stage the patients become permanently colonized with one or few p. aeruginosa clones  <cit> . although diverse environmental p. aeruginosa isolates cause chronic infections in the cf lung, it has recently been reported that there are dominant clones in the environment and disease and that individual clones prefer a specific repertoire of accessory segments  <cit> . in contrast to the core genome, which is mostly shared by all p. aeruginosa strains, the accessory genome is highly strain specific  <cit> .

the microarray could be used as a highly sophisticated fingerprinting method to significantly advance the question of whether there are specific genome organizations or certain genetic elements in clinical strains that are more frequently associated with chronic disease and with adverse clinical outcome. these traits may serve as important prognostic markers and may be targets of future drugs designed specifically for action against chronic infections. the recent development of next generation microarrays will offer the opportunity to include strain specific markers  of common p. aeruginosa clones.

furthermore arrays that cover the whole p. aeruginosa genome  might serve as an alternative cost-effective method and a clear alternative to whole genome sequencing strategies for the identification of genetic variations. the availability of an easy to perform mutation discovery method in p. aeruginosa will make a very important contribution and will significantly advance the field of patho-adaptive p. aeruginosa evolution during the chronic infection process. p. aeruginosa undergoes an intense genetic adaptation processes during the establishment of chronic pulmonary infections in the cf lung in which  mutations leading to the loss of function of multiple genes are positively selected  <cit> . this adaptive behavior seems to be crucial in the development of chronic persistent disease, were p. aeruginosa resides in a protected niche within biofilms and hides from the host immune responses. a detailed knowledge on general patho-adaptive mutations will lead to the identification of infection relevant bacterial traits which might be very interesting targets for the development of alternative treatment strategies effective against chronic persistent diseases.

moreover, since the p. aeruginosa microarray presented in this study depicts the whole pao <dig> genome including the intergenic regions, the array could also serve as a valuable tool to identify binding sites of transcriptional regulators via the "chip-on-chip" technique. chip-on-chip , is a genome-wide location analysis and a technique for isolation and identification of the dna sequences occupied by specific dna binding proteins in cells  <cit> . more than 9% of the open reading frames in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> encode for  transcriptional regulators or two-component systems which facilitate efficient adaptation to varied habitats  <cit> . the identification of the transcriptional regulons involved in the regulation of functions required for bacterial persistence could significantly advance knowledge on specific p. aeruginosa adaptation to the environment of the cf lung.

CONCLUSIONS
chronic p. aeruginosa infections remain a major challenge for the medical profession, because even intensified antimicrobial therapy is usually not sufficient to eradicate e.g. persistent infections of the cf lung. thus, novel anti-pseudomonas treatment strategies that target the functions required for bacterial persistence are desperately needed. in this study we have developed a robust microarray-hybridization based method that can be applied i) to identify patho-adaptive mutations that facilitate p. aeruginosa persistence during chronic infection, ii) as a highly sophisticated bacterial fingerprinting method that may help to identify specific clones or genetic elements that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes, and iii) to identify global regulons by the "chip-on-chip" technique that play major roles in the regulation of virulence. these applications should significantly expand our knowledge on bacterial adaptation, evolution and regulatory mechanisms of persistence on a global scale and thus should advance the development of effective antibacterial treatment strategies to overcome persistent disease.
