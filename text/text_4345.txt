BACKGROUND
the primary importance of oral vaccination is that many infections start from the gastrointestinal tract, and in these cases, topical application of a vaccine is usually required to induce a gut mucosal immune response  <cit> . however, oral vaccination often does not induce strong iga responses because the majority of antigens cannot reach the mucosal inductive sites in the harsh digestive conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. further, ingested antigens can induce a state of immune tolerance  <cit> . given the poor immunogenicity of oral vaccines, the use of an appropriate mucosal adjuvant may be important for successful mucosal vaccination. although some toxin adjuvants including cholera toxin and e. coli heat-labile toxin have been suggested as mucosal vaccine adjuvants, safety concerns prevent their use in clinical applications. several cytokines including interleukin- <dig>  <cit> , − <dig>  <cit> , − <dig>  <cit>  and type i interferon-γ  <cit>  have also been investigated as safe and non-toxic mucosal adjuvants; however, they have generally showed poor efficacy . hence, we need a new approach to enhance mucosal immunity in response to oral vaccines.

m cells are specialized epithelial cells in the follicle-associated epithelium  that overlies gut-associated lymphoid tissue  in peyer’s patches. m cells transport luminal organisms and particles passing through the intestine toward the galt, and thus play a central role in the initiation of an intestinal immune response  <cit> . m cells account for only 10 % of fae cells in rodents, and 5 % in humans  <cit> . due to the low numbers of m cells in the intestinal tract, targeting m cells using synthetic peptides  <cit>  or pathogen-exploited molecules  <cit>  could be a promising approach for enhancing oral vaccine potency.

de novo differentiation of m cells is stimulated by pathogens or foreign antigens, and induces up-regulation of transport in peyer’s patches, thereby enhancing protective immune responses  <cit> . increasing the number of m cells can thus be a promising biomimetic strategy to enhance the efficacy of an oral vaccination. in recent, the importance of receptor activator of nf-kb ligand  in controlling m cell differentiation in peyer’s patches has been increasingly recognized . rankl is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily that has diverse functions mediated by its interaction with rank. in the body, rankl is produced as a transmembrane protein, but it can be cleaved by several metalloproteinases  <cit>  and released in its soluble extracellular form . rank-rankl molecular signaling is an essential regulator of bone remodeling, inducing the fusion of osteoclast progenitors into osteoclasts  <cit> , and important in the establishment of the thymic microenvironment and the lymph node  <cit> . in peyer’s patches, rankl expression by subepithelial stromal cells shows a polarized pattern, while rank is expressed throughout the epithelial cells of the small intestine  <cit> . this localization indicates a possible function of rankl in gut mucosal immunity. the role of rankl in m cell development was first demonstrated in vivo by the finding that rankl null mice have less than 2 % of wild-type levels of m cells, and the number of m cells is rescued by administration of exogenous rankl for 7 days  <cit> . rankl induces the expression of the ets transcription factor spi-b in epithelial precursors, which differentiate into m cells  <cit> .

here, we examined the adjuvant potential of rankl, expecting that oral delivery of recombinant rankl would increase the number of m cells in the intestine. for efficient oral delivery of srankl, lactococcus lactis  il <dig> was used as a live carrier because it protects the recombinant protein from the low ph of the stomach, and from enzymatic degradation during passage through the intestinal tract.  <cit> . the biological activity of srankls was confirmed by observing rank-rankl signaling in vitro. m cell development in response to oral recombinant l. lactis was demonstrated by staining with gp- <dig>  an m cell marker. srankl enhanced the protective antibody response against a model subunit antigen, m-bmpb   <cit>  developed to protect pigs from brachyspira hydrosenteriae, which causes muco-hemorrhagic dysentery  <cit> .

RESULTS
production and secretion of srankls from recombinant l. lactis
the recombinant l. lactis il  <dig> expressing secretory form of  <dig> amino acid srankl  <cit>   was prepared using pilptuf vector system previously constructed by our group  <cit> . to permit the production and secretion of protein, srankl was conjugated with usp <dig> signal peptide  <cit> . the schematic illustration of gene constructs and expression vector system is shown in fig. 1a.fig.  <dig>

to examine the expression and secretion of srankls from recombinant srankl-lab, the cytosolic and secreted protein fractions were separately prepared and analyzed by western blot. the bands of srankl protein from intracellular and extracellular  protein of l. lactis on western blot are shown in fig. 1b. the srankls was detected in lane c , lane  <dig>  while no band was detected in lane  <dig> . in addition, band of srankl was detected from secreted protein fraction of srankl-lab, confirming that conjugation of usp <dig> signal peptide greatly improved secretion of srankl. the secreted protein had lower molecular weight than cytosolic srankl because usp <dig> signal peptide was detached from protein while secreted from cells. for quantification of srankl expression level, enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent assays  was conducted. it was determined that 109 cfu/ml  of srankl-lab produces 193 ng/ml of srankl and secrets 60 ng/ml.

physiological characterization of srankl-lab
to examine the physiological characteristics of srankl-lab under metabolic burden of foreign protein expression, patterns of growth and lactic acid production of srankl-lab were analyzed during cultivation at 30 °c. as shown in fig.  <dig> all of groups showed similar patterns of growth and ph decrease. although srankl-lab showed slightly delayed growth rate compared to wild-type l. lactis il <dig> , there was no statistical difference , and all of groups reached stationary phase and minimum level of ph at 10 h of cultivation . these results suggest that production of srankl does not affect to normal physiology in srankl-lab.fig.  <dig> physiological characterization of recombinant srankl-lab. a growth of wt-lab and srankl-lab was traced by measuring od value at a wavelength of 600 nm. b the ph of wt-lab and srankl-lab was measured. the growth and ph were measured every 2 h for 12 h and at 24 h after inoculation



validation of the biological activity of recombinant srankls in vitro
we tested the biological activity of recombinant srankl produced by srankl-lab by observing the stimulation of rank-rankl signaling in vitro. raw  <dig>  cells  were used for the assay because they express endogenous rank and are able to form osteoclast-like cells in response to rankl  <cit> . we analyzed the expression of key molecules in the rank-rankl signaling pathway  that are related to osteoclast differentiation.

culture media containing secreted srankl was directly applied to raw <dig>  cells at 20 ng/ml of recombinant srankl. in addition, media from wt-lab was used as a negative control, and commercial srankl as a positive control  <cit> .

to optimize the concentration of srankl, a variety of concentrations of commercial srankl was applied to raw <dig>  cells, and the expression of rank-rankl signaling molecules was analyzed. traf <dig>  nfatc <dig> and trap mrna expression levels were increased by increasing the concentration of purified commercial srankl protein. we used 20 ng/ml in our experiments because it sufficiently elicited rank-rankl signaling . as shown in fig. 3a-c, treatment with culture media containing recombinant srankl  also induced significant increases of traf <dig>  nfatc <dig> and trap mrna compared with the wt-lab group, implying that recombinant srankl can elicit rank-rankl signaling transduction. the efficacy of induction of rank-rankl signaling molecules by recombinant srankl was higher than commercial rankl at the same concentration, which may be due to the different origins of srankl and the different positions in srankl expression sites.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of rank-rankl signaling-related gene expression to validate the functional activity of srankl. the mrna expressions of a traf <dig>  b nfatc <dig> and c trap were analyzed at day  <dig> after exposure of media of wt-lab, commercial srankl  or media of srankl-lab containing 20 ng/ml of srankl to raw  <dig>  cells. the mrna levels were normalized by gapdh expression, and expressed as relative gene expression compared to control. for significance tests, a one-way analysis of variance  followed by tukey’s post-hoc test were used, and expressed as follows; *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 



m cell development induced by recombinant srankl in vivo
srankl-lab was orally administered to mice for consecutive seven days based on prior studies  <cit> , and the concentration of m cells in peyer’s patches was analyzed by whole mount immunohistochemistry . on day  <dig>  peyer’s patches were isolated from the small intestine, and an m cell-specific marker gp- <dig> was used for immunostaining. as shown in fig. 4a, gp- <dig> activity was clearly increased in the srankl-lab group. the intensity of gp- <dig> was  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher than the control and wt-lab group, when analyzed using the imagej program. in addition, morphometric analysis  <cit>  indicated that the density of gp2+ cells was  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher than the control and wt-lab group, respectively . these results suggests that secreted srankl from orally administered srankl-lab efficiently induced m cell development in vivo. in addition, the kinetics of m cells development by srankl-lab was observed by staining for gp- <dig> at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after the first treatment with srankl-lab. an increase of gp- <dig> signal was observed on day  <dig>  and further increases of the signal were shown on days  <dig> and  <dig> .fig.  <dig>

evaluation of recombinant srankl as a potent mucosal adjuvant
to investigate the adjuvant effect of srankl, the model antigen m-bmpb was administered orally after treatment with srankl-lab. the immunization schedule and the time of sampling are shown in fig. 6a. at days  <dig> and  <dig> after the first immunization, the levels of m-bmpb-specific total serum igg, igg <dig>  igg2a, fecal iga and intestinal iga were monitored by elisa and expressed as od values. m-bmpb specific serum igg in the srankl-lab group was  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher than wt-lab at days  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . the level was  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher than the pbs-treated groups at days  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. although significant differences in serum igg were not observed between the igg levels of wt-lab and srankl-lab groups, consistent enhancements of igg in the srankl-lab group were observed. to investigate the effect of srankl on igg subtypes, we analyzed serum igg <dig>  a th <dig> antibody isotype and igg2a, a th <dig> isotype. both igg <dig> and igg2a levels were elevated by treatment with srankl-lab; however, an alteration of th <dig> and th <dig> antibody balance was not observed .fig.  <dig> validation of srankl-lab as oral adjuvant in vivo. a schematic view of srankl-lab treatment, priming-boosting and sampling schedule . b m-bmpb-specific total serum igg levels at days of  <dig> and c  <dig>  and d igg <dig> subtype and e igg2a subtype at day  <dig> after priming were determined by elisa and expressed as od value . f m-bmpb-specific fecal iga levels at days of  <dig> and g  <dig>  and h intestinal iga levels at day  <dig> were measured with the same method. pbs/pbs; oral administration with pbs for every 7 days and immunization with pbs. pbs/m-bmpp; oral administration with pbs for every 7 days and immunization with m-bmpb. wt/m-bmpp; oral administration with 2 × 108 cfu of wt-lab for every 7 days and immunization with m-bmpp. srankl/m-bmpp; oral administration with 2 × 108 cfu of srankl-lab every 7 days and immunization with m-bmpb. for significance tests, a one-way analysis of variance  followed by tukey’s post-hoc test were used, and expressed as follows; *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 



we also analyzed the effect of srankl-lab treatment on fecal and intestinal iga production. fecal iga levels in the srankl-lab-treated group were significantly higher than the wt-lab-treated group  and the pbs-treated group  . similarly, at day  <dig> after the first immunization, oral administration of srankl-lab also enhanced intestinal iga levels . these results clearly show that m cell development by pre-treatment with srankl-lab improved the induction of m-bmpb iga and igg antibody responses.

discussion
m cell induction by microbes and toxins is a protective strategy that increases the gut’s ability to transport pathogens into lymph nodes, thus initiating a protective immune response. in that context, we hypothesized that stimulation of m cells before vaccination would affect the mucosal immune response. rankl−/− mice have less than 2 % of wild-type levels of m cells in peyer’s patches, and the m cell deficit is corrected by administration of exogenous rankl, implying a critical role of rank-rankl signaling in m cell development. the effect of oral administration of srankl on m cells, however, has not been investigated. in this work, srankl was administered orally for two reasons: first, to measure its impact on the gastrointestinal tract where peyer’s patches exist, and second, to make administration easier.

we utilized l. lactis as a live oral delivery vehicle by engineering it to express rankl because l. lactis can survive passage through the stomach and bile acid. in general, the production of exogenous protein by lab can occur in three different locations: intracellular, extracellular and cell wall-anchored  <cit> . it has been generally accepted that cell-wall anchored antigens provide the highest immune responses due to easy processing by antigen-presenting cells  <cit> . however, srankl must directly interact with rank expressed on the subepithelium; thus, srankl-lab was constructed to secret srankl extracellularly by conjugating it with the usp <dig> signal peptide, which targets proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane. following cleavage of the usp <dig> peptide, the mature srankl protein is released extracellularly, resulting in a direct interaction with the environment. we measured a 24 % secretion efficiency  when analyzed by western blot and elisa. in addition, strong and constitutive expression of srankl was driven by a ptuf promoter, which was previously isolated by our group  <cit>  and determined to work in vitro and in the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . the high-level protein expression can overburden the metabolic capacities of the host and may inhibit normal physiology. in spite of high-efficiency srankl expression, the growth pattern and lactic acid production of srankl-lab were similar to wt-lab, suggesting that the basic physiology of the recombinant strain was not severely modified.

furthermore, we characterized the functional activity of srankl produced from srankl-lab in vitro. rankl is a key cytokine in osteoclast differentiation via the rank-rankl signaling pathway. therefore, the expression of rank-rankl signaling molecules is a good indicator of the function of recombinant srankl. we analyzed traf <dig>  nfatc <dig> and trap gene expression as key molecules in the rank-rankl signaling pathway by real-time quantitative reverse transcription pcr . binding of rankl to rank expressed on raw  <dig>  results in recruitment of traf <dig> , which activates nf-kb and jnk/c-jun, and stimulates c-fos induction. nf-kb and c-fos induce nfatc <dig>  expression and in the nucleus, nfatc <dig> works together with other transcription factors to induce various osteoclast-specific genes including trap   <cit> .

the culture media containing recombinant srankl and commercial srankl promoted the expressions of rank-rankl signaling molecules, while the culture media of wt-lab did not induce the signaling pathway when analyzed by qrt-pcr. although the expression levels of rank-rankl signaling-related genes were higher in the recombinant srankl group than in the commercial srankl group, a comparison of their functional activity seems inappropriate because they have different positions and expression sites. the commercial srankl contains amino acids 152– <dig>  while our recombinant srankl contains amino acids 137– <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the presence of erythromycin in the culture medium of srankl-lab may affect the expression of rank-rankl signaling-related genes.

this study was inspired by a report demonstrating that exogenous administration of rankl nearly reconstitutes the m cells of rankl−/− mice, proving the m cell developmental function of rankl even after the immune system has matured  <cit> . first, we examined whether m cell development could be stimulated by oral administration of srankl-lab. daily administration of 2 × 108 cfu  of srankl-lab for seven days led to an approximately  <dig> -fold increase of m cells in peyer’s patches. given the ptuf promoter activity in the intestinal tract  <cit> , it is reasonable to assume that the secreted srankl elicited rank-rankl signaling in the subepithelium. second, the efficacy of srankl-lab as an oral adjuvant was validated by oral vaccination of mice with m-bmpb, a model antigen  <cit> . m-bmpb is comprised of an m cell targeting peptide isolated by phage display, and bmpb, an outer envelope protein from brachyspira. m-bmpb was previously shown to target m cells and elicit higher antibody responses than a conventional bmpb antigen. hence, it was hypothesized that an increase of m cell numbers would enhance mucosal immune responses. after induction of m cell development with srankl-lab, priming-boosting with m-bmpb was conducted via the oral route. treatment with the m-bmpb antigen without srankl-lab did not elicit an antibody responses, which implies that oral vaccination with soluble protein antigens requires an efficient mucosal adjuvant. although no significant difference was detected in m-bmpb-specific serum igg between the srankl-lab-treated group and the wt-lab-treated group, a trend of enhancement of serum igg responses was observed in the srankl-lab group. the ratios of igg2a to igg <dig>  an indicator of th <dig> or th <dig> type responses, respectively, were not altered by treatment with srankl-lab. importantly, iga in fecal extracts and intestinal lavage fluid in the srankl-lab group was significantly higher than the other groups, which suggests that m cell development by srankl increased the antigen transcytotic capability of fae, and thereby enhanced the mucosal immune response. our results demonstrate the potential of our adjuvant candidate, srankl. although oral administration of srankl-lab for seven days stimulated m cell development and enhanced mucosal immune responses, an optimal schedule of adjuvant treatment needs to be further explored to maximize vaccine effect.

CONCLUSIONS
m cells play a central role in the initiation of an intestinal immune response by transporting foreign antigen to peyer’s patches. in that sense, increasing the number of m cells could be a promising strategy for enhancing oral vaccine potency. our approach was based on the knowledge that rankl signaling is sufficient to induce the m cell development in the intestine. to utilize the rankl as novel oral adjuvant, we constructed recombinant l. lactis il <dig> expressing and secreting srankl, and demonstrated its adjuvant potential in vivo. we found that oral administration of srankl-lab enhances the systemic and mucosal immune responses to oral vaccine by increasing m cell number, and thus facilitating the transcytotic ability of fae.
