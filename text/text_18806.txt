BACKGROUND
cassava, manihot esculenta crantz, is a tropical crop that is important for food security and income generation for many poor farmers in several asian and african countries. fresh tubers of cassava are suitable for consumption by both humans and animals, and provide the most important dietary source of calories for more than a billion people in about  <dig> countries, providing an estimated one third of calorie intake  <cit> . cassava’s tolerance to unfavourable conditions and abiotic stress make it an excellent crop, in comparison with other cereals such as wheat, rice and maize, for small-scale farmers with limited resources.  <cit> . cassava starch is being exploited for its numerous industrial applications, including bioethanol, processing for the paper industry, pellets for animal feed, and thickeners in the food industry  <cit> .

cassava mosaic disease  is the most important biotic constraint of cassava production in sub-saharan africa  <cit> . cmd is caused by whitefly-transmitted viruses of the genus begomovirus , including south african cassava mosaic virus-    <cit> . sacmv has two circular dna molecules, designated dna-a and dna-b, of approximately  <dig>  kb, both of which are required for systemic infection of plants. six genes are encoded by dna-a, whereas two genes are encoded by dna-b. dna-a viral strand encodes for the coat protein  , and av <dig> which functions as a suppressor of host rna silencing, thereby modulating symptoms, or may also be involved in host specificity. the minus strand of dna-a has four open reading frames  that encode for the rep associated protein , a transcriptional activator , a replication enhancer , and the ac <dig> protein. the ac <dig> orf lies entirely embedded within the coding region of the rep protein, and it is the least conserved of all the geminiviral proteins, both in sequence and in function  <cit> .

in past years there have been high levels of resistance/tolerance to cmd found in several nigerian cassava landraces including tme <dig> . by using classical genetic techniques such as genetic mapping, resistance in several cassava cultivars was thought to be attributed to the presence of a major dominant resistance  gene, namely cmd <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, several molecular markers have been associated with cmd <dig>  including ssry <dig>  ns <dig> and rme <dig>  <cit> . currently, further efforts are being made in order to dissect the genetic architecture of cassava resistance and other economically important traits using an est-derived snp and ssr genetic linkage map approach  <cit> . however, more recently, in addition to the activation of effector triggered immunity by r genes, host rna silencing has been identified as a major antiviral defence mechanism  <cit> . viruses can both induce and target rna silencing, and have evolved a number of strategies to overcome rna-silencing mediated host defence mechanisms via their multifunctional proteins, some of which can act as suppressors of rna silencing , and which are also able to interfere with host mirna pathways leading to disease induction and symptoms . viral genome methylation has also been shown to be an epigenetic defence against dna geminiviruses  <cit> . plants use methylation as a defence against dna viruses, which geminviruses counter by inhibiting global methylation. in a study with beet curly top virus  in arabidopsis plants, tissue recovered from infection showed hypermethylated bctv dna, and ago <dig> was required for recovery  <cit> . symptom remission or ‘recovery’ is a phenomenon reported in several plant studies, including pepper infected with the geminivirus, pepper golden mosaic virus   <cit> , and has been associated with tgs and post-transcriptional gene silencing  mechanisms  <cit> .

plants have developed both highly specialized defence responses to prevent and limit disease. many disease responses are activated locally at the site of infection, and can spread systemically when a plant is under pathogen attack . this initial response is usually termed basal or broad immunity which may be sufficient to combat the viral pathogen, or may lead to further specific resistant responses, namely induced resistance, often triggered by specific recognition and interaction between virus and host resistance proteins encoded by r genes . this defence activation may be to the detriment of the plant, as fitness costs may often outweigh the benefits, because energy and resources are redirected toward defence, and normal cellular processes such as growth and yield are affected  <cit> . in many cases, in the absence of a speedy, effective and persistent basal immune response, plants will be susceptible, unless virus-specific r genes are present in that plant species/cultivar/variety. in order to minimise fitness costs, signalling molecules and pathways coordinating pathogen-specific defences are activated. signalling molecules are predominantly regulated by salicyclic acid , jasmonic acid , and ethylene  pathways which are known to act synergistically or antagonistically with each other in order to minimise fitness costs. specific induced resistance is usually associated with direct pathogen recognition, resulting in limited or inhibited pathogen spread, programmed cell death, or hypersensitive response , often followed by systemic signalling and systemic acquired resistance   <cit> . in susceptible hosts, basal defences are initiated but are not fast or effective enough to limit pathogen growth, allowing the pathogen to replicate and spread systemically. activated defence responses result from several possible signalling pathways, including reactive oxygen species , signalling molecules, and pathogenesis-related proteins , which lead to biochemical and morphological alterations in the host plant such as cell-wall reinforcement and transmembrane reconfiguration  <cit> . the outcome between susceptibility and resistance depends on the pathogen-host genotype combination  <cit> , speed of host response, and specific virus pathogenicity determinants which recognize and interact with host-specific proteins  <cit> . as mentioned previously, with plant viruses, including geminiviruses, the pathogen has to suppress basal immune systems such as rna silencing. many virus-encoded proteins act as host defence response suppressors such as hc-pro of potyviruses and ac <dig>  ac <dig> and ac4-orf-encoded proteins of geminiviruses .

following virus infection, transcriptional reprogramming takes place at a global level, both temporally and spatially within the plant leaves and other organs, and depending on the collective outcome, a resistance or susceptible response is initiated . disease is usually manifested due to virus-induced physiological changes and direct interaction between virus and host proteins. once a virus has successfully entered and completed replication in initial cells, it spreads via plasmodesmata through the leaf tissue or other tissues, and colonizes distal tissues in the plant, leading to a susceptible interaction, with disease as the final outcome  <cit> . geminivirus proteins have been shown to interact with a diverse set of host factors in arabidopsis thaliana, solanum lycopersicum and nicotiana benthamiana
 <cit>    <cit> . geminiviruses have been implicated in many host-responsive processes such as transcriptional regulation, dna replication, control of the cell cycle, cell proliferation and differentiation, and macromolecular trafficking in whole plants  <cit> . in addition, the geminivirus ac <dig>  ac <dig> or ac <dig> –encoded proteins have been implicated as a pathogenicity factor that assists in infection  <cit>  and ac <dig> has been shown to affect transcriptional activation of a nac transcription factor  <cit> . in particular, the geminivirus, tomato yellow leaf curl virus  has been shown to interact with a nac domain protein in a yeast two-hybrid system, where overexpression of the nac transcription factor causes enhanced viral replication  <cit> .

gene expression technologies, such as microarrays represent a well-established technology and have been widely exploited in the last years leading to a vast amount of gene expression information, particularly in the area of host-pathogen interactions . to date, only two comprehensive full-genome microarray studies have been performed in arabidopsis with geminiviruses, namely cabbage leaf curl virus  at  <dig> dpi  <cit> , and more recently sacmv at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi  <cit> . more recently, a third global microarray study was conducted in tomato using agilent tomato gene expression microarrays, where the transcriptional changes induced by the phloem-limited geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl sardinia virus  was investigated  <cit> . in another geminivirus study by eybishtz et al.  <cit> , a reverse genetics approach was applied to identify genes involved in tomato yellow leaf curl virus  resistance. approximately  <dig> different cdnas, representing genes preferentially expressed in a resistant  tomato line compared to a susceptible line from the same breeding program, were identified. furthermore, a hexose transporter gene leht <dig> was shown to be up-regulated upon infection in r plants and its silencing in r plants led to the collapse of resistance  <cit> . in another recent study, the transcriptome reprogramming in leaves of susceptible  and r plants at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi after tylcv inoculation, using a 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray was investigated  <cit> . upon tylcv infection, the genes differentially expressed in so versus ro plants  were also those differentially expressed in si vs ri  plants. in ro plants, the highly expressed genes were related to biotic stress, jasmonic acid and ethylene biosynthesis, signal transduction, and rna regulation and processing. furthermore, upon infection of r plants , the number of differentially expressed genes was reported to be three times higher compared to the number of differentially expressed genes upon infection of s tomatoes  pointing to a strong response of r plants to the virus, which may be related to the resistance phenotype.

in recent years, the introduction of next-generation sequencing  has provided new and innovative ways to speed up the identification of large numbers of genes in many plant and animal species, particularly those under biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . ngs has become the new method of choice for gene expression experiments as it is an extremely sensitive technique which has allowed for global analyses of exceptionally large datasets from transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolic, regulatory and developmental pathways to create networks that categorize interactions and function of organs or molecules at varying complexity levels  <cit> . several ngs platforms have emerged, including roche  <dig>  illumina ga, and abi solid . gs- <dig> sequencing for example was used recently to analyse the transcriptome of symptomatic and recovered leaves of pepper infected with the geminivirus pepgmv  <cit> .

several recent studies have been reported in cassava using genomic tools. est and cdna libraries have been constructed in cassava for identification of abiotic/biotic responsive genes  or to analyse gene expression in response to the bacterial pathogen xanthomonas axonopodis
 <cit> . for example, a transcriptome analysis using an oligomicorarray representing ± <dig>  cassava genes revealed  <dig> abiotic drought stress related genes up-regulated in cassava  <cit> . a draft cassava genome is now publically available through phytozome   <cit> . moreover, the function of homologous genes in arabidopsis  can be used to predict the function of cassava genes. cassava belongs to the family euphorbiaceae, and its genome comprises an estimated 770 mb  <cit> . a draft genome assembly and partial annotation of cassava from a single accession am560- <dig> was released at the end of  <dig>  <cit> . the genome assembly is in  <dig>   <dig> scaffolds, with a total scaffold length of  <dig>  mb. ninety six percent of the putative transcripts from the publically available cassava est database  can be mapped to the genome, making this a powerful tool for functional genomic studies. to date  <dig>  protein-coding loci have been predicted, and the cassava genome can easily be aligned to soybean, castor bean, arabidopsis, and rice. in addition to the cassava draft genome, there are also a number of additional cassava est resources available through different databases . some of these include the availability of more than  <dig> 000’s ets through genbank as well as two further large est libraries containing between  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig> sanger reads which was generated as a collaborative effort between riken , and ciat .

most recently, a ngs  gene profiling study was performed on cassava infected with african cassava mosaic virus , and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were identified, with the study focusing on photosynthesis-related gene expression  <cit> . despite this report, comprehensive genome-wide expression profiling data for cassava in response to viral pathogens remains lacking, and this research provides for the first time a full comparative analysis of global geminivirus-responsive transcriptomes in a susceptible and tolerant landrace, at three time points post infection. applying all the available genetic resources recently made available, the aim of this study was to elucidate the gene expression responses of susceptible  and tolerant  cassava landraces to sacmv infection at three stages during the course of infection, namely, pre-symptom , symptomatic  and late infection . these landraces were selected as t <dig> is a highly susceptible commercially grown south african landrace that is high in starch , while tme <dig> is an established landrace in west africa, known to be tolerant to cassava begomoviruses  <cit> . solid  transcriptome profiling data from six cdna libraries derived from sacmv-infected apical leaf tissue, and six from agrobacterium mock-inoculated controls was successfully generated. rna-seq data generated from the solid platform was assembled and reference-based mapping against the cassava genome was performed. in total,  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were identified in t <dig> and tme <dig>  respectively, across all  <dig> time points, and their biological functions were established through gene ontology  annotation and kegg pathway analysis. real-time qpcr was used to validate rna-seq data and genes of interest selected for further analysis. comparisons of expression patterns between t <dig> and tme <dig> at three time points post inoculation , compared to mock inoculated tissue, demonstrated that differential responses to sacmv infection occur between the susceptible t <dig> and tolerant tme <dig> cultivars, and also between time points. tme <dig> had a significantly lower number of altered transcripts compared with t <dig>  comparisons were made to a previous study, conducted by pierce and rey,  <dig>  <cit> , in the susceptible arabidopsis-sacmv pathosystem, and results uncovered similar and different global patterns or trends in differentially expressed genes between the two hosts.

RESULTS
sacmv infectivity assays in t <dig> and tme3
following agro-inoculation of t <dig> and tme <dig>  plantlets were monitored over a 67 day period for symptom development  and concentration of virus . based on trial infections, time points chosen for this study represent different stages of infection where  <dig> dpi represents early infection ,  <dig> dpi represents active systemic virus replication and movement  and  <dig> dpi represents a later infection stage . the symptom severity score index   <cit>  was used as a guideline for the assessment of symptom development in cassava plants. the mean  symptom severity scores calculated for t <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi showed increasing development of symptoms over time. at  <dig> dpi, the mean symptom severity score indicated that plants were asymptomatic  . by  <dig> dpi, symptoms developed uniformly in sacmv-infected plants which displayed typical mosaic and mild leaf distortion  associated with cmd infection and the mean symptom severity score of  <dig>  indicated that plants were showing moderate symptoms. at  <dig> dpi, plants were fully symptomatic with severe leaf symptoms  and the mean symptom severity score of  <dig>  west african landrace tme <dig>  possessing a marker-linked cmd <dig> resistance gene  <cit> , is reported to exhibit resistance to cmd. from our infectivity assay results, we observed that tme <dig> does not show early “resistance” but rather becomes infected by sacmv , and symptoms appear later  compared with t <dig>  with plants exhibiting a recovery phenotype after approximately 55– <dig> days onwards, resulting in new leaves displaying asymptomatic or mild symptoms. symptom phenotype was confirmed by both severity indexing of infected tme <dig> in addition to viral titres . the mean  symptom severity scores were calculated for tme <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi, and leaves were shown to be asymptomatic at  <dig> dpi up to ~ <dig> dpi . tme <dig> showed a different trend to that observed in t <dig> plants, where leaf symptoms, while visible at  <dig> dpi , peaked later than  <dig> dpi, showing mosaic and distortion of leaf margins from 32– <dig> dpi  . at  <dig> dpi , tme <dig> plants were displaying slightly milder symptoms as compared to t <dig> at the same time point. newly emerging leaves on plants showed either an attenuation of symptoms and had lower symptom severity scores  at  <dig> dpi , or displayed no symptoms.figure  <dig> 
t <dig> and tme <dig> infected leave tissue was evaluated for the development of symptoms over a  <dig> day period. leaves for both t <dig>  and tme <dig>  at  <dig> dpi  appear symptomless. leaves at  <dig> dpi for t <dig>  and tme <dig>  display characteristic mosaic, distortion of leaf margins and leaf curling. leaves at t <dig>  and tme <dig>  are severely reduced in size. newer emerged leaves on some cassava tme <dig>  plants , displayed an attenuation in symptoms and almost appear symptomless. viral titre from sacmv-–infected t <dig> and tme <dig> leaf tissue was measure using qpcr and is reported as the mean log concentration of dna-a molecules/ng tna for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi in infected leaf tissue samples .



real –time qpcr measurement of sacmv viral titres in t <dig> and tme3
the concentrations of sacmv dna-a were measured in infected and mock-inoculated t <dig> and tme <dig> plants at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi  . a technical replicate was included for each biological replicate. for susceptible t <dig>  the concentrations of dna-a at  <dig> dpi were extremely low and almost undetectable ), while at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi,  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> sacmv molecules of dna-a/ng tna were detected. in comparison, for tolerant cultivar tme <dig>  viral loads of dna-a were significantly lower  than those detected in t <dig> where no virus was detected at  <dig> dpi, and  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> sacmv molecules of dna-a/ng tna were present at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively . overall, viral load in t <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi was 10-fold higher than that observed in tme <dig> at the same time points. these concentrations correlated well with the mean symptom severity score recorded for both cultivars. the increase in virus titre in t <dig> over time may correlate with host gene suppression. a study by pierce and rey   <cit>  using an arabidopsis-sacmv pathosystem also demonstrated similar trends in virus load over time, but in cassava, sacmv replication levels were higher compared with arabidopsis
 <cit> . the higher sacmv replication levels observed in cassava t <dig> could be attributed to the fact that t <dig> is a natural host to sacmv, providing a more favourable replication-competent environment.

solid transcriptome data for analysis of sacmv-infected cassava
sequence reads were obtained using the solid v <dig> sequencing platform in order to generate a gene expression profile of t <dig> and tme <dig> infected with sacmv. the sequencer was run in the paired end mode with 50 bp forward  and 35 bp reverse  tags. forward and reverse pairs were mapped to reference genome manihot esculenta  <dig> available through phytozome  and percentages were calculated for each f <dig> and f <dig> mapping combination for t <dig> and tme <dig> libraries . the bam files generated for the t <dig> and tme <dig> libraries are all publically available through the sequence read achive  using the bioproject accession number: prjna <dig>  <cit> .

in general, for the tme <dig> tolerant library, an average of  <dig> % of both the forward and reverse reads mapped to the reference sequence,  <dig> % of the forward f <dig> reads mapped, but only  <dig> % of the reverse f <dig> read mapped. furthermore,  <dig> % of f3 + f <dig> reads did not map at all. similarly, for t <dig>  an average of  <dig> % of both the forward and reverse reads mapped to the reference sequence,  <dig> % of the forward f <dig> reads mapped but only  <dig> % of the reverse read mapped. for t <dig>   <dig> % of f3 + f <dig> reads did not map at all. the difference in f <dig> versus f <dig> mapping results from the actual solid sequencing protocol which leads to a much higher percentage of f <dig> mapped reads compared to f <dig>  because the f <dig> reads are of lower quality, the aligner  preferentially uses the f <dig> quality scores in mapping to the reference genome. the fraction of unmapped reads may be due to the incompleteness of current cassava genome assembly in which thousands of scaffolds are still not interconnected, and also the lower quality of the f <dig> reads, as mentioned previously. despite incomplete assembly of the cassava genome, the current status of gene annotation for the assembled scaffolds on phytozome is reliable, which makes this assembly useful for rna sequencing alignment and analysis.

normalization was carried out as an averaging geometric mean of replicates for each library. normalized data was then imported into deseq r software package where the counts for differentially expressed genes were calculated using the negative binomial distribution estimated from the complete dataset. cassava transcripts identified as differentially expressed were annotated using the “m.esculenta_147_annotation_info” file available from phytozome and blasting against the arabidopsis database .

global gene expression profiling of t <dig> and tme <dig> in response to sacmv infection
in order to quantify the differential expression of genes at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi in susceptible t <dig> and tolerant tme <dig> landraces, the tag count for all genes at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi versus the tag counts at the same time points in mock-inoculated samples were computed. this allowed the change in expression between sacmv-infected and mock-inoculated leaf tissue samples to be calculated at all three time points for both landraces. after statistical filtering of the data , the total number of differentially expressed genes  were identified as sacmv- responsive genes for t <dig>  and tme <dig> . these are depicted in the venn diagram . overall, the number of differentially expressed genes  in tolerant tme <dig> infected with sacmv was significantly lower, over the  <dig> dpi period, than that observed for susceptible t <dig> plants. in t <dig>   <dig> degs were detected in apical leaves at early infection , where  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> genes were down regulated . at  <dig> dpi, this number increased to  <dig> where  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> genes were down regulated  and at  <dig> dpi, a total of  <dig> degs were detected where  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> were down regulated . in comparison, for early response at  <dig> dpi, only  <dig> degs were detected in tme <dig> apical leaf tissue, where  <dig> were up regulated and  <dig> were down regulated . at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> degs occurred where  <dig> genes were elevated and  <dig> were suppressed , and at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> genes were altered where  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> genes were down regulated . in general, a shift from up-regulated genes at an early time point , to down-regulated genes in fully symptomatic leaves at  <dig> dpi is not uncommon in susceptible hosts, as large amounts of virus nucleic acid and proteins produced during cellular infection cause normal cellular processes to be redirected toward viral replication  <cit> . it was also evident that sacmv was able to maintain a high level of transcript repression as virus infection persisted , and because cassava is a vegetatively propagated crop, systemic infection can persist for months until harvest. viruses have been shown to cause host gene shut-off in an attempt to inhibit broad spectrum defence responses activated by the plant  <cit> . although host shut-off was previously described as transient, more recently, conti et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that gene-specific and persistent shut-off was evident in nicotiana tabacum upon tobacco mosaic virus  infection, and similarly, in the arabidopsis-sacmv study  <cit> , persistent down-regulation of many genes across  <dig> time points post-infection was observed.figure  <dig>

a comparison of consistently expressed transcripts across the three time points, and between each two time points was evaluated for t <dig>  and tme <dig> . for t <dig>   <dig> genes were consistently altered across the three time points , while in comparison, only  <dig> were noted in tme <dig> . in t <dig>   <dig> genes were common between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi,  <dig> genes were common between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi and  <dig> genes were common between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . for tme <dig>  the overlap was considerably smaller, where only  <dig> genes were common between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi,  <dig> genes between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, and  <dig> genes between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . not withstanding the different genetic backgrounds between t <dig> and tme <dig>  it was interesting to observe that very few shared genes, out of the total number altered by sacmv in the susceptible t <dig> and tolerant tme <dig> landraces, were observed. at  <dig> dpi only  <dig> genes were shared between t <dig> and tme <dig> , while  <dig> and  <dig> were shared at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively. in t <dig>  large numbers of transcripts involved in basal defence were down regulated, especially at  <dig> dpi , which resulted in persistent virus infection and susceptibility. some similar and different patterns in defence-related gene expression between t <dig> and sacmv-infected arabidopsis
 <cit>  were noted, but in the tolerant phenotype tme <dig>  suppression of  <dig>  transcripts compared to t <dig>  appeared at an earlier time point,  <dig> dpi, which suggests a more rapid response to sacmv. also most notably at  <dig> dpi, 70% of transcripts were suppressed in tme <dig>  which correlated to symptom recovery and drop in virus load .

gene ontology clustering of sacmv-responsive genes in susceptible t <dig> and tolerant tme <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi, and comparison with arabidopsis
the arabidopsis agis for the annotation of cassava transcripts were used to identify the functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes using gene ontology  vocabulary available on tair  <dig> , at each time point  for each cultivar. transcripts were sorted into goslim term categories for molecular function, biological processes, and cellular component, and comparisons with a microarray expression study performed in sacmv-infected arabidopsis   <cit>  was undertaken . regardless of the host  and platform , both pathosystems displayed similar trends in differential gene function categories representing the highest number of transcripts . while infection progress in the annual host arabidopsis was expectedly faster compared with the perennial host, cassava, comparisons between equivalent early, middle and late stages revealed a similar pattern for the two most over-represented categories in cellular component, namely nucleus  and cytoplasmic component  for arabidopsis , t <dig> , and tme <dig> , respectively. interestingly, the plasmamembrane component was also highly represented in all three plant hosts . for biological processes, cell organization and biogenesis, responses to stress and biotic/abiotic stimuli, and other metabolic and cellular processes were all highly represented categories , as well noticeable changes in the chloroplast fraction in all three hosts. transferase and kinase, and other enzyme activity demonstrated the most noticeable transcript changes for molecular function .figure  <dig>

independent validation of solid ngs results by real-time-qpcr
to validate the solid rna-seq data, rt-qpcr was performed on fifteen  genes that were significantly changed upon sacmv infection . the expression levels for cellulose synthase, cyclin p <dig>  phe-ammonia lyase, plant invertase, thaumatin pr protein, cytochrome p <dig>  jaz protein  <dig>  rubisco methyltransferase, wrky <dig>  mapk <dig>  cyclin 3b, histone h3/h <dig>  pectin methylesterase , lipoxygenase  and tir-nbs-lrr  were independently validated on cdna samples  from the solid rna-seq study. the standard curve method  <cit>  was used to determine expression values for each target gene from sacmv- infected leaf tissue at each time point in relation to the expression of the same target in mock-inoculated leaf tissue. relative expression values for each target gene were then expressed as a log <dig> ratio of target gene expression level to ubq <dig> expression level measured in the same cdna sample. therefore, expression levels are presented as the relative log <dig> ratio of the infected cassava leaf tissue sample compared with the control mock-inoculated sample at each time point. results showed that computational predictions of differential expression were validated. although, in general, rt-qpcr was expectedly more sensitive, all fifteen genes showed correlated log <dig> gene expression patterns , in agreement with those observed in solid sequencing data.figure  <dig>

gene expression ratios of fifteen genes  measured from sacmv leaf tissue at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi in t <dig> and tme <dig>  twelve genes were chosen for t <dig>  and  <dig> for tme <dig> . the expression of each gene was normalized to endogenous ubq <dig> 



differentially expressed gene patterns in t <dig> and tme <dig> in response to sacmv infection
notwithstanding the economic importance of cassava, particularly in developing countries, it has received little attention in the scientific community in contrast to the model species arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana benthamiana, or crops such as rice, potato and tomato. there are only a handful of biotic stress-response global gene expression studies that have been carried out in cassava  <cit>  and most recently, an abiotic study demonstrating the effect of cold stress on the apical shoots of cassava was reported  <cit> . a gene expression profile of xanthamonas infection in cassava has also been reported  <cit> , and more recently a roche  <dig> gs <dig> platform was applied to uncover transcriptome differences in recovered and symptomatic leaves of geminivirus-infected pepper  <cit> . to date, only one other ngs full transcriptome study has been carried out in cassava infected with a geminvirus  <cit> . liu et al.  <cit>  made use of the illumina platform in order to dissect transcriptional changes in photosynthesis that occur in cassava leaves infected with acmv. here, we present comparative transcriptome data between a susceptible and tolerant cassava landrace in response to a geminivirus, sacmv, at three time points post infection. cassava is a vegetatively propagated perennial crop, and virus persistence occurs throughout the life-cycle of the plant until it is harvested, therefore in cassava one anticipates a continuous fluctuation in host responsive genes as the virus spreads systemically to new apical leaves, where geminiviruses prefer to replicate  <cit> . therefore, there would be dynamic changes in activation and suppression of responses during the virus-host interaction where the host attempts to mount a basal defence and the geminivirus overcomes this by suppression. in order to avoid inconsistencies across older leaves and to minimize spatial variations, transcriptome changes were consistently monitored in upper leaves below the apex, where sacmv is actively replicating. while there were expected differences in the transcriptomes between uninfected t <dig> and tme <dig>  the data in this study clearly demonstrates transcriptional activation or repression of a large number of sacmv-responsive genes in both susceptible and tolerant landraces . these patterns of expression are particularly interesting as, notwithstanding some shared similarities, they differ between susceptible t <dig> and tolerant tme <dig> landraces. however what clearly emerges is that, in addition to virus-specific responses, many general biotic stress responses in cassava to a dna virus are similar to other susceptible hosts and rna viruses .

due to the large wealth of data generated in this study, we targeted genes that were common in both landraces but showed differing expression patterns at various time points post infection, or common/unique genes in go categories that were over- or under-represented, and that have been shown to play a role in plant virus-host interactions. some of these groups include metabolic pathways, defence responses, transcription factors, r genes, histone/dna methylation-associated genes, and cell-wall and plasmadesmata associated genes. for the selected differentially degs discussed below, we scrutinized the uninfected  t <dig> and tme <dig> data  to ascertain differences in transcript quantifications between the susceptible and tolerant landraces. not surprisingly, we found that there were differences in the transcript frequency between t <dig> and tme <dig> for a number of genes involved in resistance, defence, photohormone signalling and those associated with the cell wall and plasmadesmata. we predicted that the number of r genes to be higher in tolerant tme <dig> than t <dig>  however, we observed that the transcript frequency for a majority of the genes were lower . for genes associated with defence, particularly many heat shock proteins, we observed that the transcript numbers in tme <dig> was higher compared to t <dig> . these differences observed could indicate that these two transcriptomes are already predispositioned or ‘primed’ to respond differently to virus infection.

many common genes were differentially expressed over all  <dig> time points post-infection during the sacmv course of infection progression in t <dig> . induced transcripts such as pectin lyase superfamily proteins and plant invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor superfamily proteins, involved in cell wall degradation were induced in t <dig>  and may play a role in long distance movement and exit from the phloem  <cit> . additionally, transcripts involved in secondary metabolism such as serine carboxypeptidase-like  <dig> and those involved in protein/peptide degradation such as eukaryotic aspartyl protease family proteins which are involved in protein/peptide degradation were also up-regulated across time points. transport genes showing differential expression were those genes involved in cation transport such as the up-regulated potassium transporter  <dig> protein, whereas the heavy metal transport/detoxification superfamily protein was down-regulated across the  <dig> time points. sugar transport proteins such as the major facilitator superfamily protein were up-regulated, whereas cytochrome p <dig>  family  <dig>  subfamily b, polypeptide  <dig> and cytochrome p <dig>  family  <dig>  subfamily g, polypeptide  <dig>  all involved in electron transport, were down-regulated across all three time points. a very interesting finding was the up-regulated cyclin p4: <dig> gene in t <dig>  which is involved in the cell cycle and dna processing, and geminiviruses have been shown to interfere with cell cycling in a host  <cit> ; discussed in detail in pierce and rey .

virus infection has been shown to disrupt the highly ordered primary metabolism of the host plant. kegg pathway analysis was carried out for t <dig> and tme <dig> for commonly regulated transcripts using david . details of metabolites and p-values are depicted in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  noticeably, neither t <dig> nor tme <dig> exhibited any changes in transcripts associated with metabolic pathways early after infection , except for flavanoid biosynthesis in t <dig> . tme <dig> displayed a small set of genes  across time points that mapped to several pathways, notably stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, pentose and glucuronate interconversions and starch and sucrose metabolism . on the other hand, t <dig> collectively had 11% of differentially expressed transcripts mapping to flavanoid biosynthesis , biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , and stilbenoid, diaryheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis  . common up-regulated gene transcripts in cassava t <dig> across  <dig> time points, involved primarily in metabolism, were emb <dig>  mee <dig>  and ugt84a <dig> which are involved in c-compound and carbohydrate metabolism. in addition, genes such as emb <dig>  mee <dig> and cyp75b <dig>  d <dig>  tt <dig>  involved in secondary metabolism, were induced across time points, and haloacid dehalogenase  and perk <dig> , that are involved in phosphate metabolism, were down-regulated across time points. had is also involved in metabolism of energy reserves such as glycogen and trehalose. in comparison, arabidopsis showed a similar pattern of low numbers mapping to metabolic pathways at  <dig> dpi, while at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of altered genes mapped to metabolic pathways .table  <dig>

one of the most interesting discoveries, which have not been extensively reported in cassava before, was the mapping of several flavanoid and phenylpropanoid genes involved in t <dig> infection, which were prominently altered at  <dig> dpi and maintained at  <dig> dpi. genes mapping to these pathways included flavonol synthase , udp-glycosyltransferase , chalcone synthase  and phenylalanine ammonia lyase . furthermore, these genes were all found to be highly induced with expression ratios in the range of log <dig>  <dig>  – log <dig>  <dig> . flavanoids and phenylpropanoids have been shown to play a role in early responses to pathogens  <cit> . phenylalanine ammonia lyase  is an enzyme that catalyzes the first and most important step in the phenylpropanoid pathway. several lines of evidence indicate that pal may participate in defending host plants against invading pathogens, and is often associated with the hypersensitive response . this has been shown in a very early study conducted by pallas et al.   <cit> , where pal-suppressed tobacco leaves did not result in the induction of downstream pr proteins in systemic leaves which therefore impaired an active defence response against tmv. more recently, hoa et al.   <cit>  demonstrated that pal was highly induced  in a resistant rice variety early hours after infection with rice stripe virus, but not in a susceptible variety, suggesting that pal plays a defence response. similarly, the silencing of a pathogen-inducible udp-glycosyltransferase in tobacco resulted in the depletion of udp-glycosyltransferase in tobacco which enhanced oxidative stress and weakened resistance of silenced tobacco plants to tmv infection  <cit> . we, however, observed the activation of pal, chs and udp-glycosyltransferase only at middle to late stages of infection in t <dig> , which is not unexpected as t <dig> is highly susceptible and unable to successfully mount an effective resistance response. the expression of pal and chs in particular was sustained across the time points, and it is not uncommon for a host to continue to mount basal immune responses throughout infection, albeit not timeously or sufficiently to effective limit replication and spread. in the sacmv-arabidopsis study  <cit> , pal and peroxidase also continued to be highly expressed over early, middle and late stages of infection. in contrast in tme <dig>  there appeared to be no basal defence response at  <dig> dpi related to secondary metabolites, and 74% of altered transcripts were down-regulated. it has been hypothesized from other studies, that plant hosts that suppress disease responses in a regulated manner, resulting in delayed or mild disease symptoms may be regarded as tolerant  <cit> .

differential regulation of resistance  associated gene homologues in t <dig> and tme3
transcript quantification showed that t <dig> had a far greater change in the number of differentially expressed genes as well as the magnitude of expression changes across time points compared with tme <dig> . however one of the most noticeable observations made with regard to the transcript data, was the consistent down-regulation of several disease-associated resistant  gene homologues in sacmv-infected t <dig>  and up-regulation in tme <dig> at later time points . seventy differentially expressed r gene homologues belonging to class i-iv  <cit>  were identified in t <dig> and tme <dig>  notably, in tme <dig>  few r gene homologues were altered, and all r genes were up-regulated at  <dig>  and  <dig>  dpi, corresponding to recovery. in contrast, in susceptible t <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> identified r gene homologues were differentially expressed, with some overlaps at the three time points, but many uniquely altered at each dpi. twenty two and forty eight r genes were down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively, which correlates to high viral load and severe symptoms in t <dig> . of these identified r gene homologue classes,  <dig> belonged to class i , and interestingly only one class ii   r gene was identified and that was downregulated in t <dig> at  <dig> dpi. at early infection between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi only one tir-nbs-lrr r gene was suppressed in t <dig>  two tir-nbs-lrr class r genes were uniquely up-regulated in tme <dig> at  <dig> dpi, but were not detected in t <dig>  a single tir-nbs-lrr  gene  was repressed across all three time points post-infection in t <dig>  and several tir-nbs-lrr  r genes at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . additionally, down-regulation of several nb-arc domain-containing disease resistance proteins, leucine-rich receptor-like protein kinases and leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein kinase family proteins, were observed in t <dig> .table  <dig>

the identification and characterization of r genes has long been under scrutiny, where  <dig> major classes have been identified  <cit> . to date, research has focused on three dominant viral r genes, which includes the rx gene against potato virus x
 <cit> , rt4- <dig> gene against cucumber mosaic virus and n gene resistance against tobacco mosaic virus. the identification in this study of fifteen tir-nbs-lrr class i r genes, and presence of one represented cc-nbs-lrr  gene in t <dig>  is interesting in itself as it compares with previous cloned rx, rt4- <dig> and n resistance genes which also contain tir domains. the down-regulation of tir-nbs-lrr implies that tir-nb-lrr receptor activation in cassava t <dig> is repressed and therefore sacmv may be avoiding detection and inhibition by plant defence response, therefore promoting virus replication and movement. furthermore, suppression of tir-nbs-lrr could negatively affect other signalling pathways downstream of tir-activation such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. collectively, the high number of repressed r genes at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi in t <dig> strongly supports a significant role in susceptibility to sacmv.

resistance to cmd from wild-species such as manihot glaziovii
 <cit>  was shown to be polygenic and recessive , while in several african landraces, including tme <dig>  additional sources of durable resistance were identified  <cit> , and were associated with a dominant r gene   <cit> . subsequently, markers associated with the cmd <dig> trait were used in marker-assisted introgression of the gene into other genotypes  <cit>  to understand its complementarity with cmd <dig>  and results revealed that the landraces exhibit polygenic inheritance and that the genes are not linked and were non-allelic  <cit> . however despite these many studies, the genetics of resistance in cassava is not understood. in a recent study by gedil et al.  <cit> , they identified only  <dig> putative nbs-lrr r gene analogues from cdna and dna amplification in tme <dig> and surprisingly a higher number  in the highly susceptible landrace tme <dig>  from this study, infectivity assays, virus load and transcriptome data for tme <dig> do not demonstrate early r gene-mediated responses in this landrace. rather, results from this study point to a tolerance mechanism in tme <dig> as a result of highly suppressed transcripts at  <dig> dpi and mild symptoms , activation of some defence-related genes at  <dig> dpi, followed at  <dig> dpi by a recovery phenotype associated with a high number of repressed transcripts, thus creating an unfavourable cellular environment to support sacmv infection. although cassava resistance genes cmd <dig> and cmd <dig> have been located on linkage maps of cassava, these genes have not yet been identified and mapped to any scaffolds of version  <dig>  of the cassava draft genome presently available through phytozome, and therefore the potential role of these two genes in cmd resistance remains to be elucidated. in summary, the remarkable lack of r gene response in the tolerant tme <dig> landrace at  <dig> dpi, in comparison with the highly susceptible t <dig> where most r genes were down-regulated, and a notable up-regulation of eight r gene homologues at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi in tme <dig>  support a role for these r genes in the recovery of tme <dig> to sacmv infection.

gene silencing
previous studies, such as cassava infected with either african cassava mosaic virus  or sri lankan cassava mosaic virus   <cit> , have shown that transcriptional  and post-transcriptional silencing  is involved in recovered tissue  <cit> , and these mechanisms may also play a simultaneous role in tme <dig> recovery. geminiviral genome methylation has been shown to be an epigenetic defence response to geminiviruses  <cit> , and plant small rnas play a role in biotic responses to plant virus pathogens . in recovered pepper leaves from pepper golden mosaic virus , there was no difference between the number of differentially expressed genes between recovered and symptomatic leaves compared to mock-inoculated, and a higher number of genes were up-regulated compared to down-regulated. this was not the case in sacmv-infected tme <dig>  where a high number of transcripts were repressed at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. within the set of altered defence response genes in pepper, there appeared to be little difference between recovered and symptomatic leaves, but rather a new set of genes were identified including genes involved in histone modification, supporting a role for tgs in recovery  <cit> . several up-regulated histone superfamily proteins were identified in t <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi, while histone  <dig> was highly expressed at  <dig> dpi, and less so at  <dig> dpi . histone family h2a <dig>  2a <dig> and 2a <dig> were also up-regulated in t <dig>  while in tme <dig> only histone acetyltransferase of the myst family <dig> was significantly down-regulated  at  <dig> dpi recovery. histones play a role in chromatin structure, dna replication and regulation of transcription, and in plants histone modification influences dna methylation . histone h <dig> has been shown to be involved in geminivirus replication  <cit> , while histones h <dig> and h <dig>  are involved in nucleosome assembly  <cit> . up-regulation of histones 2a and  <dig> by sacmv indicates a role in replication, since geminiviruses form mini-chromosomes in the nucleus, while in tme <dig> there is no transcriptome evidence for up-regulation in response to sacmv. histone modification by acetylation and methylation plays a role in regulation of transcription and cell-cycle regulation, and while the role of histone acetyltransferase  of the myst family <dig> in cassava is not elucidated, down-regulation in tme <dig> suggests a putative role in counteracting cell-cycle dependent geminivirus replication  <cit> . in a similar study of sacmv-responsive transcripts in the susceptible host nicotiana benthamiana
 <cit> , histone h <dig>  and histone h <dig>  were also found to be induced, while in recovered pepper leaves from pepgmv  <cit>  these were repressed. the role of histone modification in plant geminivirus infection needs futher investigation.

to support a role for rna silencing or methylation in the susceptible and tolerant phenotypes of t <dig> and tme <dig>  respectively, ngs sequencing and quantification of small silencing rna  populations  targeting sacmv genomic dna a and dna b components in infected t <dig> vs. tme <dig>  was performed . normalized data revealed that the number of vsrnas targeting sacmv dna components in t <dig> was consistently higher compared with tme <dig>  in both t <dig> and tme <dig> there was a significant increase in vsrnas against dna a and dna b from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi despite persistence of symptoms and virus replication. however in t <dig> at  <dig> dpi there was a massive decrease in vsrnas targeting dna a and b, which led to a significant increase in virus replication and symptom severity, while in comparison, in tme <dig> the levels of vsrnas increased, associated with a recovery phenotype . although sirna populations can range in length between 21- and 26 nt, the 24-nt sirna range, produced by dcl <dig>  <cit>  cleavage, has primarily been associated with sirna-mediated dna methylation . notably, the 24 nt sirna size class was the most highly represented amongst the sirna populations targeting sacmv dna a and b. the 24 nt sirna populations targeting sacmv dna a in t <dig> and tme <dig> declined from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, but in contrast while the 24 nt sirna population remained almost the same in t <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, in the tolerant tme <dig> landrace the quantity increased significantly. in the case of dna b in t <dig>  the quantity of 24 nt sirnas declined significantly from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi and remained almost at the same level at  <dig> dpi, likely promoting rapid virus movement since dna b encodes movement functions. in comparison, in tme <dig> the 24 nt class of sirnas, while remaining at a higher quantity compared to the other sirna classes , did not change significantly across the course of infection.

twelve methyl-cpg-binding domain proteins  have been identified and characterized in arabidopsis and these function with chromatin remodelling proteins to inactivate gene expression and control chromatin structure mediated by cpg methylation  <cit> . one unique observation made with tme <dig> at  <dig> dpi, but not at any other time points in t <dig>  was the up-regulation of methyl-cpg-binding domain protein  which could bind to methylated cpg regions on sacmv dna-a and b, therefore inhibiting replication. this could be one of the reasons accounting for lower viral titres and the recovery phenotype observed in tme <dig> at  <dig> dpi as compared with t <dig> 

the recovery phenotype is observed in tme <dig> from ~ <dig> dpi onwards , and we conclude that evidence collectively points to durable resistance or tolerance in tme <dig>  mediated by concomitant early suppression of genes , persistent rna silencing maintenance of genes required by sacmv as evidenced by a significantly lower number of altered transcripts throughout infection, and by methylation-associated tgs of sacmv dna-a and b. this is also evident by a decline in virus load and symptoms at recovery. while in this study, there was little evidence for altered gene expression in rna silencing associated transcripts such as dcls, rdrps or agos, in either t <dig> or tme <dig>  raja et al.  <dig>  <cit>  elegantly demonstrated that arabidopsis mutants defective in a number of genes that are key players in the rddm pathway  results in hyper-susceptibility to infection with the geminiviruses cabbage leaf curl virus  and beet curly top virus .

differential expression of signalling, stress-related proteins, pr-proteins, wrky transcription factors and map kinases
for biological processes, response to stress and biotic/abiotic stimuli were highly represented categories in both t <dig> and tme <dig> . differentially expressed 2-fold genes were shown to be primarily transcription factors involved in basal immune or phytohormone signalling pathway activation and other metabolic processes, and many were similar to those reported in other biotic/virus-host interactions   <cit> . an interesting observation revealed that of the  <dig> cassava t <dig> scaffolds involved in defence responses, approximately 68% were down-regulated. in addition to the disease resistance proteins discussed earlier, repressed transcripts observed included ribonuclease p family protein , resistance to p. syringae pv. maculicola  <dig> , mildew resistance locus o  and non-host resistance to p.s. phaseolicola  <dig>  resistance proteins; transcription factors such as wrky; and heat shock proteins  which are involved in defence . in addition, transcripts such as mapks, and the signalling molecules erf <dig>  and jar <dig> involved in phytohormone signalling were also altered. other signalling and regulatory proteins, such as calmodulin-binding proteins, that are involved in regulation of gene expression and signal transduction  <cit>  were also significantly induced/repressed at different time points post infection. calmodulin-like genes  <dig> , calmodulin-like  <dig>  and calmodulin-like  <dig>  were down-regulated in susceptible t <dig> at  <dig>  and  <dig>  dpi, but at  <dig> dpi, calmodulin-like  <dig> was induced in the tolerant cassava tme <dig> . it has been reported in many studies that calmodulin-like proteins are involved in defence and signalling against pathogen and insect attack and function in pathogen resistance  <cit> . induction of calmodulin-like  <dig> at  <dig> dpi in tme <dig> indicates an appropriate defence response, while in t <dig> this is suppressed, leading to infection.

transcript levels for two pathogenesis‒related protein  genes were shown to be increased upon infection by sacmv primarily at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi in t <dig> , indicating a delayed immune response which persists even at full symptomatic infection. these prps included peroxidase  and thaumatin superfamily protein . log <dig> expression ratios ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for peroxidase and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for thaumatin. the induction of pathogenesis-related genes has been reported in other stress treatments and virus infections using gene expression tools . despite induced basal defences in t <dig>  these prps are not capable of inhibiting viral replication and spread, as demonstrated by the progressive increase in symptom severity, virus titre and high number of repressed genes over the infection period. it has been shown in many compatible plant virus-host studies, that despite progression of disease symptoms, some defence-related responses persist throughout the infection but have no effect on viral infection.

studies in arabidopsis, and several other plant hosts, have provided direct lines of evidence that some wrky transcription factors  and map kinases are involved in plant defence response. the mapk signalling pathway is evolutionary conserved, and map kinases primary role is to transfer sensors to cellular responses  <cit> . a mapk signalling cascade is sequentially activated by three protein kinases, a map kinase kinase kinase , a map kinase kinase  and a map kinase . activation of this multi-tiered cascade is phosphorylation-dependent  <cit> . twenty mapks have been identified in arabidopsis
 <cit>  where mapk <dig>  mapk <dig> and mapk <dig> in particular are stress/pathogen-responsive and have been the most comprehensively studied . mapk <dig> has been identified as important regulator in defence  <cit> , and is a negative regulator of salicylic acid  signalling but a positive regulator of jasmonic acid  signalling  <cit> . in addition, mapk <dig> and mapk <dig> which are found downstream to mkk4/mkk <dig> have also been shown to regulate auxin and ros signalling  <cit> . wrky tf’s have been implicated in many stress-responses as fungal elicitors, pathogen responses, and in sa signalling  <cit> . a study by liu et al.   <cit>  demonstrated that virus-induced gene silencing of three wrky genes  in nicotiana tabacum resulted in compromised n-gene-mediated resistance to tobacco mosaic virus. furthermore, rrsi, a gene that confers resistance to bacterial pathogen ralstonia solanacearum encodes a tir-nbb-lrr protein with a c-terminal wrky motif . this additional wrky structural feature of rrs <dig> could indicate a direct relationship between avr-recognition and the downstream transcriptional activation of defence genes  <cit> . in this study, in addition to repression of r gene homologues, ten wrky tfs and several mapk signalling pathway genes , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase  <dig> and mitogen-activated protein kinase 9) were persistently down-regulated in t <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. interrogation of the tme <dig> data at the same time points did not show any of the same patterns as t <dig> with regard the expression of wrky and mapk genes, however wrky <dig>  and mapkkk <dig>  were found to be upregulated in tme <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively. amongst the suppressed wrky transcripts in susceptible t <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, were wrky <dig> , wrky <dig> , wrky <dig>  and wrky <dig> . currently, eight wrky tfs have been shown to be involved in defence in arabidopsis
 <cit> . atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky  <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> were identified as targets for npr <dig> which is an essential component in sa signalling. wrky <dig>  a positive regulator of sa-mediated defences while repressing ja signalling  <cit> , was down-regulated in susceptible cassava t <dig> at  <dig> dpi . it is suggested that repression of this tf may contribute to suppression of the sa pathway, to subvert an induced resistance response in t <dig>  down-regulation of tfs and susceptibility in t <dig> is further supported by evidence of down-regulation of wrky <dig> in t <dig>  which may indirectly lead to inhibition of phytoalexin deficient  <dig> , which is responsible for activating expression of antimicrobial camalexin. atwrky <dig> and mapk <dig> form an indirect interaction with each other through the map kinase  <dig> substrate  <dig>  complex. mks <dig> functions not only as an adaptor protein but has been shown to enhance the dna-binding activity of atwrky <dig>  <cit> . upon pathogen perception, a complex forms with mapk <dig> , causing dissociation and release of wrky <dig> and mks <dig> from the complex, allowing for mks1-atwrky <dig> to bind to the promoter region of pad <dig>  co-suppression of associated msk1-wrky <dig> would prevent transcriptional activation of pad <dig>  furthermore, geminivirus ac <dig> has also been shown to interact with host proteins such as dna-j like proteins which are involved in protein folding and nac transcription factors , which have been shown to regulate ja-induced expression  <cit> . results from this sacmv-cassava study, support the hypothesis that concomitant suppression of nac, wrky, mapk, and tir-nbs-lrr transcripts in t <dig> leads to enhanced susceptibility, and that the disease phenotype is maintained with the avoidance of r-mediated resistance and/or other mechanisms. this correlates with viral quantification data showing increase in sacmv titre over the sixty-seven day period, as well as the increase in symptom severity over time. furthermore, although the effect of mapk-mediated phosphorylation on the function of wrky remains to be defined, we also speculate that due to the down-regulation of mapk <dig> , reduced levels of mapk <dig> leads to a reduction in phosphorylation of transcription factors such as wrky which may directly be responsible for the down regulation of defence-related genes.

phytohormone signalling
hormones, such as ethylene , jasmonic acid , abscissic acid, gibberellins and salicylic acid  are present in plants in basal amounts, yet act in a well-balanced and regulative manner during plant growth and development  <cit> . any change from normal levels of phytohormones such as those caused by infection with virus pathogens could significantly alter physiological processes and morphology, resulting in symptoms such as stunting and leaf deformation, as was observed in our study. one striking observation for both t <dig> and tme <dig> across infection time points was the absence of altered genes that are reported to activate and regulate the sa signalling pathway such as enhanced disease susceptibility  <dig>  and phytoalexin deficient  <dig> , even though induction of transcription factors such as wrky <dig>  and wrky <dig> , and the prp- <dig>  marker gene, indicate some activity of the sa pathway early in infection. this is particularly interesting, especially for tolerant line tme <dig>  as numerous studies have shown that sa plays an essential role in signal transduction pathways leading to the dramatic accumulation of pathogenesis-related  transcripts culminating in a disease resistance response  <cit> . however in tolerance, such as demonstrated by tme <dig>  sa does not play a major role in defence, as is the case in early induction of classical hr resistance. rather, transcriptome results overall support preferred ja and et responses over sa in both susceptible and tolerant cassava t <dig> and tme <dig>  suppression of jasmonate zim domain  proteins in t <dig> and tme <dig> could lead to the activation of the ja pathway since jaz <dig> , jaz <dig>  and jaz <dig>  are differentially expressed . in cassava t <dig>  jaz <dig>  jaz <dig>  and jaz <dig> exhibited down-regulation at  <dig> dpi and/or  <dig> dpi, whereas in tolerant tme <dig>  jaz <dig> and jaz <dig> were up-regulated at  <dig> dpi, but down-regulated at  <dig> and/or  <dig> dpi. in addition, jaz <dig> was also repressed in tme <dig> at  <dig> dpi. the down-regulation of jaz could possibly be attributed to the scf  complex which mediates the degradation of jaz proteins, and in turn leads to relieve ja repression  <cit> . jaz proteins are involved in a negative regulatory feedback loop with myc <dig> transcription factors   <cit> . in brief, under normal conditions, jaz proteins act as repressors by binding to myc <dig> thereby inhibiting the transcription of early ja-responsive genes. therefore, with the response to stimulus, such as pathogen attack, ja activation will be mediated by 26s proteasome degradation of jaz repressors that consequently releases myc <dig>  allowing for downstream transcriptional activation of ja. the suppression of jaz in the t <dig> in response to sacmv suggests that lower levels of jaz are available for repression of myc <dig>  thereby allowing the transcription of downstream defence – responsive genes. furthermore, lipoxygenase , involved in the early steps in ja synthesis, was also found to be down-regulated, and wrky <dig>  a repressor of ja signalling  <cit> , was down-regulated in susceptible cassava t <dig> at  <dig> dpi, further supporting a role in promoting sacmv infection. pierce and rey,  <dig>  <cit>  also reported that ja signalling pathway responses were favoured over sa signalling in the arabidopsis-sacmv interaction study, since marker genes for ja were more prevalent and highly expressed throughout the course of infection compared to sa.

et is influential in mediating the outcome of synergism or antagonism between ja and sa signalling. et is able to bypass key regulator genes such as npr <dig> in sa signalling during sa/ja crosstalk therefore preventing suppression of ja signalling  <cit> . et and ja pathways, in many instances, have been shown to regulate similar type of defence genes  <cit> . ethylene-responsive element binding factors  proteins are plant-specific transcription factors that respond to et signalling  <cit>  which may be altered by pathogen infection  <cit> , and play important roles in plant responses to various hormones or environmental changes. for example, the induction of erfs following infection by viral pathogens such as tobacco mosaic virus
 <cit>  has been demonstrated. repression of several erfs, such as erf- <dig> , erf- <dig>  and erf- <dig>   was evident at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi in cassava t <dig>  in contrast, for tme <dig>  no ethylene-responsive element binding factors were found to be significantly changed across any of the three timepoints, again supporting the collective evidence for other tolerant-related mechanisms in tme <dig>  results for t <dig> suggest that sacmv infection is promoted by negative regulation of erfs and lack of host elicitation of sa pathway-dependent defence, which reduces the defence reponse. a report by love et al.  <cit>  showed that ethylene-signalling mutants reduced virus titers of cauliflower mosaic virus and hindered long-distance movement of the virus. sacmv infection in cassava t <dig> appears to be supported by evasion of basal host defence via overall negative regulation of ja and et signaling pathways and lack of host elicitation of sa pathway dependent resistance.

gibberellin-regulated family proteins   were consistently up-regulated in t <dig> plants, particularly at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, and although the role of gibberellins in cassava is not clear, they may play a role in symptom phenotype.

comparisons between our data and that of miozzi and collegues  <cit>  indicates that there are striking differences in the the phytohormone signalling pathways changed during tylcsv infection in tomato, in relation to sacmv infection in cassava. while we observed expression changes primarily of genes involved in the ja and et signalling pathways, tylcsv was reported to primarily cause changes in the expression of genes involved in the gibberrellin and abscisic acid pathways. the differences in expression between tylcsv and sacmv indicate that the role of phytohormone signalling in geminvirus-plant interactions is variable and complex, and is host-pathogen dependent. furthermore, the difference observed in phytohormone responses may also be attributed to the types of cells and tissues infected by tylcsv  and sacmv .

changes in cell wall and plasmodesmata-associated genes
the plasmamembrane component was highly represented in t <dig> and tme <dig>  and there was also a noticeable expression of cell wall-related transcripts . in a study by shimizu et al.  <cit> , it was reported that rice dwarf virus infection in rice plants resulted in the repression of several cell-wall related genes. this cassava transcriptome study revealed that the opposite was true for susceptible t <dig> infected with sacmv. the up-regulation of several host genes that encode for cell-wall polysaccharides, and enhanced expression of plasmodesmata-associated genes, particularly at heightened infection at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi , suggested a role in sacmv movement. the same genes were not detected in tolerant cultivar tme <dig> at either time point. these genes include, plant invertase , cellulose synthase , pectin methylesterase , pectin lyase , β-tubulin , expansin , plasmodesmata callose-binding protein  <dig> , calreticulin  and arabinogalactan protein . the induction of these genes firstly suggests that there may be a large number of cell wall and plasmodesmata modifications that occur within infected cells, but whether these modifications are favourable to the virus is yet to be determined. however, what is true for virus infections, whether in compatible or incompatible interactions, is the increase in nutrient demands of the host as well as the cellular demands of mounting a defence response. the enhanced expression and activity of cell wall invertases for example and its role as in plant-pathogen interactions has been reported in several studies . several lines of evidence indicate that an increase in cell-wall invertase will result in the cleavage of sucrose into glucose and fructose which serve as the energy molecules that fulfill the carbon and energy demand of mounting a defence response against the invading pathogen  <cit> . in addition, sugars such as glucose and sucrose serve as signalling molecules  <cit>  which will prime the activation of pr genes following infection  <cit> . furthermore, infection of tobacco plants with pvy showed sugar accumulation which was accompanied by an accumulation of transcripts encoding pr proteins  <cit> . based on these results it was proposed that sugars act as amplifiers for plant defence responses during plant pathogen interaction  <cit> . our study shows an up-regulation of invertase at the late stages of infection suggesting that the breakdown of sucrose could play a role in both the energy source and signalling molecules for impending defence responses against sacmv.

also observed in our transcriptome data were the up-regulation of β-tubulin, pectin methylesterase , calreticulin and plasmodesmata-callose binding protein. a number of previous studies have implicated a number of cellular components and proteins that are localised to the plasmodesmata  and that play a role in either cell-to-cell communication or movement of molecules across the pd  <cit> . sacmv is a bipartite virus that has a dna-b component harbouring two movement genes  that encode movement proteins that act in a cooperative fashion to facilitate local and systemic movement of the virus. despite, the presence of these movement proteins, the virus is still likely to require a number of host factors in order to aid its movement throughout the host plant. in a number of studies conducted, it has already been suggested that the viral movement proteins modify the pd and alter the plasmodesmal size exclusion limits  to allow the movement of viral protein–nucleic acid complexes to neighbouring cells . furthermore, the interaction between viral movement proteins, the pd and the host cytoskeleton has already been scrutinised for many virus-plant systems . pectin is enriched around the pd, and pme is an enzyme involved in pectin de-esterification, and has been shown to interact with virus movement proteins  <cit> . it has been hypothesised that pme may act as a receptor protein which may be hijacked by plant viruses to aid in cell to cell movement. for example, pme has been shown to interact with tmv movement protein which assists the virus with cell-to-cell movement during infection  <cit> . chen et al.,  <cit>  further demonstrated through a yeast two-hybrid system, that the mps from two other plant viruses, cauliflower mosaic virus and turnip vein clearing virus also bind to pme. we therefore speculate, that the induction of pd-associated genes in t <dig> is favouring cell-to-cell movement of the virus which has can be linked to the increase of sacmv titres observed at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first virus-responsive transcriptome study in cassava following the infection of a cassava geminivirus over three time points post infection, and it will prove interesting to compare these results in future with cassava in response to other pathogens, such as the bacterial pathogen xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis  <cit> . comparative transcriptome analyses of t <dig> and tme <dig> landraces revealed that many of the responses to sacmv infection were consistent with changes seen in other plants under biotic stress, but many were specific to the sacmv-cassava interaction. one of the most significant findings was that the number of transcriptome alterations induced by sacmv in tme <dig> was significantly lower compared with t <dig>  and also in comparison with calcuv and sacmv in the susceptible host, arabidopsis
 <cit> , and may, in part, explain the recovery phenotype at  <dig> dpi observed in infected tme <dig> cassava leaves but not in susceptible t <dig>  additionally, what clearly emerged from our data, was that susceptibility in t <dig> is largely mediated by significant levels of transcriptome repression, rather than induction. also, a particularly important result for t <dig> was the repression of many r-gene homologues throughout infection, providing strong evidence for a role in susceptibility. equally interesting, repression of r gene homologues genes was not observed early in infected tme <dig> plants, but rather up-regulation of  <dig> and  <dig> r genes at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively, correlating with the recovery phenotype. based on the results obtained in this study, and on available literature with regard to host-virus responsive genes, a comparative model of some possible responses contributing towards a tolerance and susceptible in t <dig> and tme <dig> is depicted in figure  <dig>  this model by no means suggests that these are the sole factors, and on the contrary, host-geminivirus interactions are known to involve complex interactive neworks. it is also important to take into account that cassava is a perennial crop and these changes in transcription due to virus infection are likely to be modulated throughout the life cycle of the plant. it would be interesting to follow these patterns over longer periods of time, as most ngs plant virus studies have focused on early time points of infection in annual crops such as tomato, arabidopsis and tobacco. additional analysis of the phylogenetic relationship between cassava tir-nbs-lrr domains, and arabidopsis, rice, castor bean, tomato and other plant species, is ongoing in our laboratory and will also prove interesting. homology between these genes could provide some insight into the evolutionary conservation of these r genes.figure  <dig>

in summary, cmd is a devastating disease caused by at least nine species of begomovirus, and several species, including sacmv, have been identified in regions of south africa and some neighbouring countries including zimbabwe, mozambique and swaziland. understanding the mechanisms underlying cmd could facilitate control strategies to combat begomoviruses, either through genetic modification approaches or through breeding programs, which could result in conferring resistance or a degree of tolerance. the knowledge from this study will serve as a useful genetic resource for relevant cassava researchers globally. a systems biology approach is required to build geminivirus-interaction models, and complementary studies on small rna population responses in t <dig> and tme <dig> , and further gene identification and verification of candidate gene functions, can lead to achieving this goal. additional metabolome and proteome data will in future be needed to develop a comprehensive interactome model for geminivirus infection in host plants.
