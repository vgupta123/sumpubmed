BACKGROUND
vanilla is the most popular flavoring material in the united state  <cit> . of the approximately  <dig> vanilla species  that have been identified, only two are important in terms of commerce and cultivation; vanilla planifolia andrews and v. tahitensis jw moore  <cit> . among these, v. planifolia is the most valued for its flavor qualities and is therefore widely cultivated and used for the production of food additives  <cit> . the fully-grown mature fruits of vanilla, also called beans or pods, develop characteristic aromatic properties by the process of curing. the cured beans are referred to as vanilla  <cit> , and the major flavor compound is vanillin .

in spite of its economic importance, there is little genetic diversity and few genetic or genomic resources in v. planifolia. the flavor industry generally disfavors genetically modified crops, so there have been virtually no attempts to modify the quantity or quality of the flavor of the vanilla bean through biotechnological approaches. nevertheless, a better understanding of the genetic complement of v. planifolia could provide information on the still-disputed biosynthetic route to vanillin  <cit> , support mechanistic studies on other areas of the novel biochemistry of this species, such as the biosynthesis of novel seed coat lignins  <cit> , and provide molecular markers to advance non-transgenic breeding programs targeting flavor quality, yield or disease resistance.

the chromosome number for v. planifolia has been reported as 2n =  <dig>  most v. planifolia accessions are considered to be diploid with a 2c-value of  <dig>  pg  <cit> , but due to the large size and complexity of the v. planifolia genome, limited sequence resources are currently available.

the rapid development of next-generation sequencing  technologies has enabled the efficient and economical high-throughput sequencing of entire genomes or transcriptomes  <cit> . ngs systems are typically represented by roche’s  <dig> gs flx and illumina/solexa genome analyzer. in general, roche’s sequencing technology produces long reads and is advantageous for assembly of sequences into longer contigs; however, the number of reads generated in each run is lower than that of other platforms and not enough to reach deep coverage for low-abundance genes. the illumina technology provides a high number of reads for deeper coverage, which is beneficial for gene discovery  <cit> . although its short read length limits de novo contig assembly efficiency  <cit> , various strategies, algorithms and software have been developed for short-read assembly, especially for de novo assembly in the absence of a reference genome  <cit> .

using the above technologies, we have generated very large gene sequence datasets from vanilla pods at different times of development, and representing different tissue types, including the seeds, hairs, and placental and mesocarp tissues within the pod. based on previous studies  <cit> , this developmental series was chosen as reflecting the times of synthesis and accumulation of vanillin and catechyl lignin in the pod and seed, respectively. the annotated sequence data provide a foundation for understanding multiple aspects of the biochemistry and development of the vanilla bean, as exemplified by the identification of candidate genes involved in lignin biosynthesis and interrogation of their expression patterns in the developing pod and seed in relation to the accumulation of the c-lignin polymer in the seed coat  <cit> .

RESULTS
biochemistry of greenhouse-grown vanilla beans
to determine if the green vanilla beans obtained from greenhouse-grown material retain the biosynthetic capabilities of plants grown in nature, we measured the vanillin content of the greenhouse grown vanilla bean. without acid hydrolysis, only a very low amount of vanillin could be detected in the green beans. after acid hydrolysis,  <dig>  g of vanillin per100g fresh green bean was measured in the six-month old vanilla beans, indicating that the beans used in this study maintain the biosynthetic capability of naturally-grown beans as regards glucovanillin accumulation. the ability of greenhouse-grown plants to accumulate c-lignin in the seed coats has been reported previously  <cit> .

next generation sequencing and assembly of reads
to obtain an overview of v. planifolia gene expression profiles in different organs at different developmental stages, rna was extracted and cdna prepared from  <dig> different tissue samples. the tissue types within the pod are shown in figure  <dig>  and the listing of all tissue samples given in additional file  <dig>  cdna derived from rna from the two biological replicates of each of the above tissue samples was sequenced by the illumina platform, and a single pool of cdna obtained by mixing all cdna samples was sequenced using the roche  <dig> platform. for the illumina sequences, purity filtered reads ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million reads per sample and the percentage of preserved reads ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. pooling of the roche  <dig> sequencing runs resulted in  <dig> , <dig> qualified reads with an average length of  <dig> bases after filtering and trimming .figure  <dig> 
vanilla pod tissue samples for rna isolation.  a six-week old vanilla pod cross section. the pods at earlier developmental stages were separated into three tissue samples .  a twelve-week old vanilla pod cross section. the pods at later developmental stages were separated into four tissue samples .



to obtain transcript expression information in each tissue or organ, each of  <dig> vanilla illumina libraries was assembled separately using a combination of the programs velvet  <cit>  and oases  <cit> . velvet currently takes short reads, removes errors, and then produces high quality unique contigs. oases uploads a preliminary assembly produced by velvet, and then clusters the contigs into small groups, called loci. it then exploits the paired-end read and long read information, when available, to construct transcript isoforms  <cit> . using these approaches, transcripts per library ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with mean transcript length ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp . to demonstrate the quality of assembled transcripts, the size distribution of four selected samples is shown in additional file  <dig> 

an often used combination of current sequencing technologies is to mix de-novo  <dig> assembly and illumina mapping assemblies; the  <dig> approach allows the building of long contigs, and the illumina approach reduces problematic 454-generated homopolymer sequences  <cit> . therefore, to produce high quality vanilla transcripts, we employed an optimized two-step strategy. first, a combined assembly of all  <dig> illumina samples  was produced using velvet  <dig> . <dig> with 27 k-mer length, producing  <dig> , <dig> contig sequences. then, illumina contigs and qualified  <dig> reads were assembled together with mira  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . this resulted in a total of  <dig>  contigs which were considered as vanilla-expressed transcripts for further annotation and analysis. the size distribution of the total  <dig>  contigs is shown in figure  <dig>  the contig n <dig> is the length of the smallest contig in the set that contains the largest contigs whose combined length represents at least 50% of the contig assembly; this parameter is generally used as a standard metric for assembly size  <cit> . here size distribution at n <dig> was 1960 bp in length and average contig size was 1256 bp. all short reads obtained in this study have been submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive  . accession numbers for each library are listed at “availability of supporting data” section. all assembled data can be searched and retrieved at http://www.sc.noble.org/vanilla/blast/blast.php.figure  <dig>

for quality control, we mapped our results to another recently produced v. planifolia sequence dataset that did not include multiple tissue types. this consisted of 372 m bases of short  <dig> reads generated by the university of copenhagen and deposited at . the combined assembled transcripts were mapped using blast, and the results showed excellent consistency between the  <dig> reads in the public domain and the vanilla transcripts generated in this project. a total of  <dig> % of the  <dig> reads from  were able to be mapped back to  <dig>  combined assembled transcripts. for further quality control analysis, we randomly selected  <dig> contigs and designed primers for rt-pcr amplification. in this analysis,  <dig> out of the  <dig> primer sets successfully resulted in a band of the expected size , and the identities of all the resulting cloned sequences were confirmed by sanger sequencing.

mapping of transcripts to reference databases
the  <dig>  vanilla transcripts were compared to five reference databases  ncbi database; the conserved domains database ; and the arabidopsis, rice, and sorghum proteomes) using blastx with a cut-off e-value of 1e- <dig>  using this approach, over 52% of all vanilla transcripts  returned an above cut-off blast result in at least one of these five reference databases . the homology search against nr resulted in  <dig>  annotated genes. seventy eight thousand and ninety three genes were identified as encoding proteins with conserved domains, while  <dig>  genes,  <dig>  genes and  <dig> genes were identified as encoding proteins homologous to proteins in the arabidopsis, rice and sorghum proteomes, respectively. the overlap of these five database annotations is shown in the venn diagram in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
venn diagram showing the number of annotated v. planifolia genes from five different databases. the numbers of annotated transcripts found among the non-redundant  ncbi database, the conserved domains database , and the arabidopsis, rice, and sorghum proteomes are shown.



an integrated digital gene expression database
to estimate transcript expression levels in each of the  <dig> illumina libraries, the reads were mapped back to the assembled transcript sequences using bowtie <dig>  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the number of reads mapped to each transcript were then counted and used to calculate the reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped  for every transcript in each library .

in the integrated gene expression database, the expression levels of a total of  <dig>  transcripts are presented in  <dig> different tissues or organs. most of these genes  showed above  <dig> rpkm value in at least one tissue or organ. furthermore,  <dig>  transcripts showed above  <dig> rpkm value in at least one tissue or organ, and  <dig>  transcripts were above  <dig> rpkm value in at least one tissue or organ.

the coefficient of variance  reflects the variance of gene expression levels in each library. the coefficient of variance ranged from  <dig> to 496% for expressed genes, with an average of 60% . to identify a set of constitutively expressed genes, we applied several filters, including a cv of <40%, transcript level of > <dig> in at least one library, and a transcript ratio < <dig> when comparing the highest transcript level in any library with the lowest level in any library for a given gene. a set of  <dig> genes was identified as encoding transcripts that changed little during development, and  <dig> genes in the set were annotated with functions. amongst these genes are homologs of common housekeeping genes, such as genes for ubiquitin , actin and actin-like protein. other potential reference genes include genes encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , hsp <dig> and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. these stably expressed genes, listed in additional file  <dig>  can serve as reference genes for normalizing transcript levels of other vanilla genes prior to comparative gene expression analysis, as commonly used in gene expression atlas studies in other species  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
distribution of coefficient of variation  for all detectable genes in the vanilla expressed gene dataset. the cvs of digital expression level among  <dig> organ and tissue samples were sorted in ascending order and plotted for each transcript using r software.



for further validation of reference genes in vanilla, two frequently used housekeeping genes, actin <dig> and ubiquitin , were selected from the stably expressed genes list, and their expression levels were evaluated in early stage seeds and in stem by quantitative real-time rt-pcr. actin <dig> showed a similar constitutive expression pattern to that of ubi, but with higher expression level . the data are consistent with our digital gene expression database, and actin <dig> was chosen as the reference gene for further gene expression analyses. another group also recently identified actin and ef <dig> to be the most stably expressed reference genes during pod development in v. planifolia
 <cit> .

similarity in transcript profiles was assessed by pearson correlation and cluster  analysis among tissue samples. overall, pcc values ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . as expected, transcript profiles in seed tissues from 6 weeks to 3 months were poorly correlated with transcript profiles in other tissues  . lignification in the seed begins after 8 weeks  <cit> . among seed tissues, the transcript profiles in early developmental stages  showed low correlation to each other, while a high correlation was observed in seed transcript expression profiles at 10 weeks and 3 months. this indicates that there are many changes in gene expression occurring during early seed development, but little after the seed matures.figure  <dig>

annotation of tissue-specifically expressed genes
knowledge of genes that are expressed specifically in one organ or tissue, or genes that are expressed at substantially higher levels in some organs/tissues than in others can provide insights into specialized processes at work in these organs/tissues  <cit> . to detect genes with tissue-restricted expression, all transcripts were filtered to obtain those above  <dig> rpkm value in at least one tissue or organ, then further analysed in r with the package “rsgcc”  <cit> , setting the parameter value as “ <dig> ”, which means that the expression level of a gene must be at least  <dig> times higher in one tissue than in any other tissue. we found  <dig> genes that were exclusively expressed in 6 week seeds, and  <dig> genes exclusively expressed in 8 week seeds. eighty seven genes were more highly expressed in leaf than in any other organ;  <dig> genes were more highly expressed in aerial roots; and  <dig> genes were more highly expressed in the 1 year old stem . these data are summarized in the heatmap in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
tissue-specific gene expression heatmap. transcripts with rpkm values at least three times as high in the indicated tissue than in any other tissues were selected and clustered using r with the package ‘rsgcc’. the color scale indicates the tissue specificity score associated with all transcripts preferentially expressed in the various tissues and organs. the tissue specificity score is  <dig>  if the gene is only expressed in one tissue.



after sorting the tissue-specifically expressed genes into gene ontology  categories using plant goslim ancestor terms   <cit>  and the kegg pathway database   <cit> , we found that genes involved in primary metabolic processes, biosynthesis processes and cellular metabolic processes were highly expressed in 6 week old seed . the 6 week seed specific gene set was rich in genes annotated as having involvement in starch and sucrose metabolism pathways in the kegg database . genes with transport, trans-membrane transport and response to stimulus functions in the go categories were found to be more highly expressed in the aerial root-specific gene group . in the leaf, most genes were annotated as encoding photosystem i and ii proteins.

there were only a few specific marker genes for the major organ systems. more tissue-specific markers were found for roots and seeds than for leaves, perhaps reflecting the more specialized nature of these organ systems  <cit> . these subsets of organ-specific genes will be a useful tool for research into biological processes during vanilla pod development.

identification of genes potentially involved in lignin and vanillin biosynthesis
lignin is a phenylpropanoid polymer commonly found in terrestrial plant secondary cell walls. lignin is assembled by oxidative polymerization of three major monolignols, p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohol , coniferyl alcohol  and sinapyl alcohol . however, during the early stages of seed development in v. planifolia, a newly discovered polymer  is deposited to high concentrations in the seed coat. this lignin is naturally synthesized from the unusual monolignol caffeyl alcohol, whereas lignin in the vegetative tissues of v. planifolia is of the normal guaiacyl/syringyl  type  <cit> . to address potential pathways of c-lignin biosynthesis, we used annotated lignin pathway genes in arabidopsis as query sequences , searched by blastx with the threshold as e-value <1e- <dig>  and searched against the ncbi nr, go and kegg databases with the annotation of lignin pathway. finally,  <dig> vanilla genes were identified as homologous to genes potentially involved in the monolignol pathway . these included genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , coumaroyl shikimate 3′-hydroxylase , cinnamate 4-hydroxylase , 4-coumarate: coa ligase , cinnamoyl coa reductase , hydroxycinnamoyl coa:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase , caffeoyl-coa 3-o-methyltransferase , caffeic acid 3-o-methyltransferase , and caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase-like , cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase , caffeoyl shikimate esterase   <cit> .figure  <dig> 
lignin biosynthesis pathway and lignin-related gene expression in the early stage seeds and stems.  a simplified lignin biosynthesis pathway.  the expression levels of pal, 4cl, ccr, cad, c4h and ccoaomt were represented as rpkm values in the light and dark pod tissues, seeds at  <dig>   <dig> and 10 weeks, and in stems. each color represents one contig annotated as the corresponding class of lignin-related gene.



most of the predicted lignin-related genes shared similar expression patterns in pod tissues, with highest expression in seeds at 10 weeks post-pollination, and with lowest expression in the dark and light mesocarp tissues . this pattern was observed for most of the contigs representing each gene. however, although cad transcripts were, overall, found at highest level in developing seeds, some cad contigs were more highly expressed in the light mesocarp tissue. more strikingly, ccoaomt transcripts were virtually absent from developing seeds, in spite of the high expression level of the other lignin biosynthetic genes. these digital expression patterns were confirmed by quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis of selected contigs corresponding to pal, 4cl, ccr, cad, c4h and ccoaomt in early developmental stages of seeds as well as in stems. the sequences of the primers used for rt-pcr are given in additional file  <dig>  consistent with the digital expression database, pal, 4cl, ccr, cad and c4h displayed very high transcript levels in 8 week seeds and relatively high levels in 10 week seeds, while low transcript levels in dark and light mesocarp tissues. in contrast, ccoaomt transcripts were detected in dark and light mesocarp tissues, but barely in seed tissues . the low level of ccoaomt transcripts is likely the biochemical basis for the production of the novel non-methylated c-lignin in the vanilla seed coats  <cit> . this result is consistent with our earlier finding of low omt enzyme activities in the c-lignin containing seed coat of cleome hassleriana
 <cit> . it is currently not clear how the low expression of the o-methyltransferases is regulated in vanilla seeds. deep mining of transcription factors in the transcriptome database should help us to answer this question.figure  <dig> 
validation of lignin-related gene expression in the early stage seeds and stems. qrt-pcr was performed to verify the expression patterns of pal, 4cl, ccr, cad, c4h and ccoaomt in the light and dark pod tissues, seeds at  <dig>   <dig> and 10 weeks and in stems. expression values were normalized to expression levels of actin, and the expression value in 6 w dark was set to  <dig>  the results are the means of duplicate measurements of two biological replicates, and p-values for difference in expression between 8 week seed tissue and 6 week dark pod tissues were less than  <dig>   for all transcripts tested.



the digital expression database contains transcript level values for all potential lignin pathway genes in additional pod tissues such as hairs and placenta at later stages of pod development. this represents the timing and location of the accumulation of glucovanillin  <cit> . the vanillin pathway likely shares several reactions with the monolignol pathway  <cit> ; genes specifically dedicated to vanillin biosynthesis remain to be described, although forms of pal  <cit>  and o-methyltransferase  <cit>  have been suggested be involved in the process. the present work will facilitate the documentation of genes important for the formation of glucovanillin and other flavor compounds, and such results will be reported elsewhere.

CONCLUSIONS
next-generation sequencing and computational data mining tools have been used for high-throughput transcriptomic profiling of developing vanilla beans. the combined 454/illumina rna-seq platforms provide both deep sequence coverage and high quality de novo transcriptome assembly for this non-model crop species. the annotated sequence data provide a foundation for understanding multiple aspects of the biochemistry and development of the vanilla bean, as exemplified by the identification of candidate genes involved in an unusual lignin biosynthesis pathway in vanilla seed. our transcriptome data indicate that c-lignin formation in the seed coat involves coordinate expression of monolignol biosynthetic genes with the exception of those encoding the caffeoyl coenzyme a 3-o-methyltransferase for conversion of caffeoyl to feruloyl moieties. this database provides a general resource for further studies on this important flavor species.
