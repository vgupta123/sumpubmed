BACKGROUND
ophiocordyceps sinensiss, a worm and fungus combined mixture which hirsutella sinensis is parasitic on the caterpillar body  <cit> , is found on the tibetan plateau in the southwestern china  <cit> , and widely used as one of important traditional chinese medicines  <cit> . modern pharmacological studies have proved that h. sinensis contains various active ingredients which have a broad therapeutic function  <cit> . h. sinensis attacks the caterpillar in the late autumn, and by the early summer of the following year, the caterpillar has been killed and the fruiting body of h. sisnensis protrudes from its head  <cit> . recently, it is found that the h. sinensis has activities to modulate immune responses, inhibit tumour cell proliferation, enhance hepatic function, regulate insulin sensitivity and decrease plasma cholesterol levels  <cit> . as high demand for o. sinensis products grows and the supply of its wild type declines  <cit> , mycelia of h. sinensis grown under artificial culture conditions are increasingly used in the traditional chinese medicines. as the only correct anamorph of o. sinensis  <cit> , h. sinensis could treat weakness after sickness, lung and kidney-associated diseases and sexual dysfunction  <cit> . it is reported that laboratory-grown h. sinensis mycelium has similar clinical functions and less associated toxicity compared to the wild o. sinensis  <cit> . so the fundamental research of the h. sinensis to investigate its function based on genetics is becoming more and more important and urgent.

transcriptome could provide information of gene expression profiles and infer the gene functions, which has been widely applied to investigate the gene expression at rna levels. the use of next-generation sequencing technology of transcriptome could systematically provide a complete view of expressed genes and their expression levels for the organisms at a given cultivation time, find genes and proteins involved in secondary metabolism and clarify functions of the corresponding metabolic pathways. some methods such as serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> , reassociation kinetics   <cit> , microarrays  <cit> , sequencing of expressed sequence tags  and full length transcripts  <cit>  have been used to extensively study the transcriptomes. gene and alternative isoform expression levels have been quantified using deep sequencing of rnas by rna-seq  <cit> . rna-seq is more sensitive, both in terms of detection of lowly expressed and differentially expressed genes  <cit> , and expression values from rna-seq correlate better with protein levels  <cit> . in rna-seq, all rnas of a sample are randomly fragmented, reverse transcribed, ligated to adapters and then these fragments are sequenced. gene expression levels can be estimated from the number of sequence reads deriving from each gene  <cit> . expression estimates from rna-seq are quantitative over five orders of magnitude and replicates of mouse tissues are highly reproducible  <cit> . it was viable to directly analyze transcriptome of non-model organisms using rna-seq. vera et al.  <cit>  studied the transcriptome of butterflies by rna-seq at the condition of lacking species genetic information. rna-seq method can further be used to detect unknown genes, discover new transcripts, and accurately identify the variable shear loci and csnp and utr region  <cit> . zhang et al.  <cit>  used the paired-end rna-seq technology to sequence eight organs of cultivated rice, and detected  <dig>  new transcription areas which have not yet been determined.

in recent years, due to the excessive excavation and high demand for o. sinensis, the supply of natural o. sinensis has been significantly reduced. because of its important applications in the chinese traditional medicines, it is very urgent to find new ways to meet the demand for o. sinensis. with the help of low-cost and fast sequencing technologies or approaches, the draft transcriptome sequence will facilitate understanding of the genetic basis of many traits at genome level and allow the undertaking of transcriptome-wide association studies of h. sinensis, which will provide theoretical foundation that h. sinensis is an alternative instead of the o. sinensis in the traditional chinese medicines. several features of h. sinensis, such as infection and low-temperature adaption, are investigated and confirmed based on its transcriptome and accordingly experiments. the availability of transcriptome will facilitate the development of new products and more efficient production of h. sinensis. this work presented here would aid in understanding active ingredients metabolic pathways and carrying out the future research of this organism on the genetic level. moreover, the fruits from this study would further contribute to the use of h. sinensis, protect the wild o. sinensis and pave the foundations for developing new drugs in biopharmacologicals.

in this study, in order to protect the endangered wild h. sinensis resources, save biological information and investigate the important mechanisms of this traditional chinese medicine, three transcriptomes of h. sinensis under different cultivation periods were sequenced and compared for the first time.  <dig> , <dig> reads,  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained for 3d, 6d and 9d samples, respectively. after assembling,  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  unigenes and  <dig>  unigenes were obtained for 3d, 6d and 9d samples, respectively. compared with o. sinensis worm-part cdna library which were clustered into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  unique sequences, as well as o. sinensis grass-part cdna library which were clustered into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  unique sequences  <cit> , h. sinensis has more abundant functional genes. furthermore, we investigated and globally detected the differentially expressed genes of h. sinensis grown during different developmental stages based on rna-seq, and found  <dig> degs between 3d and 6d, including  <dig> and  <dig> genes up- and down-regulated from 3d to 6d ,  <dig>  degs between 3d and 9d, including  <dig>  and  <dig> genes up- and down-regulated from 3d to 9d, and  <dig> degs between 6d and 9d, including  <dig> and  <dig> genes up- and down-regulated from 6d to 9d, respectively. metabolic pathways of active ingredients including mannitol, cordycepin, purine nucleotides, pyrimidine nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acid, cordyceps polysaccharide and sphingolipid were further investigated based on the transcriptomes, as well as the transcriptome of genes involved in these metabolic pathways were predicted and verified according to the annotation information. the genes encoding exocellular hydrolytic enzymes such as protease, chitinase and lipase etc. which play important roles in the process of invading host, and the genes encoding low-temperature enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase, ethanol dehydrogenase and chitinase etc., were also predicted and cloned. the infection and cold tolerance mechanisms of h. sinensis were further investigated and discussed.

RESULTS
summary of rna-seq data sets
to obtain an overview of the h. sinensis transcriptome at different developmental stages, the rna samples were prepared from the mycelium in different cultivation phases , and poly-enriched mrna samples were subjected to high-throughput illumina ga iix sequencing. we totally obtained  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig> , <dig> reads both with an average length of 90 nt and  <dig> , <dig> reads with an average length of 75 nt for the samples of 3d, 6d and 9d, respectively. these reads were assembled with short reads assembling program soapdenovo, resulting in  <dig>  contigs for 3d,  <dig>  contigs for 6d and  <dig>  contigs for 9d . the mean contig size was 178 nt  with lengths ranging from 50 nt to  <dig>  nt, 191 nt  with lengths ranging from 50 nt to  <dig>  nt and 386 nt  with lengths ranging from 75 nt to  <dig>  nt. soapdenovo connected the contigs using n to represent unknown sequences between each two contigs, and then  <dig>  scaffolds were made, with mean sizes of 524 nt , 520 nt  and 776 nt  . with paried-end reads, the  <dig>  scaffolds  generated  <dig>  unigenes , the  <dig>  scaffolds  generated  <dig>  unigenes  and the  <dig>  scaffolds  generated  <dig>  unigenes  . unigenes from each sample  were taken into further process of sequence splicing and redundancy removing with sequence clustering software to acquire non-redundant unigenes of maximal length. at last,  <dig>  unigenes  were obtained with a mean size of  <dig>  nt. to demonstrate the quality of sequencing data, we randomly selected  <dig> unigenes  and accordingly designed primers for rt-pcr amplification. in this study, all primer pairs resulted in a band of the expected size and the identity of all pcr products were confirmed by sanger sequencing, which indicated that the transcriptome quality of h. sinensis was good enough for further analysis.table  <dig>

functional annotation
the reads of h. sinensis in different cultivation periods  were assembled, and then  <dig>  unigenes ,  <dig>  unigenes  and  <dig>  unigenes  were obtained, respectively. furthermore, these unigenes were spliced and  <dig>  unigenes  were generated . finally, the unigenes were carried out for cog functional annotation. for protein functional annotation, the unigene sequences were searched using blastx against the protein databases including non-redundant , swiss-prot, kegg and cog using a cut-off e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  if the results of different databases conflict with each other, a priority order of nr, swiss-prot, kegg and cog should be followed. using this approach,  <dig>  unigenes returned an above cut-off blast result . figure  <dig> indicates that the proportion of sequences with matches in protein databases is greater among the longer unigene sequences. specifically, a  <dig> % of match efficiency was observed for sequences longer than  <dig>  bp, whereas the match efficiency decreased to about  <dig> % for those ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and to  <dig> % for sequences between  <dig> to 500 bp . the e-value distribution of the top hits in the nr database  showed that 43% of the mapped sequences have strong homology , whereas 57% of the homology sequences ranged between  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig> . for species distribution, 24% of the unigenes  trained with sequences from the verticillium alboatrum , followed by the penicillium chrysogenum  and neurospora crassa .figure  <dig>

go and cog classification
go assignments were used to classify the unigene functions of h. sinensis. based on sequence homology,  <dig>  unigenes were categorized into  <dig> functional groups . in terms of the biological process, unigenes involved in ‘cellular process’ , ‘metabolic process’  and ‘multi-organism process’  accounted for the majority, while unigenes involved in ‘biological adhesion’ , ‘cell death’ , ‘growth’ , ‘locomotion’  and ‘viral reproduction’  accounted for a minority. for cellular component, unigenes involved in ‘cell’ , ‘cell part’  and ‘organelle’  accounted for the majority, while unigenes involved in ‘extra cellular region’  and ‘membrane-enclosed lumen’  accounted for a minority. when the molecular function was investigated, it is found that unigenes involved in ‘binding’  and ‘catalytic activity’  accounted for the majority, while unigenes involved in ‘antioxidant activity’ , ‘enzyme regulator activity’  and ‘molecular transducer activity’  accounted for a minority . to further evaluate the completeness of transcriptome and the effectiveness of annotation process, the annotated sequences were screened for the genes involved in cog classifications. in total, out of  <dig> nr hits,  <dig>  sequences have cog classifications . among the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for ‘general function prediction’ represents the largest group  followed by ‘function unknown’  and ‘transcription’ . the following categories: nuclear structure ; extracellular structures  and rna processing and modification , represent the small groups. to identify the biological pathways that are active in the h. sinensis, we mapped the  <dig>  annotated unigenes to the reference canonical pathways in kegg, there are totally  <dig>  sequences can be assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. the most representative pathways by the unigenes were ‘metabolic pathways’ , ‘starch and sucrose metabolism’  and ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’ . these annotations provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, functions and pathways in h. sinensis. cog function classification of h. sinensis was also compared with o. sinensis grass-part  and worm-part . the results showed that h. sinensi has more unigenes than both osgp library and oswp library in each of the cog categories indicating h. sinensis transcriptome has a more active expression than both osgp and oswp .figure  <dig>

reference genome analysis of the h. sinensis transcriptome
the comparison and analysis between reference genome and sequenced transcriptome could clarify their intrinsic link in structure, function and evolution of species, and further discover their common features and uniqueness. the transcriptome against reference genome analysis revealed an extensive expression of the whole h. sinensis genome . of the transcriptome reads, about  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  was mapped to the reference genome of h. sinensis. moreover,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  could be mapped to reference genes . there were  <dig> , <dig> perfect matched reads and accounted for  <dig> % for 3d samples,  <dig> , <dig> perfect matched reads and accounted for  <dig> % for 6d samples, and  <dig> , <dig> perfect matched reads and accounted for  <dig> % for 9d samples, respectively. the mapped reads were classified by both of mismatch number and uniqueness of alignment position. there were  <dig> , <dig> unique matched reads and  <dig> , <dig> multi-position matched reads for 3d samples,  <dig> , <dig> unique matched reads and  <dig> , <dig> multi-position matched reads for 6d samples,  <dig> , <dig> unique matched reads and  <dig> , <dig> multi-position matched reads for 9d samples, respectively. in order to assess the randomness of rna-seq, the randomness of mrna fragmentation was evaluated with the reads distribution in reference genes. the total number of reads aligned to reference genes was counted, and the reads were located in relative position in reference gene . more than 80% reads of 3d, 6d and 9d were located in relative position from  <dig>  to  <dig> , the reads number of 3d in this region distributed random and was around  <dig> e +  <dig>  the reads number of 6d with the relative position at  <dig>  was around  <dig> e +  <dig> but the relative position at  <dig>  was around  <dig> e +  <dig>  and the reads number of 9d with the relative position at  <dig>  was around  <dig> e +  <dig> but the relative position at  <dig>  was around  <dig> e +  <dig>  which indicated that the distribution quality of reads of 3d was better than both 6d and 9d. therefore, the distribution of reads in the reference genes was homogeneous and the randomness of fragmentation was good, it indicated that fragmentation of mrna was performed well and conducive to transcriptome analysis. gene coverage is the percentage of a gene covered by reads, this value equals to ratio of the number of bases in a gene covered by unique mapping reads to number of total bases in the gene. we found that  <dig>  genes were covered by the reads of 3d, 6d and 9d transcriptomes, and the genes with more than 70% of the gene coverage were over 90%. number of rpkm  was calculated to quantify the overall transcriptional activity of the genes . the results showed that rna-seq data obtained in this study was more sensitive, which displayed a comprehensive landscape of the h. sinensis transcriptome.figure  <dig>

prediction and optimization of novel transcripts
novel transcripts can be found by high throughput sequencing since present databases may be incomplete. gene models with a length more than 150 bp found in intergenic regions  were thought to be candidates of the novel transcripts. extensive reads mapping and clustering revealed that  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   novel transcripts with the significant expression levels were above the surrounding intergenic region, of which  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  were longer than 500 bp and provided a sufficient candidate number of novel transcripts , and most of these novel transcripts belong to the non-coding rna. we also globally mapped the 5′- and 3′-boundaries of h. sinensis genes by searching for a sharp reduction of rna-seq reads signals at both ends of annotated genes. genes whose 5′- or 3′-boundaries overlap with other genes were excluded from the analysis. the results defined or extended 5′- or  3′-boundary regions for  <dig>  transcribed genes in h. sinensis transcriptome of 3d,  <dig>  transcribed genes in h. sinensis transcriptome of 6d, and  <dig>  transcribed genes in h. sinensis transcriptome of 9d .figure  <dig>

alternative splicing in h. sinensis
alternative splicing  is a mechanism brings remarkable diversity to proteins which make it possible for a gene to generate different mrna transcripts and then translate into distinguishable proteins  <cit> . though alternative splicing is known to be universal in eukaryotes, we may underestimate the number of genes that undergo alternative splicing. recently, many new alternative splicing events were discovered in human  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . alternative splicing events mostly occur on the genes which involved in signal transduction and expression regulation, mechanisms of cell differentiation and apoptosis could be clarified by studying these alternative splicing events. to assess the genome-wide extent of as events in h. sinensis, with different developmental stages , we performed computational analysis to determine the known and putative splicing junctions and then to identify sequence reads mapping to these regions using stringent criteria.  <dig>  genes of h. sinensis underwent as with  <dig>  as events ,  <dig>  genes of 3d samples underwent as with  <dig>  as events,  <dig>  genes of 6d samples underwent as with  <dig>  as events, and  <dig>  genes of 9d samples underwent as with  <dig>  as events, respectively in four common types of as events, including exon skipping , intron retention , alternative 5′ splice site  and alternative 3′ splice site . for the data obtained in this study,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of h. sinensis genes were estimated to undergo as.figure  <dig>

in this study, ustilago maydis  <cit>  and magnaporthe grisea  <cit> , two important fungal pathogens to plant, shared similar infection process with h. sinensis, are chosen as references to develop transcriptome analysis. the ir in h. sinensis is the predominant form of as, accounting for  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of all as isoforms, indicating h. sinensis has a richer gene activity compared with u. maydis and m. grisea.

gene expression difference analysis
studies on the up- and down-regulated degs of h. sinensis were carried out by go annotation, the results were shown in table  <dig>  the number of up- and down-regulated degs were further compared among 3d-vs-6d, 9d-vs-3d and 9d-vs-6d by go component ontology, go function ontology and go process ontology and the details were shown in table  <dig>  table  <dig> and table  <dig>  respectively. there were  <dig> degs and  <dig> up-regulated genes in go component ontology,  <dig>  degs and  <dig> up-regulated genes in go function ontology, and  <dig> degs and  <dig> up-regulated genes in go process ontology. a large number of differentially expressed genes were up-regulated in go function ontology, especially in terms of ‘catalytic activity’, ‘oxidoreductase activity’ and ‘hydrolase activity’, which indicated h. sinensis could secrete large amounts of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism pathway, infection mechanism and cold tolerance mechanism.  <dig> down-regulated genes ,  <dig> up-regulated genes , and  <dig> up-regulated genes  were involved in ribonucleoprotein complex by go component ontology, indicating that the speed and efficiency of protein synthesis in stable period were higher than growth period.  <dig> down-regulated genes ,  <dig> up-regulated genes , and  <dig> up-regulated genes  were involved in structural molecule activity by go function ontology, showing that structural molecule in stable period was more stable than growth period.  <dig> down-regulated genes ,  <dig> down-regulated genes , and  <dig> down-regulated genes  were involved in metabolic process by go process ontology, which demonstrated that genes involved in metabolic processes were more abundant in stable period. subsequently, extendgene, exon skipping and intron retention analysis of 3d, 6d and 9d were absolutely compared, respectively. there were common  <dig>  extendgenes,  <dig> skipping exons and  <dig> retentional introns among 3d, 6d and 9d. comparisons among of alternative 5′ splice site, alternative 3′ splice site and the number of transcripts analysis of 3d, 6d and 9d showed that there were common  <dig> alternative 5′ splice sites,  <dig> alternative 3′ splice sites and  <dig>  transcripts among 3d, 6d and 9d. finally, the comparison of differential expression genes, up- and down-regulated genes analysis of 3d-vs-6d, 9d-vs-3d and 9d-vs-6d were carried out. there were common  <dig> differential expression genes, while no common up- and down-regulated genes among 3d-vs-6d, 9d-vs-3d and 9d-vs-6d .table  <dig>

functional analysis of differential gene expression based on rna-seq data
so far, the molecular mechanisms resulting in various kinds of functional complexity in h. sinensis mycelium have not been illuminated  <cit> . to understand this molecular mechanisms, the degs of h. sinensis grown during different developmental stages  were also used to investigate the gene functions based on the differential gene expression level in different culture times. we found  <dig> degs between 3d and 6d, including  <dig> and  <dig> genes up- and down-regulated from 3d to 6d ,  <dig>  degs between 3d and 9d, including  <dig>  and  <dig> genes up- and down-regulated from 3d to 9d, and  <dig> degs between 6d and 9d, including  <dig> and  <dig> genes up- and down-regulated from 6d to 9d, respectively . go functional enrichment analysis revealed that genes up-regulated during the developmental stages of h. sinensis were mainly involved in ‘structural molecule activity’, ‘ribonucleoprotein complex’, ‘macromolecular complex’, ‘gene expression’ and ‘intrinsic to membrane’  , suggesting these up-regulated genes played important roles and promoted the formation of cell structures in the process of mycelia reproduction. in addition, the kegg metabolic pathway analysis indicated that the genes up-regulated from 3d to 6d were specifically located in the pathways of ‘ribosome’, ‘caprolactam degradation’, ‘metabolic pathways’, ‘nitrogen metabolism’ and ‘fatty acid metabolism’, while genes up-regulated from 6d to 9d were mainly associated with ‘ribosome’, ‘metabolic pathways’, ‘phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis’ and ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’ . the results indicated that these up-regulated genes in such life stage mainly promoted secondary metabolism and biosynthesis of active ingredients, which was consistent with the description of the h. sinensis life cycle . therefore, these analyses indicated that h. sinensis drastically altered the manner of gene expression during the developmental stages to produce numerous functional components.figure  <dig>

secondary metabolism analysis and verification
according to the metabolic pathways from annotated kegg analysis based on the transcriptome,  <dig> main metabolic pathways of active ingredients including mannitol, cordycepin, purine nucleotides, pyrimidine nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acid, cordyceps polysaccharide and sphingolipid in h. sinensis were predicted, and the genes involved in these pathways were further cloned and expressed to verify the predictions. using the glycolytic pathway  and fructose-mannose pathway  as references, mannitol metabolic pathway of h. sinensis was predicted . however, the mannitol-1-phosphatase converting mannitol-1-p into mannitol is not found, which indicates that other unknown phosphatases take place the role of mannitol-1-phosphate to generate mannitol. subsequently,  <dig> hexokinase genes,  <dig> glucose phosphate isomerise genes and  <dig> mannitol-1-p dehydrogenase gene involved in mannitol metabolic pathway were successfully cloned , and corresponding proteins which expressed in e. coli bl <dig> were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  . in the kegg, the biosynthesis of adenosine  has been confirmed. to date, there were still no literatures about the biosynthesis of cordycepin from adenosine  <cit> . it is found that in the pathway of cordycepin of h. sinensis there is special simple sugars which was called cordycepose, we speculated that cordycepose and adenosine exchanged the glycosylation by the function of n-glycosylation lyase, and then generated cordycepin . the genes involved in cordycepin metabolic pathway were further verified by pcr,  <dig> adp-ribose pyrophosphatase gene,  <dig> ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase genes,  <dig> 5′-nucleotidase genes and 1 n-glycosylase gene etc. were successfully cloned , and corresponding proteins which expressed in e. coli bl <dig> were also detected by sds-page . furthermore, purine biosynthesis pathway of h. sinensis was predicted according to the previously reported purine metabolic pathway . it is found that purine metabolic pathway starts from adenosine and ends with urate after  <dig> steps of catalysis , and genes which encoding purine nucleosidase and adenosine kinase etc. were cloned , and then the corresponding proteins were successfully expressed . for the pyrimidine metabolism pathway  based on kegg, the biosynthesis pathway which starts from l-glutamine and ends with uridylic acid, cytidylic acid, thymidylic acid etc. in h. sinensis was analyzed and verified , uridine triphosphate, cytidine triphosphate and cytidine diphosphate were intermediate products in this pathway. then the biosynthesis pathways which starts from acetyl-coa and hexadecanoate and ends with docosahexaenoic acid and butyryl- were obtained in the summary of the kegg fatty acid biosynthesis pathway  and unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis pathway  , hexadecanoate was generated by fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and then used as a starting material to promote the unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. moreover, based on the fructose and mannose metabolism pathway , galactose metabolism pathway , n-glycan biosynthesis pathway  and sphingolipid metabolism pathway  from the kegg, the biosynthesis pathway of cordyceps polysaccharide which starts from d-glucose and d-galactose and ends with udp-glucose and  <dig> , as well as the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway which starts from palmitoyl coa andends with sphingosine , could be predicted and verified in the same manner as described above in this study.

discussion
the use of o. sinensis has a long history both in traditional chinese medicine and tibetan medicine in china. the huge market demand has led to over harvesting and severe devastation of fragile alpine environments, however, o. sinensis grows slowly on artificial media and attempts at solid cultivating the fungus to produce fruiting bodies have consistently failed  <cit> . to meet the requirement of o. sinensis from the market, mycelia of h. sinensis grown under artificial liquid cultivation are increasingly used as an alternative in the medicinal products. as the anamorph of o. sinensis  <cit> , h. sinensis has activities to modulate immune responses, inhibit tumour cell proliferation, enhance hepatic function, regulate insulin sensitivity and decrease plasma cholesterol levels, this makes it become more and more valuable in pharmacology. studies have demonstrated the diverse bioactive ingredients and broad medical effects of h. sinensis, but there were little reports which demonstrated genetic information of h. sinensis. therefore, the fundamental research of the h. sinensis to investigate and preserve its genetic information based on rna-seq is becoming more and more important and urgent.

next generation sequencing has opened the door to transcriptome analysis of non-model organisms  <cit> . the growing number of species for which significant genetic resources are available is sparking a new era of study in which fundamental genetic questions underlying phenotypic evolution, adaptation and speciation can be addressed  <cit> . in this study, the next-generation sequencing technology was applied to h. sinensis transcriptome sequencing, and the unigenes generated from transcriptomes under different culture periods were systematically investigated. to our knowledge, this is first de novo assembly of the h. sinensis transcriptome from a short read sequencing platform and the results are presented that allows high throughput analysis and further research for comparative transcriptomics. being an insect pathogen, h. sinensis contains thousands of genes putatively involved in interactions with insect hosts. assembled unigenes were firstly aligned by blastx to protein databases like nr, swiss-prot, kegg and cog, and the information about putative heterozygous nucleotide variations offered intriguing leads for the analysis of transcriptomic events and their effects on biological functions of h. sinensis. this study gave a new way to find secondary metabolism genes and clarify the functions of the corresponding metabolic pathways in h. sinensis. in addition, this study also provided a scientific basis for medicinal mechanism of h. sinenesis and effective protection for the sustainable use of o. sinensis resources. the availability of transcriptome sequence opens new avenues for new exploration, application and improvements of h. sinensis. it will lead to the identification and manipulation of candidate genes or genomic regions to generate the new ways to synthesize new compounds with potentials in pharmaceuticals, and pave foundation for development of new drugs for the pharmaceutical manufacturing or provide the theoretical basis for the sustainable use of o. sinensis.

the sequences of the h. sinensis transcriptome were captured by preparing rna-seq libraries from three different cultivation periods. compared with worm-part and grass-part of o. sinensis cdna libraries, h. sinensis transcriprome contained more genes which involved in translation, transcription and cell division etc.  <cit> . this study indicated that h. sinensis is more active in translation, transcription and cell division etc. compared to other insect pathogens which have similar infection processes and life cycles to h. sinensis, such as p. chrysogenum  <cit> , aspergillus niger  <cit> , metarhizium anisopliae  <cit> , m. acridum  <cit> , c. militaris  <cit>  and asexual strain of o. sinensis  <cit> , h. sinensis has similar quantities of functional genes involved in transportation, cell metabolism, transcription and protein fate, while has larger quantities of functional genes involved in cell component, homeostasis and protein synthesis. this phenomenon indicates that h. sinensis could secret and transport more proteins for infecting the host larvae and propagating in host vivo as compared to these fungi.

the life cycle of h. sinensis is poorly understood aside from knowing that h. sinensis infects h. armoricanus pupae  <cit> . its survival in soil may depend on the asexual stage of o. sinensis which provides resilient long-lived ascospores as described in other fungi  <cit> . as the asexual type of o. sinensis, in the nature, h. sinensis mainly infects host larvae in the soil through the skin of the head by the effects of enzymes and mechanical force when h. sinensis grows  <cit> . it is reported that the infection process of h. sinensis can be divided into three stages including attaching to the epidermis of larvae, penetrating body wall and propagation in vivo causing the death of host. the entire process includes host recognition, mechanical damage, nutrient competition, disturbing metabolism, secretion of toxins and the damaging the tissue structure of the host, these multi-factors interaction ultimately lead to host death and form the matured o. sinensis  <cit> . in the process of invading the body wall of insect, h. sinensis secretes many kinds of exocellular hydrolytic enzymes such as protease  <cit> , chitinase  <cit>  and lipase etc. which play important roles in the process of invading. degradation of proteases is not only helpful to the mycelium penetration, but also provides nutrients for mycelial growth  <cit> . after screening transcriptome of h. sinensis,  <dig> proteases,  <dig> chitinases and  <dig> lipases were predicted and confirmed, comparing to o. sinensis whose gene families encoding  <dig> cuticle degrading proteases and  <dig> chitinases  <cit> , indicating that h. sinensis has stronger infecting virulence.  <dig> chitinase genes,  <dig> protease genes and  <dig> lipase genes were successfully cloned and expressed in e. coli bl <dig> and the corresponding enzyme activities were successfully detected. therefore, the results obtained in this study demonstrated that h. sinensis could produce these enzymes to accomplish the invasion.

studies based on the molecular level have confirmed that nucleosides  <cit> , sterols  <cit> , polysaccharides  <cit>  and mannitol  <cit>  were the material basis for pharmacological effects of h. sinensis. at present, there are few reports about metabolic pathways both in h. sinensis and o. sinensis, so it is much more necessary and urgent to investigate metabolic pathways which will provide new information and method to further regulate, control and optimize the fermentation process to obtain h. sinensis mycelium with high quality. in order to model the biosynthesis of cordycepin, zheng et al.  <cit>  constructed the purine metabolic pathway in c. militaris based on the kegg annotations, and suggested that the biosynthesis of cordycepin proceeds through a reductive mechanism as described for the formation of 2′-deoxyadenosine  <cit> . hu et al.  <cit>  found o. sinensis has multiple polyketide synthases, modular non-ribosomal peptide synthases and terpene cyclases for producing an array of secondary metabolites, these enzymes likely play roles after the latent period when the fungus is colonizing and killing the host, and they are also potential candidates for production of pharmacologically active ingredients. according to the transcriptome annotation results, we predicted the corresponding metabolic pathways of mannitol, cordycepin, purine nucleotides, pyrimidine nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acid, cordyceps polysaccharide and sphingolipid in h. sinensis for the first time, as well as the enzymes involved in each step, which can be concluded that this study provided a theoretical basis for regulation of metabolic pathways. one of the main pharmaceutically active ingredients of h. sinens is cordycepin  <cit> , which is structurally similar to 2′-deoxyadenosine. h. sinensis possesses most of the genes required for metabolism of adenine and adenosine . for metabolic pathway of cordycepic acid in h. sinensis, mannitol-1-phosphate phosphatase catalyzed d-mannitol-1-p to d-mannitol was not annotated in h. sinensis transcriptome, which indicated that other phosphatases took place the role of mannitol-1-phosphate phosphatase or the mannitol-1-phosphate phosphatase gene of h. sinensis was un-annotated to protein database since its low homology with currently reported mannitol-1-phosphate phosphatases from other organisms. in order to ensure the up- and down-regulated genes which encoding the enzymes involved in cordycepin metabolism pathway, real-time pcr was carried out to determinate differential expression genes  <cit> . the genes which encoding 5′-nucleotidase and n-glycosylase were detected obviously up-regulated which consistent with the rna-seq analysis. in this present study, 5′-nucleotidase and n-glycosylase were up-regulated  <dig>  folds and  <dig>  folds in different cultivation periods  of h. sinensis, respectively. these two enzymes were significantly up-regulated when compared with other enzymes involved in cordycepin metabolic pathway. this result indicated that 5′-nucleotidase and n-glycosylase played important roles in cordycepin metabolic pathway, enhancing the expression of these genes could promote biosynthesis of cordycepin. this method was helpful to ensure the gene expression levels of degs which could be controlled to regulate the expression level of different enzymes and achieve the desired purpose. in addition, this result will pave the theoretical foundation to carry out further research on secondary metabolic mechanisms.

as a psychrophilic fungus, h. sinensis could secret many low-temperature enzymes which involved in cold tolerance mechanism. it is found that large numbers of lipid droplets were contained in h. sinensis cells, as described in other fungi adapted to long-term survival in frigid conditions  <cit> . compared with other fungi, h. sinensis has fewer lipases  and fatty acid hydroxylases , but it has a larger range and number of genes involved in triacylglycerol and fatty acid biosynthesis consistent with an emphasis on synthesizing rather than degrading lipids, and the h. sinensis transcriptome was enriched in fatty acid desaturases  when compared with cold-adapted plants and bacteria  <cit> , indicating this fungus may respond to low temperatures by increasing membrane lipid instauration  <cit> . considering the above possibilities, the cold tolerance mechanism of h. sinensis may lead to low demand of lipases and fatty acid hydroxylases, and the numbers of lipases and fatty acid hydroxylases are sufficient to h. sinensis adapting in frigid conditions. h. sinensis also could secrete many low-temperature enzymes involved in the metabolism which provides the basic energy for the survival. we screened the transcriptome annotation results and found some genes of low-temperature enzymes including  <dig> malate dehydrogenase genes,  <dig> ethanol dehydrogenase genes,  <dig> citroyl synthetase genes and  <dig> chitinase genes etc., which were further obtained and verified in this study. therefore, the analysis of transcriptomes demonstrated that h. sinensis has the genes encoding these low-temperature enzymes to resist to the low temperature and protect itself in the cold environment.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, three transcriptomes of h. sinensis at different cultivation periods were sequenced for the first time, and the extensive transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that h. sinensis may have important systemic effects on o. sinensis at the level of genes. the genes which encoding the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of active ingredients were predicted according to the annotation results, and the metabolic pathways of mannitol, cordycepin, purine nucleotides, pyrimidine nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acid, cordyceps polysaccharide, and sphingolipid in h. sinensis were described. based on the predictions, we further investigated the interaction of different pathway networks and the corresponding enzymes. many key or important genes involved in metabolic pathways, infection mechanism and cold tolerance mechanism were found by investigating the comparative differential expression genes from different cultivation periods.  <dig> degs between 3d and 6d,  <dig>  degs between 3d and 9d, and  <dig> degs between 6d and 9d were found and confirmed, respectively. these findings provide a substantial contribution and basis to further characterize the gene expression profiles for h. sinensis in the metabolic pathways of active ingredients.
