BACKGROUND
microrna -mediated translational repression is an important regulatory mechanism in multiple cellular processes. mirnas are a subpopulation of small rnas, averaging  <dig> nucleotides in length, which inhibit translation through sequence-specific binding to target sites within the 3′-utrs of mrnas. following transcription, mirnas are processed in a two-step mechanism involving the rnases drosha and dicer  <cit>  and subsequently integrated into the rna-induced silencing complex  <cit> , thereby unfolding their regulatory potential to regulate mrnas  <cit> . exhibiting stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns during development  <cit> , mirnas not only function as key regulatory molecules in multiple cellular processes including apoptosis  <cit> , cancer  <cit> , proliferation  <cit> , development  <cit> , and differentiation  <cit>  but also control stemness and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells e.g. by repressing pluripotency factors oct <dig>  sox <dig> and klf <dig>  <cit> .

osteogenesis is a highly coordinated process involving transcription factors, such as runx <dig> and osterix  <cit> , bmp <dig>  and other factors, that drive committed stem cells toward fully differentiated osteocytes . osteogenesis is promoted through several signalling pathways, including wnt/ß-catenin, bmp, jak/stat, and mapk  <cit> . several mirnas modulate osteogenic differentiation: mir-125b negatively regulates osteoblastic differentiation through targeting vdr, erbb <dig>  and osterix  <cit> ; mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  inhibit differentiation of mouse osteoprogenitors  <cit> ; mir-26a and mir-29b facilitate osteogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells , and positively modulate mouse osteoblast differentiation  <cit> . multiple other mirnas, including mir- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and − <dig>  have been linked to osteogenesis  <cit> .

unrestricted somatic stem cells  are a rare cd45-negative population in human cord blood  <cit> . these cells can be discriminated from cb-msc and bm-msc by their hox expression pattern which resembles that of h <dig> embryonic stem cells  <cit> . adherently-growing in vitro ussc can be induced to cells representative of all three germinal layers on a clonal level  <cit>  and have been successfully reprogrammed to a pluripotent es-like state  <cit> . undergoing mirna-supported cell cycle arrest, ussc can be differentiated into cells of neural lineage with mirnas acting as network-like regulators  <cit> . ussc also differentiate into functional hepatic-like cells  <cit>  as well as along osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages  <cit> . upon induction with dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, and ß-glycerol phosphate , ussc differentiate into osteoblasts as evidenced by calcium phosphate deposition, bone-specific alp-activity, increase in ca2+-release, and expression of the osteogenic marker proteins osteocalcin, osteopontin, bone sialo-protein, and collagen type i  <cit> . bony reconstitution was observed following implantation of ussc into nude rat femurs  <cit> . beside their differentiation potential, ussc also fulfil regenerative functions in acute spinal cord trauma  <cit> .

here we analyzed the impact of mirnas on osteogenic differentiation of ussc. we identified a set of mirnas upregulated upon induction of osteogenesis, co-ordinately regulating a distinct set of genes known to inhibit osteogenesis. among these inhibitors, cdk <dig>  ctnnbip <dig>  hdac <dig>  tgfb <dig>  and tob <dig> were experimentally identified as targets of mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b. these mirnas were functionally identified as accelerators of osteogenic differentiation of ussc.

RESULTS
differential mirna expression during osteogenic differentiation of ussc
to assess the impact of mirnas on osteogenic differentiation of ussc we studied two ussc lines  that were induced to osteogenic differentiation using dag as described  <cit> . as strong calcification of ussc during osteogenic differentiation impacts rna isolation, we restricted our analyses to day  <dig> of differentiation. mirna expression profiles of native and day  <dig> osteo-differentiated ussc were analyzed using the rt-pcr-based taqman assay  covering  <dig> mirnas  <cit> . in sa5/ <dig>   <dig> mirnas were expressed and  <dig> mirnas were upregulated by a factor ≧  <dig> in differentiated cells. in sa8/ <dig>   <dig> mirnas were expressed and  <dig> mirnas were upregulated during osteogenic differentiation. interestingly, only  <dig> mirnas were commonly upregulated in both ussc lines. in follow-up analyses we focused on  <dig> of these micrornas , which were not only upregulated by a factor ≧  <dig> but also present at high expression levels  in differentiated ussc. we omitted those upregulated mirnas that were weakly expressed in differentiated ussc due to their expected minor biological impact. among the most prominently expressed mirnas were mir-10a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-26a/b, mir-29b, mir-30b/c, mir- <dig>  and mir-532-5p. complete mirna expression data from ussc sa5/ <dig> and sa8/ <dig> osteogenic differentiation experiments are presented in additional file  <dig> 


bioinformatic target gene predictions
to investigate the biological impact of our selected set of  <dig> mirnas, we computationally identified mirna targets using the diana mirgen target gene prediction software  <cit> , which combines the prediction results of several web-based algorithms . this approach resulted in an extensive list of putative targets , many of which were recognized by more than one of our  <dig> mirnas. as our study is focused on mirnas that are upregulated during osteogenic differentiation, we reasoned that their biological impact should be posttranscriptional downregulation of proteins inhibiting osteogenic differentiation. we thus filtered our list of putative targets using the gene ontology  terms function implemented in the david database, applying search terms like “bone” and “osteo”. table  <dig> presents an overview of  <dig> proteins inhibiting osteogenic differentiation that are putatively recognized by our set of  <dig> mirnas. consistent with the view that mirnas regulate networks  <cit> , table  <dig> demonstrates target gene redundancy: certain proteins were predicted to be targeted by more than one mirna and other mirnas  putatively regulate up to  <dig> proteins .


bioinformatic target predictions for the subset of  <dig> mirnas upregulated in osteogenic differentiation of ussc on osteo-inhibitory proteins: mir-26a, -26b, and -29b were experimentally assessed for impact on proteins denoted in bold. the second column  illustrates the number of mirnas from the analyzed set that targets an individual protein. predictions with an asterix were already validated in the literature.

computational predictions indicated that the bmp- <dig> antagonist cdk <dig>  <cit>  was recognized by six mirnas ; ctnnbip <dig> , an inhibitor of ß-catenin mediated transcription  <cit> , was likely regulated by five mirnas ; and runx <dig> co-repressor hdac <dig>  <cit>  was a putative target of four mirnas . additional putative osteogenesis-inhibiting target proteins included dusp <dig>  <cit> , tob <dig>  <cit> , tgfb <dig>  <cit> , and smad <dig>  <cit>  . interestingly, mir-26a and mir-26b were also predicted to regulate smad <dig>  a positive regulator of osteogenic differentiation  <cit> .

the most redundant mirna-target network involved mir-26a/b and mir-29b and, to a lesser extent, mir- <dig>  mir-10a, and mir- <dig> ; subsequent analyses focused on these six mirnas. to avoid errors in measuring the expression of highly homologous mir-26a and -26b, we verified our taqman mirna expression data from ussc sa5/ <dig> and sa8/ <dig>  in native ussc lines sa5/ <dig>  sa8/ <dig>  sa8/ <dig> and sa4/ <dig> and in  osteo differentiated sa8/ <dig> and sa4/ <dig>  using an established small rna sequencing method  <cit> . mir-26a and mir-26b expression was confirmed in all native ussc lines and both mirnas were upregulated in differentiated sa8/ <dig> and sa4/ <dig> lines .

experimental validation of predicted mirna targets
next, we experimentally verified mirna regulation of selected targets  using an established target validation assay  <cit> . among these putative targets, cdk <dig>  ctnnbipi, tob <dig>  and hdac <dig> contained the most predicted mirna binding sites, whereas dusp <dig>  tgfb <dig>  and smad <dig> each contained a solitary putative mir-29b target site. pcr amplification products representing the 3′-utr of target genes were cloned at the 3′-end of the firefly-orf of dual luciferase  vector pmirglo. based on the patterns of predicted mirna binding sites on individual 3′-utrs , we devised the following cloning strategy for target validation: cdk <dig> 3′-utr  was cloned as two subfragments ranging from bases 147– <dig>  and 5825– <dig> ; ctnnbip <dig>  and tgfb <dig>  3′-utrs were covered by 1094bp and  <dig> bp fragments respectively. the hdac <dig> 3′-utr  was represented by a  <dig> bp pcr-fragment  and two additional  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp double-stranded oligonucleotides  covering single mirna binding sites. using oligonucleotides instead of longer 3′-utr fragments is well described in the literature . tob <dig>  dusp <dig>  smad <dig>  and smad <dig> 3′utrs were respectively represented by double-stranded oligonucleotides of  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp. in addition, an oligonucleotide pair with mutated seed sequences was used for tob <dig> 

pairs of pmirglo and pmirglo/3′-utr were cotransfected into hek293t cells with the appropriate mirna-mimic  to assess the activity of a specific mirna on a given 3′-utr. figures 2a and 2b depict renilla-normalized firefly activities measured from co-transfections of each mimic mir-10a, - <dig>  -26a, -26b, -29b, and − <dig> with pmirglo compared to co-transfections of these mimics with pmirglo/cdk6-1-3′-utr  and pmirglo/cdk6-2-3′-utr  respectively. the percentage reduction of relative firefly activities in pmirglo/3′-utr + mimic compared to activities of pmirglo + mimic transfections correlate with mirna activity on the given 3′-utr. here we identified strong interactions between cdk6- <dig> and mir-26a and mir-26b and moderate interactions with mir-29b. mir- <dig> and mir-29b interacted with fragment cdk6- <dig> 


figure  <dig> summarizes the results of experimental validations from all  <dig> predicted mirna-target interactions: cdk <dig> was targeted by mir- <dig>  mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b; ctnnbip <dig> was regulated by mir-10a and mir-29b; smad <dig> and tob <dig> were both recognized by mir-26a and mir-26b; and hdac <dig> was targeted by mir-29b. validations for dusp <dig>  smad <dig> and tgfb <dig> failed to give strongly positive results, with tgfb <dig> only weakly affected by mir-29b. detailed data for all experimental validation studies are presented in additional file  <dig>  in summary, we identified osteo-inhibitory targets for mir-10a, mir- <dig>  mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b with the highest targeting impact resulting from mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b expression.


target gene expression analysis and impact of regulating micrornas
as the availability of ussc lines sa5/ <dig> and sa8/ <dig> became limited in the course of our study, we focused on the newer ussc lines 86b and  <dig> for target gene expression analyses. using qpcr, we analyzed transcript expression of validated targets cdk <dig>  hdac <dig>  ctnnbip <dig>  smad <dig>  and tob <dig> during osteogenic differentiation of ussc line 86b at time points day  <dig> , and days  <dig> and  <dig> post dag induction. figure  <dig> demonstrates that cdk <dig>  hdac <dig>  smad <dig>  and ctnnbip <dig> were all steadily downregulated at days  <dig> and  <dig> compared to day  <dig>  hdac <dig> was downregulated at day  <dig>  followed by a slight increase in expression at day  <dig>  albeit weaker than at day  <dig>  we were unable to identify tob <dig> transcripts in ussc. these results indicate inverse transcriptional regulation of mirnas and target-mrnas inhibiting osteogenic differentiation of ussc.


as mirnas downregulate their targets on a posttranscriptional level, we also analyzed hdac <dig>  cdk <dig>  and smad <dig> protein expression during osteogenic differentiation  of ussc 86b and in response to ectopic expression of mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b in native ussc86b.

as seen in figure 5a, hdac <dig> was weakly expressed in native ussc 86b and downregulated by a factor  <dig> in day  <dig> osteo-differentiated ussc 86b, thereby matching our qpcr results . the hdac <dig> protein level was also reduced following transfection with mir-29b .


cdk <dig> behaved differently on the protein level; this protein was initially upregulated at day  <dig> of osteogenic differentiation in ussc 86b, and slightly downregulated at day  <dig> although still more abundant than in native cells . to further examine this unexpected result, we tested an additional ussc line , which yielded the same dynamic cdk <dig> expression pattern . upon independent transfection with  an equimolar mixture of mir-26a and mir-26b mimics  and  with mir-29b mimics, cdk <dig> protein abundance was reduced compared to native and negative control cells 48h after transfection . as with hdac <dig>  our results confirm that mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b target cdk <dig> 

interestingly, smad <dig> expression remained unchanged at day  <dig> post dag induction compared to native ussc 86b  and was not affected by transfection with mir-26a and mir-26b mimics . we were unable to detect the weakly transcribed ctnnbip <dig> with any of several established antibodies .

functional impact of mir-26a/b and mir-29b on osteogenic differentiation of ussc
our experimental target validations indicate that mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b likely have the strongest impact on osteogenic differentiation of ussc by reducing osteo-inhibitory cdk <dig> and hdac <dig> proteins. we thus tested whether overexpression of mir-26a/b and mir-29b using mirna mimics influences dag-induced osteogenic differentiation. ussc sa5/ <dig> and ussc 86b were each transfected with  a small unspecific negative control rna,  an equimolar batch of mir-26a and mir-26b,  mir-29b, and  an equimolar batch of mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b mimics , each followed by dag induction. osteogenic differentiation was assessed by alizarin-red staining and calcium release at day  <dig> .

as seen in figures 6a and 6b, both ussc lines started to differentiate at day  <dig> post dag induction. transfection of negative control rna did not substantially influence alizarin-red staining in both ussc sa5/ <dig>  and ussc 86b . in contrast, mir-26a/b-mimic transfected cells of both ussc lines showed significantly increased staining . transfection with mir-29b-mimic also resulted in accelerated osteogenic differentiation of both lines . transfection of ussc sa5/ <dig> with mir-26a/mir-26b/mir-29b mimics further increased differentiation .


the finding that mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b accelerated osteogenic differentiation of ussc was further supported by calcium release assays performed in dag-induced ussc sa5/ <dig> and 86b at days  <dig> and  <dig> of osteogenic differentiation. as seen in figures 7a and 7b, calcium release increased upon transfection with mir-26a/b and mir-29b as compared to negative-control transfected and untransfected ussc sa5/ <dig>  and ussc 86b . transfection of sa5/ <dig> with the mir-26a/mir-26b/mir-29b batch showed even higher calcium release, compared to mir-26a/mir-26b and mir-29b transfections alone .


discussion
ussc are primary cells from human cord blood and are available in limited amounts from different patient sources. in general, ussc cell lines, such as sa5/ <dig>  sa8/ <dig>  86b, and  <dig>  are capable of comparable osteogenic differentiation as assessed by alizarin-red staining . during osteogenic differentiation, only  <dig> mirnas were commonly upregulated in two ussc lines , although  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were respectively upregulated in each cell line. however, as expected for target-redundant mirna networks, evaluation of commonly upregulated mirnas revealed multiple bioinformatically osteo-inhibitory target genes.

mirna expression profiling followed by target validation indicated that mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b had the highest impact on osteogenic differentiation in our ussc lines. in the mouse osteoblast model, mir-29b is a positive regulator of osteogenic differentiation, able to increase differentiation on ectopic expression, with hdac <dig>  tgfb <dig>  acvr2a, ctnnbip <dig> and dusp <dig> as validated targets  <cit> . here we show a comparable function for mir-29b in osteogenic differentiation of human somatic stem cells confirming human ctnnbip <dig> and hdac <dig> as mir-29b targets in our hek293t-cell based validation assay. ctnnbip <dig> was also regulated by mir-10a and cdk <dig>  <cit>  was targeted by mir- <dig>  mir-26a, mir-26b and mir-29b.

mir-26a modulates late osteogenic differentiation of hadsc through smad <dig> targeting  <cit>  and we showed that both, mir-26a and mir-26b regulate smad <dig>  this protein is known as a positive mediator of osteogenic differentiation  <cit> . we also identified the osteo-inhibitory bmp/smad regulator tob <dig>  <cit>  as a target of mir-26a and mir-26b. substantial homology between these two mirnas  is reflected in their similar behavior in our target validation assays. to clarify the contradictory roles of osteo-promoting smad <dig> and osteo-inhibitory cdk <dig> and tob <dig> as parallel targets of mir-26a and mir-26b, we directly analyzed target protein abundance by quantitative western blotting  during osteogenic differentiation of ussc and  in response to transfection of ussc with mirna mimics.

despite targeting of the smad <dig> 3′-utr by mir-26a and mir-26b in our luciferase assay , smad <dig> protein abundance remained unaltered upon transfection with mir-26a/b mimics . this finding indicates either a long intracellular half-life for smad <dig> in ussc, unaltered by mirna transfection in the experimental timeframe, or secondary regulatory mechanisms such as increased transcription that keep smad <dig> levels constant. accordingly, smad <dig> protein levels also remained constant at day  <dig> in osteo-differentiated ussc 86b  as expected for an osteo-promoting protein. however, our qpcr data indicate that smad <dig> transcription decreased steadily from day  <dig> to day  <dig> and to day  <dig> of osteogenic differentiation , further supporting a long half-life for smad <dig> protein. due to strong calcification of ussc at day  <dig>  we were unable to measure smad <dig> protein and it remains unclear whether this protein has a long half-life or is regulated by other unidentified mechanisms.

in contrast to osteo-promoting smad <dig>  osteo-inhibitory cdk <dig> protein expression was indeed reduced 48h post transfection with mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b mimics. this finding indicates a comparatively strong regulatory influence of mir-26a/b and mir-29b on cdk <dig>  however, despite steady transcript downregulation, cdk <dig> protein expression peaked at day  <dig> of osteogenic differentiation, before decreasing. as mirnas act postranscriptionally  <cit> , the observed decrease of cdk <dig> abundance at day  <dig> was likely due to continued upregulation of mirnas targeting osteo-inhibitory factors beyond day  <dig>  after achieving sufficient levels to alter cdk <dig> protein abundance.

the hdac <dig> gene product was reduced on both transcript  and protein level  during osteogenic differentiation. similarly, the hdac <dig> protein level was reduced upon transfection with mir-29b mimic, consistent with our target validation assays. it should be noted that we were unable to detect either tob <dig> transcripts or tob <dig> and ctnnbip <dig> gene products in ussc .

using alizarin-red staining and calcium release assays, we clearly demonstrated that mir-26a/b and mir-29b mimic transfections specifically accelerate osteogenic differentiation in both ussc lines tested. this result is consistent with the observation that mir-29b contributes to osteogenic differentiation of mouse osteoblasts  <cit> . it should be noted that attempts to functionally analyze mir-10a and mir- <dig> failed due to a nearly complete loss of transfected ussc from the culture plates .

since mir-26a/b and mir-29b regulate osteo-inhibitory and osteo-promoting factors in parallel, the osteo-inhibitory effects of cdk <dig> and hdac <dig> likely outweigh the osteo-promoting effects of smad1; this finding is further supported by the unaltered abundance of smad <dig> in mir-26a/b transfected ussc.

the strongest effect on osteogenic differentiation was observed by transfecting an equimolar mixture of mir-26a, mir-26b, and mir-29b mimics. it is likely that mir-26a/b and mir-29b influence a common set of target genes with each mirna making additional contributions through targeting exclusive genes e.g. hdac <dig> and ctnnbip <dig>  which are regulated by mir-29b but not by mir-26a/b.

recently mir-135b was reported to be 100-fold upregulated in ussc following dag-induction  <cit> . in contrast, li and coworkers reported that mir-135b  were downregulated during mouse osteoblast differentiation after  <dig> hours  <cit> . in ussc, mir-133a and mir-133b as well as mir-135b are only weakly expressed even in native cells and virtually unchanged during osteogenic differentiation .

a recent study of mirna expression signatures asssociated with osteogenic commitment of ussc showed upregulation of similar mirnas  as determined in our analysis  <cit> . however the authors used ussc from a different source, employed different mirna expression analysis methodology , and focused on other mirnas, precluding direct comparison.

taken together, our results further establish the importance of mirnas in differentiation processes of ussc. we clearly demonstrated the combined functional impact of mir-26a/b and mir-29b, which had individually been identified as modulators of osteogenic differentiation in hadsc  <cit>  and mouse osteoblasts  <cit> . target gene similarities and differences between these mirnas imply that these mirnas act in a synergistic manner to improve and accelerate osteogenic differentiation of ussc.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we detected a subset of mirnas, notably mir-26a, mir-26b and mir-29b, which is consistently upregulated during osteogenic differentiation of ussc. we experimentally identified specific osteo-inhibitory proteins as regulatory targets for these mirnas in reporter gene analyses and in direct measurements of target protein abundance. functional analyses demonstrated that mir-26a, mir-26b and mir-29b positively modulate osteogenic differentiation of ussc, most likely by downregulating osteo-inhibitory target proteins. together with our previous studies on neuronal lineage differentiation  <cit> ,  <cit>  these findings further support the notion that differentiation of the unique somatic stem cell type ussc follows established biochemical pathways wherein mirnas are important regulatory molecules.
