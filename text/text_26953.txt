BACKGROUND
proteins are crucial for almost all of functions in the cell, including metabolic cycles, dna transcription and replication, and signalling cascades. usually, proteins rarely perform their functions alone; instead they cooperate with other proteins by forming a huge network of protein-protein interactions   <cit> . ppis are responsible for the majority of cellular functions. in the past decades, many innovative techniques for detecting ppis have been developed  <cit> . due to the progress in large-scale experimental technologies such as yeast two-hybrid  screens  <cit> , tandem affinity purification   <cit> , mass spectrometric protein complex identification   <cit>  and other high-throughput biological techniques for ppis detection, a large amount of ppis data for different species has been accumulated  <cit> . however, the experimental methods are costly and time consuming, therefore current ppi pairs obtained from experiments only covers a small fraction of the complete ppi networks  <cit> . in addition, large-scale experimental methods usually suffer from high rates of both false positive and false negative predictions  <cit> . hence, it is of great practical significance to develop the reliable computational methods to facilitate the identification of ppis  <cit> .

a number of computational methods have been proposed for the prediction of ppis based on different data types, including phylogenetic profiles, gene neighborhood, gene fusion, literature mining knowledge, and sequence conservation between interacting proteins  <cit> . there are also methods that combine interaction information from several different data sources  <cit> . however, these methods cannot be implemented if such pre-knowledge about the proteins is not available. recently, a couple of methods which derive information directly from amino acid sequence are of particular interest  <cit> . many researchers have engaged in the development of sequences-based method for discovering new ppis, and the experiment results showed that the information of amino acid sequences alone is sufficient to predict ppis <cit> . among them, one of the excellent works is a svm-based method developed by shen et al  <cit> . in the study, the  <dig> amino acids were clustered into seven classes according to their dipoles and volumes of the side chains, and then the conjoint triad method abstracts the features of protein pairs based on the classification of amino acids. when applied to predict human ppis, this method yields a high prediction accuracy of  <dig> %. because the conjoint triad method cannot takes neighboring effect into account and the interactions usually occur in the discontinuous amino acids segments in the sequence, on the other work guo et al. developed a method based on svm and auto covariance to extract the interactions information in the discontinuous amino acids segments in the sequence  <cit> . their method yielded a prediction accuracy of  <dig> %, when applied to predicting saccharomyces cerevisiae ppis. in our previous works, we also obtained good prediction performance by using autocorrelation descriptors and correlation coefficient, respectively  <cit> .

the general trend in current study for predicting ppis has focused on high accuracy but has not considered the time taken to train the classification models, which should be an important factor of developing a sequence-based method for predicting ppis because the total number of possible ppis is very large. therefore some computational models with high classification accuracy may not be satisfactory when considering the trade-off between the classification accuracy and the time for training the models. recently, huang et al. proposed a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine , which randomly assigns all the hidden node parameters of generalized single-hidden layer feed-forward networks  and analytically determines the output weights of slfns <cit> . previous works shown that elm provides efficient unified solutions to generalized feed-forward networks including kernel learning. consequently, elm offers significant advantages such as fast learning speed, ease of implementation, and least human intervention. elm has good potential as a viable alternative technique for large-scale computing and artificial intelligence. on the other hand, single elm model is sometime difficult to achieve a satisfactory performance for the complex processes with strong nonlinearity, time variant and highly uncertainty. ensemble elm methods have received special attentions because it can improve the accuracy of predictor and achieve better stability through training a set of models and then combining them for final predictions  <cit> . for example, lan et al. proposed an ensemble of online sequential elm with more stable and accurate results  <cit> . zhao et al. proposed an ensemble elm soft sensing model for effluent quality prediction based on kernel principal component analysis , whose reliability and accuracy outperforms other models  <cit> . in this study, an ensemble elm model was built to predict the protein interactions.

previous works have pointed out that using feature selection or feature extraction before conducting the classification tasks can improve the classification accuracy <cit> . here, we attempt to examine the effectiveness of the dimensionality reduction technique before constructing the elm classifier for the ppi prediction. principal component analysis  is utilized to do the feature extraction which projects the original feature space into a new space, on which the elm is used to perform the prediction task. the effectiveness of the proposed pca-elm is examined in terms of classification accuracy on the ppi dataset. promisingly, as can be seen that the developed pca-elm ppi prediction system has achieved high accuracy and runs very fast as well.

in this study, we report a new sequence-based method for the prediction of protein-protein interactions from amino acid sequences with ensemble elm and pca aiming at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the classification accuracy. firstly, four kinds of useful sequence-based features such as auto covariance , conjoint triad , local descriptor  and moran autocorrelation  are extracted from each protein sequence to mine the interaction information in the sequence. secondly, in order to reduce the computational complexity and enhance the overall accuracy of the predictor, an effective feature reduction method pca is employed to extract the most discriminative new feature subset. finally, elm is chosen as the weak learning machine and the ensemble elm classifier is constructed using the vectors of resulting feature subset as input. to evaluate the performance, the proposed method was applied to saccharomyces cerevisiae ppi data. the experiment results show that our method achieved 87% prediction accuracy with  <dig> % sensitivity at the precision of  <dig> %. the prediction model was also assessed using the independent dataset of the escherichia coli ppis and yielded  <dig> % prediction accuracy, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

RESULTS
in this section, we first discuss the biological datasets and evaluation strategies used in performance comparisons. next we present results for comparing the pca-eelm method to state-of-the-art classifier for predicting protein interaction pairs in yeast.

generation of the data set
we evaluated the proposed method with the dataset of physical protein interactions from yeast used in the study of guo et al.  <cit> . the ppi dataset was collected from saccharomyces cerevisiae core subset of database of interacting proteins , version dip  <dig>  after the redundant protein pairs which contain a protein with fewer than  <dig> residues or have ≥40% sequence identity were remove, the remaining  <dig> protein pairs comprise the final positive dataset. the  <dig> non-interacting protein pairs were generated from pairs of proteins whose sub-cellular localizations are different. the whole dataset consists of  <dig> protein pairs, where half are from the positive dataset and half are from the negative dataset.

evaluation measures
to measure the performance of the proposed method, we adopted 5-fold cross validation and four parameters, the overall prediction accuracy , sensitivity , precision  and matthews correlation coefficient . they are defined as follows:

  acc=tp+tntp+fp+tn+fn 

  sn=tptp+fn 

  pe=tptp+fp 

  mcc=tp×tn-fp×fn××× 

where true positive  is the number of true ppis that are predicted correctly; false negative  is the number of true ppis that are predicted to be non-interacting pairs; false positive  is the number of true non-interacting pairs that are predicted to be ppis, and true negative  is the number of true non-interacting pairs that are predicted correctly. mcc denotes mathews correlation coefficient.

experimental setting
the proposed pca-eelm protein interaction prediction method was implemented using matlab platform. for elm, the implementation by zhu and huang available from http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang was used. regarding svm, libsvm implementation available from http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm was utilized, which was originally developed by chang and lin. all the simulations were carried out on a computer with  <dig>  ghz 2-core cpu,  <dig> gb memory and windows operating system.

all elm in the ensemble classifier had the same number of hidden layer neurons but different random hidden layer weights and output layer weights. ensemble elm models were built via the stratified 5-fold cross-validation procedure through increasing gradually the number of hidden neurons from  <dig> to  <dig> in interval of  <dig>  the best number of neurons was adapted to create the training model. the sigmoid activation function was used to compute the hidden layer output matrix. the final model was an ensemble of  <dig> extreme learning machines, and the outputs of ensemble elm model were determined by combining the outputs of the each individual elm by majority voting. for svm, the radial basis function was chosen as the kernel function and the optimized parameters  were obtained with a grid search approach.

prediction performance of pca-eelm model
we evaluated the performance of the proposed pca-eelm model using the dip ppis data as investigated in guo et al.  <cit> . in order to evaluate the prediction ability of our elm classifiers, we also implemented a support vector machine  learning algorithm which is thought of as the state-of-the-art classifier. we have compared our ensemble elm based recognition scheme against methods utilizing svm with c =  <dig>  g =  <dig> , λ =  <dig>  for the ensemble elm and svm classifiers, all of the input values were normalized in the range of . to reduce the bias of training and testing data, a 5-fold cross-validation technique is adopted. more specifically, the dataset is divided into  <dig> subsets, and the holdout method is reiterated  <dig> times. each time four of the five subsets are put together as the training dataset, and the other one subset is utilized for testing the model. thus five models were generated for the five sets of data. table  <dig> demonstrates the average prediction performance of the pca-eelm and the pca-svm modelacross five runs.

it can be observed from table  <dig> that svm shows good prediction accuracy in the range of  <dig> %- <dig> %. for ensmble elm, high prediction accuracy in the range of  <dig> %- <dig> % is obtained. to better investigate the prediction ability of our model, we also calculated the values of sensitivity, precision, and mcc. from table  <dig>  we can see that our model gives good prediction performance with an average sens. value of  <dig> %, prec. value of  <dig> % and mcc value of  <dig> %. further, it can also be seen in the table  <dig> that the standard deviation of sensitivity, precision, accuracy and mcc are as low as  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the results illustrates that the pca-eelm is an accurate and efficient method for the prediction of ppis. to sum up, we can readily conclude that the pca-eelm approach generally outperforms the excellent pca-svm model with higher discrimination power for predicting ppis based the information of protein sequences.

in addition, it is evident from the results presented in table  <dig> that the average learning time of the pca-eelm classifier is  <dig>  seconds while the learning time of the svm model is  <dig>  seconds. the proposed ensemble elm classifier even run faster than the svm model. through these analyses, it is obvious that pca-eelm model is an efficient classification method in comparison with pca-svm method. therefore, we can see clearly that pca-eelm model is a much more appropriate method for predicting new protein interactions compared with the other methods. consequently, it makes us be more convinced that the proposed pca-eelm based method can be very helpful in assisting the biologist to assist in the design and validation of experimental studies and for the prediction of interaction partners. thus, in the case of real-time implementation of ppis prediction system, e-elm classifiers are more appropriate than svm model. all the analysis shows that our model is an accurate and fast method for the prediction of ppis.

comparing the prediction performance with other methods
in order to highlight the advantage of our model, it was also tested by helicobacter pylori dataset. the h. pylori dataset is composed of  <dig>  protein pairs  as described by martin et al  <cit> . this dataset gives a comparison of proposed method with other previous works including phylogenetic bootstrap <cit> , signature products <cit> , hknn <cit> , ensemble of hknn <cit>  and boosting <cit> . the results of  <dig> fold cross-validation over six different methods are shown in table  <dig>  the average prediction performance, i.e. sensitivity, precision, accuracy and mcc achieved by pca-eelm predictor, are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. it shows that the prediction results for pca-eelm predictor and the ensemble of hknn, outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which highlight that a multiple classifier system is more accurate and robust than a single classifier. we also observed that the proposed method clearly achieves better results compared to other multiple classifier systems . all these results show that the proposed pca-eelm classifier not only achieves accurate performance, but also substantially improves precision in the prediction of ppis.

CONCLUSIONS
