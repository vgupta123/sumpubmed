BACKGROUND
in the eukaryotic cell, the template for all dna metabolic activities including dna repair, replication, recombination and transcription, is chromatin. chromatin is a nucleoprotein complex in which approximately  <dig> base pairs of dna are wrapped around a histone core consisting of two each of the core histones h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig>  resulting in a repetitive structure called the nucleosome. linker histones of the h <dig> family bind to the linker dna regions connecting adjacent nucleosomes in the chromatin fiber. histones represent the major protein component of chromatin and most of the synthesis of the canonical forms takes place during s phase of the cell cycle to allow for efficient packaging of the newly replicated dna. in contrast, a subset of histone variants is synthesized throughout the cell cycle and can replace canonical histones to specify chromatin domains for specific functions  <cit> . histone h2a.z is one such replacement histone variant and while it is very widely studied, its structural and functional roles have not only proven to be many and diverse but also controversial  <cit> .

from a functional perspective, histone h2a.z has been found to be present in heterochromatin, where it participates in the formation of pericentric and centric chromatin,  <cit>  and in euchromatin  <cit> , where it is usually found associated with promoters of active genes  <cit> . recent work has revealed that promoters are marked by complexes that contain h2a.z in conjunction with the h <dig>  variant indicating that replication-independent histone variant replacement plays a role in generating an appropriate chromatin landscape at these loci  <cit> . the concept that h2a.z serves to poise promoters for transcriptional activation but is displaced from chromatin once transcription is initiated has been widely documented  <cit> .

recently, another very interesting function has been ascribed to h2a.z, which is that it aids in localizing genes to the nuclear periphery and in doing so marks them for more rapid reactivation even after several cell divisions  <cit> . many of these functions of h2a.z, although seemingly very different, may not be entirely unrelated in a broad sense if h2a.z is considered a mark that is required to specify the nuclear location of a given region of the genome perhaps with respect to the nuclear periphery, or the nuclear matrix in general.

at the structural level, h2a.z has been shown to enhance the stability of the nucleosome  <cit>  despite the fact that the h2a.z-h2b dimer exhibits a reduced stability compared to h2a-h2b dimers  <cit> . h2a.z has also been shown to alter nucleosome mobility  <cit> . when present in nucleosome arrays, h2a.z increases the intramolecular interactions and promotes hp1Î±-mediated folding of the fiber  <cit> . furthermore, several well-positioned h2a.z-containing nucleosomes flank sites occupied by the insulator binding protein ctcf which prevents the spread of heterochromatin  <cit> .

how h2a.z is able to participate in these many cellular events could be based on whether it is placed within isolated nucleosomes or within contiguous stretches of chromatin, as is the case at many polycomb group genes in embryonic stem cells  <cit> . alternatively, post translational modifications shown to exist on h2a.z, including acetylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation, may direct certain populations of h2a.z for a specific function.

recently, we identified the presence of two h2a.z protein isoforms in chicken that differ by  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . our group has also provided evidence of distinct phylogenetic patterns for the h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> variants during vertebrate evolution  <cit> . importantly, h2a.z is the only histone variant that has been shown to be indispensable for survival in drosophila  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . however, in this latter study, only h2a.z- <dig> was knocked out. this indicates that h2a.z- <dig> is incapable of compensating for the loss of h2a.z- <dig> in mice. whether this is because of lower amounts of total h2a.z or because of differences in the nuclear localization, post translational modification, biochemical interactions or temporal expression of the h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> genes is unknown. in the present work, we show that both isoforms are expressed across a wide range of human tissues and that they display a similar nuclear distribution and levels of n-terminal acetylation. furthermore, we show that the distribution of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> within chromatin differs, as does their association with histone h <dig> trimethylated at lysine  <dig>  despite the high degree of amino acid sequence similarity between these h2a.z isoforms, they display very divergent promoter sequences that could result in temporal and tissue-specific differences in gene expression.

RESULTS
the n-terminal tails of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> are acetylated in vivo in chicken cells
we employed a mass spectrometric approach in order to determine if the n-terminal tail of h2a.z- <dig> is acetylated in vivo in a similar way to the recently described acetylation of the same region in h2a.z- <dig>  <cit> . total h2a.z protein was purified from chicken erythrocytes and sodium butyrate-treated msb cells by a combination of gel filtration chromatography and rp-hplc. purified h2a.z was then derivatized with propionic anhydride to limit trypsin digestion to arginine residues as previously described  <cit> . the h2a.z peptides were next analysed by lc-coupled tandem mass spectrometry which enabled sequence determination of the first  <dig> residues of both h2a.z- <dig>  and h2a.z- <dig> . this technique also afforded the identification of multiple acetylation sites on both of the n-terminal peptides from the sodium butyrate-treated sample. figure 1a and 1b illustrate the mass spectrometry  spectra of the most abundant form of the n-terminal peptide identified in the sodium butyrate-treated sample which was a triply-acetylated form with acetylation present on k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig>  in fact, four different forms of the h2a.z- <dig> n-terminal peptide were detected, similar to those previously described for h2a.z- <dig>  <cit> . selected ion chromatograms, shown in figure 1c, illustrate the presence and abundance of the unmodified, singly-acetylated, doubly-acetylated and triply-acetylated peptides from both h2a.z isoforms. albeit at lower relative abundance, doubly-acetylated species were also enriched in this sample and include forms concurrently acetylated at k <dig> + k <dig>  k <dig> + k <dig> and k <dig> + k <dig> for both isoforms. singly-acetylated species were also detected but were present at significantly lower abundance and, as a consequence, the acetylation sites were not able to be determined for these forms. however, it is likely that they are very similar to those previously determined for h2a.z- <dig>  since all other modified forms are also very similar for both isoforms.

h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> are mainly distributed in euchromatin in mouse fibroblasts and in hek  <dig> cells
in order to determine the pattern of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> distribution within chromatin, asynchronous mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with yfp-h2a.z- <dig> and cfp-h2a.z- <dig> and imaged live . figure  <dig> indicates that yfp-h2a.z- <dig>  and cfp-h2a.z- <dig>  have a near identical distribution throughout chromatin. the composite image showing hoechst dna staining  and yfp-h2a.z- <dig>  indicates h2a.z- <dig> is preferentially located within regions of euchromatin . however, since both variants localize to the same regions, it stands that h2a.z- <dig> would also be mainly present in euchromatic regions. both variants, however, are also present within the dna-dense chromocenters, as shown by their yellow staining in the composite image. to ensure that the transfected proteins were able to be incorporated into nucleosomes, chromatin from these cells was isolated, digested with microccocal nuclease and separated on sucrose gradients in order to obtain mononucleosomes  <cit> . western blot analysis of these mononucleosomes with an anti-gfp antibody confirmed the incorporation of the transfected h2a.z variants .

in order to analyse the distribution of h2a.z variants within chromatin biochemically, c-terminal flag epitope tagged h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> were stably transfected into hek  <dig> cells, nuclei were isolated and digested with microccocal nuclease and the chromatin was separated into s <dig>  se and pellet fractions. the stably transfected clones that were selected had nearly identical expression levels of the respective flag-tagged h2a.z that represented less than 30% of the total endogenous h2a.z . the highly nuclease-accessible and low salt soluble s <dig> fraction contains mainly mononucleosomes having a dna length of approximately  <dig> bp that generally represents active chromatin, while the more nuclease-resistant se fraction contains mainly repressed chromatin with dna of varying lengths   <cit> . the insoluble pellet fraction most likely represents a mixture of transcriptionally active and repressed chromatin that is insoluble due to its association with large protein complexes such as the rna pol ii and chromatin remodelling complexes or components of the nuclear matrix   <cit> . this fraction contains far fewer histones compared to other high molecular weight proteins. western blot analysis of the histones extracted from these fractions, using an antibody against h2a.z that does not discriminate between the variants, indicates that total endogenous h2a.z  is present in all three chromatin fractions but is more abundant in the s <dig> and se compared to the p . this antibody is also able to detect the flag-tagged h2a.z proteins  and indicates that, although these forms fractionate similarly to the endogenous forms, the h2a.z-2-flag protein is present in higher amounts in the s <dig> fraction. this pattern can also be seen when the blot is probed with an anti-flag antibody . these blots were further probed with an antibody against total h <dig> as a loading control and against h <dig> trimethylated at lysine  <dig> . staining with the latter antibody indicates that this modification does not partition equally among the fractions, but is proportionally more abundant within the pellet fraction. since h <dig> tri-me k <dig> is a marker of promoter regions of active genes, this result is in agreement with the notion that the pellet fraction contains genomic regions that are actively being transcribed.

h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> associate with different forms of post-translationally modified h <dig> and h <dig> within the nucleosome
we next sought to determine if the h2a.z variants differentially associate with several post-translationally modified forms of other histones within the nucleosome. following the protocol of sarcinella and colleagues  <cit> , c-terminal flag-tagged versions of h2a.z- <dig>  h2a.z- <dig> and h2a as a control were transiently expressed in hela cells and the chromatin was digested to mononucleosomes using micrococal nuclease. each preparation of mononucleosomes was analysed on native acrylamide gels in order to ensure complete digestion of the chromatin . the nucleosomes containing the flag-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-flag agarose beads and the specificity of the immunoprecipitations was monitored by aut-page . figure 4a shows that the immunoprecipitations are specific for h2a-flag, h2a.z-2-flag or h2a.z-1-flag containing nucleosomes. the identity of these histones was further confirmed by two-dimensional page with an acid-urea-triton  gel in the first dimension followed by a sodium dodecyl sulphate  gel in the second dimension . figure 4a also indicates that a proportion of both the h2a.z-1-flag and h2a.z-2-flag nucleosomes only contain one copy of the tagged protein in the histone octamer, as an h2a band with equal staining intensity is also present in the gel. in order to confirm this result, sds-page followed by a western blot using an anti-h2a antibody was performed on the histones from the immunoprecipitated mononucleosomes and is shown in the bottom panels of figure 4a. bands corresponding to h2a are present in all three normalized mononucleosome preparations but with a higher intensity in the h2a.z-2-flag and h2a.z-1-flag nucleosomes . the presence of these heterotypic h2a.z nucleosomes has been previously documented in hela cells by mass spectrometry  <cit> . the histones of the immunoprecipitated nucleosomes that were normalized with respect to total h <dig> were resolved by sds-page and transferred to membranes which were probed with antibodies specific for several post-translationally modified forms of histones . both forms of h2a.z nucleosomes are enriched in h <dig> trimethylated at lysine  <dig> compared to h2a nucleosomes as shown by other groups   <cit> . however, this enrichment is greater in the case of the h2a.z-2-flag nucleosomes than in the h2a.z-1-flag nucleosomes. the promoters of most protein coding genes contain nucleosomes that have the h <dig> tri-me k <dig> mark along with h <dig> acetylated at k <dig> and k <dig>  <cit> . when the immunoprecipitated nucleosomes were probed with an antibody against this latter h <dig> modification, roughly equal amounts can be seen in the h2a-flag, h2a.z-2-flag and h2a.z-1-flag nucleosomes . h <dig> trimethylated at lysine  <dig> is a marker of inactive promoters and mediates transcriptional silencing  <cit> . the levels of this modification are relatively equal among all the flag immunoprecipitated nucleosomes . similarly, the levels of h <dig> acetylated at lysine  <dig> are equal among nucleosomes. interestingly, h2a.z-1-flag and h2a.z-2-flag nucleosomes are enriched in h <dig> phosphorylated at serine  <dig> compared to h2a-flag nucleosomes. this pattern was also seen when the transfected cells were arrested in mitosis by nocodazole treatment before generation of mononucleosomes and immunoprecipitation. it is possible that the majority of the h3phoss <dig> staining in the asynchronous cells could be due to the proportion of mitotic cells within that population. this is probably the case, since the staining intensity is increased in mitotic h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> nucleosomes.

h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> are differentially expressed among tissues
in order to compare the levels of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> mrna expression in different tissues and in hela cells, we performed quantitative polymerase reaction  on a panel of adult and fetal human tissue samples. primers were designed that specifically amplify the cdna of either h2a.z isoform based on substantial sequence differences within the untranslated regions . the specificity of the pcr reaction was monitored by dna sequencing of the amplicons and by melting curve analysis. the highest levels of h2a.z transcripts were seen in hela cells and in the testes . figure  <dig> also shows that the levels of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> transcript expression were similar in several adult tissues, including testes, ovary, prostate, peripheral blood leukocytes, small intestine, pancreas and hela cells. the adult brain showed approximately four times more h2a.z- <dig> transcript than h2a.z- <dig>  a twofold increase in h2a.z- <dig> transcript levels over h2a.z- <dig> was seen in the adult liver and kidney. the widest range of expression levels between tissues for each variant was fivefold  for h2a.z- <dig> and fivefold  for h2a.z- <dig>  in order to determine if the expression levels of the h2a.z variants differed depending on developmental stage, we also analysed their expression in three fetal tissues for which there was an adult counterpart. when comparing the fetal h2a.z variant transcript levels with one another, h2a.z- <dig> was more abundant than h2a.z- <dig> in the brain  and they had similar levels in the fetal liver and kidney . while the fetal kidney showed a similar h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> expression pattern compared to adult kidney , the patterns observed in brain and liver were different between fetus and adult suggesting possible developmental regulation of transcript levels .

the promoter sequences of the h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> genes are substantially different
the evolutionary process responsible for the differentiation between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> has been described as a refined stepwise mutation change within the codons of the three differential residues , leading to differences in the intensity of the selective constraints acting upon the two h2a.z isoforms in vertebrates  <cit> . in order to determine whether the variation in expression patterns of the h2a.z variants could be attributed in part to differences in transcription factor binding sites in the promoters and, therefore, potential differential gene regulation, we dissected the proximal promoter regions of both h2a.z variants in mammals , where the evolutionary differentiation between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> has reached its maximum. recurrent search rounds for transcription regulatory elements were performed on h2a.z promoter regions from human, rhesus monkey and mouse, leading to the identification of several putative promoter elements as well as to the localization of previously studied modules shown to be critical for h2a.z- <dig> promoter activity  <cit> . however, comparisons between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> promoter regions revealed completely different promoter architectures . h2a.z- <dig> shows the presence of typical elements common to other replication-independent histone variants as well as putative binding sites for other transcription factors. a perfect tata box, three caat boxes and several putative gc-boxes  are observed in the proximal promoter region. among these elements, one caat box  and a gc-box  are critical for h2a.z promoter activity  <cit> . furthermore, binding sites for c-myc are present within the upstream region of the h2a.z- <dig> promoter  where they have been shown to specifically bind myc and increase h2a.z- <dig> transcription in response to estrogen  <cit> .

the characterization of the h2a.z- <dig> promoter emphasizes the existence of a clear differentiation between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig>  the h2a.z- <dig> promoter contains no tata box and the positions of the caat elements and gc-boxes do not coincide with those identified in h2a.z- <dig> . furthermore, it seems that h2a.z- <dig> promoters show a lesser degree of conservation across the mammalian species studied, as indicated by the lack of the positional consensus in the elements identified . searches for potential regulatory elements in the proximal promoter region resulted in the identification of three caat elements as well as several binding sites for transcription factors including c-myc and n-myc. however, the positioning of these latter binding sites at the proximal region suggests that they may function in constitutive gene expression rather than in inducible regulation in response to agents such as hormones  <cit> .

the differentiation between the h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> promoters has also been analysed from a phylogenetic perspective . our results reveal the differentiation of two major evolutionary lineages based on h2a.z promoter sequences, one encompassing the h2a.z- <dig> promoter sequences and the other including h2a.z- <dig> promoter sequences . such topology is in agreement with the phylogenetic inferences reconstructed on the basis of h2a.z protein sequences and nucleotide coding regions, which also show an evolutionary differentiation between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> variants. the presence of such differentiation at promoter regions strongly supports the presence of evolutionary constraints which act with different direction and intensity on the h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> proteins.

discussion
h2a.z is the most extensively studied histone variant and it has been shown to be involved in several seemingly unrelated and divergent processes. understanding how this protein participates in different cellular events has undoubtedly been further complicated by the use of different biological systems, since, while certain general functions of h2a.z may be universal in all organisms, the specific details and fine-tuning in higher eukaryotes may not be present, or may be the work of other proteins, in yeast or flies. part of this fine-tuning of h2a.z in vertebrates could be due to the co-existence in the cell of two h2a.z protein isoforms  that was first determined by mass spectrometry in total h2a.z isolated from chicken erythrocytes  <cit> . an evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis of these isoforms revealed a substantial conservation at the protein level where they differ by only three amino acids , but a marked divergence at the nucleotide sequence level  <cit> . it also revealed that the two h2a.z isoforms had a common origin early in deuterostome evolution that was followed by a subsequent process of differentiation  <cit> . indeed, it appears that the strength of the evolutionary constraints operating at the nucleotide level are not equal between the isoforms, with h2a.z- <dig> being significantly more constrained than h2a.z- <dig>  <cit> . cumulatively, the evolutionary evidence points toward a possible functional diversification of these two proteins.

recently, our group has characterized the sites of acetylation within the n-terminus of h2a.z- <dig> from chicken erythrocytes and from chicken erythroleukemic  cells treated with sodium butyrate to inhibit histone deacetylases  <cit> . notably in the chicken, h2a.z- <dig> is the variant that has traditionally been called h2a.z or h2a.f/z. in mouse and human h2a.z- <dig> has customarily been considered h2a.z, while h2a.z- <dig> was previously known as h2a.v/f. in the current work, we determined that h2a.z- <dig> is acetylated at at least three lysine residues within the n-terminus, as is h2a.z- <dig>  the patterns of acetylation are similar for both isoforms, where a triply-acetylated  form as well as doubly-acetylated  forms of the n-terminal peptides were identified within the sample. singly-acetylated n-terminal peptides were also detected. however, the sites of acetylation were not able to be determined owing to the low abundances of these species. in a previous study, we identified multiple singly-acetylated h2a.z- <dig> peptides, with the abundance of acetyl k4-containing species being relatively equal to the acetyl k <dig> species  <cit> , and this is likely to be the case with the singly-acetylated forms of h2a.z- <dig>  previously, h2a.z- <dig> has been shown to be monoubiquitinated at one of several lysine residues within the c-terminus, as well as sumoylated. however, neither modification was observed on either h2a.z variant in chicken cells, although this could be a result of the purification method used here, or the cell type  <cit> .

our results regarding the nuclear localization of the h2a.z isoforms indicate that they are identically distributed mainly in the euchromatin of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, as seen by other groups  <cit> . however, both h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> staining are also present within dna-dense regions that represent the centres of chromosomes. this is most probably due to the known presence of h2a.z in pericentric and centric chromatin  <cit> . this distribution of h2a.z is corroborated by our biochemical analysis of chromatin fractions indicating that endogenous h2a.z is present in greater amounts within the s <dig>  and se  fractions compared to the pellet . in accordance with the distribution of endogenous h2a.z within these fractions, we see that both stably transfected h2a.z-1-flag and h2a.z-2-flag are also present in all fractions. however, interestingly, h2a.z-2-flag protein is present in greater amounts within the s <dig> fraction compared to h2a.z-1-flag. this suggests that h2a.z- <dig> may play a greater role in the function of h2a.z within the nuclease accessible euchromatin than does h2a.z- <dig>  several systems have shown that h2a.z functions in part to poise promoter chromatin for transcriptional activation, since it is remodelled from promoters of actively transcribing genes  <cit> . h2a.z functioning in this manner would probably fractionate within the s <dig> fraction, since this chromatin would be in a more open conformation. furthermore, the low levels of h2a.z present within the p fraction also agree with its not playing a significant role after the initiation stage of transcription. therefore, in hek  <dig> cells h2a.z- <dig> may be playing a greater role than h2a.z- <dig> in poising chromatin for transcription, which agrees with our results indicating that h2a.z- <dig> also shows a greater association with h <dig> tri-me k <dig> than h2a.z- <dig> .

genome-wide distribution patterns indicate that h <dig> tri-me k <dig> and h2a.z are both present at the promoters and 5' ends of genes in yeast and humans  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising that h2a.z and h <dig> tri-me k <dig> are present within the same nucleosome  <cit> . the fact that h2a.z- <dig> associates with h <dig> tri-me k <dig> to a greater extent than h2a.z- <dig> is interesting because it indicates that there is a greater overlap in the regions of chromatin where h2a.z- <dig> is incorporated in conjunction with the h <dig> tri-me k <dig> mark than h2a.z- <dig>  this reinforces the idea that h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> could be incorporated at different locations within the genome. the remodelling of h2a.z into chromatin in mammals is known to occur via the action of several distinct complexes that contain the srcap protein, p <dig> or tip 48/ <dig> as the adenosine triphosphate-dependent remodelling subunits and evidence suggests that the deposition patterns of these complexes may differ  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that one complex may prefer a specific isoform over the other, or that one complex may be responsible for incorporating h2a.z at low levels across the genome and another for the increased levels of h2a.z that are necessary to promote appropriate chromatin architecture at promoters  <cit> . furthermore, h2a.z nucleosomes flank nucleosome free regions whose formation is dna-sequence dependent in several organisms including humans  <cit> . whether one of the human complexes that integrates h2a.z into chromatin contains a subunit that recognizes a specific dna sequence is unclear but points to the potential for more than one mechanism to specify the location of h2a.z nucleosomes  <cit> . indeed, a recent in silico analysis suggests that both genetic and epigenetic factors can predict whether a nucleosome will contain h2a.z  <cit> .

the functional output of the increased association of h2a.z- <dig> with h <dig> tri-me k <dig> is unclear, but it is highly unlikely that it results in a structural alteration of the nucleosome that would otherwise not be observed in those containing h2a.z- <dig> with h <dig> tri-me k <dig> given the high sequence similarity of the isoforms. at least one of the effects of having h2a.z and h <dig> tri-me k <dig> within the same nucleosome could be related to the recruitment or function of the rna pol ii complex, since both the c-terminal region of h2a.z and h <dig> tri-me k <dig> have been shown to interact with components of this complex  <cit> . another possibility is that nucleosomes containing both h2a.z and the h <dig> tri-me k <dig> mark protect less dna than other nucleosomes, making the dna more accessible for transcription  <cit> . nevertheless, it is possible that any differences in the genomic localization and association with post translationally modified forms of other histones of the endogenous h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> could reflect spatial and temporal differences in their nuclear availability as determined by their levels of expression, or by their import into the nucleus.

our results also reveal that h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> nucleosomes are enriched in h <dig> phosphorylated at s <dig> compared to h2a nucleosomes in asynchronous and mitotic hela. this association is interesting because like h2a.z, h <dig> phoss <dig> has been shown to be involved in processes requiring open and condensed chromatin, namely in transcription and chromosome condensation during mitosis  <cit> . the structural and functional consequences of h3s <dig> phosphorylation are not entirely clear; however, this modification does correlate with increased expression of immediate early genes after induction of map kinase cascades  <cit> . furthermore, it is not surprising that h4ack <dig> is found to associate with h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> nucleosomes because it has been shown that this modification of h <dig> is required for incorporation of h2a.z into subtelomeric chromatin in budding yeast  <cit> .

our analysis of the transcript levels of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> indicate that there is no one dominant form, rather they are both expressed across a wide range of human tissues and that the expression levels vary depending on developmental stage. this pattern of expression probably reflects the significant sequence variation within the promoter regions of these genes and the differences in abundance of specific transcription factors within the tissues. however, it could also reflect subtle changes in the requirements of the tissues for one isoform over the other, based on any functional differences between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig>  indeed, it has recently been shown that h2a.z- <dig> is specifically upregulated during macrophage differentiation and activation  <cit>  and our analysis of the promoter of h2a.z- <dig> indicates the presence of putative binding sites for the ikaros transcription factor which is known to play a role in hematopoietic cell development  <cit> . also as previously mentioned, genetic knockout studies in mice show that h2a.z- <dig> is essential for development, indicating that h2a.z- <dig> cannot compensate for the loss of h2a.z- <dig> at least at early stages of mouse embryo differentiation  <cit> .

the evolutionary evidence presented here suggests that it is highly possible that h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> appeared in vertebrates as a result of the entire genome duplication that took place between the divergence of the prochordates from the ancestral chordate lineage and the evolution of vertebrates, as stated by the 2r hypothesis  <cit> . while most of the genes arising from this duplication event were silenced, some of them were retained and their protein products either acquired a neofunctionalization  or a subfunctionalization in which the two new proteins acquired specialized functions  <cit> . this latter situation appears to be the case in going from h2a.z-e to h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> in vertebrates.

CONCLUSIONS
we present evidence that the two forms of h2a.z present in mammals display similar genomic localization patterns mainly within euchromatin but that subtle differences in their association with post translationally modified forms of other histones exist. thus, it is possible that throughout the course of vertebrate evolution, the two h2a.z isoforms have acquired a degree of independent function that may contribute to the increased complexity and large diversity of roles for this histone variant in higher organisms. it is also possible that differences in chromatin localization patterns of the isoforms could be due to the temporal regulation of their genes, especially considering the dissimilarity in the promoter regions.
