BACKGROUND
the epidemic of severe atypical pneumonia, designated "severe acute respiratory syndrome " by the world health organization  and first observed in guangdong province of china in november  <dig>  affected  <dig> people and caused  <dig> deaths in  <dig> countries and areas worldwide up to august  <dig>   <dig>  <cit> . a novel coronavirus, sars-associated coronavirus , was confirmed as the pathogen  <cit> . in the absence of effective drugs, controlling this disease relies on the rapid identification of cases and appropriate management of the close contacts, or effective vaccines against sars. therefore, the development of both specific and sensitive laboratory tests for sars as well as effective vaccines is necessary for national authorities.

laboratory tests for sars based on indirect immunofluorescence assay  or viral particle lysate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  to detect antibodies against sarscov are important methods  <cit> . however, these methods both require cultivation of sarscov in a biosafety level  <dig> or  <dig> laboratory, which is both dangerous and difficult. finding a suitable diagnostic test for this virus therefore remains a high priority. a practical approach towards this goal is to clone and express the immunodominant genes of sarscov.

several studies have shown that most of the antigenic epitopes of sarscov are located on the nucleocapsid  and spike  proteins and that the latter protein has an important role in viral entry and pathogenesis  <cit> . other data have shown that the viral n and s proteins of coronaviruses could induce a specific t cell response  <cit> . here, we report the cloning and expression of a truncated s-n fusion protein of sarscov and the investigation of its antigenicity and immunogenicity.

RESULTS
serological cross-reactivity among coronaviruses and recombinant proteins
the result of immunofluorescence analysis of cross-reactivity between sarscov-infected cells and mouse antisera against each n protein of the three coronaviruses is shown in figure  <dig>  the results show that mouse anti-sera to hcov229e n protein and hcovoc <dig> n protein cross-react with sarscov. figure  <dig> shows the result of immunoblot analyses for cross-reactions between  intact n protein from the three human coronaviruses plus the truncated s protein and mouse antisera against each coronavirus  and  truncated n protein from each coronavirus and mouse antisera against each coronavirus . the results showed  cross-reactions between the intact n proteins and the antisera against the three coronaviruses and  no cross-reaction between the antisera and the truncated proteins. the recombinant proteins of hcov229e and hcovoc <dig> were also tested with  <dig> serum samples from sars convalescents by elisa. the results showed  <dig> and  <dig> sera were tested positive by n proteins of hcovoc <dig> and hcov229e respectively, while none of the sera were tested positive by both truncated n proteins of hcovoc <dig> and hcov229e.

diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of elisa with truncated s-n fusion protein as antigen
the qualities of truncated s protein, n protein, truncated n protein and truncated s-n fusion protein as diagnostic antigens were evaluated by elisa technique as described in materials and methods. all  <dig> sars patients' sera were tested against all four antigens. only  <dig> samples were tested negative in the truncated s-n fusion protein assay, whereas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> samples were tested negative in the truncated s protein, n protein and truncated n protein assays, respectively . compared with sarscov lysate elisa, the sensitivity of elisa with truncated s protein, n protein, truncated n protein and truncated s-n fusion protein as antigens were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and > 99% , respectively. to evaluate the specificity of these assays, the sera of the  <dig> healthy people were tested. only a few gave a positive reaction with either sarscov lysate or n protein, whereas none reacted against the truncated proteins . to further evaluate the specificity of the truncated s-n fusion protein, the polyclonal mouse sera against sarscov , hcov229e and hcovoc <dig> antisera to were tested by elisa. only mice antiserum against sarscov tests positive.

specific humoral and cellular anti- sarscov immune responses to the truncated s-n fusion protein
sera antibody tests showed the ability of the fusion protein to induce the generation of sars-specific antibodies in the immunized mice. nine to twelve days after injection, the specific ig g antibody could be detected. to test whether the mouse sera against the truncated s-n protein were able to neutralize sarscov, a property that is likely to be crucial in the defense against virus infection, the sarscov bj <dig> strain was used in a microneutralization assay as described in materials and methods. the serum titer of neutralizing antibodies against sarscov was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  

the lymphocytes proliferation assay showed that the truncated s-n protein could induce t cell proliferation of mice immunized with the truncated fusion protein . there are significant differences between mice immunized with the truncated fusion protein and the controls .

a four balb/c mice of each group were killed. spleens were harvested and lymphocyte cultures  were stimulated in vitro for  <dig> days with medium or with various concentrations of purified recombinant fusion truncated s-n protein . the truncated s-n protein could induce t cell proliferation and significant differences were found between the groups of mice immunized with recombinant protein or injected with pbs .

discussion
sars, a newly emerged infectious disease which caused worldwide outbreak in  <dig>  has been a crucial public health problem. establishing specific and convenient laboratory tests for sars and finding a vaccine for this virus are of high priority.

previous data have shown a high degree of sequence similarity between the nucleocapsid  proteins of coronaviruses and demonstrated serious serological cross-reactions  <cit> . we aligned the n protein of five human coronaviruses  and found several fairly homologous regions, e.g. sarscov 57-210aa, 258-320aa. in these regions, the n protein of sarscov is 35–39% identical in amino acid sequence to the n protein of hcov 229e and hcov nl <dig> and 47–50% identical in amino acid sequence to that of hcovoc <dig> and hcovhku <dig> . we also found that the c-terminal of the n protein  has lower identity in amino acid sequence among these human coronaviruse . in addition, our previous research showed that some unique highly antigenic sites are located in the c-terminal part of the sars n protein and in the 270-667aa of the sars spike  protein  <cit> . other research also showed that the c-terminal part of the sars n protein was highly antigenic  <cit> . in the present study, using the pqe <dig> expression vector we cloned the n genes, gene segments encoding the c-terminal parts of the n proteins from all three coronaviruses, as well as sarscov gene segments encoding a truncated spike protein  and a truncated s-n fusion protein, respectively. all proteins were highly expressed in e. coli m <dig>  to evaluate the cross-reactivity of these recombinant proteins and viruses, ifa and immunoblot assays were performed. the results  showed that the truncated proteins only reacted with species-specific antiserum while the n proteins cross-reacted as did the viruses. the further elisa results also showed that the intact n proteins of hcov229e and hcovoc <dig> cross-reacted with sars patients' sera  while the truncated n proteins did not cross-react with sars patients' sera.

using the purified proteins as antigens in elisa assays for antibodies in the sera of sars patients we found that the assay using truncated s-n fusion protein has a clearly higher sensitivity than those using intact n protein or truncated s and n proteins, and virtually as high as the assay using whole sarscov lysate . the results indicated the n and s protein were complementary in detecting sars-specific antibodies. this is consistent with previous studies  <cit> . five positive sera to sarscov lysate antigen were all tested positive against sarscov n protein but negative against sarscov truncated n-s protein. these sera were also tested positive against n proteins of hcov229e and hcovoc <dig> , which could be reasonably explained partly by existence of other hcov infections in these humans. the truncated s-n fusion protein was also subjected to elisa with mice antisera against sarscov , hcov229e and hcovoc <dig>  only mice antiserum against sarscov tests positive. these results showed that the sarscov truncated n-s protein had high specificity. considering the difficulty of sarscov lysate antigen production and its false positive ratio , the truncated s-n fusion protein is a suitable diagnostic antigen for detection of sarscov antibodies.

the s protein of sarscov is an important determinant of tissue tropism, as it mediates virus and cellular membrane fusion. analysis of neutralizing epitopes showed that the receptor-binding region of the s protein plays an important role in virus infection  <cit> . a dna vaccine study of sarscov has also shown that the s protein can induce protective immune responses to sarscov  <cit> . moreover, some data showed that the n protein of sarscov could induce specific t-cell responses and studies of animal coronaviruses have suggested that both cellular and humoral immunity contribute to protection during persistent infection  <cit> . considering that our fusion protein includes the receptor-binding region of the s protein and immunodominant t-cell epitopes of the n protein, we also investigated the role of the truncated s-n protein in anti-sarscov infection. seven to nine days after injection of the fusion protein, the mice began to show seropositive for sars antibodies. after the first booster, all mice generated high titer of sars-specific antibodies and the antibodies could neutralize the sarscov infectivity. in the lymphocytes proliferation assay, the truncated s-n protein could induce t cell proliferation . compared to the control group, the mice immunized with the truncated s-n protein were protected from sarscov challenge, as indicated by a lack of detectable viral rna. therefore, in addition to being a valuable diagnostic antigen the truncated s-n fusion protein is a potential candidate for the development of a sars subunit vaccine.

CONCLUSIONS
the truncated s-n fusion protein has high sensitivity and specificity and it is a suitable diagnostic antigen for detection of sarscov antibodies. on the other hand, it could induce the mice generated high titer of sars-specific neutralizing antibodies and t cell proliferation. the mice immunized with the truncated s-n protein were protected from sarscov challenge. it is also a potential candidate for the development of a sars subunit vaccine.
