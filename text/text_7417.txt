BACKGROUND
the epigenome includes dna methylation , post-translational histone modifications and chromatin remodeling. tens of millions of nucleotides referred to as cpg sites, which are prone to dnamet, exist in the haploid human genome. furthermore, the genome-wide dnamet profile is maintained through cell divisions. dna methyltransferases apply methyl groups on cpg sites to form 5-methylcytosine, whereas demethylation may occur either passively due to dysfunction of the transferring enzyme or actively through 5-hydromethylcytosine formation. genomic regions spanning approximately  <dig>  kilobases with a high density of cpg sites are called cpg islands, and these are commonly localized near transcription start sites. cpg sites in such islands are often less methylated; thus, the genes are available for initiation of transcription. moreover, dnamet plays crucial roles in gene expression by not only blocking the promoter region but also altering the activities of regulatory elements, such as enhancers and insulators. alternatively, gene body methylation may influence alternative splicing  <cit> . thus, the cell identity is in part determined and maintained by a cell type-specific genome-wide methylation pattern, which may therefore be used in the laboratory as a marker to characterize the cell types .

the genome-wide dnamet profile of the cell changes; dnamet patterns are altered in diseases, such as alzheimer disease, cancer and type  <dig> diabetes, and are also influenced by the accumulating effects of environmental factors such as toxin exposure and diet  <cit> . single cpg sites undergo hypo- and hypermethylation either randomly by stochastic factors or via more systematic mechanisms  <cit> . for example, exposure to environmental factors such as smoking induces hypomethylation of a well-characterized single cpg site in the gene f2rl3; this represents an example of a non-random change in dnamet because the magnitude of the change is dose and exposure-time dependent  <cit> .

furthermore, the epigenome is modified by the biological aging process. as also heyn et al.  <cit>  reported and zampieri et al.  <cit>  reviewed, in general, aging induces a decrease in average dna methylation level genome-wide . this was demonstrated by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of newborns and centenarians with as high as ~90 % genomic coverage. the comparison of methylation states between the two extremes of the human lifespan also revealed how the systematic methylation patterns of the cpg sites are eventually lost and how inter-individual differences increase with advanced age. in addition, hypermethylation in regions near promoters can cause down-regulation of essential genes that influence vitally important pathways; heyn et al.  <cit>  reported that aging-accelerated hypermethylation events occurred in 13 % of the cpg sites among the millions of sites in the genome. therefore, methylation alterations may be considered as one important factor in the development of aging-associated diseases  <cit> .

many studies have addressed the aging-associated dnamet changes in blood cells using illumina array technology-based methods, which cover  <dig> or  <dig> cpg sites in the genome  <cit> . the methylation levels of specific cpg sites are known to be associated with chronological aging in a wide variety of tissues . however, as a whole, the sets of aging-associated cpgs identified in different studies, even with comparable tissues and age ranges, show limited overlap. only few ewass on age have taken the cell type heterogeneity into account . we and others  <cit>  hypothesize that lack of cell type adjustment may have potentially distorted the results obtained, and this may have contributed to the lack of concordance observed between the studies.

in this study, we aimed to discover and characterize regions where the dnamet levels are associated with chronological age  in a middle-aged population  through analysis where the cell type heterogeneity was adjusted for. middle-aged individuals were selected from the young finns study   <cit>  follow-up in 2011; the selection in the present study is a balanced sample , and it therefore provides an excellent opportunity to inspect the effects of aging on dna methylome. furthermore, this sample comprises individuals in an extremely narrow age range of only nine years. the subjects’ dna methylomes were characterized using illumina infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchips and the cell type heterogeneity and sex were adjusted for in the analysis.

additionally, our findings were interpreted together with compatible data obtained using the same 450beadchip technology, including our previous results obtained from an ewas on age , in which the subjects’ ages ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> years  <cit> , as well as other results compiled by steegenga et al.  <cit> . the results from the yfs were interpreted by considering that rates of aging-associated dnamet changes fluctuate, especially during the growth period before adulthood and at the end of the lifespan  <cit> . accordingly, the a-cpgs found in the yfs that overlap with those established from adult samples with wider age ranges, such as v90+ study, may be speculated to be dnamet regions with constant rate of change throughout adulthood. thus, we aimed to explore the a-cpgs where level of methylation changes in a clocklike fashion throughout adulthood from those that show a more random aging-associated pattern.

RESULTS
aging-associated alterations in dna methylation
in this study, the genome-wide dnamet levels in whole blood samples of middle-aged individuals were measured using 450beadchip technology. the sample heterogeneity  were estimated by comparing dnamet profiles to the reference dataset  <cit>  . the cell type proportions were verified as important determinants of variation in dnamet using spearman’s correlation analysis, in which the cell type proportions were correlated with the main principal components . the pcs were defined with principal component analysis  from the dnamet data without cell subtype adjustment . the analysis revealed that pc <dig> to pc <dig> together explained a large proportion  of the variance in the dna methylome data. among those pcs, several pcs had considerable large  correlation coefficients; thus, adjustments for the cell type proportion in the analysis were mandatory. the hypothesis whether dnamet level of a cpg site is associated with chronological age was tested at each cpg site using generalized linear regression analysis , where sex and cell type proportions were adjusted for.

we found  <dig> a-cpgs  in middle-aged individuals , of which  <dig>  were hypomethylated and  <dig>  were hypermethylated with advancing age. these hypo- and hypermethylated sites were annotated on  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. lists of the most significant aging-associations in yfs are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> and in additional file 3: table s <dig>  frequently reported cpg sites  located in the elovl <dig> , three sites in the fhl <dig> , two sites in the penk , and two sites in the klf <dig>  were also identified as hypermethylated in the present study.table  <dig> the top  <dig> hypermethylated a-cpgs in middle-aged individuals. the hypermethylated and hypomethylated a-cpgs are shown separately in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the top-ranking hypermethylated a-cpgs were selected with the following criteria: 1) direction of the association based on the value of beta regression  estimate of age; 2) more than one hit identified per gene  and 3) the top-ranking p-values. the full list of a-cpgs is shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  the q-value denotes the benjamini-hochberg-corrected p-value

interestingly, similar to correlation analysis results shown in additional file 2: table s1a, the cell type proportions were important determinants of variation in dnamet levels of the  <dig> a-cpgs as well . in this second correlation analysis, the pcs were defined with pca from dna methylation data of the  <dig> a-cpgs ; methylation data in pca were not adjusted for the cell subtype heterogeneity. correlation analysis revealed that pc1-pc <dig> determined more than 50 % of variance in methylation levels of these a-cpgs and these pcs correlated clearly with age and the cell counts. it is also worth of mentioning that of the  <dig> a-cpgs in our initial aging-association analysis, there were  <dig> multivariable regression models  where all cell count variables  were detected as statistically significant  predictors of dna methylation levels.

the importance of the cell count considerations was explored with an additional set of regression models, where the dna methylation level in each cpg site genome-wide was explained with age and sex only while the cell counts were not adjusted for. in this analysis, only  <dig> sites were classified as aging-associated  and these sites were all included to the original pool of  <dig> a-cpgs. the  <dig> a-cpgs are pointed out in the additional file 3: table s <dig> 

aging-associated hypermethylation and hypomethylation differ in their features. the exploration of aging-associations in the yfs revealed that hypermethylation was more frequent within genes with more association hits as shown in additional file 4: table s <dig> and fig. 1). specifically, there were  <dig> genes in total either with more than one hypomethylated or more than one hypermethylated a-cpgs per gene. of those,  <dig> genes comprised more than one hypomethylated a-cpgs per gene and  <dig> genes comprised more than one hypermethylated a-cpgs per gene as shown in additional file 4: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> numbers of aging-associated cpg sites  per gene in regard to hypermethylation and hypomethylation is visualized as bars. aging-associated hypermethylation was more frequent within genes with more association hits. first, the genes were categorized into groups based on the number of hypermethylated or hypomethylated a-cpg hits per gene. next, the frequencies of hypermethylated and hypomethylated a-cpgs within the groups were calculated. the number of a-cpgs for each group is shown inside each bar



next, the genomic locations of the a-cpgs were investigated, revealing that  <dig> of the  <dig> a-cpgs were located on cpg islands rather than island shores, shelves or non-island regions, and a majority  of those were hypermethylated . the remaining sites were distributed to shores, shelves and non-island regions with opposite manner as shown in additional file 1: figure s2; the aging-associated hypomethylation was more abundant on those regions. the a-cpg locations on genes were also investigated; no enrichment of a-cpgs was detected in the regions of 3′ untranslated regions , 5′utrs or close distances to transcription start sites or gene bodies . the distributions of the a-cpgs on chromosomes were also investigated; hypermethylated a-cpgs were over-represented on chromosome  <dig>  whereas hypomethylated sites were not enriched on any chromosome  . in addition, we ensured using visual examination that there were no spatial local cluster of a-cpgs on chr- <dig> 

sex specificity of the aging-associated cpg sites
to evaluate the sex specificity of the aging-associations, an interaction model with variables corresponding to sex, age and the interaction of sex and age  was constructed. no sex-specific a-cpgs were identified, as analysis revealed that no interaction term had a false discovery rate  below 5 %  in the interaction models. furthermore, we analyzed women  and men  separately as well: sex-specific a-cpgs were explored among all cpg sites with an multivariable regression model  where age and cell type proportion variables were used to predict dna methylation level in each cpg site. these analyses revealed that there were  <dig> and  <dig> a-cpgs  among men and women, respectively; these cpg sites were all included to our original pool of  <dig> a-cpgs which were detected using whole sample . importantly, as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  when the directions of change among the  <dig> a-cpgs were cross-compared between men and women , all sites, except one, showed concordant behavior regarding hypermethylation or hypomethylation during aging . this behavior was also identical to the directions of change among the  <dig> a-cpgs in the initial analysis . as a conclusion, these results were in line with our interaction analysis: there were no significantly sex-specific a-cpgs among middle-aged individuals.

functional roles of a-cpgs in the yfs
the gene ontology  functions and processes of the genes with a-cpgs were investigated using the gene ontology enrichment analysis and visualization  tool  <cit> . the analysis was conducted separately for genes with hypermethylated a-cpgs and for hypomethylated a-cpgs . the analysis revealed an unambiguous differences between hypo- and hypermethylated a-cpgs, as  <dig> go process terms and to  <dig> go function terms were enriched to genes with hypermethylated a-cpgs , whereas there was no enrichment of terms among the genes with hypomethylated a-cpgs . the most statistically significant processes were anatomical structure development  and morphogenesis , both of which cluster under the term ‘developmental process’.table  <dig> several go process terms were enriched within genes with hypermethylated a-cpgs in the analysis with gorilla  <cit> . this table represents the main clusters of processes . the full list of processes is shown in additional file 2: table s2



in addition, pscan  <cit>  was used to predict whether there were common regulators for groups of genes. the hypermethylation-associated genes were predicted to be regulated by  <dig> common transcription factors , several of which were zinc coordinating. for hypomethylation-associated genes, no common transcription factors were found. a large proportion of the  <dig> regulators of genes with hypermethylated a-cpgs in the yfs were zinc coordinating, and four  were identical to those identified in the v90+ study  <cit> .

comparisons to other studies
in the explorative cross-comparison analysis, the a-cpgs identified in middle-aged individuals of the yfs were compared to aging-associated dna methylome alterations between nonagenarians and 19–30-year-old individuals evidenced in our previous study   <cit> . the a-cpgs identified in the v90+ study were strongly associated with aging while the cell type heterogeneity was adjusted for in the analysis. a total of the  <dig> a-cpgs established in the yfs cohort,  <dig> a-cpgs were also aging-associated in the v90+ sample . of these  <dig> a-cpgs,  <dig>  were hypermethylated, and  <dig>  were hypomethylated with advancing age. furthermore, in  <dig> of the overlapping  <dig> a-cpgs the direction of the aging-associated change was the same: in the present and in the v90+ study,  <dig> a-cpgs were hypermethylated, and  <dig> were hypomethylated with advancing age .fig.  <dig> the direction of aging-association in  <dig> a-cpgs is visualized as scatterplot. each dot corresponds to single a-cpg; directions of associations correspond to estimates of age which are fetched from the regression models. of  <dig> sites,  <dig> cpg sites were similarly associated with aging in both the yfs and in the v90+ study. the analyses in both studies were adjusted for leukocyte cell subtype proportions, and the studies consisted of the samples with distinct age ranges: the yfs comprised  <dig> to  <dig> years old subjects whereas the v90+ study consisted of 19–30-year-old individuals and nonagenarians. the corresponding data illustrated in the fig.  <dig> is presented in additional file 3: table s4



finally, a-cpgs that were characterized from whole blood samples as aging-associated using  <dig> beadchip technology and previously reported by hannum et al.   <cit> , garagnani et al.   <cit>  and florath et al.   <cit>  and presented as summary table in steegenga et al  <cit>  were further compared with our data. the corresponding age of the samples ranged between  <dig> - <dig>  9– <dig> and 50– <dig> years, respectively. the comparison revealed  <dig> common cpg sites out of the  <dig> a-cpgs in two or more studies in addition to the yfs and the v90+ study .fig.  <dig> the top  <dig> most commonly reported a-cpgs and their direction of association with aging. the top  <dig> a-cpgs were selected with following criteria: the a-cpg was identified in present study and in the v90+ study, as well as in two or more other studies ; the sites were reported as aging-associated in blood samples and the data were obtained using  <dig> beadchip technology. methylation level differences in yfs between the highest and the lowest age groups , are illustrated as bars. the bars are colored according to the hypomethylation or hypermethylation status . gene annotation is shown for each bar, where applicable . the corresponding data is presented in additional file 3: table s4



discussion
in this study, we identified  <dig> a-cpgs where the dnamet level was associated with aging in middle-aged individuals , in whom the growth and development of youth has ended yet old age and its associated diseases had not begun. of the  <dig> a-cpgs,  <dig>  ​were hypomethylated, and  <dig>  were hypermethylated with advancing age, with annotations on  <dig> and  <dig> different genes, respectively. in general, the functional features of these aging-associated sites are mostly similar to those identified from cohorts with larger age differences. our study highlights also that a large number of sites undergo aging-associated dnamet level changes throughout adulthood and we speculate that a great proportion of those probably change with a clock-like manner.

a large fraction of the dnamet sites are altered during the lifespan, as shown by previous studies performed using 450beadchip technology  <cit>  and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing  <cit> . furthermore, the rates of these changes may fluctuate at different stages of the lifespan. studies have shown that a-cpgs behave differently during the growth period before adulthood and at the end of the lifespan  <cit> . nonetheless, there are genes  with cpg sites that are consistently detected as being aging-associated despite of differences in sample tissue types or age distributions ; notably, these genes were also identified in the present study as being aging-associated . however, a recent meta-analysis on three dnamet data sets obtained using 450beadchip illustrated discrepancies in the lists of regions where dnamet levels were altered during the entire human lifespan, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> years of age  <cit> . because blood sample heterogeneity has been shown to have a great impact on ewass  <cit> , our speculation is that the discrepancies might be due to the presence of different cell types.

in the primary analysis, we aimed to identify a-cpgs in middle-aged individuals representing general population with age range of only one decade. then, we cross-compared the results to those obtained with similar analysis pipeline from a population aged  <dig> to  <dig> years   <cit> . among the  <dig> a-cpgs characterized from the yfs with an age range of nine years,  <dig> sites had an identical association direction as detected in the vitality 90+ study, as shown in fig.  <dig> and in additional file 3: table s <dig>  we hypothesize that sites displaying aging-associated methylation changes in both populations possibly represent sites where the change in dna methylation follows a clock-like pattern. we further speculate that the non-overlapping cpg sites identified in the population with a wider age range  may possibly represent sites where the aging-associated change is accelerated in either early or late adulthood; the a-cpgs identified only when comparing group of nonagenarians to young adults may represent changes that reflect e.g. aging-associated pathologies or accumulation of aging-associated impairments.

as aging influences the immune system of men and women differently and as the risk rates of several diseases between sexes are unequal  <cit> , 1) an interaction analysis was performed to address the sex specificity of a-cpgs, and 2) the aging-associations were also evaluated in separate analyses among men and women. these analyses revealed no sex-specific single a-cpgs; thus, the identified a-cpgs are universally altered in both men and women. these results are in accordance with our previous results from the v90+ study, in which the dnamet states of nonagenarians were compared with 19–30-year-old individuals  <cit> , and with results published by others  <cit> . however, studies have shown that as a whole, the dna methylomes of males age more rapidly than those of females  <cit> .

aging-accelerated hypomethylation may be thought as an erosion-like event, whereas hypermethylation may be thought as an actively guided process. in practice, the difference between these features is manifested, for example, through the enrichment of go terms for groups of genes and for signaling pathways  <cit> . the distinct roles of the methylation status were demonstrated in the present study with the numbers of a-cpg hits in a gene, as we observed notable enrichment of hypermethylation events located in genes with more than one a-cpg . the functional roles of genes with a-cpgs were established by go term enrichment analysis, which revealed obvious difference between hypo- and hypermethylated a-cpgs, even though the analysis was conducted with an equal number of genes in the go term analyses. a high number of go terms were enriched to genes with hypermethylated a-cpgs , whereas there was no go term enrichment within genes with hypomethylated a-cpgs. the most statistically significant processes enriched to genes with hypermethylated a-cpgs were ‘anatomical structure development’ and ‘morphogenesis’, both of which cluster under the term ‘developmental process’. the enrichment of hypermethylated a-cpgs to these processes has been reported previously  <cit> . reynolds  <cit>  and yuan  <cit>  reported also that the cpg sites hypermethylated during aging are enriched to common processes and exhibit shared features, whereas hypomethylated a-cpgs are a less homogenous group. furthermore, age-associated hypermethylation interactome hotspots have been reported  <cit> .

in addition to the details mentioned above, we observed other similar hypermethylation characteristics in the yfs, as those reported in previous studies  <cit> . for example, the majority  of a-cpgs localized in cpg-islands  were hypermethylated, and an excess of hypermethylated a-cpgs were also found on chromosome  <dig>  however, there was no enrichment of a-cpgs on chromosome  <dig>  in the v90+ study, the hypermethylated a-cpgs located in the genes encoding zinc-associated proteins were more abundant on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , where zinc-finger genes are clustered. the zinc-finger genes  located in chromosome  <dig> are proposed to be repressors of endogenous retroviruses   <cit> , and the repressor activity may be disturbed by hypermethylation. interestingly, cpg sites located in the gene znf <dig> and almost all other genes encoding zinc-fingers on chromosome  <dig> were absent from our pool of  <dig> a-cpgs. thus, as the hypermethylation of cpg sites located in genes encoding zinc-fingers was observed in the oldest age group, we hypothesize that rates of methylation level changes at the cpg sites located in erv repressor genes  may fluctuate throughout the lifespan and that the rates may be enhanced in association with other senescence-related factors. therefore, it is possible that dnamet-based dysfunction of the repression system might explain the increased expression of ervs in old age  <cit> . future studies are required to address these questions.

to further inspect the roles of the genes with aging-accelerated dnamet changes, analysis of the common regulators  of groups of genes with hypermethylated and hypomethylated a-cpgs was conducted with pscan  <cit> . the results were again surprisingly concordant with those in the v90+ study. there were  <dig> regulators with unique identifiers for hypermethylated a-cpgs , whereas hypomethylated a-cpgs had no common regulators. a great proportion of the  <dig> regulators of genes with hypermethylated a-cpgs in the yfs were zinc coordinating, and four  were identical to those identified in the v90+ study results  <cit> . overall, the results from analysis of the functional roles of the genes with a-cpgs were surprisingly well in line with the observations from the v90+ study and supported the proposition that aging-associated hypermethylation is a more tightly regulated process, whereas aging-associated hypomethylation is induced more by environmental effects and stochastic factors.

finally, we demonstrated the lack of concordance in previously reported pools of a-cpgs by comparing three published lists of overlapping a-cpgs produced using 450beadchips from whole blood samples from subjects with age ranges of 50– <dig>  19– <dig> and 9– <dig>  <cit> . although  <dig> of the a-cpgs in the yfs showed similar association directions as in the v90+ study , we observed only  <dig> overlapping a-cpgs in the yfs and the v90+ study, which were also reported as aging-associated in one or more other robustly compatible studies . of these, only  <dig> a-cpgs were observed in two or more of the studies in the comparison . to the best of our knowledge  <cit> , the main factor that contributes to the dnamet profiles in blood cells is cell type heterogeneity; thus, we speculate that the lack of cell type adjustments may account for the majority of disparity in the cross-comparisons. the results of aging-association analysis and combined pca-correlation analysis in this study supports our speculation. cell type heterogeneity should be taken into account when analyzing samples composed of mixed cell types, but a limited number of such studies have been conducted .

notably, our study had an obvious limitation, it would substantially benefit from being a follow-up; therefore, future studies are needed. nevertheless, the analysis is powered by well-designed sample characteristics because each age group was matched by sex and sample size and because adjustments were made for cell type heterogeneity. thus, the analysis was sensitive enough to detect dnamet changes within an age range spanning nine years.

CONCLUSIONS
here we report that aging-associated dna methylation changes can be identified in a middle-aged population with a narrow age range of  <dig> years. aging-associated dnamet changes are not uniform, but occur due to different reasons, at different rates and directions in different parts of the genome and are not alike in all cell types. thus, due to this diverse nature of aging-associated dna methylation changes, all confounding factors should be accounted for in the analysis, in order to obtain comparable results. our results support the notion that cell type heterogeneity should be adjusted for when analyzing tissues consisting of mixed cell types. moreover, our results imply that considerable proportion of dnamet changes show clock-like behavior throughout adulthood.
