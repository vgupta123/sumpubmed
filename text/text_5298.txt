BACKGROUND
the gram-negative pathogen legionella pneumophila infects phagocytic cells such as various freshwater protozoa and human alveolar macrophages  <cit> . the bacteria enter the human lung via aerosols generated by man-made water systems, and cause severe and often fatal human pneumonia particularly in immunocompromised patients. one major virulence factor contributing to infection is the macrophage infectivity potentiator  protein. l. pneumophila strains lacking mip or expressing a mutant of mip with low ppiase activity were significantly attenuated in a guinea pig infection model  <cit> . the protein contributes to the disintegration of lung tissue and subsequent dissemination of the bacteria within the body. transwell assays support the idea that mip enables the bacteria to transmigrate across a barrier of lung epithelial cells and extracellular matrix  <cit> .

mip is a basic  <dig>  kda surface protein  localized at the outer membrane of the bacteria. cross-linking experiments revealed that it forms homodimers  <cit> . mip belongs to the fk <dig> binding protein  family exhibiting peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity , and is in this respect a homolog of human immunophilins like fkbp <dig>  the crystal structure indicated that each monomer consists of a c-terminal domain, which resembles fkbp <dig> in its folding pattern and is termed the fk <dig> binding domain . the fkbd is connected via a long , flexible α-helix to an n-terminal domain which mediates homodimerisation by forming an unusual, symmetrical bundle of four helices with the other monomer  <cit> .

although macrolides like azithromycin and chinolones are commonly used and represent efficient antibiotics for treating legionaires' disease, mortality rates of up to 20% may occur if older or immunocompromised patients are infected. mip is a potential alternative target for novel antibiotic therapies. the lipophilic macrolides fk <dig> or rapamycin  both are efficient inhibitors of the ppiase activity of fkbps, including mip and fkbp <dig>  <cit> . however, these drugs are also immunosuppressive  <cit> . they affect signal transduction pathways for t-cell activation and proliferation by binding to human fkbp <dig>  <cit> , the predominant cytosolic member of the fkbp family. targets of the emerging complexes are the human proteins calcineurin for fk <dig> and mtor, the mammalian target of rapamycin. this in turn affects interleukin- <dig>  which is required for the proper immune response. hence, neither of the drugs is suitable for the treatment of legionnaires' disease. a modified ligand blocking specifically the ppiase activity of mip but lacking the detrimental side-effects on human immune system is a putative agent against legionnaires' disease. details of the mip-rapamycin complex structure would provide insight into the binding processes and would thus allow for the identification of possible modifications of rapamycin to design an inhibitor without side effects. apart from l. pneumophila, fkbp homologues of the mip sub-family are also present in other human pathogens like neisseria gonorrhoeae  <cit> , chlamydia trachomatis  <cit>  or trypanosoma cruzi  <cit>  making the search for specific ligands even more rewarding  <cit> .

in this article we report on the nuclear magnetic resonance  investigation of the c-terminal ppiase domain of mip, comprising about  <dig> residues with ~35% sequence identity to human fkbp <dig>  <cit> . since dimerization is not required for the enzymatic activity we have studied the deletion mutant mip77– <dig>  which only consists of the fkbd with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the solution structures of mip and of the mip-rapamycin complex are compared to the fkbp12-rapamycin complex to advance rational design of drugs against legionnaires' disease.

RESULTS
structure of mip77–213
mip77– <dig> was composed of the c-terminal fkbd and n-terminal amino acids that formed part of the α-helix connecting the two domains in full-length mip. statistics for the structure calculation are listed in table  <dig>  the residues n- <dig> to n- <dig> of the shortened mutant formed a free-standing α-helix as also observed for the dimer . the c-terminal fkbd, which includes the active site, showed the typical fold, which was nearly identical to the crystal structure of full-length mip. it consisted of six β-strands, which formed an antiparallel sheet with the topology β1-β2-β5-β6-β3-β <dig>  a short helix α <dig> was located across this sheet. from n-terminus to c-terminus the secondary structure of mip77– <dig> included helix α <dig> , strands β <dig> , β <dig> , β <dig> , β <dig> , helix α <dig>  and strands β <dig>  and β <dig> . the strands were all connected by short loops except strands β <dig> and β <dig> which were connected by a long hairpin loop . similar to human fkbp <dig>  a hydrophobic cavity was formed in the presumed center of ppiase activity. it was located between the α4-helix and the interior side of the β-sheet and mostly composed of hydrophobic residues. the side chains of w- <dig> and f- <dig> formed the bottom of this pocket and were surrounded by y- <dig>  f- <dig>  d- <dig>  f- <dig>  q- <dig>  v- <dig>  i- <dig>  p- <dig>  and i- <dig>  the crystal structure of the mip homodimer is only slightly different from the solution structure presented here. the root mean square deviation  between the coordinates of the backbone without the termini  is  <dig>  nm between the two structures.

structure of the mip77–213-rapamycin complex
an analysis of chemical shift perturbation data from the 2d 15n-hsqc experiments of free and complexed mip77– <dig> indicated significant changes in the chemical environment of residues y- <dig>  d- <dig>  t- <dig>  f- <dig> to a- <dig>  a- <dig>  f- <dig>  f- <dig>  and k- <dig> upon binding of rapamycin. these residues were located in the hydrophobic cavity or in its direct vicinity, clearly indicating that the cleft was involved in binding rapamycin. this had already been assumed from the analysis of the structure of the homologous human fkbp <dig> in complex with fk <dig> and rapamycin. the data suggest that the loop between strand β <dig> and helix α <dig>  where chemical shift changes were most pronounced, plays a key role in recognition of the ligand.

the average structure of mip77– <dig> in complex with rapamycin was similar to the free protein with an rmsd between the backbone coordinates of only  <dig>  nm for residues a- <dig> to v- <dig> . structural statistics are listed in table  <dig>  while the secondary structure of mip remained nearly unchanged, the overlay of the average structures showed a structural rearrangement of the bulge interrupting strand β <dig>  as well as of the hairpin loop . upon binding, the former was significantly displaced, enlarging the binding pocket to accommodate the ligand. a distance of  <dig>  nm was observed between the positions of g- <dig> cα in the free and bound average structures. within the hairpin loop, intrinsic changes were observed. the part of the hydrophobic cavity that was formed by p- <dig> and i- <dig> in free mip77– <dig> became occupied by y- <dig>  for which a strong change in chemical shift had been observed. the stretch from v- <dig> to p- <dig> was bent away from the binding pocket, which was reflected in a lower rmsd of only  <dig>  nm between free and complexed protein, if these seven residues were not considered. the hairpin loop and the bulge were the two regions that contributed most to the overall rmsd. omitting these two regions, the rmsd between free and bound mip was  <dig>  nm for the backbone and  <dig>  nm for the secondary structure elements only. the overlay of an ensemble of  <dig> refined complex structures hinted at flexibility in these two sections. the hairpin loop appeared slightly flexible in the simulations, with a more stable n-terminal part .

a comparison with the crystal structure revealed that the orientation of the hairpin loop in the mip77–213-rapamycin complex was nearly identical to the orientation in free, full-length mip. this similar configuration resulted in a backbone rmsd value of  <dig>  nm between the two structures for residues a- <dig> to v- <dig>  in the solution structure of free mip77– <dig>  the orientation of the hairpin loop was different. y- <dig>  which formed the outer edge of the binding pocket in the crystal structure and in the complex, was displaced, and its position occupied by the residues p- <dig> and i- <dig> . this structural rearrangement in mip77– <dig> may be an artifact due to the lack of the dimerisation domain. in the crystal structure, the connecting α-helix was stabilized by the hairpin loop via side chain hydrogen bonds withdrawing the residues p- <dig> and i- <dig> from the hydrophobic cavity. in the mutant, high flexibility of the n-terminus may have rendered side chain interactions in this part of the helix unfavorable and caused the reorientation of the loop. however, for full-length mip in solution high flexibility of the hairpin loop was observed by nmr relaxation measurements  <cit> . apart from the hairpin loop, all three structures superimposed very well. without the loop, the rmsd values between the crystal structure and either free or bound mip were similar .

to further investigate the stabilization of the hairpin loop, heteronuclear relaxation rate constants r <dig> and r <dig> and nuclear overhauser effects  were measured for rapamycin-bound mip77– <dig> and compared to those for the free protein  <cit>  . as had also been observed for free mip, the relaxation data indicated the presence of a stable secondary structure in the complex. hetnoe values <  <dig> , indicating the presence of fast motion on a picosecond timescale  <cit> , were observed for most of the bulge residues  in the complex. this observation provided further evidence for flexibility and fast motion, in accordance with the results of the structure calculations. in free mip77– <dig>  similar values were found for these residues, indicating that the local dynamics of the bulge were not restricted by the presence of rapamycin. small differences  may be due to the structural reorientation of the bulge. different observations were made for the hairpin loop. for residues r- <dig> to g- <dig> of the free enzyme, hetnoes were smaller than  <dig>  and the r1/r <dig> values were elevated. upon binding of rapamycin, noe values were larger for these residues and r1/r <dig> values were not elevated. these differences reflect a decreased flexibility in this part of the hairpin loop in complexed mip as compared to the free protein. the overall correlation time τcee was derived from the measured r1/r <dig> ratios assuming isotropic tumbling. the correlation time was  <dig>  ns for free mip and  <dig>  ns for the mip-rapamycin complex. in order to assess whether this large change is in agreement with the solution structure of the complex, the correlation time for molecular tumbling was calculated from the expected hydrodynamic radius using hydronmr  <cit> . τc values of  <dig>  ns and  <dig>  ns were obtained for free mip and the complex, respectively, confirming that molecular tumbling was considerably slowed down by the increased hydrodynamic radius of the complex. the larger increase observed experimentally was most likely due to higher rigidity of the complexed protein, which was not considered in the theoretical model.

rapamycin was bound to mip with the pipecolyl ring  penetrating deep into the hydrophobic cavity. the ring was surrounded by the aromatic side chains of y- <dig>  f- <dig>  w- <dig>  and f- <dig> as well as by residues v- <dig> and i- <dig>  intermolecular noes were observed for all of these residues except for f- <dig>  the binding domain of rapamycin is comprised of the ester linkage, the pipecolyl ring, the dicarbonyl group, and the pyranosyl ring. the stretch from c <dig> to c <dig> was fully exposed, while the cyclohexyl ring was partly accessible to the solvent. rapamycin was not as well-defined as mip77– <dig>  due to the lack of intramolecular distance restraints. this fact was expressed by a higher average rmsd of the coordinates of all heavy atoms for rapamycin  than for the whole complex including the protein .

between y- <dig> oh and the rapamycin carbonyl group at c <dig>  an intermolecular hydrogen bond was observed in all of the calculated ensemble structures. another hydrogen bond involved y- <dig> oh and n <dig>  however, there were more possible acceptors for the hydrogen of y- <dig> oh at the inner side of the macrolide ring pointing towards the protein in the ensemble. another hydrogen bond was formed by y- <dig> oh and the carbonyl group at c <dig> of rapamycin. intermolecular contacts were also found for both oxygen atoms of residue d- <dig> and the oh-group at c <dig> 

sequence conservation
it has been demonstrated by wintermeyer et al. that both d-142-l and y-185-a mutations resulted in strongly reduced ppiase activity of the recombinant mip proteins   <cit> . in the complex, both amino acids were observed to be within the hydrophobic cavity and to form hydrogen bonds stabilizing the mip-rapamycin complex. since binding of rapamycin efficiently inhibits ppiase activity  <cit> , the hydrophobic cavity of the protein is most likely the active site of the enzyme.

the importance of the residues involved in binding of rapamycin is confirmed by their good or strict conservation in species of different kingdoms . galat has investigated fkbps with a molecular weight of about  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda from diverse organisms  <cit> . the residues corresponding to y- <dig>  f- <dig>  d- <dig>  f- <dig>  v- <dig>  and w- <dig> in mip are well conserved in all sequences among the two groups. i- <dig>  y- <dig>  and f- <dig> are even strictly conserved. except for y- <dig>  which plays a key role in binding of rapamycin, these residues form the hydrophobic cavity of free mip77– <dig>  additional residues of mip involved in binding without being conserved are q- <dig>  i- <dig>  and especially p- <dig>  which is rarely observed at this position in other fkbds. the two amino acids of the flexible loop p- <dig> and i- <dig> form part of the hydrophobic cavity in free mip77– <dig>  while q- <dig> is located on its edge.

comparison with human fkbp12-rapamycin complex
the homology of human fkbp <dig> and l. pneumophila mip is reflected in a high degree of similarity of their hydrophobic cavities. this cavity is formed by the residues y- <dig>  f- <dig>  d- <dig>  f- <dig>  e- <dig>  v- <dig>  i- <dig>  w- <dig>  y- <dig>  and f- <dig> in fkbp <dig>  all residues occupy identical positions as their counterparts in mip, where f- <dig> is the only exception. the functional analogue in mip is f- <dig>  while the corresponding sequence position is occupied by a- <dig>  interestingly, the sequence position corresponding to f- <dig> in mip is occupied by f- <dig> in fkbp <dig>  which does not directly contribute to binding in the fkbp12-drug complexes. this functional substitution forces a rotation in the side chain of f- <dig> by about 100° as compared to f- <dig> in the crystal structure of the fkbp12-rapamycin-complex . the orientation of f <dig> was experimentally well defined by a total of  <dig> intramolecular  noes and  <dig> intermolecular noes to rapamycin. apart from fkbp <dig>  there are other fkbds with a triad -fxf- at this sequence position, which is either substituted by -xxf- or -fxx- among other representatives of this group of proteins . this might represent an example of a compensatory mutation  <cit>  during the evolution of the fkbds. interestingly, the conformation of the side chain of f- <dig> in the fkbp12-rapamycin complex is similar to that of one of f- <dig> in the solution structure of free mip77– <dig>  while the side chain conformation of f- <dig> in the mip77–213-rapamycin complex is similar to the crystal structure of free mip . for the secondary structure of bound mip this has the consequence that the c-terminal segment of strand β <dig> is slightly steeper than in free mip or in bound fkbp <dig> . this difference explains the observed displacement of the bulge of sheet β <dig>  a further structural difference between the two proteins is that y- <dig> forms part of the hydrophobic cavity in both the crystal  <cit>  and the solution structure  <cit>  of free fkbp <dig>  the respective counterpart in mip is y- <dig>  which is part of the binding pocket only in the crystal structure, and replaced by p- <dig> and i- <dig> in the solution structure. as a consequence, structural rearrangements upon binding with rapamycin are less pronounced in fkbp <dig>  <cit>  than for mip .

previous nmr investigations of the fkbp12-fk <dig>  <cit>  complex revealed that, in contrast to the uncomplexed fkbp <dig>  the residues y- <dig> to h- <dig> of the hairpin loop  were rigidly fixed. the flexibility was reduced due to stabilizing interactions by the side chains of h- <dig> and i- <dig>  as well as by a hydrogen bond from y- <dig> to the c <dig> carbonyl of fk <dig>  the conclusion that y- <dig> is a key residue in fkbp <dig> was further supported by its substitution with leucine  <cit> . the results for the mip77–213-rapamycin complex are completely analogous to these observations. y- <dig>  the counterpart of y- <dig> in fkbp <dig>  plays the same role in the hairpin loop in mip. since this is a common scheme in both proteins, flexibility of the loop may be crucial for the recognition of the protein targets calcineurin and mtor, respectively, and also for selectivity of the binding.

implications for drug design
the high structural similarity between the mip-rapamycin and fkbp12-rapamycin complexes suggests that fkbp <dig> ligands are suitable leads for drug design. rapamycin itself appears as a promising starting point for two reasons. first, rapamycin is an approved and widely used drug, making undesired side effects of its derivatives less probable than for totally new agents. second, substances based on rapamycin have the potential to be highly active against legionnaires' disease, because unmodified rapamycin is a subnanomolar inhibitor of fkbp <dig>  <cit>   and on the other hand has been shown to inhibit penetration of a lung epithelial barrier by l. pneumophila in vitro  <cit> . the immunosuppresive properties of novel derivatives may be avoided according to the dual domain concept, which implies separate fkbp binding and effector domains in the drug. immune modulation is mediated by binding a target protein to the effector domain. in the mip-rapamycin complex molecular contacts are found exclusively to the fkbp binding domain of rapamycin, suggesting that the removal of the effector domain would not influence affinity. inhibitors composed only of the fkbp binding domain but lacking the effector domain were suggested to have no influence on the immune response. drug molecules such as, for example, the sub-nanomolar inhibitor v- <dig>    <cit> , or a series of sub-micromolar inhibitors of fkbp <dig>  <cit> , do not affect the immune response or calcineurin activity  <cit> , respectively. however, it has been shown that fk <dig>   <cit>  as well as v- <dig>  foster nerve regeneration in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . these side effects call for further investigations and clinical trials before a novel drug may be approved.

CONCLUSIONS
structural similarity between the mip-rapamycin and the fkbp12-rapamycin complexes suggest an identical binding mode of inhibitors in both proteins. the vast number of fkbp <dig> inhibitors may therefore be used to find a novel agent against legionnaires' disease. strategies to avoid unwanted immune modulation caused by interference with calcineurin presumably pertain to mip as well. rational drug design starting from known derivatives of rapamycin may take advantage of the presented solution structure of the mip77–213-rapamycin complex. compared to strategies relying solely on the dual domain concept or bottom-up design this approach potentially offers a better chance to avoid unwanted side effects.
