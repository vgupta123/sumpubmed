BACKGROUND
chinese bayberry  is an economically important subtropical fruit crop native to southern china and other asian countries  <cit> . the fruit is popular for its appealing color, delicious taste, and essential micro-nutrients and bioactive constituents such as antioxidants  <cit>  and anti-tumor  <cit> . the fruit can be eaten fresh, canned, dried, and is widely used in wine-making and juice-making. chinese bayberry is widely planted not only as a fruit crop, but also for forestry  <cit> . there is a large germplasm resource for chinese bayberry and fruit characteristics vary widely among different cultivars  <cit> . moreover, bayberry fruit undergoes rapid changes in pigments, sugars, organic acids and many other quality components during fruit development and ripening, which provides a very useful model for studying fruit quality, particularly properties associated with color, taste and health-associated nutrients.

despite the economic and ecological importance of chinese bayberry, there is no genomic resource for this non-model genus, with only  <dig> nucleotide sequences deposited in genbank . current biological studies on this plant, including photosynthesis and stress responses  <cit> , growth regulation  <cit> , and postharvest responses  <cit>  have mostly been carried out at the physiological level. to date, the genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis as well as a transcription factor gene mrmyb <dig> have been obtained  <cit>  by our group, showing the potential for functional genomic research for this crop. however, a lack of sequence data has become a limitation for extensive and intensive research on this fruit crop.

for woody plants, especially those of high heterozygosity, such as chinese bayberry, whole genome sequencing requires long-term and expensive investment, and therefore is currently limited to only few species. instead, it has been more useful to obtain information of unigenes through transcriptome sequencing  <cit> . the recent rna-seq based on ngs  enables studies to be carried out on species without corresponding sequenced genome information as a reference  <cit> . it has become widely applied to model as well as non-model organisms to obtain mass sequence data for molecular marker development, gene discovery and transcriptional analysis  <cit> . compared with traditional laboratory methods, rna-seq is a high throughput technology, overcoming the weakness of microarrays in exploring unknown genes. furthermore, it has great advantages in examining transcriptome fine structure, such as detection of allele-specific expression and splice junction variation  <cit> .

in the present work, an rna-seq project for chinese bayberry was initiated . four rna samples containing various tissues and fruit of different development and ripening stages were sequenced using the latest illumina deep sequencing technique. the objective of the present study is to gain an understanding of molecular mechanisms of fruit quality changes during ripening and establish a sound foundation for future molecular studies based on high throughput sequence and expression data.

RESULTS
rna-seq
to obtain a general overview of the chinese bayberry transcriptome, four libraries  were designed for rna-seq. mr <dig> was a mixture of equal amounts of rna from stems and leaves , buds , flowers , and young fruit , while mr2- <dig> were fruit at breaker stage, red maturity stage, and dark red maturity stage, respectively . all samples were taken from a single tree of the cultivar 'biqi' to provide the same genetic background and thus to make assembly easier. root rna was not included in these libraries to avoid potential contamination from mycorrhizal fungi which are not easy to be removed from the root tissue. each library produced  <dig> m raw data, from paired-end  reads with a single read length about  <dig> bp and a q <dig> percentage  over 93% . this is higher than the 88% for similar work from tea  <cit> , likely to be due to the development of the sequencing technology. all these data showed that the throughput and sequencing quality was high enough for further analysis.

a q <dig> percentage indicates the percentage of sequences with sequencing error rate lower than 1%, b n percentage indicates the percentage of nucleotides which could not be sequenced.

in previous works, take illumina platform as an example, pe reads of  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp were de novo assembled to obtain transcriptome reference, and then  <dig> bp-tags or  <dig> bp single-end  reads, from other runs of deep sequencing, were mapped back to the reference for expression annotation in different transcripts  <cit> . in this study, however, a novel experimental design was applied. four rna samples, each ligated with a different adapter, were sequenced altogether in a same run. the data produced from the mixed samples were used to construct the whole transcriptome file, and meanwhile, they were used as the reference and combine with data from each separate sample to do further gene expression analysis. in addition to being less costly, longer reads were easier and more probably to be mapped into correct transcript sequences than shorter ones, especially for the higher plant species which contain more gene family members. this strategy can be generally ideal for species without a good reference.

de novo assembly
short reads from four libraries were assembled into  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs with a mean length of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. these were assembled into scaffolds and unigenes, taking the distance of pe reads into account. mr <dig> contained approximately  <dig>  unigenes, while the other libraries had around  <dig> , with a mean length of unigenes from each library ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . all these sequences were assembled to give  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes with a mean length of  <dig> bp. a n <dig> length of  <dig> bp, i.e., half of the assembled bases were incorporated into unigenes with a length at least  <dig> bp, was obtained, with one third  having a length over  <dig> bp . the average gap percentage  was  <dig> %.  <dig> % of the unigenes had no gap, and less than 2% of the unigenes had gap over 20% . the mean depth of unigenes was  <dig> , while  <dig> % and  <dig> % of unigenes had the depth over  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively .

functional annotation
approximately 80% of unigenes  were annotated by blastx, with a threshold of 10- <dig>  to four public databases  database, the swiss-prot protein database, the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database, and the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins  database). among them,  <dig>  unigenes could be annotated to the nr database, while  <dig>  unigenes could be annotated to all the databases . based on nr annotation and the e-value distribution,  <dig> % of the mapped sequences showed strong homology , and  <dig> % were very strong homology  to available plant sequences . the  <dig> top-hit species based on nr annotation are shown in figure 2c. nearly 70% of unigenes can be annotated with sequences from  <dig> top-hit species, i.e., arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, arabidopsis lyrata, populus trichocarpa, and vitis vinifera. over  <dig>  unigenes were classed into three gene ontology categories: cellular component, biological process, and molecular function. under the cellular component category, large numbers of unigenes were categorized as cell and organelle. for the biological process category, metabolic process  and cellular process  represented the major proportion. under the molecular function category, binding  and catalytic activity  were the top two most abundant sub-categories .

there were  <dig>  unigenes mapped into  <dig> kegg pathways. the maps with highest unigene representation were plant-pathogen interaction , followed by spliceosome  and ribosome . the pathways with highest representation were purine metabolism , starch and sucrose metabolism  and pyrimidine metabolism , respectively . from these pathways, information on chinese bayberry metabolism can be obtained. as an example, biosynthesis of ascorbic acid , an important component of bayberry fruit, was examined. there are four biosynthetic pathways for asa in plants, the smirnoff-wheeler , galactonate, glucose, and myo-inositol pathways  <cit> . in chinese bayberry, the sequences for all  <dig> genes in the s-w pathway were assembled; however, this was not the case for the other three pathways . therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that s-w pathway is the main pathway for the biosynthesis of asa in chinese bayberry, unlike that in kiwifruit, which possesses both s-w and the myo-inositol pathways  <cit>  and in strawberry, where the galactonate pathway was firstly discovered  <cit> . such annotations provide a good platform for further research into understanding metabolic pathways in this species. in contrast, the ko  ids were used in interactive pathways  analysis and were helpful for the study of fruit quality related metabolism .

although only  <dig> % of all annotated unigenes were found in the swissprot database , the functional annotation provided by this database may be more reliable due to manually reviewed annotation. it was noteworthy that all the  <dig>  unigenes annotated against cog were included in swissprot annotated unigenes . the cog database represented major phylogenetic lineages of chinese bayberry, as shown in additional file  <dig>  this data would be useful in researching protein classification and evolution rates. the fact that  <dig> %  of  <dig>  unigenes share homology with signal transduction  or transcription factors , which is higher than those in tomato  <cit> , confirms that bayberry fruit development and ripening requires complex regulatory processes.

through blastx against the databases mentioned above, the direction and region of cds  were extracted from the sequences.  <dig>  cds were translated into peptide sequences, over 10% of which  had a length over  <dig> aa, with the  <dig> longest unigenes having a length over  <dig> aa. the detailed length distribution is shown in additional file 2d.

expression profiling during ripening
the rpkm method, first proposed by mortazavi in  <dig>  <cit> , is widely used in expression annotation of rna-seq data. we therefore used this method as a means to calculate the expression of unigenes in chinese bayberry.  <dig>  unigenes were expressed during fruit ripening, with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> showing differential expression between mr <dig> and mr <dig>  mr <dig> and mr <dig>  mr <dig> and mr <dig>  respectively. when mixed together,  <dig>  unigenes were differentially expressed during fruit ripening and hence were further analysed. for a global view of expression patterns, the expression level of  <dig>  unigenes which changed less than  <dig> fold , was visualized in  <dig> dimensional space . this gives an overall understanding about the expression changes of unigenes. moreover,  <dig> groups were defined according to their expression profiles, containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  unigenes, respectively. group i was defined as up-regulated, group iv as down-regulated, and groups ii and iii had irregular expression patterns . the lowly expressed unigenes at the start point could change over  <dig>  fold. ten groups of unigenes with the similar expression trends were identified and shown in additional file  <dig>  and the detailed co-expression relationships of the top  <dig> related unigenes listed in additional file  <dig> 

the proportions and comparisons between up-regulated and down-regulated unigenes were summarized in three main functional categories . metabolism and catalytic activity were major responsive classes, where the number of up-regulated unigenes was significantly higher than those down-regulated. this suggests that metabolic processes are enhanced and catalytic activity increases during fruit ripening.

metabolic pathway analysis during fruit ripening
to provide a global view of chinese bayberry metabolism,  <dig>  genes with different ko ids were submitted for analysis via the on-line interactive pathways  explorer v <dig> and mapped to  <dig>  pathways . the dynamic change and absolute expression magnitudes during fruit ripening were shown in additional file  <dig>  the lines shown in figure  <dig> indicated genes that mapped to pathways including metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleotides and energy metabolism. green lines indicated that the expression of most members in a specific gene family did not differ significantly over fruit ripening. some pathways , such as pentose phosphate metabolism  which generates nadph for increasing the metabolic rate during ripening, showed enhancement, which was in accord with the result of go comparisons . the expression of many elements encoding anthocyanin biosynthesis was also increased . however, the genes encoding the first three steps of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate  to zeta-carotene decreased , which was consistent with the absence of carotenoids in fully ripe fruit. expression of sps  and gad  increased , while the genes involved in the tca cycle showed no significant change in expression.

interactive pathways  is an open-access online tool that integrates  <dig> kegg maps from  <dig> species  <cit> . it has been used in association with rna-seq transcriptomics  <cit> , for example, in the analysis of solanum glandular trichomes  <cit> , and global metabolic map analysis of horned beetles  <cit> . in the present study, the ipath application provided an interactive metabolic net associated with gene expression changes during fruit ripening in chinese bayberry. a focus was then made on two important fruit quality traits: color and taste.

genes related to color development
during the later stages of development, chinese bayberry  undergoes a rapid change in color, from green to dark red, due to the degradation of chlorophylls and the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, mainly cyanidin-3-glucoside. comparing three ripening stages, the cirg value, which matched visual perception of color differences of chinese bayberry  <cit> , increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , reflecting the increase in intensity of color as fruit ripens . previous literatures suggested that the fruit anthocyanin content at full maturity is well correlated with the cumulative expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in many crops, including grape  <cit> , apple  <cit> , litchi  <cit> , and chinese bayberry  <cit> . in this work, unigenes participating in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway were selected and studied in detail, and it was observed that expression of  <dig> unigenes  were up-regulated . all the genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthesis, except for chalcone isomerase , showed significantly up-regulated expression, and the expression of one unigene encoding chi also increased  <dig>  fold between  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf. in addition, ipath analysis also showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> steps for the biosynthesis of anthocyanin were up-regulated during fruit ripening . these results coincided with the q-pcr results from previous work  <cit> . a co-expression network for the  <dig> up-regulated unigenes was built, and  <dig> unigenes with similar expression trends were examined . a sub-set of these may have functions related to anthocyanin biosynthesis, which could be of value to be further evaluated.

a no. all indicates the total number of unigenes analysed, b no. change indicates the number of unigenes with expression significantly changed during fruit ripening, c no. up indicates the number of unigenes with expression significantly up-regulated during fruit ripening,

d no. down indicates the number of unigenes with expression significantly down-regulated during fruit ripening, e / indicates that this protein is not an enzyme, f \ indicates omission of numbers of ko id because different subunits of v-atpase have different ko ids.

the correlated expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes with color change during ripening is consistent with coordinated regulation by a myb transcription factor, as reported in many other fruits  <cit> . of the  <dig> r2r3-mybs present in the chinese bayberry data-set, two unigenes  were clustered together with atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  which were identified as transcription factors related to anthocyanin biosynthesis . the unigene  <dig> had 100% similarity in amino acid sequence to mrmyb <dig>  which has been reported to control bayberry fruit anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . however, the unigene  <dig> showed a premature translation termination codon, which would result in a peptide of only  <dig> amino acids, rather than around  <dig> amino acids for mrmyb <dig>  and a very low expression magnitude, and is therefore unlikely to have a role in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. overexpression of myb transcription factors can lead to increased anthocyanin production in transgenic tomato, apple and strawberry  <cit> , and similar phenotypic changes were observed in tobacco and arabidopsis transformed with mrmyb <dig> .

genes related to taste quality
sugar and acidity provide the most important contributions to taste. during fruit ripening, chinese bayberry fruit became sweeter and less acetous. total soluble solids , an indicator of the degree of sweetness, increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> . sucrose, which accounts for approximately 60% of the total soluble sugars, rapidly increased from  <dig>  mg/g to  <dig>  mg/g .  <dig> unigenes involved in sucrose metabolism were identified , and the expression of five unigenes encoding sucrose phosphate synthase   increased rapidly  during fruit ripening, which was consistent with q-pcr results . the expression of sucrose synthase  did not show significant change. all the unigenes annotated as invertase, which converts sucrose into glucose and fructose, showed low expression magnitude, in spite of the fact that two unigenes were up-regulated and one down-regulated . when considered together with the ipath data , it was concluded that sps was likely to be the key gene controlling sucrose accumulation in chinese bayberry fruit, as what observed in citrus  <cit> , sugarcane  <cit> , and banana  <cit> . furthermore, ten candidate unigenes for sucrose transporters  were examined , but none showed significant expression change during fruit ripening .

the ph value of bayberry fruit juice increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  during fruit ripening. the content of citric acid, the main organic acid, which accounts for over 95% of total organic acids, decreased from  <dig>  mg/g to  <dig>  mg/g . the genes encoding the tca cycle showed no significant change in expression during fruit ripening . as to the gaba shunt, gene expression of all three unigenes encoding glutamate decarboxylase  were increased, two of which  were up-regulated significantly , which coincided with the q-pcr results . it has been reported that gad activity participated in regulating cytosolic ph  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of gad expression may be one of the key factors in citric acid degradation. meanwhile, one unigene encoding glutamine synthase   increased significantly , with the expression magnitude of this gene always high . therefore, glutamate might be utilized by other pathways, causing the loss of accumulation of citric acid. a similar viewpoint was proposed by cercos in citrus  <cit> .

it is widely known that citrate can be transported, mediated by a vacuolar h+-atpase or a citrate/h+ symporter, between the vacuole and cytoplasm to maintain homeostasis  <cit> . it was suggested that a large influx of protons is required and that this is mediated by the vacuolar h+-atpase  <cit> , a multi-heteromeric complex of at least  <dig> different subunits  <cit> . during fruit ripening, the expression of vacuolar h+-atpase a subunit was increased in tomato  <cit>  and grape  <cit> , while a number of other subunits are still largely uncharacterized at the molecular level. in the present study,  <dig> unigenes encoding vacuolar h+-atpase subunits, with one encoding subunit a, were found. three unigenes, but none of them encoding subunit a, showed up-regulated expression . further more detailed work is needed to elucidate whether and how vacuolar h+-atpase participates in regulation of organic acid accumulation in chinese bayberry fruit. on the other hand, citrate may also be removed from the vacuole via a citrate/h+ symporter. the expression of a citrus symporter  decreased in line with the reduction in acidity during fruit ripening  <cit> . in chinese bayberry, however, only one unigene encoding a citrate/h+ symporter was detected but this showed no change in gene expression during fruit ripening .

future perspectives
transcription factors play important roles in regulation of plant growth, including fruit development and ripening. additional file  <dig> shows  <dig>  unigenes classified as transcription factors based on annotation by the cog database, accounting for  <dig> % of the annotated unigenes. through blastx to tfs downloaded from planttfdb with an e value threshold of 10- <dig>   <dig>  unigenes encoding transcription factors from  <dig> families were obtained. in future work these transcription factors could be used to build a network between tfs and their target genes, based on their co-expression relationships.

chinese bayberry has rich germplasm resources, with variable fruit characteristics in size, color, taste, texture and bioactive components  <cit> . with the data provided by this study, critical genes involved in development and regulation of these fruit quality attributes can be characterized and the mechanisms elucidated at the molecular level, which can further contribute to understanding of fruit biology as well as exploring manipulations for fruit production and quality improvement. currently, we are carrying out further rna-seq of fruit from various cultivars with different contents of organic acids. based on this information and related physiological data, we hope to build a regulatory network of citric acid metabolism in chinese bayberry fruit.

CONCLUSIONS
based on mass sequence data of chinese bayberry obtained by rna-seq, many unigenes were identified and annotated, which provides an excellent platform for future genetic and functional genomic research. genes related to fruit quality and their expression profiles through three fruit ripening stages were analysed further. this offered new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying chinese bayberry fruit characteristics. the up-regulated unigenes encoding anthocyanin biosynthesis and mrmyb <dig> played roles in accumulation of anthocyanin and the development of the deep dark-red color. the up-regulated expression of sps could be associated with the increase in sweetness, while gad may participate in accumulation and loss of organic acids during fruit ripening. the study provides a platform for further functional genomic research on this fruit crop, and a reference for study of complicated metabolism in non-model perennial species.
