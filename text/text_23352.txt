BACKGROUND
spliceosomal introns are key attributes of most eukaryotic genes. their origin is still unclear, though descent from group ii self-splicing introns seems to be likely  <cit> . all components essential for removal of intronic sequences, a prerequisite for maturation of most transcripts and formation of functional gene products, have been identified in basal eukaryotes  <cit> , indicating that the ability to cope with spliceosomal introns was fully developed in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes. in addition to their obscure provenance, spliceosomal introns present another unresolved enigma. in many taxa, intron dynamics is dominated by losses, and gains of introns were often found to be rare . in recent mass analyses of various vertebrate genomes, no intron gains were detected  <cit> . with some genes and lineages, however, intron acquisition can hardly be questioned  <cit> . several proposals have been brought forward to explain intron birth  <cit> , but how these sequences were actually created, is still mysterious.

the serpins are a superfamily of proteins that cover a highly divergent spectrum of functions  <cit> . the origin of these proteins, primarily encompassing inhibitors of serine proteases, but also including members with entirely other tasks, is not known. serpins are found in all major branches of the tree of life, but they are rare in fungi, and their distribution in archaea and eubacteria is disjunct. in vertebrates, serpins participate in the control of blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and other proteolytic pathways  <cit> . in both vertebrates and invertebrates, serpins are also engaged in regulating the innate immune response. an arms race between proteases of pathogens and host protease inhibitors, and vice versa, was proposed to foster functional diversification of serpins  <cit> .

in vertebrates, serpin genes are often arranged in tandem arrays and they constitute a substantial fraction of mammalian genomes. during diversification of vertebrates the superfamily has undergone considerable expansion  <cit> . serpins are unusual compared to most other superfamilies with regards to the dynamics of gene organization. genes from basal metazoans, such as annelids  <cit>  or sea anemones  <cit> , often share an intron-rich structure with their vertebrate homologues, implying that introns may be stably maintained for hundreds of millions of years. serpin genes of basal metazoans, in contrast, are not generally intron-rich, and their exon-intron structures are not conserved along the lineages leading to vertebrates. sporadic investigations of various species revealed radically different intron patterns in serpin genes, indicating that, during diversification of eumetazoans, massive changes in gene architectures have occurred  <cit> . the structures of serpin genes from various vertebrates , however, proved to be strongly conserved, enabling reliable, intron-coded classification of the superfamily into six groups . generally, there is very little congruence between these groups concerning numbers and positions of introns. altogether,  <dig> different intron positions mapping to the serpin scaffold were detected, but none of them is common to the entire superfamily  <cit> .

here, we investigated the structures of serpin genes from lineages that pre- and postdate the split of vertebrates in order to get insight into the dynamics of their introns. the data disclose that, after establishment of major groups of vertebrate serpin genes, multiple non-canonical introns emerged in a lineage of ray-finned fishes.

RESULTS
appearance of exon-intron patterns characteristic for vertebrate serpins
we first studied serpin genes and their cdnas in two lancelet species, branchiostoma lanceolatum  and branchiostoma floridae , representing a group of extant cephalochordates . experimental approaches disclosed several genes and cdnas coding for serpins in b. lanceolatum, further superfamily members were detected by mining the genome of the closely related b. floridae  <cit> . altogether, three types of serpin genes  with distinctly different intron patterns were observed . following the previous convention  <cit> , intron positions are projected onto the sequence of the human serpin α1-antitrypsin. the phases of introns are indicated by the suffixes a-c, according to their location after the first, second, or third base of the codon in question. in this reference system, the two introns of l <dig> genes map to positions 75c and ~176a . the l <dig> genes contain introns at positions ~86b, 151c, 223b, 283c and 339c. the l <dig> genes exhibit common introns at positions 73b, 125b, ~175c and 339c, however, there are also introns that are unique to individual group members . another intron in bflor_spn <dig> is located outside the conserved serpin scaffold . there are several additional serpin-like sequences in the b. floridae genome, but it is currently not discernible whether they represent intact genes ; however, it is clear that serpin genes from lancelets and vertebrates differ largely with respect to their exon-intron organizations. in fact, just a single intron location  is shared. apparently, major changes affecting the exon-intron patterns of serpin genes have occurred since the cephalochordate/vertebrate split.

having established lancelets as appropriate outgroup for evaluating evolution of serpins in vertebrates, we turned to lampreys, a group of basal, jawless fishes. lampreys, in sharp contrast with lancelets, depict at least four of the six canonical groups of vertebrate serpins. a survey of cdna and genomic sequences from lampetra fluviatilis  and from petromyzon marinus  revealed representatives of groups v <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig> . we also infer that intact members of group v <dig> exist as indicated by the isolation of a corresponding full-length cdna from l. fluviatilis. the associated gene contains all introns characteristic for group v <dig> with the exception of the 78c intron that, presumably due to its large size, remained undetected . members of groups v <dig> and v <dig> were not identified.

inspection of lamprey serpin sequences disclosed the presence of angiotensinogen and heparin cofactor ii , two prominent members of group v <dig>  all known angiotensinogen proteins depict a conserved decapeptide sequence close to the n-terminus that, after controlled enzymatic cleavage, gives rise to formation of peptides  involved in blood pressure regulation and other important physiological processes  <cit> . clearly, such a sequence is also present in angiotensinogen orthologues from l. fluviatilis and p. marinus . the nviyfkg signature , among other features, definitely reveals this protein as member of the serpin superfamily.

hcii, a serpin well known from various tetrapods, is a potent thrombin inhibitor in the presence of glycosaminoglycans . characteristic features of all hcii sequences are the highly conserved arg/lys-rich helix d that is involved in gag binding and the acidic n-terminal extension that mediates gag accelerated thrombin inhibition  <cit> . these features are also found in lamprey hcii . the genes coding for angiotensinogen and hcii from lampreys each depict introns that interrupt the serpin scaffold at positions 192a, 282b, and 331c . beyond that, there are additional introns mapping to the n-terminus of hcii from p. marinus . we also recognized a lamprey serpin exhibiting the exon-intron pattern of group v <dig>  as hsp <dig> orthologue. hsp <dig>  a non-inhibitory serpin, is a specialized er residing chaperone involved in folding and transport of procollagens  <cit> . a hallmark of all hsp <dig> proteins is the c-terminal er retention/retrieval signal . we conclude that angiotensinogen, hcii, and hsp <dig> are distinct members of the serpin superfamily that appeared early during vertebrate evolution. these proteins have persisted since at least  <dig> million years, assuming that the morphological concordance between a fossil lamprey from the devonian period  <cit>  and its present-day relatives is reflected on the molecular level.

serpin genes with non-standard exon-intron patterns
after curtailing the emergence of major groups of vertebrate serpin genes, the dynamics of their exon-intron patterns was analyzed. the list of species investigated included: man, chicken , the clawed frog , and several fishes including danio rerio , oryzias latipes , gasterosteus aculeatus , tetraodon nigroviridis , and takifugu rubripes . several serpin genes, though clearly members of one of the six canonical groups, were found to deflect from the standard organizations. like their counterparts in lampreys, angiotensinogen genes of tetrapods and d. rerio exhibit the canonical gene architecture of group v <dig>  the t. rubripes orthologue, however, contains two extra introns that split the exonic sequences at positions 77c and 233c, respectively . these surplus introns are also present in the orthologues of o. latipes and g. aculeatus, but they are not found in any other vertebrate serpins. in the current release of the t. nigroviridis genome, the angiotensinogen gene is not represented. est data revealed  that, in g. aculeatus, the extra introns are indeed spliced out, rejecting the argument that they are artifacts.

the hcii genes of mammals  <cit> , chicken, x. tropicalis and d. rerio uniformly depict the conserved intron pattern of group v <dig>  deviations from the standard structure, however, were observed in lampreys and in several fishes. the hcii orthologues of o. latipes, g. aculeatus, t. rubripes and t. nigroviridis each contain a non-standard intron mapping to position 241c . est analyses confirmed expression and correct splicing of the hcii transcript in o. latipes . to our knowledge, there are no other vertebrate serpins possessing an intron at this position. a gain that occurred after the split of the d. rerio lineage from the other ray-finned fishes thus may explain appearance of this intron. another extra intron in the hcii genes of pufferfishes maps to the inhibitor's n-terminal tail . though also found in o. latipes and g. aculeatus, this intron here is not considered any further, due to its location outside the serpin scaffold. examination of lamprey hcii also revealed unique introns. the 83c intron  is embedded in a well-conserved region; its origin, however, is difficult to evaluate. the others  map to the n-terminal extension .

database searches also disclosed members of group v <dig>  dubbed spn_94a, with a surplus intron at position 94a . in o. latipes, g. aculeatus, t. rubripes and t. nigroviridis, these genes are flanked by a conserved set of markers . the imbedded serpin genes thus are derived from a common ancestor. position 94a was previously not known to harbor introns in vertebrate serpins. inspection of chromosomal gene order revealed that d. rerio also contains spn_94a; the extra intron, however, is missing, suggesting that it was gained after divergence of the d. rerio lineage. in pufferfishes, two further members of group v <dig> with an extra intron, located at position 215c, were identified . the origin of these genes is unclear; the unique surplus intron suggests that they share a common ancestor .

in most mammals, chicken, x. tropicalis and in p. marinus, group v <dig> encompasses a single member, hsp <dig>  uniformly depicting introns at positions 192a, 225a and 300c. in d. rerio, however, there are three hsp47-related genes , all of which are equipped with the standard set of introns . neighbor-joining analyses of hsp <dig> proteins and reference serpins from groups v1–v <dig> confirmed phylogenetic clustering of group v <dig> genes from d. rerio , which probably arose as a consequence of genome duplication events in the stem lineage of ray-finned fishes  <cit> . in the other actinopterygians investigated, the phylogenetic history of group v <dig> is less clear, partly due to the varying status of the still ongoing genome sequencing projects. orthologues of dan_hsp47_ <dig>  as indicated by the conserved gene order  were detected in g. aculeatus, o. latipes and t. rubripes . in g. aculeatus, a second intact hsp <dig> homologue, gast_hsp47_ <dig>  was identified. dan_hsp47_ <dig> and gast_hsp47_ <dig> are orthologous to each other, since they share a set of flanking markers  that proved to be reciprocal best hits in blast searches . currently it is not clear, whether some further hsp47-related sequences present in the genomes of t. rubripes and o. latipes represent incompletely annotated or defective genes. the only hsp47-related sequence detected in the t. nigroviridis genome is incomplete.

the intron patterns of hsp <dig> homologues uncover telling insight into the evolution of group v <dig> in fishes . dan_hsp47_ <dig>  dan_hsp47_ <dig>  dan_hsp47_ <dig>  and hsp <dig> from p. marinus and tetrapods, respectively, all depict the standard intron repertoire. gast_hsp47_ <dig>  oryz_hsp47_ <dig> and fugu_hsp47_ <dig>  however, contain two additional introns ; gast_hsp47_ <dig>  in contrast, merely possesses the default introns. these findings suggest that the novel introns, which are restricted to hsp47_ <dig> orthologues, were acquired by group v <dig> during evolution of ray-finned fishes after divergence of the d. rerio lineage, though an intron loss scenario cannot be excluded. two intron gains or a single, coupled intron gain event are/is sufficient to explain the exon-intron patterns found in group v6; the intron removal scenario, in contrast, requires multiple intron loss events. if such losses had occurred, they must have affected several taxa, including lampreys, tetrapods and fishes. moreover, this scenario also demands that the same two introns  were always deleted in parallel, while all other introns were unaffected. the parallel emergence of introns at positions 77c and 233c in angiotensinogen genes  provides further support for the intron gain presumption.

in contrast with several intron gains, we detected a single case of probable intron loss during evolution of vertebrate serpins. antithrombin , the only member of group v <dig>  is a potent thrombin inhibitor in the presence of heparin. among other characteristic features, at orthologues are easily discernible through a highly conserved sequence centering around helix d  that constitutes a major part of the heparin binding region. the at genes of tetrapods have introns interrupting the serpin scaffold at positions 78c, 148c, 191c, 320a and 339c . the orthologues from fishes, however, exhibit an additional intron at position 262c . this intron is also present in d. rerio and in the currently incompletely annotated at gene of t. nigroviridis . intron 262c is a standard attribute of group v <dig> that is believed to share a common ancestor with group v <dig>  <cit> . we therefore suspect that this intron was lost in at genes of tetrapods. we were not able to identify this gene in p. marinus; further tracing of the 262c intron was therefore not possible.

in serpins from groups v <dig> and v <dig>  deviations from the standard structures were not observed . all genes from group v <dig> analyzed featured introns at positions ~86a-90a, 167a, 230a, 290b, 323a, 352a, and 380a. the intron pattern characteristic of group v <dig>  was also conserved.

discussion
intron gain has been reported to occur very rarely in many metazoan lineages, including mammals and other vertebrates  <cit> . to our surprise we disclosed multiple newly acquired introns by probing a vertebrate protein superfamily, the serpins, while a single intron was presumably lost. the most clear-cut example for intron gain is angiotensinogen that, in lampreys, tetrapods and d. rerio, depicts the typical exon/intron pattern of group v <dig>  the novel introns at positions 77c and 233c, like all other non-standard introns identified, are exclusively found in a group of ray-finned fishes that emerged after the split of the d. rerio lineage. none of the novel intron positions is found in any paralogues of group v <dig> or in any other vertebrate serpins known. thus, from a parsimony standpoint, the view that these introns were acquired de novo is more likely than the alternative possibility that these introns were inherited from a common ancestor. the novel introns were apparently not acquired at the expense of adjacent introns, as concomitant loss of such sequences was not observed. since there are no reports of intron gain in serpins of other vertebrates, our findings may reflect an episode of enhanced intron acquisition that happened during radiation of ray-finned fishes. several of the few other well-documented intron gains also occurred during diversification of these fishes  <cit> .

hsp <dig> genes are especially informative concerning both the time period and the processes possibly associated with intron birth. during evolution of ray-finned fishes, group v <dig> was split into three lineages, probably a consequence of whole genome and/or large fragment duplications. the extra introns at positions 36b and 102c, however, were acquired only by hsp47_ <dig> orthologues after divergence of the d. rerio lineage. hsp47_ <dig> from g. aculeatus, in contrast, depicts the standard intron pattern, just as hsp47_ <dig>  hsp47_ <dig> and hsp47_ <dig> from d. rerio and the members of group v <dig> from lampreys and tetrapods. these findings indicate that intron gains were not associated with the fish-specific genome duplication events, they rather support the view that co-existence of paralogues may favor maintenance of introns once gained. phylogenetic data  <cit>  locate birth of all new introns in serpins to a time period about 320- <dig> mya .

except for spn_94a, the insertion points of novel introns are exact, as no deletions or insertions at the flanking sequences are evident. many serpins tolerate indels without functional impairment, especially in loops connecting α-helices and β-strands, a noteworthy aspect that should be kept in mind in the discussion of intron gain mechanisms. inspection of nucleotide sequences in the neighborhood of novel introns revealed compliance with the proto-splice site sequences proposed  <cit> . a relatively high fraction of bases immediately adjacent to the splice acceptor site are pyrimidine residues, possibly biased due to the limited number of samples analyzed or due to subsequent selection processes. alternatively, this finding may indicate that the specifications required at the 3'-side of intron insertion sites are low.

several mechanisms have been claimed to be responsible for birth of introns  <cit> . key to most of the proposals is duplication events operating at some stage. a popular mechanism thought to mediate intron gain involves transposons. a distinguishing feature of fish genomes is their diversity of retrotransposable elements, notably retrotransposons, some of which were active in recent times  <cit> . however, we could not detect any sequences in non-standard introns sharing similarity with known repetitive elements, participation of duplication-dependent transposons with intron gain therefore remains elusive. preferential loss of such elements from newly acquired introns, however, cannot be excluded. in two recently described cases of intron acquisition, similarity to other genomic sequences was also not observed  <cit> .

we consider that various processes might be responsible for intron birth, not necessarily related with the events responsible for their primordial emergence. excision of introns, probably created by expansion of simple repeats or complex repetitive elements  <cit>  or generated by intronization of exon sequences  <cit> , demonstrates that the spliceosome can do its job as long as the essential splice signals are present, irrespective of how the intron was created. since we were not able to find support in favor of currently discussed mechanisms of intron gain , we consider that introns might also be created by other means. after the fish-specific whole genome duplication, compaction processes resulted in reduction of genome sizes in many actinopterygians  <cit> . deprivation of genomic dna not only entailed loss of complete genes, but also affected intergenic and intronic sequences. intron sizes, for instance, are considerably larger in d. rerio than in pufferfishes. it remains to be investigated, whether all these sequences have gone without leaving any traces behind. loss of genomic sequences is inevitably associated with dna breakage, requiring repair and recombination. the involvement of such processes in intron acquisition should therefore be considered; however, like for the other intron gain mechanisms suggested, conclusive evidence of a causal relationship between dna breakage/repair and de novo intron formation is lacking as yet.

genome-scale or local amplification of genes might conceivably favor gain and maintenance of novel introns, since unaffected copies are left in the genome. the appearance of novel introns in the serpin superfamily, however, was apparently not associated with the fish-specific genome duplication that preceded radiation of ray-finned fishes  <cit> . in current phylogenetic scenarios, divergence of d. rerio, which lacks all of the non-canonical introns, antedates the split of the lineage that experienced intron gains. retention of introns once acquired might indeed be favored by the co-existence of paralogues, relative frequencies of intron gains in single versus multi-copy gene families, however, are discussed controversially  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
by a comprehensive analysis of lineages pre- and postdating the split of vertebrates, the founding period for major groups of vertebrate serpins was ascertained. following establishment of the canonical exon-intron patterns before or close to diversification of lampreys, a lineage of ray-finned fishes is shown to have experienced multiple intron gains. remarkably, in two genes concomitant appearance of non-canonical introns is observed, suggesting that intron gains may even happen in parallel or in a rapidly consecutive manner. these data strongly suggest that intron acquisition occurs in at least some vertebrate taxa. the observation that all intron gain events were found in a lineage of ray-finned fishes that underwent genome compaction, leads us to assume that dna breakage/repair processes may enable or facilitate intron acquisition. angiotensinogen, hcii, and hsp <dig> were identified as ancient members of the serpin superfamily in vertebrates.
