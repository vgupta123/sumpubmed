BACKGROUND
iron is an essential micronutrient for almost all organisms and is used as a co-factor for many enzymes involved in redox-reactions. its reactivity with hydrogen-peroxide also bears the potential to promote the formation of reactive oxygen species via the fenton reaction. reactive oxygen species in turn result in, protein, lipid and dna damage that can lead to cellular dysfunction and damage to organs. consequently, free iron levels must be kept at a minimum, while enough iron must be provided to processes that depend on it .

mitochondria are the sites of iron-insertion into protoporphyrin ix  <cit>  and iron-sulfur cluster  biosynthesis  <cit>  within eukaryotic cells and are, therefore, the subcellular compartments with the highest requirement for iron. transport of iron into mitochondria, is facilitated by the mitochondrial carrier proteins mrs3p and mrs4p   <cit>  in yeast. mrs3/ <dig> genes have been shown to genetically interact with frataxin  <cit>  in the delivery of iron to heme  <cit>  and isc synthesis  <cit>  in mitochondria. at least in yeast, another less effective mitochondrial iron transport mechanism seems to exist, as mrs3/ <dig> mutants only manifest phenotypes at low iron conditions  <cit> .

in vertebrates two paralog genes that are homologs to mrs3/ <dig> exist. mitoferrin <dig>  is mainly expressed in erythropoietic tissues and the frascati mutations in the zebrafish result in hemoglobinization defects, anemia and lethality  <cit> . both mitoferrin <dig> and mitoferrin <dig> can rescue yeast mrs3/ <dig> double mutants, indicating a similar function. only ectopic expression of mitoferrin <dig> can rescue frascati mutants  <cit>  and it was recently shown that mitoferin <dig> protein, but not mitoferrin <dig>  accumulates in erythropoietic cells at amounts that can meet the need of mitochondria for iron in these cells  <cit> .

in a previous study we found that drosophila melanogaster and other invertebrates  have only one mitoferrin gene, which is most likely a functional homolog of vertebrate mitoferrin <dig> as invertebrates lack erythropoiesis  <cit> . study of drosophila mitoferrin  in insect cell culture showed that its dysregulation affects cellular iron homeostasis through the iron-sulfur cluster synthesis pathway  <cit> .

mitochondria play an important role during spermatogenesis. for example, defects in caspase activation involving the spermatogenesis-specific cytochrome gene cyt-c-d  <cit>  or defects in mitochondrial fusion processes, involving the fuzzy onions gene product  <cit> , result in male sterility with defects during spermatogenesis. drosophila melanogaster testes are  <dig> mm long terminally blind tubes. spermatogenesis starts at their apical tip where stem-cell divisions give rise to germ cells  <cit> . each germ cell is contained in a cyst of two somatic cyst cells  <cit>  and undergoes four mitotic divisions, resulting in  <dig> syncytical spermatids after meiosis  <cit> . mitochondrial fusion processes in spermatids result in two giant mitochondrial derivatives per spermatid that furl up to form the nebenkern. during elongation, the mitochondrial derivatives unfurl along the flagellar axoneme. as the individualization complex progresses along the length of the spermatids, each spermatid is wrapped in its own membrane, the minor mitochondrial derivative is depleted of most of its material, and other organelles and most of the cytoplasm are removed from spermatids and accumulate in the cystic bulge, which is cast off at the end of the spermatids as a waste bag  <cit> . after coiling, individualized spermatids are released from their cyst and stored as mature sperm in the seminal vesicle.

here we report on a function of dmfrn during spermatogenesis and characterize its expression in different fly tissues as well as within testis. we show for the first time that the mitochondrial iron metabolism is essential during spermatogenesis.

RESULTS
p-element insertion p{lacw}dmfrnsh <dig> in the 5'-untranslated region of dmfrn results in male sterility
previously we have identified dmfrn , the only drosophila homolog of yeast mrs3/ <dig> and vertebrate mitoferrin <dig>  and studied its role in cellular iron homeostasis in cell culture  <cit> . little is known about the role of mitoferrin <dig> in the whole organism.

to study dmfrn, we obtained four publicly available mutant alleles. three are due to p-element insertions in the 5' untranslated region  of the dmfrn gene and one is a deficiency where dmfrn and a small part of the region in its proximity are deleted ed6277; figure 1a).

the insertion site of p{lacw}lsh115sh <dig> is downstream of the putative transcriptional start  but upstream of the start of the dmfrn-coding sequence . it was recovered during a screen for recessive lethal genes  <cit> , which would be in agreement with iron-sulfur clusters being essential co-factors  <cit>  and the proposed general function of mitoferrin <dig> in mitochondrial iron transport in non-erythroid tissues  <cit> . p-elements p{gt1}mfrnb <dig> and p{epgy2}mfrney <dig> , are both located closer to the putative transcriptional start of dmfrn  and no phenotypes caused by the insertions themselves have been reported. p{epgy2}mfrney <dig> contains an uas sequence upstream of dmfrn and has been used in a gain of function screen, where overexpression of dmfrn in developing muscle apodemes caused muscle misdevelopment  <cit> .

while cleaning the fly lines from background mutations by outcrossing them with wild type flies , lethality of sh115lsh <dig> flies was lost after only three generations. therefore, it was unlikely that the reported lethality was caused by allele sh115lsh <dig> but by another unmarked mutation instead. consequently, the allele sh115lsh <dig> should be referred to as dmfrnsh <dig> 

to our surprise we failed to establish a homozygous stock of dmfrnsh <dig> flies, as male flies were recessive sterile and sterility was completely penetrant. female dmfrnsh <dig> flies were fertile , while male recessive sterility persisted even after outcrossing dmfrnsh <dig> flies for  <dig> generations to w <dig> flies. to confirm that the allele dmfrnsh <dig> was indeed responsible for male sterility, a p-element excision screen, in which the p-element was re-mobilized, was carried out  <cit> . independent lines of flies that had lost the marker for the p-element were established and analyzed by pcr for precise and imprecise excisions  . all precise excisions in trans to dmfrnsh <dig> rescued the recessive male sterility phenotype . these results show that p{lacw}dmfrnsh <dig> causes male sterility.

*the lines exhibited different degrees of lethality

we also analyzed fertility in male flies that carried dmfrnsh <dig> in trans to dfed <dig> or the small deletion dmfrndf <dig> , which was recovered during the hop-out assay, as well as flies that carried dmfrndf <dig> in trans to dfed <dig> or were homozygous for dfed <dig>  all of these combinations of dmfrn mutations resulted in male sterility . to further support the role of dmfrn in male fertility and to rule out that p{lacw}dmfrnsh <dig> interferred with enhancer or repressor elements of other nearby genes, and thereby resulted in male sterility, we performed a genomic rescue experiment using a transgene fly line, which contains the gene region of dmfrn into which we had inserted a c-terminal venus tag . this analysis showed that male sterility of homozygous dmfrnsh <dig> flies as well as sterility of dmfrnsh115/dmfrndf13flies, dmfrnsh115/dfed <dig> flies, and dmfrndf13/dfed <dig> flies was rescued by the transgene dmfrnvenusb <dig> construct . however, male sterility of homozygous dfed <dig> males was not rescued by dmfrnvenusb <dig> , indicating that the sterility of homozygous dfed <dig> males is likely caused by the deletion of one of the three other genes affected by the larger deletion. according to the flyatlas  <cit> , the uncharacterized gene cg <dig> is expressed in nerve tissue, ovaries and testes and is therefore the best candidate for male sterility of dmfrnvenusb32/+; dfed <dig> flies. inspection of testis squashes in these flies showed larger nebenkerns associated with several normal sized nuclei , which is a sign for cytokinesis defects  <cit> . this indicates that cg <dig> might be involved in cytokinesis during spermatogenesis.

the fact that the emergence of homozygous dfed <dig> adult flies was lower than expected , indicates that dfed <dig> causes lethality in addition to sterility. flies with any of the three p-element insertions in trans to dfed <dig> did not show any obvious signs of lethality . male flies with the genomic rescue construct dmfrnvenusb <dig> on the second chromosome, and either the small or the large deletion on the third chromosome, were crossed to female dfed6277/tm6c flies, and offspring were scored. the fractions of dmfrndf13/dfed <dig> and homozygous dfed <dig> flies that carried the rescue construct  were larger than the fractions of flies without the rescue construct  . these results show that the deletion of dmfrn results in partial lethality, indicating an essential role of dmfrn during development to adulthood.

as spermatogenesis uses many processes that are also needed during the normal development of an organism  and the male sterility phenotype of dmfrnsh <dig> flies was completely penetrant, we continued investigating the role of dmfrn during spermatogenesis.

dmfrnsh <dig> causes elongation defects during spermatogenesis
male sterility can result from defects in mating behavior, abnormal anatomy of the sexual organs or defects during spermatogenesis  <cit> . since homozygous dmfrnsh <dig> males were observed mating, behavioral abnormalities were ruled out as the cause of male sterility. dissection of male flies revealed that the testes of homozygous dmfrnsh <dig> flies exhibited a defect during spermatogenesis of variable intensity resulting in the absence of mature sperm, whereas heterozygous testes looked normal and contained motile mature sperm . the severity of the spermatogenesis defect in homozygous dmfrnsh <dig> flies ranged from testes that lacked properly elongated spermatids to those that looked almost like wild type  testes but lacked mature sperm .

by analyzing testes squashes we found that dmfrnsh <dig> spermatocytes  and onion stage spermatids  looked normal, whereas later stages of spermatids showed different defects. we found signs for delayed spermatid elongation . often, we observed abundant white structures of unknown origin in spermatid bundles . sometimes mitochondrial derivatives of elongating and elongated spermatids had bulby protrusions  that are reminiscent of unelongated or improperly elongated mitochondrial derivatives. we also observed elongated spermatids that appeared normal, but never mature sperm. this is supported by the finding that all dmfrnsh <dig> males were completely sterile. all of these results are indicative of an elongation defect in dmfrnsh <dig> testes.

at the ultrastructural level, elongated spermatids of dmfrnsh <dig> testes exhibited great morphological defects compared to those of wt testes. spermatid cysts were unorganized . in testes of dmfrnsh <dig> flies, the major and minor mitochondrial derivatives, associated with axonemes were impossible to distinguish from one another in many cases. often, one axoneme was associated with two mitochondrial derivatives of similar size, and both had accumulated the paracrystalline structure , which is normally typical for the major mitochondrial derivative  <cit> . in some cases, one such mitochondrial derivative was extremely enlarged and contained heterogeneous accumulations of the paracrystalline structure . furthermore, in the same cyst the number of spermatids wrapped in the same membrane was not constant , indicating that if individualization occurred, it was defective.

defects during spermatogenesis can either be primary defects, which are a direct consequence of a mutation or they can be secondary defects, which are the result of primary defects  <cit> . to find out whether possible defects during individualization, as indicated by the above tem results, were preceded by earlier defects that are independent of the elongation defects that we observed under phase contrast, we analyzed whole mount testis of dmfrnsh <dig> flies by confocal laser scanning microscopy. nuclei and f-actin were stained with dapi and rhodamin phalloidin, respectively. in wt testes, nuclei of elongated spermatids were needle-shaped and located at the base of the testis in parallely packed bundles  and individualization complexes present at different positions of elongated spermatids were apparent from well organized actin-cones . even though nuclei of spermatids from dmfrnsh <dig> testes were needle-shaped, they were often scattered over large areas of the length of the testes  or formed fuzzy bundles . despite the presence of parallel organized nuclei in some mutant spermatid bundles, we did not observe actin-cones in the mutant testes we analyzed . however, in one testis we observed the associaton of f-actin with nuclei, which might be indicative for the formation of an individualization complex . so, even though we could not see any actin cones, it may not be ruled out that some spermatids did form individualization complexes and underwent partial individualization. all defects observed in dmfrnsh <dig> testes were rescued in testes of dmfrnvenusb32/+; dmfrnsh <dig> flies .

a parallel organization of the nuclei at the start of individualization is required for the successful assembly of functional individualization complexes. from the above results, it is therefore likely that the defects observed by tem in dmfrnsh <dig> testes are the result of the elongation defects.

dmfrn is ubiquitously expressed with slightly higher expression in testes
mitochondrial ferritin, an iron storage protein, is most abundantly expressed in testes of mice  <cit>  and flies  <cit> , indicating that the mitochondrial iron metabolism, in particular, might play a role during spermatogenesis in insects and mammals.

according to the flyatlas  <cit> , dmfrn expression is lowest in testes, which was rather unexpected in light of our findings. this prompted us to verify dmfrn expression in different tissues by rt-rt pcr. we isolated rna from heads, thoraxes, guts, malpighian tubules and testes of 2- <dig> days old virgin male flies and analyzed the expression levels of dmfrn and other iron metabolism related genes , fer1hch, fer2lch and fer3hch) as well as the house keeping gene rp <dig> 

mitochondrial ferritin  was expressed at extremely low levels in all tissues except for testes where its message was about eight times more abundant than in whole fly homogenates . this expression pattern is in agreement with that of a previous report  <cit>  and is similar to the flyatlas expression data .

transcripts of fer1hch and fer2lch were enriched about twofold in the gut and malpighian tubules but not in testes , which again is similar to the pattern reported in the flyatlas. ferritins of drosophila are involved in iron storage and iron transport , and accumulate in the iron region of the midgut of iron loaded flies  <cit> . higher expression of ferritins in the gut could therefore either be an indication for the mobilization of food iron to other tissues or iron storage.

the expression patterns of dmfrn and fh in our analysis  diverged from the flyatlas data. in all tissues, except for testes, both were expressed at levels similar to that of whole flies. in testes, message abundance of dmfrn and fh were about two-fold higher .

dmfrn is expressed at increased levels in spermatids
the above mentioned results indicate that dmfrn expression in testes is higher than in other tissues. testes contain both somatic cells; i.e, cyst cells and cells of the testis sheath, as well as germline cells of different developmental stages. mitochondrial aggregation and formation of the giant mitochondrial derivatives take place in spermatids  <cit>  and since we observed spermatid elongation defects, we suspected that mitoferrin expression could occur before or during this stage.

p{lacw}dmfrnsh <dig> contains the coding sequence  of the β-galactosidase gene   <cit>  on the same strand as dmfrn  allowing the visualization of the expression pattern of dmfrn in testes through x-gal staining. blue stain was not detectable in testis of w <dig> flies, which were used as a negative control . in testis from heterozygous dmfrnsh <dig> flies, blue stain accumulated in spermatids and was absent from spermatocytes and the rest of the genitalia . x-gal staining of small testis from homozygous dmfrnsh <dig> flies showed the same pattern and only a few spermatids were elongated to a small degree .

to verify the expression pattern of dmfrn and to be able to study the localization of dmfrn protein during spermatogenesis in further detail, we examined testes from dmfrnvenusb <dig> flies under the fluorescence microscope. first, we made sure that the signal of dmfrn-venus protein was clearly discernible from autofluorescence of testes by using w <dig> flies as a negative control . a clear signal of dmfrn-venus protein was visible in elongated spermatids . this expression pattern is similar to the expression pattern of dmfrn obtained through the expression of lacz, confirming that dmfrn is expressed late during spermatogenesis. using confocal microscopy with increased gain, we were also able to detect dmfrn-venus protein in spermatocytes and the testis sheath .

at higher magnification, we observed that dmfrn-venus protein accumulated in elongated spermatids, the region of spermatid individualization, and that a large fraction was disposed of in waste bags . closer inspection of whole mount dmfrnvenusb <dig> testes, using confocal microscopy, confirmed these observations  and showed that dmfrn-venus protein abundance was increased in nebenkerns of onion stage spermatids and in elongated spermatids . during spermatid individualization, dmfrn-venus accumulated in mitochondrial whorls in front of the actin cones of individualization complexes . at the end of spermatid individualization, the bulk of dmfrn-venus had accumulated in cystic bulges and ended up in waste bags .

male fertility of hypomorph dmfrn mutants depends on food iron levels
yeast mrs3/ <dig> double deletions only cause a growth defect on low iron medium  <cit> . we were therefore interested to see whether food iron levels had any effect on fertility of the mfrnsh <dig> mutant. we also wanted to test if the fertility of flies with the two other p-element insertions, which could be kept as homozygous stocks on normal food, were influenced by iron availability.

to be able to quantify and compare fertility of the different p-element mutants, we wanted to use a genetic background that was as similar as possible. therefore, we crossed male dmfrnsh115/tm6c or dmfrney01302/tm <dig> or dmrfnbg00456/tm6c flies with female dfed6277/tm6c flies. eggs were laid on low iron food , normal food and high iron food ) to allow development of offspring under these different iron conditions. males that carried the respective mutant allele over dfed <dig> were collected and fertility was quantified.

dfed6277/tm6c males raised on low iron food were completely fertile , showing that iron starvation by itself did not cause male sterility.

male sterility on normal food was low in dmfrnbg00456/dfed <dig> flies, higher in dmfrney01302/dfed <dig> flies and complete in dmrfnsh115/dfed <dig> flies . supplementation of food with iron increased fertility of dmfrney01302/dfed <dig> flies strongly, while low iron conditions reduced fertility of dmfrnbg00456/dfed <dig> and dmfrney01302/dfed <dig> males drastically . dmfrnsh115/dfed <dig> male flies were completely sterile, regardless of the food they were raised on .

we also observed testes of the different p-element mutants raised on low iron food. testes of tm6c/dfed <dig> flies, which were used as a control, looked like normal wt testes with abundant elongated spermatids and mature motile sperm in the seminal vesicle , showing again, that low iron levels alone do not cause defects during spermatogenesis. testes of dmfrnbg00456/dfed <dig> and dmfrney01302/dfed <dig> flies contained very few elongated spermatids , whereas mfrnsh115/dfed <dig> testes were very small and did not contain elongated spermatids . this, in turn, shows again that dmfrnsh <dig>  which is further downstream in the 5' utr of dmfrn, causes the strongest phenotype.

from these results, and the well established role of mitoferrins in the mitochondrial iron metabolism, we conclude that dmfrn and the mitochondrial iron metabolism are essential for spermatogenesis.

discussion
the yeast homologs of dmfrn and frataxin homolog  have been shown to genetically interact in yeast during iron-sulfur cluster  biosynthesis  <cit>  and heme biosynthesis  <cit> . previously, we have shown that dmfrn rescues yeast mrs3/ <dig> double mutants and that its overexpression alters cellular iron homeostasis  <cit> . in the current study we show that the mitochondrial iron metabolism plays a role during spermatogenesis for the first time directly, through the male sterility phenotypes caused by p-element insertions into dmfrn and the dependence of the hypomorph mutant on dietary iron, and indirectly, through the expression of fh and dmfrn in testes. this is even further supported by the high expression level of mitochondrial ferritin in testis . the fact that frataxin, mitochondrial ferritin and dmfrn/mitoferrin <dig> are all expressed at higher levels in testes of drosophila and mammals  <cit> , indicates that the involvement of the mitochondrial iron metabolism in spermatogenesis is very likely conserved from insects to mammals.

early studies of mammalian spermatogenesis indicated a nutritional function of iron during spermatogenesis. in human seminal plasma, levels of transferrin, an ubiquitous iron transport protein in mammals, are correlated with sperm abundance  <cit> . furthermore, transferrin is produced in sertoli cells  of mammalian testes and delivers iron to germinal cells  <cit> . defects in the mitochondrial iron metabolism, especially the iron-sulfur cluster synthesis pathway, result in cellular iron accumulation  <cit> . increased iron uptake and accumulation in yeast mrs3/ <dig> mutants have been shown  <cit>  and might occur in dmfrn mutants. it has been shown that injection of iron into testes of rats results in sterility and tissue degeneration  <cit> , and similar experiments with other metals do suggest that this might be a general effect of heavy metals  <cit> . however, the fact that nutritional iron loading of dmfrn mutant flies rescued the weaker male sterility phenotypes and that iron starvation enhanced these phenotypes, indicates that the spermatogenesis defects in the testis of dmfrn mutants is not the result of cellular iron overload. we interpret our results as further support for a nutritional function of iron during spermatogenesis. this would also be in agreement with the large variety within the testis development we observed .

the growth defect of yeast mrs3/ <dig> double deletions develops only under iron limiting conditions, and it has been reasoned that other, still unidentified transporters with lower iron affinity could compensate for the lack in mrs3/4p under iron replete conditions  <cit> . deletion of dmfrn results in partial lethality, whereas flies with the p-element insertions in the 5' utr of dmfrn are viable. therefore, we suggest that there is residual dmfrn expression in the p-element insertion lines. in those lines with p-elements integrated closest to the putative transcriptional start site of dmfrn, expression might be high enough to allow nutritional iron loading to compensate for lower dmfrn expression, while dmfrn expression in dmfrnsh <dig> testes would be insufficient to sustain spermatogenesis, even under iron loading conditions. testes are heterogeneous microenvironments and the germ cells are contained within a pair of cyst cells during all stages of development, and the function of cyst cells in drosophila is poorly understood. therefore, it could very likely be that access of germ cells to iron is controlled by cyst cells, and that even iron loading of dmfrnsh <dig> flies cannot provide enough iron for a low affinity transporter to compensate for the lack of dmfrn in dmfrnsh <dig> testes.

several properties and phenomena of spermatogenesis are likely to rely on mitochondrial iron metabolism:  mitochondria of spermatids aggregate to form the giant nebenkerns through fusion processes that depend on mitochondrial activity  <cit> , which in turn depends on the activity of the respiratory chain. several complexes of the respiratory chain contain heme or isc or both as prosthetic groups, linking energy metabolism directly with the mitochondrial iron metabolism. insufficient dmfrn expression could lead to defects in the energy metabolism of the giant mitochondria and interfere with mitochondrial dynamics.  spermatids undergo dramatic morphological changes as they elongate to a length of almost  <dig> mm. this process is most likely very energy craving and, therefore, well functioning electron transport chains should be essential. if the energy metabolism is corrupted, elongation is likely to stop or slow down.  spermatids undergo an apoptosis-like processes during their individualization. the testis specific variant of the heme protein cytochrome c, encoded by the gene cyt-c-d, has been shown to be essential for spermatid individualization  <cit>  and its function might be sensitive to heme deficiency. even though we observed individualization defects that could hint to defects in the apoptosis-like process in spermatids of dmfrn mutants, it cannot be ruled out that preceding defects during spermatid elongation are the underlying cause.

the exact functions of the major and minor mitochondrial derivatives of insect sperm are not clear and several different hypotheses exist. mitochondrial derivatives may be extremely efficient mitochondria or are degenerated mitochondria or modulate the undulation of the sperm tail in a species specific manner  <cit> . during spermatid individualization, a large part of the minor mitochondrial derivative is removed from spermatid tails and is disposed of in waste bags  <cit>  and we found that a large fraction of dmfrn follows this portion of mitochondria. as the sperm tail is stripped from all of its organelles, except for the remaining part of the mitochondrial derivatives, mitochondrial transport is very likely to become obsolete. on the other hand, remaining mitochondrial carriers could clean the cytoplasm from left-over substrates. in drosophila, ferritin resides in the endoplasmatic reticulum  and can be secreted  <cit> . using testes of fer1hchg <dig> flies that express gfp-tagged ferritin heavy chain homolog protein  <cit> , we were able to identify ferritin in close proximity to mitochondrial whorls and its accumulation in waste bags . the close proximity of the er to mitochondrial whorls could be an indication of iron transfer from the fer1hch/ferlch pool to mitochondria to maintain a functional respiratory chain and active cytochrome-c-d.

a recently published article reports that the copper transporter ctr1c in drosophila, is essential for male fertility in a ctr1b mutant background  <cit> . furthermore, ctr1c locates to the cytoplasmic membrane and is expressed in spermatids and elongating spermatids  <cit> , indicating that metals, in general, play an important role during spermatogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
from our findings we conclude, that drosophila mitoferrin and the mitochondrial iron metabolism are essential during spermatogenesis. drosophila and mammalian spermatogenesis have several processes in common  <cit>  and genes involved in the mitochondrial iron metabolism are expressed in testis of both vertebrates and drosophila. therefore, it is not unlikely that our findings are applicable for vertebrates as well. our study provides a first insight and tools in the form of characterized fly mutants, that will aid further investigations concerning the role of iron, and specifically mitochondrial iron metabolism during spermatogenesis.
