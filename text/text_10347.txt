BACKGROUND
gene amplifications or deletions frequently contribute to tumorigenesis. when part or all of a chromosome is amplified or deleted, a change in dna copy number results. characterization of these dna copy number changes is important for both the basic understanding of cancer and its diagnosis. cancer researchers currently use array comparative genomic hybridization  to identify sets of copy number changes associated with the particular cancer or its congenital and developmental disorders. in array cgh, because the clones contain sequences information directly connecting with the genome database, array cgh offers rapid genome-wide analysis at high resolution and the information it provides is directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. bacterial artificial chromosomes  based cgh arrays were amongst the first genomic arrays to be introduced  <cit>  and are routinely used to detect single copy changes in the genome, owing to their high resolution in the order of  <dig> mb  <cit> . more recently oligonucleotide acgh  <cit>  was developed to allow flexibility in probe design, greater coverage, and much higher resolution in the order of 35– <dig> kb  <cit> .

in order to develop effective methods to identify aberration regions from array cgh data, the previous research works focus on both smoothing-based  <cit>  and segmentation-based data processing  <cit> . the array cgh is very noisy. for example, in cdna array cgh data, the signal to noise ratio is often approximately  <dig>   <cit> . research in this area has been active in the last few years. beheshti et al. proposed to use the robust locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplots  method in  <cit> . eilers and menezes  <cit>  perform a quantile smoothing method based on the minimization of the sum of absolute errors to create sharper boundaries between segments. hsu et al.  <cit>  investigated the usage of maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform  in the analysis of array cgh data. they have shown translation invariant wavelets are promising methods for array cgh data smoothing and also observed that the denoising techniques may miss singleton clones that have small changes but somehow are consistent across tumors. in  <dig>  lai  <cit>  compared  <dig> different algorithms for analyzing array cgh data. many smoothing and estimation methods were included in  <cit>  such as cghseg   <cit> , quantreg   <cit> , clac   <cit> , glad   <cit> , cbs   <cit> , hmm   <cit> , modwt   <cit> , lowess  <cit> , charm   <cit> , ga   <cit> , ace   <cit> . lai concluded that wavelet, quantreg and lowess method gave better detection results  than other methods. so, the wavelet based smooth was considered as the promising approach. more recently y. wang and s. wang  <cit>  extended the stationary wavelet  denoising and regression for nonequispaced data, because the physical distance between adjacent probes along a chromosome are not uniform, even vary drastically. however, if a signal is decomposed by using swt or modwt, we get unequal sub-bands and a long high frequency sub-bands. because true cgh signals include many step functions, they contain important information in high frequency. if long high frequency is used to remove noise, maybe, some high frequency true information of cgh will be loosen.

in this paper, we propose to use the stationary wavelet packet transform  to denoise the array cgh data. because, in swpt, all sub-bands are also shift invariant, each sub-band provides a shiftable description of signal in a specific scale as the same swt or modwt. swpt analyzes signal to many equally frequency sub-bands. so, information in both of low and high frequency sub-band are saved. moreover, new bivariate shrinkage function is used in swpt instead of universal thresholding at the first time, soft thresholding  <cit>  and bayesshrink  <cit> . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through theoretical and experimental exploration of a set of array cgh data, including both synthetic data and real array cgh data. the comparison results show that our method outperforms the previous approaches about  <dig> % –  <dig> %. let's see detail results in next section.

RESULTS
in this section, results of our proposed methods such as the swpt and the swpt-bi will be compared to the other efficient smooth methods such as the lowess  <cit> , the quantreg  <cit> , the swti  <cit> , the dtcwti-bi  <cit> . in our experiments, the artificial chromosomes are generated using the methods proposed in  <cit>  and  <cit> . finally, real data examples are showed to make sure that our methods are still better the others.

synthetic data
first, we describe how to create synthesis data as follow.

artificial chromosome generation
willenbrock and fridlyand  <cit>  proposed a simulation model to create the synthetic array cgh data with equally spaced along the chromosome. more recently y. wang and s. wang  <cit>  extended this model by placing unequally spaced probes along chromosome. as suggested in  <cit>  and  <cit> , the chromosomal segments with dna copy number c =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are generated with probability  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the lengths for segments are picked up randomly from the corresponding empirical length distribution given in  <cit> . each sample is a mixture of tumor cells and normal cells. a proportion of tumor cells is pt, whose value is from a uniform distribution between  <dig>  and  <dig> . as in paper  <cit> , the log2ratio is calculated by

  log2ratio=log⁡22), 

where c is the assigned copy number. the expected log2ratio value is then the latent true signal.

gaussian noises with zero mean and variance σn <dig> are added to the latent true signal. till now, we get the equally spaced cgh signal. because the distances between two probes are randomly, the best way to get these distances is from the ucsf humarray <dig> bac array. thus, we create a real cgh signal from the equally spaced cgh signal when the unequally spaced probes are placed on the chromosome. now, we have many artificial chromosomes of length  <dig> mbase which are created by many noise levels σn =  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> .

comparison by rmse
in this section, we will present the results when applying six methods such as the lowess  <cit> , the quantreg  <cit> , the swti  <cit> , the dtcwti-bi  <cit>  and our methods the swpt and the swpt-bi. one thousand artificial chromosomes with seven different noise levels σn =  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  are denoised.

the denoising results of all methods are shown in the figure  <dig>  we can see that the proposed swpt and swpt-bi methods yield the better performance than the others. the swpt and swpt-bi outperform the lowess by  <dig> % – 55% and  <dig> % –  <dig> % respectably, the quantreg by  <dig> % –  <dig> % and  <dig> % –  <dig> % respectably and the swti by  <dig> % –  <dig> % and  <dig> % –  <dig> % in terms of the root mean squared errors . if compared the dtcwti-bi, the swpt-bi gets better by  <dig> % –  <dig> % for seven noise level and the swpt performs better by 1% –  <dig> % for six noise levels . for all noise levels, the swpt-bi consistently achieves much better results than the others.

some examples of wavelet denoising results by using the lowess, the quantreg, the swti, the dtcwti-bi, the swpt and the swpt-bi methods are shown in figure  <dig> at the noise level of σ =  <dig> . in those figures, the black solid lines represent the latent true signals, the blue points stand for the noisy dna copy data log2ratio at the probe loci and the red lines correspond to the denoised data. we should note that the line connecting the denoised data points is only for visualization purpose.

at the copy three c =  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the log2ratio value of the latent true signal is  <dig> , but these values of the quantreg, the swti and the dtcwti-bi based denoised signal in figure  <dig> are from  <dig>  to  <dig> , from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  respectably. these values can cause a mistake when we segment the dna copy number data. however, the denoised data using the lowess, the swpt and the swpt-bi will be segmented correctly as the copy three  because the log2ratio values are from  <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig> . at the copy two c =  <dig> , the denoised data in the second sub-figure  of figure  <dig> has an amplitude of  <dig>  which will make an error in segmentation process, while the denoised data in other sub-figures of figure  <dig> will give a correct segmentation. in this copy, the denoised signals using dtcwti-bi, the swpt and swpt-bi are approximately the latent true signals, while the denoised data using the lowess, the quantreg and the swti have many ripples. at the copy zero c =  <dig> , if we use tpr , the lowess, the quantreg and our methods gave a ratio of  <dig> over  <dig> instead of 17/ <dig> and 14/ <dig> of the swti and dtcwti-bi. however, the denoised signals of the lowess, the swpt and the swpt-bi look better than of the quantreg. at the copy two c =  <dig> , the fourth, fifth and sixth sub-figures's signal  of figure  <dig> look smoother than the others. furthermore, the denoised signals at the first sub-figure  and the second sub-figure  may cause error when segmentation because denoised signals change from - <dig>  to  <dig>   and from - <dig>  to  <dig>  .

from above results, we can see that our proposed swpt and swpt-bi methods with the stationary wavelet packet transform are better than the others. now, real data will be used to test five smoothing methods as follow.

real data examples
in this paper, the bac array data on  <dig> fibroblast cell lines  <cit>  has been used to show that denoising by the swpt and the swpt-bi are better than by the others such as the lowess, the quantreg, the swti and the dtcwti-bi. this data set is from stanford university, which can be freely downloaded at  <cit> . because the true copy number changes are known for these cell lines, we choose these data as a proof of principles. we pick up the chromosome  <dig> of gm <dig> from these data and apply six algorithms for denoising. in figure  <dig>  the number copies are two and four. at the copy two , the swpt and swpt-bi based smoothed signals are smoother than the others. with the copy four, from  <dig>  ×  <dig> kbase to the end of this chromosome, the performance of the lowess, the swpt and the swpt-bi based denoising methods are the better than of the quantreg, the swti and the dtcwti-bi. from the above figures, we can believe that our methods perform better than the others in denoising of real cgh data.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we explored the stationary wavelet packet transform method with the new bivariate shrinkage estimator in array cgh data denoising study. in the simulation situations, the denoising results from the swpt and the swpt-bi are much better  than the previous methods in terms of the root mean squared error measurement at different noise levels. furthermore, we also demonstrate our method by using the real array cgh data. in our future work, we will develop a smoothing and segmentation combinatorial algorithm to improve the aberration regions identification from dna copy number data.
