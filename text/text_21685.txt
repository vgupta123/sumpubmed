BACKGROUND
tlr <dig>  a founding member of the tlr family, is a pattern recognition receptor for lipopolysaccharide  that can induce inflammatory response and cause septic shock  <cit> . stimulation of tlr <dig> by lps results in the rapid activation of transcription factors, the best characterized of which are interferon regulatory factors , the nuclear factor-kappa b  and activator protein  <dig>  families.

in recent years, tens of thousands of long non-coding rnas  have been identified in the mammalian genomes, many of which have been implicated in a range of developmental processes and diseases  <cit> . though most of lncrnas have been primarily studied in the context of genomic imprinting, developmental process and cancer, lncrnas are now emerging as important regulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses  <cit> . mammalian cd11c + dendritic cells produce many thousands of lncrnas when stimulated with lps  <cit> . the lncrna ptprj-as <dig> is highly expressed in macrophage-enriched tissue and transiently induced by tlr ligands with similar pattern to ptprj  <cit> . tlr signaling also induces lncrna-cox <dig>  which serve as both repressor and activator of genes through interactions with various regulatory complexes  <cit> . li et al. identified a lncrna thril regulating tnfα expression through its interaction with hnrnpl during innate activation of thp <dig> macrophages  <cit> . using a global clustering algorithm based on chip-seq signals of rna polymerase ii and h3k4me <dig>  garmire et al. identified a list of putative lincrnas in mouse macrophages  <cit> . most recently, ilott et al. discovered that both canonical lncrnas and enhancer lncrnas regulated the lps-induced inflammatory response in human monocytes  <cit> . however, systemic characterization of lps-regulated lncrnas in mouse bmdms is lacking so far.

more and more studies have suggested that although lncrnas are not specifically targeted in the original array design, a large portion of probes can be reannotated for interrogating lncrna expression  <cit> . compared to rna-seq of low sequencing coverage, microarray data have lower technical variations and higher sensitivity for transcripts with low abundance  <cit> , which is a markedly feature of lncrnas  <cit> . additionally, microarray datasets contain strand information, thus allow for interrogating the expression of antisense lncrnas.

in this study, we aim to explore the activities and potential functions of lncrnas in lps-induced innate immune response in mouse bmdms. to this end, we firstly repurposed different expression microarray platforms to identify lncrnas from reannotated probes. we then performed an integrative expression analysis of these identified lncrnas on publicly available expression datasets on lps-stimulated bmdms. by using qrt-pcr, we validated the expression changes of some lncrnas. we classified the lncrnas to elncrnas and plncrnas according to chromatin status defined by relative levels of h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> surrounding transcription start sites. we further examined the correlation of the expression change between lncrnas and nearest neighboring protein-coding genes. crucially, several lncrnas are near to immune response genes, and these pairs are significantly co-expressed, such as lncrna-nfkb2/nfkb <dig>  lncrna-rel/rel. the majority of lps-regulated lncrnas have at least one binding site among the transcription factors p <dig>  irf <dig>  junb and cjun, further indicating their potential roles in immune response.

RESULTS
reannotating microarray probes for lncrnas in bmdms
to systematically identify lps-regulated lncrna profile, we utilized publicly available microarray datasets and reannotated the probes using a comprehensive computational pipeline as illustrated in figure 1a. from  <dig> published datasets including six different platforms from affymetrix, agilent and illumina , we identified  <dig> lncrnas . we then incorporated evidence of tss by tss-seqs such as cage  <cit>  and nanocage  <cit>  or epigenetic markers to filter the lncrnas. we collected all publicly available mouse tss-seqs to construct a comprehensive database for mouse gene tss annotations. based on the tss database, we discarded the lncrnas with no tss-seq supported or ambiguous tsss overlapping with neighboring protein-coding genes. furthermore, we utilized publicly available chip-seq data  to examine the epigenetic markers around the lncrnas’ tss region. those lncrnas with any epigenetic modifications of h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and polii were retained. this resulted in  <dig> reliable lncrnas with independent transcription evidence . although different platforms differed in the lncrna compositions, they shared a large number of lncrnas . we also reannotated the probes to protein-coding genes for all the platforms for further analysis .figure  <dig>

we classified lncrnas based on their proximity and relative orientation to protein-coding genes . the  <dig> lncrnas with tss evidence were classified as follows: exonic sense , intronic sense , antisense , biodirectional , and intergenic  . the number and distribution of lncrnas among the different classes were: exonic sense , intronic sense , antisense , bidirectional , intergenic  . since majority of exonic sense lncrnas may simply represent fragments of 5′ and 3′ utrs or nonsense-mediated mrna decay  isoforms of protein-coding genes  <cit> , we excluded exonic sense lncrnas from further analysis.

lps-regulated lncrnas in bmdms
based on the reannotated probes, we obtained lps-regulated lncrnas in bmdms from individual datasets, the majority of which have lps stimulation time points ranging from  <dig> to 6 hours. we then used pearson correlation analyses to evaluate the consistency of microarrays within each manufacture and across manufactures. the correlation of all pairs of microarrays is in the range from − <dig>  to  <dig>  . with only a few exceptions, majority of the pairs are showing significant positive correlation. the pairs that had low correlation only because there were limited overlaps between them. the expression pattern of lncrnas in different datasets from the same manufacture had remarkably high correlation . moreover, the expression of overlapped lncrnas could also be largely validated by cross-manufacture datasets . the consistency of lncrna expression represented by multiple probes from different platforms suggests the reliability of probe reannotation. though different platforms of lps-regulated lncrna expression have overall agreements, some varieties also exist. to integrate these microarrays in an unbiased manner, we exploited a recently published robust rank aggregation algorithm  <cit>  . different platforms for protein-coding genes had even stronger consistency , and we also integrated their expression using the same strategy . to validate the results, we randomly selected  <dig> lps-regulated lncrnas to do quantitative rt-pcr  in bmdms stimulated by different concentrations of lps for  <dig>   <dig> and 6 hours . the fold changes determined by qrt-pcr were strongly correlated with integrated microarray analysis result . using bonferroni-adjusted p value  <dig>  as the cutoff, we identified  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated lncrnas upon lps stimulation in bmdms . markedly, the expression change of two upregulated and three downregulated lncrnas significantly stimulated by lps was confirmed by qrt-pcr . as expected, the fold changes of lncrnas showed some dependence on lps stimulation time and concentration. taken together, we accurately recapitulated the lncrna expression changes upon lps stimulation.figure  <dig>

chromatin signatures separate elncrnas and plncrnas
previous studies have suggested that the ratio of h3k4me1/h3k4me <dig> around tsss can separate lncrnas into elncrnas and plncrnas  <cit> . to classify the lncrnas identified from microarrays accordingly, we utilized publicly available histone modification chip-seq data . we calculated the relative ratio of h3k4me1/h3k4me <dig> in a four kb window centered on tsss. of note,  <dig>  of  <dig> lncrnas showed enhancer-like features , while the remaining lncrnas displayed promoter histone signatures  . lps stimulation had marginal effect on the relative ratio of h3k4me1/h3k4me <dig>  thus lncrnas displayed similar enhancer-like or promoter-associated histone signatures in both unstimulated and lps stimulated bmdms . as expected, both elncrnas and plncrnas were enriched with h3k27ac modification, a well-accepted mark of biological activity . these lps-regulated plncrnas and elncrnas can be either induced or repressed by lps stimulation, and no difference was detected between plncrnas and elncrnas .figure  <dig>

it has been well established that histone modification changes are associated with changes of lncrna expression, which is confirmed in our finding. we observed that differences in h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac were positively correlated with changes in both elncrnas and plncrnas expression . h3k4me <dig> was not associated with expression change upon lps stimulation for both elncrnas and plncrnas . polii signal for lps regulated elncrnas and plncrnas was significantly changed upon lps stimulation .

correlation between lncrna and neighboring protein-coding gene expression
lncrnas have been reported to coordinate the regulation of neighboring protein-coding genes through a locus control process  <cit> . we assessed their relative distance and correlation of expression changes to neighboring gene for elncrnas and plncrnas, respectively. interestingly, when considering intergenic and bidirectional lncrnas only, although not significant, elncrnas were in a closer proximity to protein-coding genes than plncrnas . the elncrnas and plncrnas had similar compositions of lncrna classes . although the distance to nearest protein-coding genes for plncrnas is not as close as elncrnas, all the intronic sense, antisense, bidirectional and intergenic elncrnas/plncrnas are significantly co-expressed with neighboring protein-coding genes . intronic sense lncrna expression change has the strongest correlation with protein-coding gene neighbors, compared to other three classes , suggesting that intronic sense lncrnas are probably often co-transcribed with closest mrna genes.figure  <dig>

lps-regulated lncrnas closely related to inflammatory response
we found  <dig> out of  <dig> lps-regulated lncrnas were adjacent to or overlapped with protein-coding genes. adapting the previously proposed nomenclature  <cit> , we renamed the  <dig> lncrna genes based on their neighboring protein-coding genes . notably, the majority of these lncrnas  were positively correlated with neighboring protein-coding genes, while only  <dig> of  <dig> were negatively correlated . of particular interest was lps-regulated lncrnas paired with neighboring protein-coding genes known to play roles in inflammatory response, such as nfkb pathway genes nfkb <dig> and rel . using qrt-pcr, we validated the co-expressed lncrna-nfkb <dig> and nfkb <dig> pairs in bmdms stimulated with various concentrations of lps for  <dig>   <dig> and 6 hours .figure  <dig>

lps-induced transcriptional regulation of lncrnas in bmdms
in resting bmdms, the transcription factors p <dig>  irf <dig> and ap- <dig> family members junb and cjun are sequestered in cytoplasm. upon lps stimulation, these transcription factors are rapidly translocated to nucleus, where they act alone or together with one another to bind numerous gene loci to regulate gene expression. to determine whether these transcription factors were required for transcriptional regulation of lncrnas, we took advantage of published chip-seq data and reanalyzed the peaks. firstly, we found that both lps-regulated elncrnas and plncrnas were enriched for binding sites of the four transcription factors. interestingly, the transcription factors binding sites were enriched in lncrnas whose expression was either increased or decreased after lps stimulation, for both elncrnas and plncrnas . bcl <dig> is a transcriptional factor that binds genes and broadly constrains the inflammatory response through cistromic antagonism of a tlr-nf-κb network  <cit> . we detected the similar enrichment pattern for bcl <dig> before and after lps stimulation.figure  <dig>

of the  <dig> lps-regulated elncrnas and plncrnas identified in bmdms,  <dig> were bound by at least one of the four transcription factors  . p <dig>  irf <dig>  junb and cjun bound to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> lncrnas in bmdms exposed to lps, respectively . of note,  <dig> lncrnas were bound by all the four transcription factors. different transcription factor binding sites of lncrnas were within average  <dig> kb, suggesting that these proteins acted together to regulated lncrna expression. interestingly, the majority of bcl <dig> binding sites  and 100%  in lps-unstimulated and -stimulated bmdms, respectively) colocalized with at least one of irf <dig>  p <dig>  junb and cjun sites after lps stimulation . above findings indicated that irf <dig>  p <dig> and ap- <dig> family member junb and cjun were the major transcription factors that acted in a synergetic manner and regulated lncrnas expression in tlr <dig> signaling pathway, while bcl <dig> antagonized some lncrna binding sites to prevent hyperimmune response. for example, lncrna-ipo <dig> was co-bound by irf <dig> and junb within a small window . out of two potential promoter regions for lncrna-rel, one was bound by p <dig>  irf <dig>  junb and cjun in bmdms after lps stimulation, and the other one was bound by irf <dig> and junb after lps stimulation, while the binding site was antagonized by bcl <dig> under rest condition .figure  <dig>

discussion
previous studies mainly focused on the study of lps-regulated protein-coding genes but ignored the function of lncrnas involved. to explore the potential role of lncrnas in the activation of tlr <dig> signaling, we constructed a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline to reannoate probes to lncrna from literature expression microarray datasets in bmdms. giving that large number of such datasets are available in public repositories, the pipelines we generated will be useful for reannotating array probes to address different biological questions.

our integrated lncrna and protein-coding gene expression profiles are valuable resources for understanding the lps-stimulated program, as well as their co-regulation. having established that lps induced widespread changes in the expression of lncrnas in mouse macrophages situated close to differentially expressed immune response-related genes, it was important to determine whether these were functionally relevant. of great interest was the identification of differentially expressed lncrnas that are located close to two members of ref/nfkb family, nfkb <dig> and ref, which are classical proinflammatory transcription factors known to play critical roles in both innate and adaptive immune response. nfkb <dig> was reported to be upregulated upon lps stimulation in human monocytes  <cit> . our qrt-pcr experiments confirmed the co-expression of lncrna-nfkb <dig> and nkfb <dig>  it is unlikely that the co-regulation of lncrnas and ref/nfkb family was a random phenomenon since two members of this family were found to be co-regulated with lncrnas. given the importance of ref/nfkb family in immune response, a further examination of the function and mechanism for their co-located and co-expressed lncrnas is worth doing. however, our study has limitations to detect known lps-regulated lncrnas due to the lack of probes. previous study indicated that cox <dig> and lncrna-cox <dig> were markedly induced after tlr <dig> stimulation in bmdms  <cit> . due to the lack of probes for lncrna-cox <dig>  we did not detect lncrna-cox <dig> in this study. we performed qrt-pcr to confirm the co-expression of cox <dig> and lncrna-cox <dig> . it should be noted that we applied a stringent strategy to derive a confident list of lps-regulated lncrnas. some interesting lncrnas are also filtered out, such as lncrna-lyn-intron <dig>  previous study has demonstrated that lncrna-lyn spans the first exon and first intron region of lyn and the expression is increased along with lyn upon lps stimulation in bmdms  <cit> . we identify a new lyn associated lncrna, lncrna-lyn-intron <dig> , located at the first intron of lyn and  <dig> kb away from lncrna-lyn, is also upregulated . this lncrna was filtered out because of no clear tss evidence.

recent investigation in erythroid cells has suggested that the lncrnas transcripts are almost evenly divided between elncrnas and plncrnas differentiated by chromatin signatures of h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> surrounding transcription start sites  <cit> . consistent with this observation, we found that bmdms expressed elncrnas and plncrnas were also evenly distributed. a number of elncrnas and plncrnas can be regulated by lps stimulation. nevertheless, plncrnas are more inclined to downregulation upon lps stimulation compared to elncrnas. several previous studies suggested that lncrna expression changes are regulated by epigenetic mechanism including histone modifications such that h3k27ac, h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> are related to enhancer activity  <cit> . similarly, we demonstrated that histone modifications also play important roles in the regulation of lncrnas upon lps stimulation in bmdms. we found that h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac are associated with directionally consistent changes in not only elncrnas, but also plncrnas expression. our studies demonstrate that although distance to nearest neighboring is much nearer in elncrnas compared to plncrnas, these both of two kinds of lncrnas significantly co-expressed with neighboring protein-coding genes. bidirectional transcription has been shown to be a defining feature of a subset of active enhancers in mouse cortical neurons and human fetal lung fibroblasts  <cit> . we have shown that the transcription of bidirectional plncrnas, as well as elncrnas, were lps-stimulation dependent in mouse bmdms.

the gene program stimulated in tlr <dig> signaling pathway requires the coordinative activation of transcription factors, of which the most well characterized are p <dig>  irf <dig>  and ap- <dig> family members junb and cjun. here we demonstrate for the first time that these transcription factors also bind to lncrnas and regulate their expression upon lps stimulation. also, the regulation does not differ between elncrnas and plncrnas. the majority of lps-regulated lncrnas are bound with at least one of these transcription factors. markedly, we also identify the up-regulated and down-regulated lncrnas that are bound by all the four transcription factors, suggesting the widely cooperation of these transcription factors. recent study suggests that bcl <dig> antagonizes p <dig> bindings under rest condition to prevent the hyper-activation of inflammatory genes  <cit> . interestingly, we found that bcl <dig> also binds to a portion of lncrnas and the binding sites can overlap with not only p <dig>  but also irf <dig>  junb and cjun. we speculate these transcription factors may regulate lncrnas in a similar manner to protein-coding genes upon lps stimulation in bmdms.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we have provided a valuable resource of lps-regulated lncrna expression profile, together with many potential co-regulated candidate protein-coding genes. among them, we have identified lncrnas such as lncrna-nfkb <dig> and lncrna-rel that are upregulated along with their corresponding protein-coding genes, which are crucial genes in immune response. although the mechanisms are currently unknown, we speculate that many of the identified elncrnas and plncrnas are important participants of lps-stimulated innate immune response. we also established an integrative microarray analysis pipeline, which opens new avenues for repurposing published genomic data to study the functions and mechanisms of lncrnas in interested biology fields.
