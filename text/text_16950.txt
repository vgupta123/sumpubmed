BACKGROUND
electrical potential differences are generated across the cytoplasmic membranes of animal cells by concentration gradients of ions such as na+, k+, cl- and h+. the maintenance of membrane potential  depends on ion channels, ion pumps and eletrogenic transporters. ion channels also regulate various cell functions such as: electrical excitability of myocytes and neurons  <cit> , cell proliferation  <cit>  and hormone secretion  <cit> . the study of ψ variations require the use of electrophysiological methods  <cit> , the patch-clamp being the gold-standard technique  <cit> , because it allows detailed biophysical characterization of ion channels  <cit>  and, combined with pharmacological tools, the study of their contribution to ψ  <cit> . however, patch-clamp analysis is restricted to one cell at a time, limiting its application for the study of large and heterogeneous cell populations. optical methods for the determination of ψ were introduced by cohen et al.  <cit>  and are an alternative for the study of ψ variations in a large number of cells within a reasonably short period of time. these optical methods are based on the use of fluorescent dyes, which respond to membrane polarity stimuli causing changes in fluorescence  <cit> . combination of optical methods for the measurement of ψ with flow cytometry  techniques opens new possibilities for the study of ion channels in the biology of heterogeneous cell populations.

human t lymphocytes are a good example of a heterogeneous cell population in which the study of ion channels and their contribution for ψ is of great interest. the activation of t lymphocytes during the immune response requires continuous ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane  <cit> . the voltage-gated k+ channel, kv <dig>   <cit>  and the ca2+-activated-k+ channel, kca <dig>  modulate calcium influx by regulating the ψ and providing electrical driving force for continuous ca2+ entry  <cit> . while kca <dig>  blockers are able to prevent proliferation in mitogen-activated lymphocytes  <cit> , blockage of kv <dig>  channels by specific inhibitors, such as margatoxin  prevent proliferation in resting t cells. blockage of kv <dig>  channels causes a depolarization of the ψ leading to a reduction in the intracellular ca2+ concentration  <cit> . as a consequence, cytokine production and cell proliferation are inhibited  <cit> , which attenuates immune response in vivo  <cit> . data in the literature regarding expression of kv <dig>  and control of ψ were obtained with path-clamp techniques on isolated t cells activated in vitro  <cit> . peripheral t cells, however, are composed of non-activated  t cells, pre-activated t blasts and memory t cells. data obtained by optical methods estimate that the ψ of peripheral t cells vary between - <dig> and - <dig> mv  <cit> , suggesting that different subsets of t cells present in peripheral blood have distinct ψ.

the membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent dye oxonol  was chosen due to advantages over other dyes: i) it is non-cytotoxic, ii) not shown to block ion channels and iii) it is not extruded by the glycoprotein efflux pump  <cit> . in the present work we combine oxonol with facs-immunophenotyping techniques in order to characterize the ψ in specific sub-populations of human t lymphocytes  <cit> . we use specific inhibitors of potassium channels to evaluate the role of voltage-gated k+ channels in controlling the ψ in naive and in memory t cells.

RESULTS
validation of facs estimates of ψ
the calculation of ψ was based on the nernst equation: ψ = rt/f*ln, where r is the universal gas constant, t is the absolute temperature, f is the faraday's constant and oxi and oxe are the internal and external concentrations of oxonol, respectively. the calibration curve was determined using different concentrations of extracellular oxonol. since the external and internal concentrations of the dye are equal when the ψ is the same , one can assume a new calibration curve based on oxi. the ratio oxi/oxe was calculated based on the acquisition of a fixed sample  using the same oxe for both. afterwards the ratio value of oxi/oxe was used to calculate the ψ based on the nernst equation  <cit> .

we characterized the variation of ψ in kv <dig> -transfected cho  cells exposed to different concentrations of extracellular k+ . figure 1a and 1b shows the values of ψ measured by patch-clamp and the oxonol fluorescence by facs, respectively. the values of ψ measured by either facs or by patch-clamp were compared . the curves show an overlay in the range of - <dig> to + <dig> mv, indicating the reliability of ψ measurements obtained with facs.

our aim was also to test if this technique could discriminate between distinct ψ generate by different concentration of pharmacological blockers. cho-kv <dig>  cells were treated with two toxins: mgtx  or iberiotoxin  and the ψ was measured by facs . the ibtx was chosen as a control blocker for the kv <dig>  channel, since it is the most potent and high-affinity blocker for the high-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel  and it has none or low affinity for the kv <dig> channels  <cit> . addition of mgtx depolarized cho-kv <dig>  cells on a dose-dependent manner shifting ψ from - <dig>  ±  <dig>  to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  when the concentration of  <dig> nm was used. ibtx, which is a selective blocker of the bkca channel  <cit> , had no effect on the ψ of cho-kv <dig>  cells.

in order to evaluate the ability of this method to distinguish cell populations with different ψ, we used two established cell lines, cho and cho-kv <dig>   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a representative experiment, illustrating the distribution of ψ in cho , cho-kv <dig>  , and in a mixed population containing cho and cho-kv <dig>  cells . the peak channel of ψ in cho-kv <dig>  cells is shifted leftwards as compared to cho cells, and the two cell subsets can be visually distinguished when mixed in the same sample . the mean values of ψ were - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv for cho and - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv for cho-kv <dig>   which are in accordance with data published by defarias et al.  <cit> . addition of  <dig> nm mgtx  had no effect on the distribution of ψ in cho cells , but it depolarized cho-kv <dig>  cells  by shifting the peak channel value of ψ to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv . in the presence of mgtx, cho and cho-kv <dig>  subsets were indistinguishable . addition of  <dig> nm iberiotoxin  had no effect on the distribution of ψ of either cho  or cho-kv <dig>   and, therefore, did not affect the ψ pattern of cell subsets when they are mixed .

these results indicate that it is possible to characterize the ψ of different cell populations using facs and to evaluate the contribution of ion channels for maintenance of ψ by using specific ion channel blockers.

distribution of ψ on peripheral blood lymphocytes
human mononuclear cells from peripheral blood  were immunostained with cd <dig> and cd45ro mab and loaded with oxonol in order to evaluate the ψ in peripheral blood lymphocytes . pbl were gated according to their physical characteristics and the patterns of cd <dig> and cd45ro were analyzed in figure 3a. two subsets of t lymphocytes  can be identified in relation to the expression of cd45ro. thus, cd3+/cd45ro- are in the upper left gate , whereas the cd3+/cd45ro+ are in the upper right gate . figure 3b shows the cd45ro+ subset according to the oxonol fluorescence distribution. the distribution of ψ in cd3+ cells did not always follow a unimodal pattern, as the example illustrated in figure 3b. in two out of six blood donors, we obtained a bimodal distribution of ψ. separation of cd3+ cells according to the expression of cd45ro allowed characterization of ψ in the two cell subsets. thus, cd3+/cd45ro- cells were hyperpolarized in relation to cd3+/cd45ro+ cells , the peak channel values of ψ being - <dig> ±  <dig>  mv and - <dig> ±  <dig>  mv, respectively .

effects of mgtx or high e on the ψ of pbl
in order to characterize the distinct degrees of depolarization upon exposure to mgtx in activated t lymphocytes, we investigated the presence of cd45ro- and cd45ro+ cells in the different samples and evaluated the sensitivity of each cell subset to mgtx. the proportion of cd45ro- and cd45ro+ varied among donors and the individuals with higher amounts of cd45ro+ cells among t lymphocytes  showed significant depolarization upon treatment with mgtx , whereas those with low proportion of cd45ro+ cells  were not affected by mgtx exposure .

in view of these results, we analyzed the distribution of ψ and the effects of mgtx in cd45ro- and cd45ro+ subsets. figure  <dig> shows the results obtained in three out of six donors , which illustrate the different patterns and degrees of response. the cd45ro- and cd45ro+ subsets from each donor are shown in left and right panels, respectively. the cd45ro+ subsets presented a unimodal distribution of ψ in all donors studied. in contrast, cd45ro- subsets had a more variable distribution of ψ, with a bimodal pattern being seen in two out of six donors . addition of high e  depolarized all cell subsets. in contrast, addition of mgtx had no significant effect in cd45ro- subsets  but depolarized cd45ro+ cells, shifting the peak channel value of ψ from - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv . by comparing cd45ro- and cd45ro+ subsets that depolarized at the same extent as high e treatment , we had always 2-fold increase of percentage of cells in the later subset for each donor. percentage of cells was  <dig> and 13%,  <dig> and 64% and  <dig> and 37% .

discussion
the main goal of the present study was to combine the methodology described by krasznai et al.  <cit>  with other facs techniques and the use of specific ion channel blockers in order to study the ψ of t lymphocytes. cho and cho-kv <dig>  cells are well-established cell lines, widely used in electrophysiology  <cit> . the mean values of ψ determined by facs in these cell lines are in agreement with the data from electrophysiological studies  <cit> . the dispersion of ψ values was higher for cho cells  than for cho-kv <dig>  cells . cho cells have their ψ controlled partly by chloride channels and partly by cation channels  <cit> . the transfection of kv <dig>  to cho cells sets the resting ψ to values close to - <dig> mv, similarly to what is observed in human peripheral t lymphocytes  <cit> . the narrower dispersion of ψ values in cho-kv <dig>  cells as compared to cho cells corroborates the idea that kv <dig>  is the main responsible for the control of ψ in these cells. this is confirmed by the fact that mgtx, but not ibtx, depolarizes cho-kv <dig>  cells and enlarges the dispersion of ψ to values similar to those of cho cells .

pbmc are a heterogeneous population, composed of t and b lymphocytes, nk cells and monocytes. expression of kv <dig>  has been reported in t and b lymphocytes and in monocytes/macrophages  <cit> . in the present study, we evaluate the ability of kv <dig>  channel to control the ψ in different t lymphocyte subsets, allying an optical method for determination of ψ by facs with immunophenotyping techniques. human t lymphocytes were identified by the expression of cd <dig> and subdivided into cd3+/cd45ro- and cd3+/cd45ro+ cells. thus, cd3+/cd45ro- cells include naive and recently activated t lymphocytes, whereas cd3+/cd45ro+ correspond to memory t lymphocytes  <cit> . the proportion of cd3+/cd45ro- and cd3+/cd45ro+ varied among different donors  reflecting the dynamic regulation of the immune system.

when analyzed together, cd3+ cells showed different patterns of ψ distribution and variable sensitivity to mgtx, suggesting that the t lymphocyte subsets have different ψ and are differently regulated by kv <dig> . accordingly, it has been recently shown that naive and memory t cells have differences in the expression of kv <dig>  and kca <dig>  channels. thus, naive cells express about 200– <dig> kv <dig>  channels along with 8– <dig> kca <dig>  channels per cell, whereas memory t cells may have up to  <dig> kv <dig>  channels/cell  <cit> . the markers for discriminating naive and memory t cells used in this study are different from the ones published by wulff et al.  <cit> , nevertheless there is an overlap between the subsets studied. in view of this channel distribution, it would be expected that cd3+/cd45ro+ cells, were hyperpolarized in relation to cd3+/cd45ro- cells, unlike the results shown in figure  <dig>  however, cd3+/cd45ro- cells include naive and recently activated t blasts  <cit> , and the latter express 500– <dig> kca <dig>  channels, which have been shown to shift the ψ to - <dig> mv  <cit> . thus, the broad distribution of ψ  within cd3+/cd45ro- cells may be due to the presence of activated t blasts in the peripheral blood of some donors. accordingly, cd3+/cd45ro- cells were not significantly depolarized by mgtx, suggesting a minor role of kv <dig>  channels among these cells.

memory t cells comprehend two sub-populations, which have been classified as central memory  and effector memory  cells, based on their homing potentials and effector functions  <cit> . these two memory cell subsets differ in relation to the expression of kv <dig>  and kca <dig>  channels. tcm cells have 250– <dig> kv <dig>  channels/cell and up-regulate kca <dig>  from  <dig> to 500– <dig> channels/cell following activation, whereas tem cells up-regulate kv <dig>  channels to 1500– <dig> channels/cell and down-regulate kca <dig>  to 50– <dig> channels/cell after repeated activation  <cit> . in the present study, we did not distinguish these two memory t cell subsets and we are aware that further experiments are necessary to study these t cells subsets and examine the effect of kv <dig>  and kca <dig>  channels blockers. nonetheless, our results corroborate the notion that kv <dig>  channels are the main responsible for the control of ψ among memory t cells, since mgtx caused significant depolarization. it is noteworthy, though, that the depolarization was partial in some cases , suggesting the presence of a less sensitive subset . the correlation between a specific channel and its ability to maintain the resting potential of a particular population of cells requires the use of more specific blocker since many of the available pharmacological channel blockers target more than one channel. nevertheless, we can suggest that the kv <dig>  channel is involved in the regulation of ψ from the cd3+/cd45ro+ subset of t lymphocytes .

the fact that kv <dig>  channel is functionally restricted regarding tissue distribution together with the improvement of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  <cit>  and delayed type hypersensitivity in animal models without causing obvious side effects has made kv <dig>  an interesting therapeutic target  <cit> . a rapid screening of new ion channel blockers and the determination of the exact subset of cells affected by these blockers would be of great interest in the development of new immunossupressive therapies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results indicate that facs determination of ψ can be used for identification of ψ heterogeneity among cell populations. combination of this method with other facs techniques could also be used for determination of ψ in different cell cycle phases, developmental stages or activation patterns and for rapid screening of new ion channel blockers. this represents a new strategy for studying the role of ion channels in cell growth and differentiation of normal and tumoral cells.
