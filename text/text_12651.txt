BACKGROUND
human-associated microbes outnumber human cells by a factor of ten  <cit> . the majority of these microbes are harbored in the gastrointestinal tract  and play a strong role in determining an individual’s health  <cit> . commensal git microbes may modulate nutrient uptake and utilization, promote git development and maturation, extract energy from indigestible non-starch polysaccharides, maintain a healthy immune system, and regulate brain development and behavior  <cit> . many diseases, ranging from neurological disorders, such as parkinson’s disease  <cit> , to git-related diseases, such as crohn’s disease   <cit> , ulcerative colitis   <cit> , irritable bowel syndrome  <cit>  and obesity  <cit> , are correlated with disturbed microbiotas that differ from those of healthy individuals according to some studies. surveying the microbial diversity in the git of patients diagnosed with cd and uc found differing levels of microbial diversity between healthy and diseased git samples  <cit> . evidence examining git from obese humans and mice exhibited a markedly decreased fraction of bacteroides and a remarkably increased fraction of firmicutes <cit> . these studies suggest a strong link between git microbial composition and the git-related diseases. recent work has correlated the alleviation of disease symptoms with treatments that alter the microbiota such as fecal transplants  <cit> . for example, recurrent clostridium difficile-associated infections have been treated using fecal microbiome transplantation   <cit> . the study showed that after two weeks, patient prognosis vastly improved and correspondingly, the fecal bacteria composition of the patient became similar to that of the healthy donor  <cit> . while many of these results are preliminary  <cit>  in nature, they all point to an area of rich research and the growing importance of the git microbiota.

the git microbiota composition has profound health implications. modern characterization of git microbes is based on culture-independent methods using 16s ribosomal rna gene  hypervariable tag sequencing technologies  <cit> . 16s rdna is the most widely used marker for microbial species identification  <cit> . currently, next-generation 16s rdna-based sequencing produces millions of sequences from single run. this advance in sequencing technologies, however, represents a significant methodological challenge. widely used methodologies include libshuff  <cit> , analysis of molecular variance   <cit> , parsimony tests  <cit>  and unifrac  <cit> . libshuff uses the cramer-von mises statistic to assess whether or not two microbial communities have the same structure  <cit> . amova determines whether or not there is a significant difference between the diversity within the two populations and the diversity of all the populations pooled  <cit> . parsimony tests describe whether or not two community structures significantly differ from each other  <cit> . unifrac uses phylogenetic information to detect differences between two microbiotas  <cit> . one weakness of the above methods is that they rely on multiple alignments and/or phylogenetic inference, making them time consuming and requiring exceptional expertise and computational resources. small changes in algorithms and parameters can have significant influences on the results of microbiota comparisons  <cit> . the issue created by multiple alignments and phylogenetic inference is the rapid growth of the search space for identifying the optimal multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees with the number of sequences  <cit> . as the ability to sequence continues to outpace advances in computer hardware, more efficient computational algorithms with little or no sacrifice to accuracy will become necessary.

data-compression techniques based on the notion of kolmogorov complexity provide an alternative for microbiota comparisons that bypasses multiple alignments and phylogenetic inference. kolmogorov complexity is defined as the minimum amount of information to reproduce a set of data  <cit> . as such, kolmogorov complexity serves as a measure of the repetitiveness within a data set—a powerful proxy for measuring the similarities and differences between datasets  <cit> . however, this theoretically defined concept cannot be computed exactly. instead, compression algorithms are often used as an approximation for the kolmogorov complexity  <cit> . the idea of using compression-based metrics on biological data has a long and established history. data-compression techniques have been used to construct phylogenetic trees  <cit> , analyze mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , classify protein sequences  <cit> , quantify the time-evolution of macrophage gene expression  <cit> , and classify 16s rdna sequences at family level  <cit> . here, we extend the application of a data-compression method for microbiota comparisons based on the repetitive nature of 16s rdna hypervariable tag sequencing.

in order to efficiently assess differences in git microbiota compositions, we develop a simple, rapid, and accurate method called compression-based distance  to quantitatively analyze similarities between microbiota samples. as shown in figure  <dig>  we characterize the similarities between microbial communities via the amount of repetition or overlap in order to determine microbial community distance. cbd relies on the fact that the more repetitive data is the more it can be compressed. by combining 16s rrna hypervariable tag data from different samples and assessing the relative amounts of compression, we gain a proxy for the similarities between the communities. we convert this to a distance with a minimum of  <dig> and a maximum of  <dig> by taking compression gained by combining the datasets over the total compressed size of the individual datasets.

one advantage of cbd is that it operates more directly on the quality-filtered sequence data to generate distance matrices, thus omitting the need for expert intervention in multiple alignments and phylogenetic inference. in this study, three previously published git microbiota datasets were used to demonstrate simplicity, speed and accuracy in the application of cbd on git microbiotas comparisons. although compression algorithms can be parameterized to achieve different levels of compression, our applications of these algorithms were done without any significant parameter tuning, highlighting an important practical advantage of cbd.

RESULTS
cbd provides a one-shot method for determining the level of similarities between two microbiotas. cbd omits the need for expert interventions in assigning similar sequences to otus as well as aligning sequence reads, generating phylogenetic trees, realigning sequence reads, and choosing proper software and parameters. for comparison purposes, we used the microbiota analysis toolboxes mothur and qiime which have implemented automated to semi-automated functions for microbiota comparisons such as unifrac   <cit> .

“interface” indicates how a user communicates with a computer; “otus” indicates that clustering methods or algorithms, such as cd-hit, blast, furthest neighbor and nearest neighbor, must assign similar sequences to operational taxonomic units  to generate a distance matrix; “alignment” indicates methods such as pynast, muscle, and silva required to align sequences for generating a distance matrix; “phylogenetic tree” indicates methods such as fasttree are needed to produce a phylogenetic tree to generate a distance matrix; “software” indicates a user needs to select different methods or algorithms for choosing otus, align sequences and build a phylogenetic tree; “parameters” indicates a user must choose different parameters associated with a corresponding software.

we test the computational efficiency of cbd and find it to be dramatically faster for tested sizes of sequences than the popular alternative microbiota comparisons methods, e.g., qiime and mothur, which are also capable to taking an input dataset and outputting a microbial comparison in an automated fashion . furthermore, the advantages of cbd grow as the size of the input files increased.

in order to assess the accuracy of cbd, three published datasets were chosen to repeat previous analyses using distances obtained from cbd:  human git microbiota  <cit> ;  humanized mouse git microbiota  <cit> ; and  human mucosa-associated microbiota  <cit> .

human git microbiota
turnbaugh et al. <cit>  used unweighted unifrac to analyze a total of  <dig> , <dig> v <dig> and v <dig> bacterial 16s rdna sequences from fecal samples of  <dig> individuals . the average sequences per v <dig> and v <dig> sample were  <dig>  ±  <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. this revealed that family members had greater similarity in their git microbiota composition than unrelated individuals; there is a much greater resemblance in the git microbiotas of lean or obese related individuals than lean or obese unrelated individuals  <cit> . the data were then reanalyzed and compared with previously published results.

for consistency, we only consider comparisons that resulted in statistically significant differences between groups. comparisons using cbd analysis on v <dig> 16s rdna sequences between family and non-family were consistent with the analysis using unifrac   <cit> . analyses on v <dig> 16s rdna datasets showed that cbd recaptured the conclusions from previous analyses. however, v <dig> 16s rdna datasets averaged about  <dig>  reads, whereas clinically, one would prefer to utilize shallower sampling of the git microbiota for cost efficiency with the same confidence level. v <dig> 16s rdna datasets had an average of about  <dig>  reads and were used to test the performance of cbd under a restricted information circumstance. comparisons using cbd analysis on v <dig> 16s rdna sequences were consistent with the analysis using unifrac   <cit> . analyses on v <dig> 16s rdna datasets revealed that cbd performed well as unifrac on computing similarities among multiple microbiota categories. cbd using 16s rdna sequences provided sixteen out of sixteen distance relationships matching those found by turnbaugh et al.   <cit> .

humanized mouse git microbiota
turnbaugh et al. <cit>  used unweighted unifrac to analyze v <dig> 16s rdna sequence data to investigate the effect of diet on humanized murine git microbiota composition. they transferred fresh or frozen human feces into germ-free mice and observed the effect of a dietary switch from low-fat to high-fat diet on humanized mouse git microbiota. they also transferred microbiota from humanized mice fed low-fat or high-fat diet into germ-free mice to observe the effect of the diet switch from low-fat to high-fat diet on humanized mice. they revealed that the dietary switch induced changes in the composition of humanized git microbiota within one day. samples taken from mice on a low-fat diet with transplanted microbiota from mice on high-fat diets and mice on a high-fat diet with transplanted micro biota from mice on low-fat diets showed intermediate clustering by day  <dig> while clustered in accordance with recipient diet by day  <dig>  the v <dig> 16s rdna sequence data were reanalyzed using cbd to determine the impact of diet manipulation on humanized git microbiota composition. cbd analyses of v <dig> 16s rdna sequences were consistent with those analyses using unifrac   <cit> .

human mucosa-associated microbiota
walker et al. <cit>  determined the effects of disease on human git microbiota compositions. full-length mucosa-associated bacterial 16s rdna from inflamed and non-inflamed regions of  <dig> uc and  <dig> cd patients were compared to those from  <dig> healthy controls. their study revealed that mucosa-associated microbiotas clustered as individuals rather than by disease cohort. cbd was used to reanalyze the data to reveal the relationships between diseased and healthy git microbiotas. the cbd analyses using full-length 16s rdna sequences were consistent with the analysis using unifrac   <cit> .

discussion
the development of advanced and cost-effective dna sequencing techniques enables the generation of tremendous datasets. for example, three recent studies reported that illumina gaiix or hiseq platform produced millions of reads  <cit> . to accommodate this high-throughput data generation, simple and fast tools are extremely important for efficiently and accurately extracting information to further characterize microbiota. increasing the efficiency of microbial community comparisons has profound implications for research. the cbd method described here facilitates efficient similarity comparisons between microbiotas.

cbd generates the distance matrix directly from sample sequences in relatively few steps. in contrast, the tree-based metric required multiple steps including assignment of otus, alignment, production of phylogenetic trees and generation of a distance matrix  <cit> . furthermore, caporaso et al. <cit>  determined that approximately 92% of the computational time was devoted to picking otus rather than determining distance assessment. compared to qiime and mothur, cbd required much less time completing the distance matrix from large numbers of sequences.

the accuracy of cbd was demonstrated by the reproduction of the statistical relationships between different classes of microbiotas and the ability to reproduce the results from microbial comparison using various methods. in this way, cbd was shown to be a robust and useful tool. however, we note that cbd is not a wholesale replacement for more involved analyses. for example, cbd does not provide information such as taxa or otu distributions. it provides a simple, rapid, and accurate metric for comparing distances between entire communities of microbes, not a fine-grained assessment of particular species within a community.

the simplicity, speed, and accuracy of cbd suggests that it facilitates microbiota research when used in human-related samples. it does not require enormous sequencing depths obtained from non-invasively collected stool samples, and it is relatively simple for a biological/clinical researcher to compute cbd values. there is increasing evidence advancing the application of git microbiota assessments. smith et al. <cit>  have implicated the git microbial composition as a causal factor of kwashiorkor. qin et al. <cit>  reported that the git microbiota of cd patients could be differentiated from that of healthy controls and uc patients based on the abundance of  <dig> bacterial species. khoruts et al. <cit>  observed two weeks after fecal transplantation that fecal microbes of clostridium difficile-associated disease patients were similar to those of healthy donors. in a recent study, switching mice from a low-fat diet to a high-fat diet was shown to abruptly change the population of git microorganisms within one day  <cit> . potentially, cbd could aid more informed microbial management by comparing the microbiota before, during, and after manipulation. it could facilitate the exploration of new treatment strategies, and it could be used for diagnosis and prognosis of git-related diseases.

the focus of this work was to explore cbd as a tool for microbiota community comparison with a focus on clinical applications. however, the principles behind cbd should be equally applicable to any set of sequenced amplicons. this may be useful in other studies related to the microbiota that focus on fungal or other eukaryotic organisms in the gastrointestinal tract or other environments by examining 18s rrna hypervariable tag sequencing or internal transcribed spacer regions .

CONCLUSIONS
cbd provides a simple, rapid but accurate method for microbiota comparisons. it uses the relative compression of combined and individual datasets to quantify overlaps between two microbial communities, therefore is independent of multiple alignments and phylogenetic inference. cbd worked directly on sequence datasets without intermediate steps. the speed advantages of cbd over pipelines in qiime and mothur became more pronounced as dataset size increased. tests run on previously analyzed data indicated strong agreement between cbd and more time-consuming analyses.
